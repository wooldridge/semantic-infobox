ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper seeks to identify the correlates of poverty by&#13;
examining in detail the composition and characteristics of the poor&#13;
in Bogota. This is done by analyzing two household surveys for Bogota&#13;
in detail. The poor are defined as those who fall on the botton 30%&#13;
of household income per capita. This cut off point is based on&#13;
other information which indicates that this is also the proportion&#13;
of malnourished in Bogota. Although it is found that larger&#13;
households are more likely to be poor, small households who are&#13;
poor are likely to be poorer still. Clearly, people with lower&#13;
education are more likely to be poor but there are significant&#13;
proportions of those with secondary and higher education who are&#13;
also poor. Some life cycle effects are reflected in the fact that&#13;
poverty is over-represented among children and middle-aged (35-44).&#13;
Poverty is not concentrated anywhere spatially. There is considerably&#13;
higher unemployment among the bottom deciles with about half of all&#13;
the unemployed being in the bottom 30%. Furthermore, participation&#13;
rates are extremely low for the poor giving support to the discouraged&#13;
worker hypothesis. Among workers the poor are predominantly blue&#13;
collar workers and they tend to work long hours. They are not in&#13;
that sense underemployed. Smaller firms do appear to pay less than&#13;
large firms. Spatially the poor are about equally represented in&#13;
every ring but highly concentrated in the South of the city. The&#13;
poor have higher rates of unemployment at all levels of education.&#13;
In addition, the poor who do have higher education appear to have&#13;
low participation rates as well as high unemployment. It would&#13;
thus appear that the poor who attempt to "make it" have difficulty&#13;
getting jobs.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
Este documento presenta un estudio en el que se tratan de identificar&#13;
los factores correlacionados de la pobreza examinando detalladamente la composi-&#13;
ci6n y caracteristicas de los grupos de poblaci6n pobre en Bogota. Con tal fin&#13;
se han analizado minuciosamente dos encuestas de unidades familiares llevadas a&#13;
cabo en esa ciudad. Se definen como pobres a los grupos que en la escala de&#13;
ingresos per capita de unidades familiares caen en la categoria del 30% mas&#13;
bajo. Este limite de inclusi6n se basa en otra informaci6n que indica que tam-&#13;
bi6n esa es la proporci6n de poblaci6n malnutrida en BogotA. Aunque se observa&#13;
que las unidades familiares mas numerosas tienen mayores probabilidades de ser&#13;
pobres, tambi6n las pequefias que son pobres pueden empobrecerse mas. Evidente-&#13;
mente las personas con un menor grado de educaci6n tienen mas probabilidades de&#13;
ser pobres, pero hay una proporci6n considerable que tiene educaci6n secundaria&#13;
y superior y que tambi6n es pobre. Ciertos efectos de los ciclos de la vida se&#13;
reflejan en el hecho de que hay una mayor concentraci6n de pobreza entre los&#13;
nifios y las personas de edad mediana (de 35 a 44 afios). En ninguin caso la&#13;
pobreza esta localizada en una sola zona. Hay un nivel considerablemente mas&#13;
elevado de desempleo entre las decilas mAs bajas de la escala, y aproximadamente&#13;
la mitad del total de desempleados corresponde al 30% inferior. Ademas, las&#13;
tasas de participaci6n de los pobres son sumamente bajas, lo que sustenta la&#13;
hip6tesis de que existe el fen6meno del trabajador desalentado. Entre los tra-&#13;
bajadores, los pobres son predominantemente obreros y por lo general trabajan&#13;
jornadas muy largas. En ese sentido no estan subempleados. Se observa asimismo&#13;
que las empresas pequefias pagan salarios mas bajos que las grandes. En terminos&#13;
de ubicaci6n espacial los pobres se encuentran representados en una proporci6n&#13;
aproximadamente igual en todos los cinturones urbanos, pero hay una mayor con-&#13;
centraci6n en la parte sur de la ciudad. La poblaci6n pobre registra tasas de&#13;
desempleo mas elevadas cualquiera que sea su nivel de educaci6n. Ademas, los&#13;
pobres que tienen educaci6n superior parecen registrar tasas de participaci6n&#13;
bajas y tasas de desempleo elevadas.   Por consiguiente, se tiene la impresi6n de&#13;
que los pobres que tratan de superar esa condici6n tienen dificultad de obtener&#13;
empleo.&#13;

Ce document cherche A tracer un tableau d'ensemble de la pauvrete a&#13;
Bogota en etudiant dans le d6tail la composition et les caracteristiques&#13;
de la population pauvre. Pour cela, les auteurs ont analys6 deux enquetes&#13;
effectuees aupres des menages de la ville. Sont consider6s pauvres les&#13;
30 % des menages dont le revenu par habitant est le plus faible. Ce pour-&#13;
centage a et6 retenu parce que, d'apres d'autres donn6es, il correspond&#13;
egalement a la proportion d'habitants mal nourris. On a observe que la&#13;
pauvret6 frappait davantage les familles nombreuses, mais aussi que les&#13;
petites familles qui etaient pauvres l'etaient probablement plus que les&#13;
autres. De toute 6vidence, les pauvres se trouvent surtout parmi ceux&#13;
dont le niveau d'instruction est le plus faible mais aussi parmi ceux qui&#13;
ont fait des 6tudes secondaires et superieures. Certains groupes d'age&#13;
sont plus touch6s que d'autres : la pauvrete est beaucoup plus importante&#13;
parmi les enfants et les personnes d'age moyen (35-44 ans). Si l'on con-&#13;
sidere la repartition spatiale de la pauvrete, on s'aper9oit qutelle n'est&#13;
concentree nulle part. Le ch6mage est beaucoup plus elev6 dans les&#13;
d6ciles inferieurs, la moitie environ des ch6meurs se trouvant parmi les&#13;
30 % de menages au revenu le plus faible. En outre, les taux d'activite&#13;
sont extremement faibles parmi les pauvres, ce qui incite A penser que&#13;
beaucoup ont renonce A chercher un emploi. Les pauvres qui sont employes&#13;
sont essentiellement des ouvriers dont la journee de travail est longue.&#13;
On ne peut donc pas dire qu'ils soient sous-employes. Il semble que les&#13;
petites entreprises payent moins que les grosses firmes. Sur le plan spa-&#13;
tial, les pauvres sont A peu pres 6galement repartis entre les diff6rents&#13;
secteurs, mais c'est dans le sud de la ville qu'ils sont le plus nombreux.&#13;
Le taux de ch6mage est plus 6leve parmi les pauvres, A tous les niveaux&#13;
d'6ducation. En outre, le taux d'activite est faible et le taux de ch6-&#13;
mage eleve parmi les pauvres qui ont fait des etudes superieures. Il sem-&#13;
blerait donc que les pauvres qui veulent "r6ussir" aient des difficultes A&#13;
trouver un emploi.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
A rather large amount of data handling, documentation and preparation&#13;
has gone into the work leading to this paper. We would like to thank Alan&#13;
Carroll for the original cleaning and documentation of the 1975 and 1977&#13;
household survey; Bob Marshall for help in preparing some of the tables;&#13;
Mattie McCarter for the laborious typing involved in the many tables and&#13;
finally, Manfred Wilhelm Wagner-Luna for most of the tabulations from both the&#13;
surveys that went into this paper. His has been work much beyond the call of&#13;
normal duty. A special word of appreciation goes to the staff of DANE for&#13;
having painstakingly conducted the surveys and for making them available in&#13;
almost raw form so readily.&#13;
This paper is part of a program of research currently being conducted&#13;
by the World Bank on Bogota and Cali, Colombia. The goal of the program,&#13;
entitled The City Study, is to increase our understanding of the working of&#13;
five major urban sectors - housing, transport, employment location, labor&#13;
markets and the public sector - in order that the impact of policies and&#13;
projects can be assessed more accurately. This paper is part of the labor&#13;
market and income distribution portion of the study which is coordinated by&#13;
Rakesh Mohan. Other Project Papers in this series are:&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1 Context of This Study&#13;
This paper forms part of a large program of research grouped&#13;
under the rubric of the "City Study" of Bogota, Colombia, being conducted&#13;
at the World Bank. The goal of the city study is to increase our under-&#13;
standing of the workings and interactions of five major urban sectors -&#13;
housing, transport, employment location, labor markets and the public&#13;
sector - so that the impacts of policies and projects in urban areas can&#13;
be assessed more accurately. The study emphasizes the conditions of low&#13;
income households in terms of employment opportunities, housing consumption&#13;
and the level of public services available to them. The program of research&#13;
has three distinct phases: description, hypothesis testing and estimation&#13;
of behavioral parameters and the development of policy impact models.&#13;
This paper is the second in the series under the general head of labor&#13;
markets and will be followed by studies somewhat more analytical in nature.&#13;
1.2 Objectives&#13;
This paper seeks to identify the correlates of poverty by&#13;
examining in detail the composition and characteristics of the poor in&#13;
Bogota. One approach towards the identification of the poor would be&#13;
the estimation of income equations (or earnings functions). Subsequently,&#13;
the factors leading to low incomes can be identified and the causes of&#13;
poverty delineated. Here, however, the aim is more to identify and&#13;
describe and less to explain. Furthermore, the variety of experience&#13;
that is found among the poor tends to get lost in a more analytical&#13;
summary approach. We attempt, in this paper, to lay out some of the more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
interesting of the myriad ways by which the poor can be described through&#13;
the use of cross tabulations. The poor are identified largely by comparing&#13;
their distribution with the overall distribution.&#13;
A large amount of attention has been paid in many works 1/ to the&#13;
"urban informal sector". Much energy has gone into the appropriate defini-&#13;
tion of this elusive concept. It has been variously taken to include all&#13;
those earning less than a minimum wage; or all those working in small&#13;
(or unenumerated) establishments; or all those working in service occupa-&#13;
tions, and so on. It seems to us that the correct objective of policy&#13;
should be the identification of and removal of poverty regardless of&#13;
whether people work in small or large establishments, whether they are&#13;
enumerated in economic censuses or not or whether they work in manufac-&#13;
turing or service occupations. Such criteria should only be important&#13;
if it is found that poverty is related with the characteristics of certain&#13;
employment conditions.&#13;
The questions being addressed here are simply "Who are the poor?&#13;
What do they do and where do they live?" Are they unemployed, underem-&#13;
ployed or overworked? Are they young or old? Are they predominantly&#13;
males or females? Are they concentrated in certain occupations or indus-&#13;
tries of activity? Are they migrants or non-migrants? These are fairly&#13;
standard traditional questions to ask in such an enquiry. The additional&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
dimension investigated here is that of space. Are the poor concentrated&#13;
in certain parts of the city? Is there some indication that people are&#13;
poor because they are spatially disadvantaged? Such are the questions&#13;
and concerns addressed in this paper. In addition, data sources are&#13;
examined in some detail to comment on problems associated with (i)&#13;
the use of sample surveys of households for the purpose of drawing&#13;
strong conclusions, and (ii) the use of a series of surveys for examining&#13;
time trends.  To this end, all tabulations are reported br both the years&#13;
1975 and 1977 from which data are examined. This serves a dual purpose:&#13;
on the one hand the differences between the result of the two surveys&#13;
point to the hazards of using one to reach strong conclusions; and on the&#13;
other hand, the similarities between the two surveys suggest robustness&#13;
of the results giving confidence in our conclusions.&#13;
1.3 The Data&#13;
The City Study has assembled a data bank of existing sources of&#13;
data in Bogota and Cali, Colombia in the form of copies of the original&#13;
computer tapes prepared by the respective originators of the data. All&#13;
have been documented in Nelson Valverde (1978). This study utilizes two of&#13;
these data sets; both originally collected by DANE. 1/&#13;
DANE has conducted a regular program of household surveys from&#13;
1970 with the main objective of collecting information on the labor force.&#13;
Since 1975 these surveys have been quarterly and are conducted alternatingly&#13;
in the four largest cities and the seven largest cities along with an&#13;
1/ DANE: Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (National&#13;
Statistical Agency of Colombia).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
occasional national survey. This paper utilizes the Special Bogota House-&#13;
hold Survey (EH8E) for 1975 and one from 1977 (EH15). The 1975 survey&#13;
sampled 3,953 households and contains information on demographic and labor&#13;
force characteristics. The 1977 survey was conducted in the four largest&#13;
cities and sampled 6,082 households of whom 3,161 households were in Bogota.&#13;
Both these surveys contain the location of residence of the respondents.&#13;
The 1975 survey also has firm size information on the number of employees&#13;
working in each respondents' work place. This question was not included&#13;
in the 1977 sample.&#13;
In carrying out these samples, DANE classifies neighborhoods&#13;
into six socioeconomic strata: 1 low-low, 2 low, 3 medium low, 4 medium,&#13;
5 medium high and 6 high. At the conclusion of a survey weights are&#13;
assigned to each of these strata which are then applied to the members&#13;
of these strata for all expansions of the sample. These expansion factors&#13;
are supposed to account for over and under sampling that might occur over&#13;
the course of the survey.  These expansion factors are used to expand the&#13;
1977 sample, but none were available for the 1975 sample so that has been&#13;
expanded uniformly for all households. In comparing these samples with&#13;
the 1973 census it appears that the poor areas of the city were somewhat&#13;
undersampled and the rich oversampled (Mohan, 1978). It also appears that&#13;
the very highest incomes were either underreported or undersampled. If&#13;
the incomes reported in these samples are converted to 1973 pesos, there&#13;
is little real growth in incomes, while those in the very highest categories&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
actually decline. We have therefore not deflated incomes from either&#13;
sample to make them directly comparable because such a comparison may&#13;
not be consistent across all income groups in the samples. All incomes&#13;
are reported in current pesos and all incomes are monthly incomes.&#13;
The 1977 sample had the additional problem that about 20%&#13;
of working respondents did not report their incomes - a proportion that&#13;
is atypical for these surveys. Thus a method was derived to impute their&#13;
incomes and this is described in Appendix 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. WHO THEY ARE&#13;
Throughout this paper we have chosen to use the concept of house-&#13;
hold income per capita as the relevant income measure. 1/ A better measure&#13;
would be that of household income per adult equivalent where individuals&#13;
of different ages receive different weights in conformity with their&#13;
shares in consumption. It is difficult, however, to arrive at a satis-&#13;
factory set of weights and there is no general agreement in the literature&#13;
on tL- appropriate weights to be used. Furthermore, weights would be&#13;
different for different income groups since consumption in low income&#13;
groups is dominated by food consumption while it is not for higher income&#13;
groups. We have therefore chosen to weigh individuals equally and have&#13;
used the bottom 30% to comprisethe poor. This cut-off is arbitrary but&#13;
has some basis in relation to the cost of minimum nutritional require-&#13;
ments in Bogota. For 1977 Garcia (1978) calculated 475 pesos per month&#13;
as the minimum cost of subsistence for a person in Bogota and that low&#13;
income households spend close to 80% of their expenditures on food.&#13;
Hence, 594 pesos a month per person emerges as a logical cut-off for the&#13;
poor: we have used 580 pesos per month household income per capita as the&#13;
cut-off and this then includes 30% of the population, that is the bottom&#13;
three deciles.&#13;

fication of this.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

2.1 Income and Family Size: Table 2.1 shows the mean household income&#13;
per capita (HINCAP) by family size for the bottom 30% as well as for the&#13;
top 70%. It is striking that larger households have lower HINCAP than&#13;
smaller households for the top 70% but the situation is opposite for the&#13;
poor. Among the poor HINCAP increases as family size increases. Columns&#13;
7 and 8 give the proportion of households in each size group who fall in&#13;
the bottom 30%. For both the years it is the larger households, those&#13;
with over seven people, who are more likely to fall among the poor.&#13;
It is somewhat surprising that among the poor themselves the&#13;
larger households are somewhat better off. We suspected that this result&#13;
may be caused by the inclusion of zero incomes l/ among the poor. Thus&#13;
smaller households would be more affected by this group where household&#13;
income is more likely to decline to zero when one member is unemployed.&#13;
We therefore repeated the Table 2.1 tabulation after excluding zero&#13;
incomes from the counts. The mean incomes for the small households (1, 2,&#13;
3-4 members) increased substantially but incomes still increased with&#13;
household size. Thus we must conclude that while larger households are&#13;
more likely to be poor, the smaller households who are poor are likely to&#13;
be poorer still.&#13;
Table 2.2 is a rather revealing table showing higher dependency&#13;
ratios characterizing the poor as compared with the rich. For the bottom&#13;
1/ People unemployed, for example, in the reference week, report zero&#13;
incomes and these would be transitory.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
30% (the poor).l/ The average number of people per worker in a household&#13;
is about five while that for the top 70% (the rich) 1/ it is only about&#13;
2.5. This pattern holds across all family sizes. However, the number of&#13;
people per worker is almost constant beyond the family size of five.&#13;
Combining these results with that of the last table we can conclude tha.&#13;
large families are not poor because they have fewer workers: rather&#13;
that the poor tend to have larger families. The fact that among the poor&#13;
themselves larger families are somewhat better off tends to indicate the&#13;
holding together of larger households for insurance purposes. Banding&#13;
together in larger families ensures some income flowing in even when&#13;
one or two members are unemployed.&#13;
Table 2.3 shows the composition of poor and rich by sex: .-&#13;
appears that there is no difference among the two distributions. Wome;.&#13;
are as likely to be poor as the men.&#13;
2.2 Distribution of the Poor by Age and Education Groups&#13;
Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2 give the distribution of the rich&#13;
and poor by age groups and education. They also give the incidence of&#13;
poverty for each group. 2/ As expected, the poor are more heavily&#13;
represented among those with no uiducation and primary education. While&#13;
1/ We will often use the term "bottom 30%" and "the poor" and "top 70%&#13;
and "the rich" interchangeably.&#13;
2/ This index is akin to "The Index of Occupational Specification"&#13;
used by Hoover and Vernon (1962), p. 284. An index over 100 indicates&#13;
"tover-representation" of the poor in that group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
60 to 65% of the poor are those with primary or less education only about&#13;
40 to 45% of the total population (over 12 years of age) falls in that&#13;
category.&#13;
Table 2.4 gives more summary measures of poverty in each age/&#13;
education group. The table gives the proportion in each group falling&#13;
among the bottom 30%. Thus, if poverty was evenly distributed across all&#13;
age and education groups we would expect'30% in each group to fall among&#13;
the bottom 30. The poor are therefore over-represented in all those groups&#13;
with numbers higher than 30. Several interesting results stand out&#13;
from this table. People with no education are highly likely to be poor&#13;
at all ages. Overall, people with primary education are also likely to&#13;
be poor but with different likelihoods at different ages. The effect of&#13;
different stages in the life cycle is very evident here. It appears&#13;
that children under 14, people in their middle ages (35-44) and the&#13;
old (65+) are more likely to be poor. We expect the old to be poor but&#13;
it is surprising to see the poor over-represented among the prime earning&#13;
ages of 35-44. While this effect is particularly evident for people with&#13;
low education it is also evident for people with secondary education.&#13;
Several factors are at work here. First, people complete their household&#13;
formation in this age group so the household is at its peak size during this&#13;
period, thus reducing HINCAP. This should be mitigated by higher incomes&#13;
during this peak earning period. However, as shown in Mohan (1978), people&#13;
with primary and no education have rather flat,earnings profiles: thus the&#13;
same income has to feed more mouths as family size increases until the&#13;
&#13;

children grow up enough to work (usually when parents are in their 40s) and&#13;
we see that older age groups are better off except the very old who are&#13;
presumably largely retired.&#13;
It is worth noting from Table 2.4 that while the poor are heavily&#13;
over-represented among those with low education, as many as 20% of those&#13;
with secondary education have incomes below what is probably necessary for&#13;
minimum nutrition. Furthermore, 11% of even those with some higher educa-&#13;
tion are afflicted with poverty. Some of these are those people who are&#13;
transitorily unemployed but the majority basically do not earn enough.&#13;
2.3 Migrant Status: Convention wisdom has it that recent migrants are&#13;
disproportionately poor, that they work in the "murky sector" while waiting&#13;
for the prize jobs in the organized or formal sector: Table 2.5 presents&#13;
tabulations of the poor according to their length of residence in Bogota.&#13;
It shows that only 15% of the poor are those who have been in Bogota for&#13;
less than five years. The group with largest representation of the poor&#13;
seems to comprise those who have been in Bogota for 11 to 20 years. The&#13;
problem of poverty is clearly therefore not of migrants. It is much more&#13;
true to say that poverty is widespread among all groups. If anything,&#13;
recent migrants appear to be somewhat better at supporting themselves&#13;
and only 20-25% happen to fall in the bottom 30%. The two surveys&#13;
are not in full agreement though the broad patterns are clear. The 1975&#13;
survey shows that 31.3% of all migrants with less than one year of resi-&#13;
dence in Bogota were poor while the 1977 survey shows only 24.6%. The&#13;
pattern is reversed for females. Similarly, the 1977 survey shows a higher&#13;

proportion of the poor with 1 to 5 years of residence. Are these sampling&#13;
artifacts or reflections of reality? We cannot be sure and these data&#13;
indicate the unrealiability of drawing strong conclusions from sample&#13;
surveys without corroboration from other sources.&#13;
These results are in agreement with Helena Jaramilla's (1978)&#13;
careful study of the characteristics of migrants drawn from a 1973 census&#13;
sample for the whole country. She concluded that migrants earn more than&#13;
non-migrants at all education and age levels; that migrants of long standing&#13;
earn more than non-migrants; that migrants born in large cities earn more than&#13;
natives. Mohan (1978) also showed that migrants are also spatially distributed&#13;
around the city tairly uniformly, as are recent migrants. We can thus not&#13;
attribute the existence of poverty in the city to the arrival of masses&#13;
of unskilled migrants in the city who cannot find jobs or are underemployed&#13;
while waiting for better paying jobs to appear. Overall, migrants, recent&#13;
or of long standing, are not very different from natives and, if anything,&#13;
are better off. This is worth emphasizing since poverty is often laid to&#13;
the arrival of poor migrants much like cheap imports are often blamed for&#13;
the existence of unemployment rather than low productivity.&#13;
2.4 Unemployment and Participation Rates Among the Poor&#13;
Unemployment and participation rates will be examined in greater&#13;
detail in a later section of the paper. Here we merely look at the broad&#13;
picture of unemployment and participation rates by income groups. Unem-&#13;
ployment is defined as open unemployment and includes only those who&#13;
said that they were seeking work in the reference week of each survey.&#13;

Table 2.6a gives the decile specific unemployment rates for&#13;
both males and females in 1975 and 1977. The deciles are ranked according&#13;
to HINCAP. Not surprisingly, there are more unemployed among the bottom&#13;
five declines. As many as 30% of all people in the bottom decile are&#13;
unemployed and 11-12% in the second decile. Unemployment rates decline&#13;
as income increases quite regularly for both males and females. The two&#13;
surveys are largely in agreement except for the bottom decile for women.&#13;
Table 2.6b gives the distribution of the unemployed by deciles. Almost&#13;
50% of all males unemployed fall in the bottom 30%. The women unemployed&#13;
are somewhat more evenly distributed and only about 35 to 40% fall among&#13;
the poor. We are left with the question: "Are people unemployed because&#13;
they are poor or are they poor because they are unemployed?" It will be&#13;
addressed partially in a later section by looking at a spatial and age-&#13;
education disaggregation of unemployment rates but here we disaggregate&#13;
the unemployed into primary and secondary workers in Table 2.7. If the&#13;
large proportion of the unemployed who fall in the bottom 30% are poor&#13;
because they are unemployed we would expect the majority of them to be&#13;
primary workers (heads of households). Table 2.7 shows, however, that&#13;
more than half of them are secondary workers. Indeed, the large majority&#13;
of primary workers who are unemployed do fall in the bottom 30%. Even if&#13;
we regard all of them as being transitorily unemployed and not "normally"&#13;
belonging to the bottom 30% we are still left with rates of unemployment&#13;
among the bottom 30% which would be substantially higher than in higher&#13;
deciles. We may therefore conclude that at least some of the unemploy-&#13;
ment among the poor is because they are poor.&#13;

If we now look at participation rates in Table 2.8 the picture&#13;
becomes clearer. Not only do the poor have higher unemployment rates&#13;
they also have substantially lower participation rates. Thus the bottom&#13;
deciles have a substantial proportion of people who are not working in&#13;
one way or another. The rates of participation rise for the men until&#13;
the sixth decile and then flatten out. Female participation rates rise&#13;
regularly until the last decile. Female participation is therefore&#13;
directly related to income. The very low participation rates in the&#13;
bottom decile indicate a certain number of discouraged workers and, per-&#13;
haps, a certain number old, infirm or incapacitated who cannot work and&#13;
are therefore poor.&#13;
We thus emerge with a composite picture. In the bottom decile,&#13;
that is among the very poorest, only about 40 to 50% of males over 12&#13;
years participate in the labor force and only 15% of the women as compared&#13;
with the overall participation rate of about 70% of the men and about 30%&#13;
of the women. Of those who do participate almost 30% are out of work in&#13;
the bottom decile. Consequently, only about 35% of all men over 12 years&#13;
in the bottom decile have jobs and only about 8 to 10% of the women.    Of&#13;
the remainder some must be discouraged workers and others incapacitated&#13;
by age, sickness or injury. Employment generation is therefore only&#13;
partly the answer. Many of the poor are probably unemployable and their&#13;
poverty must be attacked directly.&#13;

III. WHAT THEY DO&#13;
This section attempts to identify the labor force characteristics&#13;
of the poor, that is, of those who work among the poor. Workers here are&#13;
defined as all those who say their primary activity is work and all others&#13;
(students, for example) who work more than 15 hours a week. Once again,&#13;
the poor are those whose household income per capita (HINCAP) falls among&#13;
the bottom 30% regardless of their own wages.&#13;
3.1 The Age and Education Levels of Poor Workers&#13;
Appendix Table A.3 gives the distribution of poor workers by&#13;
age and education groups, and Table A.4 gives a similar distribution for&#13;
all workers. To find out which groups are atypically poor we need to&#13;
compare the two distributions. This is done in Table 3.1. This table&#13;
gives an index of concentration of poverty by age and education groups.&#13;
If poverty was evenly distributed among all age groups within education&#13;
levels all the indices would be 100. The index of concentration reported&#13;
is:&#13;
wi = Proportion of Education Groups i in Age Group i in bottom 30%&#13;
ii  Proportion of Education Group i in Age Group j among all workers&#13;
Thus, for example, if among the bottom 30%, of those male workers who have&#13;
primary education 16.7% fall in the age group 15-24 and the comparable&#13;
proportion for all workers is 20.0%, the index of concentration is 84%.&#13;
The index gives an idea of how likely it is to find the poor in an age&#13;
group within a given education level.&#13;

We have circled the atypically high indices of concentration in&#13;
Table 3.1. Only those groups have been circled where the two surveys are&#13;
in agreement. Among males it is interesting to note that the distribution&#13;
of poor workers is not strikingly different from'that of all workers except&#13;
that they are over-represented in the 35-44 age group. Note that workers&#13;
over 65 are only over-represented among those with no education. There&#13;
are very few among males 12 to 14 years old who are workers and the poor&#13;
are not over-represented in this group - although owing to the small&#13;
sample at this level of aggregation the two samples are not in agreement.&#13;
It is surprising that the poor are not clearly over-represented in this&#13;
group since one would have expected only the very poor to go out to work&#13;
at much earlier ages. It indicates that those who work clearly contribute&#13;
to household income and thus, perhaps, help in lifting the household out&#13;
of poverty. Indeed, the age group 35-44 is atypically poor probably&#13;
because their children are foregoing current income in order to go to&#13;
school. It may be recalled from Section 2.2 that of all children aged&#13;
12 to 14 almost 40% were poor. These data point to the real economic&#13;
hardship undergone by the poor in educating their children even if the&#13;
education were free.&#13;
Among females, the story is similar and the age group 35-44 is&#13;
again atypically poor. In addition, the poor among those with primary or&#13;
less education also predominate in the lower age group of 25-34; old women&#13;
(over 65) with secondary education who have to work are also poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Table 3.2 gives another way of looking at the same data. It&#13;
reports the proportion within each age-education category who fall in&#13;
the bottom 30%. The first point to note is that only about 20% of&#13;
male workers and 15% of female workers fall among the bottom 30. Thus&#13;
it is clear that any type of a job is likely to lift people out of&#13;
poverty. It is surprising that only about 15% of the women who work&#13;
are poor. It is again probably the case that, the majority of women&#13;
being secondary workers, just bringing a second income into a household&#13;
makes that household relatively better off. Half of all workers with&#13;
no education and a third of those with primary education fall in the&#13;
bottom 30. For women the proportions are much less.&#13;
Overall, the picture is clear: of those who work, people&#13;
are poor during their middle age of 35 to 44. If we are really inter-&#13;
ested in the removal of poverty, one direct policy action would be to&#13;
give schooling stipends to poor children. It would have the double&#13;
effect of relieving current poverty for the most hard pressed as well&#13;
as investing in human capital for the future so that future poverty is&#13;
relieved.&#13;
3.2 The Occupation of Poor Workers and the Hours they Work&#13;
This section examines the occupations that poor workers are&#13;
predominantly in and the hours they work in these occupations.&#13;
Table 3.3 gives distribution of the poor and of all workers by&#13;
occupation. As expected, poor workers are largely in blue collar occupa-&#13;
tions: around 70 to 75% of all poor male workers are blue collar workers&#13;

and about 65 to 70% of all female workers. In the overall distribution&#13;
only about 55 to 57% of both male and female workers fall in that category.&#13;
Table 3.3 also gives a poverty index for occupations (as defined in the&#13;
table and similar to other poverty indices in this paper). We have&#13;
circled the occupations which have an over-represention of poor workers.&#13;
These are service workers and production workers of both sexes (not&#13;
including maids), male construction and transport workers and female&#13;
sales workers. These categories cover about 65% of the poor male workers&#13;
and 70% of the poor female workers. Note that maids who comprise about&#13;
20% of the poor female workers are not particularly poor. They are&#13;
relatively better off than their counterparts who work in service and&#13;
manufacturing jobs. The two surveys are in broad agreement in these&#13;
distributions except that there seems to be a problem between the classi-&#13;
fication of sales manager and other sales categories. Many more sales&#13;
people seem to have been classified as sales managers or proprietors&#13;
in 1975.&#13;
Do poor workers work long hours or are they short of work?&#13;
To answer this question we tabulate the distribution of hours worked in&#13;
each occupation by the poor and by all workers and compare the two distri-&#13;
butions. Table 3.4a reports the distribution of hours worked by occupa-&#13;
tion for poor male workers while Table 3.4b gives the same distribution&#13;
for all male workers. In Table 3.4a we have circled the cells where a&#13;
larger proportion of the poor are found in the hours worked category&#13;
as compared with the distribution for all workers. It is striking that&#13;

the poor are over-represented among workers who work long hours. About&#13;
20% of poor male workers work over 60 hours a week while only 15% of&#13;
all male workers work such hours.   Sales workers, construction workers&#13;
and transport workers who are poor appear to work particularly long&#13;
hours.  Among the poor, it is only professional and technical workers who&#13;
work relatively short hours.   Only about 8% of the poor work less than&#13;
40 hours and about 55 to 60% work the "normal" 40 to 48-hour week. Note&#13;
also that sales and transport workers work the longest hours in general.&#13;
The story is somewhat different for female workers. They&#13;
appear to be over-represented among those working shorter hours.&#13;
Table 3.5a gives the distribution for the female poor and Table 3.5b&#13;
for all females. Once again it is the sales workers who work very long&#13;
hours along with the maids. It would seem therefore that, perhaps,&#13;
there are many poor women working part-time who would like more work but&#13;
cannot get any or cannot work longer hours because of responsibilities&#13;
at home.&#13;
The picture we emerge with is therefore a composite one. It&#13;
appears that the poor men are largely not lacking for work: there is&#13;
little overt or open underemployment. Indeed, if anything, the poor&#13;
are overworked in low productivity occupations. The sales workers are&#13;
perhaps actually underemployed, that is, idle for a substantial part of&#13;
their working hours. But they comprise only about 25% of all poor workers. 1/&#13;
1/ See Appendix Tables A.5 and A.6 for Distribution of Hours Worked by&#13;
Occupation (where columns seem to be a hundred) for poor male and&#13;
female workers.&#13;

Almost half of the poor overworked men are transport or construction workers.&#13;
It is unlikely that they are idle during much of their working day. On the&#13;
other hand, a substantial portion of the women are either genuinely&#13;
underemployed (i.e., willing and able to work more hours) or unable to&#13;
work longer hours. Poverty will therefore not be alleviated by more&#13;
expansion of employment opportunities. For men what is needed are higher&#13;
productivity employment opportunities, and this may imply the provision&#13;
of training programs for the least skilled and overworked. For women,&#13;
perhaps, more employment opportunities are needed along with day care&#13;
programs so that they can participate in income producing activities.&#13;
Note that the provision of day care is itself an employment generating&#13;
activity.&#13;
The last tabulation of poor workers according to their occu-&#13;
pational distribution is Table 3.6 which gives the proportion of workers&#13;
earning less than the minimum wage in each occupation.   The proportion in&#13;
the two surveys are somewhat different: in 1975 17.6% of male workers&#13;
and 21.8% of female workers earned less than the minimum wage while in&#13;
1977 only 6.8% and 15.3% respectively earned less. The 1975 survey&#13;
was conducted shortly before the next increase in minimum wage and the&#13;
1977 one was conducted soon after a minimum wage increase to adjust for&#13;
inflation. The comparative position of the occupations is, however,&#13;
not affected by these discrepancies. Recall that 20 to 23% of male&#13;
workers fall among the bottom 30% and about 15% of female workers.&#13;

If the bottom 30% indeed fall below the minimum adequate nutrition&#13;
requirement this would indicate that the minimum wage should be raised&#13;
somewhat to make it possible for workers to achieve at least the minimum&#13;
nutritional standards for themselves and their families. Clearly, if the&#13;
minimum wage is raised the demand for labor would decline resulting in&#13;
higher unemployment. But workers can scarcely be expected to work at&#13;
adequate productivity levels without the barest of minimum nutrition.&#13;
Indeed, if productivity is raised by raising the minimum wage it can have&#13;
an employment generating effect in the long run, through the normal&#13;
multiplier of increased incomes.&#13;
Among males it is large proportions of sales workers and&#13;
construction workers who are paid less than the minimum wage. Recall&#13;
that they were also over-represented among those who work long hours.&#13;
Once again we can speculate that the sales workers fall among the&#13;
disguised underemployed but the construction workers do not. Among&#13;
women it is noteworthy that a very small percentage of maids are paid&#13;
below minimum wages. It is mainly female sales service and production&#13;
workers who are paid below the minimum wage rates. Note that on the whole&#13;
for more women work for below minimum wage levels but recall that many of&#13;
them also work part-time.&#13;

Table 3.7 gives the distribution of the poor and of all workers&#13;
by industry of activity. Once again poverty indices have been calculated&#13;
to show which activities have an over-representation of poor workers.&#13;
In correspondence with the fact that blue collar workers are more likely&#13;
to be poor, this table shows that secondary activities, that is manu-&#13;
facturing and construction, are more likely to have poor male workers&#13;
employed in them. Within manufacturing, lumber and wood products and&#13;
mineral production appear to be the industries employing an atypical&#13;
proportion of poor workers. The 1977 survey also points to food products,&#13;
beverages and tobacco as employing poor workers but this is not borne&#13;
out by the 1975 sample. Among tertiary activities, retail trade, trans-&#13;
port and communication and personal and domestic services stand out as&#13;
activities employing a large proportion of poor people. About 40% of&#13;
the bottom 30% men are employed in these activities.&#13;
For females the picture is similar but with some differences.&#13;
Within secondary activites, poor women are disproportionately employed&#13;
in textiles and shoes, lumber and wood industries and in printing and&#13;
publishing. About 16 to 18% of poor women are employed in these indus-&#13;
tries as opposed to about 12% in the overall distribution. Within&#13;
tertiary activities the poor women are overly represented in retail trade&#13;
and in other commerce. Once again, personal and domestic services do not&#13;
employ a disproportionate number of poor women.&#13;
Table 3.8a and 3.8b give the distribution of hours worked by&#13;
industry. 1/ of activity for poor men and all men respectively. We&#13;
;j The column distributions for poor men and women is given in Tables&#13;
A.7 and A.8 respectively.&#13;

follow a similar procedure as for occupations and compare the distri-&#13;
butions in Table 3.8a with those in Table 3.8b. More poor men work&#13;
longer hours than shorter hours. Twentyfive to thirty percent of poor&#13;
men who work in food products and in textiles and footwear work over&#13;
60 hours a week. Within tertiary activities, 35% of poor men work over&#13;
60 hours in retail trade and in transport and communication.&#13;
Tables 3.9a and 3.9b report similar distributions for poor&#13;
women and all women respectively. In corroboration of the results for&#13;
occupations, poor women are over-represented in part-time work in&#13;
trading activities and in personal and domestic activities where they&#13;
are likely to be underemployed. About 40% of poor women who work in the&#13;
manufacture of food products and beverages, however, work atypically&#13;
long hours.&#13;
These tables merely corroborate the information given for&#13;
occupation and provide no surprises. They are included mainly for com-&#13;
pleteness.&#13;
The last tabulations of poor workers by activity of industry are&#13;
the proportions of workers earning less than minimum wage and are reported&#13;
in Table 3.10. Once again there are no surprises - mere corroboration.&#13;
Among males employed in secondary activities a disproportionate number&#13;
in lumber and wood and in construction earn less than the minimum wage.&#13;
Others among the poor earning low wages are in trade and commerce and&#13;
personal and domestic services. Between them these activities account&#13;

3.4.  Migrarit Status:  It is often alleged  that recent migrants earn less&#13;
than others and have to take up very low paying jobs while waiting for better&#13;
paid opportunities to appear. The evidence to support this claim is mixed.&#13;
Table 3.11 reports for 1975 the proportion of workers earning less than the&#13;
minimum wage according to years of residence in Bogota. 22 percent of the&#13;
most recent arrivals among men seem to earn less than the minimum wage as&#13;
compared with 17.6 percent over all. However, among those who have been in&#13;
Bogota for 11-20 years, as many as 20 percent earn less than the minimum&#13;
wage. These data really indicate that those earning low wages are fairly&#13;
evenly spread among workers of all vintages and any experience in the city&#13;
does not appear to count for much.&#13;
For women the evidence is strong that a smaller proportion of&#13;
recent migrants earn less than the minimum wage as compared with others&#13;
who have lived in Bogota longer. It is difficult to explain why this&#13;
should be so and the answer perhaps lies in the large number of maids who&#13;
are recent migrants. While maids are not particularly well off it has been&#13;
shown consistently in this paper that a large proportion of them are not&#13;
among the poorest. The income in kind that they receive probably accounts&#13;
for this result. Table 3.12 shows that in 1975 only about 9 percent of the&#13;
maids fell among the poor. What is remarkable, however, is that of the poor&#13;
5-7 percent had some secondary education.&#13;
On the whole, it is clear that recent migrants have no monopoly&#13;
on poverty: indeed, 60-70 percent of all earning below minimum wages have&#13;
been in Bogota for over 10 years.&#13;

3.5. Size of Firm: It is widely believed that workers in small firms&#13;
earn less than those in larger firms but there is often not adequate data&#13;
to support this claim. Size of firm is also often used as one of the key&#13;
criteria for defining the informal sector. Table 3.13 reports the mean&#13;
income of male and female workers by size class of firm where the respondent&#13;
was employed. This table supports the view that smaller firms employ poorer&#13;
workers. The mean income of workers in firms employing over 25 people is&#13;
just about double those with just one employee. The ascent for women is,&#13;
however, not as great, with the highest income class being only one and a&#13;
half times as much as the mean income for female employees in small firms.&#13;
The question in size of firm was asked in the 1975 survey but not, unfor-&#13;
tunately, in the 1977 survey. The quality of these data is somewhat&#13;
questionable since about 40 percent of all workers did not respond to this&#13;
question (Table 3.14). Furthermore, the non responses had a much lower&#13;
mean income than the respondees. If a substantial proportion of these&#13;
belonged to large firms, the results without them would be biased. The rate&#13;
of non response was greater for the bottom 30 percent where only about half&#13;
of the people gave information on their size of firm. Table 3.14 shows that&#13;
the poor are well distributed over size classes of firms also, although as&#13;
many as 30 percent of the bottom 30 percent who responded worked in single&#13;
employee, presumably as   'lf-emplo"edLr establishments.&#13;

IV. WHERE THEY LIVE&#13;
4.1. The Spatial Disaggregation of Bogota&#13;
Maps 1 and 2 show a ring and radial sector representation of the&#13;
map of Bogota. The basic socio-economic spatial unit in Bogota is a "barrio"&#13;
or neighborhood of which there were about 500 in 1973 and about 700 now as&#13;
a result of the rapid growth of the city. DANE geo-codes this unit in a&#13;
4-digit number of which the first 2 digits identify a comuna--a collection&#13;
of barrios. The last 2 digits then identify barrios within a comuna. The&#13;
basic unit that we have used for analysis is a comuna of which there were&#13;
1/&#13;
38 in 1973.   For convenience of exposition we have aggregated these comunas&#13;
into "rings" and "sectors" as shown in the maps. The boundaries of the&#13;
comunas shown in the maps are principal streets in Bogota. The city is&#13;
bounded in the East by mountains and, therefore, has an approximately semi-&#13;
circular shape, although it is longer going from North to South, as is&#13;
evident from the maps. We have numbered the rings from 1 to 6 going outwards&#13;
from the centre of the city and sectors 1 to 8 going clockwise also starting&#13;
from the centre of the city. Ring 1 and Sector 1 are identical and comprise&#13;
the Central Business District (C.B.D.)&#13;
4.2. The Spatial Distribution of the Poor: Mohan (1978) documented the&#13;
distribution of people in Bogota by incomes and showed largely that the poor&#13;
are concentrated in the South and rich in the North with various gradations&#13;
in between. Here we take another look at the spatial distribution of the&#13;
poor--first by rings and then by sectors.&#13;
1/ See Mohan (1978) for some comuna level distributions for the city.&#13;

Table 4.1 shows the distribution of the poor by rings. Unfortunately,&#13;
the two samples are not in close agreement in the distribution of the poor.&#13;
What is unmistakable, however, is that as we proceed outwards from the centre,&#13;
first the incomes of people increase on the average and then decrease. The&#13;
1975 sample shows a relatively heavy concentration of the poor in the two&#13;
centre rings. The trend is similar in the 1977 sample,but not as pronounced.&#13;
Relatively fewer people seem to have been sampled from the C.B.D. in 1975.&#13;
We have calculated the familiar indices of concentration: the 1977 sample&#13;
indicates the two inner rings as poor and the 1975 sample the two outer rings.&#13;
Rings 4 and 5 contain the majority of the population as well as of the poor.&#13;
The C.B.D. is interesting since it has a high mean income in both samples as&#13;
well as a high proportion of people (about 35 percent) in the bottom 30 percent.&#13;
We may conclude that as far as rings are concerned, the poor are everywhere&#13;
and each ring has around 30 percent of its population in the bottom 30 percent.&#13;
The pattern is somewhat more pronounced when looked at over radial&#13;
sectors, as shown in Table 4.2. Roughly, mean income increase as we go&#13;
clockwise from sector 2 to sector 8 (except for sector 6 which has a low&#13;
income as well). The sectoral distributions are also not in complete agreement&#13;
between the two samples but sectors 2 and 3 are clearly the poorest. They&#13;
both have low mean incomes as well as a relatively large proportion of the poor.&#13;
Between them they account for 52 to 55 percent of the poor and about 40 to&#13;
45 percent of the total population. The greatest discrepancy between the&#13;
two samples is in sector 8. In the 1975 sample, almost 30 percent of the&#13;
people in this, the richest sector fell among the bottom 30 percent while&#13;
in the 1977 sample the proportion is only 16.4 percent. The latter is nearer&#13;

the census proportion and therefore somewhat more accurate. However, this&#13;
is yet another pointer to the problem of using sample surveys for drawing&#13;
strong conclusions about spatial distributions and about time trends.&#13;
4.3. The Spatial Distribution of Poor Workers:&#13;
Tables 4.3a and b give the distribution of poor workers by rings.&#13;
There appears to be greater agreement between the two samples on the residence&#13;
characteristics of poor workers, as distinct from poor people. The C.B.D.&#13;
has an atypically high proportion of poor women living there and the outer&#13;
two rings have an atypically high proportion of poor men. Not only does the&#13;
C.B.D. have a higher proportion of poor women but the poor women there seem.&#13;
to have the lowest average income by far among the poorest. Tables 5.4a and&#13;
5.4b give the distribution of workers by radial sector and the pattern&#13;
corroborates that found for poor people. Sectors 2 and 3 account for 50-55&#13;
percent of all poor workers. Once again, sector 8 has a large discrepancy&#13;
between the two samples. The index of concentration for the 1975 sample is&#13;
101 and for the 1977 sample 35. Clearly, the 1975 sample seems to have over-&#13;
sampled poor workers within sector 8 and undersampled the rich workers since&#13;
the 1977 sample was shown to be in broad agreement with the 1977 census in&#13;
Mohan (1978).&#13;

V. THOSE WHO DO NOT WORK: UNEMPLOYMENT AND PARTICIPATION RATES OF THE POOR&#13;
In section 2 we showed that unemployment was particularly high&#13;
among the poor and is therefore regarded as one of the key causes as well&#13;
as results of poverty. In this section we attempt to disaggregate the&#13;
unemployment and participation rates somewhat more by age and education&#13;
groups and then spatially by sectors.&#13;
5.1 Rates of Unemployment and Participation by Age and Education Groups&#13;
Table 5.1 and 5.2 report the unemployment and participation rates,&#13;
respectively, of the bottom 30 and top 70 percent of the people, disaggregated&#13;
by levels of education. The rates of unemployment are much higher for the&#13;
poor at all educational levels. For males, while for the overall population&#13;
or for the top 70 percent, people with higher education have the lowest un-&#13;
employment rates, among the poor they have the highest. Indeed, in general,&#13;
for both poor males and females, the higher the level of education the larger&#13;
the difference between the unemployment rates of the poor and rich. It would&#13;
seem that those among the poor who "make it" and receive more education&#13;
have greater trouble finding jobs as compared with those with less education.&#13;
This story is corroborated by pattern of the rates of participation. It&#13;
is striking that among the poor the rates of participation are the lowest&#13;
among those who have higher education followed by secondary and primary&#13;
levels. In the overall distribution those with secondary education have&#13;
lower participation rates than others but this is mainly caused by the low&#13;
rates for the 15-24 age group (see Table A.10). The causation here is&#13;
difficult ',to follow but it is probably a combination' of two kinds of phenomena.&#13;
There is probably one set of people who are poor because they are going to school,&#13;
&#13;

not participating in the labor force and therefore existing on low incomes.&#13;
The extremely low rates of participation suggest that there is probably&#13;
another group consisting of discouraged workers who have withdrawn from&#13;
the labor force after having been unemployed for a long period of time.&#13;
There is evidence that, of all the unemployed, about half have been unem-&#13;
ployed for over 3 months: that some graduate on to being discouraged&#13;
workers is therefore not an unreasonable supposition.&#13;
Tables 5.3 and 5.4 report the unemployment and participation rates&#13;
of the poor and rich disaggregated by age groups. While among the rich&#13;
unemployment is high only for the young, for the poor it is high for both&#13;
the young and the old. Among the poor over 12 percent of the age group 45-54&#13;
are unemployed. For females, there are discrepancies between the two surveys&#13;
so the same pattern cannot be verified: these older unemployed are spread&#13;
over all the education groups though relatively more concentrated among the&#13;
lower education levels. In getting unemployed at that age, it is presumably&#13;
difficult for these people to find jobs easily and some probably have to&#13;
retire early and spend the rest of their lives in poverty. This conjecture&#13;
is supported by the data reported in Table 5.4. The difference in participa-&#13;
tion rates between the poor and rich is more pronounced at older ages. People&#13;
with low education withdraw from the labor force relatively early and, moreover,&#13;
after having had rather flat age-earnings profiles. Policy measures to&#13;
relieve poverty among this group have to be direct: either direct provision&#13;
of employment for which they are qualified or direct welfare measures. It is&#13;
quite likely that these early retirees have always been poor and consequently&#13;
retire early for health reasons.&#13;

5.2 Where Are the Unemployed?&#13;
The spatial disaggregation of unemployment rates helps in approaching&#13;
the question "Are the unemployed poor because they are unemployed or&#13;
unemployed because they are poor?" Table 5.5 and 5.6 disaggregate unemploy-&#13;
ment rates by sectors for education groups and age groups respectively. For&#13;
males, the unemployment rates are somewhat even:y distributed except that&#13;
the two poorest sectors 2 and 3 have higher rates and the two richest sectors,&#13;
7 and 8 have somewhat lower rates. In particular, sector 2 stands out with&#13;
high rates and sector 8 with the lowest. Furthermore, it is striking that&#13;
unemployment is particularly high for people with higher education in sector 2&#13;
indicating the difficulty that poor highly educated people have in getting&#13;
jobs and, perhaps, suggesting some kind of labor market segmentation discri-&#13;
minating against the poor--sector 2 being the poorest sector. Sector 2 has&#13;
higher unemployment levels at all age levels as well and sector 8 the lowest.&#13;
Compared to the others, sector 2 has a particularly high rate of unemployed&#13;
among older people reinforcing the conjectures made about discouraged workers&#13;
and retired workers that were made in the last section.&#13;
Tables 5.7 and 5.8 report the spatial disaggregation of participa-&#13;
tion rates by education and age groups respectively. Participation rates&#13;
appear to be evely distributed among the sectors: though the richer sectors have&#13;
somewhat lower participation rates because of larger numbers of years spent&#13;
in education; and women in poorer sectors appear to have marginally lower&#13;
participation rates. Similarly the participation rates by age groups appear&#13;
to be evenlydistributed.  Poorer sectors have overall higher participation&#13;
rates because people enter the labor force at lower ages. As suggested&#13;

earlier at higher ages the poorer sectors have lower rates of participation&#13;
because of earlier withdrawal from the labor force.&#13;
Overall, there is some support for the idea that a component of&#13;
the unemployment is reinforced because people are poor. Poverty leads to&#13;
malnutrition, disability which makes people unemployable as well as disollusion&#13;
which leads to withdrawal froa the labor force.&#13;

APPENDIX 1&#13;
A TECHNICAL NOTE ON THE CALCULATION OF INCOMES&#13;
DANE- household surveys are now conducted quarterly in the four&#13;
largest cities (Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla) and in the seven&#13;
largest alternatingly, mainly to study urban employment and unemployment&#13;
and the characteristics of the labor force. Characteristically incomes are&#13;
reported in the following manner:&#13;
1. For Employees (of all kinds): (a) Cash income from employment&#13;
ia reported according to periodicity of payment which has 5 categories:&#13;
monthly, fortnightly, every 10 days, weekly and daily. The multiple used&#13;
to ronvert there incomes into monthly equivalents were as follows:&#13;
monthly -                          1&#13;
fortnightly (quincenal) -          2&#13;
ten days -                         3.04  (365 x 1 )&#13;
1.0   12&#13;
weekly -                           4.33   (52/12)&#13;
daily -                            21,75&#13;
This method obvicusly overstates income for those workers who&#13;
are paid at less than a month's periodicity and do not work the whole&#13;
month. However, less than 5% of the workers report that they are paid daily&#13;
(where error is most likely) so the overall effect of this computation is&#13;
not likely to be unreasonable. (b) Value of income received in kind (food,&#13;
shelter, clothing) is reported separately. Total labor income was then&#13;
computed for employees as the sum of (a) and (b).&#13;
2. Employers and Self Employed: The question asked is "Net&#13;
earnings last month from job." This was interpreted as labor income although&#13;
that IR not strictl!  correct for the sclf cmployed.&#13;
3. All: Income sources other than employment which are categorized&#13;
as interest, rents, pensions, cash aid and other were assumed to comprise&#13;
1/ Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica. (The Colombian&#13;
Statistical Office).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
each individual's non-labor income.&#13;
Consequently, each individual reporting any income had 2 types&#13;
of income: labor income and non-labor income.&#13;
4. No Information: A large proportion of the sample - about 20% -&#13;
did not report their incomes but did give all other characteristics. They&#13;
could not be omitted from the sample because they were not uniformly&#13;
distributed over the sample but were concentrated among sales workers and&#13;
sales managers and proprietors - as might be expected. The method used for&#13;
imputing income was similar to the method used by the U.S. Census Bureau.&#13;
The objective is to impute incomes such that the new distribution retains&#13;
the 'true" mean and variance values.&#13;
As the file was read a 19 x 4 x 4 matrix was created with the&#13;
following dimensions:&#13;
- Workers were classified - as employees and self employed by sex&#13;
and 3 categories of place of residence which yields 12 groups.&#13;
- Male employers were classified by the 3 categories of place of&#13;
residence which yields 3 additional groups.&#13;
- Female employers constituted one group and domestic servants from&#13;
the three residence categories formed the remaining 3 groups to form a&#13;
total of 19 groups.&#13;
- Four categoreis of years of education (0), (1-5), (6-11), (12+)&#13;
were used and 4 categories of years of experience (0-1), (2-4), (5-9) and&#13;
(10+0) were used.&#13;
Each cell of the resulting 19 x 4 x 4 matrix then contained&#13;
the income of the most recently read record with these characteristics.&#13;
The records with missing income were then given the income of the most&#13;
recently read record with the same characteristics.&#13;
The rationale behind this procedure may be seen as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a - 70-&#13;
Consider the distribution f (ytlxt;B) which is the estimated&#13;
distribution of incomes yt of individuals given their vector of characteristics&#13;
xt, the estimated vector of parameters being 6. Such a distribution may&#13;
be estimated from the set of individuals with known incomes and characteristics&#13;
which will give 8.&#13;
The procedure described above approximates imputing income tothe&#13;
non-respondents by a random drawing from the above distribution estimated&#13;
from the set of individuals with known incomes from the sample. If n&#13;
drawings were made n = 1, 2, ..., then the average    Yt,n ' ln    ti&#13;
i=l&#13;
could be used as the predictor.   But  Ytn  b Yt as n      'IO&#13;
where  yt =  E [ y t  xt;@].  Thus, the expected value of incomes generated&#13;
by the method used (method 1) is the same as that that would be generated by&#13;
method (2) where the non-resp6ndents 'have imputed incomes Riven hv&#13;
Yt =E [y t xt;t]-&#13;
This would be the result if income equations were estimated and&#13;
then used to impute incomes to the non-respondents.    Method (1), results&#13;
in greater variance than method (2). Method (2) gives the Best Linear&#13;
Unbiased Estimator for the missing incomes but in giving the non-respondents&#13;
with characteristics xt, the mean income of respondents with characteristics&#13;
xt, the effect is a reduction in variance of the overall sample: an&#13;
undesirable result where we are interested in retaining both the central&#13;
value and dispersion characteristics of the parent sample.-/&#13;
Another way of interpreting this method is to view it as utilizing&#13;
extra "non-economic" variables which would not normally be captured in a&#13;
standard human capital type predictive equation.&#13;
The result is that all individuals who work now have incomes&#13;
1/ I am indebted to Michael Hartley for clarifying my thoughts on this&#13;
issue though he should not be implicated with my interpretation of&#13;
the U.S. census method used here to impute incomes.&#13;

except the non-renumerated family workers who have zero incomes.&#13;
5. Household Income: Hrcisehold income was aggregated from its&#13;
constituents' labor and non-labor incomes but care was taken to exclude&#13;
live-in domestic servants' incomes from the aggregation.&#13;

            The poor of Bogota : who they are, what
            they do, and where they live
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The composition and characteristics of
            the poor in Bogota, Colombia are examined in order to
            identify the correlates of poverty. The poor are defined as
            those who fall in the bottom 30 percent of household income
            per capita, a figure that indicates the number of
            malnourished as well. The findings reveal that, although
            larger households are more likely to be poor, the smaller
            households are generally poorer by comparison. People with
            lower levels of education are more likely to be more but the
            better educated are not excluded. The poor have higher rates
            of unemployment at all levels of education. In addition, the
            poor who do have higher education appear to have low
            participation rates, a fact that supports the discouraged
            worker hypothesis, as well as high unemployment. Thus, it
            seems that the poor have difficulty getting jobs regardless
            of qualifications. Spatially, the poor tend to be
            concentrated in the South of the city but represented
            throughout. Numerous statistical tables and technical notes
            on the calculation of income are appended.
