&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX 1&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of each Contribution Agreement&#13;
entered into between the World Bank as Trustee, acting not for its own account, but solely in its&#13;
capacity as trustee of the Trust Fund for the Transition Fund, and each Donor with respect to its&#13;
respective Contribution to the Trust Fund.&#13;
1.     Role of the Trustee&#13;
1.1    The Trustee will be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in&#13;
the Contribution Agreements and Financial Procedures Agreements and will not be subject to any&#13;
other duties or responsibilities to the Donors, ISAs or Transition Countries, including, without&#13;
limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under&#13;
general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in the Contribution Agreements or the&#13;
Financial Procedures Agreements will be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of&#13;
the World Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly&#13;
reserved.&#13;
2.     Receipt of Contributions&#13;
2.1    Contributions to the Trust Fund may be received from donor countries, as specified in the&#13;
Operations Manual, that enter into a Contribution Agreement with the Trustee (each a Donor),&#13;
consistent with the Trustee's policies and procedures and the Contribution Agreements.&#13;
2.2    Contributions will be provided to the Trustee for deposit into the Trust Fund in the&#13;
currency stated in the Contribution Agreement or an amendment thereto. With respect to each&#13;
Contribution, funds provided to the Trustee in a currency other than the Holding Currency will be&#13;
promptly converted by the Trustee to the Holding Currency.&#13;
2.3    Donors may make Contributions to the Trust Fund by means of payment in cash or, with&#13;
agreement of the Trustee, by the delivery to the Trustee of instruments payable on demand or&#13;
similar obligations in a form acceptable to the Trustee. Contributions may be paid in one lump&#13;
sum or in installments on the terms agreed with the Trustee and specified in the respective&#13;
Contribution Agreement.&#13;
3.     Administration of Contributions&#13;
3.1    The Trustee will account for Contributions as a single trust fund and keep them separate&#13;
and apart from the funds of the World Bank. The Contributions may be commingled with other&#13;
trust fund assets maintained by the World Bank.&#13;
3.2    The Contributions may be freely exchanged by the Trustee into other currencies to&#13;
facilitate operations.&#13;
3.3    The World Bank will invest and reinvest the funds in the Trust Fund pending their transfer&#13;
in accordance with the World Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust&#13;
funds administered by the World Bank. The Trustee will deposit all income from such investment&#13;
in the Trust Fund to be used for the purposes of the Trust Fund.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.4    Funds may be approved by the Steering Committee only to the extent funds are available in&#13;
the Trust Fund, meaning throughout the Contribution Agreements available cash and promissory&#13;
notes net of any funds already allocated but not yet disbursed, as determined by the Trustee.&#13;
Subject to the availability of cash and investments held in the Trust Fund as determined by the&#13;
Trustee, the Trustee will commit, transfer or use such funds for any purpose approved and in the&#13;
amounts allocated by the Steering Committee in accordance with the terms of the Contribution&#13;
Agreements and the Financial Procedures Agreements.&#13;
3.5    Upon the transfer of funds from the Trust Fund to an ISA or the Coordination Unit, the&#13;
Trustee will have no responsibility, fiduciary or otherwise, for the use of such funds or activities&#13;
carried out therewith. The Donors acknowledge and agree that the Trustee will transfer funds&#13;
without requiring pre- or post-fund transfer review by the Trustee of any funding proposals&#13;
submitted to the Steering Committee or any activities implemented thereunder.&#13;
4.     Costs of the Trustee and Coordination Unit&#13;
4.1    Costs incurred by the Trustee and the Coordination Unit will at all times be covered in&#13;
their entirety by the Trust Fund. For the purposes of funding such costs, the Trustee and the&#13;
Coordination Unit will submit to the Steering Committee annual Budgets. The first annual Budget&#13;
will include reimbursement for costs incurred prior to Budget approval. Upon approval by the&#13;
Steering Committee of any Budget proposal from the Trustee or Coordination Unit, the Trustee&#13;
may transfer to the Trustee or the Coordination Unit, as the case may be, the respective amount&#13;
approved. The Donors acknowledge and agree that any Trustee or Coordination Unit Budget&#13;
amounts approved by the Steering Committee will be adjusted as necessary at the end of each&#13;
Fiscal Year based on actual costs incurred for activities performed in accordance with the Trustee's&#13;
and the Coordination Unit's respective roles and responsibilities. To the extent actual costs&#13;
incurred are lower than the transferred Budget amount, funds will be returned for deposit in the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
5.     Use of Funds&#13;
5.1    Funds from the Trust Fund may be used by ISAs for Projects and by the Trustee and&#13;
Coordination Unit for Budgets, in each case in accordance with the purposes approved by the&#13;
Steering Committee and in accordance with the Operations Manual.&#13;
6.     Records and Reporting&#13;
6.1    The Trustee will maintain separate records and ledger accounts with respect to the funds in&#13;
the Transition Fund and transfers made therefrom. The Trustee will maintain books, records,&#13;
documents, and other evidence in accordance with the Trustee's usual accounting procedures to&#13;
substantiate the management of funds in the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.2    The Trustee will report to the Steering Committee semi-annually on the financial status of&#13;
the Transition Fund, including information on the status of Contributions, investment income,&#13;
commitments, transfers and funds available for allocation by the Steering Committee.&#13;
6.3    The Trustee will provide to the Donors, within six (6) months following the end of each&#13;
Fiscal Year, an annual single audit report, comprising (i) a management assertion together with an&#13;
attestation from the World Bank's external auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control&#13;
over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the World Bank's external auditors'&#13;
opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit will be borne by the World Bank.&#13;
6.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, an audit of the financial statements&#13;
of the Trust Fund by the World Bank's external auditors, the Donor may seek such audit through&#13;
the Steering Committee. If the Steering Committee agrees to request such an audit, the Steering&#13;
Committee will designate one of its members to act on the Steering Committee's behalf for the&#13;
specific purpose. The designated representative and the World Bank will first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary, in which case the World Bank and the designated&#13;
representative will agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following&#13;
agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the World Bank will arrange for such external&#13;
audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the World Bank with respect to&#13;
such audit, will be borne by the requesting Donor, unless the Steering Committee agrees to instruct&#13;
the Trustee to pay the costs of any such audit from available funds in the Trust Fund. In the event&#13;
the Steering Committee does not agree to request such an audit, and the Donor has a statutory,&#13;
regulatory or policy environment requiring such Donor's ability to make such a request&#13;
unilaterally, such Donor may proceed in lieu of the designated representative as specified above.&#13;
6.5    The Donors acknowledge and agree that the provision of any financial statements and&#13;
progress reports from ISAs is the responsibility of the respective ISA.&#13;
7.     Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Donors and the Trustee, in coordination with the Steering Committee and the&#13;
Coordination Unit, as applicable, agree to make every effort to settle amicably, by way of&#13;
consultation and other remedies as set out below, any dispute or controversy arising out of or&#13;
relating to the Contribution Agreements.&#13;
7.2    To the extent feasible, any dispute or controversy between a Donor and an ISA under a&#13;
Financial Procedures Agreement with respect to ISA Funds will, in the first instance, be resolved&#13;
amicably directly between the Steering Committee and the ISA without requiring involvement of&#13;
the Trustee or individual Donors. The Donors agree that they may collectively through the&#13;
Steering Committee, as undertaken by one of its members specifically designated to act on the&#13;
Steering Committee's behalf for the specific purpose, address to the ISA a request to settle&#13;
amicably such dispute or controversy with respect to any breach of a Financial Procedures&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
7.3   In the event a request to settle amicably a dispute or controversy is not approved by the&#13;
Steering Committee under Section 7.2 in a manner satisfactory to a requesting Donor, and the&#13;
requesting Donor has a statutory, regulatory or policy environment requiring such Donor's ability&#13;
to make such a request unilaterally, such Donor may address a request for amicable settlement, in&#13;
accordance with the terms and in the manner provided for in this Contribution Agreement, directly&#13;
to the ISA.&#13;
7.4    Each Donor will be considered an interested party under each Financial Procedures&#13;
Agreement and will have the option to address a request to the respective ISA to settle amicably, in&#13;
accordance with the terms and in the manner provided for in the respective Financial Procedures&#13;
Agreement, a dispute or controversy regarding any breach by the ISA thereof, whether for itself&#13;
under Section 7.3 or on behalf of the Steering Committee under Section 7.2.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿8.     End Dates and Termination&#13;
8.1   It is expected that no new Projects will be approved by the Steering Committee after the&#13;
End Approval Date and no new transfers to ISAs will be made from the Trust Fund after the End&#13;
Transfer Date. The Trustee may transfer funds after the End Transfer Date only with the approval&#13;
of the Steering Committee.&#13;
8.2    Any Donor may, upon 90 days' advance written notice, cancel all or part of its Donor&#13;
Share as calculated at the end of the notice period. In the event of such cancellation, the Trustee&#13;
will return to such Donor the amount of its Donor Share by transferring the funds directly to (i)&#13;
such Donor, (ii) such Donor's donor balance account held by the World Bank or (iii) another trust&#13;
fund administered by the World Bank, as instructed in writing by the Donor Contact.&#13;
8.3    The Trustee may terminate its role as Trustee of the Trust Fund for the Transition Fund at&#13;
any time after providing the Steering Committee, all the Donors and all the ISAs 90 days' advance&#13;
notice in writing. Following termination, the Trustee will carry on no business for the Transition&#13;
Fund except for the purpose of winding up its affairs. The Trustee will, in consultation with the&#13;
Steering Committee and the IFI Coordination Platform, take all necessary action for winding up its&#13;
affairs in an expeditious manner.&#13;
8.4    Following the date when all funds committed by the Trustee have been fully transferred,&#13;
the Trustee will return to each Donor the amount of its respective Donor Share by transferring the&#13;
funds directly to (i) such Donor, (ii) such Donor's donor balance account held by the World Bank&#13;
or (iii) another trust fund administered by the World Bank, as instructed in writing by the Donor&#13;
Contact.&#13;
9.     Disclosure&#13;
9.1    The World Bank may disclose the Contribution Agreements and information on the&#13;
Transition Fund in accordance with the World Bank's policy on access to information in effect at&#13;
the time of such disclosure. By agreeing to these terms, each Donor consents to such disclosure of&#13;
its Contribution Agreement and such information. This provision will continue in full force and&#13;
effect following completion of all Trust Fund transfers or termination of the Trust Fund.&#13;
