            Many Asian, African and Eastern European
            countries freeing up their electricity markets are
            preserving an artificial monopoly over the wholesale trading
            of electricity even after the vertically integrated national
            power company is unbundled. Evidence so far suggests that
            this single buyer model has major disadvantages in
            developing countries: it invites corruption, weakens payment
            discipline, and imposes contingent liabilities on the
            government. These disadvantages in most cases overshadow the
            higher short-term costs of a bilateral contracts model where
            generators contract with customers.
