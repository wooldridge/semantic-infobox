Republic of Sierra Leone&#13;
INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of Sierra Leone, in its effort to improve the health of its people, has&#13;
requested IDA assistance of SDR 13.6 million (US$20 million equivalent) to finance a Credit&#13;
aimed at supporting the Government's reform of the health sector based on its National Health&#13;
Action Plan (NHAP).&#13;
1.2    With an annual GNP/per capita of only US$150 (1993), Sierra Leone is classified as&#13;
one of the poorest and "least-developed" countries in the world. After negligible growth in the&#13;
1970s, the economic situation sharply deteriorated in the 1980s, coinciding with the Bank's&#13;
five-year suspension of activities in the country. By 1990, over two-thirds of the population&#13;
lived in absolute poverty, a situation exacerbated by the influx of refugees from Liberia and,&#13;
more recently, the displacement of large segments of the population due to rebel attacks on&#13;
mining sites and small towns (see Box 1). Although measures taken by Government,&#13;
particularly during the last months, seem to bear positive results, the future remains difficult to&#13;
predict, and the country is faced with new economic problems such as inflation caused by the&#13;
decline of export revenue, particularly of rutile and diamond mining industry. This situation&#13;
is being compounded by the fact that social services and human resources have been largely&#13;
neglected during the past decade. At present, the infrastructure in the social sector has&#13;
deteriorated significantly because of the absence of maintenance systems, the erosion of public&#13;
sector management and underfunding.&#13;
1.3   Faced with limited resources, the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL), with assistance&#13;
from the Bank and the IMF, embarked on an ambitious structural adjustment program in late&#13;
1989, aimed at economic stabilization and creation of conditions for sustained economic&#13;
growth and reduction of poverty. As stated in its Policy Framework Paper, increased public&#13;
investment in social sectors, particularly for basic education and health care, is a central part of&#13;
the GOSL adjustment program and development strategy. Substantial progress had been made&#13;
in achieving macroeconomic and fiscal management targets: growth rates are recovering, and&#13;
inflation, which reached a peak of 170 percent in 1986-87, stabilized at around 15 percent in&#13;
1993-94. Since the resurgence of rebel activities, macroeconomic performance has begun to&#13;
suffer as a result of decreasing revenues from the productive areas of the country, and&#13;
deviations of public expenditures, largely for military purposes. Government has maintained&#13;
its fiscal commitments to the health sector, though without external support to implement its&#13;
proposed plan, it will be difficult to maintain these efforts in the medium term. Rehabilitation&#13;
of social infrastructure has begun with the resumption of donor assistance and IDA project&#13;
activities, yet there remains an enormous challenge to assure the provision of basic social&#13;
services and to develop the institutional capacity needed to maintain them. The proposed&#13;
investment credit would help the Government's sector reforms lay the foundation for a&#13;
sustainable, equitable and efficient health system, while addressing the new demands&#13;
exacerbated by the rebel activities.&#13;
&#13;

significantly to high mortality. Life expectancy,    Aid workers have relocated to Freetown, and&#13;
after improving during the 1 960s and 1 970s,        most development efforts outside Freetown&#13;

specify a political or military agenda, though&#13;

assessment of the Government's commitment&#13;
2.2      The nutritional situation has changed       to end the war. To date, the outcomes of&#13;
little over the last decade. In 1978, a national     these measures look promising but not yet&#13;

years were underweight; the most recent estimate in 1989-90 showed a prevalence of 33.4%&#13;
in the same age group. The data show similar trends for stunting and wasting. The daily&#13;
supply of calories is only about 1,800 - less than 80% of estimated requirements; about the&#13;
Department of Health figures differ, estimating the population to 4.2 million and life expectancy at 43 years and 45&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
same level as ten years ago. Micronutrient deficiencies are also common. For example, iron-&#13;
deficiency anemia is found in about two-thirds of pregnant women and nearly 60% of all&#13;
children. Among other causes, this can be attributed to chronic or recurrent illness (especially&#13;
malaria), worm infestation, poor feeding practices (e.g. late addition of supplemental foods for&#13;
infants), and short birth spacing.&#13;
2.3     There are a number of factors contributing to the poor levels of health status&#13;
indicators in Sierra Leone. There is a high burden of disease exposure due to crowded and&#13;
unsanitary living conditions. For example, less than half the population has access to safe&#13;
drinking water or sanitation facilities, with conditions being much worse in rural areas. Too&#13;
many children, spaced too closely, by mothers that are too young, increase health risks to&#13;
mothers and their children. Extremely low levels of literacy and basic education leave many&#13;
people ignorant about good health practices, limit the ability of women to make healthy&#13;
choices for their families, and perpetuate the cycle of poverty and illness. These are&#13;
aggravated by the social disruption and disorganization that has afflicted Sierra Leone.&#13;
Traditional practices and cultural norms also may impose additional health risks or may limit&#13;
access to modem health care.&#13;
B. CURRENT STATE OF THE HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
2.4     According to the Government, health services have "reached an appalling state of&#13;
deterioration both in quality and scope" (NHAP). Because of this, health care services are&#13;
doing little to respond to the huge health needs of the population. A lack of sustained political&#13;
will, grossly inadequate funding, and the near absence of responsibility and accountability&#13;
within the health sector in the past contributed to the breakdown in public services. The&#13;
private sector has compensated to a small degree for failings of the public system, but most&#13;
private services are inaccessible to the majority of the population and are of variable quality.&#13;
Organization of the health care system&#13;
2.5     Health care is provided through a network of about 550 primary, secondary, and&#13;
tertiary government health facilities, and another 35 hospitals and 84 clinics operated by the&#13;
mission and private sectors (see Annex 4). There are two main types of public facilities, as&#13;
outlined below.&#13;
(a)   Peripheral Health Units (PHUs). Over 500 PHUs are supposed to provide&#13;
primary health care services: predominantly antenatal care, family planning,&#13;
immunizations, and simple curative care. There are currently three types of PHUs&#13;
which differ, at least in concept, by the level of staffing, equipment, and the size of the&#13;
communities in which they serve. In order of decreasing size, these PHUs are located&#13;
at chiefdom headquarters (Community Health Centers, catchment population of 10,000&#13;
- 20,000), small towns (Community Health Posts, catchment population of 5,000), and&#13;
village level (Maternal and Child Health Posts). The latter facilities may not be formal&#13;
clinics, as they are often based in the homes of local health workers (MCH Aides).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
(b)   Hospitals. There are 24 public hospitals currently open, which mostly provide&#13;
the services of a first referral hospital. The Govemment defines hospitals with less&#13;
than 40 beds as secondary care facilities, and larger hospitals as tertiary care facilities.&#13;
The larger hospitals are usually located in major towns (e.g. provincial headquarters)&#13;
and are supposed to have more specialized curative care services. Connaught hospital&#13;
in Freetown is the main referral hospital in the country.&#13;
2.6     Prior to the sector reforms of 1994, the organizational structure of the Department of&#13;
Health (DOH) was convoluted, and inconsistent with the health care delivery system. Health&#13;
activities in the DOH were separated between "clinical" and "public health" services, and there&#13;
was no clear responsibility for or authority over health service delivery. There was very little&#13;
sharing of information or coordination of the different "programs" that existed, partly because&#13;
of a lack of joint planning and the separate funding arrangements with different donors. The&#13;
headquarters of the DOH did not have a single executive head, and the administrative authority&#13;
was divided between the Permanent Secretary and the Chief Medical Officer, who handled&#13;
nearly all paperwork and decisions in the DOH. The vast majority of decisions regarding&#13;
budgets, expenditures, appointments, discipline and pay were still referred to other Central&#13;
Government Departments. In the DOH, the major services needed to operate a Government&#13;
Department, such as those for budgeting, accounting, personnel and management information&#13;
were at best extensions of Central Departments, with little autonomy, capacity, or direction&#13;
from the DOH.&#13;
2.7     Below the headquarters level, the Provincial management tier is being eliminated,&#13;
opening up a direct link between headquarters and the district level (there are 12 rural districts&#13;
and 2 administrative divisions in Western Area-Freetown). A District Medical Officer (usually&#13;
a "public health" physician) heads the district management team, and the district hospital is&#13;
usually headed by another District Medical Officer (a "clinical" physician). The district team&#13;
is responsible for both primary and secondary care facilities, but in practice, hospital planning&#13;
and management have been quite separate from other district health activities. District teams&#13;
lack the management structures and authority to plan, make expenditures, or monitor health&#13;
services in their districts. Few district teams provide training, supervision or other support to&#13;
their PHUs, much less interface with their communities in a meaningful manner. For example,&#13;
community health or development committees are rarely functional. There is no effective&#13;
referral system, and hospitals spend much of their resources providing primary curative care.&#13;
Many of the services that are to be delivered at PHUs are being done poorly, and some&#13;
services, in particular health education, family planning, and community nutrition, are&#13;
frequently not delivered at all.&#13;
Status of health facilities&#13;
2.8     Except for a few projects earmarked by donors, specific data on the physical status on&#13;
most health facilities are not yet available. The physical state of most hospitals and clinics is&#13;
deplorable, since virtually no attention has been paid to maintenance and repairs in decade&#13;
preceding 1992. Basic infrastructure (water, electrical power, and access roads) is often&#13;
lacking. Furthermore, in a 1994 DOH/WHO survey of district health care, it was determined&#13;
that there are not enough PHUs, and also noted that many of the clinics that were expected to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
exist were no longer in operation. There was no functional ambulance or communications&#13;
systems to connect PHUs to hospitals until 1994, when a small ambulance service was started.&#13;
Although the situation has improved in the last two years, shortages of essential drugs&#13;
(including contraceptives and vaccines), medical equipment, and supplies are commonplace,&#13;
seriously undermining the capability of facilities to deliver services.&#13;
Health personnel&#13;
2.9     The 1994 DOH/WHO survey of district health care revealed that there are wide&#13;
variations in the numbers and levels of qualified staff in PHUs. In general, health personnel&#13;
are unevenly distributed, inadequately trained, badly supervised, poorly supported, and under-&#13;
compensated. Consequently, staff performance is poor and morale is low. It is estimated that&#13;
currently nearly two-thirds of all health personnel are deployed in hospitals, including all&#13;
clinical doctors in the public sector. To establish the basis for forward looking manpower&#13;
planning, the DOH has initiated the set up of a manpower database to monitor the actual&#13;
numbers of health personnel, their qualifications, and location (see Annex 4 for the estimated&#13;
distribution of health personnel). In its preliminary estimates, the NHAP indicated that there&#13;
are major shortages of community health workers, pharmacy technicians, nurses, midwives,&#13;
and doctors. At the same time, the DOH has been hampered with a large number of daily&#13;
wage earners, which has consumed much of the wage bill and prevented the recruitment of&#13;
much needed health staff. By mid-1991, more than half of the DOH's staff consisted of daily&#13;
wage workers (6,100). Since then, however, the number of daily workers has been reduced to&#13;
under 2,200, and the number of staff given temporary appointments has dropped by 27 percent&#13;
(see Figure 2.1).&#13;
2.10    In the past, training of health workers has been inconsistent, and has suffered from&#13;
chronic under-funding, ad hoc development of training programs, out-dated and redundant&#13;
curricula, and poor competing local training institutions. Government recognized these&#13;
problems and, despite prevailing constraints, developed well-designed training programs for&#13;
MCH Aides and other mid-level staff as well as a physician training program. As part of its&#13;
new manpower plan, the DOH has decided to rationalize the composition and training of&#13;
health workers according to the types of skills needed at various levels of the health system.&#13;
The implementation of this plan is part of the NHAP core program.&#13;
Health financing&#13;
2.11  During the past decade, the health sector has been grossly under-funded. In FY90/91,&#13;
the share of health expenditures in the total Government expenditures was about 2 percent, and&#13;
the share of the recurrent health expenditures in the total Government recurrent expenditures&#13;
was about 2.8 percent, both in sharp decline as compared to the previous years, e.g., in&#13;
1980/81, these shares were 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively. This situation is gradually&#13;
being reversed under the current structural adjustment program. As a result, in FY95/96 the&#13;
health sector's share in the total Government's expenditures increased to about 6 percent (see&#13;
Figure 2.2). In real terms (constant 1986/87 Le), health expenditures per capita increased from&#13;
about Le2O in FY90/91 to Le33 in FY 95/96, and as a share of GDP, the public sector's health&#13;
budget increased from 0.4 percent to about 1 percent over the same period (see Annex 5). The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Government, at the Social Sector Consultation with donors and NGOs in October 1995,&#13;
reiterated its commitment to further increase the financial allocation to the health sector.&#13;
Although this might be hampered by slow economic growth and a high population growth rate,&#13;
it appears reasonable to attempt to maintain, or slightly increase, the share of financial&#13;
resources allocated to the health sector at the current level of more than 6 percent of the&#13;
Government budget (not including public debt service). In US Dollar terms, per capita&#13;
expenditures for health in the public sector in 1995/1996 amounted to approximately $3.1&#13;
($1.5 contributed by GOSL and $1.6 by donors). Based on the household survey conducted in&#13;
1989/1990, it can also be estimated that some other $4 were spent by the population in the&#13;
private formal and informal health sector. Under the new project, the Government's allocation&#13;
for the provision of health services in FY 1996 will amount to approximately $2.1 per capita,&#13;
while donor assistance to the health sector from bilateral and multilateral sources, as well as&#13;
from NGOs, will exceed current Government contribution, and will amount to approximately&#13;
$3.2 per capita. This will represent an increase of funding to the public health services of&#13;
about 70%.&#13;

2.12    Government financed development expenditures in the health sector were negligible&#13;
during since the beginning of the 1990s. The only notable exception has been the&#13;
establishment of a new College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences in 1988, financed as&#13;
an educational institution from funds allocated to the Department of Education. A proposal to&#13;
build a new tertiary hospital near Freetown has been on the drawing board for nearly 10 years.&#13;
However, in the process of setting the priorities for the NHAP, Goverinment has made a&#13;
conscious and commendable decision to postpone the building of a tertiary care hospital and to&#13;
concentrate its infrastructure development efforts on primary health care and on rehabilitating&#13;
existing facilities.&#13;

* Budget Allocation&#13;
2.13      Since the inception of its health sector reform, the DOH has achieved a stunning turn-&#13;
around in the economic composition of its recurrent expenditures by reducing the share of&#13;
personnel expenditures and, conversely, increasing the share for other operating expenditures.&#13;
In 1992/93, the DOH used more than 63 percent of all recurrent expenditures for salary and&#13;
wage related expenses. This share has been reduced, within two years, to only 30 percent in&#13;
1994/95 (see figure 2.3). The underlying basis for this change has been the above mentioned&#13;
reduction in DOH staff, in particular of daily wage workers (see para. 2.9), and the increase of&#13;
the budgetary allocations to the health sector. Indications are that this change has impacted&#13;
positively on service delivery, improving the funding for critical recurrent expenditures such as&#13;
drugs, contraceptives, supplies, maintenance and repair, while the laid-off staff - consisting of&#13;
either "ghost workers" or of relatively inefficient custodial and clerical workers - hardly&#13;
contributed to service delivery.&#13;

2.14     While this is a remarkable success, unprecedented in any other West African country,&#13;
personnel expenditures remain distorted towards hospital services: it is&#13;
estimated that 27% of personnel expenditures are paid to PHU workers, 72% to hospital&#13;
workers, and the remainder to central DOH staff. Non-personnel recurrent costs also show a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
hospital bias; 19% of these expenditures went to PHC services, and 53% went to hospitals, the&#13;
remainder to central DOH operations. Salaries are still severely distorted, so that a physician&#13;
entering Govemment service receives virtually the same gross pay as a low-skilled daily&#13;
worker doing menial cleaning. However, physicians and other health providers supplement&#13;
illegally their incomes through charging additional fees, allegedly enabling some of them to&#13;
eam ten times their official salaries. Other health workers often demand two to four times the&#13;
amount of their official salaries to augment their incomes. In January 1995, an ad-hoc&#13;
committee has been set up with support from WHO to assess the situation and to coordinate&#13;
health care financing issues, initially focusing on tertiary level hospitals.&#13;
2.15 User fees for drugs and services were commonly applied in public facilities. However,&#13;
during the last years, the sharp increase in the number of displaced people and the declining&#13;
economy have impoverished a large proportion of the population. The government was&#13;
therefore forced, in 1994, to temporarily suspend cost recovery for drugs and, to a large part,&#13;
the collection of user fees for services.&#13;
C. PREVIOUS BANK OPERATIONS IN THE HEALTH SECTOR AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.16    The resumption in 1992 of project activities under the Health and Population Project&#13;
(CR 1695-SL) has demonstrated the severe institutional weakness of the DOH. A limited&#13;
number of very capable staff are over-stretched with responsibilities, and there are few&#13;
functioning management systems to support them. While much of 1992-93 was needed to re-&#13;
establish the project, with increased supervision and technical assistance, project performance&#13;
has progressively improved. The project is expected to fully disburse its funds by the closing&#13;
date at the end of 1995. The experience reinforces the need for an investment operation that&#13;
concentrates on human resource development and the establishment of management systems.&#13;
It also suggests that health system investment requires a long-term commitment to effect&#13;
sustainable change. Lessons from two World Bank studies have been instrumental in the&#13;
development of the program. The World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health was&#13;
used as a resource in the prioritization of activities, particularly to identify the more cost-&#13;
effective services. The comprehensive review of African experience, Better Health in Africa,&#13;
outlines processes for change in health policy and strategy development, government&#13;
commitment and collaboration with the private sector, cost-effective approaches to the delivery&#13;
of care, managerial development and institutional reform, and donor support to a single&#13;
country reform program. These have all been adopted by the Government of Sierra Leone in&#13;
the development of the NHAP. The program is thus becoming an example of how to apply the&#13;
Better Health in Africa study.&#13;
D. DONOR ASSISTANCE IN THE SECTOR&#13;
2.17    There is a wide number of donors involved in the Sierra Leone health sector, whose&#13;
activities have increased over the last ten years as the public system's needs have increased.&#13;
The main bilateral donors have included France, Germany, the United States, the United&#13;
Kingdom, and others, while the multilateral agencies have included, African Development&#13;
Bank, IDA, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO. The number of non-governmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
organizations (NGOs) has also increased, and includes AFRICARE, CARE, Christian Children&#13;
Fund, Christian Health Association of Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone Muslim Mission, Plan&#13;
International, Plan Parenthood Association, Sierra Leone Red Cross, Marie Stopes and others.&#13;
Many agencies are involved in emergency relief operations for refugees and war victims, the&#13;
largest of which is the World Food Program. Otherwise, the main activities have included&#13;
support for maternal child health and family planning, hospital services, and various&#13;
preventive programs. The total amount of external assistance in the health sector was&#13;
estimated at US$8.4 million in 1992 (see Annex 5). By comparison, donor assistance for the&#13;
entire period from 1989 to 1992 amounted to US$38.5 million. Most donors have bypassed&#13;
Government structures as much as possible in the planning and implementation of their&#13;
programs, largely because of the limited administrative and operational capacity and lack of&#13;
accountability in the Government system, and the need to achieve short term performance&#13;
criteria by which project implementation is usually judged. The lack of coordination among&#13;
participants in the health sector has led to a fractionated health system. At one point in 1994,&#13;
the DOH estimated that it had at least 47 different "project implementing units" aligned with&#13;
the various donors. The failure of such a divisive approach is one of the major reasons that&#13;
Government and donors have opted for an integrated sector-wide approach. Implementation of&#13;
the NHAP provides the means for the DOH to develop as a Department of Health rather than a&#13;
Depot for Health Projects; the DOH will become the true coordinator of the sector and guide&#13;
donor efforts, rather than the other way around.&#13;
E. KEY ISSUES&#13;
2.18    The security situation has been a central concern for the health sector in recent years,&#13;
and has taken up much of the energy of the DOH and other health agencies (see Box 2). One&#13;
of the functions of a health system is to respond to emergency needs caused by man-made&#13;
crisis or natural disasters. Government has taken the position that emergency responses and&#13;
rehabilitation efforts will be wasted in Sierra Leone unless underlying reform in the health&#13;
sector also takes place. In this respect, the Government's program addresses four underlying&#13;
problems of the health sector.&#13;
Poor access to health care&#13;
2.19    Physical access is limited by the insufficient number of functional health facilities to&#13;
serve the vast majority of the population who live in rural areas. Only about 65% of the&#13;
population live within a 10 km radius of a health facility, and the proportion is lower in the&#13;
Northern and Southern Provinces. Many of the facilities provide poor quality services, due to&#13;
lack of diagnostic equipment, drugs, contraceptives, vaccines and supplies, or because of a lack&#13;
of qualified and motivated staff. Inadequate knowledge about the need for health care, high&#13;
fees charged by health workers, and the poor quality of care also diminish the access to and the&#13;
use of health care services, particularly for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Box 2 The Effects of the Security Crisis on the Health Sector&#13;
The deteriorating security situation has put additional strain on an already weakened public health system. Nearly all health&#13;
personnel in the most affected districts (4 out of 13) have been moved to larger towns, a number of public and private hospitals&#13;
andi clinics have closed, and the provision of health services in these districts have been disrupted severely. Supply and logistic&#13;
support to district hospitals and PHUs have been hampered. At the same time, the large scale movement of the population has&#13;
caused increased demand for health services in the remaining districts not affected by the conflict, particularly in Freetown and&#13;
the Westem Area.&#13;
Despite the ongoing strife, the DOH is conducting more district outreach activities than in 1992, even after the events of&#13;
January, 1995. Partly because of the influx of refugees, and also because of the improved quality of care, utilization of health&#13;
seivices in Freetown and other urban areas appears to have increased in the last years. In the last month, some of the drugs and&#13;
supplies that were planned for peripheral distribution are being used to meet the emergency needs of refugees in Freetown. As&#13;
the security situation improves, they will be distributed to peripheral clinics and hospitals as necessary.&#13;
The current uncertainty about the security situation has affected much of the physical planning for the health sector. There is&#13;
mutch need for repair and retooling of clinics and hospitals throughout the country. However, these activities will now need to&#13;
belin in the Westem Area and the safe districts until security is completely restored in the outlying areas. Much of the ongoing&#13;
and1 planned training activities in the health sector will be able to continue, though the development and upgrading of some&#13;
support systems may well have to be delayed or phased in because of the uncertainty in the countryside. For example, the&#13;
development of better cost-recovery systems for drugs will probably need to be delayed as Govermment is planning to subsidize&#13;
drugs for hospitalized refugees and displaced persons.&#13;
The management of the DOH has reacted flexibly and quickly to the current crisis. Even more remarkable is that while under&#13;
this increased strain, the DOH has mustered the energy and taken major steps to reform the health system. The security crisis&#13;
haa put additional pressure on the Govemment's budget by reducing income and increasing military expenditures.&#13;
Nevertheless, the DOH was able to maintain the support of central Govemment, and allocations for the health sector actually&#13;
increased for the FY1995/1996.&#13;
The uncertainty caused by the deteriorating security situation has increased the need for a comprehensive and flexible approach.&#13;
The sector-wide approach and the implementation and monitoring modalities require that each year's financing is based on&#13;
review of past performance and a plan for the coming year approved by IDA. This will allow maximum flexibility for&#13;
Gcvernment and donors to begin the upgrading of the health system in the most safe areas, and to react quickly to any changes&#13;
in he security situation. To restore the provision of quality health care in the district - as soon as the security situation allows -&#13;
wil be a necessary precondition for the return of the rual population, and for the recovery of agricultural production, and thus&#13;
improvement of the prospects for a lasting peace in the country.&#13;
Poor quality of services&#13;
2.20     There are a number of immediate factors which contribute to poor quality of care, in&#13;
addition to the basic problems of under-funding of health services and poor management.&#13;
Anong them, insufficient attention to in-service training and to supportive supervision of&#13;
health workers is a major factor, particularly for those in the outreach, such as MCH aides,&#13;
community health officers, and other mid-level staff.&#13;
Poor management, with inadequate community involvement and accountability&#13;
2.21      This situation is partly a result of insufficient training, a lack of investment in&#13;
management systems such as management information, and an organizational structure that is&#13;
highly centralized and dominated by a power culture where decisions are not linked to the&#13;
level of operations. This has led to a disconnection between peripheral and central levels of&#13;
health care delivery, inadequate planning, and an inability to regulate the defacto parallel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
private health care system. The lack of community involvement is partly due to insufficient&#13;
attention to this matter by an administration currently confronted with war and low economic&#13;
performance, no clear accountability of health providers to the communities they serve,&#13;
insufficient skills in community relations and development, and the absence of incentives for&#13;
health workers to involve communities.&#13;
Insufricient financing and misallocation of scarce resources&#13;
2.22   There has been inadequate fumding for critical support programs such as maintenance&#13;
and essential drugs systems, resulting in physical decay of health facilities, shortages of drugs,&#13;
and loss of confidence in public sector health services. The use of the scarce resources has been&#13;
biased to urban, hospital based curative care, at the expense of more cost-effective primary&#13;
curative and preventive measures aimed at those most at risk. There was a heavy payroll with a&#13;
large proportion going to daily wage workers who contributed little to the sector, while most&#13;
health professionals are paid well below a living wage, forcing many to take on other jobs or&#13;
charge patients extra fees. To improve financial management, Government has introduced -&#13;
beginning FY 94/95 - a program budgeting system to better match resources with stated priority&#13;
programs and activities; and it is also in the process of establishing a comprehensive accounting&#13;
system which would more closely monitor the appropriate allocation of financial resources.&#13;
III. THE HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY&#13;
A. THE GOVERNMENT REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
3.1    As part of its structural adjustment program, the Government of Sierra Leone is&#13;
demonstrating a greater commitment to reforming the health sector by increasing the share of&#13;
its resources allocated to health, though public expenditures on health are yet to reach the 1980&#13;
levels. Following the change in Government in April 1992, the Government began a series of&#13;
public discussions on the problems of the health sector. This led to the development of a&#13;
National Health Policy in 1993, which outlined its main intentions for reform in terms of&#13;
improving the health of its population through comprehensive and systemic reform. Again,&#13;
using widespread consultation, a National Health Action Plan (NHAP) was developed in 1994&#13;
to provide the framework for health sector reform, and outline its overall costs. Since then, the&#13;
DOH has undertaken a series of steps to further advance their reforms, including a public&#13;
information campaign about the NHAP, an assessment of health services and priorities from&#13;
the viewpoint of beneficiaries, a prioritization exercise to develop a core program of the&#13;
NHAP, a reorganization of the DOH based on a institutional self-assessment, a comprehensive&#13;
manpower plan, and a financial management plan. The DOH is also developing procedures&#13;
for district health planning, and has begun the formulation of operational plans by the new&#13;
units of the DOH and the districts. It has outlined its plan for infrastructure investment, and is&#13;
further studying its financing options for the health sector.&#13;
3.2    In the National Health Policy, the Government declares its intention to seek economic&#13;
growth and social justice by improving the quality and distribution of services, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
health care. The National Health Policy states that the focus of efforts in health care will be on&#13;
the development of preventive services, while strengthening the existing delivery system. The&#13;
main agenda for Government as described in the National Health Policy is that:&#13;
(a)  a network of sound primary, secondary, and tertiary health facilities will be&#13;
strengthened through rehabilitation, appropriate staffing and logistical support;&#13;
(b)  environmental health and communicable disease control will be promoted;&#13;
(c)  community participation and intersectoral cooperation will be fostered;&#13;
(d) health care delivery will be decentralized to the district level;&#13;
(e)  Government financing of health care will increase;&#13;
(f)  certain services will be privatized, where appropriate; and&#13;
(g) cooperation with international agencies and NGOs will be promoted.&#13;
3.3    The NHAP builds on the National Health Policy by providing a framework for health&#13;
sector actions, and proposes systematic improvement in the delivery of priority health services&#13;
and the support services that maintain them. The NHAP was developed through a participative&#13;
workshop involving a wide variety of stakeholders using an adaptation of the ZOPP&#13;
(objectives oriented project planning) methodology developed by the German technical&#13;
assistance agency (GTZ). This resulted in an unconstrained "total" program costing about&#13;
US$270 million over five years, and an agreed set of criteria for prioritization: (a) need; (b)&#13;
cost-effectiveness; (c) cultural acceptability; (d) operational feasibility; and (e) equity&#13;
promotion. A series of highly participative consultations were used to analyze the total&#13;
program according to these criteria (see para. 4.3, and Box 3). Given the anticipated limitations&#13;
on financing, the central planning team applied the findings on priorities to the total program,&#13;
to end up with a core program costing about US$138 million, comprising the most essential&#13;
elements of the sector plan which need to be financed before other elements of the program.&#13;
The core program of the NHAP is intended to guide sector activities for the next five years and&#13;
provide a focal point for donor assistance. It is the basis for the sector investment credit.&#13;
3.4    The process of reform has done much to energize the Department of Health, district&#13;
staff and the people associated with it. DOH staff have learned to work in teams to identify&#13;
and solve problems, and therefore communication and the effectiveness of the work of the&#13;
DOH has improved. The reform process has brought Department staff much closer to the&#13;
users of the health system and to other providers. This is one of the main reasons why the&#13;
DOH was selected Government's most productive Department (see Box 4).&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.5    There are compelling reasons for IDA to continue to support the Government's&#13;
reform initiatives in the health sector which started with assistance from a first project, i.e.,&#13;
Health and Population Project, which will be closed at the end of 1995: (a) the Bank has&#13;
invested heavily in sector work to promote health system reform (notably the above-&#13;
mentioned, 1993 World Development Report and Better Health in Africa) to foster rational&#13;
priority setting and selection of cost-effective interventions. The sector reform process in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Sierra Leone follows the same objectives and will benefit from IDA financial and technical&#13;
support; (b) the policy and type of program developed in Sierra Leone, and the agreement with&#13;
donors and NGOs makes possible a more comprehensive and integrated approach to which the&#13;
Bank is committed and which will ensure a sustainable development impact; (c) the health&#13;
system in Sierra Leone has deteriorated to such an extent that there is a large financial and&#13;
technical gap between what is currently available (and provided by Govemment, donors and&#13;
NGOs) and what is needed to begin making the health system work in Sierra Leone; (d) at this&#13;
point in time, IDA is in a decisive position. Its contribution as a donor of last resort, filling&#13;
the gap after other donors have adjusted their support to meet specific requirements and&#13;
restrictions, will enable the Government to address the basic health needs of a very poor&#13;
population, carry out a fundamental sector reform, and help the economic and societal&#13;
recovery.&#13;
Box 3 Stakeholders Set Priorities&#13;
At the first Bintumani conference in November, 1993, a large group of health professionals, officials and other&#13;
interested parties was charged with outlining a National Health Action Plan, based on recently developed&#13;
National Health Policy. The result was an ideal health program estimated to cost over $270 million for the next&#13;
5 years. The participants recognized that the draft NHAP was not a program that could be feasibly financed or&#13;
implemented at this time, so they worked out a set of criteria to choose priorities. The main criteria were: (a)&#13;
need; (b) cost-effectiveness; (c) cultural acceptability; (d) operational feasibility; and (e) equity promotion. An&#13;
external consultant was hired to operationalize these criteria, to help the DOH choose among the nearly 60 main&#13;
activities outlined in the draft National Health Action Plan.&#13;
A number of tools were used for priority setting, including structured interviews with officials in various&#13;
Government Departments and non-governmental organizations; a written survey for DOH staff from all levels;&#13;
focus group meetings with opinion leaders from key groups, such as with women's organizations, health&#13;
providers, and health care consumers; and town meetings with 150 male and female chiefs located throughout&#13;
the country. At each stage, the results were discussed with the participants. A detailed beneficiary assessment&#13;
was also conducted by Department staff and local consultants, to obtain in-depth feedback on priorities and&#13;
concerns about health care. A central team of DOH staff went through an exercise to use this information,&#13;
along with data on cost-effectiveness of interventions from the World Development Report, to rank the priority&#13;
programs and activities. These results were then systematically applied against the first draft of the NHAP to&#13;
determine the most essential services and activities.&#13;
The core program of the NHAP that resulted from this exercise cost around one half the original NHAP, and&#13;
included activities for incremental financing. The most critical programs identified were in the areas of&#13;
primary health care, particularly for maternal and child health, clean water and sanitation, and health education.&#13;
Difficult decisions were also made to freeze public investment on tertiary care. Equally important is the&#13;
consultative processes that were established within Government, between Goverunent and the public, and with&#13;
other health agencies. As a result, there is a great deal of public support for the health reforms, and a high level&#13;
of ownership and enthusiasm within Govermnent for the NHAP.&#13;
C. BANK ROLE IN THE HEALTH REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
3.6      In response to a Govemment request, the Bank has assisted the Government in&#13;
promoting the sector-wide investment approach among the donors and has been a key partner&#13;
in the Government's efforts to design its reform program. Through a Japanese PHRD Grant,&#13;
IDA has helped Government with much of the technical preparatory work and consensus-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
building for the NHAP and the development of the core program. IDA has supported the&#13;
assessment and reorganization of the DOH and its training programs, and has provided&#13;
technical assistance in design and facilitation of the planning, budgeting, and prioritization&#13;
processes. This has included a formal beneficiary assessment, the development of health&#13;
planning tools, a human resources plan, and design of its technical and support programs,&#13;
(such as nutrition, health information and education, essential drugs and contraceptives,&#13;
laboratory services, maintenance and repair services), and support to strengthen sector&#13;
financial management. Last, but not least, IDA-together with the other donors and NGOs-&#13;
participated actively in the social sectors consultations held in 1994 and 1995, and supported&#13;
DOH to become a true coordinator of the donor community in both health and education&#13;
sectors.&#13;
D. FUTURE DONOR SUPPORT FOR THE HEALTH REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
3.7 In 1993 Government launched its new policy for the sector and declared that its main&#13;
goals were improvement in social conditions and poverty alleviation, along with sustained&#13;
economic growth, which were reflected in its Public Investment Program (PIP). A&#13;
Consultative Group (CG) meeting held in March, 1994, was carried out to serve as a vehicle to&#13;
bring the needs of Sierra Leone before the donor community and encourage donor support to&#13;
the human resources sectors (Health, Education, and Poverty Alleviation). The CG was&#13;
followed by two Social Sectors Round Tables in May, 1994, and in October 1995, to mobilize&#13;
external assistance and coordinate donor interventions around the core program of the NHAP.&#13;
The donor and NGO community responded with full endorsement of the NHAP and the&#13;
integrated sector approach, as described in the Communiques of the Round Table Meetings&#13;
(Annex 6). Aside from IDA, donors made pledges for over US$55 million in support of the&#13;
core program of the NHAP, with additional support for technical assistance. The donors&#13;
offering support include the Africa Development Bank, the European Union, the Islamic&#13;
Development Bank, the Saudi Fund for Development, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO,&#13;
with potential for additional donor assistance. As agreed at the Round Table Meetings, the&#13;
Government would play the lead role in coordination, and would commit to regularly (i.)&#13;
discuss with donors and NGOs sector plans and budgets, and (ii.) jointly review their&#13;
implementation.&#13;

IV. THE PROGRAM&#13;
A. PROGRAM SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1    The proposed IDA Credit would support the Government's NHAP core program, with&#13;
the intention of improving the health status of the people of Sierra Leone by increasing access&#13;
to and improving the quality of a basic package of health services that would be better&#13;
managed and delivered through an increasingly decentralized system. In the prioritization&#13;
exercise which led to the definition of the NHAP core program, the DOH identified the&#13;
following general development objectives: (i) improve key health status indicators; (ii)&#13;
increase access to health care and family planning, particularly in the rural areas; (iii) improve&#13;
the quality of service through training, supervision and improved logistic support; (iv)&#13;
strengthen management, accountability and community involvement at central and peripheral&#13;
levels, and; (v) increase efficiency and improve the financing for health care. The NHAP core&#13;
program also identifies the following program priorities: (a) improve child health; (b) improve&#13;
maternal health; (c) reduce fertility; (d) reduce the incidence and prevalence of communicable&#13;
diseases and other common ailments, including HIV; (e) reduce mental illness; (f) reduce&#13;
injury and handicaps; (g) assure satisfactory nutritional status; (h) reduce drug abuse; (i)&#13;
improve living conditions; and (j) improve food hygiene. Specific indicators to monitor&#13;
progress in the achievement of these objectives have been developed and will be used during&#13;
supervision. Successfully laying the foundation for a sustainable, equitable and efficient health&#13;
system will also contribute to the attainment of more general societal goals, such as social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
sustainability of the adjustment program, improvement of prospects for a lasting peace in the&#13;
country, and the strengthening of the human resource base needed for a sustainable economic&#13;
development.&#13;
4.2    The credit is designed as an integrated sector investment operation, such as the&#13;
transport sector projects in Tanzania and Mozambique, and the credits approved to the health&#13;
sector of Bangladesh and, more recently, of Pakistan and Zambia. Government has taken the&#13;
lead to design a common framework for action in the entire sector, under which IDA and other&#13;
donors will provide support. The credit thus supports Government in its continual&#13;
development of policy and on-going operations, even as reforms and rehabilitation proceed.&#13;
The number of reforms needed are vast, and often there are no clear-cut answers to the&#13;
problems they seek to address. The changes will require considerable financial and technical&#13;
support for in-country testing and discussion, requiring maximum flexibility in the type of&#13;
support needed by Government. Accordingly, the specific items for financing will be&#13;
identified throughout implementation of the NHAP, based on regular review, re-planning and&#13;
client consultation.&#13;
4.3    Priorities. The prioritization of health needs and services has been a major part of&#13;
the preparation process, leading to the definition of the core program from an initial&#13;
description of a total or desired sector program. As discussed above, a comprehensive&#13;
approach was used to develop priorities within Sierra Leone (see para. 3.3 and Box 3). A&#13;
broad consensus was reached on a number of key areas, which formed the basis for the&#13;
development of the core program. As described in the NHAP, the programs of highest priority&#13;
are: (a) maternal and child health, including family planning; (b) communicable disease&#13;
control; (c) sanitation and clean water; and (d) health education. The lack of awareness about&#13;
the emerging threat of HIV infection and the relatively low priority accorded to HIV&#13;
prevention is a concern that will need to be addressed as a major challenge for the DOH and&#13;
the Disease Prevention and Control and Health Education units in particular. There are also&#13;
four cross-cutting issues of the reform program that DOH has recognized as needing urgent&#13;
attention: (a) expanding and strengthening peripheral health units; (b) confronting the&#13;
problems of high health service fees and drug pricing; (c) increasing community involvement&#13;
in health service planning, execution and oversight; and (d) planning for decentralization.&#13;
Although there are many concerns about the need to build a new tertiary care facility, a&#13;
difficult decision was made to exclude it from the core program for the next three years.&#13;
Annex 7 demonstrates how decisions were taken on the core program, and how it compares to&#13;
the initial total program, and the essential packages of care described in the Better Health in&#13;
Africa study, and the World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health.&#13;
B. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.4    In the NHAP, the Government is proposing a major reform and restructuring of the&#13;
health sector. In addition to radical organizational changes and substantial human resources&#13;
development, the program proposes a substantial rehabilitation of health services, primarily in&#13;
rural areas, by soliciting community involvement, repairing or constructing health facilities,&#13;
training health personnel for clinical and managerial responsibilities, and investing in support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
services and systems that are needed to sustain operations. In summary, implementation of the&#13;
NHAP is intended to:&#13;
(a)   Increase access to health care by:&#13;
(i)   rehabilitating existing health facilities to make them functional;&#13;
(ii)   creating new health posts and health centers;&#13;
(iii)  increasing access to health workers trained and equipped for midwifery&#13;
and family planning;&#13;
(iv)   enhancing the community health skills of health workers; and&#13;
(v)   implementing EEC strategies to increase demand for health and family&#13;
planning services and to improve healthy behaviors, including the&#13;
prevention of HIV transmission.&#13;
(b)   Improve the quality of health care by:&#13;
(i)   training, retraining and supervising health workers;&#13;
(ii)   providing drugs, contraceptives, vaccines, materials and logistic support;&#13;
(iii)  rehabilitating existing clinics and hospitals; and&#13;
(iv)   making health services responsive to community needs.&#13;
(c)   Strengthen the management of health care by:&#13;
(i)   involving communities in health care management;&#13;
(ii)   developing management skills and establishing management systems;&#13;
(iii)  decentralizing the management of health service delivery to the district&#13;
level;&#13;
(iv)  reorganizing and strengthening the central Department of Health; and&#13;
(v)   defining and implementing a core set of technical programs and support&#13;
services.&#13;
(d)  Improve the financing for health care by:&#13;
(i)   increasing Government expenditures on health care;&#13;
(ii)  involving donors and non-governmental organizations; and&#13;
(iii)  attracting more household health expenditures to an improved public&#13;
sector health service.&#13;
Definition of NHAP technical programs and support services&#13;
4.5     The NHAP organizes the overall sector program into eight technical programs and&#13;
six support services. Technical programs are the elements of the system which directly deliver&#13;
health services to the public. The technical programs include six Primary Health Care (PHC)&#13;
services: (a) Maternal-Child Health, including Family Planning; (b) Treatment of Common&#13;
Ailments; (c) Communicable Disease Control; (d) Sanitation and Water; (e) Nutrition; and (f)&#13;
Information, Education and Communications; along with (g) Secondary Health Care; and (h)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Tertiary Health Care. Support services are those functions which are needed to support the&#13;
technical programs, and include: (a) Drugs and Medical Supplies; (b) Laboratory Services; (c)&#13;
Infrastructure, Equipment, Transport and Maintenance; (d) Human Resources; (e) Planning&#13;
and Information Systems; and (f) Central Administration. Consideration is also given to legal&#13;
aspects and private practice, though no funding has been allocated to them at this time. A&#13;
description of the proposed activities under each of the technical programs and support&#13;
services is outlined in Annex 8; a further description of the initial total program is provided in&#13;
the NHAP, while the core program is detailed in the Government paper: Better Health in&#13;
Sierra Leone: A Proposalfor Donor Funding (it has subsequently been revised to improve&#13;
consistency and to integrate a number of sub-services at the operational level).&#13;
4.6     The on-going programs are designed so that they will not be implemented as vertical&#13;
programs, but as part of a package of essential health services. The 13 districts will become&#13;
the focus of operational planning and implementation. Following general guidance of the&#13;
central DOH, the District Health Management Teams (DHMT) will be responsible for&#13;
planning and delivery of most elements of the six PHC services in their own district. The&#13;
operational details of how the specific services will be provided in each area will be worked&#13;
out m each district as part of their annual planning exercise, with the PHUs expected to deliver&#13;
much of the preventive and primary curative services. Each PHU will be linked to a district&#13;
level hospital which will provide first referral services. Larger hospitals will provide more of&#13;
the same services as the district hospitals, and also function as referral points for more&#13;
specialized services (tertiary health care services). The larger hospitals will be under the&#13;
administration of newly created hospital management committees.&#13;
Health facilities rehabilitation and re-tooling&#13;
4.7    In the NHAP, the Government not only redefines the type of services that are to be&#13;
provided in Sierra Leone, but points out that a substantial increase in access to services is&#13;
needed if the health goals are to be met. This will entail a substantial investment in&#13;
rehabilitation of PHUs and hospitals, and an expansion of new PHUs to under-serviced areas.&#13;
In early 1994, a DOH survey found that there were 504 Government-run PHUs in the country.&#13;
Most of them are ill equipped and in dire need of repair, and many are not operational due to&#13;
the poor state of the facility or because of civil conflict in the area. The DOH is currently&#13;
rehabilitating 17 PHUs and 3 hospitals. It has prioritized another 44 PHUs and 10 hospitals&#13;
for the next stage of repairs, and identified the next 7 of 57 locations in under-served areas&#13;
where it intends to build new PHUs. The bidding documents have already been prepared for&#13;
the next 15 PHUs and 3 hospitals. Based on criteria of populations served by health facilities,&#13;
it was estimated that the country will need about 600 PHUs by the end of the century (400&#13;
health posts, each serving about 5,000 people, and 200 health centers, covering populations of&#13;
10,000 to 20,000 inhabitants). The long range plans are to replace the health posts with health&#13;
centers, but there are not sufficient physical or manpower resources at this time. The main&#13;
criteria for initial selection for rehabilitation or construction are the distance to another&#13;
working clinic (either public or private) and the size of the population served. Functional&#13;
water and power supply are pre-requisites to any building repair or re-equipping. The selected&#13;
PHUs will need to be in locations where the civil situation is secure for rehabilitation to be&#13;
considered. Because of the security situation, the specific sites and the volume of operations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
will be revised and adjusted with each annual plan, or more often if required. In the future, the&#13;
District Management Team's ability to plan and implement health plans will also be&#13;
considered. The DOH also has specific plans for repairing and re-equipping the existing&#13;
Govemment hospitals, so that they will be able to better serve as first referral facilities.&#13;
Government spending on tertiary care services will be held constant in the next years of the&#13;
NHAP, though hospitals may open private wings which may provide such services, to be&#13;
financed out of private sources. Part of the DOH plan to make the clinical and public health&#13;
laboratory services functional includes reconstruction of laboratory space to consolidate the&#13;
central laboratories, and rehabilitation of peripheral laboratories. As part of the preparation for&#13;
this work, and in order to take advantage of economies of scale, the DOH is standardizing the&#13;
civil works designs and equipment requirements for each level of facility. In addition to&#13;
developing a database of major repair and equipment needs, the central DOH is spearheading&#13;
the development of an asset registry for all new buildings and equipment, and of maintenance&#13;
schedules as part of an effort to upgrade its maintenance and repair unit.&#13;
Institutional development&#13;
4.8    In order to achieve the sectoral goals and implement the technical programs and&#13;
support services, the DOH is currently being strengthened at both headquarters and district&#13;
levels to manage a more effective health service for Sierra Leone. The focus of these changes&#13;
will be in four key interlocking areas:&#13;
(a) enhancing the authority of the DOH on key financial and personnel decisions in&#13;
relation to Central Government;&#13;
(b) strengthening the role of the DOH headquarters in policy and strategy&#13;
formulation, planning, budgeting and health financing, and problem solving and&#13;
support for district management teams;&#13;
(c) building the capacity of district management teams to plan, manage and&#13;
supervise health services delivered by hospitals and PHUs; and&#13;
(d) developing the skills and experience of personnel deployed in both health&#13;
service delivery and support services.&#13;
4.9   DOH authority over finance and personnel. Decision-making in Government on&#13;
personnel and financial matters is highly centralized, thereby affecting the health service by&#13;
impairing the quality of decisions and undermining the DOH's accountability for health sector&#13;
performance. Accordingly, the GOSL has indicated that the DOH has obtained from the&#13;
Department of Finance and the Establishment Secretary:&#13;
(a)   authority to decide manpower and line item budgets, in relation to the core&#13;
program, and within an overall departmental and program ceilings agreed with the&#13;
Department of Finance;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(b)   real influence over the recruitment and selection process, and the application of&#13;
employment practices for staff promotions, discipline and transfers; and&#13;
(c)   authority to determine the numbers, categories, and skill mix of staff required in&#13;
line with an overall departmental manpower plan, as well as some discretion over&#13;
individual's pay within established salary structures.&#13;
4.10    Steps to delegate authority to the DOH will be carefully coordinated with parallel&#13;
measures to introduce improved central accounting and budgeting systems, rationalized&#13;
manpower levels and revised salary scales. Both financial and personnel management within&#13;
the DOH will be strengthened in terms of upgraded skills and improved systems to enable&#13;
delegated authority to be fully effective.&#13;
4.11    Strengthened DOH headquarters. Currently the DOH headquarters plays an active&#13;
role both in authorizing expenditure and the management of health programs, through&#13;
monitoring and direct supervision. The DOH intends to "decentralize" the health system&#13;
which will shift health program management (and expenditure authorization) to the district&#13;
level. Accordingly, the role of headquarters will be strengthened to concentrate on:&#13;
(a)   policy and strategy formulation, planning, budgeting, evaluation and the&#13;
establishment of norms, and developing alternative strategies and mechanisms for&#13;
financing health care;&#13;
(b)   providing technical assistance in the form of support and problem solving for&#13;
district management teams, rather than direct program management, and by means of&#13;
monitoring and direct supervision;&#13;
(c)   the analysis and processing of management information for use by head office&#13;
and district managers; and&#13;
(d)   the provision of central services, such as laboratory and pharmaceutical services&#13;
and management support services.&#13;
4.12    The DOH has begun to implement its institutional reform plans to enable it to&#13;
effectively fulfill its new role. This will necessitate:&#13;
(a)   complete transition to its recently revised organization structure which is more&#13;
service-oriented and matches NHAP objectives. As a condition for effectiveness, the&#13;
DOH would staff the following key positions: Director of Management Support,&#13;
Director of Financial Resources, Chief Procurement Officer, and a supporting position&#13;
at the Donor Relations Office to monitor and coordinate donor programs and budgets&#13;
(para. 7.3(h));&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(b)   the adaptation of the organization culture to one which is more decentralized&#13;
and formalized to enable "decentralization" to be effective;&#13;
(c)   the development of management control strategies and systems more&#13;
appropriate for a "decentralized" health service;&#13;
(d)   building systems and developing professional competence in personnel and&#13;
financial management, procurement and management information; and&#13;
(e)   improvements in personnel and reward systems, and in training.&#13;
4.13    District management. District Health Management Teams will gradually be given&#13;
greater authority over operational, financial and personnel decisions, and responsibility to&#13;
prepare district health plans. Guidelines for developing district health plans are being&#13;
developed and field tested in a number of districts. These plans are to play an increasingly&#13;
prominent role in the determination of DOH activities and budgets. Since few people at the&#13;
district level have experience in planning and management, technical assistance and training is&#13;
planned in the areas of health planning, as well as in community health care, team building,&#13;
financial management and accounting, so that the district teams will be able to plan,&#13;
implement, and monitor health care, family planning and nutrition activities in their districts.&#13;
As a condition for negotiations, guidelines for district health planning to make District&#13;
Health Management Teams functional, and indicating decentralization of decision-making in&#13;
the sector were submitted to IDA. At negotiations, assurances were provided that the GOSL&#13;
will give budgetary authority to implement a prepared district health plan to at least one&#13;
additional district in each year of the operation (para. 7. I(a)). Community representation and&#13;
accountability is expected to play a prominent role in these plans. The pace of decentralization&#13;
will be quite cautious, and will depend on the security situation in the country and on the&#13;
progress made in the first districts with decentralized authority.&#13;
4.14    Strengthening district management will involve the following changes in both&#13;
organization structure and culture in line with the spirit of "decentralization."&#13;
(a)   The Provincial level of management will be removed, thereby providing the&#13;
districts with direct reporting to headquarters.&#13;
(b)   The DHMT will exercise managerial authority over the PHUs, namely the&#13;
health centers and health posts. Members of this team would also provide technical&#13;
supervision over the activities of the health centers, and the health posts would be&#13;
directly supervised from the health centers.&#13;
(c)   District health planning will be conducted and mechanisms established for&#13;
involving communities in the planning process. District Development Committees and&#13;
Health Committees will be set up to enable key stakeholders to influence and review&#13;
these plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(d)   The DHMT will coordinate the activities of NGOs and the private sector in&#13;
order to improve the coverage of health services.&#13;
4.15    Human resource development. Significant changes are proposed in nearly all&#13;
facets of manpower development. Enhancing institutional capacity will involve considerable&#13;
training and management development across the DOH. This will involve managerial,&#13;
professional and technical personnel drawn from support service as well as health service&#13;
functions. The DOH manpower plan was developed on the basis of a reappraisal of the type of&#13;
health personnel needed at each level of the system, compared with its existing resources based&#13;
on a 1994 census of health personnel (though three of the districts were not included due to the&#13;
ongoing conflict). Analysis of the personnel census revealed that there are nearly 2,000&#13;
workers being paid by the Establishments Department who were no longer working in the&#13;
DOH. As a condition for Board presentation, the Government submitted to IDA a detailed&#13;
plan and timetable for reconciling the DOH payroll and the actual DOH staff census (para.&#13;
7.2(a)). The priority areas of training are shown below in Table 4.1, whereas Annex 9&#13;
summarizes the proposed training plan for the sector. One of the most significant changes is&#13;
that the wide variety of PHC staff and training programs will be simplified, phasing out single-&#13;
purpose workers and developing a cadre of PHC workers with polyvalent skills and greater&#13;
ability to deal with communities. Large gaps in job categories (especially for hospital nurses,&#13;
community health assistants, and community health aides) would mostly be met by&#13;
redeployment and retraining of existing workers, and substantial training of new recruits.&#13;
Existing training institutions, namely the School of Hygiene and the Paramedical School,&#13;
would be merged and strengthened in terms of improved and revised curricula, and upgraded&#13;
skills in training design and delivery. It is still likely that shortages of skilled personnel will&#13;
exist five years from now, although guidelines have been drafted to improve the utilization of&#13;
the manpower to achieve the most efficient and equitable service coverage. A management&#13;
training program is a major component of the manpower plan, and is designed for developing&#13;
new skills and practices of senior managers, middle managers, and a critical mass from each&#13;
DHMT. Most of the training will be conducted in Sierra Leone (using local institutions where&#13;
possible), although it will also include other countries in the region and outside the continent,&#13;
where appropriate. The substantial investments in training (estimated at US$5.2 million) will&#13;
be closely coordinated with actions taken to improve the working environment, pay and&#13;
incentives, and performance appraisal systems.&#13;
The first year program&#13;
4.16    The first year of the prograrn has been designed to set the foundation for the NHAP&#13;
implementation while addressing the current security situation. Detailed activities and budgets&#13;
for the first 12 months were prepared by the DOH staff for the entire program, and are&#13;
included in the DOH Operational Manual. Since many of the districts are currently&#13;
inaccessible, more central level activities are programmed for the first year. The emphasis on&#13;
improving the ongoing service delivery will focus on the Western Area and the towns where&#13;
the populations have concentrated. It is estimated that 1.5 million people are now living in&#13;
Western area. Physical project supervision in these areas is currently going on, and should be&#13;
possible during the coming years. Maternal and child health services, including family&#13;
planning, obstetrics, and well-child care, along with communicable disease control, water and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
sanitation services, and nutrition take the majority of inputs for service delivery. Emergency&#13;
assistance for refugees is being handled separately from routine DOH activities, under an&#13;
umbrella organization in the Government. Implementation of the institutional changes in the&#13;
DOH is another highlight of the first year's plan. Staff have been reassigned to the new units&#13;
of the Department, but further work and support is planned for 1996 to get them fully&#13;
functional. The key areas include Management, Financial Management, Procurement, and&#13;
Maintenance and Repair. Human resources development will comprise a major part of the first&#13;
year: curricula at the training institutions will be revised, and the first year of the new cadres of&#13;
peripheral health staff is expected this year, while personnel systems will be set up. Revising&#13;
the health information system is also planned during the first year. Decentralization will be&#13;
implemented slowly during this year. The Western Area District Health Management Team&#13;
has developed its district plan, and will be given authority to implement the plan, including&#13;
budgetary allocations for non-wage recurrent expenditures. Physical rehabilitation will&#13;
concentrate in the Western Area. Three hospitals, 17 PHUs, a maintenance facility, and a drug&#13;
warehouse, all in the Western Area, are scheduled for rehabilitation in 1996. A health&#13;
facilities infrastructure and equipment survey will be extended in a phased manner to cover the&#13;
remainder of the country, and it will form the basis for specific rehabilitation plans in the&#13;
subsequent years. Essential drugs, contraceptives, vaccines and laboratory reagents for PHUs&#13;
and hospitals will also be purchased and distributed.&#13;

C. PROGRAM COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
4.17    Health sector budget. The Government funding for the health sector is, at present,&#13;
limited mainly by the economy's capacity to generate income, and the Government's ability to&#13;
collect taxes. Therefore, only a conservative projection-to be reviewed annually-of health&#13;
sector budget increases has been made. This is based on the assumption-in line with the&#13;
ongoing structural adjustment program-that total Government expenditures remain limited to&#13;
about 20 percent of GDP and that the share of allocation to the health sector steadily increases&#13;
from about five percent in 1995 to about seven percent of total Government budget in 2000&#13;
(see Annex 10). The most critical part of most Government financing is the non-salary&#13;
recurrent component of the budget. In Sierra Leone the share of the non-salary recurrent&#13;
budget in the total recurrent health budget is exceptionally high (about 70%) but expected to&#13;
fall somewhat in the future as critical health personnel will be recruited and salaries might be&#13;
adjusted in the context of a Civil Service Reform. However, Government ought to endeavor to&#13;
maintain the share of its non-salary expenditures in the sector at low levels, should any&#13;
improvements in health services be achieved in the following years.&#13;
4.18    Costs. The total cost for the core program for fiscal year 1996-2000 is about&#13;
US$138 million, or about US$5.5 per capita per annum, with the breakdown shown in detail in&#13;
Annex 10 (see also para. 3.3). Technical programs would receive 55 percent of the total&#13;
program funds, of which primary health care would receive about 60 percent, and secondary&#13;
and tertiary care about 40 percent. The support services, which cut across the technical&#13;
programs, would receive about 45 percent of the total funds, including the rehabilitation of&#13;
health facilities (17% of total funds).&#13;
4.19    Detailed costs are determined on an annual basis in the NHAP, to coordinate&#13;
Government and donor budget preparation. The total cost for the first year of the program is&#13;
US$25.6 million equivalent, with foreign exchange costs estimated at US$11 million, or 43&#13;
percent of the total costs. Table 4.2 summarizes the costs of the first year of the program,&#13;
according to component, and Table 4.3 summarizes the costs according to expenditure&#13;
category.&#13;

4.20 Financing. It is expected that Government will contribute about US$63 million (46%)&#13;
to the core program over the next five years. The IDA credit is estimated to be about US$20&#13;
million, covering about 14 percent of the program costs. It is also expected that the remainder,&#13;
US$55 million, will be made up through donor contributions, an amount well within the stated&#13;
intentions of donors attending the Social Sectors Round Tables. Table 4.4 provides a&#13;
summary of donor commitment to the NHAP (FY96 - FY00) based on pledges made at the&#13;
Second Social Sectors Donor's Meeting and subsequent discussions held with GOSL and&#13;
development partners. Table 4.5 shows the donor financing to various progran areas. The&#13;
IDA credit would represent initial support for IDA's long term commitment to rehabilitation of&#13;
the sector. The credit would fund a "time slice" of sub-sectors of the health budget-both&#13;
operational and developmental-to support the core program, and would be eligible for any&#13;
foreign exchange or local costs net of duties and taxes, with the exception of the following&#13;
items: land acquisition; donations; salaries of non-imcremental personnel; subscriptions and&#13;
membership fees; and overseas medical expenses.&#13;

4.21     A detailed determination of all investment items for the program would be done for&#13;
each year through the annual planning processes. A traditional investment would not be&#13;
supportive of the Sierra Leone program, particularly as it hopes to decentralize responsibility&#13;
to district teams and hospitals, and to institutionalize the annual planning and budgeting&#13;
process. IDA's role will be to help ensure that all agreed and vital elements of the annual plans&#13;
are funded. Therefore, financing through the credit would be phased to coincide with the&#13;
annual budgets and workplans of the DOH, as agreed with IDA and other donors. Funding&#13;
will be dependent on coordinated planning processes with Government, local stakeholders, and&#13;
other donors, to ensure an appropriate sequence and pace of action, and to avoid the&#13;
continuation of small, disparate, donor-driven projects. External financing would be made&#13;
available as progress is made on the specific annual workplans of the sector. As shown in&#13;
Table 4.6, Government input is expected to increase over the program period while donor&#13;
contributions are declining as a proportion of total expenditures.&#13;

* The Govermment has provided assurances that provision to the health sector in FY 1996 will amount to USS8.7 million&#13;
for recurrent expenditures and USS1.5 million for development expenditures.&#13;
4.22    IDA funds will be made available annually when there has been satisfactory&#13;
completion of the previous year's DOH budget and workplan and upon receipt of satisfactory&#13;
evidence of GOSL and donor commitments to the sector plan and budget for the respective&#13;
fiscal year. The estimated disbursement of the IDA Credit is indicated in Table 4.6. IDA&#13;
contribution will not exceed 25% of the annual sector budget. Over the years, as a result of the&#13;
progress in decentralization, the sector plans and budgets will be increasingly based on the&#13;
budget proposals and workplans of the DHMTs and the hospitals. Identified core program&#13;
activities will be carried out with budget control under the management of the Division heads&#13;
of technical and support services. All support services will need to be fully funded, including&#13;
specific allocations for Drugs and Medical Supplies, and maintenance and repairs. Specific&#13;
performance targets will be agreed on for each year of the program, to provide a basis for&#13;
continued funding of activities. The draft set of performance indicators for the first years of&#13;
the program are shown in Annex 11. If performance targets regarding Government fiscal&#13;
effort have not been met, IDA and other donors will adjust their funding for subsequent years.&#13;

V. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. STATUS OF PROGRAM PREPARATION&#13;
5.1     The proposed Integrated Health Sector Investment Project was prepared in response&#13;
to a request from the Department of Health for IDA to assist in developing a policy framework&#13;
and sector development program to reform the sector, and to coordinate donor, Government&#13;
and private sector efforts. As described in Chapter III, the program has been prepared by the&#13;
DOH in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including other Government&#13;
Departments, private sector health care providers and non-governmental organizations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
(NGOs), community representatives, and multilateral agencies, including among others, WHO,&#13;
UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and IDA.&#13;
5.2     The Government's reform program is an ongoing effort that needs to occur at the&#13;
same time that it is attempting to restore basic services. Some of the critical areas under&#13;
preparation include: (a) institutional arrangements to implement the program; (b) the program&#13;
content itself, and (c) costs and financing.&#13;
(a)   Institutional arrangements and capacity. An institutional assessment of the&#13;
DOH and an analysis of job tasks have been done, resulting in reformed organizational&#13;
structure of the central DOH, and a decision to successively decentralize authority for&#13;
implementation of health care delivery to districts and hospitals. It has already been&#13;
decided that the program will operate through the permanent DOH structure, and that&#13;
there will be no separate project implementation units for individual donor programs.&#13;
Departmental Units have been established, and staff assigned to the new units.&#13;
Program coordination and donor liaison functions have been incorporated into the new&#13;
organizational structure of the DOH. As a condition for negotiations, the DOH&#13;
submitted to IDA the detailed description of the finalized re-organization of the DOH,&#13;
including terms of reference for key offices for NHAP implementation, including the&#13;
DOH Management Team, the Management Support Office, and a Financial&#13;
Management Team. Submission to IDA of a draft Operational Manual, detailing the&#13;
roles, responsibilities, and implementation procedures under the program for the&#13;
Department of Health was a condition for negotiations. To strengthen the DOH so&#13;
that it will be able to perform its new roles, considerable training and technical&#13;
assistance will be needed, particularly in the areas of financial management,&#13;
procurement and general management. Plans to set up the systems are currently being&#13;
developed. As a condition of effectiveness, technical assistance agreements with a&#13;
financial management consultant firm and a procurement technical assistance agency&#13;
for at least 12 months each, for support services to be provided during the first two&#13;
years of the project, and an agency to conduct the in-house management training (the&#13;
Sierra Leone Institute for Public Administration and Management) would be signed&#13;
under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA (para. 7.2 (a &amp; b)).&#13;
(b)   The program. After the planning workshops and extensive priority-setting&#13;
exercises, the NHAP core program clearly identifies priorities of sector programs and&#13;
activities. Submission to IDA of a draft Letter of Health Sector Development Policy,&#13;
outlining the specific policy commitments of Government to the NHAP, the priorities&#13;
for Government, private and donor funding, and indicating that the DOH is given&#13;
authority to decide manpower and line item budgets within the program resource&#13;
ceilings agreed with the DOF, and the authority over staff numbers, selection,&#13;
promotions, discipline and pay within the established salary structure was a condition&#13;
for negotiations (also outlined in para. 4.9). Submission of a draft Letter of Health&#13;
Sector Development Policy, satisfactory to IDA, was a condition for negotiations, and&#13;
was signed as a condition of Board presentation (para. 7.2(b)). Work in the following&#13;
areas needs has been submitted to IDA as a condition for negotiations: (i) the final&#13;
detailed first year implementation plan and budget for the program; (ii) a finalized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
human resources plan showing commitment to rationalizing health personnel and&#13;
decentralizing service delivery; and (iii) completion of the formal beneficiary&#13;
assessment. As a condition for effectiveness, the Government would submit to IDA (i)&#13;
the training plan and (ii) the plan for recruitment and redeployment of staff for those&#13;
health facilities of the Western Region where rehabilitation and construction works is&#13;
to take place during the first year of the project (para 7.3(c)).&#13;
(c)   Costs and financing. At the Social Sectors Round Table meetings in May&#13;
1994, Government reconfirmed its commitment to increase allocation to the health&#13;
sector during the program period in line with the SAP. Other donors pledged about&#13;
US$55 million to the NHAP, but actual commitments need to be reconfirmed regularly.&#13;
At the Donors Conference, in October 1995, donors and NGOs pledges to the sector for&#13;
FY 1996 were over US$12 million. Government is confident to obtain additional&#13;
funding in the amount of US$3.3 million from donors not represented at the&#13;
Conference, thereby closing the financing gap for FY 1996. Because little is known&#13;
about how much the private sector and households contribute to the sector, a study is&#13;
being conducted to describe the financing options and mechanisms to optimize the&#13;
public/private mix of financing and service provision.&#13;
B. PROGRAM IMLEMENTATION (MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION)&#13;
5.3    The DOH, through its staff working within its permanent organization structure&#13;
(shown in Annex 12), will be responsible for implementation of the NHAP. The various&#13;
multilateral and bilateral donors have agreed to adopt this consistent and common management&#13;
and implementation approach for all financing agencies and for all components under the&#13;
program. A new organization structure has been adapted by the DOH to facilitate this, and&#13;
management systems of the DOH are being established, particularly in accounting and&#13;
budgeting arrangements, and district planning.&#13;
5.4    At the head of the new DOH is a DOH Management Team, comprised of the&#13;
Directors General, key heads of units of the DOH, and led by the Secretary of State.&#13;
Responsible managers within the strengthened structure, at both headquarters and district&#13;
levels, will be given the authority and resources to implement specific interventions and&#13;
services in the NHAP. Coordination of those interventions and services will be achieved&#13;
largely through the newly adopted organization structure and any special coordinating&#13;
mechanisms such as improved annual planning procedures, identified as part of the&#13;
institutional development component of the program.&#13;
5.5    As the implementation of the program will require new relationships to be built with&#13;
donors, a clear focal point is needed in the organization structure of the DOH to manage these&#13;
relations effectively. This will become one of the functions of the Donor Relations Office,&#13;
which reports to the DOH Management Team. The Director of Donor Relations is responsible&#13;
for managing and coordinating external relations. More importantly he/she will also be&#13;
responsible for monitoring donor programs and inputs to the sector; hence the need to&#13;
strengthen this office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
5.6    A Management Support Office, led by a technical officer providing support to the&#13;
DOH Management Team, will also be recruited to oversee the coordination of work of DOH&#13;
staff on the physical and technical program implementation activities as well as the monitoring&#13;
and reporting element of implementation. He/she will also provide and obtain information and&#13;
support to and from those managers responsible for implementation of the DOH program.&#13;
5.7    Management support services will be largely the responsibility the Financial&#13;
Managemtent Unit (i.e., accounting and disbursement), the Procurement Unit, and the Facilities&#13;
Management Unit (i.e., maintenance and repairs). These divisions will be strengthened by&#13;
upgrading the number of staff and their skills and by introducing improved systems which&#13;
would meet the different procurement and accounting requirements of both the Government&#13;
and individual donors. In addition, as an aid to more decentralized financial management, a&#13;
system of district level warrants will be introduced. The Planning, Monitoring, Information&#13;
and Statistics Unit (PMISU) will play a key role in the design and implementation of health&#13;
and management information, and in providing support to district planning, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
5.8    While the District Medical Officers would be responsible for program execution for&#13;
those areas within their jurisdiction, communities would be involved in both the planning and&#13;
management of health services and their periodic review. It is anticipated that such&#13;
arrangements will strengthen accountability and improve the quality of services. Conditions of&#13;
effectiveness have been designed to strengthen the DOH's implementation capacity in&#13;
preparation of Program implementation (para. 7.3). A summary of the implementation&#13;
program is shown in Annex 13, with a outline of an Operational Manual shown in Annex 14.&#13;
The Operational Manual would be finalized as a condition for effectiveness (para. 7.3(d)).&#13;
C. PROGRAM SUSTAINABILITY AND RECURRENT COST IMPLICATIONS&#13;
5.9    In response to the current state of collapse and fragmentation in the health care&#13;
system, sustainability is an integral part of the sector goals. The reform program seeks to&#13;
achieve social sustainability by soliciting community support in the preparation of the&#13;
program, and by ensuring an important role for the community in the operation and&#13;
maintenance of health services, so that the health system becomes more accountable to the&#13;
communities that they serve. The program currently enjoys considerable political support, as&#13;
evidenced by the involvement of the President and cabinet in the launching of the National&#13;
Health Policy and NHAP, and by the eagerness to make major policy decisions. Efforts will&#13;
be made to maintain the political support through continued involvement of key decision-&#13;
makers in the planning and evaluation of health services. A major challenge of the program is&#13;
to develop managerial and technical capacity to ensure sustainability of the health care&#13;
delivery. This is why the program intends to put heavy investments in training (both formal&#13;
and on-the-job), technical assistance, and the establishment of management systems to develop&#13;
the necessary cadre of appropriately trained people to meet local needs and to plan for services&#13;
that respond to these needs. To build up local capacity, local technical assistance and training&#13;
will be used as much as possible, and the modalities for long term technical assistance, where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
required, will be designed to maximize local capacity and control. For example, long term&#13;
assistance may be done through twinning arrangements with external public health and&#13;
medical organizations, and use and development of local consultancy capacity.&#13;
5.10    Financial sustainability. The program aims to be financially sustainable in the long&#13;
run, but will be dependent on considerable donor investment in the short and medium term.&#13;
Government health expenditures are expected to increase from US$10.3 million in FY 1996 to&#13;
US$15.0 million in FY 2000 over the next five years. Government financing will cover an&#13;
increasing proportion of the core program (40% in 1996 to 52% in 1999). The increases are&#13;
based on commitments to increasing Government allocations to health, and on projections for&#13;
economic growth. On a per capita basis, the total program expects to spend about US$5.5 per&#13;
capita per annum at the end of the program, double the current public and donor expenditures.&#13;
According to Better Health In AJrica, a well-run system would cost, in low revenue countries,&#13;
around US$9 per capita (1993). Thus, it is likely that continued increase in health financing&#13;
will be needed in Sierra Leone, and that additional financing will be needed from private&#13;
sector sources and households. Increased household expenditures on more effective public and&#13;
private services is anticipated as the quality of these services improve. As mentioned, the&#13;
program foresees external financing by donors on a declining basis.&#13;
D. PROGRAM MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
5.11    Program monitoring, that is measuring, evaluating and reporting progress, would be&#13;
the responsibility of the DOH and those line managers responsible for specific interventions&#13;
and services. The Management Support Office will coordinate this effort in the central DOH,&#13;
and will bring together all parties involved so that key issues are dealt with through discussions&#13;
among those concerned. The line managers would be, in turn, responsible for taking any&#13;
necessary corrective action, as indicated by the monitoring information. The PMISU will&#13;
undertake to coordinate program monitoring and reporting on health services performance&#13;
from the districts. In order to do this, the DOH will establish its own approach, acceptable to&#13;
the Bank and other donors, for developing annual workplans and reviewing progress on a&#13;
periodic basis. The annual workplans, to be agreed on by all donors, would form the basis for&#13;
reviewing progress on a regular basis. At negotiations, assurances were provided that&#13;
Government will submit a three-year rolling plan, an annual progress report, and a draft&#13;
detailed implementation plan and budget at least three months prior to the beginning of each&#13;
fiscal year, and prior to an annual Government-led meeting with donors where progress on the&#13;
previous year's health program would be reviewed and specific financing commitments made&#13;
for the next year in advance of the submission of the Government's annual budget (para.&#13;
7. 1(b)).&#13;
5.12    Progress reports will be made available to donors and the recently-established Aid&#13;
Coordination Unit at the Department of Development and Planning, which is charged, among&#13;
other things, with coordinating donor assistance to the Government's Public Health Sector&#13;
Investment Program. The Donor Liaison Officer would be responsible for collating the&#13;
periodic reports for submission to Government and donors. The program reporting system to&#13;
be developed would establish short-term targets and indicators as appropriate for each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
component of the program, regardless of the funding source. These measures will enable the&#13;
responsible line managers to check whether program components are on track, in termns of&#13;
achieving the desired outputs spelled out in the NHAP for the different technical programs and&#13;
support services. Therefore, there is need for clear conceptual linkages between the&#13;
intermediate reporting measures and the long-term output and impact indicators used for the&#13;
program.&#13;
5.13    Specific targets are given for involvement of communities in districts and hospital&#13;
boards, development of standards for quality, outputs targets for training and rehabilitation of&#13;
facilities and utilization of facilities, and impact targets for mortality, fertility, and disease rate&#13;
reduction (Annex 11). For example, the impact targets for the year 2000 include: infant&#13;
mortality at 70 deaths per 1000 live births; under 5 mortality at 160 deaths per 1000 live births;&#13;
and total fertility rate at 6.0 children. During negotiations, assurances were provided that&#13;
Government will meet the key time-bound performance indicators agreed on for the program,&#13;
as shown in Annex 11 (para. 7.4(c)). In addition, assurances were provided by Government&#13;
during negotiations that it will undertake the following measures in support of the NHAP: (a)&#13;
develop a health sector financing plan by the end of 1997 to identify the public and private&#13;
financing mix of health services; (b) institutionalize feedback of health service users by&#13;
conducting formal beneficiary assessments in 1998 and 2000; (c) conduct a national household&#13;
survey on health behaviors, health status and health expenditures in 1999; and (d) initiate a&#13;
certificate of need process whereby all capital investments above US$25,000 must obtain&#13;
formal approval from the DOH Management Team to justify investments according to priority,&#13;
based on the criteria of: (i) meeting community needs; (ii) addressing program goals; and (iii)&#13;
the affordability of the proposal. (para. 7.1(d)).&#13;
5.14    The Monitoring cycle. A regular program planning and monitoring cycle would be&#13;
established under the NHAP, based on the Government's financial calendar. A progress report&#13;
and draft rolling implementation plan and budget, covering activities, training, and&#13;
procurement would be circulated to donors at least three months before the beginning of the&#13;
next fiscal year. Two months before the beginning of the next fiscal year, Government would&#13;
convene a joint meeting with donors to review progress made during the previous year, and&#13;
finalize specific financial commitments for the coming year, based on the draft plans.&#13;
Eventually, the national plan would be a consolidation of previously prepared District and&#13;
central DOH plans. One month before the end of the fiscal year, the annual implementation&#13;
plan and budget for the next FY would be agreed upon for Government and donor&#13;
disbursement. Government would produce an annual progress report, summarizing reports&#13;
from the Districts and the DOH programs, for distribution among donors, prior to supervision&#13;
mission. These reports would not only indicate progress in relation to the plans from the&#13;
central DOH and the districts, they would also report actions taken to resolve problems. The&#13;
Management Support Officer would liaise with the respective line managers to ensure that they&#13;
submit timely written progress reports on the specific program interventions and services for&#13;
which they are responsible. Formal Bank supervision missions-to be carried out in&#13;
collaboration with donors and NGOs-would take place at least twice a year, and one of these&#13;
will be scheduled to follow the receipt of the annual report from the DOH, and will continue&#13;
with the program annual review and the donor consultation meeting on sector plan and budget&#13;
for the next fiscal year (see Annex 15 and also 5.15 below). The primary objective of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
supervision would be to provide support and guidance to the DOH to solve those problems&#13;
which it is unable to resolve by itself. The program has budgeted for the DOH to hire&#13;
additional technical assistance for the preparation of sector plans and budgets. This approach&#13;
to supervision places the responsibility firmly with the DOH, so that the Borrower would take&#13;
its own necessary corrective action on the basis of monitoring information available before the&#13;
arrival of a donor supervision mission. The DOH will also provide Part II of the Program&#13;
Completion Report to IDA within six months of the closing date.&#13;
E. ANNUAL AND MID-TERM REVIEWS&#13;
5.15    A comprehensive annual review of the program conducted jointly with the&#13;
Government and other donors is an important feature of the operation. These reviews would&#13;
focus on the achievement of the intermediate targets and indicators in the agreed upon annual&#13;
workplan and the reasons for any variation. The approach to the reviews would be forward-&#13;
looking, endeavoring to identify factors which are likely to impede progress in the following&#13;
year, and taking necessary steps to overcome these constraints in a timely manner or to amend&#13;
objectives in the light of changing circumstances. The reviews would also assess progress on&#13;
the indicators of the NHAP and decide whether financial resources from the Credit would be&#13;
made available for the implementation of program activities. The implications of the findings&#13;
of the annual review for the current year's workplan would also be examined, and the workplan&#13;
would subsequently be amended as appropriate.&#13;
5.16    Assurances were provided at negotiations, that in the third year of the program, a&#13;
mid-term review will be carried out jointly with the Government and other donors to assess the&#13;
program achievement toward meeting its original objectives (para. 4.1) and targets (Annex&#13;
11), and on that basis make necessary adjustments in program objectives, inputs and&#13;
performance indicators prior to starting the second phase of the program (para. 7.1(e)). The&#13;
Government will prepare, two months ahead of time, a report required for a comprehensive&#13;
mid-term review covering all aspects of the program being implemented (both at headquarters&#13;
and district levels). Based on the outcome of the review, the Government and other donors&#13;
will agree on whether to alter program objectives and/or to reduce or increase the scope of the&#13;
program. Government will then prepare a revised NHAP that will reflect any agreed changes&#13;
for improving program implementation.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
5.17    This project is classified as category C in view of its negligible environmental effects.&#13;
Because the program includes improvements in sanitation, food hygiene, and medical waste,&#13;
the net effects of the program are expected to be beneficial to the environment.&#13;
G. PROCUREMENT&#13;
5.18    As is the case for other sector investment credits, the credit is undetermined for&#13;
procurement purposes. The exact mix of civil works, goods and services to be financed by the&#13;
Credit will depend on the results of the annual planning process that will be reflected in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
annually agreed upon plans. The proposed totals for the procurement (and disbursement)&#13;
categories are thus expected to change during implementation. The initial estimates are shown&#13;
in Table 5. 1. National competitive bidding (NCB) procedures will include: (a) explicit&#13;
statement to bidders of the evaluation and award criteria; (b) local advertising with public bid&#13;
opening; (c) award to lowest evaluated bidder; and (d) foreign bidders would not be precluded&#13;
from participating in NCB. Government confirmed the above NCB principles during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
5.19    Government's overall procedures for procurement are being developed with IDA&#13;
assistance to ensure that they are economic, efficient, fair and acceptable to other contributors&#13;
to the NHAP. For the use of Government funds, the thresholds 2 for goods, works, and&#13;
services are currently as follows: purchases exceeding Le5 million require public tendering&#13;
through the Central Tenders Board (which meets at least every two weeks); purchases&#13;
between Le700,000 and Le5 million require public tendering through a Departmental Tender&#13;
Board; purchases between Le200,000 and Le700,000 require at least three price quotations;&#13;
and purchases under Le200,000 may be made at the discretion of the Vote Controller.&#13;
National bidding requires publication of invitations to tender in at least two local newspapers,&#13;
and a bidding period of at least one month. For international competition, the invitations are&#13;
also published in overseas newspapers and international trade journals, and disseminated to&#13;
local embassies, and a bidding period of at least nine weeks is required. A technical committee&#13;
makes recommendations for award based on the lowest evaluated bid, based on criteria clearly&#13;
described in the bidding documents. A register for contractors for works and services is being&#13;
maintained to classify them according to their financial standing and value of contracts for&#13;
works and services for which they are normally capable of carrying out satisfactorily. Further&#13;
details are outlined in the DOH Operations Manual. Procurement staff from the Management&#13;
Services Division will be trained in the new procedures, and assisted by a procurement agency.&#13;
5.20    Civil works. The programn's civil works include the construction of 57 health centers,&#13;
and the rehabilitation of 61 PHUs and 13 hospitals. For the use of IDA funds for civil works,&#13;
contracts for construction and rehabilitation estimated at more than US$500,000 per contract&#13;
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the&#13;
Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). The majority of&#13;
civil works are small and scattered, and unlikely to attract international bidders. The construction&#13;
of health centers and rehabilitation of clinics that cannot be grouped into large contracts or are less&#13;
than US$500,000 per contract and US$4.5 million in aggregate would be awarded on the basis of&#13;
competitive bidding advertised nationally (NCB) in accordance with procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA. Minor rehabilitation and repairs works that are estimated to cost less than US$25,000&#13;
equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate of US$0.5 million, would be procured under&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA on the basis of price quotations obtained from at least three local&#13;
reliable contractors who use local labor and materials, including participation of communities, to&#13;
the extent practical.&#13;
2 Government is currently revising thresholds in the light of new exchange rates and inflation.&#13;

in detail.&#13;
N.F-A. = Not Financed by the Association&#13;
5.21     Goods. Goods financed by IDA under the program would include: essential drugs,&#13;
medical equipment and materials, vehicles, and office equipment and furniture for a total value&#13;
of US$5 million equivalent. Because of the current need to use drug kits for PHUs,&#13;
procurement of essential drugs for primary health care would be procured from UNICEF, for&#13;
drugs stocked by them, up to an aggregate of US$2 million. Approximately US$1.5 million&#13;
equivalent in pharmaceuticals would be procured through ICB, and another US$250,000&#13;
through international shopping for drugs estimated to cost less than US$25,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract in accordance with Bank Guidelines. In general, goods valued at US$250,000 or&#13;
more per contract would be procured through ICB. Goods estimated at less than US$250,000&#13;
per contract, and US$0.5 million in the aggregate, would be procured through national&#13;
competitive bidding (NCB) under procedures acceptable to IDA. The remaining goods which&#13;
cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least US$25,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$250,000 would be procured by national shopping up to an aggregate of US$100,00&#13;
equivalent, or by international shopping up to an aggregate of US$150,000 according to Bank&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
5.22 Services. Consultants financed by IDA would be contracted in accordance with IDA's,&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). The consultancy services required under the&#13;
project would be mostly for project management, supervision and implementation, architectural&#13;
and engineering services, and for training activities. It would include, specifically, the services of&#13;
locally recruited consultants and training institutions to carry out activities such as: (a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
procurement agents; (b) quantity surveyors and building technicians; (c) annual program audits;&#13;
(d) training of DOH and District staff; and (e) preparation of training and [EC materials. Training&#13;
institutions would be selected on the basis of a short-list and submitted proposals. Where specific&#13;
area of expertise is required intermittently over an extended period, contracts with international&#13;
universities or training institutions will be considered.&#13;
5.23    Procurement arrangements. The procurement activities of the program financed&#13;
by IDA will be straightforward. The construction and rehabilitation works will be supervised&#13;
by project engineers and final payment will be made to contractors only when the work is&#13;
complete according to specifications. The procurement will be carried out by staff who have&#13;
procurement experience under the ongoing IDA-assisted project, who will be assigned to the&#13;
new Procurement Services Unit of the DOH (under the Management Services Division), with&#13;
additional technical assistance support. The Unit will be staffed with professional purchasing&#13;
and stores personnel and utilize improved procurement management systems, covering both&#13;
Govemment and donor procurement procedures. Although the DOH Management Team will&#13;
be responsible for the oversight of the administrative and contractual arrangements of the&#13;
program, the Management Support Officer will liaise closely with the Procurement Services&#13;
Unit for handling all matters related to the preparation, implementation and monitoring of&#13;
work plans for the smooth execution of procurement of all works, goods, and services,&#13;
including the preparation of bidding documents, launching of tenders, evaluation, and&#13;
reporting the results to the Government and to IDA for review. In addition, adequate records&#13;
on procurement progress, including staff reports on site visits, the timing of works and goods&#13;
procurement; and compliance with agreed methods of procurement will be maintained by the&#13;
Procurement Services Unit. These will be used in DOH's program monitoring system.&#13;
Commitment to following a generic timetable for the detailed steps of the different&#13;
procurement activities were agreed at negotiations (para. 7.1 (f)).&#13;
5.24    Bank review. Prior review by IDA would be required for procurement of packages&#13;
of works and goods which exceed US$100,000. Procurement documentation and&#13;
arrangements for each consultant contract valued at US$100,000 or more for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 or more for individuals would be subject to prior review by IDA. However, the&#13;
exceptions to prior IDA review would not apply to (a) the terms of reference for such&#13;
contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a critical nature,&#13;
as reasonably determined by the Association; (d) amendments to contracts for the employment&#13;
of consulting firms raising the contracts value to US$100,000 equivalent or above; or (e)&#13;
amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants raising the contract&#13;
value to US$50,000 equivalent or above. All bidding documents will be prepared using the&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for each type of ICB procurement which will be&#13;
submitted to IDA for review and approval. Submission to IDA of finalized first year bidding&#13;
documents for civil works and goods for the Western Region-to be financed by IDA-to be&#13;
procured through international competitive bidding would be a condition of effectiveness&#13;
(para. 7.3 (e)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
H. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
5.25     In accordance with the NHAP, the Credit is expected to be completed within a five-&#13;
year period by December 31, 2000 (completion date), with all disbursements made by June 30,&#13;
2001 (closing date). Although the program is expected to be implemented with considerable&#13;
difficulty because of the enormous challenges faced by the DOH, successful disbursement is&#13;
anticipated because of (a) the considerable time and resources invested in preparation and&#13;
planning; (b) the high degree of Government ownership and commitment to the program&#13;
developed through the preparation process; (c) the strengthening of DOH capacity by staffing&#13;
of key positions and support by local and international consultants; and (d) the use of training&#13;
and technical assistance in financial management. There is limited Regional experience in the&#13;
disbursement of integrated sector-wide programs. The funds for this operation are forecast to&#13;
disburse at a faster rate than the Regional profile because the operation is equivalent to the&#13;
DOH program, and cannot be marginalized, and because of the up-front preparation and&#13;
systematic review of program implementation. The estimated disbursement schedule is given&#13;
in Annex 16.&#13;
5.26     The following table gives the categories and amounts to be financed out of the IDA&#13;
Credit, and the percentage to be financed in each category.&#13;
Table 5.2 Allocation and Disbursement of the IDA Credit (US$ million)&#13;
1. Civil works                                     6.3     100% of foreign expenditures&#13;
90% of local expenditures&#13;
2. Drugs, furniture, equipment, vehicles, supplies  4.3     100% of foreign expenditures&#13;
and spare parts                                         90% of local expenditures&#13;
3. Technical assistance and studies                2.1      100% of expenditures&#13;
4. Training, including training materials          3.0      100% of expenditures&#13;
5. Incremental operating costs'                    1.7      100% of foreign expenditures;&#13;
90% of local expenditures until&#13;
December 31, 1998; then, 75%&#13;
of local expenditures&#13;
6. Refunding of Project Preparation Advance        0.3      100%&#13;
7. Unallocated                                     2.3&#13;
Total credit amount                           20.0&#13;
These include: incremental administrative and rnnning costs of districts, the DOH Management Team, the PMISU,&#13;
the Management Support Office, the Financial Management Unit, and the Procurement Unit, such as salaries for&#13;
incremental staff positions, per diems, travel costs, general office supplies, fuel, vehicle and equipment maintenance costs,&#13;
and other administrative expenses.&#13;
5.27     Disbursement and withdrawal procedures are detailed in The World Bank&#13;
DisbursementHandbook (1992 edition). All disbursements are subject to the conditions of the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement and the procedures defined in the Disbursement Letter. The&#13;
Operational Manual will further outline what individual managers need to do to spend and&#13;
account for money under their authority.&#13;
5.28     Special Account. To facilitate disbursements of eligible expenditures for works,&#13;
goods and services, the Government would open a Special Account in a commercial bank to&#13;
cover part of IDA's share of eligible expenditures to be managed and administered by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
DOH. The authorized allocation for the Special Account would be US$1 million covering an&#13;
estimated four months of eligible expenditures financed by IDA. Upon effectiveness, 500/o of&#13;
the authorized allocations amounting to US$500,000 would be deposited to the Special&#13;
Account. The remaining balance will be made available as needed. Monthly replenishment&#13;
requests would be fully documented except for contracts for civil works, goods and consulting&#13;
firms below US$100,000 equivalent, and for contracts for services from individuals below&#13;
US$50,000, and all incremental operating costs, which may be claimed on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Documentation would be retained by DOH for review by&#13;
regular IDA supervision missions and the external auditors. Replenishment requests would be&#13;
accompanied by up-to-date bank statements and reconciliations of the Special Account. All&#13;
payments under US$50,000 equivalent must be made through the Special Account; payments&#13;
above that amount may be made through direct payment or special commitment procedures.&#13;
All direct-IDA payments must be according to the procedures set out in The World Bank&#13;
Disbursement Handbook (1992 edition). Funds in the Special Account cannot be mixed with&#13;
other funds (such as funds from Government sources or other donors).&#13;
5.29    Government financing. Government financial contribution to the health sector&#13;
would be monitored through the accounting system being established with the assistance of an&#13;
auditor and with the Department of Finance (DOF). As a condition of effectiveness, the&#13;
Government would sign a contract for (i) the installation in the system of an accounting&#13;
software for the DOH's programs, and (ii) the training of DOH's staff in the use of the said&#13;
system (para. 7.3(f)). The DOF would be required to make quarterly allocations to the DOH&#13;
on the basis of an agreed budget for the program, proposed by Government, and accepted by&#13;
IDA one month before the beginning of each fiscal year.&#13;
L. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, AND REPORTING&#13;
5.30  Overall responsibility for the project's financial management would rest with the&#13;
Financial Management Division of the DOH, which would maintain the consolidated Program&#13;
Accounts for the entire program. To improve Government's coordination of donor funds and&#13;
to ensure transparency for the entire program, accounting for all transactions of the Program&#13;
Accounts, including Government funds, the IDA Special Account, and funds from other&#13;
donors, would be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual&#13;
financial statements of Government and all donor finances would be prepared and audited in&#13;
accordance with international auditing guidelines. By June 30th of each year, the&#13;
implementing agency would submit to IDA and other donors an auditor's report, management&#13;
report and audited financial statements for the Program Accounts, the Special Account, and&#13;
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for the preceding fiscal year, audited by an independent&#13;
expert under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. Therefore, the appointment of an&#13;
independent auditor will be crucial,and it would be a condition of credit effectiveness (para.&#13;
7.3(g)), the Government will have issued the letter of invitation satisfactory to IDA for the&#13;
employment of an independent auditor to audit the expenditures financed from proceeds of the&#13;
proposed Credit. The audit of Credit 1695-SL implemented by the DOH is current.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VI. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. PROGRAM BENEFITS&#13;
6.1    Implementation of the program will enable the Government to attain its sector goals,&#13;
offering Sierra Leoneans more access to health services of better quality, and will ultimately&#13;
lead to, through its emphasis on primary health care, improved health status of the population&#13;
with emphasis on the poor, women and children. The main benefits of the project would be to:&#13;
(a) reduce excessive morbidity, mortality, and fertility through extension of basic quality&#13;
health and family planning services to those most in need; (b) implement a comprehensive&#13;
reform of the health sector aiming at directing resources to those priority health problems for&#13;
which cost-effective intervention strategies are available; (c) strengthen the capacity of central&#13;
DOH to use resources in an efficient manner; (d) develop sector capacity in areas such as&#13;
management, financial management, human resources development and planning; (e)&#13;
decentralize decision-making, and enable communities and districts to make decisions and to&#13;
have greater control over budget and service delivery; and (f) diversify the financing of health&#13;
services and help establish a more equitable and affordable basis for it.&#13;
B. PROGRAM RISKS&#13;
6.2    There are a number of potential risks, most notably: (a) the persistence of-or late&#13;
solution to-the security situation, which multiplies health emergencies, makes rehabilitation&#13;
in parts of the country untenable, and increases the possibility of not obtaining sufficient&#13;
domestic resources to implement the NHAP; (b) an over-ambitious program, which over-&#13;
stretches the implementation capacity of the DOH, could lead to weak efficiency gains and&#13;
donor skepticism concerning GOSL potential to coordinate and implement its policy, and; (c)&#13;
moving too quickly, before the reorganization of the DOH and the strengthening of its key&#13;
units are completed, could lead to a decline in efficiency, further dysfunction and distortions in&#13;
the provision of health services, and the inability to use national- and donor-contributed funds.&#13;
6.3   The risks are minimized by implementing the program in phases, starting physical&#13;
rehabilitation in areas free from civil unrest (e.g., Western Area). The sector investment&#13;
approach is also appropriate in these circumstances, as it allows a greater deal of flexibility in&#13;
program planning, enabling quick response to changing situations. The development phases&#13;
are also planned according to the growing capacity of Govemment, investing heavily on&#13;
training, support systems, and studies, using pilot initiatives, and reviewing progress&#13;
frequently, to minimize the risk of moving too quickly with institutional reform. Particular&#13;
emphasis on financial management, accounting and controls will help to ensure that allocated&#13;
funds are used for intended purposes in the health sector. The risks are further diminished&#13;
because there has been a comprehensive effort to examine organizational needs and&#13;
capabilities, incentives, and institutional culture, and to involve a wide number of Government&#13;
participants in the reform process. Decentralization of authority will be accompanied by&#13;
appropriate financial support and intensive training in management systems. Annual reviews&#13;
undertaken jointly by the Government, IDA, and other donors will enable Government to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
make required changes in programming strategies on a frequent basis. A mid-term review will&#13;
provide an opportunity for major restructuring, and cancellation, if necessary. Efforts to&#13;
increase participation with other Government Departments and stakeholders outside of the&#13;
Govemment should help to assure domestic support, and will diminish the risks due to political&#13;
instability, by developing a broad approval for the program and for the process of program&#13;
development and management. Finally, through the Bank's assistance by means of the&#13;
structural adjustment program, there is a consistent effort to maintain the commitment of the&#13;
Government to invest in social sectors.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS, CONDITIONS, AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1    During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it will:&#13;
(a)  give budgetary authority to implement a prepared district health plan to at least one&#13;
additional district in each year of the operation (para. 4.13);&#13;
(b) submit a three year rolling plan, an annual progress report, and a draft annual detailed&#13;
implementation plan and budget at least three months prior to the beginning of each&#13;
fiscal year, and prior to an annual Government-led meeting with donors, where&#13;
progress on the previous year's health program would be reviewed and specific&#13;
financing commitments made for the next year in advance of the submission of the&#13;

FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE&#13;
Februazy 5, 1996&#13;
Mr. James D. Wolfensobn&#13;
President&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
Washington, D.C.&#13;
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:&#13;
Sector Development Policy&#13;
I wish, on behalf of the Govemment and people of Sierra Leone, to thank the World Bank,&#13;
through you, for the assistance it has provided right from the start of the development of our National&#13;
Health Action Plan to tbis stage.&#13;
Over the last three years, our health sector in Sierra Leone has developed a policy, details of&#13;
which will be spelt out below.&#13;
Strting September 21-25, 1992, the Department convened a week-long seminar involving all&#13;
stakeholders in the health sector in Sierra Leone. It provided an open forum for a dialogue, assessment&#13;
of needs, people-centred prioritizafion, and for the creation of an atmosphere of cooperation between the&#13;
public, private and the private non-profit sectors, the health consumers and the international community.&#13;
The National Health Policy, which was the outcome of this exercise, was closely scrutinized and&#13;
finally accepted by Government in June 1993.&#13;
The policy mapped out a new direction for the health care system, focussing on the development&#13;
of preventive services whilst simultaneously strengthening the existing deivery system. The main&#13;
agenda for Government described in the National Health Policy is that:&#13;
(a) a network of sound primaiy, secondary, and tertiary health facilities will be strengthened&#13;
through rehabilitation, appropriate staffing and logistical support;&#13;
(b) environmental health and communicable disease control will be promoted;&#13;
(c) community participation and intersectoral cooperation will be fostered;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
(d)   health care delivery will be decentralized to the district level;&#13;
(e)   Govemment financing of health care will increase;&#13;
(f)   certain services will be privatized, where appropriate; and&#13;
(g) cooperation with international agencies and NGOs will be promoted.&#13;
The Government's main health objectives and indicators for the nation are clearly stated in the&#13;
NHAP. In brief the main objectives are to: (a) improve child health; (b) improve matemal health; (c)&#13;
reduce fertility; (d) reduce the incidence and prevalence of communicable diseases and other common&#13;
ailments, including H1V; (e) reduce mental illness; (f) reduce injury and handicaps; (g) assure&#13;
satisfactory nutritional status; (h) reduce drug abuse; (i) improve living conditions; and 0) improve food&#13;
hygiene. The NHAP defines the main functions of the health sector, and identifies how each of its&#13;
programmes are designed to fulfill these functions and contribute to one or more of the nine population&#13;
impact objectives. Each programme within the NHAP has clear operational targets to be attained during&#13;
the next five years, which will contribute to achieving its main objectives. Fulfilling these objectives&#13;
would contribute to the social sustainability of the adjustment programme, and strengthen the human&#13;
resource base needed for the future growth of Sierra Leone.&#13;
In order to transform the Health Policy into action, the Department organized a participative&#13;
workshop, held from October 27-November 5, 1993, involving various stakeholders, including the other&#13;
sectoral Departments, non-governmental organizations and donor agencies. This analysed health&#13;
problems, determined objectives and formulated both technical and support programmes (Annex 1), in&#13;
an effort to develop a consensus around an effective health policy and planning process as a critical&#13;
means of increasing effectiveness and efficiency. The National Health Action Plan (NHAP) was&#13;
developed at the workshop.&#13;
The Action Plan (NHAP) envisaged a major reform and restructuring of the health sector,&#13;
resulting in: (1) a radical organizational change (2) substantial human resource development and&#13;
management; (3) rehabilitation of the health infrastructure, particularly in the rural areas; (4)&#13;
enhancement of community participation, as well as investment in support services and systems that&#13;
sustain operations; (5) district level decentralization, and; (6) integration of vertical health service&#13;
programmes to make public health care more responsive to community needs.&#13;
The following four, related issues are recognized as critical in the establishment of a foundation&#13;
for a sustainable, equitable, and efficient health care: (a) poor access to health care; (b) poor quality of&#13;
services; (c) poor management, inadequate community involvement and accountability; and (d)&#13;
insufficient health care financing. The net effect of the reform programme is expected to improve the&#13;
health status of the people of Sierra Leone, by increasing access to healthcare and improving quality of a&#13;
national package of health services that is better managed and financed through a progressively&#13;
decentralized system.&#13;
The total cost of these programmes is estimated at US$270 million over the period 19941999.&#13;
Comparing these estimates with projected Government and donor expenditure at current levels gives a&#13;
financing gap of US$184 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
In view of the magnitude of the fimding gap for the NHAP, the Department prepared a core&#13;
programme of high priority interventions and services for discussion with donors.&#13;
The core programme was developed by considering the highest priority programmes and,&#13;
therefore, represents a more modest version or subset of the NHAP. The total estimated cost of the core&#13;
programme is US$138.2 million (adjusted for physical and price contingencies). After taking account of&#13;
the current Govemment and donor support of US$86 million for the Health Sector, the financing gap is&#13;
estimated at US$52 million.&#13;
Of the funding gap for the core programme of US$52 million, it is estimated that an additional&#13;
US$26 million will be contributed by the Government and household sectors. The core programme wilL&#13;
therefore, require an incremental donor contribution of US$26 million.&#13;
It is recognised that the cost and financing totals are preliminary estimates requiring further&#13;
refinement through discussion with donors and other major stakeholders. In particular, the costs of&#13;
training, improved staff remuneration and decentralization need considerable further analysis. Periodic&#13;
review of programme expenditures and donor commitments is therefore envisaged.&#13;
It is recognized that the cost and financing totals are preliminary estimates, requiring further&#13;
refinement through discussion with donors and other major stakeholders. In particular, the costs of&#13;
training improved staff remuneration and decentralization need considerable further analysis. Periodic&#13;
review of program expenditures and donor commitments is therefore envisaged.&#13;
The provision of a more comprehensive, integrated and sustainable health care system is central&#13;
to the country's development strategy. The health system had deteriorated to such an extent that there is&#13;
a large financial and technical gap between what is currently available and what is needed to make it&#13;
work.&#13;
At the Social Sectors Round Table Consultations (May, 1994) the Department presented its&#13;
plans for the reform and restructuring of the health care system, with the objective of promoting dialogue&#13;
and fostering consensus among Govermnent, NGOS, the donor community and other key stakeholders,&#13;
and of generating support for the health sector reforms. Government was encouraged to make greater&#13;
use of NGOs and the enhanced role of the private sector in financing and health care delivery. NGO's&#13;
agreed to work fully within the framework of the NHAP and share their information and technical&#13;
capabilities with Govermment.&#13;
Participants applauded government's determination to decentralize the health care services at&#13;
district level and enhance accountability at both Headquarters and at the periphery.&#13;
Donors and NGOs agreed-inter alia-to: work exclusively within the framework of the National&#13;
Health Action Plan as much as possible, using common implementation modalities; participate with&#13;
Govermment in the joint review and planning process; provide financial and/or technical assistance in&#13;
support of the NHAP; meet the estimated funding gap in the NHAP; mobilize their resource&#13;
commitments for the NHAP; prepare their information requirements for discussion with Government;&#13;
adapt the scope and modalities of their development assistance to accord with the needs of the NHAP,&#13;
and; offer to redirect some existing projects' funds to finance some sharply-focussed, technical&#13;
assistance-both to yield demonstrable progress in the field and improve the efficiency of the Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
At the October 1995 Social Sectors Donors Meeting, donors and NGOs agreed to support the&#13;
incremental core program activities with an additional US$5.75 million for 1996.&#13;
Governmenfs commitment to the NHAP has been demonstrated by its acceptance of the&#13;
document, and its commitment to increase expenditure in the health sector by at least 5% per annum in&#13;
real terms over the duration of the NHAP. More recently, Govemment has agreed in principle to&#13;
authorize the Department of Health to have:&#13;
(a)  authority to decide programme, manpower and line item budgets, in relation to the core&#13;
programme, and wihiin an overall departmental ceiling provided by the Department of&#13;
Finance;&#13;
(b)  real influence over the recruitment and selection process, and the application of&#13;
employment practices for staff promotions, discipline and transfers, and;&#13;
(c)  authority to determine the numbers, categories, and skill mix of staff required in line with&#13;
an overall departmental manpower plan, as well as some discretion over individual's pay&#13;
within established salary structures.&#13;
An improved organizational structure of the Department has been developed and job&#13;
descriptions have been prepared to delegate authority from the Secretary of State to the central and&#13;
district levels of management as follows:&#13;
1.   Top Management Team&#13;
2.   Director-General of Medical Services&#13;
3 .   Director-General of Management Services&#13;
4.   Donor Relations&#13;
5.   Intemal Auditor&#13;
6.   Management Support Office&#13;
7.   Division Directors&#13;
8.   Unit Managers&#13;
9.   District Health Management Teams&#13;
10.  National Health Councils, District Health Boards and Hospital Management Committees&#13;
The process of reform has done much to energize the Department of Health and the people&#13;
associated with it. DOH staff have learned to work in teams to identify and solve problems, and&#13;
therefore communication and the effectiveness of the work of the DOH has improved. The reform&#13;
process has brought Department staff much closer to the users of the health system and to other&#13;
providers. Much of this is due to the preparation of the NHAP and the confidence they have gained from&#13;
the experience. This is one of the main reasons why the DOH was selected Governments most&#13;
productive Department.&#13;
The beneficiaries have been involved in the development of the National Health Policy and the&#13;
National Health Action Plan. They participated in a programme prioritization exercise, which identified&#13;
the core programmes of the NHAP, and they have indicated their commitment to the NHAP through&#13;
their willingness to pay for the improved services through user fees and the Bamako Initiative. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
beneficiary assessment was carried out to establish a baseline for the future analysis of the impact of&#13;
Government actions on health care. The finding that was specifically relevant and important to the&#13;
Department of Health was the thought that Government could help by providing roads, basic services&#13;
such as water, and improving literacy and increased economic activity.&#13;
The programmes are designed so that they will not be implemented vertically, but as part of a&#13;
package of essential health services. The district will become the focus of operational planning and&#13;
implementation. Following general guidance of the central DOH, the District Health Management&#13;
Teams (DHNT) will be responsible for planning and delivery of most elements of the six PHC services&#13;
in their own district. The operational details of how the specific services will be provided in each area&#13;
will be worked out in each district as part of their annual planning exercise, with the PHUs expected to&#13;
deliver much of the preventive and primary curative services. Each PHU will be linked to a district level&#13;
hospital which will provide first referral services. Larger hospitals will provide more of the same&#13;
services as the district hospitals, and also function as referral points for more specialized services&#13;
(tertiary health care services). The larger hospitals will be under the administration of newly created&#13;
hospital management committees.&#13;
The first year of the programme has been designed to set the foundation for the NHAP&#13;
implementation while addressing the current security situation. Detailed activities and budgets for the&#13;
first 18 months were prepared by the DOH staff for the entire programme, and are included in the DOH&#13;
Operational Manual. Since many of the districts are currently inaccessible, more central level planning&#13;
and irnplementation occurs in the first year. The emphasis on improving the ongoing service delivery&#13;
will focus on the Westem Area and the towns where the populations have concentrated. Matemal and&#13;
child health services, including family planning, obstetric, and well-child care, along with communicable&#13;
disease control, water and sanitation services, and nutrition take the majority of inputs for service&#13;
delivery. Emergency assistance for refugees is being handled separately from routine DOH activities,&#13;
under an umbrella organization in the Govemment. Implementation of the institutional changes in the&#13;
DOH is another highlight of the first year's plan. Staff have been reassigned to the new units of the&#13;
Department, but further work and support is planned for 1995/96 to get them fully functional. The key&#13;
areas include the establishment of the Financial Management Team, the Procurement Unit, the&#13;
Maintenance and Repair Unit, and a Donor Relations Secretariat. Human resources development will&#13;
comprise a major part of the first year: curricula at the training institutions will be revised, and the first&#13;
year of the new cadres of peripheral health staff is expected this year, while personnel systems will be set&#13;
up. Revising the health information system is also planned during the first year. Decentralization will be&#13;
implemented slowly during this year. The Western Area District Health Management Team has&#13;
developed its district plan, and will be given authority to implement the plan, including budgetary&#13;
allocations for non-wage recurrent expenditures. Rehabilitation will concentrate in the Westem Area.&#13;
Hospitals and PHUS, a maintenance facility, and a drug warehouse, all in the Westem Area, are&#13;
scheduled for rehabilitation in 1995/96. A health facilities infrastructure and equipment survey will be&#13;
extended in a phased manner to cover the remainder of the country, which will form the basis for specific&#13;
rehabilitation plans in the subsequent years. Pharmaceutical seed stocks (essential drugs, contraceptives,&#13;
vaccines, laboratory reagents) for PHUs and hospitals will also be purchased and distributed.&#13;
An annual review of the programme will be conducted jointly with the Govermment and the other&#13;
donors. This review will focus on the achievement of the immediate targets and indicators in the agreed&#13;
annual workplan, and the reasons for any under-achievement or variation. The approach of the review&#13;
would be forward looking, endeavouring to identify factors which are likely to affect progress in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

following year, and taking necessary steps to overcome these constraints in a timely manner or to amend&#13;
objectives in the light of changing circumstances.&#13;
The implementation of the findings of the annual review for the current years workplans would&#13;
also be examined. This workplan would subsequently be amended as appropriate, demonstrating the&#13;
flexibility of the NHAP implementation process.&#13;
The World Bank has funded the Health and Population Project (HPP) from which lessons have&#13;
been leamed. These will be useful in the implementation of the National Health Action Plan. One of the&#13;
challenges of the NHAP implementation will be to recognize, develop and apply local capacity to solve&#13;
health problems of the country.&#13;
The lack of coordination in the Health Sector has led to a fractionalised health system. The&#13;
National Health Action Plan seeks to ensure that donor support is focussed on the enhancement of the&#13;
objectives of the plan and so obviate the tendency to run separate projects.&#13;
Additional recent information about our programme, is provided in the draft Implementation&#13;
Manual, a copy of which is being transmitted to you.&#13;
We thank you profoundly for the Bank's cooperation in our efforts to provide better health care&#13;
for our people.&#13;
With best regards.&#13;
Yours sincerely,&#13;
Dr. S.U.M. Jah&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT&#13;
Communique of the&#13;
Social Sectors Round Table Consultations&#13;
Freetown, Sierra Leone&#13;
May 17 to 20, 1994&#13;
1.    The Social Sectors Round Table was officially opened by His Excellency the Chairman,&#13;
National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) and Head of State, Captain Valentine E M Strasser&#13;
thereby demonstrating Government's firm commitment to social sector reform with the objective&#13;
of raising the level of human development.&#13;
The National Action Plans&#13;
2.    The Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) presented National Action Plans for the&#13;
Education and Health Sectors at a UNDP sponsored Social Sectors Round Table convened in&#13;
Freetown from May 17 to 20, 1994. Its purpose was to promote dialogue and to foster&#13;
consensus among Government, NGOs, the donor community and other key stakeholders, and to&#13;
generate support for the Government's health and education sectors reform programmes.&#13;
3.    The National Education Action Plan (NEAP), underpinning the recently introduced 6-3-3-&#13;
4 Education Reform, is to improve quality and quantity of basic education and technical training&#13;
system. NEAP focuses on three main priorities: primary and junior secondary level education,&#13;
both formal and non-formal; enhancing the management and administration of the education&#13;
system, especially increasing decision making powers at the local level; and training of education&#13;
sector personnel.&#13;
4.    The core program of the National Health Action Plan (NHAP) is a comprehensive&#13;
framework of technical and support services emphasizing primary health and supportive hospital&#13;
services to improve access and quality of care. The main priorities are maternal and child health&#13;
care, water and sanitation, and health education, whilst strengthening the sector's management,&#13;
human resources and maintenance functions.&#13;
5.    Taking into account likely financial constraints and implementation capacity, these six-year&#13;
plans aim for effective, efficient, and sustainable provision of services. Equitable treatment for&#13;
under-served groups - notably women, girls and the rural poor - are hallmarks of the plans. The&#13;
special needs of education and health services in the war affected areas were recognized and will&#13;
be addressed as soon as the security situation allows.&#13;
6.    The compelling economic and humanitarian rationale for immediate implementation of the&#13;
social sector reform agenda has led GOSL to move boldly on two fronts: delivering benefits to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
individuals and communities while at the same time building institutional capacity to implement,&#13;
absorb and sustain massive reform.&#13;
Discussions&#13;
7.    Donors responded by congratulating Government on its initiative in requesting the first&#13;
ever Round Table on the social sectors. Endorsement was given to the highly participatory&#13;
process used to formulate and prioritize the Action Plans, which has resulted in strong local&#13;
ownership and commitment.&#13;
8.    The sector program approach - the conceptual framework for the Plans - was commended&#13;
for its potential to: harmonize sectoral development with macro-economic policy adjustment;&#13;
integrate ongoing and projected activities whether domestically or externally financed; respond to&#13;
unforeseen circumstances while maintaining direction and cohesiveness; facilitate Government&#13;
coordination of donor and NGO assistance; and generally maximize developmental impact. It&#13;
also enables donors to provide their assistance to specific components, geographic areas, as well&#13;
as to broader program support.&#13;
9.    The importance of increasing authority and responsibility for delivering education and&#13;
health services at district level was a central feature of both plans. Donors applauded&#13;
Government's determination to decentralize operations and to enhance accountability at both&#13;
headquarters and in the field.&#13;
10.   Emphasis was placed on the need for enhanced coordination within each Department, and&#13;
between these line departments and the central coordinating agencies of Government. This&#13;
includes the establishment of an aid coordination unit in the Department of Development and&#13;
Economic Planning (DODEP).&#13;
11.   Donors concurred with Government that achievement of ultimate objectives would be best&#13;
assured through periodic review and updating.&#13;
12.   Donors responded enthusiastically and practically to GOSL's courageous strategy of&#13;
simultaneously getting results on the ground and strengthening the institutional base.&#13;
13.   Donors and NGOs offered to redirect some existing project funds and to finance some&#13;
sharply focused technical assistance both to yield demonstrable progress in the field and to&#13;
improve the efficiency of Department of Education (DOE) and Department of Health and Social&#13;
Services (DOHSS) headquarters and district administrations.&#13;
14.   Government was also encouraged to investigate greater use of NGOs and enhanced role&#13;
for the private sector in financing and delivery of education and health care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;

development and utilization and program sustainability;&#13;
*     follow up with donors to ascertain what is needed to realize their full support;&#13;
*     develop a detailed schedule for preparation of the sector programmes, and distribute&#13;
this to donors within the next month; and&#13;
*     produce a status report on the programmes, including donor commitment, by the next&#13;
Consultative Group Meeting in 1995.&#13;
19.   NGOs will:&#13;
*     provide information to Government on their current and proposed activities; and&#13;
*     adapt their existing development assistance to accord with NEAP and NHAP.&#13;
20.   Donors will:&#13;
prepare their information requirements to discuss with Government;&#13;
adapt the scope and modalities of their development assistance to accord with the&#13;
needs of the NEAP and NHAP; and&#13;
*     mobilize their resource commitments for the NEAP and NHAP.&#13;
21.   In light of the success of this meeting, it was proposed to reconvene a follow-up Round&#13;
Table Consultation on the Social Sectors in 18 months, within the wider context of poverty&#13;
alleviation.&#13;

COMMUNIQUE&#13;
SOCIAL SECTOR DONORS MEETING&#13;
BINTUMANI HOTEL&#13;
16 - 18 OCTOBER, 1995&#13;
1.    The Social Sectors Donors Meeting, a follow up of the May, 1994, Social Sectors Round&#13;
Table Consultations was officially opened by His Excellency Captain Valentine E.M. Strasser,&#13;
Head of State and Chairman of the National Provisional Ruling Council thereby giving credence&#13;
to Governments strong commitment to Social Sectors reform.&#13;
2.    Sierra Leone Government reported on progress, in the Education and Health Sectors, on&#13;
the understandings and agreements reached at the May, 1994, Consultations.&#13;
3.    The National Education Sector Policy and Priorities were presented:&#13;
4.The Health Sector Priority activities and incremental costs for Fiscal Year 1996 (For Western&#13;
Area District and Central Level Program) activities; budgets; implementation arrangements and&#13;
monitoring indicators.&#13;
5.Government of Sierra Leone is strongly committed to Social Sectors reform including the&#13;
process of democratization already started and which will be leading to the reactivation, of the&#13;
district councils, which will give the districts the authority to plan, implement and monitor their&#13;
respective Health and Education programmes.&#13;
6.Government increased its financial allocation to the Health and Education Sectors by at least&#13;
5% per annum in real terms, with effect from the 1994/95 fiscal year; the increases will be&#13;
sustained over the life span of the Health and Education Action Plans.&#13;
7.The Education and Health Sector have benefited from the Social Action and Poverty Alleviation&#13;
(SAPA) activities; School rehabilitation; pedagogical material and equipment; hospital and health&#13;
center refurbishment; supply of essential drugs on a cost recovery basis and the supply of basic&#13;
equipment.&#13;
8.    Government highlighted its commitment to address the special and dire needs of the&#13;
education and health sectors affected by the rebel war which has a devastating effect on the&#13;
sources of Government revenue through the disruption of economic activities.&#13;
9.    Government agrees to convene a similar Social Sector Donors Meeting each year of&#13;
NHAP and NEAP Implementation to appraise Donors and NGOs of progress made to present&#13;
sector plans and Budgets for the following year, and to encourage continued commitment and&#13;
support to the implementation of the two national plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;

IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
Donors and NGOs:&#13;
1.    Commended the DOE on progress made since the last Donors Round Table for the social&#13;
sector in May 1994. They recognized the significant effort involved in the production of&#13;
the new education sector policy and the difficulties the DOE has faced over the last 18&#13;
months in responding to the emergency needs of the displaced school-aged population.&#13;
2.    Appreciate the steps which have been taken thus far towards the restructuring the central&#13;
administration of the DOE, and recognize that initial steps have been taken to review the&#13;
National Education Plan and Policy and to improve efficiency in the tertiary sector.&#13;
3.    Also appreciate that further work is needed in relation to prioritization, phasing and&#13;
detailed costing in order to operationalize the new education policy. A master plan which&#13;
will be completed by 1996 will serve as the basis for medium-term coordination and&#13;
cooperation with donors.&#13;
4.    Are in full agreement with the priority for improving both the quality of, and access to,&#13;
basic education, (formal and non-formal) paying particular attention to the needs of girls'&#13;
disabled and disadvantaged and gifted. They would wish to emphasize the importance of&#13;
quality primary education as a prerequisite for the successful development of quality&#13;
education thereafter.&#13;
5.    Recognized the positive role of the DOE during the last 18 months in ensuring&#13;
coordination of donor contributions but would stress the need for further attention to&#13;
developing this partnership.&#13;
6.    Recognized that central to the implementation of the whole new education policy is the&#13;
efficient management of the teacher resource; donors support the establishment of a&#13;
teaching service commission, the continuing professional development of teachers, and&#13;
control of the payroll.&#13;
IN THE HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
Donors and NGOs commended the Department of Health on the progress made on the&#13;
initiative in convening this Meeting as a follow up to the Social Sectors Roundtable Consultations&#13;
of May 1994. The participants congratulated the DOH on the quality of work which has gone&#13;
into the preparation of the working documents including the detailed plans and budgets for&#13;
Western Area District activities, Central Program support activities, and the Estimates of&#13;
Resource Requirements for 1996, as well as other supporting documentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
Donors and NGOs praised the efforts of the Government in restructuring the Department,&#13;
strengthening management capabilities, and in the progress made in the decentralization of health&#13;
care management and delivery. Participants also applauded Government in setting up a central aid&#13;
coordination unit in the Department of Development and Economic Planning and also the&#13;
Department of Health for putting in place a Donor Coordination Secretariat.&#13;
Donors and NGOs:&#13;
1.    agreed with the Government's efforts to continue health care throughout the country, with&#13;
special emphasis on districts with influx of the displaced, while emphasizing key&#13;
investment at central level and in the Western Area as the foundation for extension into&#13;
the areas of the country in subsequent years.&#13;
2.    restated their commitment to work within the framework of the NHAP, and recognized&#13;
the important role of DOH in managing the process of overall planning for the sector.&#13;
Notwithstanding this, participants also encouraged the Department to continue with its&#13;
efforts build capacity at both central and district levels needed for the efficient&#13;
implementation of the NHAP.&#13;
3.    noted the excellent working relationship enjoyed with the Department and suggested that&#13;
continued dialogue and consultations between DOH and partners in the health sector be&#13;
held periodically.&#13;
During discussions, donors and NGOs also highlighted the need for information sharing&#13;
and joint program review with a view to maximize use of resources.&#13;
Recognizing the health needs of the country and the commitment on the part of&#13;
Government to share the cost of implementing the NHAP, donors and NGOs indicated that, they&#13;
would continue their current support to the overall health sector prograrn including the emergency&#13;
activities, at the minimum amount of US$6.9 million. An additional US$5.75 million minimum&#13;
was committed in support of the incremental core program activities for 1996. Assuming that the&#13;
overall core NHAP Program will cost approximately US$24 million for 1996 and that&#13;
Government will contribute approximately US$7 million; a projected gap of at least US$4.5&#13;
million still exists. Government will take steps to fill this financing gap through discussion with&#13;
donors, NGOs and its other partners in the health sector. To this end, those unable to quantify&#13;
their organizations' contributions to NHAP implementation, committed themselves to provide the&#13;
finical information to the DOH as soon as available.&#13;
In conclusion, the donors and NGOs reiterated their support for the Departments efforts&#13;
and in the implementation of the NHAP.&#13;
The meeting was attended by representatives from the United Kingdom, United States of&#13;
America, European Union, United Nations Development Program, United Nations Children's&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis and Framework for Prioritization of the Core Program of the National&#13;
Health Action Plan (NHAP)&#13;
This analysis of the Integrated Health Sector Investment Project (IHSIP) is based on the&#13;
public expenditure reviewl and the health sector policy (NHAP core program), and takes into&#13;
account existing resource constraints.&#13;
The Sector Investment Approach (SIP) does not lend itself to assessing the rate of return&#13;
of the IHSIP because: (i) the IDA level of funding and the breakdown by expenditure categories&#13;
are to be determined on an annual basis; and (ii) IDA funds are fungible and will be used as a&#13;
last resort source of financing. It is therefore not feasible to prospectively quantify project costs&#13;
and benefits. For this reason, a detailed analysis of the soundness of the entire national sector&#13;
investment program, as presented in the sector policy (NHAP core program), was carried out.&#13;
Sector-wide review of public expenditures&#13;
Focus on service provision. The review of public expenditures has focused on restoring&#13;
the GOSL's capacity to provide basic services, specifically in the health and education sectors.2&#13;
Consequently, DOH has developed its health sector strategy-as presented in the NHAP-in the&#13;
general frame and constraints offered by the review. As a result, the sector refocused its plans&#13;
giving greater emphasis to cost-effective interventions, such as preventive and curative primary&#13;
health services, and abandoned efforts to establish a new tertiary facility in the form of a&#13;
teaching hospital at Jui near the capital Freetown. Efforts have been stepped up to diversify the&#13;
funding of the public health sector and to increase private health care provision by actively&#13;
facilitating NGO activities3 and by starting privatization of tertiary services4.&#13;
The status-quo alternative (i.e. no change in Government intervention and donor&#13;
support). Regarding the provision of preventive services, such as immunization or vector&#13;

11371-SL.&#13;
3 In early 1995, the DOH established a donor liaison office. It is now actively assisting a local foundation in the construction&#13;
of a new 56-bed hospital near Freetown by facilitating duty-free status and expediting customs and other administrative&#13;
procedures. DOH is liaising with all NGOs in order to avoid overlap and duplication by the public sector in the provision&#13;
of health care services.&#13;
4 A portion of the Connaught Hospital, termed the "Annex," is providing above-standard services (higher staff/client ratio,&#13;
air-conditioning, better food, etc.) and is now financed by collecting increased fees.&#13;
&#13;

recognized. With regard to primary health care and related referral services, a good case can be&#13;
made for the public provision of these services, especially at the outreach, on the basis of market&#13;
failures. It is reasonable to assume that maintaining the status quo in the sector would result in a&#13;
further deterioration of the already poor provision of health services to the general public: (a)&#13;
consumers in rural areas would not gain access to acceptable health services; (b) the overall&#13;
quality of health services, particularly at primary level, would remain low; (c) the lack of&#13;
information would continue to hamper rational decision-making by consumers; (d) expenditures&#13;
by private households on traditional healers and drug peddlers could not be recouped in favor of&#13;
better services; and (e) preventive services such as immunization or vector control would continue&#13;
to be supplied below optimal levels.&#13;
Macroeconomic environment&#13;
Budgetary impact. The Project's program evaluation and programming cycle&#13;
incorporates a mechanism, on an annual basis, to review together with Government of Sierra&#13;
Leone (GOSL) and other donors not only the IHSIP performance but the entire sector program-&#13;
under the leadership of GOSL- and to coordinate both recurrent and investment health&#13;
expenditures with the Government's overall budget. The project therefore will facilitate macro-&#13;
economic stability while at the same time contributing to the gains in the sector and to the&#13;
achievement of a reasonable level and composition of health expenditures (see figures 2.2 and 2.3&#13;
in the SAR).&#13;
Marginal cost of funds. No country-specific estimate for the marginal cost of public&#13;
funds is available. However, to overcome existing data limitations, the GOSL has committed&#13;
itself during Negotiations to conduct a national survey on household expenditures and household&#13;
economic activities, and to develop a comprehensive health sector financing plan latest by the end&#13;
of 1997, addressing the question of the public/private mix of services and diversification of sector&#13;
financing. Given that there is a premium on public income (since, generally speaking,&#13;
governments resort to distortionary taxation for revenue) and in order to ensure sustainability of&#13;
the health sector reform, the GOSL in the context of the IHSIP intends to upgrade and streamline&#13;
various existing cost recovery measures into a more coherent and efficient system.&#13;
Cost effectiveness&#13;
No specific data are available for Sierra Leone regarding the distribution of deaths by&#13;
specific cause, age and sex. However, it can be assumed that the country's mortality pattern&#13;
follows the model used for sub-Saharan Africa, as it is the case in neighboring Guinea for which&#13;
preliminary data exist from an ongoing study. Similarly, intervention costs have been estimated&#13;
from NHAP costs, literature and ongoing studies.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE&#13;
INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT&#13;
Detailed Description of Technical and Support Programs&#13;
1.    This description of the technical and support programs of the National Health Action Plan&#13;
(NHAP) is adapted from the Social Sectors Round Table document "Towards Better Health in&#13;
Sierra Leone: A Proposal for Financial Assistance from The International Community". This&#13;
description identifies differences between the total NHAP and the core program developed in&#13;
March 1994, and projects costs for the first five years of implementation. Further detailed&#13;
descriptions are found in an Annex to the Social Sectors Round Table document, and in the&#13;
NHAP itself The programs are as follow:&#13;
Technical Programs&#13;
Primary Health Care&#13;
1 - Maternal and Child Health&#13;
2 - Treatment of Common Ailments&#13;
3 - Control of Communicable Diseases&#13;
4 - Sanitation and Safe Water&#13;
5 - Nutrition&#13;
6 - Health Education/Communication&#13;
7 - Secondary Health Care&#13;
8 - Tertiary Health Care&#13;
Support Programs&#13;
1 - Drugs and Medical Supplies&#13;
2 - National Food, Environment and Clinical Laboratory Service&#13;
3 - Maintenance and Repair&#13;
4 - Human Resource Management&#13;
5 - Planning, Monitoring, Information and Statistics Unit&#13;
6 - Central Administration&#13;
Primary Health Care Programs&#13;
2.    The objectives and services for each of the six primary health care programs are described&#13;
in paragraphs 5-23 below. These programs will be implemented through a strengthened primary&#13;
health care delivery system. There may appear to be some overlap in the definition of programs;&#13;
this does not occur in practice at the district level, since the package of services will be delivered&#13;
through the same personnel. Successful implementation will depend on an implementation&#13;
strategy which emphasizes the:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
(a)   revitalization of health centers and district hospitals, and the effective operation of&#13;
District Health Management Teams;&#13;
(b)   gradual conversion of PHU staff to more multi-skilled health care personnel;&#13;
(c)   effective coordination with the private voluntary sector in respect to the design of&#13;
PHU staff training, the establishment of service standards, and monitoring service&#13;
delivery throughout the country;&#13;
(d)   establishment of guidelines for specific services and staff training;&#13;
(e)   elimination of "vertical" programs; and&#13;
(f)   sensitization and mobilization of communities for improved health care.&#13;
3.    Successful implementation also depends upon the effective integration of health education&#13;
with the other technical programs and the establishment of close links with the Department of&#13;
Education to expand school health education.&#13;
4.    The key elements of improved primary health care delivery are:&#13;
(a)   improved performance of front-line staff, in particular, TBAs, midwives, MCH&#13;
Aides, through training and the provision of drugs, equipment and support&#13;
services;&#13;
(b)   increased service coverage and improved service quality; and&#13;
(c)   behavioral change at the community level.&#13;
Technical Program 1: Maternal and Child Health&#13;
5.    Deplorable child health and poor maternal health are amongst the most pressing health&#13;
problems facing Sierra Leone. The Maternal and Child Health (MCH) program addresses the&#13;
objectives of reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality, and focuses on six key services&#13;
as follow:&#13;
(a)   antenatal care, safe delivery, post-natal care;&#13;
(b)   family planning;&#13;
(c)   school health services;&#13;
(d)   oral rehydration therapy (diarrhea control);&#13;
(e)   growth monitoring and promotion; and&#13;
(f)   breast feeding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
6.    All of these services are incorporated in the core program which is estimated to cost $10.0&#13;
million before contingencies. Given existing Government and donor commitments to MCH, the&#13;
incremental costs of the MCH core program are estimated at $3.2 million.&#13;
7.    The key weaknesses in the current MCH program which need to be addressed relate to&#13;
poor service coverage at community level, in particular growth monitoring, family planning and&#13;
school health services.&#13;
Technical Program 2: Treatment of Common Ailments&#13;
8.    Common ailments in Sierra Leone include those with high prevalence, such as malaria,&#13;
helminths, STDs and injuries. The objective is to reduce the general levels of illness and death by&#13;
improving diagnosis and treatment at PHUs. Although there is no specific technical program,&#13;
there are a number of services which contribute to this objective as follow:&#13;
(a)   clinical diagnosis, treatment and referral;&#13;
(b)   the provision of essential drugs;&#13;
(c)   first aid for injuries;&#13;
(e)   education on food selection and drug abuse;&#13;
(f)   distribution of food supplements;&#13;
(g)   programs to reduce drug abuse; and&#13;
(h)   public and patient information services.&#13;
9.    The core program includes:&#13;
(a)   the treatment and referral of basic trauma, malaria, diarrhea and local infections;&#13;
(b)   assessment and advice on the alleviation of pain, and the treatment of infection and&#13;
minor trauma;&#13;
(c)   the provision of drugs and supplies;&#13;
(d)   education on food selection and preparation; and&#13;
(e)   public and patient information services.&#13;
10.   The total cost of the core program for common ailments is estimnated at $15.6 million&#13;
before contingencies. The incremental costs requiring funding are estimated at $8.8 million.&#13;
11.   One key issue is the potential overlap with other programs, such as nutrition and health&#13;
education, which could result in a waste of resources.&#13;
Technical Program 3: Control of Communicable Diseases&#13;
12.   The control of communicable diseases covers some of the most severe health problems in&#13;
Sierra Leone, specifically, tuberculosis, measles, polio, tetanus and pertussis. The overall&#13;
objective of this program is to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in infants and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX S&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
children under-five. In order to achieve this objective, the NHAP envisages a comprehensive&#13;
approach to CDC which incorporates immunization, curative and preventive services.&#13;
13.   All preventive services in the NHAP are included in the core program, all immunization&#13;
services except rabies and meningitis, and all curative services excluding leprosy. In addition, the&#13;
core program explicitly adds AIDS and other STDs to the priority preventive services. The total&#13;
cost of the core CDC program is estimated at $11.6 million (before contingencies), with&#13;
incremental costs to be funded estimated at $3.0 million.&#13;
14.   Outstanding issues to be addressed include weaknesses in cold chain management and&#13;
coordination with NGOs active in CDC programs.&#13;
Technical Program 4: Sanitation and Safe Water&#13;
15.   Access to safe water and sanitation in Sierra Leone is very low, representing only 22%&#13;
and 35% of the rural population respectively. The overall objective of this program is to alleviate&#13;
the current unsanitary living conditions and reduce food contamination by improving access to&#13;
latrines and safe water.&#13;
16.   The NHAP sets out a comprehensive program for sanitation and safe water which&#13;
comprises well digging, latrine and toilet construction, and the extension and improvement of&#13;
piped water and sewage/solid waste disposal. Of these services, only well digging and latrine&#13;
construction are included in the priority core program as the remainder are the responsibility of&#13;
the Department of Works. The total costs of the core program are estimated at US$10.0 million&#13;
(before contingencies) and, of this amount, the incremental costs to be funded are estimated at&#13;
US$1.1 million.&#13;
17.   A key element of the program is the cooperation of various agencies, including NGOs, and&#13;
communities in expanded programs of well and latrine construction. The NHAP recognizes the&#13;
key role of communities in both the construction and maintenance of wells and latrines.&#13;
Accordingly, provision has been made to train village residents in well maintenance.&#13;
Technical Program 5: Nutrition and Dietetics&#13;
18.   The poor nutritional status of the population, particularly children, has been identified as a&#13;
major health problem in Sierra Leone. Studies show that malnutrition is a factor in more than one&#13;
third of infant and child deaths. Further, the poor quality and low quantity of food intake,&#13;
including breast milk, retards growth, reduces immunity, creates learning disabilities and&#13;
depresses work productivity. In order to address these problems, the main objective of the&#13;
overall NHAP program is to reduce the prevalence of childhood malnutrition by providing a&#13;
comprehensive range of services comprising:&#13;
(a)   nutrition education and rehabilitation;&#13;
(b)   food supplementation and fortification;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
(c)   diet therapy;&#13;
(d)   research; and&#13;
(e)   food control.&#13;
19.   The emphasis in the core program will be on nutrition education and rehabilitation, and&#13;
the provision of iodine micro-nutrients. The total cost of the core program is estimated at US$6.2&#13;
million (before contingencies), of which incremental costs to be financed amount to an estimated&#13;
US$1.0 million.&#13;
20.   Nutrition services will be provided through the PHU network and integrated with other&#13;
services at this level. One key element of this program, therefore, will be to increase the&#13;
performance of PHU staff to provide counseling, supplements and support services. Finally, one&#13;
outstanding issue is the need to develop a nutrition policy and convert this into a detailed plan.&#13;
Technical Program 6: Health Education and Communication&#13;
21.   Weaknesses in health education and communication are a key factor in many health&#13;
problems in Sierra Leone. This program, therefore, contributes to the effectiveness of the other&#13;
technical programs, although it currently lacks focus. The objective in the NHAP is to develop a&#13;
nationwide health education program which underpins the other technical programs. The NHAP&#13;
outlines a number of services in order to achieve this objective, as follow:&#13;
(a)   community health education;&#13;
(b)   production of printed materials;&#13;
(c)   drama presentations and songs;&#13;
(d)   mass media; and&#13;
(e)   school health education.&#13;
22.   All of these services have been included as a priority in the core program. The total costs&#13;
of the core program are estimated at US$4.0 million (before contingencies), of which US$0.5&#13;
million represents incremental expenditure to be funded.&#13;
23.   Outstanding issues which require urgent attention include the development of an IEC&#13;
strategy and the effective mobilization of community motivators and the communities with whom&#13;
they work.&#13;
Technical Program 7: Secondary Health Care&#13;
24.   Currently, district hospitals are providing very limited specialized care because of grossly&#13;
inadequate facilities, equipment, materials and inappropriately trained personnel. As a result,&#13;
hospitals have tended to focus on primary health care services. The main objective of secondary&#13;
health care, therefore, is to provide a referral service for the peripheral health units centered on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX S&#13;
Page 6 of 11&#13;
the district hospitals. The intention is for district hospitals also to play a role in monitoring and&#13;
following up patients who have been referred back to the PHUs after treatment.&#13;
25.   This program involves four health services under the NHAP, as follow:&#13;
(a)   hospital services;&#13;
(b)   mental health care;&#13;
(c)   drug information and poisoning services; and&#13;
(d)   disaster preparedness.&#13;
26.   The core program includes only the first of these services: emphasizing the provision of&#13;
basic in-patient care, some limited chronic care and curative care, and the treatment of&#13;
tuberculosis. The estimated cost of the core program is US$18.6 million (before contingencies),&#13;
with incremental costs to be financed estimated at US$3.5 million.&#13;
27.   The key elements of improved secondary health care include:&#13;
(a)   improved staff performance through training, better infrastructure, equipment and&#13;
support services;&#13;
(b)   the rehabilitation of district hospitals; and&#13;
(c)   strengthened district management.&#13;
28.   The secondary health care delivery system will be based on and around the district hospital&#13;
with a capacity of 40 beds or more, manned by at least 3 doctors. Each hospital wili be equipped&#13;
to handle basic medical and surgical emergencies and all routine clinical work. The district&#13;
hospital is also expected to improve the skills and services of the PHUs by referring patients home&#13;
for outpatient care.&#13;
29.   Successful implementation will depend on the rehabilitation of district hospitals, the&#13;
deployment of appropriate staff and improved management to ensure quality standards are&#13;
established and maintained.&#13;
30.   There are many outstanding issues which need to be resolved under secondary health care,&#13;
in particular:&#13;
(a)   attracting and retaining skilled personnel;&#13;
(b)   improved cost recovery through user fees and drug charges; and&#13;
(c)   the control of intra-mural private practice.&#13;
Technical Program 8: Tertiary Health Care&#13;
31.   Tertiary health care provides a higher level of specialized care and referrals from&#13;
secondary health care. Currently, however, the range of services offered is restricted by the lack&#13;
of working equipment and trained specialists. The NHAP set out plans to establish specialist&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
departments for pediatrics, surgery, opthalmology, cardiology and dentistry in the larger District&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
32.   None of the proposed services for tertiary care have been included under the priority core&#13;
program in order to ensure that additional resources are geared initially towards the basic health&#13;
needs of the population. Existing levels of expenditure will be maintained, but no incremental&#13;
expenditure is envisaged over the period of the plan.&#13;
33.   Nonetheless, it remains a priority to analyze the cost-benefit of different tertiary care&#13;
services to determine where existing resources are best allocated. In addition, because of the&#13;
relatively high costs of tertiary care, the potential for cost recovery needs to be urgently&#13;
addressed.&#13;
Support Program 1: Drugs and Medical Supplies&#13;
34.   The majority of the technical programs rely heavily on the provision of drugs and medical&#13;
supplies. However, the establishment of an efficient supply system is threatened by shortages of&#13;
essential drugs and a low cash recovery rate. The overall objective of this support program will&#13;
be to ensure that both essential and specialized drugs are widely available. In this regard, the&#13;
Government has established a list of essential drugs. Specialist drugs and supplies will be supplied&#13;
to secondary and tertiary care hospitals.&#13;
35.   The NHAP sets out a comprehensive approach to drugs and medical supplies including:&#13;
(a)   selection and quantification;&#13;
(b)   procurement, storage and distribution;&#13;
(c)   rational drug usage;&#13;
(d)   improved cost recovery;&#13;
(e)   quality control; and&#13;
(f)    drug regulation.&#13;
36.   All of these services are included in the core program, as well as a review of the potential&#13;
involvement of the private sector in marketing and distribution. The estimated cost of the core&#13;
program is US$11.8 million (before contingencies), giving an incremental cost to be financed of&#13;
US$5.3 million.&#13;
37.   The key elements of this support program are better availability of essential drugs,&#13;
improved cost recovery and the provision of trained staff at all levels. The successful&#13;
implementation of the drugs and medical supplies support program will require:&#13;
(a)   a revitalized procurement, storage and distribution system;&#13;
(b)   improved monitoring and supervision at district level;&#13;
(c)   the appointment of specialized procurement staff, and&#13;
(d)   an efficient cost recovery system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX S&#13;
Page 8 of 11&#13;
38.   There are a number of outstanding issues which require urgent attention, in particular, the&#13;
erratic supply of essential drugs, the shortage of foreign exchange, the role of the private sector in&#13;
distribution, and solutions to the poorly functioning cost recovery system. These issues should be&#13;
addressed through the development of an essential drugs policy.&#13;
Support Program 2: National Food, Environmental and Clinical Laboratory Service&#13;
39.   The country has no national laboratory service despite a perceived requirement to maintain&#13;
quality standards for drugs, food supply, water and the environment. Currently, analyses are&#13;
performed by separate organizations, such as the central medical stores and the district hospitals.&#13;
The objective of this support program is to set up a national laboratory to monitor and test&#13;
standards in drugs prescribed, water quality, the environment and food. The program wilH provide&#13;
a public health laboratory service as well as services to secondary and tertiary clinical care.&#13;
40.   The NHAP sets out a comprehensive set of services as follow:&#13;
(a)   advice to clinicians and policy makers;&#13;
(b)   routine analysis of laboratory samples;&#13;
(c)   training of laboratory staff;&#13;
(d)   quality control of public and non-Government laboratories;&#13;
(e)   provision of safe blood;&#13;
(f)   provision of forensic analysis; and&#13;
(g)   preparation and enforcement of laws.&#13;
41.   The core program includes two of these services: laboratory staff training and the&#13;
provision of safe blood. The cost of the core program is estimated at US$1.5 million (before&#13;
contingencies), all of which is incremental expenditure to be financed.&#13;
42.   Outstanding issues to be resolved include the training and acquisition of specialist staff and&#13;
the potential for laboratory services to generate revenue.&#13;
Support Program 3: Maintenance and Repair&#13;
43.   Maintenance and repair is the most neglected area of all the technical and support&#13;
programs. Physical infrastructure is dilapidated and equipment non-functional. Yet no current&#13;
expenditure is budgeted for maintenance and repair. Accordingly, the NHAP plans to establish&#13;
an ongoing maintenance program to carry out the enormous rehabilitation work required. Both&#13;
district hospitals and peripheral health units will be renovated and re-equipped.&#13;
44.   The services envisaged are mainly concemed with strengthening the organization,&#13;
management and staffing of the maintenance and repair function. Specifically, the NHAP involves&#13;
the establishment of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX $&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
(a)   a central Facilities Management and Maintenance Unit providing services in&#13;
medical electronics, civil works and transport maintenance;&#13;
(b)   regional maintenance and repair departments based at the larger hospitals; and&#13;
(c)   district maintenance units at the district hospitals.&#13;
45.   The core program covers the establishment of organizational units and facilities at the&#13;
central and district level. The estimated cost of the core program is US$13.0 million (before&#13;
contingencies), all of which are incremental costs.&#13;
46.   The successful implementation of the maintenance and repair program under the NHAP&#13;
will require the reorganization and expansion of the maintenance and repair function, supported&#13;
by the installation of management information and control systems. At the district level, a District&#13;
maintenance Officer would be responsible for planning and budgeting, and monitoring contract&#13;
work.&#13;
47.   Outstanding issues to be resolved include the need to develop sound maintenance policies&#13;
and procedures and to complete the construction of maintenance facilities quickly to enable the&#13;
massive rehabilitation program to proceed. In addition, a skilled staffing plan needs to be&#13;
prepared as this program will place major demands on staff capability.&#13;
Support Program 4: Human Resource Management&#13;
48.   The human resource management function is headed by a Personnel Manager who is the&#13;
sole personnel professional employed in the DOH. The scope of this function is presently limited&#13;
to recruitment and promotion services, leave and retirement administration, staff transfers and&#13;
salary administration. Pre-service training is managed separately under the various training&#13;
institutions.&#13;
49.   The most urgent issues facing this support service are:&#13;
(a)   very low remuneration in relation to both a "living" wage and compensation in the&#13;
private and parastatal sectors. This has contributed significantly to the low morale&#13;
in the health service;&#13;
(b)   deficiencies in the manual personnel records system, so that there is no accurate&#13;
information for manpower planning purposes; and&#13;
(c)   weaknesses in pre-service training. There are only 11 full-time trainers in the&#13;
entire DOH.&#13;
50.   The NHAP intends to establish a comprehensive Human Resource Management function&#13;
responsible for all activities related to the resourcing and development of personnel, and employee&#13;
relations. Key actions to be carried out are the:&#13;
(a)   preparation of a long-term manpower plan;&#13;
(b)   development of managerial and technical training plans;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX S&#13;
Page 10 of 11&#13;
(c)   establishment of effective mechanisms for coordinating training and management&#13;
development;&#13;
(d)   development of a HRM capability at head office;&#13;
(e)   establishment of effective employee relations strategies, with an emphasis on pay;&#13;
and&#13;
(f)   establishment of a computerized personnel information system.&#13;
51.   With the exception of a computerized personnel information system, all of these activities&#13;
are included in the core program. In addition, the development of leadership and supervisory&#13;
skills has been explicitly added. The cost of the core program is estimated at US$1.7 million&#13;
(before contingencies), of which US$0.3 million are incremental costs to be financed (At this&#13;
stage, the costs of the overall training program for the DOH have yet to be determined, although&#13;
some provisional estimates for training, of US$4 million, have been incorporated under the&#13;
different technical and support programs).&#13;
52.   The key elements of the HRM component are the development of a manpower and&#13;
training plan, management and clinical training, and strengthening the capability of local training&#13;
institutions.&#13;
53.   Successful implementation of the Human Resource Management program will require&#13;
acceptance of a new approach to managing staff which shifts responsibility from the&#13;
Establishments Department towards the DOH and line managers. Outstanding issues to be&#13;
resolved include:&#13;
(a)   the extent to which the HRM function should be "decentralized" to district level;&#13;
and&#13;
(b)   enhancing staff morale by taking steps to improve the working environment, staff&#13;
remuneration, and attitudes towards employees.&#13;
Support Program 5: Planning, Monitoring, Information and Statistics Unit&#13;
54.   The Planning, Monitoring, Information and Statistics Unit (PMISU) is the basic research&#13;
and data collection center of the health delivery system. The PMISU currently provides services&#13;
in:&#13;
(a)   training district staff in data collection;&#13;
(b)   operating the health management information system;&#13;
(c)   conducting base line surveys; and&#13;
(d)   managing and coordinating development projects.&#13;
55.   Of these services, the management information function is currently in most need of&#13;
improvement because of deficiencies in data collection, analysis and use both at head office and&#13;
district levels. This support program will involve the following services:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 11 of 11&#13;
(a)   training health staff in health and management information;&#13;
(b)   the establishment of district monitoring and evaluation offices;&#13;
(c)   setting up hospital medical records systems;&#13;
(d)   the design and conduct of research studies;&#13;
(e)   the collection and distribution of health information; and&#13;
(f)   support for developing district work plans.&#13;
56.   Of these services, the core program includes the establishment of a district monitoring and&#13;
evaluation capacity, operational research, and support for district work plans. It also includes the&#13;
collection of epidemiological data and support for community management. The estimated cost&#13;
of the core program US$4.8 million (before contingencies), of which US$1.5 million represent&#13;
incremental costs to be financed.&#13;
57.   Key elements of this support program are better trained and equipped staff, strengthened&#13;
district health planning and improved management information systems. In respect of the latter,&#13;
the NHAP seeks to improve the gathering and dissemination of health care information at all&#13;
levels, improve understanding and help professional program managers make better quality&#13;
decisions.&#13;
58.   Successful implementation of this support program will depend crucially on the ability of&#13;
PMISU to train health staff and managers. Outstanding issues are how to ensure that the&#13;
information is both useful for and used by management, and that all divisions cooperate in regular&#13;
data collection.&#13;
Support Program 6: Central Administration&#13;
59.   This support service comprises the central administrative support services, including:&#13;
(a)   financial management, including accounting&#13;
(b)   procurement management&#13;
(c)   transport administration&#13;
60.   The key element of the plan are to develop and implement these systems in the most&#13;
efficient manner. Purchasing and stores management functions will be kept separate from&#13;
financial management and pay functions in the Department to increase transparency and hasten&#13;
implementation. The estimated cost is US$7 million before contingencies.&#13;

Key performance indicators have been developed to monitor programs' progress in inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes and project impact. These indicators will be used&#13;
yearly at the evaluation sections with donors and NGOs to assess the achievement of program objectives, and when and if necessary, will be updated to keep abreast of any&#13;
changes in the sector.&#13;

INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
1.     Due to the sector reform nature of the Project, supervision missions will be done jointly with the&#13;
Department of Health and Social Services and other donor agencies based on progress reports with a common&#13;
format. Currently the Department is planning to invite donors for two reviews per year. One in the first half of the&#13;
year to review progress during the previous year and present a revised strategic plan, and one late in the year to&#13;
present the budget and work program for the following year. It is the Department's intention to collapse these two&#13;
workshops into one later in the program. This schedule, however is based on the current thinking, and thus reflects&#13;
two annual workshops.&#13;
2.     Other implementation support will be provided by Bank staff and consultants on mission to Sierra Leone as&#13;
necessary.&#13;
