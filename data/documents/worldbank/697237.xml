EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. Country Overview&#13;
1.1    Economic Setting. Haiti is a small, densely populated, predominately rural,&#13;
and open economy. Its seven million people occupy 28,000 square kilometers, on the&#13;
western end of the island of Hispaniola. With an estimated GDP per capita of below&#13;
US$250 in 1994, Haiti is the poorest and most densely populated nation in the Western&#13;
Hemisphere. Social indicators are alarming. In 1994, an estimated 50% of the&#13;
population had a caloric intake of below 75% of requirements, and over 25% of&#13;
children suffered from malnutrition. The infant mortality rate is estimated to exceed&#13;
100 per 1,000 live births. Some 50% of adult Haitians are illiterate. Net of emigration&#13;
of 0.5%, the population grew at a rate of 1.8% per year in the 1980s. Estimates of&#13;
unemployment are as high as 70%.&#13;
1.2    During 1980-91, Haiti's population suffered a continuing decline in its standard&#13;
of living, with real per capita incomes falling by about 2% per year. Over decades,&#13;
population pressure and poor public policies forced cultivation of increasingly marginal&#13;
lands, and in turn accelerated deforestation and soil erosion. As a result, agricultural&#13;
production, the main source of income of the 70% of the population who live in rural&#13;
areas, has fallen steadily on a per capita basis since the 1970s. Initially, industrial&#13;
expansion compensated for the decline in agriculture. In the second half of the 1970s,&#13;
a major expansion in the export industry together with increasing public investment&#13;
allowed the country to grow at a rate of about 3% per capita. However, political&#13;
instability during most of the 1980s put a stop to industrial expansion, external&#13;
assistance and, consequently, to growth and investment.&#13;
1.3    Political stalemate during the 1991-1994 period coupled with the international&#13;
embargo on Haiti aggravated the economic decline. In 1990, President Aristide was&#13;
democratically elected and took office in February 1991. His Government undertook&#13;
some measures to improve fiscal revenues, liberalize trade and improve infrastructure&#13;
services, and initiated discussions on an IMF stand-by agreement.  However, in&#13;
September 1991, a military-led coup d'etat forced President Aristide from office and&#13;
into exile. During the following three years. increased economic mismanagement and&#13;
international rejection led to an international embargo, resulting in a dramatic decline&#13;
in living standards. On October 16, 1994, President Aristide was able to return to&#13;
Haiti, and on November 7, 1994. a new constitutional Government was appointed.&#13;
During this period, economic performance deteriorated at an accelerated pace.&#13;
Preliminary data indicate that real GDP fell by over 17% during 1992-93, and by a&#13;
further 10% in 1994. The situation worsened further when tropical storm Gordon hit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Haiti on November 12, 1994.  Agricultural production and exports decreased&#13;
considerably. Export oriented industries were devastated by the embargo. Value-added&#13;
in the services sector decreased in line with GDP, and construction activities came to&#13;
a virtual standstill.&#13;
1.4    Upon its reestablishment, the Constitutional Government presented a coherent&#13;
economic and social rehabilitation program to face the problems and challenges ahead,&#13;
and the international donor community confirmed support for the Government's reform&#13;
efforts. Apart from the preparation of the rehabilitation program, these include the&#13;
creation of an election council and legislation to prepare parliamentary elections, an&#13;
agreement with the IMF on a stand-by arrangement, and the initiation of economic&#13;
policy reforms. At the January 1995 Consultative Group (CG) Meeting held in Paris,&#13;
and again at the CG Follow-up Meeting in Port-au-Prince in May 1995, donors&#13;
pledged and confirmed over US$1.5 billion in support of the Government's efforts.&#13;
US$330 million of this assistance has been disbursed. There was a broad consensus&#13;
regarding the difficult challenges facing Haiti, and the donor community has supported&#13;
the objectives and priorities established by the Government. Donors also agreed on the&#13;
financial and technical requirements for the rehabilitation effort. At the CG Follow-up&#13;
Meeting, IDA provided a brief outline of its assessment of Haiti's economic and social&#13;
conditions, and its strategy to support the Government in key sectors.  IDA also&#13;
reconfirmed its commitment to poverty alleviation by announcing its support for an&#13;
immediate Employment Generation Project, which would build on a successful USAID-&#13;
financed JOBS Creation Project, soon to be completed.&#13;
1.5    Development Strategy. Government's stated development objectives are (a)&#13;
sustained growth and employment creation; (b) poverty alleviation and broad access to&#13;
social services; and (c) environmental rehabilitation. The Government wants to achieve&#13;
these objectives in a framework of national reconciliation and respect for democratic&#13;
rule. It also has committed itself to a comprehensive privatization program and policy&#13;
reforms to support private sector development. The Government further intends to&#13;
strengthen the ability of the state to deliver basic services through public service reform&#13;
and decentralization. It also aims to cooperate with non-governmental organizations&#13;
(NGOs) in the provision of services. Finally, the Government has expressed great&#13;
concern over the country's poor environmental conditions.&#13;
1.6    To address the current economic crisis and move toward its development&#13;
objectives, the Government has (a) been implementing an emergency assistance program&#13;
to provide for basic needs through import finance, civil works and technical assistance;&#13;
and (b) agreed with the IMF on a stand-by arrangement. The assistance program was&#13;
prepared in close collaboration with a multi-agency task force, including IDA. It&#13;
covers the areas of governance, economic assistance and humanitarian aid and is&#13;
estimated to cost US$586 million. As a first step to facilitate implementation and&#13;
strengthen the country's weak absorptive capacity, the Government established, by&#13;
Executive Decree issued December 20, 1994, in the context of IDA's Emergency&#13;
Economic Recovery Credit (EERC; Cr. 2670-HA), an emergency Central&#13;
Implementation Unit (CIU; in French, the Unite Centrale de Gestion - UCG) in the&#13;
Prime Minister's Office (PMO).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.7    Provided the Government succeeds in implementing its reform agenda and the&#13;
pledged assistance is absorbed in a timely manner, the economic outlook for Haiti&#13;
would be favorable, and growth rates of over 5 percent per year could be expected&#13;
during 1995-99. In the short-term, growth policies would aim at initiating economic&#13;
recovery through donor financed rehabilitation activities and reactivation of the&#13;
agricultural sector.  In the medium-term, the country could enjoy a comparative&#13;
advantage in labor-intensive assembly and service industries, some areas of agriculture&#13;
and tourism. However, in the short term, and given the reduced investment and the&#13;
structural problems of the rural sector, the reform agenda would not provide the jobs&#13;
necessary to compensate for the employment losses caused by the manufacturing exodus&#13;
during the embargo, the dissolution of the Armed Forces and the general loss of&#13;
revenue opportunities during the economic depression. The embargo and economic&#13;
decline have been especially hard on the rural and urban poor and the disadvantaged&#13;
groups have few prospects for improvement in the short term. Moreover, extreme&#13;
poverty puts at risk emerging democratic institutions.&#13;
1.8    Poverty Alleviation Strategy. As noted above, Haiti is the poorest country in&#13;
the Western Hemisphere. Because of pervasive poverty and the need for political&#13;
reconciliation, Haiti's development strategy focuses on poverty alleviation in a context&#13;
of social harmony. It is estimated that 60-65% of households in Port-au-Prince, and&#13;
65-70% of households in rural areas fall below the poverty line; since 1991, this level&#13;
has been aggravated by the embargo and by poor economic and social policies.&#13;
1.9    To address these problems the Government has emphasized a commitment to&#13;
comprehensive poverty alleviation activities, focusing, in particular, on rural areas&#13;
where most of the poor are located. This would entail providing income earning&#13;
opportunities to the poor in the context of sustained growth and better targeting and&#13;
delivering social programs to the poor. To achieve this, it would be critical that donor&#13;
financed projects, including IDA, generate income for the poor during the transition&#13;
period to political and economic stability, when private led employment and economic&#13;
growth would pick up the slack in the economy.&#13;
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.10   The Bank Group's assistance to Haiti involves a two-pronged approach. In the&#13;
short-term, IDA has provided emergency financing EERC, and has worked quickly to&#13;
reactivate earlier projects in the country. Particular attention is being paid to aid&#13;
coordination, to assist the Government in mobilizing additional financing for the&#13;
broader Emergency Economic Recovery Program (EERP) and in ensuring that donor&#13;
efforts are complementary rather than duplicative. At the same time, with a view to&#13;
the medium-term, IDA is working with the Government on the formulation of&#13;
strategies for structural reforms essential to reviving growth, poverty alleviation and&#13;
environmental rehabilitation. In view of the continued urgent need for emergency&#13;
relief, IDA is proposing to bridge the transition from short- to medium-term assistance&#13;
with the proposed Employment Generation Project (Chapter 2). Strategically, the&#13;
project would not only serve to boost economic recovery and alleviate poverty, but&#13;
would also provide upstream assistance to facilitate the implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
Government's economic policy reform program, to be supported in FY96 by a Second&#13;
Structural Adjuistment Credit (SAC 11) and a complementary Second Technical&#13;
Assistance Credit (TA C 11).&#13;
1.11   Reviving Growth. Haiti's development agenda is formidable. The country&#13;
is characterized by debilitated institutions, large macroeconomic imbalances, depleted&#13;
productive assets, a dilapidated infrastructure, alarming social indicators, pervasive&#13;
poverty and a degraded environment. Reviving growth will be key, because only in the&#13;
context of a successful growth strategy will the Government be able to address the&#13;
nexus of poverty and environmental degradation which afflicts, in particular, the rural&#13;
population. Some of the ingredients of a growth strategy would entail: (a) facilitating&#13;
private sector development; (b) strengthening institutional capacity; and (c)&#13;
rehabilitating basic infrastructure. The prerequisite for private sector-led development&#13;
in Haiti will be to nurture private sector confidence -- which in turn will depend on&#13;
good governance and economic policy reforms developed through intensive dialogue&#13;
between the Government, private sector and trade unions. IDA is already engaged in&#13;
an intensive policy dialogue with the Government.  Jointly with the International&#13;
Monetary Fund, IDA would assist the Government in elaborating this agenda in the&#13;
context of a 1995-97 Policy Framework Paper. IDA would then propose the SAC II,&#13;
supported by TAC 11, both in FY96.&#13;
1.12   Strengthening the institutional capacity to absorb foreign assistance and&#13;
improve delivery of public services will be vital for Haiti's growth prospects.&#13;
Currently, the public sector is over-extended, poorly organized, and suffers from a&#13;
dearth of technical and management expertise. For IDA, the above-mentioned TAC II&#13;
would focus on the key agencies involved in economic policy management, resource&#13;
mobilization and expenditure control. IDA's ongoing and proposed investment projects&#13;
would also further institutional reforms in the Ministries of Agriculture and Natural&#13;
Resources, Education, Environment, Health, and Public Works and in the water and&#13;
electricity sector. Haiti will also have to spend substantial resources on infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation to support growth. To a significant extent, the only viable solution to&#13;
Haiti's infrastructure problems will be private investment and management. Still, the&#13;
investments to be undertaken by the public sector will require substantial and sustained&#13;
donor assistance and domestic resource mobilization. With IDA's focus shifting more&#13;
heavily to the social sectors and environmental issues, IDB is expected to take the lead&#13;
in infrastructure rehabilitation. Nonetheless, IDA would continue to be engaged in&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation for some time through its ongoing projects in transport,&#13;
electricity and water supply.&#13;
1.13   Alleviating Poverty and Investing in Health and Education.   Haiti's&#13;
development strategy would also attend directly to alleviating poverty and investing in&#13;
the population's health and education. The strategy to address poverty issues would,&#13;
first, converge with the growth strategy in the principal objective of providing income&#13;
earning opportunities to the poor in the context of sustained growth. Second, the&#13;
poverty strategy would also aim to improve access to water, primary health care and&#13;
basic education, thereby mitigating the impact of poverty as well as building the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
country's human resource base to support growth. Third. the poverty strategy would&#13;
attempt to strengthen social safety nets by channeling assistance to vulnerable groups&#13;
and providing resources to communities and non-governmental organizations. The&#13;
proposed Employment Generation Project is one means to implenment such a poverty&#13;
strategy. Further, IDA would continue to place great emphasis on the Economic and&#13;
Social Fund (ESF; Fond d'Action Economique et Sociale - FAES) as a more permanent&#13;
instrument to alleviate poverty, and would support rehabilitation and institutional reform&#13;
in water supply, health and education through the ongoing Port-au-Prince WVater Supply&#13;
(Cr. 2052-HA) and Health1 and Population (Cr. 2085-HA) Projects, and a proposed&#13;
Education Project. To assist the Government in the elaboration of a comprehensive&#13;
medium-term poverty strategy and to provide a framework for the fiture efforts of&#13;
various donors in this area, IDA agreed to take the lead in preparing a two-stage&#13;
Poverry Assessment, with a first output ready in mid-FY96 and a fuller report in FY97.&#13;
1.14   Rehabilitating the Environment.  Sustainable development in Haiti will&#13;
require arresting severe environmental degradation and rehabilitating essential eco-&#13;
systems.  Haiti's main environmental problems pertain to deforestation and soil&#13;
conservation, and are a result of the interaction of demographic pressures, poverty and&#13;
policy failures. Estimates suggest that forest cover has been destroyed in almost all&#13;
of the territory, endangering water supply and causing severe soil erosion. Agricultural&#13;
performance is also constrained by inappropriate land use practices, induced by political&#13;
instability, unclear land tenure, poverty, and lack of public services. These complex&#13;
environmental issues would need to be addressed in the context of a national&#13;
environmental strategy which clearly acknowledges the nexus of environment and&#13;
poverty. Such a strategy would call for the formulation of a National Environmental&#13;
Action Plan (NEAP), for which the Government is seeking assistance. USAID has&#13;
pledged financial support to the NEAP. The UNDP has also indicated support and IDA&#13;
is prepared to assist in the preparation of a NEAP. On the investment side, IDA's&#13;
environmental support would focus on deforestation and soil conservation and their&#13;
links with poverty, including land issues, through a proposed Forestry and Environment&#13;
Project (FY96) and a Rural Poverty Project (FY98/99).&#13;
1.15   The Ongoing Portfolio.  IDA's ongoing portfolio includes about US$150&#13;
million of undisbursed funds from seven projects: the Road Maintenance and&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2691-HA; FY95), pending effectiveness; the Economic and&#13;
Social Fund Project (Cr. 2205-HA; FY91), designed to address basic economic and&#13;
social development needs through grassroots organizations; the Health and Population&#13;
Project (Cr. 2085-HA; FY90), designed to improve essential health services, including&#13;
epidemic control measures; the Industrial Restructuring and Development Project (Cr.&#13;
2071-HA; FY90), designed to provide technical and financial assistance to private,&#13;
mostly small- and medium-sized industrial enterprises; the Fifth Power Project (Cr.&#13;
2053-HA; FY89), designed to rehabilitate generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
services; the Port-au-Prince Water Supply Project (Cr. 2052-HA; FY89), designed to&#13;
increase water production and delivery capacity; and the Seventh Transport Project (Cr.&#13;
1756-HA; FY87), designed to address selected bottlenecks in road and water transport.&#13;
The Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC; Cr. 2670-HA; FY95). the first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
intervention to address Haiti's emergency needs, has already been completely&#13;
disbursed.&#13;
1.16   Possible New Lending. IDA's future lending program would likely include&#13;
the SAC II and TAC 11 in FY96, and investment operations for Environment and&#13;
Forestry (FY96), Education (FY97) and Rural Poverty (FY98/99). Also, if the&#13;
Economic and Social Fund performs well and needs additional support, IDA would&#13;
consider that a priority activity; at the same time IDA's lending program would be&#13;
contingent on significant progress in the reform process and a satisfactory performance&#13;
in implementation of the ongoing portfolio.&#13;
Government Agencies and Other Organizations Related to Employment Programs&#13;
1.17   Prime Minister's Office (PMO).  The PMO  was created in the 1987&#13;
Constitution to lead and coordinate the work of other ministries. Since the return of&#13;
Constitutional rule, the PMO has taken a leading role in coordinating major donor&#13;
emergency programs. To underscore the importance of emergency actions, the Central&#13;
Implementation Unit was created in the PMO in December 1994.&#13;
1.18   The Central Implementation Unit (CIU) reports to a Steering Committee&#13;
(Comit6 Directeur) chaired by the Prime Minister and consisting of the Governor of the&#13;
Central Bank, and the Ministers of Finance and Planning as permanent members, and&#13;
other Ministers depending on the agenda. The CIU's main role is to ensure and&#13;
supervise implementation of the Emergency Program (PURE) by supervising execution,&#13;
carrying out procurement, channelling financing and ensuring the application of&#13;
appropriate guidelines.&#13;
1.19   The Ministry of Public Works is in charge of road infrastructure. It has&#13;
recently created, with IDA and IDB support, a Labor Intensive Unit (Haut Intensite de&#13;
Main d'Oeuvre -- HIMO) to implement labor-intensive road maintenance programs, but&#13;
which is not yet operational. The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources is&#13;
in charge of a wide range of activities in rural areas including management and&#13;
maintenance of primary irrigation canals and soil conservation, which are relevant to&#13;
this project. The Ministry of the Environment was recently created and is not yet&#13;
fully operational. It will focus on normative and regulatory aspects of environmental&#13;
policy and one of its first activities will be to coordinate the National Environmental&#13;
Action Plan. It will also coordinate the environmental assessment activities for large&#13;
projects.&#13;
1.20   The Economic and Social Fund (ESF; in French, Fond d'Action Economique&#13;
et Sociale - FAES) was created by an Executive Decree dated May 20, 1990 as an&#13;
instrument to finance small scale works. It is currently funded by US$23 million from&#13;
IDA and IDB, which together fund social sector projects up to US$50,000 (IDA) and&#13;
small infrastructure up to $75,000 (IDB). Because of the military coup, it only became&#13;
operational in April 1995 and has since May 1995 approved 59 subprojects, mostly&#13;
schools. Because of FAES' short-lived experience and to avoid diverting it away from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
its main focus - small scale works - during its initial start-up phase, the GOH has&#13;
requested that FAES not be directly involved in the implementation of the proposed&#13;
Employment Generation Project other than as a mechanism to ensure a smooth&#13;
transition between USAID and IDA financing. In this context, FAES would finance&#13;
the US$4.6 million shortfall to complete ongoing works for three months starting June&#13;
1, 1995 from the IDB loan.&#13;
1.21   Non-Government Organizations. Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)&#13;
have long been active in Haiti in providing a range of services when state institutions&#13;
have been weak. NGOs range from international organizations (PADF, CECI, CARE,&#13;
etc.), to religious groups (ASMR, BHM, DCCH, MCC, MCEH, ODEE, SEPIC, etc.),&#13;
environmentally oriented groups (ALERTE, ASSODLO, CEHPAPE, GRAPES, etc.),&#13;
social services oriented groups (FEGA, GASC, MODECOD, CCCPV, CCDVA,&#13;
CSMG, etc.), and producer groups and other economic organizations (CODEVA,&#13;
SOPABO, etc.). In all there are more than 200 registered NGOs operating in Haiti.&#13;
Some of these NGOs operate at the grassroots level while a few of the international&#13;
NGOs have established themselves as intermediaries between international donors and&#13;
the grassroots organizations, delivering to the former supervision, accounting and&#13;
evaluation services and to the latter funding, technical assistance, and procurement&#13;
services.&#13;
1.22   The Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) is the international NGO&#13;
that is most relevant to the proposed project because of its role in the ongoing JOBS&#13;
Creation Project financed by USAID. PADF has over 15 years of experience in Haiti,&#13;
a large network of relationships with local NGOs, experience in the management of&#13;
quick response disaster relief programs, and tool procurement expertise. PADF has&#13;
been designated by the Organization of American States to coordinate disaster relief and&#13;
in Haiti PADF has the status of an International Organization and can import goods&#13;
duty free, as well as the status of a Haitian NGO.&#13;
1.23   Current JOBS Creation Project. USAID approved financing of the JOBS&#13;
Creation Project in 1993 as a humanitarian initiative to mitigate the impacts of the&#13;
embargo that followed the military coup of 1991 and to improve Haiti's deteriorating&#13;
productive infrastructure in preparation for the return of democracy. Evaluations of the&#13;
project have shown it to be a success. Initially funded with US$13.7 million to create&#13;
200,000 persons month of work over 14 months, during its final phase the project&#13;
resources amounted to US$27.6 million, partly in US dollars and partly in local&#13;
currency through the PL-480 Title III program  and intended to create 480,000&#13;
person/months of temporary work over a 29 month period, which will end in August&#13;
1995. By March 1, 1995, the projected had created 261,895 persons/month of work,&#13;
equivalent to about 175,000 people, who each worked about one and a half months&#13;
earning US$55. By May 1995, the project had reached 95 % of its job creation targets&#13;
and the project benefits had reached about 846,700 family members of the workers.&#13;
While its primary objective was job creation, the project had the secondary objective&#13;
of improving the country's deteriorating infrastructure, increasing land productivity and&#13;
improving environmental standards in urban centers. Accordingly the project focused&#13;
on four activities: road rehabilitation, irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, soil and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
water conservation, and garbage collection and cleaning of urban drainage canals. As&#13;
of January 1995 the project had cleaned 249 km of urban streets, removed 131,500 m3&#13;
of garbage, rehabilitated 1,600 km of irrigation canals, rehabilitated 934 km of rural&#13;
roads, built 627 km of soil conservation contour terraces and protected 6,400 hectares&#13;
of land. Project implementation was based on a contract between USAID and PADF,&#13;
which then recruited local and grassroots NGOs, which recruited labor and implemented&#13;
the activities. PADF provided funding, technical assistance and tools to these NGOs,&#13;
and inspected, supervised and evaluated them, and reported project progress to USAID.&#13;
USAID-mandated quarterly audits of PADF accounts were satisfactory.&#13;
1.24   Lessons Learned from  Employment Generation Programs in Other&#13;
Countries. Employment generation programs in other countries, including Peru, Chile,&#13;
Bolivia and India, have been most successful when the following factors have been&#13;
present:&#13;
(a)    Wages provided are lower than the minimum wage, thereby ensuring&#13;
that the benefits of the program would not be appropriated by the non-&#13;
poor.&#13;
(b)    The program is targeted geographically, to ensure that it is accessible&#13;
to the poor.&#13;
(c)    The implementing agency is staffed by technically qualified staff and&#13;
allowed to function according to clear, and transparently applied&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
(d)    Monitoring systems are established to provide timely feedback.&#13;
(e)    Works selected have high labor content and result in investments that&#13;
are of value to the poor.&#13;
1.25   The experience in West Africa with the Senegal AGETIP (Executing Agency&#13;
for Public Interest Works -- Agence d'Ex6cution de Travaux d'lnteret Publique) model&#13;
is relevant to the proposed project. The World Bank-supported AGETIP model was&#13;
created in 1989 in a context of rapid urbanization, economic crisis, ending of the&#13;
welfare state, beginning of a decentralization strategy, dwindling resources at the central&#13;
level and a lack of resource mobilization capacity at the local level. The AGETIP was&#13;
established as an NGO for delegated contract management of municipal small-scale&#13;
works, construction and rehabilitation executed by small private firms. The objectives&#13;
of the AGETIP were to, without increasing the size of the public sector, efficiently&#13;
implement low cost, high priority public works, while establishing transparent&#13;
procurement practices, and strengthening local contractors by providing technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
1.26   The model has succeeded in providing employment and subsistence to unskilled&#13;
workers while achieving durable economic benefits through the implementation of a&#13;
well-selected works and services program and the strengthening participating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9-&#13;
municipalities, contractors and engineering consulting firms. Today there are a number&#13;
of AGETIP-type organizations in West Africa. Keys to the success of the AGETIP&#13;
model were:&#13;
(a)    Clear focus and Government support.&#13;
(b)    Private independent status of the agency and a competent director.&#13;
(c)    Transparent and flexible subproject selection.&#13;
(d)    Rapid procedures allowing payments in less than two weeks --restoring&#13;
public credibility and reducing costs.&#13;
(e)    Transparent procedures, including frequent audits and ex-post controls.&#13;
1.27   The advantages of the AGETIP model listed above are shared by the NGO&#13;
which is implementing the major component of the USAID Jobs Creation project,&#13;
PADF, and have been major factors in its success in reaching employment creation&#13;
targets rapidly while maintaining the quality and transparency of the implementation&#13;
process. However, the creation and use of a specialized, semi-autonomous NGO&#13;
dedicated to contract management has been criticized for: (a) not contributing to&#13;
institutional strengthening of line ministries or local governments ultimately responsible&#13;
for these works; (b) inadequate links with sectoral strategies; and (c) creation of a&#13;
monopoly situation, in which competition from other contract management agencies is&#13;
lacking. The Government of Haiti wishes to address these longer term issues through&#13;
the studies and technical assistance included in the institutional development component,&#13;
and gives high priority to developing in- country capacity to carry out the functions&#13;
until now executed solely by the international NGO.&#13;
1.28   With respect to rural road rehabilitation and maintenance in particular, labor&#13;
intensive technologies for rural roads have been employed in a range of countries and&#13;
have been found to be economically justified. Traditional rural road rehabilitation has&#13;
emphasized the use of grading equipment and graveling of entire lengths, often&#13;
neglecting needed drainage works as well as compacting. Newer approaches have&#13;
successfully emphasized greater attention to drainage works, resulting in a labor content&#13;
of from 40% to 60% of the total cost of the work. Once a rural road has been&#13;
rehabilitated, routine maintenance can be provided by an individual who, with simple&#13;
tools would care for a specific stretch of the road (e.g., 2 km). This approach has been&#13;
used successfully in many countries, including Brazil and Colombia. New road&#13;
construction works are not generally suitable for labor intensive approaches, and are not&#13;
considered in the present project.&#13;
1.29   Lessons Learned from  Haiti Employment Programs.  In May 1995&#13;
consultants carried out an evaluation of the JOBS Creation Project for USAID&#13;
(para.4. 1(a)). The key lessons learned from the project were:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(a)    The project's institutional structures contribUted to its success. Four&#13;
layers of institutions were involved: (i) the internationial donior: (ii) a&#13;
Project Management Agency (PADF) with a good network of liks to&#13;
grassroots organizations: (iii) the grassroots organizations themilselves:&#13;
and (iv) social groups and associationis that supplied workers for the&#13;
projects. In particular, the role of the Pr-oject Management Agency was&#13;
critical: (i) it provided transparency. accountabil i ity and( political&#13;
neutrality  in the selection of both subprojects and implemilenitin g&#13;
organizations; and (ii) it maintained satisfactory finanicial, technical and&#13;
management standards.&#13;
(b)    The majority of project resources went directly to the work force. Of&#13;
total project costs, between 60 and 65% were (lirect labor payments.&#13;
and another 15% covered the incremental costs of local NGOs. Thus&#13;
more than 75%  of the project costs wenit directly into the subproject&#13;
areas. The remaining funds coveredl the costs of tools, otlher equipment&#13;
and materials, and PADF engineering, management and administration.&#13;
(c)    The project improved governance at the local level. T'he project led to&#13;
more intensive activities by local groups, encouraging skills in group&#13;
interaction, organization and management.&#13;
(d)    Cash payments were more effective and eefficient than providing food&#13;
for work. Workers were overwhelmingly pleased with cash payments&#13;
rather than payments in food or bv other means. whichi have&#13;
traditionally been used in Haiti. The evaluation showed that workers&#13;
used cash payments to pay for schooling, seeds, tools arid medical care,&#13;
in addition to the purchasing of food. The use of cash payments also&#13;
greatly reduced the project management requirermients that are&#13;
associated with food for work programs.  While many humanitarian&#13;
relief programs use food distribution, local NGOs adamantly preferred&#13;
using cash rather than food for paying workers as the distribution of&#13;
food creates a need for storage, transportation, security and special&#13;
accounting.&#13;
(e)    Subproject prototypes and standards were very usefuil to proiect&#13;
implementation. Prototypes and standards allowed the Implementing&#13;
Organizations with less experience to produce higher quality work and&#13;
facilitated estimating labor needs and supervising activities.&#13;
(f)    The proiect had flexibility to adiust to unforeseen events.  Design&#13;
flexibility allowed the project to adjust to marked changes in the&#13;
political and economic climate, which ranged from the international&#13;
embargo under the military regimen to the restoration of democracy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. The Project&#13;
2.1    Origin. The proposed project was prepared as a result of the Consultative&#13;
Group Follow-up Meeting held May 11-12, 1995 in Port-au-Prince and on the basis of&#13;
initial work done on employment generation as part of the preparation of the Second&#13;
Structural Adjustment and Technical Assistance Credits. During these meetings the&#13;
Government requested IDA support for the ongoing JOBS Creation Project, financed&#13;
until now by USAID. and implemented in part by an international NGO, the Pan&#13;
American Development Foundation (PADF).  USAID funds will soon be fully&#13;
disbursed and Governmient attaches unusually high priority to the JOBS Creation Project&#13;
as a means to address immediate poverty alleviation objectives, particularly during a&#13;
politically volatile period and while democratic institutions are still fragile.&#13;
2.2    To support the preparation of subprojects and related procurement of tools and&#13;
equipment, IDA has approved US$705,000 of financing through the Project Preparation&#13;
Facility (PPF; P-992-HA and P-932-0-HA). In addition, IDB is financing a US$4.6&#13;
million shortfall through FAES to permit the current ongoing employment generation&#13;
program to continue until IDA funds are available for disbursements against labor&#13;
payments in September 1995.  The PPFs will also be used to finance technical&#13;
assistance required to conduct a more in-depth evaluation of the works being&#13;
implemented by PADF in order to identify ways to strengthen technical quality and&#13;
sustainability of works carried out in the project.&#13;
2.3    Objectives. The primary objective of the project is to provide short term&#13;
employment to people in extreme poverty in support of Government's program for&#13;
poverty alleviation. By doing so, the project would continue support for job creation&#13;
efforts undertaken since 1993, and achieve other objectives including the improvement&#13;
of seriously deteriorated economic and productive infrastructure.  In addition, the&#13;
project will strengthen the capacity of national and local government, NGOs and local&#13;
communiity organizations to manage employment-intensive small scale development&#13;
projects in the future.&#13;
2.4    Summary Description. The project would have the following components:&#13;
(a)    Employment Generation. Contracts covering management, supervision,&#13;
labor costs and associated equipment, vehicles and materials for high&#13;
priority small scale development activities, especially in the areas of (i)&#13;
rural road rehabilitation; (ii) soil conservation (watershed management,&#13;
erosion control and soil reclamation); (iii) rehabilitation of irrigation&#13;
and drainage canals; and (iv) urban waste management (solid waste&#13;
disposal and clearing of waste water ditches).&#13;
(b)    Institutional Development: Training, technical assistance and studies,&#13;
office space, vehicles, equipment, furniture and other incremental&#13;
operational support, including staff, to assist (i) the CIU, selected local&#13;
government bodies, NGOs and other project organizations in the&#13;
implementation of small scale labor intensive programs on a technically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
sound and sustainable basis; (ii) the establishment of a national&#13;
autonomous non-government entity offering delegated contract&#13;
management services; and (iii) the development of a longer term&#13;
strategy for poverty alleviation, employment and small infrastructure&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
2.5    Rationale for IDA Involvement. The overall Bank Group Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy for Haiti is discussed in para. 1 .10. The proposed project would immediately&#13;
and directly support the Government's objectives of growth and employment creation,&#13;
poverty alleviation and environmental rehabilitation by financing subprojects for the&#13;
rehabilitation of economic infrastructure (roads, irrigation, drainage), and environmental&#13;
management (soil conservation, waste management). The draft Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy being prepared for Board Presentation in FY96 with the proposed Second&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit supports these objectives.  The Haiti Employment&#13;
Generation Project would provide a transition between the emergency nature of the&#13;
JOBS Creation Project and the longer term development agenda by addressing issues&#13;
of works sustainability and sectoral linkages, especially for maintenance, and issues of&#13;
decentralization and governance, through institutional development and training for local&#13;
implementing organizations.&#13;
2.6    Program Objective Categories. As described above, most project activities&#13;
and benefits are related to employment generation for the target poverty group for work&#13;
programs related to productive agriculture, transport and environmental management.&#13;
Tlherefore the project would be designated as belonging to the Program Objective&#13;
Categories of (a) Poverty Alleviation and (b) Environmentally Sustainable Development.&#13;
The project would be included in the Poverty Category: Program of Targeted&#13;
Interventions.&#13;
2.7    Detailed Description - Employment Generation Component (US$51.4&#13;
million). The objective of this component would be to create temporary jobs for the&#13;
equivalent of about 40,000 people per month and a total of about 490,000 person-&#13;
months, who in turn would support nearly 1.6 million family members (Annex 1, Table&#13;
2). The component would also improve productive infrastructure and the environment.&#13;
The project would finance labor costs and related equipment and management costs of&#13;
subprojects to be executed by local NGOs and communities covering the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
(a)    Rehabilitation of Rural Roads, including culverts, and bridges.&#13;
(b)    Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Canals, including cleaning.&#13;
(c)    Soil Conservation:   Watershed protection, erosion control, soil&#13;
reclamation.&#13;
(d)    Waste Manazement: Urban solid waste disposal and clearing urban&#13;
waste water ditches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.8    Besides these four subcomponents, it may be possible to include other activities&#13;
agreed between the Government and IDA if they have a high labor content and positive&#13;
economic, social and environmental impacts.&#13;
2.9    Within each subcomponent, selection of individual subprojects use the following&#13;
criteria:&#13;
(a)    Geographical coverage:  Wide geographical coverage including the&#13;
poorest sections of the country, both rural and urban.&#13;
(b)    Implementing Organization: Capability and availability of the proposed&#13;
Implementing Organization (10) in the subproject area to manage the&#13;
administrative and technical aspects of the subproject.&#13;
(c)    Poverty and social orientation: The most disadvantaged groups would&#13;
be targeted, and at least 20% of workers would be poor women.&#13;
(d)    Economic and social utility: To select projects which provide the&#13;
greatest economic and social benefits.&#13;
(e)    Technical soundness:  Minimum  technical standards would be a&#13;
condition for eligibility.&#13;
(f)    Labor content: Labor costs be about 60% of the total costs of the&#13;
project, unless otherwise agreed.&#13;
(g)    Sustainability:   Subprojects where local commitment has been&#13;
demonstrated to finance and undertake a maintenance program and to&#13;
contribute to costs of initial investment.&#13;
(h)    Ease and speed of implementation: Preference to projects that can be&#13;
completed in fewer than four months and that are simple in terms of&#13;
logistics.&#13;
(i)    Accountability: Labor inputs would be measurable and verifiable.&#13;
(j)    Environmental screening: Environmentally risky projects would be&#13;
excluded or would be subject to prior approval by IDA.&#13;
2.10   Targeting mechanisms. The Employment Generation Component would target&#13;
the poorest groups, both in rural and urban areas. In addition to the equity reasons for&#13;
doing so, there are efficiency reasons as well, because the poor have the lowest&#13;
opportunity costs for their labor; hence, a project targeted to the poor would be less&#13;
likely to compete with other productive activities. The project would use a combination&#13;
of targeting mechanisms:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
(a)    Most of the work would involve strenuous physical labor, using hand&#13;
tools and requiring workers to walk long distances to the subproject&#13;
site.&#13;
(b)    Workers would be selected by the Implementing Organizations, usually&#13;
NGOs, which would involve a measure of self-selecting those who have&#13;
invested their own time in participating in NGO meetings and other&#13;
activities.&#13;
(c)    Workers would contribute one day of free labor for each five days of&#13;
paid labor. This targeting mechanism would serve another important&#13;
function by freeing up part of the project's financial resources to permit&#13;
the employment of more people.&#13;
(d)    Workers would work a maximum of six weeks to permit other workers&#13;
to participate.&#13;
. 11   Detailed Description - Instittitional Development Component.  (US$5&#13;
million) The objectives of the institutional development component would be to: (a)&#13;
strengthen the technical quality, local government and 10 participation, sustainability,&#13;
and employment generation aspects of the individual subprojects financed; and (b)&#13;
develop local institutional capacity and plans for continuing the financing and&#13;
implementation of labor-intensive small scale public works programs.&#13;
2.12  In order to achieve these objectives, the following activities would be financed&#13;
(see also annex 2):&#13;
(a)    Consultant services to  conduct half-yearly  technical, financial,&#13;
managerial and environmental evaluations and quarterly financial&#13;
audits. The first half-yearly evaluation would cover the period ending&#13;
September 30, 1995 and be due by November 30, 1995, and include&#13;
a rapid appraisal of the experience of the USAID-financed JOBS&#13;
Creation Project to evaluate the experience and identify further ways&#13;
to strengthen the technical quality, sustainability and employment&#13;
generation aspects of the subprojects, as well as to develop and&#13;
improve local government and 10 participation.&#13;
(b)    Technical assistance, training and office equipment and supplies to&#13;
strengthen the capacities of local governments and lOs to identify,&#13;
prepare, implement, manage, and maintain labor intensive economic&#13;
development subprojects. Institutional development activities would&#13;
build on the recommendations of the appraisal above and the MTPTC&#13;
experience in rural roads maintenance. Technical assistance would also&#13;
include governance issues to enhance responsiveness to high priority&#13;
poverty groups through participatory methods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(c)    Consultant services and workshops to develop works maintenance and&#13;
long-term institutional strategies in consultation with communities,&#13;
NGOs and communal governments, as well as the establishment of an&#13;
institution to serve as a delegated contract management agent.&#13;
(d)    Technical assistance, training, vehicles, office equipment and supplies,&#13;
and incremental recurrent costs as well as office space to strengthen the&#13;
capacity of the CIU to supervise and manage the project, including&#13;
management, reporting, monitoring and evaluation. Funds would also&#13;
be made available for studies agreed with IDA related to project&#13;
objectives, translating the Staff Appraisal Report and other project&#13;
documents, for projects evaluations and auditing as well as preparing&#13;
other documentation relevant to the project.&#13;
(e)    A review of the Haitian Public Procurement Act. Although under the&#13;
executive order that established the CIU, the CIU is not subject to the&#13;
provisions of the Act, a review of the Act, with a view to making&#13;
needed modifications, would be useful in the context of possible future&#13;
externally assisted development projects.&#13;
2.13   Costs. The project is estimated to cost US$56.4 million equivalent. Foreign&#13;
costs would represent about 12% of total project costs and the implementing agency is&#13;
exempt from taxes. Average subproject costs are estimated at US$360,000 equivalent.&#13;
Since subprojects are yet to be identified, and would be implemented over a short&#13;
period (about one year), neither price nor physical contingencies have been calculated.&#13;
Any increase in the expected average subproject costs would lead to a reduction in the&#13;
number of projects to be financed. The estimated sectoral distribution in the project&#13;
cost tables reflects past PADF experience in the JOBS Creation Project. Costs were&#13;
converted at the prevailing market rate for foreign exchange (US$1 = G14.7). Project&#13;
cost tables are presented in Annex 3, Tables 1-3.&#13;
2.14   Financing. US$50 million would be financed by the IDA Credit, and the&#13;
remainder by the Government of Haiti, participating NGOs and beneficiaries (see&#13;
financing plan in Annex 3, Table 4.) During the JOBS Creation Project about 5-10%&#13;
of subproject costs have been financed by NGOs themselves.  During project&#13;
implementation mechanisms for increasing direct contributions by the NGOs, local&#13;
communities and beneficiaries, e.g., of labor and material, would be explored, both to&#13;
stretch project financing to create more jobs and as a self-targeting mechanism.&#13;
2.15  IDA would finance a high percentage of local and total costs. Local cost&#13;
financing and the high IDA cost sharing percentage is justified because of the critical&#13;
importance of maintaining the ongoing employment generation program during a time&#13;
of unusually high political and economic uncertainty.&#13;
2.16   To smooth the transition from USAID to IDA financing, IDA has approved&#13;
US$705,000 in PPF financing to purchase tools and hire staff to assist organized groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
to prepare subprojects, and thereby maintain the current level of 40,000 persons now&#13;
employed by the JOBS Creation Project per month (para.4. I(b)).&#13;
2.17   Organization and Management. The Government implementing agency would&#13;
be the Central Implementation Unit (CIU) of the Prime Minister's Office, which would&#13;
have responsibility for overall project planning, monitoring and evaluation   The&#13;
governing board of the CIU is a Cabinet level Steering Committee chaired by the Prime&#13;
Minister, which is responsible for overall planning and establishment of policy; the&#13;
operational head of the CIU is a Director General (see CIU Organization Chart in&#13;
Annex 2). To implement the project, the CIU would engage full time professional staff&#13;
or consultants covering the areas of: Project Coordination, engineering (for rural roads,&#13;
soil conservation and irrigation and drainage), agronomy, environmental assessment and&#13;
accounting (some staff may cover more than one area). If there are additional staff&#13;
requirements, they could be engaged on a temporary basis from consulting firms, rather&#13;
than being hired as CIU contractual staff.&#13;
2.18   During negotiations an assurance was obtained that the CIU would maintain&#13;
adequate staff and/or engage consultants/consulting firms with qualifications and&#13;
experience satisfactory to IDA to carry out the project (para.4.2(a)).&#13;
2.19   For support in program planning, implementation and supervision of subproject&#13;
execution, the CIU would contract with Project Management Agencies (PMAs; in&#13;
French: Maitre d'Ouvrage Del6gue - MDOD). The initial PMA would be PADF (see&#13;
PADF Organization Chart in Annex 2), which has been successfully carrying out the&#13;
USAID-financed JOBS Creation Project, although provisions would be made for&#13;
involving other possible PMAs during the course of the project. One of PADF's&#13;
responsibilities would be to provide technical assistance to identified potential PMAs.&#13;
During negotiations an assurance was obtained that agreements with PMAs would be&#13;
on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and the first such agreement was signed,&#13;
between the CIU and PADF, on June 8, 1995 (para.4.1(c)).&#13;
2.20   Subprojects would be implemented by local NGOs, community organizations,&#13;
local government bodies and private firms known collectively as Implementation&#13;
Organizations (1Os). Subproject proposals would be submitted to a PMA and to the&#13;
CIU. The PMA, under its contract with the CIU, would, in collaboration with the&#13;
CIU, provide technical assistance for subproject preparation, screening, appraising,&#13;
supervising, monitoring and evaluating, procure hand tools and other needed equipment,&#13;
and make the required payments to the lOs. Final decisions regarding subproject&#13;
selection would be the responsibility of the CIU and the CIU would furnish to IDA a&#13;
work program each quarter describing the proposed subprojects for IDA review and&#13;
approval. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained that subprojects would be&#13;
executed on the basis of technical, financial, environmental, managerial and other&#13;
specifications and procedures described in operating manuals acceptable to IDA&#13;
(para.4.2(c)).&#13;
2.21   Procedures used by the JOBS Creation Project would be adopted by the project&#13;
with a few revisions designed to improve technical quality (e.g., road compacting and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
improved use of construction materials), and to increase linkages with local government&#13;
authorities and line ministries, such as the maintenance program of the MTPTC.&#13;
2.22   In particular, local government authorities would become the focus for local&#13;
planning, with technical assistance provided to help stimulate planning for and creation&#13;
of proposals for subproject financing to NGOs or Municipal Governments (Communes)&#13;
themselves.&#13;
2.23   Local Community Participation and NGOs. The JOBS Creation Project, as&#13;
currently financed by USAID, is being implemented by local community associations&#13;
and NGOs and a few communes, and a number of these were consulted during project&#13;
preparation and appraisal.  The present project would continue this practice and&#13;
strengthen their role by:&#13;
(a)    Providing training for subprojects requested by grassroots organizations&#13;
and local governments.&#13;
(b)    Involving these organizations in planning for and conducting routine&#13;
maintenance on completed works.&#13;
(c)    Strengthening the role of the local government and its subdivisions&#13;
(municipalities and CASECs) in the identification, planning and&#13;
maintenance of employment generation works.&#13;
2.24   As discussed above, one of the selection criteria for potential subprojects would&#13;
be the willingness of the proposed IOs to make labor or in-kind contributions to the&#13;
subproject. Typically, this will include an 10 contribution of management and other&#13;
overheads of about 5% of total subproject costs, and a contribution by direct&#13;
beneficiaries of one day of free labor for each five days of paid labor. Among other&#13;
things, this selection criterion will help ensure that the proposed subprojects are a&#13;
priority for the lOs and beneficiaries.&#13;
2.25   Procurement. Under the executive order that established the CIU, the CIU is&#13;
not subject to the provisions of the Haitian Public Procurement Act. Thus, CIU's&#13;
procurement process may follow the rules of the bilateral and multilateral institutions&#13;
that finance the projects it coordinates. As a consequence, no special provisions are&#13;
required in the Development Credit Agreement to ensure that IDA procurement&#13;
guidelines take precedence over certain provisions of the Act that have been found&#13;
inconsistent. In addition, the initial PMA (PADF) has considerable experience in&#13;
procurement of goods and works for subprojects in Haiti as a result of its&#13;
implementation of the USAID-financed JOBS Creation Project and can be relied upon&#13;
to manage the procurement of its part of the project in an economic and efficient&#13;
manner.&#13;
2.26   The proposed procurement arrangements for the project are summarized in the&#13;
following table and an assurance was obtained during negotiations that the CIU and&#13;
the PMA(s) will follow these arrangements during project implementation (para.4.2(d)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.27   Community Participation and Direct Contracting.  In accordance with&#13;
paragraphs 3.7 and 3.15 of the Guidelines for Procurement of Goods and Works&#13;
(January 1995), the appraisal mission reviewed special procedures to facilitate direct&#13;
contracting and the participation of the lOs in the implementation of the project. The&#13;
proposed arrangements, which were reflected in the operational manual agreed during&#13;
negotiations, provide that the PMA select the most appropriate procurement procedure&#13;
according to the subproject in question. To the extent possible, procurement of works&#13;
and goods for subprojects would be carried out using lump-sum contracts (for small&#13;
works) and shopping (for goods). Direct contracting would apply to works and goods&#13;
under subprojects, which are located predominantly in isolated rural areas and where&#13;
competitive proposals cannot be obtained. Such direct contracting would be subject to&#13;
an aggregate contract value of US$30 million for works and US$2 million for goods.&#13;
In each case, the final decision on the appropriate procedure should take into account&#13;
the type and size of the subproject and its geographical coverage. Details about criteria&#13;
for the selection, documentary evidence required for the expenditures and monitoring&#13;
of the procurement process appear in Annex 1. Purchases of hand tools and some&#13;
equipment and vehicles for subprojects would be made centrally by the PMA(s) using&#13;
international shopping procedures, which will not exceed US$500,000 per contract and&#13;
US$5 million in the aggregate.&#13;
2.28   Works. For the Employment Generation component, works would be included&#13;
in the contracts signed between the CIU and PMA(s) and would follow the procurement&#13;
procedures outlined above. There are no civil works expected for the Institutional&#13;
Development component; however, if certain civil works are required during the&#13;
implementation of this component, e.g., refurbishment of CIU offices, they would be&#13;
small in size (certainly under US$150,000 per contract and not to exceed US$2 million&#13;
in the aggregate) and it is unlikely that foreign contractors would be interested.&#13;
Accordingly, procedures for procurement of small works acceptable to IDA would be&#13;
used (lump-sum contracts awarded on the basis of price quotations from three eligible&#13;
contractors, provided that they have the experience and resources to complete the&#13;
contract successfully).&#13;
2.29   Goods. Goods for the Employment Generation component, e.g., hand tools,&#13;
would be included in the PMA contracts, and would be procured following the shopping&#13;
and direct contracting procedures outlined above. For the Institutional Development&#13;
component, contracts for goods exceeding US$150,000 (if any; there are none expected)&#13;
would be awarded through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) following IDA&#13;
procurement guidelines and using IDA-issued Standard Bidding Documents. Contracts&#13;
for goods expected to cost between US$50,000 and US$150,000, not exceeding an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$3 million, would be procured under NCB (if any; there are&#13;
none expected). Office equipment and supplies, furniture and other similar goods&#13;
expected to cost less than US$50,000 per contract would be awarded on the basis of an&#13;
evaluation of price quotations invited from at least three suppliers, provided they do not&#13;
exceed an aggregate of US$3 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
2.30   Consultant services, training and studies. The World Bank's "Guidelines on&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency" (August 1981) will govern consultancies financed under the project.&#13;
2.31   Review by IDA. Although no ICB or NCB is expected, ICB contracts, and the&#13;
first two NCB contracts for goods or works would be subject to prior IDA review of&#13;
bidding documents, bid evaluation, award proposals and final contracts. Prior review&#13;
of all consultant contracts and selection processes would be required for contracts with&#13;
firms exceeding US$50,000 and with individuals exceeding $30,000. IDA prior review&#13;
would also be required for the terms of reference for all consulting services contracts.&#13;
Approximately 80% of consulting services contracts would be subject to prior review.&#13;
While the overall level of prior review is relatively low, it is considered acceptable in&#13;
light of the audit arrangements for the project, and procurement would be specifically&#13;
included in the terms of reference for the financial audits (para.2.39).&#13;

2.32    Disbursements.  The proposed IDA  credit would be disbursed over about 19 months, starting&#13;
in late July/early August 1995. The project completion date would be September 30, 1996 and&#13;
disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1996. The formal Credit Closing Date&#13;
would be March 31, 1997.&#13;
2.33    IDA  would disburse at a rate of 100%  for all project expenditures except those contributed by&#13;
lOs and the beneficiaries themselves. Annex 3, Table 5 shows the allocation of Credit proceeds.&#13;
Expenses for subprojects will only be eligible for IDA disbursement if included in a quarterly work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21 -&#13;
program approved by IDA; the first such quarterly report would be furnished within one month of Credit&#13;
effectiveness (para. 4.3).&#13;
2.34   The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 3, Table 6) is based on the disbursement experience&#13;
of the JOBS Creation Project currently being implemented by PADF, and does not reflect the standard&#13;
disbursement profile for IDA projects in Haiti, which, among other things, may be considered misleading&#13;
because it includes data from the turbulent period during 1991-94 when disbursements were very low.&#13;
2.35   The Borrower would establish a Special Account in US dollars in the Central Bank of Haiti, with&#13;
an authorized allocation of US$1.5 million, equal to about four months' estimated average disbursements,&#13;
net of payments to PMAs, which would be made directly. For this purpose a PMA would establish a&#13;
separate bank account for project funds.&#13;
2.36   Because of the critical nature of effective project start-up, including the early procurement of hand&#13;
tools that will be required immediately when subprojects begin in September 1995, retroactive financing&#13;
would be provided for up to 10% of the IDA Credit for project activities incurred after June 1. 1995.&#13;
Initial payments for tool orders and related contractual services needed to maintain current levels of&#13;
employment during the transition from USAID to IDB financing is being financed by PPFs P-929-HA&#13;
(US$750,000) and P-932-0-HA (US$205,000).&#13;
2.37   All disbursements that do not have a prior review requirement would be made on the basis of&#13;
statements of expenditures (SOEs). including subprojects. Use of SOEs for goods and works would be&#13;
limited to contracts costing less than US$50,000 and US$150,000. respectively. Use of SOEs for&#13;
consultant services would be limited to contracts with consulting firms or individuals costing US$50,000&#13;
or US$30,000 or less, respectively.&#13;
2.38   Information required for the SOEs would be available in the project data base, updated monthly&#13;
by the PMA(s) and submitted to the CIU. Supporting documentation would be made available to IDA&#13;
for review.&#13;
2.39   Accounts and Auditing. The CIU and the PMA(s) would maintain separate accounts for project&#13;
expenditures. An assurance was obtained during negotiations (para.4.2(e)) that: (a) these accounts&#13;
would be audited every quarter by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA; and (b) the audit report of&#13;
project accounts, including a separate opinion on Statements of Expenditure (SOEs), and the financial&#13;
statements themselves, would be provided to IDA within 2 months of the end of each quarter. The first&#13;
report would be due November 30. 1995 for the quarter ending September 30. 1995. Expenditures&#13;
related to the audits would be eligible for financing under the Credit. The audit reports would convey&#13;
the auditor's opinion and comments as necessary on the methodology employed in the compilation of the&#13;
statements of expenditures, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for financing&#13;
in terms of the project's legal agreements, and standards of record keeping and internal controls related&#13;
to the above. The TOR for the auditors would also include a specific analysis of compliance with&#13;
procurement procedures, including physical audits as appropriate.&#13;
2.40 Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation. Responsibilities of the Implementing Organizations (the&#13;
local NGOs and community organizations) with respect to reporting would be specified in the contracts&#13;
between the lOs and the PMA(s). The CIU and the PMA(s) would regularly collect and analyze data on&#13;
key indicators to monitor progress in physical execution and assess project impact, comparing the results&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
with the pre-project estimates. The PMA(s) would prepare and send to the CIU quarterly progress&#13;
reports within 15 days of the end of the quarter. The overall CIU quarterly report, the PMA reports and&#13;
copies of the studies carried out during project implementation would be sent to IDA within 30 days of&#13;
the end of the quarter. The quarterly reports would both describe progress in project execution, and&#13;
identify possible implementation issues and propose appropriate solutions. The format for quarterly&#13;
reports, and project implementation and impact indicators, are in Annex 4.&#13;
2.41   IDA would supervise the project regularly, and an assurance was obtained during negotiations&#13;
that IDA would receive copies of quarterly project progress reports in an agreed format within 30 days&#13;
of the end of the quarter (para. 4.2(f)).&#13;
2.42   In addition to the quarterly reports prepared by the CIU/PMA(s), there would be half-yearly&#13;
independent evaluations of project implementation carried out by an outside firm. The evaluations would&#13;
cover technical, financial, managerial, environmental aspects of the project under TOR acceptable to IDA.&#13;
As with the half-yearly financial audit reports, during negotiations, an assurance was obtained that these&#13;
evaluations would be submitted to IDA within two months of the end of the semester (para. 4.2(g)).&#13;
TOR for the evaluations are in Annex 2 and the first such evaluation would be due November 30, 1995&#13;
for the semester ending September 30, 1995. Expenditures related to these evaluations would be eligible&#13;
for financing under the Credit.&#13;
2.43   Since the first half-yearly evaluation will cover the start-up period of the project up to September&#13;
1995, it would focus on the issue of sustainability of both the employment generation program and of the&#13;
specific investments. Among other things, this assessment would complement the review of the USAID-&#13;
financed JOBS Creation Project carried out in April-May 1995, as well as review the lessons learned in&#13;
other countries (para. 1.24). Terms of reference (TOR) for this first half-yearly evaluation are in Annex&#13;
2 and include the following:&#13;
(a)    Characteristics of the AGETIP-model that would be used in developing the model for the&#13;
Haitian PMA(s) to be established under the project.&#13;
(b)    Strengthening of the rural road unit linked to the Ministry of Public Works, Transport&#13;
and Communications (MTPTC) that would adopt approaches tested and proven by the&#13;
JOBS Creation Project, with future employment generation programs related to roads&#13;
handled by this unit in conjunction with local authorities.&#13;
(c)    Strengthening of soil conservation and irrigation/drainage functions in MOA by similar&#13;
means, with future employment generation programs related to soil conservation handled&#13;
by MOA in conjunction with local authorities and community groups.&#13;
(d)    Measures to return garbage collection responsibilities to local urban authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
III. Project Analysis&#13;
3.1    Economic analysis. A recent independent evaluation of the ongoing PADF program concluded&#13;
that the economic benefits on a net present value basis are high. For individual families, the immediate&#13;
difference in household income and nutritional levels provided by the project's direct employment&#13;
generation income is expected to be substantial. While most of the wage income was used for buying&#13;
food, some income was invested in schooling, medical care, improved seeds, livestock and other assets.&#13;
Other direct economic benefits would include the productive impact of irrigation, drainage and soil&#13;
conservation works.&#13;
3.2    One measure of project economic performance is its cost effectiveness in achieving its job creation&#13;
objective. The cost per job in subprojects under the JOBS Creation Project averaged about US$1.80 per&#13;
person per day, which compares favorably with the performance of job creation projects elsewhere. For&#13;
example, although in an Indonesian rural works program the costs per job were lower at US$1.10 per&#13;
person day, in similar projects in Kenya and the eastern Caribbean the costs per job were US$3.20 and&#13;
US$23.90 per day, respectively. In the JOBS Creation Project, irrigation and drainage subprojects have&#13;
been the most cost efficient at US$1.54 per day, followed by soil conservation at US$1.82. road&#13;
rehabilitation at US$1.83, and garbage collection at US$1.89.&#13;
3.3    The independent evaluation of the JOBS Creation Project estimated that the net present value&#13;
(NPV) of the irrigation and drainage subprojects is US$15.3 million at a discount rate of 15% and the&#13;
economic rate of return (ERR) is 70%. Road rehabilitation had an NPV of US$4.1 million and an ERR&#13;
of 32%. Soil conservation had an NPV of US$710,000 and an ERR of 23%.&#13;
3.4    Although the JOBS Creation Project benefits were intended to help those at the lowest level of&#13;
subsistence, a wide spectrum of other individuals benefitted as well, including school children, area&#13;
farmers, truck drivers, and small business operators, according to a survey carried out. The amount&#13;
received from the project during a three week period represented 15% of average household cash&#13;
expenditure in the urban areas. Only 16% of those who worked in the project had been previously&#13;
employed in work other than farming. In many cases local vendors established themselves along the job&#13;
sites selling food.  Workers gained increased access to credit due to their employment status.&#13;
Rehabilitated roads resulted in reduced travel time and vehicle operating costs and increased access to&#13;
markets and services, including health and education. Road repairs increased efficiency of travel time&#13;
by 32%. The drainage and irrigation rehabilitation permitted an increase in crop diversity and crop&#13;
yields. The waste management activities contributed to a lower risk of disease in urban centers, although&#13;
these effects have not been quantified. As part of the project's monitoring and evaluation plan. the&#13;
project would finance a study to evaluate direct and indirect economic benefits of project investments.&#13;
TOR for the study are in Annex 2.&#13;
3.5    Social aspects. The project would target the poorest members of the Haitian society. including&#13;
unemployed and women. All the organizations interviewed for the evaluation of the JOBS Creation&#13;
Project said that there were few alternative sources of employment in the project areas. To benefit the&#13;
maximum number of people no one would be employed for more than a month and a half. This targeting&#13;
mechanism would make it less likely that currently employed people would abandon their jobs to work&#13;
for the project. Of the individuals who responded to the surveys carried out during the evaluation, 54%&#13;
said they bought some food with the money, 26% bought a radio, 14% purchased some medicine, 22%&#13;
invested in animals and 22% said they spent some money to pay for schooling. As in the JOBS Creation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Project. the Employment Generation Project would require that a minimum of 20% of all jobs be for&#13;
women. Besides the equity reasons for this targeting there are efficiency considerations as well. Stories&#13;
collected in project sites suggest that women are better savers than men, and that women's salaries are&#13;
more equitably distributed among family members than men's salaries.&#13;
3.6    Environmental aspects. The project has the environmental classification "B." The Credit would&#13;
finance: (a) rehabilitation of roads; (b) rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage works; (c) environmental&#13;
protection (gully control, soil and water conservation); and (c) waste management (urban solid waste&#13;
disposal and clearing of urban waste water ditches). Subprojects would be small with an average cost&#13;
of US$360,000 per project. No new infrastructure would be established. The project would have a&#13;
positive environmental impact, especially through the components dealing with soil conservation and&#13;
waste management.&#13;
3.7    The only activity considered to have possible adverse environmental impacts is waste&#13;
management, which must deal with general issues associated with landfill sites. Creation or expansion&#13;
of landfill sites would be subject to an environmental assessment (EA) satisfactory to IDA, following the&#13;
practice utilized by USAID in the JOBS Creation Project.&#13;
3.8    Each subproject would be subject to simple environmental screening to be carried out by an&#13;
environmiental specialist in the CIU, who would consult with the Minister of Environment on issues raised&#13;
by specific subprojects. A simple environmental checklist would be filled out for each subproject. The&#13;
checklist would evaluate short and long-term impacts and make one of three alternative recommendations:&#13;
(a)    The subproject does not have adverse environmental impacts and can proceed as&#13;
proposed.&#13;
(b)    The subproject has minor adverse environmental impacts and small mitigation measures&#13;
would have to be taken. In this case, the environmental specialist would prepare the&#13;
mitigation measures to the designated counterpart in the PMA.&#13;
(c)    The subproject could have major adverse environmental impacts and an Environmental&#13;
Impact Assessment, acceptable to IDA, would have to be carried out. In this case, the&#13;
environmental specialist would propose the TOR for and supervise the EA. Both the&#13;
TOR and the EA would be cleared by IDA before the subproject could proceed. Based&#13;
on the experience of the Jobs Creation Project, this third case is only expected to occur&#13;
with projects involving the creation of new landfill sites.&#13;
3.9    During negotiations an assurance was obtained that the environmental checklists would be&#13;
completed for each subproject and that an environmental assessment specialist would be contracted by&#13;
the CIU within one month of Credit effectiveness (para.4.2(h)).&#13;
3.10   Sustainability. There are two issues related to sustainability. First, there is the question of the&#13;
sustainability of the works to be rehabilitated under the project, and necessary linkages for their post-&#13;
project maintenance by the responsible sector line agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
3.11   Second, there is the question of the sustainability of the employment generation program itself,&#13;
including whether, in the longer run, such activities should be implemented by a special body such as the&#13;
CIU, and, more broadly, how temporary employment programs should fit, if at all, into an overall&#13;
strategy for poverty alleviation and economic development. Both of these questions would be directly&#13;
addressed by studies and technical assistance in the project's institutional development component. In&#13;
particular, the first half-yearly independent evaluation of the project would focus on these sustainability&#13;
questions (see para.2.43).&#13;
3.12   Summary of project benefits. A detailed list of implementation and impact indicators is in&#13;
Annex 4, Tables I and 2. The project would have four main categories of benefits:&#13;
(a)    Poverty reduction: The project is targeted at the poorest sectors of Haitian society and&#13;
thus it would benefit the poor directly.  Although the jobs created are short term,&#13;
according to past experience part of the wage income would be reinvested in schooling,&#13;
tools, seed, which would have long term impacts. The project would require that 20%&#13;
of all jobs go to women, which are the most disadvantaged group.&#13;
(b)    Sustainability of institutions: By reaching an important share of the population it would&#13;
help sustain expectations about improved governance and help necessary institutions&#13;
develop. Moreover, because implementation is through local lOs, the project would help&#13;
strengthen grassroots organizations.&#13;
(c)    Improved infrastructure: The project would help rehabilitate physical (roads, irrigation,&#13;
drainage) and natural (soils) capital, a key obstacle to economic growth in Haiti.&#13;
Increased economic output at lower cost and increased agricultural productivity would&#13;
generate economic growth and benefit the Haitian economy as a whole.&#13;
(d)    Improved environment: Garbage collection and vector control in urban centers would&#13;
reduce health hazards in population centers, benefitting the urban poor directly and&#13;
reducing health costs in the country.&#13;
3.13   Risks. The project faces many risks. There are political risks that are inevitable in the current&#13;
Haitian context, including possible events adversely affecting project implementation arising from the&#13;
Presidential elections in December 1995 and a change of Government administration in February 1996.&#13;
There are also managerial and technical risks; both the capacity the CIU to implement the project and&#13;
the ability of the sector line agencies to maintain project investments in the post-project period are&#13;
uncertain, although the project will help mitigate these risks through the institutional development&#13;
component. In addition, although PADF has performed well until now, Government recognizes that the&#13;
program is unduly dependent upon the continued participation of this international NGO. However, while&#13;
Government hopes that other organizations will develop the capability to help manage the project in&#13;
addition to PADF, and the project will support this objective, the likelihood of such organizations&#13;
developing this capability in the short term is not certain. Finally, there are risks that the project could&#13;
distort incentives in the local economy; some of the public works to be carried out under the project&#13;
would provide private benefits, such as irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, and could reduce incentives&#13;
for private rehabilitation of such works.&#13;
3.14   Despite these risks, the project should be seen as an intense labor generation effort, with&#13;
immediate and critical short term benefits, which will also help support the development of more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
sustainable approaches in the future. Moreover, the considerable success of the ongoing JOBS Creation&#13;
Project makes it more likely that the proposed project will be successfully implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
IV. Agreements and Recommendation&#13;
4.1    Actions already carried out.&#13;
(a)    Preparation of an independent evaluation of the ongoing USAID-financed JOBS Creation&#13;
Project (para. 1.29).&#13;
(b)    Establishment of PPF financing for the project (para. 2.16).&#13;
(c)    Signing of the first PMA contract, between the CIU and PADF (para. 2.19).&#13;
4.2    Assurances were obtained from the Borrower during negotiations that:&#13;
(a)    The CIU would maintain adequate staff and/or engage consulting firms with qualifications&#13;
and experience satisfactory to IDA to carry out the project (para. 2.18).&#13;
(b)    Contracts with Project Management Agencies would be on terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para. 2.19).&#13;
(c)    Subprojects would be executed on the basis of technical, financial, environmental,&#13;
managerial and other specifications and procedures described in operating manuals&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para. 2.20).&#13;
(d)    Procurement arrangements would be as described in Chapter 2 (para. 2.26).&#13;
(e)    Accounting and auditing arrangements would be as described in Chapter 2 (para. 2.39).&#13;
(f)    Reporting arrangements would be as described in Chapter 2 (para. 2.41).&#13;
(g)    Half-yearly independent evaluations of the project would be carried out as described in&#13;
Chapter 2 (para. 2.42).&#13;
(h)    Environmental checklists would be used as described in Chapter 3 and an environmental&#13;
assessment specialist would be contracted by the CIU within one month of Credit&#13;
effectiveness (para. 3.9).&#13;
4.3    Conditions of disbursement.  Expenditures for subprojects would only be eligible for IDA&#13;
financing if included in a quarterly work program approved by IDA; the first quarterly work program&#13;
would be furnished to IDA within one month of Credit effectiveness (para. 2.33).&#13;
4.4    Recommendation. Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project would&#13;
constitute a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of SDR 31.8 million (US$50 million equivalent) to the&#13;
Republic of Haiti, repayable in 40 years, on standard IDA terms.&#13;

EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PROJECT&#13;
Employment Generation Component&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.    The objective of the Employment Generation Component is to quickly provide short term&#13;
temporary jobs for Haiti's most impoverished people and improve severely deteriorated public&#13;
infrastructure and related services. This component builds directly upon employment generation&#13;
activities financed until now by USAID under the largest component of its JOBS Creation Project,&#13;
and implemented by an international NGO, the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF).&#13;
USAID funds will soon be fully disbursed and Government attaches unusually high priority to&#13;
continuing their Employment Generation Program as a mean to address immediate poverty alleviation&#13;
objectives, particularly during a politically volatile period and while democratic institution are still&#13;
fragile.&#13;
2.    The overall program target is to create about 490,000 person/months of short term work&#13;
employing up to 325,000 people throughout the country in a 13-month period from September 1995&#13;
to September 1996. It is expected that each worker will work an average of 6 weeks. The rate of&#13;
job creation will depend on the rate at which subprojects are selected, planned and implemented.&#13;
Interim targets are as follow:&#13;
Period             Average Persons Working         Work Created&#13;
Each Day                (Person/Month)&#13;
(by PMA)&#13;
Sept 95 - Jan 96                     40,000                     200,000&#13;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  (PADF)&#13;
Feb 96 - July 96                     20,000                     120,000&#13;
(PADF)__               _   _  _   _    _  _&#13;
Oct 96 - Sept 96                     15,000                     167,000&#13;
(other PMAs)&#13;
Total 13 months                   approx 37,000                 487,000&#13;
3.    Implementing Entities. The Government implementing agency will be the Central&#13;
Implementation Unit (CIU) of the Prime Minister's Office. With respect to the Employment&#13;
Generation Program, the CIU's Steering Committee headed by the Prime Minister, and which&#13;
includes the Minister of Planning, the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
any other ministers interested in subproject activities, will be responsible for the overall programming&#13;
approval as well as basic sets of subproject selection criteria. The subproject selection will be made&#13;
jointly by the CIU and the relevant PMA. Eligibility criteria for PMAs include their legal status,&#13;
managerial and administrative capacities, their network of implementing organizations and their job&#13;
creation capacity (see Annex 1, Attachment). The final subproject approval will be the responsibility&#13;
of the CIU which will also be responsible for overall project planning, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
4.    The PMA will in turn enter into agreements with established and recognized local and&#13;
international NGOs and community organizations which will carry out individual subprojects. The&#13;
CIU will be responsible to ensure that appropriate local government officials are informed of the&#13;
program and available to provide support if needed. During project implementation, the PMA will&#13;
work with local governmental entities for identification and planning of subprojects which involve&#13;
government owned infrastructure facilities or government services (such as solid waste disposal).&#13;
Subproject Cycle&#13;
5.    The implementation of the Employment Generation Component will involves the&#13;
identification, selection, preparation, and implementation of specific subprojects. The nature of each&#13;
of these phases is described below.&#13;
a.    Identification&#13;
6.    Potential subprojects would be identified through requests received by the CIU and the PMA&#13;
from local governments, NGOs and community groups. Currently PADF has a list of over one&#13;
hundred requests that could be considered for inclusion in the first tranche of subprojects to be&#13;
financed beginning in September 1995. The institutional development component (see Annex 2)&#13;
would finance a program to provide planning assistance for a limited number of local governments&#13;
that would assist them in the identification and initial prioritization of subprojects to be proposed for&#13;
financing.&#13;
b.    Selection&#13;
7.    Proposals would be initially screened to make sure that they are consistent with the general&#13;
guidelines to be established by the project Steering Committee. These guidelines will establish targets&#13;
for job creation and geographical coverage of the program, and will limit the types of works to be&#13;
considered (currently proposed to be rural roads, irrigation rehabilitation, soil conservation works,&#13;
and garbage collection). Once screened, subprojects would be selected jointly by the CIU and PMA,&#13;
using agreed criteria to select and then prioritize potential subprojects. During negotiations, the&#13;
general guidelines and specific selection criteria were confirmed.  The evaluation criteria for&#13;
subproject selection and prioritization would address the following factors:&#13;
a.    Geographical coveraee: Wide geographical coverage including the poorest sections&#13;
of the country, both rural and urban.&#13;
b.    Capacity of Implementing Organization:  Whether the proposed implementing&#13;
organization has the capacity to manage the administrative and technical aspects of&#13;
the subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
C.    Poverty orientation: Whether the subproject is likely to reach the poor of the region.&#13;
d.    Economic and social utility: A subproject must be useful to the broader community;&#13;
"make work" activities that do not meet a clear need, or subprojects which only&#13;
benefit a few private individuals will not be accepted. Priority will be given to&#13;
subprojects which benefit and employ those most in need.&#13;
e.    Technical soundness: The subproject must be of high technical quality and be&#13;
maintainable after completion.&#13;
f     Labor content:  To maximize the number of jobs created with limited funds,&#13;
preference will be given to subprojects with high labor content. On average, at least&#13;
60% of subproject cost will be for labor.&#13;
g.    Sustainability: Subprojects where local commitment has been demonstrated to finance&#13;
and undertake a maintenance program and to contribute to costs of initial investment.&#13;
h.    Ease and speed of implementation: Simplicity in terms of logistics and technical&#13;
supervision will be an important factor. Preference will be given to subprojects which&#13;
can be completed within one to four months.&#13;
i.    Accountability:  Subprojects must meet GOH and IDA program and resource&#13;
accountability requirements. This will generally require that labor inputs be easily&#13;
measured and verified, and that adequate control of tools and material is assured.&#13;
j.    Environmental screening: Subprojects will be screened for potential environmental&#13;
impact using an IDA approved checklist. Any which fail the screening will be&#13;
excluded.&#13;
8.    The PMA, with the assistance of the CIU, would base its analysis of proposed subprojects on:&#13;
(a) a field review of the organizational, social, technical, and economic aspects of the proposed&#13;
subproject, and (b) previous experience with the proposed implementing agency and with other&#13;
subprojects completed in the same geographical area. Once a subproject has been identified as&#13;
priority for financing, preparation would begin. The infrastructure works, to be carried out under that&#13;
component are intended to either complement and/or extend ongoing infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
efforts. Works are to be labor intensive, of acceptable quality, and utilize sound technical engineering&#13;
standards. Activities undertaken will be simple in their design and execution, and well balanced in&#13;
terms of both its rural/urban mix and women/men employment opportunities.&#13;
c.   -Preparation&#13;
9.    Preparation of the selected subprojects would be conducted by the technical staff of the PMA&#13;
in collaboration with the implementing organization. During this time the PMA would also provide&#13;
training to the implementing organization to prepare its role in ongoing implementation. Procedures&#13;
already established in the PADF component of the USAID JOBS Creation Project would be adopted&#13;
by the Employment Generation Project with modifications to include two additional activities by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
PMA. (a) involvement of local government (the CASECs and Conseils Communales) in reviewing&#13;
and providing input to the plans for the subproject; (b) development of a maintenance strategy with&#13;
the local government, the NGO, and communities involved. The average length of time required for&#13;
subproject preparation would be two to three months.&#13;
d.    Implementation&#13;
10.   Three basic task will be required to implement individual subprojects after they are selected:&#13;
(a) organization and supervision of workers; (b) procurement of tools, equipment, material, and&#13;
services such as transport and technical support; (c) payment of workers and financial accounting.&#13;
Prior to implementing a subproject, the PMA will assess, in close collaboration with the CIU, the&#13;
capability of the local implementing entity to carry out these basic tasks and will adjust its technical&#13;
and institutional support to complement and fill areas of weakness. Generally, the local NGO or&#13;
community organization will be relied on for selecting, organizing and supervising workers and&#13;
financial accounting. This distribution of responsibility may vary according to the experience and&#13;
track record of the local NGO.&#13;
11.   The organizational and technical guidelines and procedures to be used by the implementing&#13;
organizations during implementation would be those which have been established for the PADF&#13;
USAID Jobs Creation program, as modified during project implementation.! These procedures&#13;
detail, for example, the establishment of work groups (20 persons under one chef d'equipe), the&#13;
required minimum participation of women (at least 20% of the work force), mechanisms for&#13;
registering and paying workers, maintenance and reporting of accounts and physical and financial&#13;
progress, and minimal staffing to manage the works (one engineer and one accountant).&#13;
e.    Supervision&#13;
12.   Several levels of project supervision would occur. The PMA would actively supervise both&#13;
the technical and the employment generation aspects of the subproject, through on-site inspectors&#13;
as well as frequent field visits by headquarters technical staff. In accordance with the existing&#13;
procedures of the Jobs Creation program, subproject supervision reports would be completed by&#13;
headquarters technical staff, and the on-site inspectors would visit each work site daily to check&#13;
attendance of registered workers, in an attempt to avoid the "zombie worker" phenomenon.&#13;
Quarterly reporting of the status of project implementation would follow the format outlined in&#13;
Annex 4.&#13;
13.   The CIU would conduct periodic supervision of a sample of the works and maintenance&#13;
programs in order to be able to identify general areas of concern for discussion with the PMA. In&#13;
practice, the CIU may accompany PMA technical staff on some of their supervision visits in order&#13;
to jointly identify and address issues in the field. The CIU would report on project progress to the&#13;
Steering Committee and to the Bank on a quarterly basis.&#13;
' It is anticipated that there will be some modirication of the technical guidelines based on the&#13;
evaluation to be conducted during the first four months of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
f.    Initiation of Maintenance Program&#13;
14.   This phase of activity will apply to subprojects completed before the initiation of the project,&#13;
in an attempt to increase the sustainability of works completed under the USAID JOBS Creation&#13;
Project, as well as to subprojects initiated under the Employment Generation Project. Financing&#13;
would be available from the project to support maintenance activities.&#13;
15.   For works completed by the JOBS Creation Project, the PMA and CIU would review the&#13;
status of these works and identify a priority group of subprojects for initiation of a maintenance&#13;
program. Criteria for selecting these subprojects includes: (a) the existence of capacity and interest&#13;
of the local government, communities and NGO to carry out maintenance activities; and (b) economic&#13;
importance of the work and the likely economic returns on maintenance.&#13;
16.   As works are implemented under the project, technical support would be provided by the&#13;
PMA for the initiation of the maintenance strategy developed during preparation. It is anticipated&#13;
that a number of different models for the management and financing of maintenance would be&#13;
developed, depending on the institutional context of each subproject. Financing for maintenance&#13;
during the first years after implementation would likely include a combination of local resources with&#13;
national resources (to be financed by the project).&#13;
17.   Target beneficiaries. Efforts will be made to ensure that selected workers are among the&#13;
poorest and longest-unemployed people in a given community. The project will seek to provide at&#13;
least one month of employment for each selected worker. In order to spread limited resources&#13;
among a wider group of beneficiaries, the project will generally limit participation of workers to a 1-2&#13;
month maximum for the entire program and to no more than one worker per household. Exceptions&#13;
may be made in the case of skilled workers or supervisors whose continued employment would enable&#13;
a greater level of job creation.&#13;

EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PROJECT&#13;
ELGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PMA/(MDOD)&#13;
Selection of individual PMAs/MDODs will be based, inter alia, on the following&#13;
eligibility criteria:&#13;
1 - Legal status:&#13;
Any non-governmental organizations, national or international, registered and/or&#13;
with all legal authorizations to operate in Haiti.&#13;
2 - Managerial and Administrative Capacities:&#13;

EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PROJECr&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
1.    Objectives. The objectives of the institutional development component would be met through&#13;
the following activities: (a) conduct of an in-field rapid appraisal of employment generation works and&#13;
municipal strengthening activities currently underway to identify areas to be strengthened or modified;&#13;
(b) technical assistance, training and limited office equipment provided to strengthen the capacity of&#13;
implementing organizations; (c) pilot effort to strengthen participatory planning capability of selected&#13;
communal governments and increase their involvement in the employment generation program; (d)&#13;
strengthening of the maintenance of investments by developing maintenance strategies for those&#13;
works that were completed during the JOBS Creation Project as well as those that are being&#13;
implemented by the project; (e) development of long term strategies for building local institutions&#13;
that would have capacity to plan and contract small scale, labor intensive works; (f) establishment of&#13;
a national autonomous non-govemmental entity providing delegated contract management services;&#13;
and (g) review of the Haiti Public Procurement Act.&#13;
2.    Half-year technical, financial, managerial and environmental evaluations and quarterly&#13;
financial audits. The first half-yearly evaluation would include a rapid appraisal of the current&#13;
USAID financed JOBS Creation program and other municipal strengthening efforts under terms of&#13;
reference agreed with IDA, and cover the period ending September 30, 1995. It would look at each&#13;
of the three components of the program, implemented by PADF, Planning Assistance, and&#13;
Cooperative Housing Foundation, respectively. The study would examine a sample of works already&#13;
existing and currently in progress, review the experience of a sample of communal governments, using&#13;
field observations and interviews of program participants, involved communities and NGOs, local&#13;
government officials, as well as PADF staff. The results of the study would provide direct input to&#13;
the project in terms of how technical and other subproject specifications might be improved,&#13;
strategies for more fully involving communal governments in the works program, and strengthen the&#13;
capacity of governments and IOs to enhance sustainability and employment generation aspects of the&#13;
program. These recommendations would provide the bases for other institutional development&#13;
activities under the project.&#13;
3.    To conduct this study, the Government would contract international level consultants (or a&#13;
firm) to form a team of specialized engineers (for rural roads, soil conservation, irrigation, and waste&#13;
management) and community participation specialists (minimum, two). This team would be joined&#13;
by members of the CIU responsible for the project and members of a World Bank supervision&#13;
mission to conduct the field work, analyze results, and develop plans for strengthening the&#13;
employment generation program.&#13;
4.    The details of the methodology and terms of reference for the study would be agreed by the&#13;
Government and IDA by no later than July 30, 1995 and the field work would be initiated by no later&#13;
than August 1995, while the current USAID financed JOBS Creation Project is still in place. See&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Annex 1, TOR 1.&#13;
5.    Capacity building of Implementing Organizations (IOs - NGOs, community associations, and&#13;
commune governments). Capacity building of these organizations would be conducted by the PMA&#13;
and would focus on assisting them to identify, prepare, implement, and, as appropriate, maintain the&#13;
works financed by the project. This effort is a continuation of efforts conducted by PADF under the&#13;
JOBS Creation Project and would involve certain modifications in that approach in order to: (a)&#13;
introduce, where needed, approaches to increase the quality of works by increasing percentage of&#13;
costs going to materials and equipment; (b) achieve greater involvement of local government in&#13;
identification of possible works and, on a pilot basis, as a project implementor; (c) ensure that&#13;
concerns regarding sustainability of subproject benefits are identified and address during the selection&#13;
and preparation phases of subprojects (see para. 7); and (d) to continue and strengthen the&#13;
participation of women in the identification and implementation of subprojects.&#13;
6.    Capacity Building of Local Government. A pilot effort to strengthen participatory planning&#13;
capability of selected communal governments and their capacity to identify, prioritize, and manage&#13;
the implementation of subprojects. Terms of reference for this effort would be developed and agreed&#13;
with IDA and the technical assistance would be contracted by no later than November 1995. Plans&#13;
for this subcomponent would build on the experience of a number of government offices and NGOs&#13;
currently working in Haiti to increase the decentralization of authority to local government and&#13;
strengthen the capacity of the communal government, the new Communal Councils, and the&#13;
communal sections (CASECs). Technical assistance would also include governance issues to enhance&#13;
responsiveness to high priority poverty groups through participatory methods.&#13;
7.    Strategy for Works Maintenance. The procedures for selection and implementation of&#13;
subprojects would be strengthened by including a requirement that the PMA work with the&#13;
communities, NGOs and communal governments to identify feasible maintenance strategies and&#13;
programs. In addition, the PMA would be asked to follow-up on works completed prior to&#13;
September 1995 (financed under the JOBS Creation Project) to assist communities and local&#13;
governments in the development of maintenance programs. Financing of a percentage of the cost&#13;
of maintenance for these works would be acceptable, once agreement has been reached with IDA&#13;
on the maintenance strategy. In the development of a maintenance strategy for rural roads, the&#13;
current rural roads maintenance program of the MTPTC and the CASEC-level road maintenance&#13;
program promoted by Planning Assistance would be reviewed to ensure that strategies adopted by&#13;
the project would benefit from those experiences and be consistent with sector guidelines.&#13;
8.    Development of Long Term Institutional Strategies. The project would include technical&#13;
assistance designed to assist government to develop and implement long term strategies for building&#13;
local institutions that would have capacity to manage labor intensive investments that would address&#13;
priority economic development needs (especially for rural roads, soil conservation and irrigation&#13;
rehabilitation) and provide temporary employment for economically depressed areas/populations.&#13;
This would include the development of an institution to serve as a delegated contract management&#13;
agent (e.g., as in the AGETIP model), especially for small scale, labor intensive works. Clarification&#13;
and selection among potential strategies for longer term institutional development would be assisted&#13;
by the analysis of the existing employment program (para. 2). Within the first six months of the&#13;
project the CIU, with the assistance of specialized consultants, would develop a statement of strategy&#13;
for this effort, with implementation taking place during the second half of the project.&#13;

equipment and incremental recurrent costs to strengthen the capacity of the CIU to assume its role&#13;
in the supervision and management of the project.&#13;
10.   Review of the Haiti Public Procurement Act A preliminary review of the Haitian Public&#13;
Procurement Act has shown that the Act needs revision. It is an adaptation of the French&#13;
Procurement act that does not take into account the needs for expediting some processes in view of&#13;
Haiti's developmental needs. A detailed study may identify the main issues and options that the&#13;
Government could include in a revised Act to be submitted to Parliament. The CIU has been&#13;
exempted from this Act.&#13;

Decentralization Policies and Structure of&#13;
Local Government in Haiti&#13;
1.    The country is divided into nine Departments encompassing 135&#13;
Communes which are in turn subdivided into 565 Sections Communales. In the&#13;
chart below are presented the elected and appointed bodies at the Department.&#13;
Commune and Section levels. The Departments are also divided into 40&#13;
Arrondissement each consisting of three to five Communes, but this&#13;
administrative level functions only as an extension of the central government&#13;
offices of the Department. The chart below summarizes the structure of&#13;
government at the Department and below levels.&#13;
2.    Prior to the 1987 Constitution, all Departmental and Communal Sections&#13;
posts were appointments of the central government. The 1987 Constitution&#13;
requires popular election for Sectional Councils (CASECs) as well as Communal&#13;
Councils, although currently many of these posts are filled by appointment.&#13;
Elections are to be held on June 25 with runoffs in July 1995 through which the&#13;
national and local representative bodies will be selected. The procedure for&#13;
selecting the Assemblee Departmental will likely be through a process of&#13;
selection by the local government elected officials.&#13;
3.    Elections for the Communal Councils and the CASECs are done on a&#13;
party slate basis, with voters voting for a slate of three candidates in each case.&#13;
The Communal Assemblies were newly created by the 1987 Constitution and will&#13;
include the members of the Communal Council, the CASECs, and other&#13;
representatives of local communities. It is through the Communal Assembly that&#13;
the Government intends planning for economic development and social services&#13;
is to take place.&#13;
4.    Local government (communal) revenues have been extremely limited.&#13;
Local governments are almost completely dependent on transfers from the&#13;
Departments, which generally cover only basic operating costs (principally salaries&#13;
of municipal workers). Since the communal government is dependent on the&#13;
central administration for these transfers, much control still resides in the central&#13;
government and its local representatives. Reform of the fiscal and other powers&#13;
of local government is expected to occur with the passage of a new local&#13;
government law.&#13;

special group in the Prime Minister's office to coordinate efforts to promote&#13;
decentralization and urban development. In addition, the UN Habitat Agency&#13;
and Planning Assistance, a US NGO working within the USAID's JOBS Creation&#13;
Project, have maintained active programs providing assistance to both rural and&#13;
urban local governments.&#13;

Half-Yearly Evaluations&#13;
1.    The CIU would contract consultants to carry out half-yearly evaluations, covering technical,&#13;
financial, managerial and environmental aspects, to ascertain whether the project objectives are being&#13;
achieved, identify issues and make recommendations for improvements. The evaluations will cover&#13;
the activities of the CIU, PMAs and IOs, including local governments, and linkages to line ministries.&#13;
They will be carried out for the periods ending September 30 and March 31 each year, to be&#13;
submitted to IDA within 60 days of these periods. The evaluations will assess:&#13;
a.    Technical Aspects: whether adequate technical specifications are being applied, and&#13;
whether these are in accordance with industry standards nationally and internationally for similar&#13;
works and activities, and if the institutional development plans are being carried out in accordance&#13;
to the agreed guidelines.&#13;
b.    Financial Aspects: the opinions of the quarterly audits, including for SOEs and Special&#13;
Account, and longer term issues associated with the financial management and reporting of the&#13;
project.&#13;
c.    Managerial Aspects: the capacity of the CIU, PMAs and IOs to manage their activities&#13;
in accordance to project objectives in an efficient manner. The institutional development component&#13;
would be particularly relevant because the CIU would manage the activities directly.&#13;
d.    Environmental Aspects: whether the environmental assessments are being carried out&#13;
by the CIU in the agreed data sheets, and if the recommended mitigating actions (if any) are being&#13;
carried out.&#13;
2.    In addition to the above general TOR, which would guide each half-yearly evaluation, during&#13;
the first half-yearly evaluation, covering the period ending September 30, 1995, particular emphasis&#13;
would be given to a rapid appraisal of employment generation and municipal strengthening efforts,&#13;
as discussed on the following page.&#13;

Rapid Appraisal of Employment Generation and&#13;
Municipal Strengthening Efforts&#13;
The first half-yearly evaluation, covering the period ending September 30, 1995, and due to&#13;
be completed by November 1995, will be carried out by a team of independent consultants working&#13;
with members of the CIU and a special World Bank mission. In addition to the general TOR&#13;
applicable to all half-yearly evaluations, the first half-yearly evaluation would address, inter ali, the&#13;
following questions:&#13;
(a)   What has been the technical quality and sustainability of each category of works and&#13;
services provided (i.e. rural roads rehabilitation, soil conservation, irrigation&#13;
rehabilitation, and waste management) and, if relevant, what are the specific strategies&#13;
or practices that might be employed to strengthen quality and sustainability?&#13;
(b)   What regions and groups have benefitted the most from the employment program and&#13;
from the works themselves? Has targeting to the poor been successful? How might&#13;
targeting be improved?&#13;
(c)   What has been the experience with the participation of women (which have made up&#13;
approximately 20% of the work force) and are there ways their participation may be&#13;
increased?&#13;
(d)   What has been the effect of the increase in salary paid to unskilled workers from 20&#13;
Gourdes to 36 Gourdes per day in terms of its impact on targeting and the local&#13;
economy? Are any mitigating measures necessary?&#13;
(e)   What have been the results of efforts to strengthen local government planning and&#13;
involvement in labor-intensive, employment creation works programs, and what would&#13;
be the most effective strategies for increasing such involvement in the present&#13;
project?&#13;
(f)    What has the been the experience of increasing the beneficiary contribution by&#13;
requiring one day of free labor for each five days of paid labor?&#13;
(g)   What are the characteristics of the AGETIP-model that could be used in developing&#13;
the model for the Haitian PMA(s) to be established under the project?&#13;
(h)   What measures could be taken to strengthen the rural roads unit linked to the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications, which could adopt&#13;
approaches tested and proven by the JOBS Creation Project, with future employment&#13;
generation programs related to roads handled by this unit in conjunction with local&#13;
authorities?&#13;
(i)    What measures could be taken to strengthen soil conservation and irrigation/drainage&#13;

EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PROGRAM&#13;
Summary Terms of Reference&#13;
Economic Evaluation of Project Investments&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    This study is an input to the GOH strategy for employment generation&#13;
in economically depressed areas. The objective is to calculate the economic&#13;
benefits from labor intensive small scale projects in order to identify those&#13;
projects that contribute most to the local economy. The study will use the&#13;
experience of the USAID/PADF Jobs Creation Project and of the proposed&#13;
Employment Generation Project to carry out an economic analysis of&#13;
alternative types of labor intensive projects.&#13;
Methods&#13;
2.    The study would focus on the four categories of projects financed by&#13;
the Employment Generation Project: (a) road rehabilitation; (b) rehabilitation&#13;
of irrigation and drainage canals; (c) soil conservation; and (d) urban waste&#13;
management. The analysis should also include any other, still unidentified,&#13;
candidate categories of labor-intensive small scale projects.&#13;
3.    The analysis would be based on a representative and significant sample&#13;
of projects within each category. Local information on physical inputs and&#13;
outputs for each project and local costs and prices would be collected through&#13;
field surveys and from the data bases of implementing PMAs and IOs.&#13;
3.    The full range of economic costs and benefits of the projects would be&#13;
measured, both for each individual project and for the aggregate program,&#13;
including the indirect costs and benefits from any possible price changes&#13;
induced by the magnitude of the program.&#13;
4.    General. Results should be presented in terms of fiscal costs per job&#13;
created, Net Present Value, and Economic Rate of Retum. The average cost&#13;
of capital to the Haitian Government should be used as a proxy for the&#13;
economic discount rates in the calculations. The costs should include carefully&#13;
constructed measures of the opportunity costs of the various inputs, including&#13;
appropriate shadow wage rates, reflecting the opportunity costs of the&#13;
unemployed. In particular the analysis should consider the negative impacts, if&#13;
any, on general economic activity, of bid-up wages by the program, if there is&#13;
market evidence that this happens.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
TOR 2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
5.    Rural Roads. The analysis should include as benefits measure(s) of the&#13;
reduction in travel time, reduction in vehicle operating costs, increased rents to&#13;
farmers, other producers and real estate owners due to improved access to&#13;
markets and public services, and of any other variables identified as important,&#13;
such as consumer and producer surpluses from indirect local price changes&#13;
brought about by improved roads.&#13;
6.    Irrigation and drainage. The analysis should include the increased net&#13;
value of crop production from irrigation due to improved irrigation and&#13;
drainage on irrigated farms and due to the new farms that became irrigated.&#13;
The analysis should also consider any possible change in cropping patterns&#13;
expected from improved irrigation. Finally the analysis should consider the&#13;
consumer and producer surpluses from indirect local price changes, in&#13;
particular due to the increased food supply.&#13;
7.    Soil conservation. The analysis should measure both the on-farm and&#13;
off-farm benefits from lower erosion and lower water peak discharges and&#13;
flooding. Specifically in terms of on-farm benefits the analysis should&#13;
measure the increased net revenues due to gains in soil fertility and in terms of&#13;
off-farm benefits the gains to productive infrastructure downstream due to&#13;
increased lifespans, fewer accidents, lower maintenance costs, or alternative&#13;
measures.&#13;
8.    Waste Management. The analysis would measure the value of the&#13;
gains in public health due to the garbage collection and sanitation activities,&#13;
the gain in real estate values from cleaner streets and sewage systems, or&#13;
alternative measures that capture the economic benefits of the activity.&#13;
Outputs&#13;
9.    The consultants would produce three outputs:&#13;
(1)   A preliminary methodological report proposing the sample size,&#13;
exact physical and economic variables to be measured, and data&#13;
collection methods and sources.&#13;
(2)   A draft report including the results of the economic analysis.&#13;
(3)   A final report fine tuning the economic analysis, making&#13;
recommendations for future labor intensive small scale projects,&#13;
and including comments from the GOH and outside reviewers.&#13;
Duration&#13;
10.   The study would last 3 months, with report (1) due after 3 weeks,&#13;
report (2) after 9 weeks, and report (3) after 12 weeks.&#13;

Qualifications&#13;
11.   The study team would include one economist, one engineer and one&#13;
agronomist or equivalent. The economist would have at least 10 years of&#13;
international experience on benefit-cost analysis and related topics, while the&#13;
engineer and agronomist would have at least 5 years experience with projects&#13;
of this kind in Haiti.&#13;

Project Reporting&#13;
1.    Because of the large number of subprojects distributed throughout the country and&#13;
implemented in a short time, good project monitoring and reporting will be critical for project&#13;
management.&#13;
2.    At the subproject level, responsibilities of the Implementing Organizations (the local NGOs&#13;
and community organizations) with respect to reporting are specified in the contracts between the&#13;
IOs and the PMA(s).&#13;
3.    At the national level, the CIU and the PMA(s) would regularly collect and analyze data on&#13;
key indicators to monitor progress in physical execution and assess project impact, comparing the&#13;
results with the pre-project estimates. The quarterly reports would both describe progress in project&#13;
execution, and identify possible implementation issues and propose appropriate solutions.&#13;
4.    During appraisal, the existing PADF format for quarterly reporting for the JOBS Creation&#13;
Project was reviewed and found to be a satisfactory basis for reporting under the Employment&#13;
Generation Project.&#13;
5.    The outline of the PADF quarterly report is:&#13;
(a)   Introductory text, consisting of sections on:&#13;
General information&#13;
Forecast for reporting period and actual accomplishments&#13;
Factors financing implementation&#13;
Projections for the next quarter&#13;
(b)   Summary table on program status as of end of reporting period&#13;
(c)    Graph on status of programmed projects&#13;
(d)   Graph on budgets vs. advances by subproject type&#13;
(e)   Tables on status of subprojects in execution&#13;
A.    Road rehabilitation&#13;
B.    Irrigation and drainage&#13;
C.    Soil conservation&#13;
D.    Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(f)   Graph on person months completed to date vs. programmed person months remaining&#13;
(g)   Graph on person months achieved by gender and combined&#13;
(h)   Graph on number of people who have worked by gender and combined&#13;
(i)    Graphs on person month data by subproject type&#13;
(j)   Table on subprojects currently being studied for implementation&#13;
6.    In addition to this information on the Employment Generation Component, the CIU quarterly&#13;
report would include the following sections on the Institutional Development Component.&#13;
(a)   Technical Assistance&#13;
(b)   Training&#13;
(c)   Studies&#13;
(d)   Financial'budget indicators&#13;
(e)   Status of compliance with legal covenants&#13;
(f)   Overall progress against implementation indicators&#13;
(g)   Overall progress against impact indicators&#13;
7.    Attached are the following tables to be included in the quarterly report:&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Employment Generation Project will
            provide short term employment to people in extreme poverty
            in support of the Government's programs for poverty
            alleviation. By doing so, the project will continue to
            support for job creation efforts undertaken since 1993, and
            achieve other objectives including the improvement of
            seriously deteriorated economic and productive
            infrastructure. In addition, the project will strengthen the
            capacity of national and local government, nongovernmental
            organizations and local community organizations to manage
            employment-intensive small scale development projects in the
            future. The project will have an employment generation
            component as well as an institutional development component.
