ABSTRACT OF TH4E STUDY&#13;
This paper examines the distribution of primary school enrollments&#13;
within and among the countries of the Eastern Africa Region.&#13;
In a first phase, the study makes inter-country comparisons that&#13;
indicate which countries and which areas in the Region lag in terms of&#13;
educational opportunities. Thereafter, the focus of the paper shifts from&#13;
the Region as a whole to the individual countries. Two basic questions are&#13;
asked: (a) What is the overall degree of inequality in the distr:Lbution of&#13;
primary school enrollments across the districts and between the sexes within&#13;
a country?; and (b) which specific districts and urban vs. rural 'Locations, or&#13;
sex groups within these areas, fall below, or above, the national average in&#13;
their enrollments and by how much? Two countries, Lesotho and Sudan, representing&#13;
the full range of relatively equal and unequal cases, are reviewed in more depth.&#13;
Finally, the paper attempts to determine how and where t:o allocate&#13;
educational investments in order to reduce both inter-country and intra-country&#13;
inequities.&#13;
The study draws exclusively on the large amounts of routine annual&#13;
statistics gathered by countries and emphasizes the use of simple, computer&#13;
generated indicators to reduce the data into readable form.&#13;

DISTRIBUTION OF PRIMARY SCHOOL ENROLLMENTS IN EASTERN AFRICA&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.      A major goal of both Bank Group lending policy and Borrower&#13;
development policy is to promote the participation in economic development&#13;
of people who exist on the margins of their societies. The causes of their&#13;
marginality are various: illiteracy, lack of cash income, or simply dis-&#13;
tance from the main centers and arteries of economic activity and service&#13;
delivery, to name only the more obvious ones. Among the various sectors in&#13;
which Bank Group investments are regularly made, education is one which is&#13;
expected to play a major role in promoting equal participation in economic&#13;
development. In the education sector the policy goal of promoting equity&#13;
usually means extending basic education opportunities to those who lack&#13;
them. This typically occurs in one of two ways - either providing more&#13;
adult education programs to low income adults, or investing in formal&#13;
primary education in regions, districts, or communities which do not have&#13;
basic educational facilities. Adult education programs provide the pos-&#13;
sibility of rapid benefits such as raising yields for small farmers,&#13;
increasing awareness of new techniques, creating a family planning con-&#13;
sciousness, or broadening participation in community affairs. However, the&#13;
social equity effects of opening primary school opportunities to new target&#13;
populations are potentially more profound. This study has therefore chosen&#13;
to concentrate exclusively on the distribution of primary school enroll-&#13;
ments within a number of Eastern Africa countries.(l)&#13;
2.      Within that context the study seeks to answer only a few of the&#13;
many questions that can be raised. In a first, descriptive phase it&#13;
attempts to answer two basic questions:&#13;
(a) What is the overall degree of inequality in the distribution of&#13;
primary school enrollments across the districts and sex lines within a&#13;
country?, and&#13;
(b) which specific areas, or sex groups within these areas, fall&#13;
below or above the national average in their enrollments and by how much?&#13;
1. Eastern Africa Region is defined by the World Bank to include: Botswana,&#13;
Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,&#13;
Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda,&#13;
Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In this study, the Southern Region of the&#13;
Sudan is treated as though it were a separate country, in addition to being&#13;
a part of the Sudan as a whole. This is because primary education in the&#13;
Southern Region has distinct characteristics and is, in fact, administered&#13;
semi-autonomously by the Southern Regional Government in Juba.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
The first question will be answered by the use of Gini coefficients and&#13;
Lorenz curves. The second question will be answered mainly by the use of&#13;
representation indices (RI), enrollment participation rates (PAR), and&#13;
pyramid ratios (PYR). These indices will be defined below.&#13;
3.      At first, the study stresses inter-country comparisons, devetloping&#13;
some possible generalizations and "normal" ranges of inequality for the&#13;
Eastern Africa Region. This comparison indicates which countries and which&#13;
groups/areas-in the Region lag in terms of distribution of educational&#13;
opportunities. Subsequently, the focus of the study shifts from the Region&#13;
as a whole to the individual countries, thus adding a micro-perspective&#13;
to the overview. The country analysis will be limited to two country case&#13;
studies. -The two selected countries, Sudan and Lesotho, represent situa-&#13;
tions of (relatively) extreme inequity and equity in the distribution of&#13;
educational opportunities. These case studies illustrate the enormous&#13;
potential for further intra-country analyses which can be found in the&#13;
annex material of the study. Finally, the study performs an exercise in&#13;
determining how and where to allocate educational investments to raise&#13;
primary enrollments in the most under-represented areas of the few most&#13;
under-represented countries in the Region, and thereby make significant&#13;
reductions both in inter-country inequality and in intra-country inequality&#13;
in the poorest countries.&#13;
4.        The study concentrates on the practical concerns of educat:Lonal&#13;
planners who are faced with the immediate task of alleviating an unequal&#13;
distribution of school resources and opportunites. Each year almost every&#13;
nation collects vast numbers of enrollment figures successively broken down&#13;
by grade, by sex and by district and sub-district. Considerable manpower&#13;
is absorbed in this data collection, tabulation and presentation effort.&#13;
But after the publication of the aggregated numbers, insufficient use is&#13;
made of this mountain of statistics.(2) This underutilization is partly&#13;
explainable by the sheer quantity of numbers. Some method of reducing&#13;
large series of numbers into ratios or other Lndices is needed, but that&#13;
process has, at least until the advent of computerized data processing,&#13;
only added to the expenditure of scarce manpoiwer.  This study, therefore,&#13;
is a first attempt to see how much more planniLng value can be extracted&#13;
from the most routinely collected educational statistics, without collect-&#13;
ing one additional fresh datum.   The data rediu"ction for the study was&#13;
performed on a new computer program developed by World Bank Computing&#13;
2. The-reliability of the statistical data used in this study is certainly&#13;
not absolute. However, the comparative nature, of the study does not&#13;
require perfect accuracy of the statistical material, as the study int:ends&#13;
to provide an indication of relative levels of inequity in the distribution&#13;
of educational opportunities in Eastern Africa, rather than to determi.ne&#13;
absolute inequity coefficients.&#13;

School Location/Allocation Planning System (SLP).&#13;
5.      For the education planner concerned primarily with one country,&#13;
each country data set will give him a review of the inequality in the&#13;
distribution of enrollments and the pyramid shape of enrollments within&#13;
each district, by sex. It will also indicate him where and to what extent&#13;
to increase enrollment in order to reduce optimally the existing ineq-&#13;
uities. For World Bank management and staff in the Eastern African Region,&#13;
one of the major contributions of the study is the determination of&#13;
Region-specific norms and ranges of inequality. By generating Gini coeffi-&#13;
cients summarizing the unequal distributions of school places in each&#13;
country, we can begin to have a feel for what is relatively "normal" and&#13;
what is "extreme inequality" in the distribution of primary school oppor-&#13;
tunities in the countries of Eastern Africa. With this new information we&#13;
can better determine when and when not to raise unequal distribution as an&#13;
issue. At this time, when the need to maintain financial solvency is&#13;
tending to push aside other development goals in many African countries,&#13;
it is more important than ever to develop tools and criteria to determine&#13;
when equity should be retained as a relevant goal.&#13;
Indices for Measuring Educational Equity&#13;
6.      The main tools for identifying areas of advantage and disadvantage&#13;
and for assessing the degree of inequality across a country are the RI and&#13;
the Gini Coefficient.&#13;
A. Representation Index (RI)&#13;
7.      The RI indicates whether a given group or area is under-or&#13;
over-represented, and to what degree, with respect to the distribution of a&#13;
scarce resource. For example, in education, a district can be under-or&#13;
over-represented in its particular share of school places compared to its&#13;
proportion of the relevant school-going age group. In arithmetical terms,&#13;
for any district which is a sub-set of the whole set (usually a country),&#13;
(a)  RI  = e    E&#13;
p: P&#13;
where  E  is total, national enrollment,&#13;
P is total, national relevant age Â§roup population,&#13;
e is the number enrolled in the it district,&#13;
p is the number in the relevant age group&#13;
population in the ith district.&#13;
Or, in plain language, for each district:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
RI = Percent of scarce resource, e.g., enrollment&#13;
Percent of distribution basis, e.g., population&#13;
Thus, for example, a district with 20% of primary school enrollment in the&#13;
nation but 30% of the age group in the nation would have an RI of&#13;
20% = 0.67&#13;
30%&#13;
Indices over 1.0 indicate over-representation; indices below 1.0 indicate&#13;
under-representation. With respect to school enrollments specifically,&#13;
another way to define a district's RI is to divide its enrollment rate&#13;
by the national enrollment rate. So, for example,&#13;
(b)  RI  = e    Pi&#13;
E  :P&#13;
Or, again, in plairt language:&#13;
RI  = Enrollment rate of district&#13;
Enrollment rate of country&#13;
Either way, the resulting RI values will be identical for any given district.&#13;
B. Gini Coefficient&#13;
8.      Whereas the RI is a measure of comparaitive disadvantage for one&#13;
group or area, the Gini coefficient is a single statistic&#13;
summarizing relative inequality across all groups or areas at once.    It is&#13;
commonly used by economists to measure inequality between income groups,&#13;
but it is equally useful in portraying unequal distributions of other&#13;
scarcities across groups in a population.&#13;
9.      The simplest way to understand the Gini coefficient is to begLn&#13;
by plotting the shaLres of enrollment and population for four districts&#13;
(to keep it simple) on a two-dimension space cr "x, y" axis, as in the&#13;
following table and graph.&#13;

11.     If one begins with the district with the lowest RI, and cumula-&#13;
tively plots enrollment share against population share, district by dis-&#13;
trict, one arrives at a so-called "Lorenz" curve of concentration bulging&#13;
below the diagonal. (Were all districts to have exactly proportional&#13;
representation, indicating absolute equality, the plot would follow the&#13;
diagonal precisely). The Gini coefficient (G), then, is equal to the&#13;
shaded area, A, between the diagonal and the curve, as a percentage of the&#13;
whole area of the right triangle below the diagonal, or A + B. The Gini&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
coefficient can be computed by hand by proceeding with the following steps,&#13;
using the same simplified example as above, adhering to the same district&#13;
order, but expressing percents as decimals:&#13;

Share of      |    Sumi of      | Products of&#13;

District | (same as col.(a)) l(refer to col.(d)l      (f) (g)&#13;
I    i       0.40         I       0.20      |     0.080&#13;
II     I      0.10         |       0.50       |    0.050&#13;
III     |      0.25         |       0.90      |     0.225&#13;
IV    I       0.25         I       1.60      |     0.400&#13;
Total                                                 0.755&#13;
G = 1 -   0.7555 = 0.245&#13;
12.     The range of possible Gini coefficients is from 0.0, representing&#13;
absolute proportionality or equality, up to 1.0 representing complete&#13;
monopoly or inequality. This is the hypothetical situation when one person&#13;
monopolizes the entire supply of a scarcity. lIn the real world, however, a&#13;
Gini coefficient on primary education will only rarely go above 0.5.&#13;
13.     It has to be recalled that the Gini c6efficient is only a measure&#13;
of relative inequality, and does not provide an indication of the absolute&#13;
levels of provision of a social service or eco!nomic good. Specifical:ly,&#13;
an ideal Gini coefficient of 0.0 means that the available resources oi: a&#13;
country are perfectly distributed, but does certainly not mean that&#13;
everybody is well endowed with those resources.   The least advantaged&#13;
population groups or regions in a country with an extremely inequitable&#13;
distribution of a specific good may be better off in absolute terms than&#13;
the most advantaged population groups or regions in a country with a highly&#13;
equitable distribution of that good. It is therefore essential that Gini&#13;
coefficients are always confronted with indicators of absolute provision,&#13;
i.e., with ordinary enrollment participation rates (PAR).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
C. Pyramid Rate and Index&#13;
14.     A pyramid rate for a district in a country and the country as a&#13;
whole, is the enrollment in any upper grade as a percent of enrollment in&#13;
the first grade of a cycle. When a district's pyramid rate is divided by&#13;
the national pyramid rate, a pyramid index is obtained. The lower the&#13;
pyramid rate in a district, the greater its "slope," which may in many&#13;
circumstances be taken to indicate high rates of attrition in the upper&#13;
grades. The main exception is when enrollment in the base grades are&#13;
suddenly extended due to a recent introduction of universal primary educa-&#13;
tion, e.g., in Tanzania in recent years.&#13;
Techniques in Planning for Redistribution&#13;
15.     The study examines the sensitivity of the above indices of unequal&#13;
distribution to planned increases in enrollment. For this exercise, the&#13;
existing enrollment in each Eastern African country is increased by a&#13;
target amount which is then allocated to the different regions or districts&#13;
of the country such as to maximize the reduction of educational&#13;
inequities.(3) This exercise is performed (on SLP) by the following steps.&#13;
First, a target increment in national primary enrollment is selected, in&#13;
this case 10% of the existing enrollment.(4) This incremental amount is&#13;
then allocated to the poorest districts through a "bump-up" technique. The&#13;
procedure begins by rank-ordering all districts by their respective RI's&#13;
for all grades combined. Beginning with the district with the lowest RI,&#13;
enrollment places are added to this district to "bump" it up until its RI&#13;
reaches the RI level of the district with the second lowest RI. Then both&#13;
of these districts are bumped together up to the RI level of the third&#13;
lowest district and so on until the target increment is exhausted. There-&#13;
upon, a revised Gini coefficient and revised representation indices are&#13;
calculated and compared to the initial values of the indicators to show&#13;
their sensitivity to such an increase. The exercise identifies the dis-&#13;
tricts in which enrollment should be increased and by what specific&#13;
amounts. In addition, the equity effect of the enrollment increase is&#13;
quantified. Tables 1, 4 and 5 summarize some of the results of this "bump&#13;
up" exercise.&#13;
3. This hypothetical planning exercise is done for each country in the&#13;
Eastern Africa Region, but also for the Region as a whole.&#13;
4. A 10% increase in enrollments seems unrealistic in certain Eastern&#13;
African countries. The high figure has been chosen for theoretical pur-&#13;
poses, as it provides a better idea of how school places should eventually&#13;
be allocated. A more realistic increment of 1.5% has been used in a later&#13;
section dealing with concrete policy guidelines for the Eastern Africa&#13;
Region.&#13;

16.     The "bump up" technique is not without limitations.   The technique&#13;
allocates school places wherever disparities are the greatest. However,&#13;
the districts with the lowest RI's undoubtedlly have them for real, iden-&#13;
tifiable reasons: demographic, historical, geographic, and especially,&#13;
financial. The trade off, at a given cost, between adding more school&#13;
places, which probably means adding to already advantaged areas, and mini-&#13;
mizing overall inequities, but at a probably higher unit cost, is in the&#13;
final analysis a political issue without an obvious solution.&#13;
17.     For each of the 16 Eastern Africa ccountries in the study, four&#13;
standard matrices with enrollment and population data, by grade or age,&#13;
were prepared in the following sequence: (a) males only, (b) females only,&#13;
(c) both sexes mixed, and (d) total males and then females shown separately&#13;
within each district. Thus in matrices (a), (b) and (c) the number of rows&#13;
of each matrix is equal to the number of districts, while in (d) it is&#13;
double that number. Extracts of key indicators from these matrices,&#13;
together with maps and Lorenz Curves are arranged by country and placed in&#13;
the Annex. For the education planner concerned primarily with one country,&#13;
each country data set will give him a review of inequality in distribution&#13;
of enrollments and the pyramid shape of enrollments within each district,&#13;
by sex.&#13;
The Findings - Highlights&#13;
18.     The main finding of the study is that the degree of inequality in&#13;
the distribution of educational opportunities varies enormously from one&#13;
Eastern African country to another. Some countries enjoy a highly propor-&#13;
tional distribution, whereas other countries experience enormous dis-&#13;
parities in the allocation of enrollment places among districts, between&#13;
the urban and rural areas and between the sexes.&#13;
19.     The top section of Table 1 (pg 11) shows the Gini coefficients for&#13;
the internal distribution of enrollments in 1.6 countries, and for each of&#13;
the four matrix sets within them. The range of Gini coefficients in the&#13;
total male plus female matrix, before the incremental allocation by&#13;
bump-up, goes from a low of 0.06 for Swaziland to a high of 0.558 for the&#13;
Southern Sudan, i.e. a very wide range by a factor of nearly 10.    In trying&#13;
to identify the types of countries which fall at either end of the range,&#13;
it is useful to correlate Gini coefficients a'nd the gross national enroll-&#13;
ment rates(5) shown in the last column of Table 1. The strong inverse&#13;
5. In the analysis of the participation rates, it has to be recalled that&#13;
the length of the primary school cycle differs from country to country in&#13;
Eastern Africa.  Whereas the cycle includes 8jgrades in Malawi, it has only&#13;
6 grades in Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Zaire and Burundi, and only 5 grades&#13;
in Madagascar. However, as pointed out later in the report, these latter&#13;
countries (with the exception of Zaire and Maidagascar), even with a shorter&#13;
primary school cycle, have the lowest enrollment rates in the Region, thus&#13;
reinforcing the conclusions of this study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
relationship between the two indices (r = -.76) can be seen clearly in the&#13;
scatter plot in Figure 1: countries with relatively high national par-&#13;
ticipation rates have a relatively more equal distribution of enrollments,&#13;
i.e. a low Gini coefficient; countries with relatively low national enroll-&#13;
ments, have a relatively less equal distribution of enrollments, e.g. a&#13;
high Gini coefficient. In other words, the degree of relative inequity in&#13;
the allocation of educational opportunities is negatively correlated to the&#13;
absolute level of provision of the social service. Both elements are, in&#13;
fact, mutually reinforcing.(6)&#13;
20.     Those countries with higher participation rates, i.e. above 50%,&#13;
have Gini coefficients ranging from a low of 0.06 for Swaziland(7) to a&#13;
high of 0.252 for Malawi.(8) At the opposite end of the range, countries&#13;
with low national enrollment rates have Gini coefficients starting from a&#13;
low of 0.363 for the Sudan and reaching 0.558 for the Southern Region of&#13;
the Sudan. These highly inequal internal distributions are most likely due&#13;
to the weak penetration of civil authority from the administrative core to&#13;
the periphery. The case of the Southern Sudan tends to demonstrate this&#13;
syndrome as the highest RIs are concentrated on Juba and Malakal, two&#13;
important administrative centers. The enrollment rate in Juba is actually&#13;
over 100% while in several remote districts it is between 5% and 7%, and&#13;
even as low as 1% for females alone in some districts (See Annex). In fact&#13;
the level of development of general education in the Southern Sudan as a&#13;
whole appears to be at least three decades behind the average of the East-&#13;
ern Africa Region.&#13;
6. The international use of the Gini coefficient and RI index is of inter-&#13;
est in a relatively homogeneous region such as East Africa. In a more&#13;
diverse region such as North Africa, where GNP per capita ranges from&#13;
US$460 in Egypt to US$1,120 in Tunisia (figures for 1979), those coeffi-&#13;
cients should be interpreted with care. For example, the use of school age&#13;
children for farm labor is probably higher in rural areas in Egypt than in&#13;
rural areas of Tunisia, where agriculture is more highly mechanized. This,&#13;
ceteris paribus, reduces enrollment rates in Egypt in relation to Tunisia.&#13;
7. On the surface, the Gini coefficients suggest that Swaziland has&#13;
achieved the most equal distribution in enrollment places. This is partly&#13;
misleading. Swaziland has only four districts, while Tanzania has 92&#13;
districts. In computing Ginis, the fewer the number of districts, other&#13;
things being equal, the lower the Gini. Swaziland and Tanzania are the&#13;
extreme opposites in number of districts. If we were to aggregate the&#13;
Tanzanian data into four super-districts, its resulting Gini coefficient&#13;
would be closer to Swaziland's.&#13;
8. In the somewhat anomalous case of Malawi, the high Gini coefficient and&#13;
the low national enrollment rate can partially be explained by the excep-&#13;
tional length of the primary school cycle, eight years.&#13;

21.     Figure 1 highlights a sub-Regional cleavage between the countries&#13;
in the Region's northern tier and the others. Sudan (especially Southern&#13;
Sudan), Ethiopia, and Somalia form a cluster of countries with very low&#13;
enrollment and a very high degree of inequality represented by Gini''s in&#13;
excess of 0.363. The remaining countries except Burundi all have both&#13;
higher enrollment ratios and lower Gini coefficients. This clustering at&#13;
opposite ends of the curve calls for an attempt at explanation and an&#13;
appropriate policy response. Two speculative hypotheses emerge, both of&#13;
which are largely historical:&#13;
(a) Throughout most of Sub-Saharan Akfrica modern systems of educa-&#13;
tion were either initiated or given a major impetus by Christian missionary&#13;
societies. Except in the Equatoria province of the Southern Sudan, where&#13;
the RIs today are generally high, these agencies were not notably active in&#13;
the northern cluster countries;&#13;
(b) more recently, these countries have also seen the interruptive&#13;
effects of civil turmoil, war and revolution on their sustained long-term,&#13;
development efforts. Except possibly for UTganda, the other countri-es in&#13;
Figure 1 have been spared this latter factor.&#13;
22.     Among the twelve countries toward or at the lower end of the scale&#13;
in Figure 1, the relation between higher enrollment and less inequa:Lity&#13;
weakens somewhat. Tanzania, with an enrollment rate of somewhat less than&#13;
95% has achieved virtually the same 0.1 Gini coefficient as Lesotho with a&#13;
114% enrollment rate. Indeed, Kenya, Lesotho and Madagascar demonst:rate&#13;
an interesting propensity to curvilinearity in the relationship between&#13;
enrollment rate and Gini coefficient: once the 100% enrollment rate! is&#13;
surpassed, the Gini coefficient increases rather than decreases.    This is&#13;
perhaps due to th,e fact that some more wealt'hy districts permit stud'ents to&#13;
engage heavily in grade repetition to improve their promotion chances into&#13;
secondary education.&#13;
23.     The almost: perfect curvilinear relatlonship (r2 = 0.67) between&#13;
equity and participation rates adds an interesting predictive perspective&#13;
to the descriptive results of the study.   Knowing the quadratic function&#13;
w,hich fits the relationship,(9) and given a certain enrollment rate, the&#13;
degree of inequality (Gini) in the distribution of educational oppor-&#13;
tunities in a given country in Eastern AfricaI can be estimated.   Unfor-&#13;
tunately, by lack of empirical data, it remains an open question whether,&#13;
and if so at what point, the right side of the curve will again decrease.&#13;
9. Curvilinear regression analysis has found following equation to fi't the&#13;
scatter plot GINI = 0.6249 - 0.009255 PAR + 0.0000418 (PAR)2.    The R square&#13;
equals 0.667, and the standard deviation amounts to 0.087.&#13;

Urban-Rural Disparity&#13;
24.     It is a common assumption that urban areas, especially the capital&#13;
cities, enjoy unparallelled educational advantages over the more rural&#13;
districts in developing countries. The data in Table 2 taken from the&#13;
mixed sex matrix reveal that this is true only in slightly more than half&#13;
the cases under review here. Again the Region's four northern tier&#13;
countries (including Southern Sudan) constitute the more extreme-cases-of&#13;
urban privilege, as Table 2 shows, followed by Madagascar and Burundi.&#13;

one more dimension of their overall strong tendency toward unequal dis-&#13;

PAR = Participation (enrollment) rate&#13;
Equity and Apparient Attrition&#13;
26.     The study has not found a strong link between the degree of ineq-&#13;
uity in the allocation of educational opportunities and the slope of the&#13;
educational pyramid, as measured by the pyramid rate.    In this instance the&#13;
pyramid rate is used as a proxy measure of 1iystem efficiency.(10) Figure 2&#13;
shows that countries with relatively high GLni coefficients tend to have&#13;
lower pyramid rates and therefore apparently greater attrition between&#13;
grade rates (withl the notable exception of the Sudan), but countries with&#13;
relatively low Gini coefficients do not neceBssarily enjoy high pyramid&#13;
rates. In other words, the relationship between equity and system&#13;
efficiency, as measured by pyramid rates, is weak.&#13;
10. The pyramid rate is only one of the manv indicators of educational&#13;
efficiency. As noted previously, it is beliLeved to reflect the attrition&#13;
rate from one grade to the next in a school system. High pyramid rates&#13;
might also suggest unusually low and stable enrollment rates (e.g. Sudan).&#13;

Two Country Case Studies&#13;
27.     A further use of the study consists in making country-by-country&#13;
analyses of male-female, urban-rural, and inter-district disparities. One&#13;
example from the northern ties of states and another from the southern&#13;
countries have been chosen in order to contrast between the two groups of&#13;
countries.&#13;
28.     Sudan:  The formal system of primary education in the Sudan con-&#13;
sists of a 6-year cycle, for the 7-12 year age group. In 1977/78, enroll-&#13;
ment in Sudanese primary schools amounted to 1,015,300 pupils (about 60%&#13;
boys), which represented only 40.1% of the population between ages 7 and&#13;
12. Completion rates, as measured by the the pyramid rates, were close to&#13;
70%: 68.2% for male and 72.3% for female enrollments. The progression&#13;
rate from the primary schools to the secondary schools was about 13%.&#13;
29.     These figures represent a national average, behind which lie enor-&#13;
mous inter-provincial inequities. The inter-provincial Gini coefficient&#13;
for mixed enrollment amounted to 0.330, which was well above the Eastern&#13;
Africa average. The fact that the Gini coefficient was as high as: 0.401&#13;
for female enrollment, compared to 0.29 for male enrollment, alreaLdy&#13;
illustrates that regional inequities (reflecting social, economic and&#13;
social inequality) were accentuated within the female population.&#13;
30.     Participation rates reflected a range from almost 100% in the Nile&#13;
province, to an exceptionally low 7.4% in the remote (southern) Lakes&#13;
province (as Table 4 shows).&#13;

The participation rates for females were consistently lower, province by&#13;
province, than those for males. Their under-representation was accentuated&#13;
in the poorest areas of the country.&#13;
31.     The table of provincial RI's, Table 5, reinforces the picture of&#13;
the educational under-representation of the southern regions, particularly&#13;
among females (see also Annex Map).&#13;

32.     The regional differences in the distribution of educational oppor-&#13;
tunities are striking. For instance, the Ni].e province (in the North) had&#13;
a representation index of 2.43 (mixed sexes), whereas the same index for&#13;
the Lakes province (in the South) was as low as 0.190. The last two&#13;
columns in Table 5 compare for each district respectively the male and the&#13;
female school populations not with the total male and the total female age&#13;
groups in those districts, but with the global male and female population&#13;
in each district. The obtained "total" 36 - cell matrix, as it is called&#13;
to distinguish it from the other 18 - cell matrices, reveals important sex&#13;
disparities in the! distribution of primary school places. For example, a&#13;
simple comparison of the RI's in the separate male and female matrices for&#13;
the North Kordofan district, misleadingly suggests greater educational&#13;
deprivation among the males than among the females. In fact, all that&#13;
particular comparison shows is that in North'Kordofan the males were more&#13;
under-represented (RI = 0.53) among all Sudanese males than the females&#13;
were (RI = 0.61) among all Sudanese females.   When both the males and the&#13;
females in North Kordofan are compared to the global male and female&#13;
population in that district, it appears that ithe female&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
under-representation (RI = 0.47) was more severe than that of the males (RI&#13;
= 0.65).&#13;
33.     Inequity is also reflected in the differences in apparent&#13;
efficiency, as measured in proxy fashion by the pyramid rate. Table 6&#13;
displays the rank-ordered pyramid rates and pyramid indices for mixed&#13;
enrollment in Sudanese primary schools. The pyramid index compares the&#13;
pyramid ratios of each region with the national pyramid ratio, which serves&#13;
as a constant divisor.&#13;

five Northern provinces had pyramid indexes that were slightly lower than&#13;

34.     The "bump up" allocations of a 10% enrollment increase in the Sudan&#13;
(Table 7) are not surprisingly mainly directed towards the southern provin-&#13;
ces (and in those provinces towards the females).&#13;

E.ven with a 10% increase in enrollment (i.e., 101,526 school places) the&#13;
distribution of educational opportunities remains very inequitable in the&#13;
Sudan. The revised Gini following the bump up still amounts to 0.14.&#13;
35.     Lesotho:  Formal education in Lesothco consists of seven years of&#13;
primary education.   In 1977, total enrollments were about 226,300, equiv-&#13;
alent to about 133% of the female and 95% of,'the male population aged 6-12.&#13;
I'he national completion rate was low (32.2%),but was higher for females&#13;
(41%) than for males (22.4%). The progression rate from the primary to the&#13;
secondary schools was about 28%.&#13;
3,6.    Primary school enrollments are relatively equitably distributed&#13;
in Lesotho.  The national inter-regional Gini coefficient for mixed enroll-&#13;
ments amounted to 0.043 in 1977 (as compared to 0.330 for the Sudan). The&#13;
comparatively high total male and female Gini coefficient of 0.107, t:aking&#13;
aLlso into account imbalances based on sex, is a first indication that: in&#13;
Lesotho male-female disparities were more important than the inter-d:Lstrict&#13;
inequities.  Indeed, the Gini for total male enrollment amounted to 0.088,&#13;
whereas the Gini for total female enrollment amounted to a very low 0.021.&#13;

38.     The consistent under-representation of male students in Lesotho&#13;
appears even more clearly in Table 9, specifically in the comparison of&#13;
male and female RI's in the "total" matrix columns on the right. It&#13;
appears furthermore that the more densely populated lowlands (Butha-Buthe,&#13;
Leribe, Berea, and Maseru) were slightly over-represented in terms of&#13;
primary enrollments in the mixed column, whereas the more isolated Eastern&#13;
highlands were under-represented as far as primary school places were&#13;
concerned (see Annex Map).&#13;

39.     The regional differences in education,al efficiency in the Lesotho&#13;
school system, as measured by the pyramid rate and index, reinforces the&#13;
geographical pattern of inequity mentioned above. All the districts&#13;
located in the lowlands had pyramid indexes greater than unity, whereas in&#13;
the mountaneous East only Mafeteng had a slightly above average pyramid&#13;
ratio. However, perhaps more important than inter-district differences are&#13;
the low overall pyramid rates, as compared to those in Sudan.&#13;

40.     Perfect equity in the distribution of primary school enrollments&#13;
in Lesotho could be obtained at relatively little cost. If total enroll-&#13;
ment in Lesotho were to be increased selectively by 7.8% (17,650 school&#13;
place) the RI's of all districts would be lifted up at the RI level of&#13;
Berea (124% participation rate). This would require on investment of&#13;
approximately US$530,000. However, such an action hardly seems necessary&#13;
or justifiable since it would appear to mean over-provision, besides&#13;
limited additional expansion to the two or three districts with lowest&#13;
participation rates. For the other districts, the more appropriate measure&#13;
suggested by the usually low pyramid rates is to shift use of school places&#13;
from lower grades to the upper grades, perhaps by reducing repetition in&#13;
the former. The table below displaying mixed grade by grade participation&#13;
rates further confirms and illustrates in detail the over and under enroll-&#13;
ment in the lowest and highest grades, respectively in all districts.&#13;

A Possible Action Program&#13;
41.     The above discussion demonstrates that the traditional inequalities&#13;
which exist within many countries, male-fema:Le and urban-rural, are most&#13;
severe in the cluster of northern tier countries in which overall enroll-&#13;
ments are lowest. The country material in the annex and the two case&#13;
studies above also demonstrate the inequalities which exist between rural&#13;
districts especially in the northern countries.&#13;
42.     Assuming resources could be found, wlhere should an investment be&#13;
made to reduce most the inter-country and intra-country enrollment&#13;
inequalities? What would the cost implications of such an investment be?&#13;
In which countries, and in which areas of these same countries should&#13;
investments be made? To conduct this exercise ungraded enrollment and&#13;
estimated population data were also assembled for the Comoros and Mauritius&#13;
so that almost all Borrower countries in the Region could be included in a&#13;
brief global equity analysis.(l1) The basic data and indices for all the&#13;
countries are shown in Table 12. The Gini coefficient is 0.253. The&#13;
Lorenz curve is shown in Figure 3.&#13;

Zimbabwe.&#13;

The bump up exercise has been applied to the Eastern Africa Region as a&#13;
whole, with different hypothetical enrollment increments, ranging from a 1%&#13;
(182,506 enrollment places) to a 10% increment (1,825,064 enrollment&#13;
places). As displayed in Table 13, a 1% increment leads to an increase in&#13;
school places in three "countries" (Ethiopia, Southern Sudan, and Burundi),&#13;
whereas with a 10% increase in enrollment two additional countries (Sudan&#13;
and Somalia)(12) are allocated a share of the much larger enrollment&#13;
increase. Table 14 shows how the respective national enrollment quota&#13;
resulting from a modest 1.5% enrollment investment (273,758 places) should&#13;
be divided among the districts of the three countries concerned.&#13;
12. Of course, the Southern Sudan hereby gets counted twice: once by&#13;
itself, and a second time as part of the whole Sudan.&#13;

43.     Reducing the inequitites in the educational opportunities in East-&#13;
ern Africa has important financial implications. Taking an average&#13;
national primary education unit capital cost for the poorest districts in&#13;
the three countries, the total financial cost of the global 1.5% enrollment&#13;
increase amounts to US$30,597,00Q.(13) Table 15 displays the financial cost&#13;
for different enrollment increases for each country and for the Eastern&#13;
Africa Region as a whole.&#13;
13. Considering that the unit capital cost in the more remote districts of&#13;
a country are likely to be above the national average, this cost figure is&#13;
probably underestimated by as much as 15% to 25%.&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
44.     It is useful to compare the hypothetical allocation of new school&#13;
places as determined by this study, with the actual distribution of Bank&#13;
Group investments in primary education among Borrowers in the Region. The&#13;
alignment between the bump-up amounts targeted by the foregoing analysis&#13;
and the actual assistance to date is perhaps not as tight as could be&#13;
desired (Table 12).&#13;
45.     The foregoing discussion does indicate that if a deliberate&#13;
Regional attack on the lowest levels of primary enrollment in Eastern&#13;
Africa is to be mounted with the intention of making the biggest impact in&#13;
"bumping-up" countries, then such an attackd would aim at the priority&#13;
countries: Sudan, Ethiopia and Burundi. Table 16 would assist in the&#13;
further targeting of this assistance within those countries.    The study&#13;
does not promote equity as the only or even as a major goal in development.&#13;
It attempts to determine where school places should be created, if equity&#13;
is accepted as a major developmental goal.   It also suggests when, and when&#13;
not, equity should be raised as an issue, by giving a feel for what is&#13;
relative equality and what is extreme inequality in the distribution of&#13;
educational opportunities in the Eastern Ai-rica countries. At a time when&#13;
the promotion of equitable participation in development is going to have&#13;
to compete increasingly with other lending priorities, it would be&#13;
appropriate to iLnclude these findings and targets in the formulation of&#13;
an overall development program in the education sector.&#13;

            Distribution of primary school enrollments
            in Eastern Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper examines the distribution of
            primary school enrollments within and among the countries of
            the Eastern Africa Region. In a first phase, the study makes
            inter-country comparisons that indicate which countries and
            which areas in the Region lag in terms of educational
            opportunities. Thereafter, the focus of the paper shifts
            from the Region as a whole to the individual countries. Two
            basic questions are asked: (a) What is the overall degree of
            inequality in the distribution of a country?; and (b) which
            specific districts and urban vs. rural locations, or sex
            groups within these areas, fall below, or above, the
            national average in their enrollments and by how much? This
            question is answered by the use of representational indices,
            the Gini coefficient, participation rates and pyramid
            ratios. Lesotho and Sudan, representing the full range of
            relatively equal and unequal cases, are reviewed in more
            depth. Finally, the paper attempts to determine how and
            where to allocate educational investments in order to reduce
            both inter-country and intra-country inequities. The study
            draws exclusively on the large amounts of routing annual
            statistics gathered by countries and emphasizes the use of
            simple, computer generated indicators to reduce the data
            into readable form.
