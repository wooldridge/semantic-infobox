ABSTRACT&#13;
Despite the developing countries' impressive economic growth&#13;
of the past 25 years, the benefits have only reached the poor to a&#13;
very limited degree. The poorest countries have grown only slowly,&#13;
and within most (though not all) developing countries the growth&#13;
processes under way are such that the incomes of the poor increase&#13;
much more slowly than the average. Continuation of these trends is&#13;
a bleak and all too likely prospect, and although many policies have&#13;
been proposed to counter them, little has been done to estimate the&#13;
real possibilities for significantly reducing the poverty problem&#13;
within a reasonable period.&#13;
This paper uses a quantitative framework to project the numbers&#13;
of people in poverty under different assumptions about GNP growth,&#13;
population growth and changes in income distribution. Though it&#13;
makes no claim to model in detail the complex interactions between&#13;
development processes, national and international policies and&#13;
patterns of income distribution, the analysis helps to clarify&#13;
policy choices. Its conclusions demonstrate that the elimination&#13;
of absolute poverty by the end of this century is a highly unlikely&#13;
prospect; to achieve any substantial reduction would require com-&#13;
binations of policies designed to accelerate the growth of poor&#13;
countries, to distribute the benefits of growth more equitably, and&#13;
to slow the rapid pace of population increase in these countries.&#13;

Working Paper No. 309 issued in December 1978. Some of the data&#13;
in the earlier paper are now out of date, and it should be discarded.&#13;

GROWTH AND POVERTY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES*&#13;
Montek S. Ahluwalia, Nicholas G. Carter and Hollis B. Chenery&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Although the output of the world economy has expanded&#13;
at an unprecedented rate in the past quarter century, the&#13;
benefits of growth have only reached the world's poor to a very&#13;
limited degree. This is not due to any failure of developing&#13;
countries as a group to share in the general economic expansion.&#13;
Their income per capita rose by almost 3 percent per year over&#13;
this period--considerably faster than in the past. The failure&#13;
lies in the distributional pattern of past growth, which has&#13;
left the poorest groups largely outside the sphere of economic&#13;
expansion and material improvements.&#13;
There are two aspects to this phenomenon. First, the&#13;
impressive growth record of the Third World as a whole conceals&#13;
the fact that most of the poorest countries, containing the major&#13;
concentrations of the world's poor, have experienced lesser&#13;
increases.    Second, and equally important, there is mounting&#13;
evidence that the growth processes under way in most developing&#13;
countries are such that incomes of the poorer groups increase&#13;
more slowly than the average.&#13;
International debate has centered around the design&#13;
of policies to offset these trends. Proponents of a New Inter-&#13;
national Economic Order consider the major objective to be the&#13;
* This paper attempts to synthesize and extend the comparative&#13;
studies of growth and distribution in developing countries by&#13;
Chenery and Carter (1973, 1977), Ahluwalia and Chenery (1974),&#13;
and Ahluwalia (1976). Statistical support was provided by Hazel&#13;
Elkington and Tamar Katz. We are indebted to Bela Balassa,&#13;

acceleration of growth in developing countries, with special con-&#13;
cessions to the poorest among them. Others give greater weight to&#13;
policies to improve the internal distribution of income, including&#13;
direct measures to satisfy the basic needs of the poorest groups.&#13;
These issues have been discussed so far in largely qualitative terms&#13;
with little attempt to translate global targets for the eradication&#13;
of poverty into more specific strategies whose feasibility can be&#13;
examined.&#13;
The present paper suggests a quantitative framework for&#13;
such an analysis and derives some preliminary conclusions&#13;
from it.      Although there is not yet an adequate statistical&#13;
basis for a formal analysis of the key relationships involved, there&#13;
has been considerable progress in the past few years in several&#13;
areas: (a) the definition and measurement of the incidence of poverty,&#13;
using both physical and monetary indices; (b) securing internationally&#13;
comparable data on income levels, based on purchasing power compari-&#13;
sons; (c) measurement of the distribution of income and consumption&#13;
within developing countries.&#13;
Our study is in three parts: (I) estimation of the&#13;
extent of absolute poverty in developing countries and of the&#13;
relationship between income distribution and rising levels of output;&#13;
(II) analysis of past trends in growth and poverty in a representa-&#13;
tive group of countries and of the implications of projecting these&#13;
trends on the basis of present policies; (III) a consideration of&#13;
possible improvements on this performance through accelerating income&#13;
growth, improving its distribution and reducing fertility. The study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3-&#13;
concludes with a comparison of alternatiye approaches to poverty reduc-&#13;
tion and their implications for nationnal and intrrnit,:nnAl acetrnr.&#13;
Despite the tentative nature of some of the underlying assump-&#13;
tions, it demonstrates that a combination of several approaches&#13;
and of national and international action is more likely to succeed&#13;
in reducing poverty than exclusive reliance on any one of them.&#13;
I. THE DIMENSIONS OF GLOBAL POVERTY&#13;
This section attempts to evaluate the scale of poverty&#13;
in the developing world and the available evidence on the impact&#13;
of growth on poverty. The analysis is based on a sample of 36&#13;
countries which are listed below in Table 1. The sample is&#13;
broadly representative of developing countries with mixed or&#13;
market-oriented economies. They span the wide range of income&#13;
levels observed in the developing world and reflect its distri-&#13;
bution by broad geographic regions. Together, the countries in&#13;
our sample account for about 80 percent of the population of the&#13;
developingworld excluding China.&#13;
1/ The principal limitation on the size of the sample is the&#13;
availability of data on income distribution. Indeed, of the&#13;
36 countries in our sample, fairly reliable distribution data were&#13;
available only for 25. For the remainder we have used&#13;
estimates of the distribution of income based upon cross&#13;
country comparisons (see Appendix Table 1). We have resorted&#13;
to this procedure only in cases where inclusion of the&#13;
country was very desirable either because of its size or to&#13;
ensure adequate geographical representation.&#13;

Defining Absolute Poverty&#13;
The first step in measuring the scale of poverty is to&#13;
establish a common poverty line to be applied across countries.&#13;
It is self-evident that such a definition is necessarily arbi-&#13;
trary. Attempts to define absolute poverty in terms of some&#13;
objectively determinable minimum level of consumption that is&#13;
necessary for "continued survival" do not escape this problem,&#13;
since the notion of corf-inued survival is undefined. At the very&#13;
least we would need to specify survival through some given&#13;
life expectancy in a given environment. Present levels of life&#13;
expectancy in most developing countries are quite low and do not&#13;
provide a basis for defining minimum requirements. Increases&#13;
in life expectancy will require higher levels of real consumption&#13;
including not only better food intake, but also a better general&#13;
environment for health and nutrition.&#13;
Not only is the notion of a biologically determined&#13;
absolute poverty level imprecise, it is in any case wrong to think that&#13;
poverty should be defined solely in terms of biological requireTnents.&#13;
Ultimately, concepts such as poverty lines are operationally&#13;
meaningful only when they acquire some social reality, i.e., when&#13;
there exists a sufficient social concensus that a particular level&#13;
of living represents an objective which claims a high social&#13;
priority. Once we recognize that acceptability by contemporary&#13;
social standards is a key requirement, it follows that poverty&#13;
lines used in national policy debates will vary across countries,&#13;
reflecting differences in levels of economic, social and political&#13;
development. By the same token, they will also change over time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
For these reasons any effort to define a poverty line&#13;
to be applied across countries and over time must be approached with&#13;
caution. We have concluded, however, that with all its limitations&#13;
it can provide a useful basis for international policy. For this&#13;
purpose, it is less important that the poverty line correspond&#13;
to some objective criteria for minimal levels than that the absolute&#13;
level chosen be conservative and rouqhly comparable across countries.&#13;
In this paper we have based our definition on the poverty lines&#13;
which have been used in India, which is the largest and one of&#13;
the best studied developing countries.&#13;
There is an extensive literature on the measurement of&#13;
poverty in India and a variety of poverty lines have been proposed,&#13;
some of which have received official sanction. The most widely&#13;
used poverty line is defined in terms of the total consumption&#13;
expenditure needed to ensure a daily supply of 25u calories&#13;
per person, given the observed expenditure patterns of the Indian&#13;
1/&#13;
population.     Estimates of the extent of poverty in terms of&#13;
this standard vary from year to year, but most estimates range&#13;
between 40 and 50 percent of the total population. For our study&#13;
we have adopted an intermediate position, setting the poverty&#13;
level to be applied across countries as the income per head&#13;
accruing to the 45th percentile (approximately) of the Indian&#13;
population. Application of this essentially South Asian standard&#13;
1/ It should be emphasized that poverty lines defined in terms&#13;
of consumption expenditure ignore the fact that there is&#13;
very considerable variation in calorie intake achieved at any&#13;
given level of expend:iture. In any case, the underlying&#13;
specification of a single caloric norm is itself questionable.&#13;
Nutritionists have shown that there is very considerable&#13;
variation in caloric requirements even for the same individual&#13;
over time.&#13;

across all developing countries yields estimates of poverty that are&#13;
conservative in the sense of understating the extent of the problem by&#13;
standards appropriate for richer countries.&#13;
Having chosen a poverty line, the next step is to apply it in&#13;
such a way to ensure comparability across countries. The use of official&#13;
exchange rates to define equivalent levels of expenditure in different&#13;
countries does not ensure equivalent levels of real purchasing power.&#13;
We have attempted to overcome this problem by using "equivalent pur-&#13;
chasing power conversion ratios" estimated by Kravis and associates&#13;
from data collected by the United Nations International Comparison&#13;
Project (ICP).!/ Using these ratios, we can convert the per capita GNP&#13;
levels in each country into GNP per capita measured in dollars of 1970&#13;
U.S. prices--hereafter called ICP dollars. The resulting estimates are&#13;
shown in Table 1. Our poverty line is easily calculated given the&#13;
income distribution for India for 1975 and its estimated level of per&#13;
capita GNP in ICP dollars. We have chosen a poverty line of 200 ICP&#13;
dollars--the level of the 46th percentile--which is then applied to the&#13;
income distribution and per capita GNP data for other councries to&#13;
estimate the extent of poverty in each case.-/&#13;
1/ The International Comparison Project has been a joint responsibility&#13;
of the United Nations Statistical Office, the World Bank, and the&#13;
International Comparison Unit of the University of Pennsylvania. Two&#13;
volumes of results have been published; see Kravis, Kenessey, Heston,&#13;
and Summers (1975), which includes detailed estimates for India, and&#13;
Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1978a). The conversion factors used&#13;
here were estimated by Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1978b). These&#13;
ratios are called "Kravis factors'! in this paper; the resulting unit&#13;
of value is identified as an ICP dollar. Other methods of estimating&#13;
conversion factors from the ICP data are under study.&#13;
2/ Although the Indian estimates of poverty are based on a consumption&#13;
standard applied to the distribution of population across consumption&#13;
levels, in our study we have defined the poverty line by the income&#13;
per head observed at the 46th percentile of the Indian population.&#13;
The use of per capita GNP instead of per capita personal income&#13;
(which is clearly more appropriate) is dictated by the absence of&#13;
data on the personal income component of GNP. Since the proportion&#13;
of personal income in GNP declines at higher levels of develoDment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This income-based approach to defining poverty makes&#13;
no explicit allowance for the achievement of minimum levels for&#13;
essential public services such as health, education, access to&#13;
clean water and sanitation. These are key elements in a more&#13;
complete definition of poverty that are of crucial importance&#13;
in designing a balanced program of poverty alleviation, but they&#13;
remain outside the present analysis.&#13;
The Extent of Poverty in Developing Countries&#13;
The procedure just described enables us to estimate the&#13;
extent of poverty in each country using an income level that&#13;
reflects comparable levels of purchasing power. These estimates&#13;
are reported in the fourth column of Table 1. For purposes of&#13;
comparison, we have also estimated the extent of poverty in our&#13;
sample without the conversion ratios. In this case, we measure&#13;
per capita GNP for each country in US dollars by converting at&#13;
official exchange rates, calculate the income level of the 46th&#13;
percentile in India and apply this level to the data for all other&#13;
countries. These estimates are shown in the last column of&#13;
Table 1. Since in each case the poverty line is based on the&#13;
income of the same percentile of the Indian population, the&#13;
difference between the two estimates lies in the extent to which&#13;
poverty in other countries is altered relative to India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
In general, we find that the use of purchasing power ratios&#13;
reduces the differences between the incidence of poverty in middle&#13;
and higher income countries compared to the low income countries.&#13;
The use of ICP dollars also raises the estimates of&#13;
poverty relative to India in the low income countries. This&#13;
rise reflects the fact that the Kravis purchasing power ratios&#13;
suggest that GNP levels in both groups of countries are overstated&#13;
1/&#13;
relative to India.&#13;
The major features of global poverty as revealed in the&#13;
estimates based on purchasing power ratios correspond broadly to&#13;
2/&#13;
other estimates.   Almost forty percent of the population of the&#13;
developing countries live in absolute poverty defined in terms of&#13;
1/ While the use of the Kravis conversion ratios is clearly a&#13;
step in the right direction, it also raises questions that&#13;
we have not addressed. For example, it is likely that the&#13;
purchasing power ratios vary for different income groups&#13;
within a country. Since an important element underlying this&#13;
correction is the relative undervaluation of services in&#13;
low income countries, and since services are disproportionately&#13;
consumed by the rich, it may be the case that official exchange&#13;
rates understate incomes of the rich more than of the poor.&#13;
By applying a single average correction factor to GNP per&#13;
capita we ignore this problem. A similar argument can be made&#13;
for distinguishing between conversion rates relevant for&#13;
different regions or for urban and rural areas.&#13;

income levels that are insufficient to provide adequate nutri-&#13;
tion by South Asian standards. The bulk of the poor are in the&#13;
poorest countries: in South Asia, Indonesia, and Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa. These countries account for two-thirds of the total&#13;
population and well over three-fourths of the population in&#13;
poverty. The incidence of poverty is 60 percent or more in&#13;
countries having the lowest levels of real GNP.&#13;
While the incidence 'of poverty is much lower for the&#13;
middle income developing countries in our sample, our estimates&#13;
of poverty in this group of countries increases from 24 to 31&#13;
percent when purchasing power ratios are used to estimate GNP. There&#13;
is a similar increase in the high income group from 8 to 13 percent.&#13;
It is interesting to compare our estimates of absolute&#13;
poverty to those reported for selected Latin American countries&#13;
in a recent joint study by the Economic Commission for Latin&#13;
1/&#13;
America and the World Bank.    This study estimates a much higher&#13;
incidence of poverty in Latin America--around 40 percent for the&#13;

region as a whole--but this results from the adoption of poverty&#13;
lines which are significantly higher than those derived from South&#13;
Asia. For example, the food budget was geared to a higher minimum&#13;
nutritional level and was constrained to ensure some mimimum&#13;
consumption of higher value foods (meat, fruit, eggs and milk).&#13;
The food budget thus obtained was used to define two different&#13;
poverty lines: a "destitution line", defined as income equal to&#13;
the food budget, and a "poverty line", defined as income equal to&#13;
twice the food budget to allow for nonfood expenditures. Estimates&#13;
of the extent of poverty in the Latin American countries in our&#13;
sample are broadly in line with Altimir's estimates of the&#13;
extent of destitution (about 19 percent of the population of&#13;
Latin America). Furthermore, projections using either method&#13;
show little prospective decline in absolute poverty with present&#13;
trends.&#13;
1/ The calorie requirement used is also higher--ranging between&#13;
2260 and 2350 calories per person per day--and there is also&#13;
a specified minimum protein requirement varying between 40&#13;
to 43 grams per person. Furthermore, the food budgets were&#13;
calculated so as to provide explicit allowance for a minimum&#13;
consumption of vegetables and fruit to provide minerals and&#13;
vitamins in a balanced diet.&#13;

Poverty and Growth: A Review of Evidence&#13;
The extent of poverty in any country depends upon two&#13;
factors--the average level of income and the degree of inequality in i&#13;
distribution. Although the estimates of income growth axe relatively&#13;
good, we have little reliable information on how the distribution&#13;
of income has changed over time. Systematic time series data&#13;
based on reliable sources and using comparable concepts are simply&#13;
not available. At most there is a handful of countries for which&#13;
we have observations for two or more years spanning a decade or so.&#13;
In the absence of time series data for individual&#13;
countries any assessment of changes in the distribution of income&#13;
accompanying development in the past must be based upon what can&#13;
be inferred from cross country data. This evidence has been&#13;
extensively studied in recent years and a brief summary of the&#13;
findings is presented below.&#13;
The central theme in the continuing debate on trends&#13;
in income distribution is whether development in the past has&#13;
been accompanied by such an increase in inequality that the poor&#13;
have benefitted relatively little from overall growth. Much of&#13;
this debate has its origin in the classical contributions of&#13;
Kuznets (1955, 1963), who hypothesized that the process ot&#13;
development was likely to be accompanied by a substantial increase&#13;
in inequality, which would reverse itself only at a relatively&#13;
advanced stage. Kuznets' original speculation was based on&#13;
fragmentary historical data for the now developed countries, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
in its later development, especially at the hands of subsequent&#13;
contributors, the investigation of this hypothesis has relied&#13;
almost entirely upon cross country evidence. A number of studies--&#13;
Adelman and Morris (1973), Paukert (1973), Chenery and Syrquin&#13;
(1975) and Ahluwalia (1976)--using different, and progressively&#13;
more reliable sets of cross country data, have reported&#13;
1/&#13;
confirmation of the hypothesis to some degree.    The average&#13;
pattern discerned in the data is one of significant increase in&#13;
inequality as income levels rise from the least develc&#13;
what is currently described as middle income (ahoutf tJqSlnnO&#13;
2/&#13;
per capita in 1975 prices)7&#13;
The extent ot the increase in relative ineauality-&#13;
reported by difEerent authors varies substantially. At one&#13;
extreme, Adelman and Morris (1973) have argued that the,crosi&#13;
country data suggest that economic growth will be accompaniedl&#13;
by a process of prolonqed absolute impoverishmnent fl)t lar(3e&#13;
sections of thie Ljopulatioii. Others, such as Ahliiw.tl ia (]976),&#13;
have argued thaL whiile the crosscountry evidence lXoiiits to&#13;
increasing inequality in the early stages, this does not&#13;
completely offset the effect of qrowth. Tnconie levels otf Lht&#13;
poorer quintiles are likely to rise ,but much wsore slowly thaii&#13;
the average.&#13;
1/  It must be emiphasized that given the limitatioiis of cros,i&#13;
country data, this evidence is at best persuasive. For a&#13;
skeptical view see Papanek (1978).&#13;
2/ For the typical developing country, $1000 in 1975 prices and&#13;
at official exchanqek rates is equal to $1660 ICP dollars&#13;
at 1970 prices, the unit used here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
The limited time series evidence provides some support&#13;
for Ahluwalia's conclusion. There are a number of countries for&#13;
which we have estimates of the distribution of income at two&#13;
points in time spanning about ten years in each case. The&#13;
majority of these countries appear to show some decline in the&#13;
income shares of the poorer quintiles over time, but in no case&#13;
is this decline in income shares sufficiently steep to offset&#13;
1/&#13;
the recorded growth in mean incomes.&#13;
A simplified representation of the Kuznets' effect&#13;
is given in Figure 1, which plots the per capita income of the top 40&#13;
percent of the population against that of the bottom 60 percent. Lines&#13;
of constant per capita income appear as downward sloping straiqht linEs&#13;
Ahluwalia's estimate of the Kuznets' curve in these dimensions&#13;
appears as a curve with maximum inequality in the vicinity of&#13;
800 ICP dollars (1970 prices). Between the income levels of&#13;
200 and 800 dollars the share of the lower 60 per cent declines&#13;
from 32 per cent to 23 per cent of the national income. A country&#13;
1/  It should be noted that here we are referring to changes&#13;
over time for the economy as a whole. This does not rule&#13;
out the possibility of increased impoverishment in a part&#13;
of the economy, e.g., the rural areas in general, or a&#13;
particularly depressed region. See, for example, Griffin and Khan&#13;
(1978) for an exposition of the view that growth has been&#13;
accompanied by increasing rural poverty.&#13;

that followed this average relation would have about 80 per&#13;
cent of the increment accruing to the upper 40 per cent and&#13;
1/&#13;
quite modest increases for the remaining groups.&#13;
This average relationship can be compared with the&#13;
observed movement of individual countries over specified periods&#13;
of time, as shown by the arrows in Figure 1. These observations&#13;
relate to a relatively short time period--typically 10 years--&#13;
and the data are often not strictly comparable for a given country.&#13;
Nevertheless, the broad picture of intertemporal movements is&#13;
generally consistent with the average cross country path indicated&#13;
by the heavy curve. The underlying observations for each country&#13;
do not show any case of a decline in the per capita income of&#13;
the lowest quintile.&#13;
It is important to emphasize that the average cross&#13;
country relationship should not be interpreted as an iron law.&#13;
Individual countries that are able to establish the preconditions&#13;
for a more egalitarian distribution of income and to stimulate&#13;
growth in such a policy environment, as illustrated by Yugoslavia,&#13;
Taiwan and Korea, may well be able to avoid or moderate the&#13;
phase of increasing inequality. But there are a number of&#13;
reasons why such a pattern is likely to emerge with a&#13;
continuation of past policies, especially in the non-socialist&#13;
countries characterized by sharp inequalities in the initial&#13;
1/ Ahluwalia's (1976) estimates-from which these aggregate&#13;
measures are derived were made for quintiles, which show&#13;
that most of the change in shares is concentrated in the&#13;
upper 20 per cent and lower 40 per cent of the population.&#13;
Further details are given in the technical appendix.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

distribution of productive wealth (including land). For one&#13;
thing, development typically involves a shift of population&#13;
from the low income, slower growing agricultural sector to the&#13;
high income, faster growing modern sector. This process, which&#13;
is central to the dual economy theories of Lewis (1954) and Fei&#13;
and Ranis (1964), can be shown to generate a phase of widening&#13;
1/&#13;
inequality.    This is especially true when the growth of the&#13;
modern sector takes an increasingly capital intensive form, as&#13;
in Mexico and Brazil, with incomes per person employed rising&#13;
relatively rapidly but with a limited increase in employment.&#13;
It is less true of the more labor intensive form, illustrated&#13;
by Taiwan and Korea, which is characterized by high rates of&#13;
absorption of labor and a more rapid approach to full employment.&#13;
Policy clearly has an important role in determining which form&#13;
predominates.&#13;
- There are several other factors that contribute to&#13;
widening inequality. Economic growth is likely to produce a&#13;
more rapid rise in the demand for skilled labor compared to&#13;
unskilled labor, leading to widening inequality in the early&#13;
stages, when the supply of skilled labor expands relatively&#13;
slowly. These disequalizing factors are often exacerbated by&#13;
an institutional and policy framework that is biased in favor&#13;
or the modern, urban sectors of the economy, leading to an&#13;
excessive flow of resources to these sectors, and increasing&#13;
the incentives for capital intensive production.&#13;
1/ See Robinson (1976) and Ahluwalia (1976). Bell (1979)&#13;
gives a more formal demonstration of the possibility of U&#13;
shaped curves relating to the wage share in simple dual&#13;
economy models.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Combining the available evidence with these a priori con-&#13;
siderations, we conclude that the most likely outcome associated&#13;
with economic growth in poor countries is some increase in inequal-&#13;
ity. The projections discussed below adopt this assumption in the&#13;
Base Case but depart from it in considering the effects of&#13;
improved distributional policies.&#13;
The use of the Kuznets curve in projections also implies&#13;
that the distribution of income will improve in countries with a&#13;
per capita income above 800 ICP dollars without specifying the effort&#13;
required to redirect government policies. Needless to say, we&#13;
cannot assume that this improvement will take place automatically.&#13;
The low inequality observed in the developed countries today is&#13;
as much the result of institutional evolution resulting from&#13;
particular historical and political factors as of their level of&#13;
development. It has been argued by Bacha (1977) that the observed&#13;
reduction in inequality in the developed countries over the first&#13;
half of this century arose from social and political changes&#13;
following the first world war that are not likely to be replicated&#13;
in countries approaching industrial maturity today./ In any case,&#13;
we note that while our projections may be overoptimistic about&#13;
future developments in countries approaching industrial maturity,&#13;
this assumption does not affect our projections of global poverty.&#13;
1/ The most important of these developments was the strengthening&#13;
of organized labor following the first world war and its sub-&#13;
sequent political role in developing a welfare state. Hlowever,&#13;
this argument should not be overstated, since these institu-&#13;
tional changes were themselves based on an underlying economic&#13;
transformation in the role of labor arising from the phenomenon&#13;
of labor scarcity and the greater role of human skills in the&#13;
production process. Similar processes can be expected to occur&#13;
in the future, although in different social and political&#13;
contexts, and they are likely to strengthen tendencies towards&#13;
greater equality, although perhaps not so soon as predicted&#13;
by the cross-country estimates.&#13;

II. CONSEQUENCES OF EXISTING POLICIES&#13;
Our analysis focusses upon three aspects of development&#13;
in each country in our sample: (a) the growth of aggregate income;&#13;
(b) the growth of population; and (c) changes in the distribution of&#13;
income by deciles. These measures can be combined to analyze the&#13;
evolution of relative and absolute poverty over time for individual&#13;
countries or groups of countries.&#13;
The Base Projection&#13;
The conceptual basis for our analysis is a disaggregation&#13;
of income growth in each country into a separate growth pattern for&#13;
each income class (decile), expressed in ICP dollars of constant&#13;
purchasing power. When applied to our sample of 36 countries, this&#13;
procedure yields a time series of per capita income for 360 popula-&#13;
tion units. These can be aggregated to determine the numbers of&#13;
people below a given poverty line in groups of countries as well as&#13;
measures of relative inequality within groups. This procedure will&#13;
be applied both in analyzing past trends in individual countries and&#13;
in determining the distributional consequences of projected growth.&#13;
Despite the variable quality of the data on income distri-&#13;
bution, it is useful to retain individual countries as units of obser-&#13;
vation, both because of the substantial difference in their initial&#13;
conditions and the necessity of defining the scope for policy changes&#13;
on a country basis. The analysis focusses on the results for groups&#13;
of countries, since aggregation reduces the effects of errors in&#13;
country data.&#13;
The procedure indicated above is carried out in four steps:&#13;
(a) estimation of the income level of each country&#13;
(Y~) for the past (1960-1975) and projection of&#13;
i&#13;
this level for the future.(1975-2000);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(b) estimation of population (Nt) by country for&#13;
the same periods;&#13;
(c) estimation of income shares by deciles (Dtj)&#13;
for each country and hence the level of income&#13;
for each decile group;&#13;
(d)  determination of the number of people (N) below&#13;
the absolute poverty line in each year.&#13;
The results of step (c) can be used to compute&#13;
measures of inequality for any country or group of countries.&#13;
Growth in Income and Population. The present study&#13;
was designed to determine the distributional consequences of&#13;
exÂ±Lsing country projections of GNP and population. These have&#13;
been made by the World Bank in the context of a global analysis&#13;
of international trade and capital flows. They provide a point&#13;
of departure (Base Case). from which to consider changes in&#13;
internal and external policies. The Base Case incorporates&#13;
changes in GNP growth expected to occur with some improvement&#13;
in existing policies as well as changes in population growth&#13;
that can be anticipated from existing demographic trends.&#13;
Table 2 gives the growth in population and GNP determined on&#13;
1/&#13;
thi- basis for the period 1975-2000.&#13;
Since our main concern is with,the incidence of poverty,&#13;
the assumptions made for the poorer countries are more important&#13;
than those for the rest of the panel. In the past the economies&#13;
of the poorer countries have grown more slowly because of the&#13;
greater weight of the agricultural sector (whose growth is limited&#13;
1/ The growth rates are based on projections to 1985 or 1990&#13;
that underlie recent World Bank studies of the world&#13;
economy (1977, 1979). They lie between the Base Case projec-&#13;
tion for 1980 to 1990 of the latter (5.6%) and the more&#13;
ootimistic Droiection (6.6%).&#13;

by both demand and technology), lower rates of savings, and&#13;
other structural factors. In addition, the international&#13;
environment has been somewhat less favorable to the growth of&#13;
poor countries and domestic policy failures have probably&#13;
1./&#13;
been more pronounced.&#13;
For the future some acceleration of growth is&#13;
anticipated in several of the largest poor countries--India,&#13;
Indonesia and Bangladesh--so that the average of the group is&#13;
expected to increase from 3.7% to 5.0%. This will be partially&#13;
offset by an increase in population growth as death rates fall&#13;
more rapidly than birth rates. Although only a limited&#13;
acceleration of aggregate growth is projected for the other&#13;
developing countries, this will be augmented by a fall in&#13;
population growth as they move further into the demographic&#13;
transition.&#13;
Changes in Distribution. The specification of plausible&#13;
changes in distribution raises two main issues. If existing&#13;
policies continue, what changes in distribution can be expected&#13;
as a result of the growth processes now under way? Conversely,&#13;
if a government takes stronger measures to improve income&#13;
distribution, what is likely to happen to growth? Although&#13;
1/ The relation between growth and i'ncome level is analyzed by&#13;
Robinson (1971) and Chenery, Elkington and Sims (1970).&#13;
Chenery and Carter (1973) give an evaluation of the effects&#13;
of internal and external factors on past growth for a sample&#13;
of countries similar to the present one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
there is no eonsensus among economists on either of these&#13;
questions, we will make the following assumptions for the&#13;
present analysis.&#13;
In the first place, since time series data will not&#13;
support a separate analysis of each country, we initially&#13;
assume average behavior for countries having a given initial&#13;
income level and distribution. More specifically, we assume&#13;
that the cross-section estimates of the Kuznets relation discussed&#13;
above are representative of the behavior of mixed economies over&#13;
time in the absence of effective government action to alter them.&#13;
This leads to a worsening of income distribution for countries&#13;
below a per capita income of 800 ICP dollars. We&#13;
also assume that there is a tendency for the income distribution&#13;
to improve above this level, although the historical causes of&#13;
this improvement have been as much political as economic.&#13;
To translate these assumptions into a projection procedure,&#13;
we construct a separate Kuznets' curve for each country by means&#13;
of which the distribution estimated for 1975 (or any other year)&#13;
1/&#13;
can be projected to higher or lower levels of income.      The&#13;
country-specific curves differ in their starting points but&#13;
have the same curvature. The effect for representative countries&#13;
above or below the average distribution is shown by the solid&#13;
lines in Figure 2. The Base Case projection for a country such&#13;
1/ The formula for this function assumes that the two parameters&#13;
in the quadratic furLction describing the Kuznets curve apply&#13;
to each country, as indicated in the Appendix.&#13;

as India, which is close to the average to start with, would follow&#13;
the Kuznets curve quite closely. Other countries, such as Brazil&#13;
or Korea, retain their relative positions above or below the&#13;
average distribution and in this sense are assumed to run "parallel"&#13;
to the Kuznets curve. Although this is a highly stylized&#13;
interpretation of the existing evidence, it is more plausible&#13;
than assuming that there is no effect of economic development and indus-&#13;
trialization on distribution, which is the only obvious alternative.&#13;
The question of the effect of changing distribution on&#13;
growth arises later when we take up alternative distributional&#13;
policies. We then assume that there is a reduction in growth&#13;
proportional to the fall in the share of income (and savings) of&#13;
the upper income group. The effects of this assumption are&#13;
illustrated by the second set of projections in Figure 2, which&#13;
are discussed below.&#13;
By way of summary, the relations among the several deter-&#13;
minants of poverty are shown schematically in Figure 3. The links&#13;
between internal and external policies and the extent of poverty&#13;
in each country are traced through three intermediate variables:&#13;
population (N), per capita GDP (y), and income distribution (D).&#13;
Projections of population growth and GDP are taken from other&#13;
studies and become exogenous variables in the Base Case. The&#13;
1/ The actual projections are made for each decile and are&#13;
aggregated here to illustrate the overall effects.&#13;
2/ We have, however, made calculations based on the latter assump-&#13;
tion in order to show the net effect of the Kuznets hypothesis.&#13;

distribution of income by decile (D ij) is generated as a function of&#13;
the initial distribution and the average variation with per capita&#13;
income.&#13;
In the Base Case simulation there is no feedback from the&#13;
distribution of income to the rate of growth. However, in simulations&#13;
where we depart from the distributional behavior of the Base Case we&#13;
allow for a feedback from income distribution to GDP growth. Other&#13;
possible feedbacks, such as those from GDP and its distribution&#13;
to population growth, are not analyzed explicitly and are indi-&#13;
cated by dotted lines. (A mathematical statement of the simulation&#13;
model is given in the Appendix.)&#13;
Trends in Inequality and Poverty&#13;
The basic projections are given in Table 3 for the&#13;
three country groups and for the poorest 40 percent of the people&#13;
in each group. The trends for the period 1960-1975 are simulated&#13;
in the same way for purposes of comparision. These results&#13;
bring out the main links between overall growth and the changes&#13;
in inequality and absolute poverty.&#13;
Inequality. The sources of growing inequality in the&#13;
developing world as a whole can be summarized by means of the&#13;
Theil index, which permits a decomposition of inequality into two&#13;
1/&#13;
elements:  within and among countries.     This index and the&#13;
proportion due to inequality among countries are shown below for&#13;
/ The Theil index is defined as Eyiln (Y_)&#13;
where y. and n. are the shares of in oAe and population of a given&#13;
decile 6nit in the total income or population of the group of&#13;
countries.  This index varies between 0 in the case wh re all&#13;
income shares are equal to population shares, and log -,. where nj&#13;
is the population share of the smallest group.   Note   nI&#13;
that inequality is at a maximum when all income accrues to the&#13;
smallest possible group.&#13;

There is a substantial increase in overall inequality and&#13;
in the proportion due to variation among countries. This&#13;
increase in inequality can be examined in terms of the inter-&#13;
action of two factors: (a) the intercountry lag between the&#13;
countries of Group A and all developing countries; (b) the&#13;
within-group lag in the growth of the poor within these&#13;
countries in relation to the average. Thus, the growth of&#13;
income of the poorest 40 percent in Group A countries (who&#13;
account for about 80 percent of the world's poor in our Base&#13;
year) can be written as:&#13;
(GaaG((1)&#13;

Ga)&#13;
where Gpa is the growth of income of the poorest 40 percent in&#13;
Group A, Ga is the growth of Group A, G is the growth of all&#13;
developing countries and npa measures the total lag in the form of&#13;
an income elasticity, Table 3 gives the following measures for&#13;
these ratios for Groups A and B.&#13;

In the past the lag in the growth of poor countries (na)&#13;
was a more important factor than the lag in growth of the poor&#13;
1/&#13;
within these countries   (np).    For the future, we project higher&#13;
growth rates for several of the poor countries--notably India&#13;
and Bangladesh--that will raise the intergroup ratio from .46&#13;
to .65. The worsening of internal distribution will be accentuated&#13;
by more rapid growth, however, so that the two factors become of&#13;
roughly equal importance in explaining the projected lag in the&#13;
income growth of the poor (.45). For the middle income group,&#13;
on the other hand, both lags are projected to increase. As a&#13;
1/ If the two factors were measured for individual countries&#13;
rather than for Group A as a whole, the difference would be&#13;
even greater.&#13;

result no improvement in the total elasticity (.55) is projected&#13;
for developing countries as a group with existing policies.&#13;
Poverty. The lag in the growth of income of the poorest&#13;
40 percent in low income countries is obviously at the core of&#13;
the problem of world poverty. Trends in absolute poverty are shown&#13;
in the last two sections of Table 3 and in Figure 5 below. In&#13;
1975 the numbers of the poor were still increasing in almost all of&#13;
the countries in Group A but had started to decline in most&#13;
countries in Groups B and C. For the future a continued rise is&#13;
projected in a number of the poor countries, but it is offset by&#13;
a reversal of this trend in Indonesia, India and Pakistan. The&#13;
net effect is a decline in absolute poverty of around 10 percent&#13;
in the low and middle groups and considerably more in Group C.&#13;
In overall terms the number of absolute poor in all devel-&#13;
oping countries (except for the centrally planned economies) would&#13;
be on the order of 600 million people in the year 2000 when&#13;
allowance is made for countries omitted from our sample. This figure&#13;
defines the magnitude of the problem to be addressed in devising&#13;
policies that will lead to a more rapid reduction in poverty.&#13;
Although in relative terms these projections represent impressive&#13;
progress in reducing poverty--from about 50 percent of the popula-&#13;
tion of developing countries in 1960 to 16 percent in 2000--they&#13;
fall considerably short of the results that might be achieved with&#13;
snore effective policies.&#13;
1/ The less optimistic projection in Table 3, based on historical&#13;
trends in each country, shows only a modest reduction in&#13;
poverty in 2000 to the level existing in 1960.&#13;

Variation in Country Experience&#13;
Although we have usable time series data for only twelve&#13;
countries, they include a considerable variety of experience with&#13;
both growth and distribution. Table 4 contains the statistical&#13;
data underlying the graphical analysis of these countries in&#13;
Figure 1. It also shows the growth rates of per capita income&#13;
of the lower 60 percent and its relation to the country average (p&#13;
The countries in Table 4 have been classified into&#13;
three groups on the basis of two criteria: the income share of&#13;
the lower 60 percent in the latest year and the share of the increase&#13;
in income going to this group over the period. The five countries&#13;
in Group I have a terminal share ranging from 28 to 39 percent&#13;
and incremental shares above 30 percent. At the other extreme,&#13;
the three countries in Group III have terminal shares in the range&#13;
of 18 to 21 percent and incremental shares of only 16 to 18 per-&#13;
cent. Distribution in the former group is considerably better&#13;
than the Kuznets curve in Figure 1 and in the latter qroup&#13;
considerably worse. The four countries in Group II are close to&#13;
the average relation.&#13;
In order to determine the scope for improvement in&#13;
distributional performance, it is useful to focus on the experience&#13;
of Group I. Taiwan, Yugoslavia and Korea have maintained relatively&#13;
good distribution along with rapid growth over the period indicated.&#13;
They have in common a relatively equal distribution of assets at&#13;
the beginning of the period observed, largely as a result of&#13;

political changes following World War II. The Taiwan-Korea develop-&#13;
ment strategy included substantial initial land reforms, great&#13;
emphasis on education, and an overall strategy favoring labor-&#13;
intensive expansion in the nonagricultural sectors, especially&#13;
labor-intensive manufactured exports./ In Yugoslavia, the social-&#13;
ization of the means of production combined with large transfers&#13;
of income from richer to poorer regions have been the principal&#13;
factors favoring egalitarian growth.2-/ These three countries have&#13;
provided the largest absolute increases to the income of the poor,&#13;
with incremental shares accruing to the lower 60 percent ranging&#13;
between .31 and .40.&#13;
By contrast, Sri Lanka provides an example of a sustained&#13;
policy of improving distribution through income transfers, without&#13;
the parallel achievement of high growth.3/ The incremental share&#13;
of the lower group in Sri Lanka exceeded 50 percent, but there&#13;
was also a reduction in resources available for investment which&#13;
contributed to lower growth and rising unemployment.&#13;

In summary, this range of country experience suggests&#13;
the following conclusions that provide a background for our&#13;
projections:&#13;
(a) Differences in distributional policies have been&#13;
at least as important to poverty alleviation as&#13;
differences in aggregate growth rates.&#13;
(b) A marginal share for the lowest 60 percent of income&#13;
recipients of about 40 percent is as high as has&#13;
been observed in countries in which growth has been&#13;
1/&#13;
sustained at reasonable levels.&#13;
(c) Substantial improvements in income distribution&#13;
have taken place under a variety of policies.&#13;
The market mechanism has been the principal&#13;
instrument in Taiwan, which was&#13;
not impeded by highly unequal distribution of&#13;
land and other assets to start with. Income trans-&#13;
fers for investment or consumption have been&#13;
important in Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka.&#13;
(d) The time series evidence supports the cross-section&#13;
results as far as the worsening phase of inequality&#13;
iR concerned.  There is no documented case of a countr3&#13;
that has avoided the initial worsening in income&#13;
distribution that is implied by uneven sectoral&#13;
1/ The only higher increment in our sample is Sri Lanka (51%),&#13;
where high redistribution through the budget impeded the&#13;
growth of the poor as well as the rich and has since been&#13;
modified. A similar modification of strongly redistributive&#13;
policies in favor of growth has recently taken place in&#13;
Tanzania and Cuba although information is not available as&#13;
to their effects.&#13;

growth; Taiwan has come the clcsest to main-&#13;
taining the relatively equal shares that are&#13;
1/&#13;
typical of the poorest countries.&#13;
(e) Although there is little time series&#13;
evidence for developing countries at&#13;
higher income levels, the theoretical&#13;
case for improvement due to-the automatic working&#13;
of economic forces is not strong. Mexico and&#13;
Brazil illustrate the likelihood of continued&#13;
worsening of income distribution well above the&#13;
level of 1000 Kravis dollars in the absence of&#13;
2/&#13;
effective policies to counteract this tendency.&#13;
1/ Fei, Ranis and Kuo (1979) show that there was some worsening&#13;
in distribution up to 1968 and some improvement since then.&#13;
g The Brazilian experience has been widely debated. See, for&#13;
example, Bacha and Taylor (forthcoming), Langoni (1973) and&#13;
Fishlow (1972).&#13;

III. THE SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT&#13;
The prospects for the year 2000 described by the&#13;
Base Case can scarcely be regarded as satisfactory either by the&#13;
countries concerned or by the world community. They are a far&#13;
cry from targets such as abolishing absolute poverty by the&#13;
end of this century. In this section we will examine a realistic&#13;
range of possibilities for further reducing poverty through a&#13;
combination of accelerating GNP growth, improving the distribu-&#13;
tion of income and reducing population growth.&#13;
Alternative Policies&#13;
The first step is to establish feasible improvements in&#13;
performance in each of these dimensions on the basis of country&#13;
experience.1" We then examine the impact that such improvements&#13;
might have on global poverty by the year 2000. The effects of&#13;
each type of policy will be simulated separately and then in&#13;
various combinations.&#13;
Accelerating Growth. We have seen that the GNP growth&#13;
rates used for the Base Case projection already imply a signifi-&#13;
cant acceleration in growth of the low income countries. The&#13;
studies upon which these projections are based conclude that an&#13;
acceleration of this order can be achieved largely through&#13;
domestic policy changes aimed at increasing domestic savings and&#13;
efficiency in resource use without a major change in the inter-&#13;
national environment.&#13;
1/ We examined but rejected the alternative of deriving an&#13;
optimum degree of redistribution by assuming a welfare&#13;
function and a hypothetical growth tradeoff, since it is&#13;
not possible to get plausible estimates of the latter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Higher levels of concessional assistance and improve-&#13;
ments in international markets would make possible higher growth&#13;
rates for these countries. To establish an optimistic range for&#13;
this improvement, we assume that the growth rates for the&#13;
countries in Group A could be increased by one percentage point&#13;
for the period 1980 to 2000. This increase corresponds to the&#13;
optimistic alternative used in current World Bank projections&#13;
(1979).&#13;
An increase in growth in the poor countries from 4.7&#13;
to 5.7 percent will require an increase in foreign exchange&#13;
availability of about the same magnitude. The international&#13;
policies required to achieve such an increase include substantial&#13;
trade liberalization, particularly in the products that can be&#13;
exported by the poorer countries, and an increase of some&#13;
20 percent in concessional lending to the poor countries.&#13;
Although this increase would imply a rise in the share of GNP&#13;
devoted to official development assistance (ODA) by the OECD&#13;
countries from the present level of 0.35 percent, it would be&#13;
substantially less than the international target of 0.70 percent&#13;
1/&#13;
if it could be concentrated in the poorest countries.&#13;
1/ Fuller discussions of the possibilities of increasing&#13;
growth of the poor countries and the implications for trade&#13;
and aid policies are given in World Bank (1978, 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Improving Distribution. The experience with policies&#13;
affecting income distribution has been discussed in the previous&#13;
section. The best results were obtained by Taiwan, Yugoslavia,&#13;
and Korea, in which between 30 percent and 40 percent of the&#13;
increment in income went to the bottom 60 percent of the popula-&#13;
tion and rapia growtn was sustained.   These countries now have&#13;
distributions that compare favorably to the industrialized&#13;
countries (Ahluwalia, 1976).&#13;
To estimate an upper limit to the possibility for redis-&#13;
tributinq income without substantially disrupting growth from this&#13;
experience, we assume that 45 Percent of the increment of GNP will&#13;
qo to the bottom 60 percent. This is hiqher than the incremental&#13;
share observed in any developing country except Sri Lanka, where&#13;
growth was substantially reduced. It corresponds to an incremen-&#13;
tal share of about 25 percent to the lowest 40 percent, which is&#13;
as high as the average share in almost any country (Ahluwalia,&#13;
1976). While this assumption may be technically feasible for&#13;
any country, it is barely conceivable for all developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
The requirements of such a strategy have been exten-&#13;
sively discussed both in general terms and for particular&#13;
countries.- While many elements of distributional policies remain&#13;
untested and speculative, there is substantial agreement that&#13;
the benefits of growth accruing to the poor can be increased&#13;
through policies which (a) increase "linkage" of the poor to the&#13;
faster-growing segments of the economy so as to increase the&#13;
flow of indirect benefits; and (b) provide much greater&#13;
direct support to productive activities upon which the poor&#13;
are heavily dependent and which have a potential for efficient&#13;
expansion.&#13;
Some of the elements of such a strategy serve both to&#13;
increase GNP and to improve its distribution. Policies aimed&#13;
at removing incentives for excessive use of capital in indivi-&#13;
dual sectors and thus helping to increase employment are obvious&#13;
examples. However, there are also policies which may have adverse&#13;
effects upon GNP growth, at least in the short run. Diversion&#13;
of investment resources into activities aimed at improving the&#13;
productivity of the poor may involve such costs in the initial&#13;
stages. In many countries an adequate flow of the benefits of&#13;
growth to the poor can only be ensured if steps are also taken&#13;
to correct the highly skewed distribution of productive assets,&#13;
especially agricultural land.&#13;
1/ See Chenery, Ahluwalia, Bell, Duloy and Jolly (1974) and the&#13;
country studies cited above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
We conclude that on both theoretical and empirical&#13;
grounds some loss of growth can be anticipated if a target of&#13;
distributing 45 percent of the increment of GNP to the lowest&#13;
60 percent is achieved. The most familiar argument for the&#13;
growth loss is the decline in savings that is likely if income&#13;
is shifted from the rich to the poor, since private saving,&#13;
which is done mainly by upper income groups, is likely to fall.&#13;
There are also adverse effects upon incentives to domestic&#13;
private investors arising from the adoption of radical distri-&#13;
butional policies. To allow for these adverse effects&#13;
we have assumed a growth loss arising from the implementation&#13;
of the distributional objective. Specifically, we postulate&#13;
that the rate of growth of GNP will fall in proportion to the&#13;
decline in the income share of the richest decile compared&#13;
to its share in the Base Case.J/&#13;
Reducing Population Growth. The third element affecting&#13;
the scale of global poverty is the rate of growth of population.&#13;
The scope for further improvements in this area over the next&#13;
two decades above what is assumed in the Base Case should not&#13;
be exaggerated. There are a number of factors making for rapid&#13;
population growth in developing countries, not least the decline&#13;
in mortality initially generated by the control of communicable&#13;
diseases, which can be expected to continue in the future with&#13;
a sustained rise in living standards. An offsetting decline in&#13;
fertility has begun in many countries, the rate being determined&#13;
by a large number of socio-economic changes. While popu-&#13;
lation control programs can facilitate this process when other&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
conditions are favorable, they have not been shown to accelerate&#13;
it to any great degree.&#13;
For the present analysis, we assume that the feasible&#13;
scope for reducing population growth in each country is given by the&#13;
difference in growth rates between the Medium Variant in the United&#13;
Nations (1975) population projections and the Low Variant, modified&#13;
for more recent information on fertility. We have accordingly reduced&#13;
the population growth rates of the Base Case!/in the same proportion.&#13;
The results for groups of developing countries are shown below.&#13;
"Reduced Population Growth" implies roughly a 10 percent decline&#13;
in the rate of increase in each group of countries to the year&#13;
2000. This limited decline reflects the substantial lead time&#13;
required for population control policies to take effect.&#13;

Alternative Projections&#13;
The effectiveness of these three types of policies&#13;
in alleviating poverty will be demonstrated by simulating their&#13;
effects to the year 2000 and comparing them to the Base Case.&#13;
The analysis is designed to bring out the relative effective-&#13;
ness of each approach for the main groups of countries and to&#13;
define feasible objectives for international action.&#13;
Although we have examined a large number of policy&#13;
mixes, the main results can be summarized by considering first&#13;
the three policies in isolation and then in two combinations.&#13;
These are set out in Table 5 in order of their effectiveness&#13;
in reducing poverty. Since differences in performance within&#13;
the country groups add little to the general conclusions, we&#13;
assume that each policy applies equally to all countries in a&#13;
group.V/ We will use two measures of poverty alleviation in evalua-&#13;
tlng the xesults: the number of people below the absolute poverty&#13;
line and the Per caDita innome of the relativelv noor, definAd hy&#13;
the lowest 40 percent.&#13;
Option A: Reduced Population Growth. Since the Base Case is&#13;
relatively optimistic about the possibilities of lowering&#13;
fertility, the scope for further reductions in population growth&#13;
in this century is limited. Given the young age structure in&#13;
developing countries, even a dramatic decline in total fertility&#13;
1/  The differences in initial conditions produce a considerable&#13;
variation in country behavior, however, as was illustrated&#13;
in the poverty projections in Figure 4 above.&#13;

rates would not lead to a much more rapid decline in population&#13;
growth until after 2000. Simulations based on the lower&#13;
U.N. estimates reduce absolute poverty by about 15 percent in&#13;
2000 compared to the Base Case and increase the per capita&#13;
income of the bottom 40 percent by 10 percent. However, as&#13;
shown below, the impact of population policy is more important&#13;
in conjunction with other measures.&#13;
Option B: Accelerated Growth of Poor Countries. This option&#13;
illustrates the main contribution that policies of the advanced&#13;
countries make to alleviating world poverty. A one percent&#13;
increase in growth of poor countries would eliminate in large&#13;
part the growth lag between Group A and the other two groups.&#13;
The result is to reduce world poverty by 30 percent in 2000&#13;
compared to the Base projection.&#13;
Option C: Incremental Redistribution. This option assumes that&#13;
all developing countries adopt effective redistributive policies&#13;
which ensure an incremental share of 45 percent of increased income&#13;
for the lowest 60 per-&#13;
7  cent, wth. a mCodIeLrate loss in per capita growth (from 4.0 to 3.5&#13;
percent overall). In the low income countries this would have&#13;
about the same effect on reducing poverty and raising the incomes&#13;
of the poor as did Option B. Further reductions in poverty&#13;
would come in the middle and high income groups. On balance,&#13;
the results suggest that focussing on improvements in distribu-&#13;
tion may be as effective in reducing world poverty as the&#13;
accelerated growth option.&#13;
Option D: Redistribution plus Accelerated Growth. Although&#13;
the results of combining Options B and C are not entirely&#13;
additive, the two policies together produce a substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
improvement over either one in isolation.    The combination&#13;
of accelerated growth of poor countries and a larger incremental&#13;
share to the poor within each country completely eliminates&#13;
the growth lag between the poor and the rest of the population&#13;
of developing countries. As a result, while the total GNP&#13;
of developing countries would be 5 percent less in 2000, the&#13;
per capita income of the bottom 40 percent would be 45 percent&#13;
higher. A tradeoff of-this magnitude would clearly be desirable&#13;
on most social welfare functions.&#13;
Option E: Maximum Improvement. The greatest improvement on our&#13;
assumptions results from combining all three policies, which is&#13;
equivalent to adding lower population growth to Option D. The&#13;
most significant effect is on the number of absolute poor,&#13;
which is reduced by a further 15 percent from Option D. The&#13;
main interest in this result, which compounds three optimistic&#13;
sets of assumptions, is to show that the elimination of absolute&#13;
poverty by the year 2000 is not a credible policy objective.&#13;
Even though the number of poor is reduced to a third of its&#13;
present level, more than 200 million remain below the poverty&#13;
line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
Policy Implications&#13;
To bring out the policy implications of these simu-&#13;
lations, we will restate the results in a more general form,&#13;
first from the standpoint of individual countries and then for&#13;
international policy. Finally, we return to the question&#13;
of defining policy objectives in more realistic terms.&#13;
Figure 5 shows the effects of both raising income&#13;
and improving its distribution on the level of absolute poverty&#13;
in a representative country.- It shows that at low income&#13;
levels there is relatively little difference in the poverty&#13;
level between the average (Kuznets curve) and the best observed&#13;
distribution. In the middle income range, however, the propor-&#13;
tion in poverty is much more sensitive to changes in distribu-&#13;
tion. The figure permits the determination of combinations&#13;
of increased per capita income and improved distribution that&#13;
lead to any desired reduction in poverty.&#13;
In exploring policy alternatives for individual&#13;
countries, it is also necessary to take account of the rate of&#13;
growth that can be generated with the existing economic struc-&#13;
ture. A poor country such as Indonesia that can move quite&#13;
rapidly parallel to the Kuznets curve may make more progress&#13;
in reducing poverty than a slow growing country with better&#13;
1/ Since the figure is computed for a Lorenz curve based on a&#13;
lognormal distribution, it needs to be modified to apply&#13;
to the actual distribution of any given country. The country&#13;
scatter is plotted from poverty shares, shown in Table 1,&#13;
which are not entirely consistent with the income shares&#13;
shown because of differences in individual distributional&#13;
patterns.&#13;

distribution such as India or Bangladesh, as was illustrated&#13;
in Figure 4. On the other hand, in the typical middle income&#13;
countries, which tend to have more rapid growth and less equal&#13;
distributions, improved distribution is often more effective&#13;
in reducing poverty than accelerated growth. Whatever the&#13;
starting point, however, it should not be necessary to wait&#13;
until per capita income rises above 1000 ICP dollars to&#13;
reduce absolute poverty below 10 percent.&#13;
Turning to the relation between national and inter-&#13;
national policies, we have designed Figure 6 to illustrate the&#13;
possible tradeoffs involved. International trade and aid&#13;
policies have their main impact on growth and relatively&#13;
little effect on internal distribution. The figure shows the&#13;
various combinations of accelerating growth of poor countries&#13;
and improved internal distribution that yield the same rise in&#13;
the per capita income of the bottom 40 percent for the sample&#13;
as a whole.&#13;
The options presented in Table 5 delimit a feasible&#13;
area of policy choice with Option D as the best achieveable.&#13;
Since solutions B and C give about the same rise in the income&#13;
of the poor, a curve connecting these two points would indicate&#13;
intermediate combinations that have the same effect. While&#13;
this analysis is largely illustrative, it is at least sugges-&#13;
tive of the relative importance of internal and external policies&#13;

We conclude that it would be quite feasible to design&#13;
national and international policies that would eliminate the&#13;
lag between the growth of the incomes of the poor and the&#13;
growth of developing countries as a whole--and indeed of the&#13;
rest of the world. This result would require very substantial&#13;
modifications in both national and international policies that&#13;
are unlikely to take place without a considerable reordering&#13;
of social priorities. Although even this result would not&#13;
eliminate poverty in every country by the year 2000, it would&#13;
bring this objective within reach for most of them.&#13;

Methodological Appendix&#13;
Our basic approach has been to build up a world income distribution from&#13;
the observations of 36 individual developing countries. For each country&#13;
we generate an income distribution, a time series of GDP, and a time&#13;
series of population. From this we obtain the income accruing to deciles&#13;
of each country in each year. In any particular year there are thus 360&#13;
separate population groups with their corresponding income. Treating these&#13;
as individual observations in an LDC world enables us to look at income&#13;
distribution over time, over regions, and over a variety of assumptions&#13;
concerning the individual distributions themselves.&#13;
The time period being considered in this analysis is the 41-years 1960&#13;
through 2000. For the first sixteen of these years consistent data were&#13;
obtained from the World Bank Social and Economic Data Bank, for the final 25&#13;
(1976-2000), projections of GDP made by the staff of the Bank in mid-1977&#13;
were used; future population was assumed to grow according to Bank staff&#13;
estimates made in 1977-78. Income distribution observations were taken&#13;
from Jainm/.&#13;
Table AI presents a list of the countries in our sample; the year and&#13;
type of income distribution survey and Gini coefficient of the distribution&#13;
in the year of observation. For 3 countries in our sample, income distri-&#13;
bution data was not available; for 7 others we deemed it unreliable, and&#13;
2/&#13;
thus distributions were "borrowed" from a cross-section Kuznets curve-!&#13;
In so doing, we assumed that the country lay directly in the Kuznets curve&#13;
in 1975. For one country, Iran, we have arbitrarily used estimates&#13;
based on observed inequality in other middle income, relatively&#13;
unequal countries.&#13;

s a    are the coefficient of the Kuznets curve -/(as reported&#13;
above, but in fractions rather than percent), and "*" indicates&#13;
the base year of observation of the income distribution.&#13;
The major objective of our redistribution experiments is to allocate&#13;
to the bottom 60% of a population, 45% of the marginal income in that&#13;
country during a specified time period. What we have to work with, however,&#13;
is average shares and, of course, the growth of income 6ver the period.&#13;
It is fairly straightforward to show:&#13;
7) m   a=tR a&#13;
R-1&#13;
where a is average share, m is marginal share and R is the ratio of income&#13;
(per capita) in period t to income in period o for the country as a whole.&#13;
From this it follows that:&#13;
m(R-l) + a&#13;
8) a  =     R&#13;
Knowing the terminal share, one can compute the growth rate of the share&#13;
that is necessary for the initial share to reach the terminal share in&#13;
the terminal year. This can then be applied year by year to each of the&#13;
six lower deciles and then for each year the sum of the shares of these&#13;
deciles can be calculated. Given that the ten deciles must sum to unity,&#13;
we then have the control sum of the top four deciles in each year. This is&#13;
compared to the share that would have prevailed along the Kuznets curve.&#13;
The top four deciles are then reduced in proportion.&#13;
1/ The function is in base 10 logarithms so as to be consistent with&#13;
the Ahluwalia wfork.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
To look at the trade-off between distribution and growth, remember&#13;
that in a simple growth model:&#13;
9) Yit   yit-l + Iit-l   i&#13;
10) Iit   Sit + Fit&#13;
where I and S are Investment and savings, k is the incremental capital to&#13;
output ratio and F is foreign capital inflow. In addition, assume a simple&#13;
savings function which distinguishes between the deciles of the population.&#13;
11) Sit =      a; yijt&#13;
where a; is the average savings propensity of the ith decile. Combining&#13;
5), 8), 9), 10), and 11) we get:&#13;
12) Y            + 1   [i    l+Yi   Z a~ (mj(tl-) +&#13;
)it     it-1   ki [lt-1 +io        i aJ(; Y        +aiJ41&#13;
making it clear that the marginal share of the ith decile (mi) has an&#13;
effect on the level and thus the growth of GDP.&#13;
In the actual simulation run for this paper, we made a somewhat different&#13;
set of assumptions. Rather than use the entire model, we assumed that a&#13;
loss in growth would occur as a result of a loss of share by the top decile.&#13;
In each year, the income share of the tenth decile as calculated parallel&#13;
to the Kuznets curve is compared to the share that would have to prevail if&#13;
the bottom 60% of the population were to receive 45% of the marginal GDP in&#13;
the previous year. The resulting ratio is then applied to the original&#13;
growth rate (exogenous) which is thus reduced in proportion.&#13;

The projections for 1975-85 were embodied in a World Bank Study l/and&#13;
have been adapted directly from that work. For 1985-90, the terminal growth&#13;
rates of the 1975-85 period were used, while for the period 1990-2000, the&#13;
estimates were made directly by the authors of the paper. Four countries,&#13;
Burma, Uganda, Zaire, and Taiwan were not a part of the Prospects study&#13;
and projections for them were adapted from internal World Bank documents.&#13;

Kuznets Curve&#13;
An assumption that the income distributions of countries are unchanged&#13;
over the 41-year time period is unrealistic, thus it was necessary to&#13;
incorporate what is known as the Kuznets curve. This posits an income&#13;
distribution that changes with income per capita, worsening up to a certain&#13;
income per capita and then slowly improving at levels above. Fortunately,&#13;
estimations of this curve on data similar to ours have recently been made.1/&#13;
The regressions reported give estimates of the parameters for the income&#13;
shares lowest 20, 40 and 60 percent of the population as well as the top&#13;
20 percent. These estimates are of the form:&#13;
1)  Share (%) = f(log(YPC), (log(YPC)) )&#13;
Thus, the shares of each of the quintiles can be calculated from the&#13;
equations on a consistent basis, the 4th quintile being the residual.&#13;
The coefficients are as follows:&#13;
Share            Coefficient on log (Y)    Coefficient on (log(Y))2&#13;
Top 20                     89.95                   -17.56&#13;
Second 20                 -16.43                     3.50&#13;
Middle 20                 -29.14                     5.75&#13;
Fourth 20                 -27.41                     5.25&#13;
Low 20                    -16.97                     3.06&#13;
Using the year of the observation of the income distribution as the&#13;
base (i.e. implicitly adjusting the constant term), these equations can be&#13;
used to calculate the share of the quintiles for each of the years of our&#13;
analysis. We thus assume all distributions will move in parallel to the&#13;
Kuznets curve.&#13;

sample estimates (page 311).&#13;

where k* is the year of observation of income distribution&#13;
Yik = income per capita in the ith country in the kth year&#13;
S;  = share of the jth quintile&#13;
i and   are the coefficients of Kuznets curve.&#13;
Our basic unit is however the decile, thus, for computational convenience&#13;
we make the following further assumption; the shares of the two individual&#13;
deciles in each quintile remain constant over time.-/ Using this methodology,&#13;
we derive the income distribution statistics for each country.&#13;
Kravis factors&#13;
If we are looking at world income distributions, it should be on an&#13;
homogeneous basis. Following on the work of Kravis et al -/, we recomputed&#13;
the 1970 GDP per capita to reflect the purchasing power parities, and then&#13;
used known growth rates of real     GDP per capita to obtain 1975 base year&#13;
data for our model. The Kravis factors are shown in Table A3 together with&#13;
the values of GDP per capita in 1970 and 1975. It should be noted that&#13;
seven of the countries in our sample were actually studied in an earlier&#13;
work by Kravis3/  We have used the    factors as estimated by the "shortcut"&#13;
method (1978) rather than the direct one (1975).&#13;
1/ This could potentially cause significant distortions, particularly&#13;
where shares are rapidly changing. In our analysis, it occasionally&#13;
causes minor inversions between the 8th and 9th deciles. As this&#13;
particular region of the distribution is not germane to our paper,&#13;
we have not attempted to correct it.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
At this point, several methods were considered to incorporate&#13;
the Kravis factors. If the Kravis factors are applied to income per&#13;
capita before projecting income distributions, then not only do the&#13;
regressions of the Kuznets curve need to be re-estimated, but in addition,&#13;
many of the rapidly developing countries, whose incomes are multiplied&#13;
by Kravis factors, quickly get beyond the range of the regressions and&#13;
produce implausible results. We considered solving this problem by using&#13;
Kravis factors that themselves are functions of income per capita, but&#13;
the difficulties inherent in this approach rendered it impractical. There-&#13;
fore, we tarried out the analysis, the distribution, and the experiments&#13;
on re-distribution, before applying the Kravis factors, making this final&#13;
transformation on a country basis after all country analysis, but before&#13;
any global analysis. Thus, we restrict the use of this&#13;
transformation to providing a means of adding up the world. The Kuznets&#13;
curve itself was transformed at the mean value of the Kravis factor (1.99)&#13;
for the sample in Ahluwalia.&#13;

The Model&#13;
The alternatives considered in the analysis can be categorized as&#13;
1) redistribution, 2) increased growth of GDP, and 3) decreased growth&#13;
of population. Of these, only the first presents a significant analytical&#13;
problem. Changes in GDP and in population involve only simple modifications&#13;
of exogenous data used to calculate GDP per capita and do not, in our&#13;
framework, involve changes in structure or behavior. The treatment of&#13;
redistribution, however, is more involved, if only because the literature&#13;
on quantitative policy and behavior is very thin. Accordingly, we have&#13;
specified a simple model as a framework for our analysis. GDP and population&#13;
are exogenous and are taken from various World Bank studies on individual&#13;
countries as well as the global analysis carried out in 1977. GDP&#13;
projections emerge from consistent, essentially trade-limited macromodels&#13;
for individual countries. They are thus an embodiment of World Bank judgment&#13;
as to the potential performance of a country under average conditions.&#13;
The model, starting with GDP and population,proceeds to income per capita,&#13;
to the projected income distribution,and to the projected income of each&#13;
decile in the sample panel.&#13;

Oi, a  are the coefficient of the Kuznets curve -/(as reported&#13;
above, but in fractions rather than percent), and "*" indicates&#13;
the base year of observation of the income distribution.&#13;
The major objective of our redistribution experiments is to allocate&#13;
to the bottom 60% of a population, 45% of the marginal income in that&#13;
country during a specified time period. What we have to work with, however,&#13;
is average shares and, of course, the growth of income over the period.&#13;
It is fairly straightforward to show:&#13;
7)M    atR-a0&#13;
R-1&#13;
where a is average share, m is marginal share and R is the ratio of income&#13;
(per capita) in period t to income in period o for the country as a whole.&#13;
From this it follows that:&#13;
m(R-l) + a&#13;
8) at =&#13;
Knowing the terminal share, one can compute the growth rate of the share&#13;
that is necessary for the initial share to reach the terminal share in&#13;
the terminal year. This can then be applied year by year to each of the&#13;
six lower deciles and then for each year the sum of the shares of these&#13;
deciles can be calculated. Given that the ten deciles must sum to unity,&#13;
we then have the control sum of the top four deciles in each year. This is&#13;
compared to the share that would have prevailed along the Kuznets curve.&#13;
The top four deciles are then reduced in proportion.&#13;
1/ The function is in base 10 logarithms so as to be consistent with&#13;
the Ahluwalia work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
To look at the trade-off between distribution and growth, remember&#13;
that in a simple growth model:&#13;
9)Y y    Y      +1I    /k&#13;
it    it-1     it-1  i&#13;
10) Iit    Sit +  it&#13;
where I and S are Investment and savings, k is the incremental capital to&#13;
output ratio and F is foreign capital inflow. In addition, assume a simple&#13;
savings function which distinguishes between the deciles of the population.&#13;
11) Sit 2      a; Yijt&#13;
where a   is the average savings propensity of the ith decile.     Combining&#13;
5), 8), 9), 10), and 11) we get:&#13;
12)Y ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +  [Fit.+Y lo E at (mj(t &#13;
it ~_it-1     ki   it-1 +   io    i aJ( y_t l  -) + ; ai24&#13;
making it clear that the marginal share of the ith decile (mi) has an&#13;
effect on the level and thus the growth of GDP.&#13;
In the actual simulation run for this paper, we made a somewhat different&#13;
set of assumptions. Rather than use the entire model, we assumed that a&#13;
loss in growth would occur as a result of a loss of share by the top decile.&#13;
In each year, the income share of the tenth decile as calculated parallel&#13;
to the Kuznets curve is compared to the share that would have to prevail if&#13;
the bottom 60% of the population were to receive 45% of the marginal GDP in&#13;
the previous year. The resulting ratio is then applied to the original&#13;
growth rate (exogenous) which is thus reduced in proportion.&#13;

            benefits have only reached the poor to a very limited
            degree. The poorest countries have grown only slowly, and
            within most developing countries the growth processes under
            way are such that the incomes of the poor increase much more
            slowly than the average. Little has been done to estimate
            the real possibilities for significantly reducing the
            poverty problem within a reasonable period. This paper uses
            a quantitative framework to project the numbers of people in
            poverty under different assumptions about GNP growth,
            population growth and changes in income distribution.
            Although it makes no claim to model in detail the complex
            interactions between development processes, national and
            international policies and patterns of income distribution,
            the analysis helps to clarify policy choices. Its
            conclusions demonstrate that the elimination of absolute
            poverty by the end of this century is a highly unlikely
            prospect; to achieve any substantial reduction would require
            combinations of policies designed to accelerate the growth
            of poor countries, to distribute the benefits of growth more
            equitably, and to slow the rapid pace of population increase
            in these countries.
