On-lendinf Terms:   The IDA Credit will be made to the Kyrgyz Republic Government (KRG), which&#13;
will on-lend the proceeds through a Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and&#13;
Development (FERD) to finance a credit component of US$14.2 million, and d&#13;
technical assistance component of US$800,000 (including contingencies). KRG&#13;
will charge the FERD a variable interest rate equal to the rate of 10-year&#13;
(hereinafter long term) US Treasury Bonds. The FERD will provide subloans&#13;
denominated in US dollars, to eligible private enterprises at the prevailing market&#13;
rate charged by local commercial banks for their loans in US dollars. Borrowing&#13;
enterprises will assume the foreign exchange risk between the US dollar and the&#13;
Kyrgyz Som (KGS). The re-lending terms and conditions will be reviewed&#13;
periodically to ensure that they continue to reflect market rates, and cover the&#13;
cost and risk of the FERD. Subloans will have maturities not exceeding eight&#13;
years, including up to one year's grace. The loan to the FERD will be for 15&#13;
years, including a grace period of five years. During IDA's ten-year grace&#13;
period, reflows from subloan repayments will be retained, and relent on the same&#13;
terms and conditions by the FERD. The foreign exchange risk between the SDR&#13;
and the US dollar will be borne by KRG.&#13;
The technical assistance component is co-financed in parallel by a proposed&#13;
US$2.5 million grant of the Japanese Government. Proceeds of the Credit and&#13;
grants will be made available by KRG to enterprise beneficiaries as partially&#13;
reimbursable advances to cover technical assistance; to the Ministry of Finance&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1         The Kyrgyz Republic (KR), with an estimated per capita income of&#13;
US$830 in 1993, is among the smallest and poorest of the former Soviet Republics with&#13;
modest natural resources but a literate population of 4.4 million.  The present&#13;
government, headed by President Askar Akaev who led the pro-reform and pro-&#13;
democracy movement, is committed to macroeconomic stabilization and the establishment&#13;
of a market economy. To achieve these goals, the Kyrgyz Republic Government (KRG)&#13;
looks primarily to the international finance institutions for advice and financial support.&#13;
Kyrgyzstan was one of the four Former Soviet Union (FSU) recipients of World Bank&#13;
assistance under the 1992 Technical Co-operation Program (TCP). Despite a large terms&#13;
of trade deterioration and declining output, the KRG has pressed on with reforms,&#13;
abandoned the rouble zone and introduced the Kyrgyz Som (KGS), the new currency.&#13;
Its privatization program has made substantial progress.&#13;
1.2         The private enterprise sector is growing rapidly as a result of the&#13;
privatization program and new entry spurred by other complementary on-going economic&#13;
and institutional reforms. The Kyrgyz Republic Government and the emerging private&#13;
sector need support to ensure success of the reform program. This is particularly&#13;
important since the Kyrgyz Republic is at the forefront of the Commonwealth of&#13;
Independent States (CIS) in reforming its economy. Policy support for this program of&#13;
reforms is being provided by the Bank Group under the recently approved Privatization&#13;
and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC), which focuses particularly on the&#13;
acceleration of the privatization program and creating a better policy environment for&#13;
private sector development. The proposed project has been designed in this context to&#13;
support an integrated program of financial and technical assistance to enterprises to build&#13;
up their competitiveness in a market economy. The Credit proceeds would be channelled&#13;
through a Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD) to be managed&#13;
by a private Enterprise Fund Manager (FM) being recruited internationally. The FM will&#13;
work with a counterpart Kyrgyz commercial bank, satisfactory to the Bank, and will also&#13;
manage the technical assistance support to enterprises. These institutional arrangements&#13;
have been devised to implement the project on a timely and urgent basis, and thus&#13;
provide needed resources to private enterprises.  These arrangements are required&#13;
because local banks do not have either the operational capacity or the requisite capital&#13;
base to support a lending program of the magnitude currently needed to support the&#13;
investment needs of private sector enterprises. Local banks will be encouraged to assist&#13;
in co-financing individual projects through provision of working capital or medium term&#13;
loans in local currency, and may be offered the opportunity to purchase FERD loans if&#13;
they develop sufficient capacity in the future to administer the loan portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE INDUSTRIAL AND ENTERPRISE SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
2.1          Although one of the least industrialized republics of the FSU, the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic's industrial sector accounts for a relatively high 30 percent of GDP and 20&#13;
percent of employment whereas agriculture accounts for 40 percent of GDP and 40&#13;
percent of employment. Most medium and large Kyrgyz enterprises were established as&#13;
elements of a much larger production system. They are thus either producers of&#13;
intermediate parts or products for other plants in the FSU or assembled final products&#13;
from components or inputs procured from other republics. This strategy attached a high&#13;
value to economies of scale exemplified by very large plant sizes and a high degree of&#13;
specialization. Installed plant capacities were geared to serve the national or regional&#13;
markets and rarely reflected local supply or demand considerations. Typical examples&#13;
of these are the million unit truck radiator plants, the vending machine plant for the&#13;
entire FSU, kitchen equipment plant for naval vessels and the float glass plant established&#13;
to supply all of central Asia.&#13;
B. Progress in Privatization and Enterprise Reform&#13;
2.2          The Kyrgyz Republic Government (KRG) began economic reform,&#13;
stabilization and structural adjustment in 1991, much ahead of other countries of the&#13;
Former Soviet Union (FSU). The privatization program in particular, which forms an&#13;
important part of these reforms was accelerated during 1993. By June 1994,&#13;
approximately 4,800 enterprises, or roughly 40 percent of the State's assets had been&#13;
privatized. This performance is largely consistent with the initial targets set in the&#13;
privatization program. It is expected that an additional 35 percent of state assets would&#13;
be privatized by end 1996. The pace of privatization has been rapid in manufacturing&#13;
where some 221 enterprises, representing 39 percent of total State enterprise in the&#13;
medium-large category assets, had been privatized by October, 1993. Some 2,550 small-&#13;
scale enterprises (SSEs with less than 200 employees) in retail trade and services have&#13;
been privatized to date, out of an estimated total of 4,300 expected to be privatized.&#13;
While the program was speedily implemented, it suffered from some major drawbacks.&#13;
Competitive forms of transfer were dropped after some initial attempts. Shares were&#13;
transferred in large blocks to employees collectively, rather than individually, in the case&#13;
of industrial enterprises. Moreover, the privatized enterprises were set up as closed&#13;
companies which prevented any form of sale of shares to outsiders. Managers had&#13;
privileged access to large blocks of shares (as high as 25 percent) giving rise to&#13;
widespread perceptions of unfairness among the populace. Finally, the State Property&#13;
Fund (SPF, the privatization agency) restricted the activity profile of the privatized&#13;
enterprises merely precluding flexibility in restructuring.&#13;
2.3          These privatization and other related economic policy reform issues, which&#13;
shed doubt on privatized enterprises behavior, and capacity to move into the market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
economy, are being addressed by the Government in its new Program for 1994-1995,&#13;
approved by Parliament in December 1993, and agreed with IDA under the Privatization&#13;
and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC). The new Program establishes&#13;
competitive sales methods such as auctions and bidding against cash and vouchers for&#13;
small-scale enterprises and competitive cash bidding by individuals and groups for up to&#13;
70 percent of equity, combined with sale of 25 percent of equity through voucher&#13;
auctions, for medium and larger enterprises.&#13;
2.4         Implementation of the revised privatization program under PESAC is&#13;
progressing well. As of end October 1994, 90 joint-stock companies were auctioned&#13;
through 10 sets of cash auctions while 12 new investment funds are actively involved in&#13;
the mass privatization program. An additional 343 joint-stock companies are expected&#13;
to be auctioned off by June 1995. Sectoral and macro-economic policy issues impeding&#13;
the efficient functioning of private enterprises are also being successfully addressed under&#13;
PESAC including the lifting of controls over prices and profit margins, elimination of&#13;
compulsory State orders and supply contracts, elimination of export licensing and phased&#13;
elimination of export taxes, limiting the number and types of enterprises to be considered&#13;
monopolies and strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate and&#13;
clarify commercial transactions. In particular, a new company law and insolvency law&#13;
and new regulations on leases and registration of land titles, securities and companies are&#13;
being drafted. The above measures are progressively creating an appropriate enabling&#13;
environment to foster private sector activity. Through the PESAC operation, IDA will&#13;
continue to monitor the effectiveness of the measures and assist the Government with&#13;
other actions deemed necessary.&#13;
C. Structure and Performance&#13;
2.5             As the key characteristic of the industrial structure was its vertical&#13;
integration and heavy dependence on trade with other CIS enterprises, the breakdown in&#13;
inter-republican trade and payments arrangements has hit the industrial sector especially&#13;
hard. Industrial output was stagnant during the early 1990's. In 1992, real output was&#13;
estimated to have declined by 23 percent and to have fallen further by around 30 percent&#13;
in 1993. In 1991, inter republican imports and exports represented 45 and 35 percent&#13;
of GDP. Foreign trade dependence of the industrial sector was even higher, estimated&#13;
at over 75 percent of material inputs and outputs.&#13;
2.6             Accurate data on the distribution of firms by sub-sector or size is&#13;
unavailable. However, based on data compiled by the State Property Fund (SPF) in&#13;
1991, at the start of the privatization program, the distribution of enterprises by broad&#13;
activity categories and size is indicated in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. Out of a total of 5,270&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
state enterprises' employing 925,000 workers and managers, 4,300 (81.6 percent) were&#13;
small units (employing less than 200 workers) with about 24 percent of total&#13;
employment. Twenty very large enterprises (employing more than 5,000 workers)&#13;
accounted for 16 percent of employment and the remaining 950 were medium and large&#13;
enterprises with 60 percent of employment. The industrial sector including agro-industry&#13;
and construction comprised some 700 medium and large firms. Although the number of&#13;
industrial enterprise is quite large, there are a number of industries where a single or&#13;
small number of firms dominate the market (e.g. sugar, glass, sparkling wine etc.).&#13;
Moreover, enterprises in certain industries continue to be organized under holding&#13;
companies or Concerns. The most important Concerns cover construction (Kurulush);&#13;
food and beverage processing (Tamak'ash); gold, coal and other mining (Altyn and&#13;
Kumtor); pharmaceutical (Farmindustria); and forest industries (Lesprom). Although&#13;
the functions of Concerns have changed in the past few years, their presence and&#13;
activities in procurement and marketing could inhibit competition in these industrial&#13;
branches.&#13;
2.7              Accurate data on the breakdown of sectoral value added is also&#13;
unavailable, but some rough numbers presented below provide a qualitative picture of the&#13;
industrial sector (see project file for details). The food processing and beverage&#13;
industry has some 100 significant enterprises covering meat packing and dairy operations,&#13;
tobacco, oils and fats, sugar, candy, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and food&#13;
canning. Most agricultural raw materials are of local origin but packaging materials are&#13;
imported.  However, the sugar industry comprises four large refineries that were&#13;
designed to process 500,000 tons of raw Cuban sugar for sale throughout Central Asia.&#13;
The textiles sector comprises 13 multi-plant enterprises processing cotton (28,000&#13;
tons/yr.), wool (11,000 tons/yr.) and silk (600 tons/yr.). About 45 percent of production&#13;
is exported. Most textile plants are not integrated and specialize in individual products.&#13;
As a result of the Kyrgyz Republic's large sheep and cattle population, the leather and&#13;
fur garments industry is well developed with 10 leather tanning and footwear making&#13;
factories and 25 fur garment making plants. The wood and chemicals sub-sector is&#13;
fairly small and produces household chemicals, paints etc. for local consumption based&#13;
on imported inputs.&#13;
2.8              The two largest industrial sub-sectors are building materials and&#13;
engineering industries. The building materials industries comprise some 30 enterprises&#13;
employing over 10,000 workers under the Building Mate,ials Concern. Products include&#13;
float glass, sawn marble, bricks and cement.  Plants are large capital intensive&#13;
investments supplying products to a wide region. The engineering industries include&#13;
about 100 medium to large size plants, many producing defense related items and mostly&#13;
located in the Bishkek region. Products include defense equipment, fabricated metal&#13;
These figures refer to units with separate accounts. If broken down further by plants or establishments,&#13;
the number would exceed 11,000 units. However, small enterprises are mostly in the retail, catering,&#13;
and service activities and their number probably exceeds 9,500.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
products, auto and truck components, machine tools and some electrical components.&#13;
In addition, there are a large number of mining and metal processing industries of a&#13;
highly specialized nature including gold (2 tons/yr.), Uranium U308 (100 tons/yr.),&#13;
antimony (400 tons/yr.), mercury (2,100 tons/yr.) molybdenum (500 tons/yr.) and&#13;
various rare earths.&#13;
D. Recent Sectoral Developments&#13;
2.9             The breakdown in the trade and payments system as a result of the&#13;
disintegration of the FSU has had a severe negative impact on Kyrgyz industry, affecting&#13;
in particular, those which traded a substantial part of their output or input with other&#13;
republics. Industrial capacity utilization as of the end of 1993 ranged from 20 to 50&#13;
percent (based on one shift operations) with consumer goods industries serving local&#13;
markets operating at the higher limits. Enterprise managers face a complex set of&#13;
problems in keeping their businesses going. The most serious is the liquidity crisis&#13;
because of the ubiquitous lack of cash, particularly for financing transactions outside the&#13;
Republic. Complex barter arrangements involving several parties are undertaken to&#13;
obtain raw materials and proceeds of sales. Reduced number of days of operation,&#13;
involuntary salary cuts and redundancies (up to 30 percent in some enterprises) have been&#13;
implemented by enterprise management to cut costs and conserve scarce cash. Bank&#13;
credit is extremely scarce and relatively expensive (published interest rates do not reflect&#13;
loan costs because of large up-front commissions and compensating balances as high as&#13;
50 percent of the loan amount). The inability of commercial banks to provide export&#13;
credit and marketing advice is an additional problem inhibiting export activities of&#13;
enterprises.  Finally, the non-transparent tax system continues to bedevil enterprise&#13;
management. A serious problem faced by workers is the progressive loss of social and&#13;
infrastructural services (medical, heating, education) provided by large enterprises.&#13;
2.10            The prospects for revival of demand for Kyrgyz products in the CIS&#13;
is uncertain at best as GDP continues to fall steeply in most of the (FSU) republics. Also&#13;
the opening up of markets in the CIS has sharply changed market characteristics and&#13;
introduced competition from non CIS sources for the first time. Even if the trade and&#13;
payment system is strengthened, Kyrgyz enterprises will need to compete with other&#13;
suppliers in exporting to CIS markets in the same manner that they will need to do in&#13;
selling to hard currency markets. To successfully make this transition, enterprises will&#13;
need to dramatically upgrade product quality to international specifications, reduce&#13;
operating costs and meet strict delivery schedules. They will also need to build up&#13;
export marketing capability to support their sales drive in these markets.&#13;
2.11            Enterprises can make this transition efficiently if they are operating in&#13;
an environment which is not hobbled by market failures and policy distortions.&#13;
Enterprise reform and restructuring is needed not only to respond to relative price&#13;
adjustments, but also to correct the distortions of the old system whose priorities were&#13;
established to suit the needs of the FSU. The Kyrgyz Government has taken substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
steps in the past three years to lay the foundations of a free market economy. The&#13;
passage of a new constitution guaranteeing private property rights and the aggressive&#13;
implementation of a wide spread privatization program, even if faulted on certain aspects,&#13;
are notable achievements. A number of legal and regulatory measures have been enacted&#13;
to establish the basis for private commercial activity. At the same time, major economic&#13;
reforms have been implemented in the areas of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate&#13;
policies and the creation of new institutions. Sectoral issues are addressed under PESAC&#13;
(para. 2.4). There are a number of enterprise-level issues which need to be resolved&#13;
quickly if the enterprise sector is to adjust to the new economic realities of the market&#13;
place.&#13;
E. Enterprise Level Issues&#13;
2.12            Industrial enterprises face a wide variety of difficult problems although&#13;
the complexity varies by industrial branch. The consumer goods industries selling in the&#13;
domestic market have relatively fewer problems compared to the capital goods and&#13;
building materials industries that were designed to export a major part of their output to&#13;
the other republics. Most enterprises lack access to raw materials, consumable and&#13;
spares and thus cannot operate production lines efficiently at the present time. However,&#13;
even domestically oriented Kyrgyz enterprises will face strong competition from imports&#13;
as external trade is liberalized. Bringing about substantial improvements in productivity&#13;
at the enterprise level will require a change in management and worker mentality, the&#13;
incentive system for workers and managers, new investment to modernize obsolete plants&#13;
and substantial technical assistance to introduce modem management systems and&#13;
procedures, marketing techniques and distribution networks. Very few enterprises can&#13;
resolve these problems on their own and will need external assistance to address these&#13;
problems in a systematic manner. The major issues that need to be tackled for every&#13;
enterprise are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Training of management in modern managerial practices, particularly&#13;
in marketing and financial management;&#13;
(b)   Introduction of standardized cost accounting, production planning,&#13;
inventory control and other management information systems to reduce&#13;
operational costs and improve efficiency;&#13;
(c)   Improvements in maintenance management to minimize production&#13;
downtime and improve plant performance;&#13;
(d)   Introduction of performance linked wage and salary systems to&#13;
improve worker productivity and management performance;&#13;
(e)   Investment in the elimination of bottlenecks and replacement of critical&#13;
equipment and spares,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
(f)   Implementation of technical redesign and value engineering programs&#13;
to enhance product quality and meet international standards, e.g. ISO&#13;
9000; and&#13;
(g)   Assistance in the preparation of restructuring plans and export&#13;
marketing plans to enable enterprises diversify exports to hard&#13;
currency markets.&#13;
2.13            The most cost-effective and low-risk strategy for tackling these&#13;
problems would be to find foreign firms willing to enter into joint-venture agreements.&#13;
The prospective international bank to be recruited to manage the Bank financial lending&#13;
operations, will endeavor to attract joint venture partners from market economies to assist&#13;
enterprises in their modernization and restructuring efforts. However, as the supply of&#13;
potential partners is limited, Bank aims to support interested enterprises with technical&#13;
assistance from qualified international firms. Interventions to assist enterprises are&#13;
needed as there are serious gaps in the supply of market information and management&#13;
expertise. Until such time as private firms can find their own solutions, it is essential&#13;
to arrange for foreign consultants to fill these gaps. The financial situation of most&#13;
Kyrgyz enterprises would preclude them from hiring qualified consultants - thus the&#13;
proposed project supports the use of technical assistance needed by these enterprises at&#13;
least at the initial stages in addressing these problems (para. 5.8) In view of the urgency&#13;
to address these problems during project preparation, advanced funding from a Japanese&#13;
Government grant has been provided for diagnostic and pre-feasibility studies of about&#13;
30 enterprises, and for establishment of regional information centers.&#13;
2.14            A major impediment to the entry of entrepreneurs in new activities is&#13;
the lack of information on products, markets, and finance. The present situation is&#13;
characterized by an ad-hoc approach to investment decision-making often leading to&#13;
adverse results. In particular, small and medium scale entrepreneurs have virtually no&#13;
access to information about market economies in order to prepare business plans for&#13;
starting new economic activities. Under advanced funding from the Japanese grant,&#13;
$250,000 has been allocated to establish regional information centers in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic's seven oblasts to provide local business enterprises with access to information&#13;
on products, markets and other required data.&#13;
III. THE KYRGYZ FINANCIAL SECTOR&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
3.1          The Kyrgyz economy has hitherto been characterized by a dearth of&#13;
market-based financial institutions, instruments, commercial practices, markets and a&#13;
regulatory environment that are features of the financial system in a market economy.&#13;
The com mercial banks lack the infrastructure, skills and institutional capabilities required&#13;
for efficient financial intermediation and enterprise restructuring.  Moreover, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
commnercial banks continue to face an enterprise sector that continues to experience&#13;
difficulties. Non-performing loans, averaging 30 to 60 percent of total portfolio in&#13;
several commercial banks, are increasing as enterprise reform and restructuring progress,&#13;
hard budget constraints are imposed, and a rising number of enterprises fail to service&#13;
loans. Management, particularly in the large banks, remains poor, and credit skills are&#13;
lacking in most banks--thus there is a risk of continued poor lending. Considerable&#13;
institutional building and possibly restructuring and downsizing of existing commercial&#13;
banks are required before the banking sector can act as an efficient vehicle to channel&#13;
resources to private enterprises. Most importantly, financial sector reforms and reforms&#13;
of enterprises need to be integrated into a coherent strategy. The following is a summary&#13;
of the structure and performance of the financial system, and a review of the latest sector&#13;
policy developments and issues. More details on the characteristics and prospects of&#13;
Kyrgyz banks are provided in the project files and attached tables.&#13;
B. Institutional Structure&#13;
3.2          The Kyrgyz financial sector consists of the Central Bank (NBK), 19&#13;
commercial banks (including the former State Savings Bank), an insurance sector and the&#13;
State pension fund. The commercial banking system dominates the financial system as&#13;
a source of credit. In February 1992, the State Bank (GOSBANK) was replaced by the&#13;
NBK, when a two-tier banking system was established with the passage of the Law on&#13;
Banks and Banking Activities and the Law on the National Bank. The structure and&#13;
lending operations of the banking system are detailed in Table 3.1.&#13;
3.3          Fonner State Banks.   Three large former State banks, namely&#13;
Agroprombank, Kyrgyzstan Bank and Promstroy Bank, which have been corporatized,&#13;
dominate the commercial banking sector. Promstroy and Agroprom banks are virtually&#13;
bankrupt since July 1993, while AKB Kyrgyzstan has lately turned into a large loss-&#13;
maker, and faces difficult times ahead. Until recently the AKB Kyrgyzstan Bank&#13;
appeared to be the most promising and potentially viable of the above three, and is&#13;
among the three participating banks selected by EBRD to receive technical assistance&#13;
under its line of credit. It is estimated that these three banks account for over 80 percent&#13;
of the commercial loans outstanding and as such are major determinants of the solvency&#13;
of the banking system. The former State-owned savings bank, the Sberbank, which&#13;
previously enjoyed a monopoly on the collection of household deposits, has diversified&#13;
its activities to those of a full commercial bank. The Sberbank continues to be treated,&#13;
however, as a special case, exempt, for example, from the 20 percent reserve&#13;
requirement of other commercial banks. The privatization of forner State banks remains&#13;
questionable as their ownership is still dominated by State owned enterprises as detailed&#13;
in Table 3.1 and summarized below:&#13;
Agroprombank finances State agricultural production and food processing&#13;
enterprises, and consumer cooperatives engaged in food distribution. The bank&#13;
was converted to a joint stock enterprise in December 1991. Majority ownership&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
belongs to agro-processing related State enterprises and consumer cooperatives.&#13;
The bank has 51 branches and over 1,100 employees. It is the largest bank, in&#13;
terms of loans, and branch networks;&#13;
Kvrgvzstan Bank (AKB) finances primarily the agro-business and textiles sectors.&#13;
It was incorporated as a joint-stock bank in December 1991. Ownership is divided&#13;
between 45 percent private and 55 percent State commercial and manufacturing&#13;
enterprises. The bank has 25 branches and over 800 employees. It is the second&#13;
largest bank, in terms of loans;&#13;
Promstroy Bank specializes in the energy, mining and construction sectors.&#13;
Converted to a joint-stock enterprise in December 1991, it has 27 branches and&#13;
over 750 employees. More than 70 percent of the ownership belongs to State-&#13;
owned enterprises. In terms of loans portfolio, it is the third largest bank.&#13;
3.4         New Private Banks. In addition to the AKB Kyrgyzstan, EBRD has pre-&#13;
selected two banks among the most promising of the new breed of small and medium size&#13;
private banks, namely the Kurulush Bank and the Kyrgyz Vneshcom Banks. These&#13;
smaller banks are under the control of privatized, former SOE borrowing clients. Lately&#13;
the Kyrgyz Vneshcom bank has run into serious problem loans, stopped lending and&#13;
is now under special surveillance from NBK's supervision department which has&#13;
excluded it from all NBK windows, including the credit auction. NBK has directed that&#13;
Vneshcom (as well as the AKB Kyrgyzstan) be recapitalized by their private&#13;
shareholders, and put three other small private banks under the same surveillance regime.&#13;
Among the 10 small and medium banks still operating normally, only Kurulush, Henfen,&#13;
Orient, and Kramds banks (Table 3.2) offer a relatively comprehensive range of banking&#13;
services and have paid-up capital in excess of the new minimum establishment level for&#13;
local banks (KGS5 million-US$500,000 equivalent).2 Only 6 of these smaller banks have&#13;
one or more branches (Table 3.3). This group of smaller commercial banks, with a&#13;
stable financial base, enjoy progressive management and show some potential of&#13;
developing into relatively efficient financial intermediaries, provided, however, that they&#13;
receive adequate institutional building support, and improve the quality of their portfolio&#13;
and lending management. In agreement with the IDA, NBK has selected the German-&#13;
Kyrgyz Industrial Bank Orient (Orient Bank) which will be associated with the&#13;
international bank being recruited to manage a proposed Fund for Enterprise&#13;
Restructuring and Development (FERD) slated to intermediate IDA funds (paras. 6.4-&#13;
6.9). Details on the Orient Bank's ownership and structure are presented in Annex 1.&#13;
3.5         The Insurance Sector. The insurance service market in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic has witnessed significant growth, with more than 50 insurance companies being&#13;
established since 1991. The State Insurance Company continues to dominate the sector,&#13;
2 For joint venture and foreign banks the minimum capital is US$1.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
but is earmarked for privatization and is being broken up into smaller companies. The&#13;
other insurance companies are mainly small joint-stock companies with  mixed&#13;
ownership. Many of the new companies are on the verge of bankruptcy, largely as a&#13;
result of providing insurance coverage on bank loans. (Payments during 1993 on claims&#13;
under "credit" insurance were 136 percent of the premiums received.) Six of the&#13;
commercial banks and some State enterprises (such as the railways) established insurance&#13;
companies dedicated to their specific insurance requirements. In the area of "credit"&#13;
insurance, there appears to be some confusion between the notion of a guarantee and the&#13;
notion of insurance.&#13;
3.6         Pension Fund.  The Pension Fund is only marginally viable, with&#13;
payments often subject to delays as a result, for example, of individual enterprises&#13;
delay/inability to meet their required contribution to the scheme. In the short term,&#13;
issues relating to the Pension Fund are being addressed under the IDA Social Safety Net&#13;
Credit (Cr. 2643-KG) approved in June 1994. A package of reforms to the existing&#13;
pension scheme are envisaged in order to maintain its short-term viability and allow staff&#13;
of the Pension Fund to be re-deployed to administer the social assistance scheme. The&#13;
medium to long term issues will be addressed under an European Union project, which&#13;
will concentrate on policy, legislation, revenue collection and institutional strengthening.&#13;
3.7         Capital Markets. Technical assistance to develop capital markets is being&#13;
provided by USAID consultants. A legal and regulatory framework is already in place,&#13;
although it needs to be fine-tuned and strengthened. The USAID technical assistance&#13;
program includes four elements: (i) strengthening the State Agency on Securities and&#13;
improving the Securities Law; (ii) setting up a stock exchange and a voucher exchange&#13;
and elaborating the rules thereof; (iii) developing the associated institutions such as the&#13;
clearing system, and training brokers/dealers; and (iv) examining the question of&#13;
investment funds-the legal framework, operation, and training thereof. No other donor&#13;
involvement appears warranted at this stage for additional assistance for capital market&#13;
development.&#13;
C. Performance of Commercial Banks&#13;
3.8          Loan Portfolio. In general, the performance of the financial institutions&#13;
reflects the difficulties being experienced by the enterprise sector. These difficulties have&#13;
been compounded by the lending practices of some commercial banks, such as&#13;
preferential lending to shareholders/owners, which has led to poor allocation of credit,&#13;
and a subsequent increase in problem loans and narrower intermediation spreads. Their&#13;
sector-specific loan portfolio, with exposure to State enterprises, accumulation of arrears&#13;
between enterprises, loss of markets, and decreased sales revenues of borrowers, appear&#13;
to be the main causes of loan non-performance. The non-performing loans of these&#13;
banks are expected to be downsized to some extent under the PESAC Credit, by the&#13;
Enterprise Reform and Resolution Agency (ERRA). The outstanding debts of up to 29&#13;
large loss-making SOEs would be selectively repurchased through NBK, possibly at a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
discounted price by ERRA with PESAC counterpart funds. This "transfer" of part of the&#13;
debt of the larger banks, will not in itself be sufficient to assure a viable banking sector.3&#13;
3.9           The situation of the four aforementioned medium size banks (para. 3.4 and&#13;
Table 3.2) is far better than larger banks, even though 25 percent of their loan portfolio&#13;
is, on average, affected by non-performing loans. On average, their total free capital4&#13;
covers 31 percent of their loans outstanding, and amounted to KGs 22.9 million (US$2.3&#13;
million) at end 1994. The Orient bank, with KGs 11.2 million (US$1.1 million) in&#13;
capital, accounts for half of this capitalization, but the other banks are also planning to&#13;
increase their capital base significantly. Their deposit mobilization remains their weak&#13;
point however, with a total market share of 8 percent, accounted for mainly by Kurulush&#13;
and Kramds.&#13;
3.10           Financial Results and Position. The pre-1992 FSU accounting system&#13;
used by Kyrgyz banks does not follow generally acceptable international accounting&#13;
principles. Consequently the results and financial positions presented by commercial&#13;
banks are not reliable. Although banks portfolio are for the most part non performing,&#13;
they still declare profits and even distribute dividends. Preliminary reviews indicate,&#13;
however, that the majority of commercial banks are substantially undercapitalized, due&#13;
to erosion of their equity base from past high inflation, under provisionning of non-&#13;
performing loans, and high taxation of banks (e.g., 45 percent profit tax, compared to&#13;
35 percent for enterprises, non-deductibility of risk provisions, etc.). Significant bank&#13;
restructuring/downsizing may be necessary. Diagnostic studies of these banks would be&#13;
a first step in evaluating restructuring options, as only a diagnostic accounting and audit&#13;
of the three banks can establish clear evidence on the extent of liquidity problems facing&#13;
the major banks. This issue is being addressed by IDA under the Rehabilitation Credit&#13;
(Cr.2491-KG), by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)&#13;
under its line of credit and by a planned technical assistance from Asian Development&#13;
Bank (ADB).&#13;
D. Financing Enterprises&#13;
3.11          Access to working capital and investment finance for enterprises has&#13;
become difficult as State funding, which was the main source of funds, is unavailable in&#13;
any significant amount, owing to fiscal and new hard budget constraints imposed under&#13;
the PESAC and IMF programs. Banks have hitherto been largely dependent for their&#13;
3   If ERRA purchases the NBK-financed loans at less than 100 percentage of their value, banks would have to&#13;
provision or write off the remaining balance of loans outstanding. Depending on the discount offered based&#13;
on existing loan-loss provisions, for some banks, this operation could effectively wipe out their equity base&#13;
owing to insufficient loan-loss-reserves.&#13;
4   Free capital as defined under NBK regulations includes reserves and excludes loan-loss provisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
domestic resources on the NBKs whose refinance has also been curtailed accordingly&#13;
under new restrictive monetary and credit policies (para. 3.18). Table 3.3 presents the&#13;
results of credit auctions in 1994. It is estimated that total incremental lending by the&#13;
banking system amounted only to KGS 250 million (US$25 million) during 1994, mostly&#13;
by Agroprom, and a handful of small banks active in the credit auction market.&#13;
Although it is not possible to quantify, the informal market is probably by far the most&#13;
important source of credit for the private enterprise sector.&#13;
3.12         In 1995, a number of donor sponsored lines of long-term credit for private&#13;
enterprises are expected to come into effect in the Kyrgyz Republic, significantly&#13;
expanding the volume of credit available at present. Relevant donor programs include:&#13;
(a) a line of credit from Kreditanstalt Fur Weiderethrauf (KfW), amounting to DM10&#13;
million ($6 million) for agricultural and textile machinery and equipment, and DM5&#13;
million ($3 million) for micro enterprise development; (b) an ECU10 million ($11&#13;
million) line of credit for private small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from EBRD; (c)&#13;
$46 million available from the Central Asian-American Enterprise Fund (CAAEF) for&#13;
loan and equity financing, and technical assistance to private and SOEs in Central Asia.&#13;
When it becomes operational some time during 1995, USAID's CAAEF would make&#13;
available US$46 million to promote private sector development through loans, grants,&#13;
equity investments, feasibility studies, training, insurance and guarantees in the Central&#13;
Asian Republics of the former Soviet Union with priority given to Kazakhstan and the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. No details are yet available on CAAEF's operating procedures and&#13;
country allocation policies, but preliminary indications are that it would target high risk&#13;
investments in privatized enterprises as a financier of last resort. Details of relevant&#13;
donor projects are available in the Project File.&#13;
3.13         Demand for trade financing also exceeds supply.  Short-term  foreign&#13;
exchange credit necessary to finance imports is either unavailable from the formal&#13;
market, or available only intermittently, through foreign exchange auctions, conducted&#13;
by the NBK, with banks participating. Much of this foreign exchange is used in imports&#13;
of consumer goods. Supply of trade finance by banks is marginal, and when available,&#13;
costly (up to 50 percent for 3 months). Businesses rely on self-financing, advances&#13;
granted by some CIS exporters, to finance imported inputs, mostly in the form of barter&#13;
trade transactions, and costly underground sources of finance. Commercial banks lack&#13;
international banking experience, and cannot reliably utilize the requisite financial&#13;
instruments (e.g., bills of exchange, LCs,) and legal means for collateralization of&#13;
tradable goods and commercial contracts. Banks' main concerns reside in their inability&#13;
to control transportation of pledged goods to safe bonded warehouses, and the high cost&#13;
of pledge registration with the Arbitration Court which currently stands at least at 10&#13;
percent of the claim face value. Considerable institution building is required in the areas&#13;
of documentary credit, foreign exchange, international payments, and export processing&#13;
Close to 70 percent of loans outstanding from banks, as at October 1. 1993, were funded through resources&#13;
borrowed from the NBK through periodic credit auctions beginning in February 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
techniques. Some banks, like AKB Kyrgyzstan, have taken steps in reorganizing their&#13;
trade finance groups with assistance from foreign commercial banks. Other banks, such&#13;
as Agroprombank whose customers account for a large percentage of national exports,6&#13;
could advantageously use technical assistance in organizing for trade finance business.&#13;
IDA has addressed this weakness under the Rehabilitation Credit (Cr. 2491-KG), and&#13;
financed a comprehensive training program in foreign exchange and documentary credit&#13;
operations for 70 staff members of the commercial banks. Additional training is being&#13;
organized.&#13;
E. Market Structure&#13;
3.14         Interest Rates. A structure of liberalized interest rates has now developed&#13;
as rates charged by banks for loans and deposit are no longer regulated (Tables 3.4 and&#13;
3.5). The various financing windows available to banks from NBK allow them to select&#13;
market-driven reference rates from the Treasury bills auctions, Lombard facility, credit&#13;
and foreign exchange auctions. However, the volumes of transactions in these NBK&#13;
windows remain limited so far and do not yield reliable and lasting reference rates for&#13;
banks. Lending rates on 3-month KGS loans varied from 60 to 180 percent (indexed to&#13;
the auction rate) among better performing banks while US dollar loans carried 20 to 40&#13;
percent interest for short-term import finance. As the inflation rate, which on an&#13;
annualized basis reached as high as 1,000 percent in 1992 and 1993, has substantially&#13;
slowed down to about 1 percent per month in December 1994, interest rates have become&#13;
highly positive in real terms. Banks are keenly aware of the unsustainability of such&#13;
rates which are expected to continue declining in the coming months. Interest to be&#13;
charged on EBRD financed investment loans in foreign exchange will be freely set by&#13;
participating banks. Along with rates to be charged under the USAID Central Asia&#13;
Fund, interest rates on term loans for investment are expected to decline progressively,&#13;
and fall to levels averaging 15 to 18 percent a year, with borrowers assuming the foreign&#13;
exchange risk.&#13;
3.15         Competitiveness. The competitiveness of banks is undermined, to some&#13;
extent, by their ownership patterns and the residue of the command economy.&#13;
Competitiveness would be improved by reducing the ownership links between banks and&#13;
enterprises. NBK envisages to use selectively its arsenal of prudential regulations,&#13;
including minimum capital requirements and limits on insolvent lending to address this&#13;
issue. NBK would be aided in this regard by measures being implemented under PESAC&#13;
(para. 3.8). As many banks do not meet the new minimum capital requirement, and are&#13;
unlikely to be able to mobilize the necessary capital funds from insolvent clients, they&#13;
would be either encouraged to merge to satisfy NBK regulations, or be liquidated.&#13;
Initiatives in this regard will be balanced against minimizing barriers to entry. The fact&#13;
that more than 15 new commercial banks have been established within the last few years&#13;
6  Agroprombank estimates that their customers account for up to 60% of national exports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
indicates that there have been no significant barriers to entry. Indeed, the existence of&#13;
19 commercial banks in a country of 4.4 million people tends to suggest that the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic may be overbanked. For this reason the NBK intends to put priority on&#13;
encouraging mergers and consolidations among the smaller banks.&#13;
3.16        Resource Mobilization. Deposit mobilization by banks has been at a low&#13;
level due to a variety of reasons, including a low level of public confidence in holding&#13;
savings with the banks. Bank deposits as a percentage of GDP is estimated to have fallen&#13;
from 2.5 percent in January 1993, to less than 1 percent in October 1993. This low level&#13;
of public confidence in banks is traceable to concerns about the security of funds with&#13;
banks and access to deposited funds. Banking practices (as distinct from restrictions)&#13;
render access to funds in deposit accounts difficult. Such an environment dissuades the&#13;
public from placing their liquid funds with banks. Moreover, until recently interest rates&#13;
on deposits carried no incentives inasmuch as they were well below inflation rates. It&#13;
is only in recent times that interest rates on deposits have increased, ranging from 80&#13;
percent for short-term, to 140 percent for one-year deposit in KGS. Deposits in hard&#13;
currency yield 20 to 40 percent. Some banks are advertising for deposits. In an effort&#13;
to encourage savings mobilization the Government intends to introduce a Deposit&#13;
Insurance Scheme in 1995. NBK credit auction is available only against 50 percent T-&#13;
bill collateral, thus making the latter's rates closely linked to auction rates and further&#13;
limiting access to NBK resources. For term lending, banks will largely depend on&#13;
external resources.&#13;
3.17        Payments and Clearance. The slow and ineffective system of payments&#13;
and clearance exacerbates the liquidity problems of banks and enterprises. In May 1993,&#13;
the NBK introduced a new scheme of payments to reduce the settlement cycle. Under&#13;
a previous scheme, receiving banks had no incentive to promptly credit the account of&#13;
a payee as interest-free funds resulted from delayed credits to customer accounts. The&#13;
new scheme casts a responsibility to expedite credits to customer accounts on the banks,&#13;
without any reliance on the NBK. The payment arrangements have been decentralized&#13;
with banks, with the NBK settling net positions of banks through settlement accounts&#13;
based on the reports submitted by head offices of banks. The payment cycle can be&#13;
shortened into same date settlement through automation of payments. The NBK intends&#13;
to redesign the structure of the national payment systems as an extension of the new&#13;
scheme of payments and establish a clearing house. The long-term fundamental reform&#13;
of the payments system is being handled by Japanese Assistance, with the EBRD looking&#13;
at the short-term computerization of the existing payments system.&#13;
F. Monetary and Credit Policies&#13;
3.18        Foreign Exchange Regime. The monetary reforms leading to the creation&#13;
of the Kyrgyz Som (KGs) are a success. The KGS is fully convertible for both current&#13;
and capital transactions, and remains strong vis-a-vis neighboring currencies. It has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
appreciated by 20 percent in nominal terms vis-a-vis the US dollar between May and&#13;
September 1994, thus contributing to lowering the rate of price increases.&#13;
3.19         NBK determines the credit policy and influences liquidity in the banking&#13;
system through a variety of indirect instruments, including credit and foreign exchange&#13;
auctions, the Lombard facility, Treasury bill (T-bill) auctions and reserve requirements.&#13;
Increasing coordination is envisaged between credit auctions, bill auctions, and foreign&#13;
exchange auctions in order to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity in the banking&#13;
system. Substantial progress has been achieved by the National Bank, with the assistance&#13;
of the IMF, to adopt and implement market based monetary and credit policies.&#13;
G. Banking Supervision and Controls&#13;
3.20         Under IMF guidance NBK was reorganized in September, 1993, and a full&#13;
fledged Banking Supervision Department, responsible for developing related prudential&#13;
regulations and policies, established. Considerable progress has been made in designing&#13;
prudential standards in the area of capital adequacy, liquidity ratios, risk-concentration,&#13;
assets classification.  New regulations have been introduced.  The staff has been&#13;
increased and several staff members have been trained overseas. Improvements in&#13;
licensing procedures, prudential standards, off-site inspection are under way. NBK relies&#13;
on five prudential regulatory instruments including, maximum single exposure limits,&#13;
applicable to individual, or group borrowers or shareholders, and minimum shareholders&#13;
funds as a percentage of total assets. However, some of these ratios have been variedly&#13;
applied for Agroprombank, AKB Kyrgyzstan, and Promstroy Bank.&#13;
3.21         An expatriate advisor funded by the U.S. Agency for International&#13;
Development (USAID) has been in place to develop on-site examination and training&#13;
programs since early 1994. Work relating to design of new reporting norms has been&#13;
completed, coinciding with the introduction of revised prudential standards.  The&#13;
usefulness of the reporting forms will largely be determined by the consistency in&#13;
accounting systems adopted by banks and the NBK. At present, the accounts of banks&#13;
are not comparable. There is absence of an international basis of financial accounting&#13;
standards and practices. This issue of accounting infrastructure is being addressed by&#13;
Bank of France assistance to NBK. For commercial banks, EBRD, Asian Development&#13;
Bank (ADB), and IDA are reviewing the issue, and will propose an assistance program&#13;
after the ongoing studies.&#13;
3.22         The prudential regulatory framework and its effective enforcement are of&#13;
key importance as financial liberalization progresses. Such arrangements provide some&#13;
safeguards against the risks associated with freedom  in lending.  NBK is making&#13;
significant progress, and has closed three banks and put six others under close&#13;
surveillance, thus excluding these from its various windows, and asserting its&#13;
determination to rein in poorly performing banks. The framework will need to be&#13;
complemented by internal controls in the banks, external audits following international&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
and auditing standards and improvements in the Banking Law. A small and shallow&#13;
financial sector, as evidenced by Table 3.1, now exists. It is necessary to strengthen the&#13;
store of value function of money by appropriate policies. The NBK has established,&#13;
with speed, the rudiments of a framework for bank supervision, credit management. Its&#13;
key role in reducing risks in the financial sector will depend upon how quickly and&#13;
effectively several issues facing the financial sector are addressed in the context of a&#13;
coherent strategy for its development. Under a proposed Financial Sector Adjustment&#13;
Credit (FY96) IDA will be assisting the Government define and implement such a&#13;
strategy.&#13;
IV. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
A. Lessons of Experience&#13;
4.1          Experience shows that disbursement of financial intermediary lending&#13;
operations can be hampered by unstable macroeconomic environments, and the absence&#13;
of market determined, positive interest rate structures. Political pressure and interference&#13;
in the decision-making process, which contributes to volume lending by inexperienced&#13;
and financially unsound financial intermediaries, have also contributed to non&#13;
performance of Bank Group funded loans. These factors which are present in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic, have been taken into account in project institutional arrangements. Firstly,&#13;
substantial progress is being registered so far on the macroeconomic front with the&#13;
emerging of free positive real interest rates, and a stable, fully convertible local&#13;
currency. Secondly, the investment demand has been carefully assessed, and a detailed&#13;
pipeline of projects developed in close collaboration with enterprises (see Annex 4 for&#13;
details), and the lending component conservatively estimated at $12 million against an&#13;
estimated demand of $34 million. Thirdly, project preparation has focused on providing&#13;
early assistance to enterprises to prepare their business and investment plans. Finally the&#13;
institutional arrangements for implementation do not rely directly on the weak, banking&#13;
system, and minimize political interference by contracting with a qualified private&#13;
international banking institution, to be selected, to efficiently manage the lending and&#13;
technical assistance support. The selected institutions will train and incorporate at least&#13;
three professionals from the local counterpart bank in the implementing structures and&#13;
ensure a high degree of ownership and sustainability. Other donors and Bank are&#13;
actively providing technical assistance to strengthen banks to bring forth market&#13;
determined intermediation activities, and to reform the legal and regulatory framework&#13;
as well as governance of enterprises and banks, respectively.  Consequently, only&#13;
limited, complementary institutional assistance to the banks may be required under the&#13;
project to supplement other donors. Progress in these areas, and the effectiveness of&#13;
project institutional arrangements would be assessed during a proposed Mid-term review&#13;
of project implementation, and corrective action taken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
B. Bank Group's Past Lending and Strategy&#13;
4.2          The Bank Group strategy is to assist the KRG improve and implement its&#13;
policy reform and privatization program. In support of the reform program, a Kyrgyz&#13;
Rehabilitation Credit (Cr.2491-KG) was approved in FY93 to provide funds (a) to&#13;
finance critical imports and to help stabilize the economy; and (b) to assist in launching&#13;
the structural reform program with particular emphasis on privatization and financial&#13;
sector reforms (e.g., audit of banks and staff training). The policy-based PESAC&#13;
approved in FY94, is assisting the KRG to deepen the economic reform process, impose&#13;
hard budget constraints on the 29 largest loss-making State owned enterprises which&#13;
would be transferred to a resolution agency and their bank debts restructured (para. 3.9).&#13;
Under PESAC the quality and implementation of on-going privatization and private sector&#13;
development programs, are being actively improved and the price structure and control&#13;
systems are being dismantled (para. 2.4). The Social Safety Net (SSN) Credit approved&#13;
in FY95 is also designed to provide protection to the needy population and workers to&#13;
be laid off under the economic reform program and enterprise restructuring process. A&#13;
detailed review of the characteristics and issues posed by the social assets of SOEs is&#13;
underway under the Social Safety Net project. The SSN component for Divestiture of&#13;
Social Assets is expected to be implemented in two selected oblasts where large scale&#13;
SOEs are burdened with such assets. IFC is actively involved in the development of the&#13;
mining sector. IFC's Foreign Investment Advisory Services have reviewed the KRG's&#13;
investment promotion policies, with particular reference to the foreign investment and&#13;
private enterprise laws, and will follow up with additional policy advice.&#13;
4.3          The proposed Private Enterprise Support Project (PESP) would provide&#13;
financial and technical assistance to individual private enterprises to enable them to&#13;
implement business and investment plans and adjust their operations to the new economic&#13;
conditions. Technical assistance would also be provided to viable SOEs in advanced&#13;
stages of privatization, to complement the measures being supported under PESAC.&#13;
Technical assistance from foreign consultants with a wide range of specialized skills&#13;
would be made available to a large number of Kyrgyz enterprises to enable them to&#13;
restructure their operations and thus improve their competitiveness and viability.&#13;
Technical assistance would also aim to fill a serious information gap in the marketing and&#13;
technical areas and thus enable enterprise managers prepare realistic restructuring and&#13;
business plans (para. 5.9).&#13;
4.4      In the financial sector, in addition to strengthening the capacity of the&#13;
commercial banks to mobilize and efficiently allocate resources, new non-bank-financial&#13;
intermediaries will be required, such as insurance, leasing, factoring, venture capital&#13;
companies and the development of a capital market to support enterprise reforms. Most&#13;
of the assistance needs for developing these new institutions and their regulatory&#13;
framework, are either being provided or planned by USAID, EBRD, KfW, and ADB.&#13;
Under IDA's Rehabilitation Credit (No. 2491-KG) a detailed diagnostic study and audit&#13;
of Agroprom bank is underway. Against the backdrop of present institutional limitations,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
the requirements of private enterprises are immediate and cannot afford to wait until the&#13;
financial intermediation capabilities are available. Accordingly, an alternative&#13;
intermediation scheme has been devised in the proposed project for channeling resources&#13;
to the private sector for the short to medium term, until the financial institutions can&#13;
directly assume this role. Additional assistance to the financial sector will be provided&#13;
by IDA under the proposed FY96 Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (para. 3.22).&#13;
V. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Justification&#13;
5.1         The key objective of the proposed project is to provide an integrated&#13;
program of technical assistance and loans for working capital and investment for private&#13;
enterprises to promote their successful adaptation to a market based system. The&#13;
proposed project is designed to foster the development of the private sector economy&#13;
through: (i) the development of an effective system of providing technical assistance to&#13;
enterprises and credit to private enterprises; and (ii) strengthening of key project and&#13;
other selected financial institutions. With respect to the first, a specially created FERD&#13;
will provide a program of technical assistance and loans to finance investment and&#13;
incremental working capital in accordance with agreed business and restructuring plans.&#13;
Exceptionally, viable State owned enterprises in advanced stages of privatization, would&#13;
be eligible for technical assistance (para. 6.16). Under the second objective of the&#13;
project, funds would be allocated from the IDA Credit to contribute towards building a&#13;
reliable financial intermediation capacity in the country. A first step in strengthening the&#13;
financial capacity would be to develop restructuring and eventual privatization and&#13;
recapitalization plans for target financial institutions. The project will accordingly provide&#13;
technical assistance support to the National Bank and the Ministry of Finance to&#13;
undertake (a) diagnostic studies and in-depth auditing of the former State Savings bank;&#13;
and (b) a review of the regulatory environment, financial situation and prospects of the&#13;
insurance sector. A third objective is to assist the KRG in project implementation and&#13;
coordination through provision of consultant services and training of local Kyrgyz staff&#13;
in a proposed Project Administration Unit (PAU).&#13;
B. Detailed Project Description&#13;
5.2          The project would be supported by a proposed IDA Credit of SDR10.1&#13;
million (US$15 million equivalent) and a Japanese Government grant of US$2.5 million&#13;
to finance a package of technical and financial assistance to private enterprises and SOE's&#13;
slated for privatization. It comprises the following two components:&#13;
(a)   an investment lending component estimated at US$16.2 million. IDA&#13;
financing amounts to US$14.2 million, to be channelled through a Fund&#13;
for Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD) established by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
KRG to provide medium term foreign exchange loans to export oriented&#13;
and selected import-substituting projects of private enterprises; and&#13;
(b)   a technical assistance component estimated at US$3.9 million. IDA will&#13;
co-finance US$0.6 million and the Japan Grant US$2.5 million. The&#13;
technical assistance component includes (a) US$2,420,000 for management&#13;
of the FERD; (b) US$630,000 for private enterprise support; (c)&#13;
US$350,000 for financial sector studies; (d) US$350,000 for project co-&#13;
ordination, including consultant services and equipment of the PAU; and&#13;
(e) US$150,000 for audit of project accounts. An amount of US$200,000&#13;
from the IDA Credit is allocated for contingencies.&#13;
Lending Component&#13;
5.3          This component of $14.2 million will be on-lent by the FERD which&#13;
would be managed by a private Fund Manager (FM) associated with a local counterpart&#13;
bank (para. 6.5). The FERD would re-lend the proceeds of the IDA Credit and make&#13;
medium tern subloans to private enterprises for investment finance and incremental&#13;
working capital.&#13;
5.4          Participation of Local banks. At present local banks do not have access&#13;
to medium/long term resources and are thus unable to extend term finance. They also&#13;
do not have project appraisal skills. Local banks also do not currently meet IDA's&#13;
accreditation criteria, and consequently cannot participate as intermediaries in the&#13;
proposed project. The FERD will intermediate IDA funds and, in lieu of local banks,&#13;
lend directly to enterprises in order to immediately respond to the private sector's urgent&#13;
demand for financial resources. Such an approach will not, however, displace local bank&#13;
lending for investment, nor will it diminish their role under the project for the following&#13;
reasons. Firstly, a local bank will be closely associated in the management of the FERD,&#13;
subproject appraisal and screening activities by contributing staff, logistical support, and&#13;
possibly co-financing, and act as the counterpart to the FM. Secondly, EBRD and other&#13;
donors, such as KfW and the US AID CAAEF, will channel short and medium term&#13;
resources including equity and loan guarantees (from CAAEF) to the private sector&#13;
through local banks acting primarily as agents but also as risk-takers in a few cases.&#13;
(Local banks will be allowed to act as risk takers, only after the relevant donor has&#13;
provided extensive TA in the areas of credit appraisal, liquidity management, etc., to&#13;
strengthen the respective banks capacity). Thirdly, under the proposed project, local&#13;
banks will not only act as correspondent banks for the FM (e.g., opening letters of&#13;
credit), but are also expected to either provide local currency financing, or to restructure&#13;
the debts of certain enterprises financed by the FERD and other lenders. Fourthly, local&#13;
banks will be expected in the future to either purchase the loan portfolio of the FERD&#13;
or borrow from it for on-lending to their customers as, and when, they are in a position&#13;
to do so financially, and in agreement with the borrowing enterprises. In anticipation of&#13;
local banks becoming eligible as intermnediaries, the FERD will be structured as an Apex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
wholesale fund to provide refinancing resources to participating banks. Consequently,&#13;
there is hardly any risk that commercial bank lending would be displaced by the proposed&#13;
project's institutional arrangements, either now or in the future&#13;
5.5           Investment Demand. Most enterprises are operating at low capacity&#13;
utilization levels (average of 30%) because of the sharp drop in demand in the republics&#13;
of the FSU. This has led to severe financial distress in many firms who have little&#13;
inclination to invest in the present circumstances. However, a sizeable number of firms,&#13;
visited by IDA missions, have started to export to hard currency markets or are planning&#13;
to expand sales to neighboring Central Asian countries. These firms are planning&#13;
investments in machinery to improve products quality and cost competitiveness and need&#13;
medium term loans. Textiles, processed food, leather products, and a variety of&#13;
engineering goods including electronic items appear to have good sales prospects and can&#13;
be competitively manufactured. In addition, some medium to large projects in gold&#13;
mining and rare earths hold good potential for investment by foreign firms (Annex 5).&#13;
5.6           During project preparation close to 50 enterprises were visited and their&#13;
technical and financial assistance requirements reviewed in detail with their managers.&#13;
On this basis a pipeline consisting of 27 eligible projects, with a total estimated&#13;
investment amount of US$49 million, and total requested loan amount of US$34 million,&#13;
was developed. Included in the loan amount are working capital loan requests of US$5&#13;
million (detailed in Annex 4). The pipeline does not cover import-substituting industries'&#13;
which form the bulk of Kyrgyz manufacturing enterprises, and whose substantial demand&#13;
for investment and incremental working capital finance cannot be met by the banking&#13;
system. As interest rates have become positive in real terms, and the foreign exchange&#13;
regime fully liberalized, viable import-substituting enterprises will have access to foreign&#13;
exchange to service IDA financed subloans, and therefore, will be eligible for IDA&#13;
financing under the project. The subproject pipeline does not overlap with projects&#13;
identified so far by EBRD and KfW since they target different sizes of firms, and sectors&#13;
in the case of KfW. For example, EBRD does not exclude SOEs, while KfW is&#13;
targeting loans for replacement of agro-industrial machinery and spare-parts of German&#13;
built enterprises, and rural micro-enterprises. KfW has reviewed 181 loan applications&#13;
with a total project cost of US$92.3 million and loan requests of $68.4 million, as of end&#13;
July 1994, and expects to finance 4 to 5 projects a year. EBRD has identified 17&#13;
projects requiring US$20.4 million in financing. Additional investment projects are also&#13;
expected to be presented by privatized enterprises for IDA financing following diagnostic&#13;
and restructuring studies which will be initiated in March 1995, with advanced funding&#13;
from a Japanese Government grant.&#13;
7   At the time of appraisal in June 1994, import-substituting industries were not considered eligible for&#13;
financing due to prevailing high real negative interest rates and the unstable foreign exchange regime&#13;
stemming from high inflation rates in particular. The macro-economic situation has substantially&#13;
improved since then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
5.7          Sources of Investment Finance. Demand for hard currency funding by&#13;
Kyrgyz enterprises for investment projects and working capital is unlikely to be met in&#13;
the short or medium term by commercial banks due to their acute liquidity problems.&#13;
The banks' lack of adequate capital, and of project appraisal capacity constitute another&#13;
impediment to making term loans. While the introduction of foreign exchange auctions&#13;
represents an important step in creating a transparent mechanism for making foreign&#13;
exchange available on the basis of competitive bids, transaction volumes remain limited&#13;
in this market, due to NBK restrictions and insufficient resources in the market. This&#13;
in turn has led to high interest rates ranging from 20 percent to 40 percent for bank&#13;
short-term loans in foreign exchange. Informal foreign exchange markets provide&#13;
additional resources at very high cost to meet enterprise demand, and are likely to&#13;
continue until additional resources at reasonable prices are available. Demand for hard&#13;
currency is likely to be met mostly by donor lines of credit (paras. 3.12 and 3.16).&#13;
Technical Assistance Component&#13;
5.8          Technical Assistance for Enterprise Support. The nature of technical&#13;
assistance to be provided to private enterprises would include diagnostic studies of&#13;
individual firms, preparation of business and investment plans, and the provision of&#13;
technical, managerial, financial and other specialized consulting services to implement&#13;
individual business and investment plans. Preliminary screening of close to 50&#13;
beneficiary enterprises for the technical assistance support component was undertaken&#13;
during project appraisal. The technical assistance requirements of these 50 enterprises is&#13;
compiled and detailed in the Project File. The proposed approach to enterprise&#13;
restructuring and support was developed in close cooperation with local entrepreneurs,&#13;
and draft terms of reference and estimated costs are provided in Annex 2. Enterprises&#13;
will be assisted in three phases. Firstly under the Japanese Government grant, diagnostic&#13;
studies and investment pre-feasibility studies will be undertaken on a pre-selected sample&#13;
of 30 enterprises (mainly derived from the aforementioned pipelines) starting around May&#13;
1, 1995, and ending early July 1995. These diagnostics will provide the Fund Manager&#13;
with early input on the technical appraisals of subprojects. Secondly, upon selection of&#13;
the FERD manager its expatriate advisors will provide procurement assistance, and&#13;
undertake diagnostic studies with the assistance, when needed, of short term consultants&#13;
(para. 6.6). The estimated cost of short-term enterprise support amounts to $640,000&#13;
including US$100,000 for training and study tours of staff and management. Advanced&#13;
funding for preparation of the technical assistance component has been provided by (i)&#13;
a US$950,000 advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), and (ii) a&#13;
US$854,000 grant from the Rapid Response Technical Assistance Fund of the Japanese&#13;
Government, of which US$604,000 for enterprise diagnostic studies, and US$250,000&#13;
for establishment of regional information centers (para. 2.14).&#13;
5.9          Technical Assistance Cost Recovery. In order to ensure  beneficiary&#13;
enterprises' commitment to the technical assistance support, while taking into account&#13;
their financial constraints, cost recovery would be required but limited to a matching&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
grant basis. Technical assistance provided under the Japan grant will not be subject to&#13;
cost recovery by way of IDA financed subloans. Beneficiary enterprises will have the&#13;
option of including the reimbursable portion of the cost of TA as pre-operating expenses&#13;
to be refinanced under IDA financed subloans. Other enterprises not benefitting from&#13;
such subloans, would reimburse their share on the basis of a five-year, US$ denominated&#13;
advance from the FERD. The interest charge on such advances will be indexed to the&#13;
rate of 5-year (hereinafter medium term) US-Treasury Bonds plus a 2 percent margin&#13;
levied by the FERD. Free standing technical assistance subloans will be limited to a&#13;
maximum US$75,000 per enterprise, and their approval subject to IDA non-objection.&#13;
In order to ensure transparency and equity in determining a reasonable amount of cost&#13;
recovery, the FM's technical assistance team will make preliminary assessment of the&#13;
firms' ability to pay for the required proportion of the estimated TA cost, prior to&#13;
undertaking any technical assistance. The FM will determine the amount of reimbursable&#13;
cost, and enter into a grant agreement with beneficiary enterprises, as a condition of&#13;
technical assistance support. The FM will apply the following guidelines agreed during&#13;
negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
(i) -beneficiary enterprises will be expected to, at least, cover the local cost of&#13;
the intervening foreign consultants as estimated by the consulting firm;&#13;
(ii) -the grant will cover only the foreign exchange cost of the technical assistance&#13;
provided; and&#13;
(iii) -including the above local cost, beneficiary enterprises will reimburse the&#13;
following cumulative proportions of cost of consultant services, training and&#13;
study tours:&#13;
Up to $30,000-           30 percent&#13;
from $30,000 to $50,000   40 percent of amounts over $30,000&#13;
from $50,000 to $80,000   50 percent of amounts over $50,000&#13;
Over $80,000             100 percent&#13;
5.10        Technical Assistance for the Financial Sector. The financial sector&#13;
technical assistance program has been designed in close coordination with other donor&#13;
agencies providing technical assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic. In order to avoid&#13;
duplication and ensure a cost effective approach, IDA will complement other donor&#13;
assistance and on-going assistance under the Rehabilitation Credit (Cr. 2491-KG), (audit&#13;
of Agroprom Bank and training of bank staff). As agreed during negotiations, Japanese&#13;
grant funds are allocated to undertake (i) diagnostic audit of the Savings Bank&#13;
(US$200,000); (ii) a review of the legal and regulatory framework of insurance&#13;
institutions (US$100,000); and (iii) a trade finance study ($50,000). Additional studies&#13;
required during project implementation, would be financed under unallocated IDA funds&#13;
of US$200,000. Detailed terms of reference are available in Project Files. Detailed&#13;
costs of the technical assistance and other components are provided in Table 5.1.&#13;

5.12        Financing Plan. The IDA Credit of $15 million will be made to the&#13;
Kyrgyz Government which will on-lend US$14,180,000 to the FERD for re-lending for&#13;
subproject investment, and use $620,000 to co-finance the technical assistance&#13;
component. The $2.5 million Japanese grant will be used by GOSKOMINVEST to&#13;
partially cover the costs of FERD management, the Project Administration Unit, studies,&#13;
and training for a total of US$2.4 million; and as matching grant amounting to&#13;
US$600,000 for technical assistance to enterprises. Enterprises and local banks are&#13;
expected to co-finance investment subprojects and, due to limited resources contribute&#13;
about $1.0 million, each respectively, in local currency co-financing. The cost of the&#13;
FERD management to be supported by the Kyrgyz Orient Bank is estimated at $780,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
over four years. The detailed financing plan of the project is provided in Table 5.2, and&#13;

VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Administration Unit&#13;
6.1         A Project Administration Unit (PAU), consisting of two local professional&#13;
consultants, and a short term expatriate adviser, has been established in the State&#13;
Commission on Foreign Investment and Economic Assistance, GOSKOMINVEST, to&#13;
monitor execution of the management contract of the FERD, including strict adherence&#13;
to its operating procedures, and other agreed undertakings with IDA.  Other&#13;
GOSKOMINVEST responsibilities, to be undertaken through the PAU, also include&#13;
maintaining relationships and coordination between the World Bank Group and&#13;
Government on all administratively related project preparation and implementation&#13;
matters, and negotiating, on behalf of Government, all agreements. The PAU as the&#13;
representative of GOSKOMINVEST will contract with the FM for the execution of the&#13;
credit and enterprise technical assistance components of the proposed project. The PAU&#13;
will also have responsibility for ex-post reviews of sub-loans approved, and the right to&#13;
propose termination of the FM contract to Government and IDA, if it is not satisfied with&#13;
performance. The PAU will also liaise with IDA regarding implementation of the&#13;
technical assistance under the Japanese grant. Finally the PAU will also be responsible&#13;
for hiring and supervising consultants to be recruited to implement financial sector audits&#13;
and studies, in cooperation with Ministry of Finance and NBK. Terms of reference,&#13;
staffing, and budget of the PAU are detailed in Annex 3.&#13;
6.2         In order to ensure that the right caliber of staff is recruited for the PAU,&#13;
the PAU will recruit, and remunerate long term local consultants on the basis of World&#13;
Bank consultant selection procedures. The PAU operating and equipment budget is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
estimated at an amount of $350,000 detailed in Annex 3. The Japanese grant will co-&#13;
finance training under the PAU, and IDA other consultant services and office equipment&#13;
and vehicles. The audit of project accounts by internationally reputable firms is likely&#13;
to be costly and require significant foreign exchange funds. Consequently $150,000 is&#13;
allocated under the Credit to finance such audits to be undertaken by internationally&#13;
reputable independent auditing firms.&#13;
B. Implementation of Lending and Technical Assistance to Enterprises&#13;
6.3         IDA and the Kyrgyz Government have agreed to (i) create a Fund for&#13;
Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD) through which IDA funds will be&#13;
channelled, and (ii) to use the services of a private Fund Manager (FM) to manage the&#13;
FERD's lending investment operations, and provision of technical assistance support to&#13;
enterprises in an integrated structure.&#13;
6.4         Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development. The Government&#13;
has established a Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD) to channel&#13;
IDA funds. The FERD is a Government owned financial intermediary vehicle supervised&#13;
by a Board of Directors composed of the Chairman of NBK, the Minister of Finance,&#13;
and the Vice-Chairman and Director General of GOSKOMINVEST. The Board is&#13;
presided by the NBK Chairman. The FERD will provide term loans and matching grants&#13;
in foreign exchange for technical assistance to private enterprises. The FERD will have&#13;
a maximum life of ten years, or less if local banks can take over its functions before&#13;
then. FERD lending will be either direct and on a risk-taking basis, or indirect through&#13;
accredited participating banks assuming the commercial risk on enterprises. The FERD&#13;
will have no staff, minimum capital, physical assets or structure of its own. It is&#13;
materialized by its statutes, operating procedures and a simple bank account at the&#13;
National Bank. FERD operating procedures have been agreed during negotiations and&#13;
reflected in the Development Credit Agreement (more details on these procedures are in&#13;
the project files).&#13;
Enterprise Fund Management Arrangements&#13;
6.5         Definition of Management Assignment. The details of the management&#13;
assignment are provided in the draft Terms of Reference and attachments in Annex 2.&#13;
The expatriate team to be provided by the prospective international bank will include one&#13;
commercial banker with substantial experience in term financing of industrial projects,&#13;
as team leader, and two to three other professionals to manage the FERD and provide&#13;
technical and financial assistance to enterprises. The international bank will have full&#13;
responsibility, through its expatriate staff, for organizing an integrated structure&#13;
composed of a banking division and a technical division staffed by expatriates and local&#13;
staff from the counterpart bank. The technical division will operate as the technical&#13;
appraisal and supervision unit in charge of technical support to enterprises and&#13;
borrowers. The expatriate team leader will be the executive in charge of the whole&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
project. Furthermore, the expatriate staff will be twinned with counterpart professional&#13;
bankers to be assigned by the local counterpart bank. Training and integration of the&#13;
Kyrgyz Orient Bank, counterpart staff in project management activities will be the&#13;
responsibility of the international bank. Over time this local staff is expected to&#13;
progressively take over management responsibilities of the FERD, as and when agreed&#13;
by IDA and KRG. The international bank will also provide cost effective correspondent&#13;
banking services required for smooth project implementation (e.g., management of&#13;
Special Accounts, provision of documentary credit services and confirmation).&#13;
6.6          The core technical division team of the FM  will include a business&#13;
management specialist, and an engineering procurement advisor. They will be&#13;
supplemented as needed, by short-term consultants with specialized knowledge of specific&#13;
industries (e.g., textiles, plastics, etc.) to undertake diagnostic cum restructuring studies&#13;
of selected enterprises in that particular industrial branch, as well as assist enterprises in&#13;
preparing investment projects. Such consultants will be engaged for either a single&#13;
enterprise or a group of enterprises in the same industrial sector. Study tours and&#13;
training in critical areas such as export marketing, may also be financed.&#13;
6.7          Contract Form and Duration. The FERD management contract, will be&#13;
financed for an initial two years under the Japanese grant, and will contain clauses for&#13;
its renewal for another two years, if IDA and Government agree. If IDA determines that&#13;
a local bank satisfies the accreditation criteria, such a local bank might become the&#13;
FERD manager after the management agreement with the foreign bank expires. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached to ensure that (i) the arrangements for managing the&#13;
FERD will continue to be satisfactory to IDA; and (ii) in case the initial FERD&#13;
management agreement expires without renewal, no local bank satisfies the accreditation&#13;
criteria, and no new agreed FERD manager is contracted, IDA will have the right to&#13;
suspend the Credit (para. 8.1). In order to make an early determination with regard to&#13;
these issues, agreement was reached during negotiations on a detailed performance&#13;
evaluation of the project implementation arrangements.  Such evaluation will be&#13;
undertaken during a Mid-Term Review scheduled in March 1997, i.e., eighteen months&#13;
after effectiveness, and corrective action will be agreed and implemented at that time&#13;
(paras. 6.31 and 8.2 (iii)).&#13;
6.8          Remuneration. The consultant will be paid only fees to cover the costs&#13;
of assigning staff locally to manage the FERD's loan portfolio, and implementing the&#13;
technical assistance support to enterprises. Most of the local costs of the assignment will&#13;
be normally borne by the Government and the Kyrgyz Orient Bank which will provide&#13;
office logistics, equipment, counterpart professional and support staff, at an estimated&#13;
cost of US$780,000 over a four-year period (Table 5.1).  Signing of a FERD&#13;
management contract satisfactory to the Government and IDA, is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the Credit (para. 8.2 (i)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
6.9         Counterpart Bank. The Kyrgyz Orient Bank will enter into a cooperative&#13;
agreement with the Government by which the terms and conditions of its association with&#13;
the international bank will be determined, and incorporated in the FERD management&#13;
contract to be signed by the international bank. During negotiations the Government&#13;
submitted information on the financial situation and performance, and quality and&#13;
adequacy of the staffing and managerial capacity of the Orient Bank; as well as draft&#13;
cooperative proposals to be finalized in a manner satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
6.10        Approval of IDA sub-loans. A Loan Committee made up of the expatriate&#13;
managers of the FM, and including professional staff of the local counterpart bank, and&#13;
of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBK) as non-voting members, will be&#13;
appointed to review and approve FERD sub-loans and technical assistance grants to&#13;
enterprises financed under the IDA Credit. Loan Committee procedures will be based&#13;
on agreed FERD procedures and reflected in the FM management contract to be signed&#13;
with KRG. As NBK is the designated apex institution for the EBRD line of credit, its&#13;
participation will also help to coordinate co-financing of subprojects by EBRD and local&#13;
banks. Final review and approval by IDA of all sub-loans screened by the FM Loan&#13;
Committee will increase the probability that economically and financially viable&#13;
enterprises will be granted funding under IDA Credit. These understandings were&#13;
confirmed during negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
C. Amount and Allocation of IDA Credit&#13;
Terms and Conditions&#13;
6.11        The Government will enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the&#13;
FERD, represented by its Board, by which KRG will pass on to FERD US$14.2 million&#13;
under the credit component, and an initial US$40,000 for co-financing of the technical&#13;
assistance to enterprises. The subsidiary loan will be in US dollars, and interest charged&#13;
to the FERD will be equal to, and vary with the rate of 10-year (hereinafter long term)&#13;
US Treasury Bonds. Initially, FERD will lend directly to beneficiary enterprises, in US&#13;
dollars, and assume the commercial and financial risks until local banks are accredited&#13;
for refinancing of subloans to their private borrowers. IDA funds under the lending&#13;
component, will be available to FERD for commitment until June 30, 1999 (attachment&#13;
2 of Annex 2). The US$40,000 technical assistance funds (to be supplemental later on)&#13;
will be made available to selected private enterprises on a matching grant basis (para.&#13;
5.9). The balance of IDA funds will be used by KRG for other technical assistance&#13;
components.&#13;
6.12        Terms of sub-loans. KRG will assume the cross currency risks between&#13;
US dollar, and SDRs. Beneficiary sub-borrowers will assume (i) the foreign exchange&#13;
risk between the US dollar and the Kyrgyz Som, and (ii) pay market-determined interest&#13;
rates corresponding to rates for US dollar loans prevailing in the Kyrgyz banking sector&#13;
(para. 8.1). It is expected that such rates will be equivalent to, and competitive with,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
rates and conditions to be charged by EBRD's and the US-CAAEF's participating banks.&#13;
Such rates are expected to be below current high rates charged by local banks on foreign&#13;
exchange loans, and to average between 15 to 18 percent, with borrowers assuming the&#13;
foreign exchange risk between KGS and US dollars. While still high by international&#13;
standards, such rates do reflect local market conditions, including the perceived high&#13;
financial risks inherent in lending to enterprises in transition economies. The Government&#13;
will receive a variable interest corresponding to the rate of 10-year (hereinafter long&#13;
term) US Treasury Bonds. The FERD on-lending rates will be reviewed periodically and&#13;
modified by agreement between IDA and the Government, as necessary, to ensure that&#13;
they continue to reflect market rates for foreign exchange resources for borrowers (and&#13;
financial intermediaries).&#13;
6.13         The FERD will receive the IDA funds for a period of 15 years, including&#13;
five years of grace starting after the date of Credit effectiveness. The bulk of the&#13;
sub-loans are likely to have a life between 1 to 8 years, i.e., with sub-loan repayment&#13;
schedules generally shorter than the underlying repayments due from FERD to KRG.&#13;
Consequently, during IDA's ten-year grace periods, foreign exchange fund reflows to&#13;
FERD from sub-loan repayments, and technical assistance cost recoveries, will be&#13;
recycled, and relent under the same terms and conditions for the same purposes as the&#13;
original sub-loans. Maturities of sub-loans to final beneficiaries will be limited to a&#13;
maximum of eight years, including grace periods of six months to one year. Before the&#13;
end of this period the FERD is expected to have sold its portfolio to local banks and to&#13;
be phased out after reimbursing the Government. Signature of a Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement between the FERD and Government, reflecting these terms and&#13;
conditions, is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit (para. 8.2 (ii)).&#13;
6.14         Sub-loan Size. Sub-loans granted under the line of credit will normally&#13;
finance up to 80 percent of the total investment cost, including incremental working&#13;
capital, for expansion and modernization projects, and up to 70 percent for investment&#13;
in new enterprises. Sub-borrowers are expected to contribute in equity financing from&#13;
20 to 30 percent of project cost. Unless Bank otherwise agrees, the maximum size of&#13;
any sub-loan will be limited to US$1.0 million for all sub-projects to ensure a greater&#13;
number of credit beneficiaries. During negotiations the Government submitted to IDA,&#13;
draft models of a subloan contract, and of a technical assistance grant contract, to be&#13;
signed between the FM and its borrowers, reflecting the above terms and conditions.&#13;
Eligible Beneficiaries and Sub-projects&#13;
6.15         Only private enterprises involved in productive and extractive activities,&#13;
transport, trade and services which contribute to the economic development of Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic will be eligible for IDA financing. A private enterprise means an enterprise&#13;
whose capital is effectively controlled at least 51 percent by private investors, and its by-&#13;
laws and management structure consistent with private enterprise governance principles.&#13;
The FM shall satisfy itself, that the boards and management of beneficiary enterprises,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
operate the enterprise in accordance with private sector enterprise governance principles.&#13;
Land acquisition, real estate development and housing and office space construction, will&#13;
not be eligible for IDA financing. However, construction, and rehabilitation of industrial&#13;
and commercial buildings and sheds, related to an eligible investment project, will be&#13;
eligible for subloans, if they fit into the business plan. Incremental or permanent&#13;
working requirements will be eligible for term financing as part of a project investment&#13;
program, or on a free-standing basis. Unless the Bank and KRG otherwise agree, lending&#13;
for free-standing working capital requirements will be medium term, and limited to&#13;
US$200,000 per enterprise, and in aggregate to a total of US$4 million, i.e., 25 percent&#13;
of the Credit amount. As determined by diagnostic studies only viable private enterprises&#13;
suffering from (i) an imbalance in their financial structure; and (ii) under utilization of&#13;
their production capacities, will be eligible for financing of free-standing working capital&#13;
requests (para. 6.17 (e)). The above criteria were agreed during negotiations (para.&#13;
8.1).&#13;
6.16         State owned enterprises in advanced stages of privatization will be eligible&#13;
for technical support provided they agree to: (i) undergo a diagnostic study of their&#13;
management organization and operations; and (ii) implement a business, investment and&#13;
privatization plans, satisfactory to the FM. Once, privatized, such SOEs would become&#13;
eligible for subloans based on agreed business and investment plans (para. 8.1).&#13;
Sub-loan Review and Administration&#13;
6.17         The FM will undertake the review and approval of sub-loan requests in&#13;
accordance with FERD  Operating Procedures satisfactory to IDA.  Draft FERD&#13;
procedures are available in project files. These procedures have been agreed during&#13;
negotiations and reflected in the Credit Agreement between KRG and IDA, and the future&#13;
management contract to be signed between FM and KRG (para 8.1). These procedures&#13;
also reflect Bank Group procurement, disbursement and environmental protection&#13;
guidelines and procedures. The enterprise business and investment plan will constitute&#13;
the basic reference document for sub-loan reviews. For each eligible enterprise, unless&#13;
IDA and Government otherwise agree,&#13;
(a)   the business plan will be reviewed in detail and must be satisfactory;&#13;
(b)   the projected debt servicing capacity in foreign exchange (defined as the&#13;
ratio of cash-flow generated from operations to interest and principal&#13;
annual payments), will be no less than 1.2 over the life of the sub-project&#13;
and the debt to equity ratio be no more than 1.5:1.0, with the ratios&#13;
calculated on the basis of the enterprise's total debts, inclusive of those to&#13;
be incurred under the sub-project; and&#13;
(c)   satisfactory  environmental impact reviews will be undertaken  in&#13;
accordance with Kyrgyz Republic environmental guidelines and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
regulations, and as deemed necessary by the FM, and in some cases IDA.&#13;
Environmental guidelines under the project will be further developed in&#13;
coordination with the on-going Bank Group assistance to the Kyrgyz&#13;
Government to develop a National Environmental Action Plan, including&#13;
revision of environmental protection regulation and institutional capacity&#13;
for enforcement. (paras. 6.32 and 6.33);&#13;
(d)   a financial rate of return and an economic rate of return of at least 15&#13;
percent each will be required, as shall be determined and calculated by&#13;
FM on the basis of guidelines satisfactory to IDA; the economic return&#13;
calculation will be a simplified version based on a shadow pricing of key&#13;
tradable elements of the production cost (e.g., energy costs) and selling&#13;
prices, and will apply in particular to import-substituting enterprises; and&#13;
(e)   in addition to criteria (a) to (c), a restructured balance sheet depicting&#13;
improvedfinancial structure indicators (e.g., debt/equity, liquidity ratio,&#13;
etc.), and operating and financial performance indicators (e.g, stock and&#13;
assets turnover, profitability, cash-flow, etc.,), will be the primary criteria&#13;
applicable to assessment and justification for lending for free-standing&#13;
working capital. Viability of the enterprise will need to be established&#13;
unequivocally, in accordance with agreed FERD guidelines and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
6.18         Sub-loan processing under the project will be coordinated and centralized&#13;
by the FM, which will serve as the principal link between IDA, and the beneficiaries for&#13;
the project's lending and technical assistance components. Sub-projects will be prepared&#13;
by the beneficiaries with, if needed, assistance from the FM. The latter will review the&#13;
sub-projects in accordance with the agreed project appraisal and lending procedures&#13;
reflected in the FERD Operating Procedures.&#13;
6.19         The FM will review the business plan and appraisal reports to verify that&#13;
all eligibility and financing criteria and conditions are met. This appraisal review would&#13;
be carried out in the form of a simplified business plan for projects with an estimated&#13;
investment cost of US$200,000 or less (within 15 working days) and through a more&#13;
in-depth review for projects with a higher investment cost (within 30 working days).&#13;
These reviews will also focus on ensuring that sub-borrowers have undertaken&#13;
procurement consistent with agreed Bank Group guidelines (para. 6.20).  If the&#13;
sub-project is eligible for refinancing and satisfies the required technical, and financial&#13;
screening criteria, the FM will send the request to IDA for final approval. Upon&#13;
notification of such IDA approval, the FERD would authorize the borrower to present&#13;
the relevant disbursement documents for reimbursement of eligible expenditures or&#13;
opening of letters of credits for foreign suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
D. Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
6.20        Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with World Bank&#13;
procedures by borrowing enterprises with assistance from the engineering and&#13;
procurement advisor, during preparation of their investment plans as detailed in Annex&#13;
2. IDA has extended technical assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic Government to develop&#13;
and introduce the legal and institutional framework to manage public procurement, which&#13;
is expected to be completed before the end of FY96. This assistance program will help&#13;
to establish official procurement guidelines and procedures for public contracting. The&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) has not been prepared, but IDA plans&#13;
to initiate before the end of FY95, the preparation of a Country procurement strategy&#13;
paper (CPSP), in lieu of CPAR.&#13;
6.21        Procurement procedures under the project will be consistent with Bank's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines applicable to financial intermediary lending operations as&#13;
described below.&#13;
(i)   For equipment and materials to be procured for sub-projects financed by&#13;
IDA international shopping (IS) procedures will be required for individual&#13;
contracts of US$2,000,000 or below for each beneficiary, on the basis of at least&#13;
three quotations from qualified suppliers in at least two eligible countries, and for&#13;
an aggregate amount of US$12,000,000. For individual contracts, equipment,&#13;
materials, and works above US$2,000,000, international competitive bidding&#13;
(ICB) procedures, in accordance with Bank's Procurement Guidelines, will be&#13;
applicable, except for goods available from a limited number of qualified&#13;
suppliers, for which limited international bidding procedures (LIB) would be&#13;
used.&#13;
(ii)   Procurement of office  equipment, and vehicles under the technical&#13;
assistance component, valued at US$50,000 or more, will be made through&#13;
international shopping (IS) procedures in accordance with Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines, on the basis of comparison of at least three quotations from qualified&#13;
suppliers in at least two eligible countries. Individual items valued less than&#13;
US$50,000, will be procured through national shopping (NS) procedures, on the&#13;
basis of comparison of at least three price quotations from three qualified&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
(iii)  Works contracts for sub-projects would consist almost exclusively of&#13;
building renovations and repairs. Such works contracts are unlikely to interest&#13;
foreign contractors. Consequently works contracts valued below US$300,000 per&#13;
contract, will be awarded on the basis of national competitive bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures for an aggregate amount of US$3 million; and works contracts&#13;
estimated to cost US$300,000 or more per contract may be procured under&#13;
limited international bidding (LIB) procedures. Small value works contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
estimated at US$100,000 or less per contract, and not to exceed US$3,000,000&#13;
in the aggregate, will be procured through national shopping (NS) procedures,&#13;
under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of bids obtained from&#13;
three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The&#13;
invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic&#13;
specifications, the required  completion date, a basic form  of agreement&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and, where applicable, relevant drawings. The award shall&#13;
be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required&#13;
work, and who has the experience and resources to successfully complete the&#13;
contract.&#13;
6.22        The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Goods will be used for all&#13;
ICB procurement, and consultant contract forms for consulting assignments. Prior IDA&#13;
review is anticipated for the first two contracts for goods, the contracts for works through&#13;
LIB, financed by the FERD, and for all ICB procurements.&#13;
6.23        Technical Assistance Components. Selection of consultants financed by&#13;
IDA and the Japanese Government PHRD grant for US$520,000, and of US$2.5 million,&#13;
respectively, will be made in accordance with Bank's Guidelines on the Use of&#13;
Consultants. There are two contracts with firms, to be procured on the basis of short&#13;
lists, including the diagnostic audit of the Savings Bank for an estimated amount of&#13;
US$200,000, and the management contract for the FERD, estimated to cost&#13;
US$1,500,000. Contracts for consultant services valued at, or greater than US$100,000&#13;
for firms, US$50,000 and above for individuals, US$50,000 and above for training, and&#13;
single-source contracts will be subject to IDA's prior review and approval. All terms&#13;
of reference will also be subject to prior review by IDA. Other consulting contracts will&#13;
be subject to the IDA's ex-post review.&#13;
6.24        A general procurement notice will be issued after negotiations. Reporting&#13;
on procurement under the credit and enterprise support components shall be undertaken&#13;
by the FM, and under other components by the PAU which will also coordinate all such&#13;
reporting. A summary of procurement methods is given below (Table 6.1), and Anne-x&#13;
7 details procurement implementation activities.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
6.25        Disbursements. The proceeds of the proposed Credit will be disbursed as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    Credit Component. Under the investment component (i) 100 percent of&#13;
expenditures for up to 70 per-cent of total sub-project cost including&#13;
working capital for new operations; (ii) 100 percent of expenditures for&#13;
up to 80 percent of total cost of sub-projects including incremental&#13;
working capital for modernization and rehabilitation;&#13;
(b)    Technical assistance component (exclusive of tax) 100 percent of the cost&#13;
of consultants, 100 percent of foreign expenditures for goods directly&#13;
imported; 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) and 90 percent&#13;
of expenditures for locally procured goods and supplies.&#13;
6.26        The project disbursement schedule is based on assumptions in Attachment&#13;
2 of Annex 2, and the relevant disbursement profile for financial intermediary lending&#13;
projects in the ECA region, taking into account the particularly difficult project&#13;
implementation environment of a land locked country like Kyrgyz Republic in transition&#13;
to a market economy. It is expected that the investment component would be disbursed&#13;
in five years and the technical assistance component over four years, taking into account&#13;
expected improvement in capacities for project appraisal, financing approval, and&#13;
subproject implementation. Funds under the credit component would be available for&#13;
commitment until June 30, 1999. Disbursements would be completed by June 30, 2000,&#13;
the proposed closing date.&#13;
6.27        Special Accounts. To expedite disbursement of funds, two Special&#13;
Accounts A and B for the PAU and FM, respectively will be set up in a financial&#13;
institution acceptable to IDA. The authorized amounts of Special Accounts A and B are&#13;
US$200,000 and US$1 million, respectively. IDA will make initial estimated deposits&#13;
in Special Accounts A and B amounting to US$100,000, and US$500,000, respectively,&#13;
from the proposed Credit, immediately after effectiveness. These amounts reflect the&#13;
estimated requirements for consultant services for the PAU, and enterprise support&#13;
services, and for initial sub-project disbursements by the FM for a four-month period.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the special accounts will be submitted on a monthly&#13;
basis. The minimum amounts for application of disbursement will be US$50,000 under&#13;
the TA components, and US$100,000 under the credit component. Under the technical&#13;
assistance component, disbursements for expenditures for all contracts for goods and&#13;
services or individual items under US$50,000, will be made on the basis of statements&#13;
of expenditures; and under the credit component disbursements for expenditures for all&#13;
contracts or individual items under US$200,000, will be made on the basis of statements&#13;
of expenditures. This threshold under the credit component corresponds to limits set for&#13;
working capital finance (para. 6.15) and simplified appraisal procedures (para. 6.19),&#13;
and is intended to simplify procedures for, and further accelerate, disbursement of the&#13;
Credit. The documentation for justification of withdrawals made under statements of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
expenditures will be retained by GOSKOMINVEST for ten years and will be reviewed&#13;
by IDA supervision missions and audited annually. All other disbursements will be made&#13;
on the basis of fully documented applications.&#13;
E. Accounts and Auditing&#13;
6.28        The GOSKOMINVEST, through the PAU will have responsibility for&#13;
ensuring that the PAU and FM maintain appropriate accounts, and that those accounts,&#13;
including the Special Accounts A and B, and statements of expenditures, are audited&#13;
annually by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA.  The FM  is&#13;
responsible for maintaining proper accounts for itself and the FERD, and for ensuring&#13;
that such accounts, including the Special Account B and statements of expenditures, are&#13;
properly audited annually by independent, internationally qualified auditors acceptable&#13;
to IDA. The PAU and FM will furnish to IDA certified copies of the aforementioned&#13;
audited accounts, together with the corresponding management letters, within six months&#13;
of the end of the fiscal year. The PAU, and FM, will submit to IDA quarterly, and&#13;
annual, progress reports (including financial and budgetary accounts) on the technical&#13;
assistance and investment components, respectively. An amount of $150,000 has been&#13;
allocated under the Credit to finance the foreign exchange cost of the audit of project&#13;
accounts.&#13;
F. Project Implementation and Supervision Plans&#13;
IDA Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
6.29        Monitorable Targets. IDA's monitoring of project performance will be&#13;
based both on quantitative and qualitative criteria to measure progress in project&#13;
implementation, and achievement of development objectives, with particular reference&#13;
to the institutional arrangements under the lending component, and impact on enterprises&#13;
under the technical assistance component. Performance indicators applicable to normal&#13;
financial intermediary lending will not be used since no participation of banks is&#13;
envisaged. Quantitative criteria will include the following key indicators: (i) the number&#13;
of private and public enterprises undergoing diagnostic studies, and the number of&#13;
business and investment plans prepared and implemented; (ii) the nunber of enterprises&#13;
requesting funding from the FERD, (iii) the amounts of sub-loans committed and&#13;
disbursed by the FERD ; (iv) amounts of export generated by subprojects; and (v) degree&#13;
of local participation in project implementation, etc. The project implementation plan&#13;
and other quantitative and qualitative performance criteria such as compliance with&#13;
agreed covenants, are summarized in Annex 6.&#13;
6.30        IDA Supervision. Progress reports on the execution of the various&#13;
sub-components will be prepared and submitted quarterly to IDA and the PAU by the&#13;
FM (i.e., summary of activities, use of project funds, and progress of diagnostic studies&#13;
and restructuring of enterprises and banks, etc.). The PAU will submit quarterly and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
annual progress reports to IDA summarizing issues and progress in implementation.&#13;
Project supervision activities will focus first on the executing agencies (FM, and PAU),&#13;
and secondly on the financial performance of subprojects financed. IDA's supervision&#13;
plan is detailed in Annex 6.&#13;
6.31        Project Completion Report. A Project Completion Report (PCR), the&#13;
content and format of which to be agreed upon with IDA, will be submitted to IDA&#13;
within six months after the project closing date of June 30, 2,000. The PAU will&#13;
prepare this PCR.&#13;
6.32        GOSKOMINVEST has gained some experience and familiarity with IDA's&#13;
disbursement and procurement procedures as a result of assistance provided by the&#13;
project implementation unit of the IDA financed Rehabilitation Credit (Cr. 2491-KG),&#13;
and by the Crown Agents procurement consultants working in that unit. Nevertheless&#13;
Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and the FM managing team are not familiar with such IDA&#13;
procedures.   The engineering procurement advisor recruited under the FERD&#13;
management contract will assist sub-borrowers. Additional support from supervision&#13;
missions, and resident mission staff will also be provided. Particular emphasis will be&#13;
put on further and timely, training in procurement and disbursement, as well as&#13;
environmental safeguard procedures. In view of the lack of experience in investment&#13;
project financing, and the need to assist local banks to process disbursement&#13;
documentation, initial intensive supervision (14 staff weeks annually) will be required for&#13;
the lending component in the first year and a half after effectiveness. Subsequently the&#13;
FM should develop harmonious working relationships with local banks and function with&#13;
relative autonomy and less supervision.&#13;
Mid-Term Review of Implementation&#13;
6.33        A Mid-term  review of project progress and implementation will be&#13;
undertaken in order to test the effectiveness of project management, institutional&#13;
arrangements and implementation procedures and for a preliminary assessment of the&#13;
impact of many of the policy and institutional reform measures. This review will also&#13;
focus on impediments to the efficient operations of private enterprises so that the&#13;
technical assistance component may be revised if needed. Particular emphasis will be&#13;
put on reviewing progress in developing efficient financial intermediation activities and&#13;
accrediting local banks for refinancing activities under the investment component.&#13;
Performance under the FM management contract and progress in implementation of the&#13;
enterprise support component will also need to be assessed, and corrective measures&#13;
taken as required. The PAU will be responsible for the coordination of the Mid-Tern&#13;
Review, as well as of policy discussions and follow-up with other ministries and NBK.&#13;
The basic reference documents of such a review mission will be the FM management&#13;
contract, policy matrices under the PESAC operation, other agreed Credit and project&#13;
documents and audit reports of local banks. Following the Review, an agreed action&#13;
program would be defined, if necessary, for revision of project implementing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
arrangements, and enactment of additional institutional reform and strengthening&#13;
measures.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government to&#13;
undertake the joint IDA/KRG Mid-Term Review in March 1997. Recommended actions&#13;
agreed during the Review will be implemented in consultation with IDA (para. 8.2 (iii)).&#13;
G. Environmental Aspects&#13;
6.34        No major environmental issues are foreseen as most Kyrgyz manufacturing&#13;
and processing industries, with the exception of the mining sector, are generally&#13;
environmentally benign. The most serious light industry polluters are leather tanning,&#13;
meat processing and the dyeing operations of textile mills. But they, as all Kyrgyz&#13;
industries are subject to environmental regulations which are not always adequate or&#13;
effectively enforced. The Bank Group is providing assistance to revise and improve such&#13;
regulations. On the basis of the current sample of preselected privatized enterprises, no&#13;
environmental liabilities have been identified, firstly because of the relatively benign&#13;
nature of the enterprises involved, and secondly, because only a limited number of&#13;
outside investors are likely to be involved in this first operation. Nevertheless, particular&#13;
safeguards will be implemented as explained below.&#13;
6.35        The Bank Group is providing assistance to the KRG to develop a National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), including revision of environmental regulations and&#13;
development of the required institutional capacity for implementation of such regulations.&#13;
In accordance with IDA guidelines on financial intermediary loans and enterprise&#13;
restructuring projects, the proposed project would have a B environmental rating&#13;
applicable, whenever deemed necessary by the FM, to individual enterprises and projects&#13;
selected for IDA financing. Consequently project appraisal, procurement and supervision&#13;
procedures to be implemented by the FM under the lending component, will include&#13;
assessment of environmental risks and requirements for safeguards. A simplified manual&#13;
on Environmental Protection Procedures, will be used by the technical assistance support&#13;
firm and the FM in their diagnostic reviews and appraisal procedures based on the&#13;
following principles:&#13;
(a) Sub-Project Screening Categories. The three categories are defined below and&#13;
reflect increasing levels of potential impact (I =lowest, III =highest) on the&#13;
environment:&#13;
(i)    Category I. These are sub-projects whose environmental impact is&#13;
expected to be negligible and which require no environmental analysis.&#13;
The sub-projects may however require the incorporation of environmental&#13;
improvements in the project design through modification based on&#13;
recommendations proposed by relevant authorities.&#13;
(ii)   Categorv II. These are sub-projects which may include some of the&#13;
environmentally sensitive attributes referred to under Category III below&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
but on a much smaller scale with a localized area of impact. These&#13;
projects will require an environmental analysis specifying how the project&#13;
will meet national standards, and within these standards minimize any&#13;
negative environmental impact. These would also include projects in&#13;
which an analysis could identify significant positive environmental&#13;
improvements which could be achieved through small, inexpensive design&#13;
modifications.&#13;
(iii)   Category III. These are sub-projects which have one or more of the&#13;
following attributes; (i) impact on pollution discharges likely to cause air,&#13;
water, and/or soil degradation of sufficient magnitude to pose threats to&#13;
human health, national ecosystems or economic activities; (ii) extraction,&#13;
consumption, conversion/diversion or disturbance of substantial amounts&#13;
of a natural resources, e.g. forest, river, wet land, groundwater; (iii)&#13;
large-scale physical disturbance of site and/or surroundings; (iv) activities&#13;
located in or near sensitive or valuable ecosystems; and (v) hazardous&#13;
materials in more than incidental quantities, and hazardous working&#13;
conditions. A full environmental impact analysis would be required for&#13;
these projects.&#13;
(b)       Sub-Project Environmental Review - The technical assistance firm for&#13;
enterprise support will be responsible for environmental classification of&#13;
sub-projects, and ensuring that each sub-loan proposal includes an&#13;
evaluation of its environmental impact, if necessary, and clearance&#13;
documentation as required from the authorities. Initial environmental&#13;
assessments for sub-project applications would be an integral part of the&#13;
diagnostic studies of all enterprises (see terms of reference in attachment&#13;
3 to Annex 2). It would be the responsibility of the sub-borrower to&#13;
obtain clearance for a proposed sub-project from the national authority as,&#13;
and if, required by the Law. The FM will be responsible for monitoring&#13;
and ensuring that environmental remedies agreed under a sub-loan are&#13;
indeed carried out. In order to meet the guidelines requirements and to&#13;
handle the environmental aspects of loan portfolio development and review&#13;
the FM will need to have adequate expertise at their disposition. Bank&#13;
would undertake prior review of environmental aspects of selected&#13;
subprojects. Other subprojects would be reviewed on an ex-post basis as&#13;
part of project supervision.&#13;
VII. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
7.1         Benefits. The proposed project would support the Government's economic&#13;
reform and privatization programs, through efforts to help ensure the successful post-&#13;
privatization performance of former SOEs. Improvements in management efficiency,&#13;
productivity, marketing and profitability of privatized enterprises would also yield&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
tangible economic benefits for investors, workers, and the country as a whole. The&#13;
project would develop the institutional foundation for providing financing to projects with&#13;
high financial and economic returns and technical assistance to enterprises in developing&#13;
well formulated business plans. It would also contribute towards institutional reform and&#13;
capacity building in the financial sector, which will be supported further by a subsequent&#13;
financial sector loan.&#13;
7.2          Risks. There are three main risks associated with this project: (i) slow&#13;
implementation of new economic policy and legal and regulatory reforms for private&#13;
enterprise development; (ii) slow project implementation and Credit disbursement; and&#13;
(iii) political pressure, and opposition to required enterprise downsizing, product&#13;
diversification and quality enhancement. The first risk is expected to be mitigated under&#13;
the IDA Privatization and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC), approved in&#13;
June 1994, the three-year Policy Framework Paper (PFP) and the first year IMF&#13;
Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) approved in July 1994. The second and&#13;
third risks would be mitigated by management of the FERD by a reputable private&#13;
financial institution. Furthermore, only privatized enterprises with satisfactory corporate&#13;
governance structures and submitting sound business plans would be eligible for FERD&#13;
finance. The lending component has been conservatively sized at $14.2 million, and the&#13;
enterprise support component designed to accelerate project implementation by&#13;
enterprises. Progress towards this and other project objectives will be reviewed during&#13;
the proposed Mid-Term Review of project implementation and corrective actions agreed&#13;
and taken as needed.&#13;
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
8.1          During negotiations understandings and agreements were reached, inter&#13;
alia, on the following: (i) modalities for cost recovery of technical assistance to&#13;
enterprises (para. 5.9); (ii) assurances that management arrangements for the FERD&#13;
would continue to be satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.7); (iii) market-determined FERD&#13;
interest rates (para. 6.12); (iv) satisfactory operating and lending procedures of the&#13;
FERD, (paras. 6.10 and 6.17); (v) eligibility criteria (para. 6.15 and 6.16); (vi)&#13;
procurement arrangements (paras. 6.20-24); (vii) disbursement procedures (para. 6.25);&#13;
and (viii) special accounts (para. 6.27).&#13;
8.2          Other agreements and conditions agreed are as follows:&#13;
(a)    Conditions of Effectiveness&#13;
(i)    Recruitment of FERD  managing bank and signature of a&#13;
Management Contract between the Enterprise Fund Manager and&#13;
Government, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA (para.&#13;
6.8);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
(ii)   Signature of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between KRG and&#13;
Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development (para. 6.13);&#13;
(b)   Dated Covenant&#13;
(iii)  By March 31, 1997, implementation of the Mid-Term Review of&#13;
project execution (para. 6.33).&#13;
8.3        The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit in the&#13;
amount of SDR 10.1 million (US$15 million equivalent) at standard terms for 35 years,&#13;
including a 10-year grace period, to the Kyrgyz Republic for a Private Enterprise Support&#13;
Project.&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
MANAGEMENT OF A FUND FOR ENTERPRISE&#13;
RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.          The Kyrgyz Republic Government (KRG) intends, with the assistance of the&#13;
World Bank Group, to provide technical and financial assistance to private enterprises and viable&#13;
State owned enterprises (SOEs) in advanced stages of privatization. The objectives of the&#13;
Private Enterprise Support Project (PESP) are to assist such enterprises in making their post-&#13;
privatization transition to a market economy and to contribute to the country's economic growth&#13;
through job creation and through increased exports to non-FSU markets.&#13;
2.          Private enterprises participating in the project will be eligible to participate in&#13;
technical, managerial and financial diagnoses to be provided under the enterprise support&#13;
component of the project. The recommendations resulting from these diagnoses are to be&#13;
implemented by the enterprise management as a condition of eligibility for Bank financed&#13;
subloans from a proposed Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD) to be&#13;
established by KRG.&#13;
3.          In the current dearth of eligible and creditworthy financial intermediaries to&#13;
channel IDA funds, the Kyrgyz Republic Government (KRG) and IDA have agreed to create a&#13;
Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD) through which proceeds from an&#13;
IDA Credit will be channelled to finance private investment projects and technical assistance to&#13;
enterprises. The proposed FERD will be operated on the basis of a management contract to be&#13;
entered into between KRG and an international bank hereinafter referred to as the Fund Manager&#13;
(FM). The selected Fund Manager will manage a technical assistance program and operate the&#13;
FERD in accordance with standard banking practices, and with IDA procedures and guidelines&#13;
under financial intermediary lending and technical assistance operations. The FM  will be&#13;
structured and staffed by the international bank to be selected under these terms of reference.&#13;
4.          The International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group is&#13;
reviewing the feasibility of a Kyrgyz a venture capital fund in association with private investing&#13;
partners. Such a venture fund, when structured and operational, is expected to invest in, and&#13;
co-finance investment projects with the proposed, IDA financed Fund for Enterprise&#13;
Restructuring and Development. The FERD and venture capital fund would, in such an event,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 14&#13;
enter into cooperative financing arrangements and the procedures followed pursuant to these&#13;
terms of reference revised accordingly.&#13;
B. Objectives of the Assignments&#13;
5.           The proposed contract aims, inter alia, at the following objectives:&#13;
(i)    Provide technical assistance support to privatized enterprises for preparing&#13;
business plans and investment proposals to enable them to restructure their&#13;
operations, and successfully make the transition to the market economy;&#13;
(ii)   Provide viable loan and help mobilize equity resources for Kyrgyz private&#13;
enterprises during their post-privatization transition, and reorientation of&#13;
their activities, to market economies;&#13;
(iii)   Consistent with sound banking practices, follow a rigorous and transparent&#13;
process of selecting, appraising, approving, at a high quality level for&#13;
Bank financing, investment projects submitted by private entrepreneurs&#13;
and investors in the Kyrgyz Republic, based on acceptable business and&#13;
investment plans; disburse and supervise the loan portfolio in accordance&#13;
with prudential guidelines, maintain portfolio in sound condition and adopt&#13;
appropriate methods to deal with problem loans;&#13;
(iv)   Help attract local and foreign private lenders and investors in Kyrgyz&#13;
industrial projects and enterprises, by ensuring independent and&#13;
accountable decision-making for lending; the FM is thus expected to&#13;
actively promote local and foreign investments in the Kyrgyz Republic;&#13;
(v)   Develop an operations manual for the FERD, train on the job and impart&#13;
investment appraisal and banking techniques and skills to locally selected&#13;
qualified Kyrgyz staff, and contribute in establishing a self-sustaining&#13;
institutional capacity for technical assistance and investment; and&#13;
(iv)   Phase out progressively the lending and investment operations of the&#13;
FERD by sale of its loan portfolio to local commercial banks and financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
C. Description of Assignments&#13;
Functions of Banking Division&#13;
6.           The Contractor will undertake the appraisal and preliminary approval of sub-loan&#13;
requests in accordance with FERD Operating Procedures, a preliminary draft of which will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

provided separately. These procedures will be confirmed during negotiations of the IDA Credit&#13;
and reflected in the Credit Agreement between IDA and the KRG, and in the management&#13;
contract to be signed between FM and KRG, pursuant to these terms of reference. These&#13;
procedures will also reflect Bank Group procurement, disbursement and environmental&#13;
guidelines, and procedures. The appraisal procedures applicable to IDA financed subloans will&#13;
be simplified to the extent feasible in order to minimize the cost of project appraisal and loan&#13;
administration, and accelerate disbursement. The enterprise business plan and investment&#13;
feasibility studies would constitute the basic reference documents for sub-loan appraisals.&#13;
7.           The screening and processing of subloans under the project will be coordinated&#13;
and centralized by the FM, which will serve as the principal link between IDA and the&#13;
beneficiaries for the project's lending component. Sub-projects would be prepared by the&#13;
beneficiaries with, if needed, assistance from the Technical Assistance division (para. 9). The&#13;
FM would review the business plan and feasibility reports to verify that all eligibility and&#13;
financing criteria and conditions are met. This review would be consistent with World Bank&#13;
project appraisal procedures applicable to financial intermediary lending operations, and carried&#13;
out in the form  of a simplified business plan.  These appraisals will also ensure that&#13;
sub-borrowers have undertaken procurement arrangements consistent with agreed World Bank&#13;
Group guidelines. If the sub-project is eligible for financing and satisfies the required technical,&#13;
and financial screening criteria, the FM will either authorize the borrower to present the relevant&#13;
disbursement documents for reimbursement of eligible expenditures, or opening of letters of&#13;
credits for foreign suppliers.&#13;
8.           The FM shall establish an internal Loan Committee to review subprojects to be&#13;
sent for final approval to Bank. The Loan Committee shall be comprised of the chief executive&#13;
officer of the FM, and a representative from the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBK)&#13;
who would also participate in meetings of the FM loan committee as a non-voting member.&#13;
Functions of Technical Assistance Division&#13;
9.           The major activities to be performed by the Technical Assistance Division (TAD)&#13;
inter alia, would include:&#13;
a.    Training of local staff in various aspects of management and technical&#13;
consultancy for enterprises;&#13;
b.    Undertaking quick scan diagnostic studies of private enterprises to assess&#13;
their technical assistance needs and arranging follow-up consulting support&#13;
by short-term consultants;&#13;
c.    Supervising the work of short-term consultants and ensuring work meets&#13;
agreed performance standards;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

d.    Organizing training programs including study tours, and a series of local&#13;
seminars for enterprise management in critical areas such as export&#13;
marketing, international sourcing and procurement, financial management,&#13;
cost accounting,  managing in a barter environment, and inventory&#13;
management (such seminars to be conducted in Russian, with materials,&#13;
examples, and illustrations appropriate to the Kyrgyz business&#13;
enviromnent);&#13;
e.    Providing advisory services to enterprises on business plan preparation and&#13;
to address urgent problems in financial, production, procurement and&#13;
marketing areas;&#13;
f.    Assisting in the preparation of feasibility  studies/appraisal reports of&#13;
investment projects of viable private enterprises considered for financing&#13;
by the Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development (FERD);&#13;
g.    Assisting in monitoring the implementation of investment projects,&#13;
including procurement of goods and services of projects financed by the&#13;
FERD;&#13;
h.    Setting up computerized  accounting, management information  and&#13;
reporting systems; in particular, setting up jointly with the Banking&#13;
Division a computerized project appraisal system to facilitate the decision&#13;
making on all financing requests;&#13;
i.    Reporting  periodically  to IDA  and KRG  on technical assistance&#13;
operations;&#13;
j.    Drafting of an operations manual providing for procedures to be used in&#13;
screening of requests for technical assistance, including provision of&#13;
reimbursable grants and cost recovery and/or financing and evaluation of&#13;
enterprises; and&#13;
k.    Developing a list of prospective technical, marketing, and investment&#13;
foreign partners for industries active in the KR, or liaising with an&#13;
organization that has developed, and maintaining such a list.&#13;
10.          The core technical assistance team of the FM would be supplemented by short-&#13;
term consultants with specialized knowledge of specific industries (e.g., textiles, plastics, etc.)&#13;
who would undertake diagnostic cum restructuring studies of selected enterprises in that&#13;
particular industrial branch. The result of this consulting effort should be a detailed investment&#13;
proposal for the enterprise studied in conformance with the financing requirements for FERD&#13;
loans. Generic terms of reference for consultants to undertake such diagnostic cum restructuring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
studies are provided in Attachment 3. All enterprises are likely to need additional technical&#13;
assistance in implementing their business plans and introducing improvements in management&#13;
systems and procedures. Enterprises which are receiving financial assistance from the FERD&#13;
are expected to finance the costs of this technical assistance as part of their project costs.&#13;
However, some follow-up technical assistance, particularly training in critical areas such as&#13;
export marketing, may be financed by the TAD. Such consultants will be engaged for either&#13;
a single enterprise or a group of enterprises in the same industrial sector.&#13;
D. Implementation of the Assigmnents&#13;
11.         Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development. IDA Credit will be made&#13;
to the Government which will legally establish a Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and&#13;
Development (FERD) to channel the lending and technical assistance components of the PESP&#13;
project. The FERD will have no staff, capital or physical assets or structure of its own. It&#13;
would open, and be operated through a simple bank account either at the National Bank of the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic (NBK) or any other financial institution acceptable to KRG and Bank.&#13;
Management of the FERD's day-to-day operations, including supervision of projects financed&#13;
and "lnder construction, and of its portfolio of loans, would be contracted out to the Fund&#13;
Manager. The FERD would lend directly, and assume the commercial lending risks. The FERD&#13;
portfolio of loans would be progressively sold and transferred to local banks and financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
12.               Government Contribution. The Government counterpart agency for the&#13;
project is the State Committee on Foreign Investments and Economic Assistance&#13;
(GOSKOMINVEST) which will negotiate and sign, on behalf of the Government, the&#13;
management contract between the FERD and the consultant. Goskominvest will also negotiate&#13;
with the consultant the provision of logistical and other support, through the German-Kyrgyz&#13;
Industrial Bank Orient, a counterpart local commercial bank selected by the Government to&#13;
provide logistical support to the managing international bank, including local professional and&#13;
support staff, office space and equipment. Liaison with GOSKOMINVEST will be through a&#13;
Project Administration Unit (PAU)&#13;
E. Output and Remuneration&#13;
13.         The proposed IDA Credit of $15 million will be allocated to finance FERD&#13;
subloans. It is expected that FERD subloans would be committed and disbursed over a five-year&#13;
period after Credit effectiveness as shown in the projections in Attachment 2. The FM will&#13;
prepare quarterly and annual reports on the FERD lending and technical assistance activities as&#13;
detailed in the Operating Procedures and the Credit Agreement between IDA and the KRG. An&#13;
audit report on the FERD operations and financial results, will also be undertaken by&#13;
independent qualified auditors acceptable to IDA, and the KRG which will finance such audits.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
14.         The consultant will be paid an agreed fee to cover the costs of assigning expatriate&#13;
staff to manage the FERD's loan portfolio, and implement the technical assistance support to&#13;
enterprises. A preliminary, indicative performance evaluation system, based on the quality of&#13;
the loan portfolio outstanding at the end of the second year after effectiveness of the management&#13;
contract has been developed as shown in Attachment 1. Such a performance evaluation will be&#13;
applicable only if the contract of the FM is renewed for an additional two years. Under this&#13;
system a bonus would be paid to the FM. This bonus will be in the form of a margin to be paid&#13;
out of interest income, and other commissions and fees on subloans, effectively collected by the&#13;
FM, on behalf of the FERD, subject to agreed lending targets detailed in Attachment 2 to the&#13;
terms of reference. The consultant would also be paid a commission on all successful sale and&#13;
transfer of FERD subloans to private banks and investors on the basis of practices prevalent in&#13;
capital and financial markets. More details on the indicative fee indexation procedure and&#13;
targets are provided in Attachment I to the Terms of Reference.&#13;
F. Qualifications of Bidders&#13;
15.         The contractor must be a qualified, investment development or commercial bank,&#13;
experienced in financial risk-taking and management, including the technical, financial and&#13;
economic appraisal of investment projects, the processing, approval, disbursement and&#13;
administration of a portfolio of loans and equity investments in developing countries and/or&#13;
transition economies. The contractor will provide the necessary international management team,&#13;
and hire the local Kyrgyz professional staff. Special consideration will be given to bidders who&#13;
will provide cost effective correspondent banking services and staff training facilities, necessary&#13;
for overall project implementation (.e.g., for management of special accounts in foreign&#13;
currencies, provision of documentary credit and letters of credit confirmation for importation&#13;
of IDA financed goods and services.&#13;

MANAGEMENT OF AN ENTERPRISE SUPPORT FUND&#13;
Attachment 1:        Proposed Performance Evaluation System'&#13;
1.          Incentives need to be provided to the Fund managers so that the overall objectives&#13;
of the credit line are efficiently achieved and consistent with prudent banking practices. The&#13;
major objectives are: provision of financial support to viable projects based on careful appraisal&#13;
and in line with projected targets; timely recovery of funds due; and minimization of operating&#13;
costs. The following performance measures are proposed.&#13;
1) Collection ratio for interest due (%)&#13;
2) Collection ratio for principal due (%)&#13;
3) Actual level of operating cost to projected level (%)&#13;
2.          The procedure for using the performance measures initially calls for establishing&#13;
a range of values for each indicator for various levels of performance. Under a five point scale&#13;
established for measuring performance, each indicator value can be assigned a score on the&#13;
scale. A score is thus assigned to each indicator which is then consolidated to derive a single&#13;
numerical scope through weights assigned to each indicator to reflect their relative importance.&#13;
A detailed description of the performance evaluation system is provided below.&#13;
3.          For the indicators chosen, the following is an example of the evaluation system&#13;
using a five point scale, with a maximum score of 4 for excellent performance and zero for poor&#13;
performance.&#13;
Performance     Excellent   Good   Satisfactory   Unsatisfactory    Poor   Weight&#13;
Indicator          (4)       (3)        (2)           (1)         (0)&#13;
Interest&#13;
Collection        98%       93%        90%           84%          80%      0.25&#13;
Principal&#13;
Collection        95%       92%        89%           86%          83%      0.50&#13;
Operating Cost&#13;
Performance       90%       95%        100%          105%        110%      0.25&#13;
Applicable only during Phase 2 of the assignment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -                      Annex 2&#13;
Page 8 of 14&#13;
4.          Actual performance would be assigned a score from 4 to 0 based on the above&#13;
agreed scales of performance and consolidated to one numerical value. The incentive system&#13;
would be linked to the overall performance score. Thus, for excellent performance, a bonus of&#13;
4 weeks salary would be given to Managers which would be progressively reduced to zero for&#13;
poor performance. The actual indicator levels and weights would be negotiated with the&#13;
successful bidder during contract negotiation.&#13;
5.          The FERD is an interim channel of intermediation to be phased out as local banks&#13;
improve their processing capacity and credit worthiness. Consequently, the loan portfolio of the&#13;
FERD is to be sold to such banks, and eventually to any financial institution. The manager will&#13;
be paid a fee on each sale, to be determined.&#13;

MANAGEMENT OF A FUND FOR ENTERPRISE&#13;
RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Attachment 2:   Estimated Subloan Commitments and Disbursements&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
1.          Under a Japanese grant, a consulting firm has already been commissioned to&#13;
undertake detailed diagnostic and pre-feasibility studies for close to 30 private enterprises. These&#13;
diagnostic studies are expected to start in April 1995 and be substantially completed by July 30,&#13;
1995. The prospective Fund Manager would consequently dispose of a sizeable number of pre-&#13;
appraised investment projects based on business and investment plans of diagnosed enterprises.&#13;
Based on such plans the FM should be able to accelerate their own, more detailed economic and&#13;
financial appraisal of investment proposals, including preparation of procurement and&#13;
disbursement arrangements for pre-identified, discrete pieces of production equipment working&#13;
capital stocks to be financed. Moreover, since import-substituting enterprises would also be&#13;
eligible for financing under the IDA Credit, the pipeline of projects originally identified to&#13;
include some US$ 34 million in prospective investments for export-oriented projects, will&#13;
substantially increase.&#13;
2.          Subloans to be financed under the credit component of US$12 million are assumed&#13;
to be approved, committed and disbursed as follows (US$1,000):&#13;

MANAGEMENT OF A FUND FOR ENTERPRISE&#13;
RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Attachment 3:     Short Term Enterprise Diagnostics and Support&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          The Kyrgyz Republic Government (KRG) intends, with the assistance of the&#13;
World Bank and other international financial institutions, to provide technical and financial&#13;
assistance to privatized enterprises and viable State owned enterprises to be privatized in the near&#13;
future. The objectives of this program are to assist enterprises in their transition to a market&#13;
economy and contribute to the country's economic growth through job creation and through&#13;
increased exports to non-FSU markets.&#13;
2.          Privatized enterprises participating in the program will undergo a prerequisite&#13;
quick scan exercise. The recommendations resulting from this exercise will be presented to the&#13;
management of the enterprise and a joint decision with the consulting team will be made of&#13;
subsequent actions. Enterprises agreeing to implement prescribed recommendations, may benefit&#13;
from additional financial assistance such as short term credits for working capital, pre-shipment&#13;
export financing activities, and medium/long term credits provided by the Fund for Enterprise&#13;
Restructuring and Development to be established by the International Development Association&#13;
(IDA).&#13;
3.          The quick scan of an enterprise would  determine whether more intensive&#13;
assistance to the enterprise is justified or not. This can be accomplished by the team in one or&#13;
two days. Where further assistance is not warranted, e.g., because the enterprise is not viable,&#13;
and should be liquidated, a brief report would be prepared. If the enterprise is deemed to merit&#13;
further assistance, the full range of comprehensive technical assistance detailed in the TORs&#13;
should be given. It is expected that about 80 enterprises would be covered by the quick scan,&#13;
and about thirty to forty enterprises provided the in-depth assistance.&#13;
Methodology of Enterprise Restructuring&#13;
4.          The enterprise restructuring work will be carried out in two phases. The first&#13;
phase will be a diagnostic study, analyzing the viability of the enterprise based on a review of&#13;
all aspects of the enterprise--economic, financial ,management, and technical. The consultant&#13;
will prepare a short report on the diagnostic work, present and review the findings with both&#13;
enterprise management. Only after agreement has been reached with enterprise management on&#13;
the key issues and approaches to resolve them, that the second phase of the study will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 54 -                 Annex 2&#13;
Page 13 of 14&#13;
initiated. The diagnostic phase report should include recommendations on a set of urgent actions&#13;
that could be implemented by the enterprise management largely on their own: to improve&#13;
production levels, reduce costs, improve quality, increase sales and improve financial&#13;
management. In this context, the consultant should provide information to the management,&#13;
where ever feasible and appropriate, on ways to deal with urgent and critical problems affecting&#13;
enterprise performance.&#13;
5.          The diagnostic exercise will be expected to also evaluate the long term economic&#13;
and financial viability of the enterprise and advise whether further assistance for restructuring&#13;
is justified. The diagnosis will determine the enterprise's domestic and international&#13;
competitiveness through analysis of its production costs, product quality, management&#13;
capabilities and its sales and marketing strengths and organization with specific reference to&#13;
export activities. The diagnostic study and reports should be completed in one calendar week&#13;
for a typical enterprise. Typically one engineer and one business analyst would undertake the&#13;
diagnostic assessment.&#13;
6.          The second phase of the restructuring work involves preparation of a medium term&#13;
business plan as well as feasibility studies for proposed capital investments required to support&#13;
the business plan. The feasibility study should roughly demonstrate the financial and economic&#13;
merit of the proposed investment. This phase should be completed in one calendar week by a&#13;
two person team for a typical enterprise. The consulting input estimated for both phases is about&#13;
four person weeks; a small enterprise may require less, a complex one, somewhat more.&#13;
7.          The business plan should include a financial plan with 3 to 5 year projections of&#13;
key operational parameters as well as standard financial statements to demonstrate the viability&#13;
and sustainability of the plan. All assumptions should be clearly identified. The business plan&#13;
should bring out the key risks facing the enterprise in implementing the plan and the necessary&#13;
actions needed to reduce the risks. The business plan will be reviewed periodically with the&#13;
FERD and modified as needed in light of actual performance.&#13;
8.          In preparing the business plan, the consultant should examine improvements&#13;
needed in the organization and management structure, management systems, and procedures.&#13;
These could involve actions such as reorganization of the organization structure in the form of&#13;
profit centers, elimination of non-viable divisions, redesign of product mix and marketing&#13;
strategies, design and installation of management information systems in all functional areas,&#13;
design of management training programs, strengthening of logistics management, production&#13;
management and inventory control, and introduction of modem financial planning and control&#13;
practices. The consultant would be expected to exercise judgment in focusing on the important&#13;
issues and not necessarily cover all issues in depth. This task should include preparing a&#13;
timetable and rough cost estimate as well as the terms of reference for consultants to implement&#13;
the recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                       Annex 2&#13;
Page 14 of 14&#13;
9.          The main thrust of the business plan will be to articulate a coherent strategy to&#13;
enable the enterprise to diversify its exports to market economies. The business plan should&#13;
include the following topics:&#13;
a.    Product-market strategy:  Product market strategy is the key element of the&#13;
business plan. The strategy should include the following elements: definition of&#13;
target markets and analysis of customers; projected market share; promotion and&#13;
advertising strategies; pricing policies; distribution and customer service and&#13;
needed product design changes. The consultant should provide comprehensive&#13;
data on target markets which would be the basis for the market strategy.&#13;
b.    Research and development and technology enhancement needs: The research and&#13;
development strategy should examine, in particular, what technological inputs are&#13;
needed by the company to upgrade product designs and quality or introduce new&#13;
products. Sources of technical assistance should be identified.&#13;
c.    Management training and human resource development: Management training and&#13;
other forms of training needs, e.g., export marketing should be identified.&#13;
Estimated costs of such training should be budgeted in the financial plans; and,&#13;
d.    Investment plan to complement the product-market strategy: The investment plan&#13;
should spell out the physical investments required to implement the business plan.&#13;
The feasibility of all investments should be demonstrated on the basis of sound&#13;
appraisal procedures and include a comprehensive analysis of the technical,&#13;
economic, market, and financial aspects of the project. Financial/simplified&#13;
economic rates of return should be calculated with sensitivity analysis of key&#13;
variables.&#13;
10.         The investment plan should be based, if appropriate on two scenarios: the first&#13;
would be a minimum investment strategy involving addition of spares and critical equipment&#13;
only. The second scenario may provide for additional investment to manufacture new products,&#13;
enlarge capacity or replace obsolete equipment. The consultant should, however, note that the&#13;
overall investment strategy in transitional economics should be to minimize physical investments&#13;
and defer them to a later period until the market signals are clearer and management of the&#13;
enterprise has had a chance to prove itself.&#13;
11.         The consultant will assist the enterprise, if needed in presenting the business plan&#13;
and investment plan to the Fund for Enterprise Restructuring and Development and clarifying&#13;
any issues raised.&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
INVESTMENT PIPELINE&#13;
1.          A private sector is slowly emerging in the Kyrgyz Republic. Its evolution&#13;
has been based on a combination of (i) the recent relaxation in Government regulations&#13;
over the activities of both public and private enterprises, (ii) the progress made in&#13;
privatization (by June, 1994, approximately 4,800 enterprises or roughly 40% of the&#13;
State's assets had been privatized) and (iii) an increase in entrepreneurial activities.&#13;
2.          Thus, even though the transformation from a centrally planned to a market&#13;
economy is proving difficult in the Kyrgyz Republic (as it is in all of the CIS countries)&#13;
and most enterprises in both the private and public sector are operating at low capacity&#13;
utilization levels, (on average 40%), there are certain enterprises which have taken a great&#13;
deal of initiative and are actually making the necessary adjustments to become&#13;
competitive. An issue critical to determining their ability to succeed in this transition,&#13;
however, will be their ability to access capital. And at present, virtually all Kyrgyz&#13;
enterprises are unable to satisfy their demand for either working capital or medium to&#13;
long term credit.&#13;
3.          A number of enterprises which had foreign markets before are working to&#13;
maximize sales to these markets by adding new or widening existing production lines or&#13;
improving their production quality. Other enterprises which had previously sold primarily&#13;
in the domestic market before, are exploring the possibility of exporting to new markets&#13;
with either new products or an improved version of an existing line. At other enterprises,&#13;
management is focused on meeting domestic demand - this is the case particularly in food&#13;
processing and cenain textile enterprises. In all cases, however, there is a demand for&#13;
hard currency and nearly every enterprise understands the benefits of establishing a means&#13;
to transform its production into hard currency.&#13;
4.          Nearly all of the firms visited had one or more investment projects. Many&#13;
of these, however, were poorly defined or unrealistic in terms of their market potential.&#13;
However, the projects containing sufficient information to permit a preliminary&#13;
assessment were reviewed and from this, a preliminary pipeline was developed.&#13;
5.          The pipeline consists of 27 eligible projects with a total estimated&#13;
investment amount of US$49 million and total requested loan amount of US$34 million&#13;
(see table on page 5). Included in the loan amount are working capital loan requests of&#13;
US$5 million. While virtually all Kyrgyz enterprises need working capital, the only&#13;
working capital projects added to the pipeline were for those companies which would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 61 -                               Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
able to generate hard currency earnings or have a very high assurance of selling their&#13;
product on the local market.&#13;
6.           Additional projects are expected to be added to this list as the privatization&#13;
process progresses and more viable projects are identified.&#13;
7.           Basic information gathered on each project is presented in the attached&#13;
table.&#13;
Enterprise:&#13;
Privatized name of the enterprise which has been transformed into a joint&#13;
stock company&#13;
Total Investment (including working capital):&#13;
Estimated value of the total project investment costs in millions of dollars&#13;
based on a combination of management's and the World Bank's assessment.&#13;
Loan Amount:&#13;
Estimated value of the credit required by the enterprise to implement the&#13;
project.&#13;
Period:&#13;
Projected period required for repayment of loan.&#13;
Brief Description:&#13;
Projects were classified into four basic categories, those proposing:&#13;
*     To Introduce New Production Line:  Including those projects&#13;
designed to generate a new product or replace an existing&#13;
production line with modern equipment.&#13;
*     To Improve Production Quality: Including projects which enhance&#13;
an existing product by (i) replacing part of the production line with&#13;
new equipment, (ii) adding one or more finishing steps. or (iii)&#13;
purchasing higher quality raw materials.&#13;
*     To Widen Product Line: Including projects proposing to generate&#13;
a broader product line by adding some production steps or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -                              Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
expanding the functions of an existing production step.&#13;
Working Capital Investment:  Including projects designed to&#13;
facilitate an increase in production of existing lines through the&#13;
acquisition of spare parts or raw materials.&#13;
Purpose of Loan:&#13;
Describes the specific nature of the investment for example, the type of&#13;
equipment required for the project.&#13;
Market for New Product:&#13;
Most of the projects were not supported by market studies as the&#13;
engineering/production emphasis of the industrial sector remains very strong. At each&#13;
company, the management was asked to identify the market for the project and to provide&#13;
very rough estimates of product destination, quantities, and prices. These replies were&#13;
simplified into:&#13;
Local: representing the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
CIS: representing the former Soviet Union, (which for these companies&#13;
means principally Siberia, Kazakstan, and Uzbekistan), and,&#13;
Hard currency (HC): representing markets paying in hard currency&#13;
including China.&#13;
It should be noted that for the enterprises visited, all trade into the CIS is&#13;
either by barter or denominated in hard currency.&#13;
Project Risk:&#13;
Assessment of project risk is based on:&#13;
(i)   perception of management competence;&#13;
(ii)  the state of the physical facility and existing production;&#13;
(iii)  estimated competitiveness of the proposed product in the&#13;
proposed or projected market; and,&#13;
(iv)   appropriateness of the technology to be utilized.&#13;

Many other factors such as the financial position, access to raw materials,&#13;
transportability of the finished product to the destination market were only superficially&#13;
considered and will need to be analyzed more thoroughly by the consultants to be&#13;
engaged under the technical assistance component of the World Bank project.&#13;
Ownership:&#13;
Only projects with 51 percent or more private ownership are considered&#13;
in this pipeline. As the privatization program progresses, therefore, additional projects&#13;
will be added.&#13;
Pvt:  Indicates private or non-state ownership of shares;&#13;
SPF: Indicates state ownership through the State Property Fund (the&#13;
Government's privatization agency);&#13;
Holding Company: Indicates ownership by a state holding company;&#13;
Coll: Indicates ownership by the workers collective and in certain cases&#13;
is classified as private ownership.&#13;
Enterprises with projects not sufficiently defined to be included in the&#13;
attached list were invited to refine their projects and submit them at a future date.&#13;
Enterprises with investment projects in excess of US$ 2 million were asked to re-examine&#13;
their projects with the intention of either reducing the project to that limit or developing&#13;
a phased investment approach which might fit into the World Bank project guidelines.&#13;
The number of financing projects will increase further, as the credit line information&#13;
becomes generally known.&#13;

            project is designed to foster the development of the private
            sector economy through: the development of an effective
            system of providing technical assistance to enterprises and
            credit to private enterprises; and strengthening of key
            project and other selected financial institutions. The
            project comprises two components: 1) an investment lending
            component to be channelled through a Fund for Enterprise
            Restructuring and Development (FERD) established by the
            government to provide medium term foreign exchange loans to
            export oriented and selected import-substituting projects of
            private enterprises; and 2) a technical assistance component
            which includes funding for management of the FERD, private
            enterprise support, financial sector studies, project
            coordination inclusive of consulting services, and audit of
            project accounts.
