KINGDOM OF MOROCCO&#13;
RAILWAY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   A policy environment conducive to private sector development has largely been put in&#13;
place in Morocco. Since the mid 1980s, growth of private sector exports, particularly in the&#13;
textile and agricultural industries, has been significant. The Moroccan transport sector plays a key&#13;
role in encouraging exports, reducing the cost of imports, and enhancing prospects for growth in&#13;
tourism. Ongoing Bank-financed projects therefore focus on improving port and road transport&#13;
policies. The Government and the Moroccan National Railway Company (Office national des&#13;
chemins de fer, ONCF) first expressed an interest in Bank assistance in 1990. However, the&#13;
Bank's position was that in order to prepare a railway loan two conditions had to be satisfied; i.e.,&#13;
establishment of a Performance Contract between the Government and ONCF, and completion of&#13;
discussions on rail tariffs for phosphate transport. Both of these conditions have now been&#13;
satisfied.&#13;
1.2   A railway loan makes sense only if it bolsters a fully commercial operation of railway&#13;
activities by transforming ONCF into a joint stock company. In the long run, this would enable&#13;
the Government to significantly reduce support to the railway subsector. To achieve this goal,&#13;
ONCF's financial viability and fixed infrastructure (in need of rehabilitation and maintenance,&#13;
which have been delayed due to lack of funds) have to be improved. The proposed single&#13;
currency loan to ONCF with a Spanish Peseta loan tranche in an amount of ESP 5,443 million&#13;
(M) and a US Dollar tranche in an amount of US$42.5 M (US$85.0 M equivalent) would finance&#13;
urgently needed infrastructure rehabilitation, as well as consulting services for the transformation,&#13;
including studies to be carried out.&#13;
COuNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.3   The Kingdom of Morocco occupies an area of about 459,000 km2 (without the Western&#13;
Sahara), characterized by a great diversity of landscapes, from a 3,500 km long and flat coastline&#13;
bordering the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlas mountains stretching across&#13;
the country from the southwest to the northeast. Its population of about 26 M is concentrated in&#13;
the northern region and is growing at about 2.3 percent annually. Morocco is the world's largest&#13;
exporter of raw phosphate and byproducts, which generate heavy rail traffic from mining zones in&#13;
the center and south of the country to the ports of Casablanca, Safi, and Jorf Lasfar.&#13;
1.4   Over the past decade Morocco has instituted enduring reforms designed to achieve&#13;
macroeconomic adjustment and stabilization. Today, significant progress can be seen. Budget&#13;
and current account deficits and debt stock and service ratios have been reduced and inflation has&#13;
been kept to single digits. Wide-reaching and comprehensive reforms have gradually moved&#13;
Morocco away from a predominantly administered economy toward one that is more market&#13;
driven and outward oriented.&#13;
1.5   Yet, Morocco's annual growth rate, which averaged 3 to 4 percent a year during the last&#13;
decade, fell well below expectations and was too low to absorb the country's growing labor force.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Private investment and domestic saving rates remain modest; labor productivity is not increasing;&#13;
international competitiveness has not radically improved; and unemployment is 16 percent. The&#13;
situation has been further exacerbated by the drought of 1995. In view of these macroeconomic&#13;
problems, ONCF's management will have to proceed skillfully with a reduction in its workforce,&#13;
which is desirable to improve its financial viability.&#13;
BANK SECTOR ROLE AND STRATEGY&#13;
1.6   Since 1969 the Bank has provided loans totaling US$549 M equivalent to the Moroccan&#13;
Government for the construction, improvement, and rehabilitation of main roads under five&#13;
highway projects, of secondary and tertiary roads under the most recent project, of feeder roads&#13;
under ten agricultural projects; and for rehabilitation and modernization of port facilities under&#13;
two port projects. The highway and roads projects were designed to encourage investments with&#13;
high returns to the economy, particularly maintenance and rehabilitation; to help build up the&#13;
staffing and organization of the agencies responsible for road construction and maintenance; and&#13;
for transport organization.  The feeder roads projects have met specific needs as part of&#13;
agricultural packages, and were designed as transport and agriculture-integrated investments.&#13;
Bank involvement in financing these roads has encouraged the ministries of Agriculture and&#13;
Agrarian Reform and of Public Works to cooperate more closely and consistently to determine&#13;
appropriate design standards, and to arrange for the maintenance of these low-volume roads.&#13;
1.7   The audit reports for the five Bank-financed highway projects, designed to improve traffic&#13;
conditions, highway maintenance, and transport planning, outline their successful implementation&#13;
with rates of return above appraisal estimates despite cost overruns. Loan covenants were&#13;
generally adhered to, but progress sought on transport planning did not fully materialize, in part&#13;
because of split responsibilities between the ministries of Transport and Public Works. The most&#13;
recently completed highway project sought efficiency improvements in the transport market&#13;
through deregulation of the trucking industry. This deregulation incurred delays; only by the end&#13;
of December 1995 did the Government complete a draft law.&#13;
1.8   The first Bank-financed port project, designed to maintain infrastructure in the ports of&#13;
Casablanca and Mohammedia and now completed, served to establish a good dialogue in the&#13;
subsector and helped to set the stage for a more comprehensive FY91 Port Sector Project. The&#13;
latter project finances facilities for container and Ro-Ro handling in the ports of Casablanca and&#13;
Tangiers, and the construction of a coal terminal in the port of Jorf Lasfar. During preparation, a&#13;
Performance Contract was drawn up that included revision of the infrastructure fee paid to the&#13;
Government by the Office de developpement et d'equipement des ports.&#13;
1.9   The proposed project is consistent with our strategy to reform public enterprises in&#13;
Morocco. It is a response to the Moroccan Government's request for Bank assistance for the&#13;
restructuring process, designed to achieve financial viability of railway operations by 2001, and to&#13;
rationalize and reduce Government financial support to the railway sector.&#13;

2. SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
2.1   The fairly complex transport system comprises about 60,000 kms of roads, a 1,907 km-&#13;
long railway network, 1 I commercial ports, and 20 airports, half of which are at international&#13;
traffic standards. The road network is concentrated in the most populated areas north of the Atlas&#13;
mountains and provides for satisfactory coverage of transport needs across the nation. The&#13;
priority is to provide rural areas with better road access, as part of an effective poverty alleviation&#13;
approach under the 7-year, 10,000-km rural road construction program launched in 1995. For&#13;
railways to meet the challenge of deregulated and hence more competitive roads, infrastructure&#13;
will have to be rehabilitated and equipment modernized. The port subsector was strengthened&#13;
following construction of major facilities in Agadir, Jorf Lasfar, and Nador, although Casablanca&#13;
remains the main center of activity. Driven by cargo unitization and investments in specialized&#13;
equipment, port productivity doubled during the last ten years. Finally, a large program of airport&#13;
expansion was carried out in the early 1990s at a time when traffic was abating, which led to&#13;
overcapacity.&#13;
2.2   Roads are the prevalent mode of transportation and have further expanded their market&#13;
share in recent years. Of total traffic, rail represents about 15 percent for freight (phosphate&#13;
transport excluded) and 5 percent for passengers. The insufficient autonomy of ONCF is in sharp&#13;
contrast to the increased freedom enjoyed by road transporters in a liberalized market that, for&#13;
trucking, will be legalized upon enactment of the new transport law called for under the&#13;
Secondary, Tertiary and Rural Roads Project; this legislation will be presented to Parliament in&#13;
1996. Needed organizational changes and transformation of ONCF into a joint stock company&#13;
will enhance ONCF's efficiency, autonomy, and market orientation.&#13;
2.3   For interurban public transport of passengers, the Ministry of Transport (MT) and the&#13;
Ministry of Economic Development (MED) review road and rail tariffs, which are then formally&#13;
approved by the MT. Since freight tariffs have been increasingly market based in recent years,&#13;
notwithstanding existing price regulations, the new pricing freedom should not produce drastic&#13;
changes, even for the railways, provided that contracts are negotiated with major shippers within&#13;
given limits and that flexible pricing remains in effect for passenger services.&#13;
THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
2.4   ONCF, a public corporation established by the Dahir 1-63-225 of August 6, 1963,&#13;
manages and operates rail activities under regulations (cahier des charges) approved by a Royal&#13;
Decree of April 25, 1967. ONCF is under the control of the Minister of Transport, and is&#13;
admninistered by a Board of Directors chaired by the Minister and comprising eight representatives&#13;
from various ministries. ONCF's General Manager is appointed by Dahir. Management&#13;
procedures applicable to public corporations are cumbersome and bureaucratic (e.g., prior review&#13;
of expenses by a financial controller, mandatory use of public procurement procedures). Annex 1&#13;
describes ONCF's organization, while annexes 2 and 3 show that its technical and financial&#13;
performance declined from 1988 to 1994. Since mid-1994 a new management team has designed&#13;
and begun to successfully implement a recovery program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
2.5   ONCF's network (see attached Map IBRD 28080), entirely standard gauge, is 1,907 km&#13;
long (of which 271 kms are double track); 1,003 kms are electrified. The pattern of the network&#13;
is satisfactory; most of the major towns and ports, and the mining and industrial areas are&#13;
connected. Traffic density is high (3.7 M traffic units per route km). Rolling stock and motive&#13;
power availability are satisfactory but partly antiquated (80 percent of the rolling stock is more&#13;
than 20 years old; see Annex 4).&#13;
2.6   Phosphate rock from the mines of the Office cherifien des phosphates (OCP) is&#13;
transported by rail to the ports of Casablanca, Safi, and Jorf Lasfar and to the fertilizer plants in&#13;
Safi and JorfLasfar. In 1994, traffic reached 19 M tons, or 3.400 M ton-km (tkm), for a revenue&#13;
of DH 720 M. Contractual relations between ONCF and OCP have been satisfactory since new&#13;
rates were applied in 1994. General rail freight consists mainly of grain, cement and building&#13;
materials, petroleum products, fertilizers, and sugar. Traffic has remained stagnant since 1990&#13;
(about 4.5 M tons in 1995 or 1,000 M tkm, for a revenue of DH 352 M). For intercity passenger&#13;
transport, ONCF offers three classes of service: a shuttle service between Casablanca, Rabat and&#13;
Kenitra; air-conditioned fast trains between the main cities; and 'brdinary" trains. The quality of&#13;
service (speed, punctuality, comfort, and cleanliness of trains) is generally excellent on shuttle and&#13;
air-conditioned trains; it is average on ordinary trains. After having doubled from 1981 to 1991,&#13;
passenger traffic volume declined from 1992 to 1994; the decline affected ordinary trains, while&#13;
shuttle and air-conditioned services continued to grow. In 1994, traffic reached 10 M passengers,&#13;
or 1,900 M passenger-km (pkm), for a revenue of DH 390 M.&#13;
2.7   ONCF has a permanent staff of about 14,000. Management is competent and fully&#13;
committed to a successful restructuring. Training programs are adequate. Staff productivity, at&#13;
about 450,000 traffic units per year per employee in 1994, is not far from European standards&#13;
(Annex 2). The ratio of staff costs to traffic revenue (52 percent in 1994), while much better than&#13;
in most European railways, is still too high to ensure a sustainable financial situation for ONCF.&#13;
ONCF staff enjoy their own pension system, more favorable than the common system applied to&#13;
private enterprises, with pension benefits paid directly by ONCF; this system places a major&#13;
burden on ONCF finances.&#13;
RAILWAY STRATEGY AND RESTRUCTURING PROCESS&#13;
2.8   The Government of Morocco and ONCF recognize the need for the railway to adapt to&#13;
the more competitive environment of the transport market, to improve its financial performance,&#13;
and to reduce and rationalize the transfer of state financial resources to the railway subsector.&#13;
Various measures have already been implemented since 1994, including: (a) the signature in&#13;
November 1994 of an agreement between GOM and ONCF defining the modalities of the&#13;
restructuring of ONCF debt and of the financial support from the state to ONCF for 1994-1998;&#13;
(b) simplification of the organization chart of ONCF to make it more responsive to customers and&#13;
to increase the responsibility and accountability of managers; (c) cancellation of a number of&#13;
unprofitable passenger services; (d) redeployment of part of the staff from headquarters to&#13;
productive units; (e) revision of phosphate base tariff, and (f) definition of an investment program&#13;
for the period 1994-98.&#13;
2.9   In order to transform ONCF into a commercially oriented, market-driven, financially&#13;
sustainable enterprise, GOM intends to: (a) transform ONCF into a joint stock company (societe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
anonyme) according to a given time table; (b) attract private capital; (c) adopt a new set of&#13;
regulations (cahier des charges) for the societe anonyme, which, among other things, will draw a&#13;
line between commercial services that will be operated in a fully deregulated environment and&#13;
ought to pay their way, and services performed at the Government's request under a Public&#13;
Service Obligation (PSO) scheme that would warrant financial compensation for deficit incurred;&#13;
(d) by the end of the project life (June 30, 2002), reduce Government financial support to the&#13;
railway subsector to compensation for the PSO; and (e) reform the railway pension system to&#13;
relieve ONCF of a burden that soon will become financially unsustainable. ONCF will make an&#13;
effort to reduce costs, develop marketing capabilities, and streamline staff. The main measures&#13;
have been spelled out in a 1996-2000 Performance Contract between ONCF and GOM. The&#13;
Government has committed itself in a policy letter pertaining to the development of the railway&#13;
subsector to: (a) prepare a plan for the transformation of ONCF taking into consideration a&#13;
detailed review of ONCF's pension system, including its actuarial and financial evaluation, and a&#13;
statement of all assets and liabilities to be transferred; (b) submit to the Bank for its review and&#13;
approval an action plan defining dated restructuring measures to be applied to the pension system&#13;
and to be implemented before the transformation of ONCF into a joint stock company; and&#13;
(c) take all actions necessary to ensure that a draft law implementing the transformation of ONCF&#13;
into a joint stock company, is approved by the Government not later than December 31, 1999.&#13;
Both the policy letter and the Performance Contract have been signed and executed.&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The main objective of the project is to support the preparation and implementation of a&#13;
restructuring program that would lead to an efficient, commercially oriented railway operation.&#13;
The principal items of the restructuring program are presented in paragraph 2.9 above. The&#13;
project will also contribute to financing the railway's rehabilitation and modernization program.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   The main components of the project are:&#13;
(a)   a program  of investment for the rehabilitation and modernization of rail&#13;
infrastructure and equipment.  The program  concentrates on the renewal or&#13;
rehabilitation of track and of electric traction facilities (catenary, substations) on&#13;
selected sections of the network and the improvement of signaling and&#13;
telecommunication systems.  Investment in rolling stock is limited to the&#13;
acquisition of seven electric locomotives, the acquisition of 100 specialized&#13;
wagons, and the rehabilitation of part of the passenger coach fleet;&#13;
(b)   studies and consulting services to prepare and implement the restructuring&#13;
program (legal services for the preparation of legal texts); prepare and implement&#13;
the reform of the railway pension system; support the improvement of railway&#13;
management systems (Annex 5); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(c)   a program of acquisition of computer equipment needed for the implementation of&#13;
new management systems.&#13;
The aforementioned rehabilitation and modernization is expected to result in improved efficiency.&#13;
Projected activity indicators are presented in Annex 6. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with ONCF on the key performance indicators, given in Annex 7, which were established&#13;
to monitor progress.&#13;
COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.3   The total project cost (including contingencies, taxes, and duties) is estimated to be about&#13;
US$614 M equivalent, with a foreign component of US$241 M, or 31 percent of the total project&#13;
cost. Cost estimates were prepared on the basis of quantity estimates from ONCF engineering&#13;
studies, from recently completed similar works for infrastructure (for unit prices), and/or from&#13;
international sources (for equipment and materials). A detailed analysis has been made to&#13;
determine the foreign and local costs (Table 3.1). All base costs are expressed in end-1995 prices.&#13;
Physical contingencies (10 percent) have been included to cover possible increases in quantities&#13;
for infrastructure works, and price contingencies have been applied to base costs following the&#13;
Bank's present forecasts of domestic and international inflation.&#13;
FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.4   As shown in Table 3.1, the project would be financed by proposed loans from the Bank&#13;
(US$85.0 M equivalent), the African Development Bank (US$90.0 M equivalent), and the&#13;
European Investment Bank (US$103.0 M). The balance (US$336.0 M) would be financed by&#13;
ONCF's internal cash generation, GOM, bilateral assistance, and commercial banks.&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.5    The Comiti interministiriel pernanent des entreprises publiques (CIPEP) will approve&#13;
all aspects dealing with transforming ONCF into a joint stock company. The project will be&#13;
executed by ONCF. The loan agreement will provide for the transfer to the joint stock company&#13;
that will replace ONCF of all ONCF's obligations to the Bank, including those obligations related&#13;
to the execution of the project. A high-level officer from ONCF will be appointed by the General&#13;
Manager as the Bank interlocutor for all current matters related to the project; this officer will&#13;
also liaise with other cofinanciers. A mid-term review of progress achieved in implementing the&#13;
project will be carried out not later than February 15, 1999. The project implementation schedule&#13;
(Annex 8) shows a completion date of June 30, 2002. The closing date would be December 31,&#13;
2002, to permit disbursement of the remaining loan proceeds for eligible expenditures under then-&#13;
existing contracts. ONCF will provide the Bank with: (a) semiannual progress reports to monitor&#13;
project implementation (commencing on September 30, 1997); and (b) an implementation&#13;
completion report within six months following the closing date of the loan.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.6    Procurement arrangements for the Bank-financed project elements, their estimated costs,&#13;
and proposed methods of procurement are summarized in Table 3.2. Procurement of all Bank-&#13;
financed items will be made on the basis of the Bank's guidelines and standard bidding documents&#13;
for the procurement of goods and works. Standard Bank contract forms will be used.&#13;
3.7    Acquisition of rail and turnouts for track renewal and acquisition of computer equipment&#13;
will be done through International Competitive Bidding. Procurement of infrastructure works&#13;
(track rehabilitation, improvement, and renewal, including earth works and structures), in single&#13;
lots, will be done through International Competitive Bidding after bidders have been pre-qualified.&#13;
Control of works and goods will be done by technical departments of ONCF with the support of&#13;
specialized consultants and laboratories. Publication of invitations to bid for the acquisition of rail&#13;
and turnouts, and publication of prequalification notice for track renewal works were conditions&#13;
of Board presentation which have been satisfied. All bidding documents and contracts estimated&#13;
to cost the equivalent of US$500,000 (US$50,000 for individual consultants and US$100,000&#13;
consulting firms) or more will be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. Other&#13;
contracts will be subject to post review.&#13;

DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.8   The allocation of Loan proceeds of Table 3.3 and the loan's disbursement schedule of&#13;
Annex 9, which are in line with the Bank's profile, are based on a realistic estimate of the time&#13;
required to implement the track rehabilitation and renewal component and the studies provided&#13;
for under the proposed loan. Disbursements for contracts for: (a) goods and works valued below&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent; and (b) services of individual consultants valued below US$50,000&#13;
equivalent and studies and services of consulting firms valued below US$100,000 equivalent, will&#13;
be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). The supporting documents will be held by&#13;
the Borrower for review by Bank supervision missions and auditors. Withdrawal applications for&#13;
contracts above these thresholds will be fully documented.&#13;

3.9   To facilitate the timely implementation of the project, the Borrower will establish a Special&#13;
Account at a financial institution on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The authorized&#13;
allocation will be US$3.0 M equivalent (DH 25.5 M). The Special Account will be replenished on&#13;
a monthly basis, or whenever one third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs&#13;
earlier. Monthly bank statements detailing the transactions in the Special Account, which have&#13;
been reconciled by the Borrower, will accompany all replenishment applications. The minimum&#13;
threshold for direct payment will be equivalent to at least 20 percent of funds in deposit in the&#13;
Special Account.&#13;
3.10 ONCF financial statements have been regularly audited by major international firms since&#13;
1986. The recent report for 1993, 1994, and 1995 contains a few reservations related to the&#13;
pension system but does not question the basic soundness of accounting systems in place. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement has been reached with ONCF that its financial statements, accounts&#13;
pertaining to the Bank-financed portion, special account, and statements of expenditures will be&#13;
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and that the audit reports be&#13;
furnished to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
3.11   Two supervision missions per year during the approximate five years of implementation&#13;
will suffice to supervise all activities. The missions will be staffed by a railway specialist, an&#13;
economist, and a financial analyst and last about three weeks (including a week at headquarters).&#13;
At an average cost of US$2,100 per staff week and an average cost of US$8,000 for travel and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
lodging per staff member, and taking into account that an average of two projects will be&#13;
supervised during each mission, the total cost for supervision (36 staff member missions) amounts&#13;
to US$380,000.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
3.12  The project is classified as Category B. Rehabilitation works to be done under the project&#13;
will only have positive effects on the environment. A review of the environmental aspects of rail&#13;
workshop operations will be conducted as part of the project, and methods of industrial waste&#13;
disposal will be introduced if required.&#13;
4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
4.1   This section describes the economic evaluation of the project's components (ONCF's&#13;
1996-2000 Investment Program).  These components are: (a) track renewal and realignment;&#13;
(b) track doubling between Kenitra and Sidi Kacem; (c) replacement of seven locomotives; and&#13;
(d) acquisition of 100 freight wagons. Details of the economic evaluation are given in Annex 10.&#13;
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY&#13;
4.2   The economic justification of the above-mentioned components has been determined by&#13;
estimating the economic costs and benefits related to expected passenger and commodity rail&#13;
traffic during the next 20 years. The project focuses on core lines and the traffic forecast reflects&#13;
the growth potential assessed for each one. Annual growth rates between 1995 and 2000 are&#13;
within a 3-5 percent range for passenger-kms and a 1.5-4.5 percent range for ton-kms. After&#13;
2000, traffic growth is uniformly taken at 3 percent per year for passenger-kms and eastbound&#13;
ton-kms and at 2 percent for westbound ton-kms. All costs are expressed in end 1995 prices and&#13;
are estimated net of taxes and duties. Where applicable, the economic returns are based on a&#13;
comparison of economic costs of rail transport with those of road transport. These costs are&#13;
expressed as long-run marginal costs and, in addition to operating costs, consist of rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance for road transport and track renewal and of rehabilitation for rail transport.&#13;
ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND SENSITIVTY ANALYSIS&#13;
4.3   The main benefits stemming from track renewal in ONCF's investment program are&#13;
reduced track maintenance costs, reduced train operating costs through higher operating speeds,&#13;
and reduced number of derailments. There are also benefits associated with capacity effects due&#13;
to increased speeds; these benefits are quantified at one-half of the transport cost savings&#13;
compared with road transport, since this additional traffic is essentially an induced traffic.&#13;
Estimated ERs on the Bank-financed track renewal program range from 19 to 25 percent.&#13;
4.4   Rail traffic between Rabat and Meknes is heavier than anywhere else in Morocco. The&#13;
existing track is double between Rabat and Kenitra, and single between Kenitra and Meknes. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
doubling of the track between Kenitra and Sidi Kacem, a distance of 80 kin, which includes some&#13;
alignment rectification between Rabat and Kenitra, is the only new construction component in&#13;
ONCFs investment program. High passenger load factors and major traffic peaks during the&#13;
summer months and holiday seasons justify this investment. Its ER is 28 percent, based on:&#13;
(a) passenger and freight transport savings which otherwise would divert to the more costly road&#13;
transport; and (b) savings in passenger time and train operating costs due to increased operating&#13;
speeds. Transfer of traffic to road transport would occur when the line's capacity is reached. The&#13;
sensitivity analysis assumes that no additional traffic will be generated by the investment, a rather&#13;
pessimistic view that results in an ER of 16 percent.&#13;
4.5   The ER of the seven new locomotives in ONCF's investment program is 27 percent. The&#13;
benefits consist of reduced cost of maintenance and improved availability of the new locomotives.&#13;
The availability of ONCF's old locomotives to be replaced by the new ones is 23 percent; a new&#13;
locomotive has an availability of 95 percent. A sensitivity analysis has not been carried out since&#13;
the estimated ER, although high, is conservative, due to the fact that benefits related to a reduced&#13;
number of accidents with the new locomotives have been ignored.&#13;
4.6   The 100 new freight wagons in ONCF's investment program are needed for the rail&#13;
transport of coal which has recently increased. It is estimated that without these wagons 40&#13;
percent of the coal transport would be diverted to the road, which entails a higher cost of&#13;
transport. Based on a comparison of transport costs by rail and by road, the ER is estimated to be&#13;
54 percent.&#13;
PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.7   The project would not pose specific technical risks. Most risks involve the Government's&#13;
willingness to enforce the stipulations of the Performance Contract and railway subsector policy&#13;
letter. However, the settlement of the long-overdue tariff dispute with OCP, and recent changes&#13;
and progress made in the management of ONCF, prove the Government's commitment to the&#13;
sustainability of efficient rail services. Technical assistance and training under the project would&#13;
reinforce the Government's and ONCF's commitment to the needed reforms by identifying and&#13;
enforcing necessary actions.&#13;
5. FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS AND STANDARDS&#13;
5.1   ONCF maintains a satisfactory management accounting system. Good quality and timely&#13;
financial data are now generated in line with the standard Moroccan chart of accounts. Financial&#13;
data processing systems, which ensure the reliability and integrity of accounting information, were&#13;
upgraded in the early 1990s and their organization and staffing are satisfactory. In accordance&#13;
with current regulations, fixed assets are recorded at their historical value with the consequence&#13;
that their shown value is only one-third of the replacement value. Nevertheless, ONCF keeps an&#13;
off-balance sheet evaluation that does reflect replacement costs, thereby mitigating the issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Monthly indicators cross-referencing operational statistics, revenues, and costing data are&#13;
routinely published and provide useful insight on performance of the railways.&#13;
PAST AND CURRENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.2   ONCF's net -loss soared from DH 202 M in 1990 to an average of DH 740 M during&#13;
1992-1994. Increased competition from road transporters prompted ONCF to freeze its tariff&#13;
after 1991 to stop erosion of its commercial base. As a result, the operating revenues stagnated in&#13;
a DH 1.3-1.4 billion (B) range during 1991-1993. In contrast, operating costs rose at a rate&#13;
slightly above inflation, from DH 1.45 B in 1990 to DH 1.75 B in 1994. Despite a 10 percent&#13;
reduction in traffic, the payroll continued to expand, from 13,700 to 14,500 staff over the period,&#13;
bringing the ratio of staff costs to revenues from about 35 percent in 1990 to over 52 percent in&#13;
1994. The Government maintained its capital subsidy at an annual average of DH 250 M, low in&#13;
comparison to the DH 800 M allocated before 1987. Faced with substantial investment&#13;
constraints for track rehabilitation and equipment renewal amounting to DH 750 M per year,&#13;
ONCF could no longer sustain its operations, even with the 7 percent increase of its tariff&#13;
approved on August 22, 1994.&#13;
5.3   A protocol was signed with GOM in November 1994, following a thorough review of the&#13;
railway's finances and operations by CIPEP. The phosphate rock tariff was raised by 26 percent,&#13;
retroactive to January 1, 1994. The capital contribution by Government was raised to DH 700 M&#13;
per year during 1995-1998. Most important, some DH 3.3 B of tax and debt servicing arrears&#13;
were converted into Government equity. For its part, ONCF undertook to improve its&#13;
performance and to adopt cost containment measures. The FY94 net loss was still a high DH 744&#13;
M due to changes in accounting, forcing ONCF to create provisions for risks that overshadowed&#13;
the real improvement in operating accounts. The current ratio drastically improved from 0.4 in&#13;
FY93 to 1.45 in FY94.&#13;
5.4   The financial condition of the railways improved quite significantly in FY95. Greater&#13;
commercial aggressiveness enabled the railroad to regain some traffic back from road transport&#13;
(e.g., coal). A systematic effort was made to cut costs, including not replacing staff leaving&#13;
service (e.g., those retiring, resigning, or being fired), not using temporary workers, a salary&#13;
freeze, curtailment of in-kind benefits to staff, and streamlining of stores management. For&#13;
passengers, a number of loss-making services were abandoned, stations were closed, and efforts&#13;
were made to improve train occupancy rates, which are still low at about 30 percent. Overall, the&#13;
passenger services supply was reduced by 25 percent but traffic fell by only 1 percent. The net&#13;
loss of DH 609 M was still high, but the net operating loss narrowed down to DH 43 M,&#13;
compared to DH 305 M a year before. This solid performance has been all the more remarkable&#13;
since ONCF faced a one-month general strike in May 1994. The current ratio has improved to&#13;
1.9 following payment and rescheduling of short-term debts (e.g., to the Office national de&#13;
l 'electricite).&#13;
5.5   There is no pension fund. Retirees are paid their rights directly from the yearly staff and&#13;
employer's contributions plus a variable amount paid by ONCF to match the deficit. Since the&#13;
number of retirees increases by about 200 annually, the total cost to ONCF of financing the&#13;
pension scheme has been growing steadily, to about DH 130 M in FY95, which is double what it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
was in FY88. It already exceeds 20 percent of direct labor costs. With the prospect of staff&#13;
downsizing, the issue is bound to worsen unless a new system is set up. Should they be&#13;
recognized in the balance sheet, the accrued rights of the active staff, according to the audit report&#13;
issued in 1996, could represent liabilities in the range of DH 5-10 B.&#13;
5.6   The 1994 protocol requested ONCF to streamline stores keeping. In FY94, the stores&#13;
were valued at DH 825 M, equivalent to two years of consumption, which is very high. This&#13;
amount included DH 120 M of stores older than five years. Loose management, public&#13;
procurement constraints leading to larger quantities being ordered at lesser frequency, and too&#13;
many works carried out by force account have contributed to this unhealthy situation.&#13;
FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.7   Future cash generation hinges heavily on the level of activity that ONCF will be able to&#13;
maintain. Detailed assumptions on traffic growth are given in Annex 11. The projection&#13;
conservatively assumes a 2.5 percent growth in passenger-kms and 1 percent growth in ton-kms&#13;
for freight and phosphate traffic from 1997 onward, following the 1996 recovery that mostly&#13;
comes as a correction for the one-month strike experienced in 1994. The traffic creation induced&#13;
by the project is expected to materialize in 2001 and 2002, adding some 4 percent each year to the&#13;
traffic. Overall, the average annual growth for the combined traffic would be slightly above&#13;
2 percent during the period and the operating revenue would grow from DH 1.6 B in 1996 to&#13;
DH 2.3 B in 2003, assuming that annual tariff hikes recoup two-thirds of inflation starting in&#13;
1997.&#13;
5.8   Labor costs must be brought back to around 30 percent of operating revenues if ONCF is&#13;
to overcome stiffer road competition. The projection thus assumes a reduction of personnel from&#13;
13,800 in 1995 to 10,000 in 2000 and moderation in pay increases throughout project&#13;
implementation after the 7 percent general raise scheduled for 1997. The future activity level will&#13;
have an impact on the evolution of future expenditures related to operations and maintenance,&#13;
but, taking into account fixed costs, productivity increases, improved capacity utilization, and&#13;
decreased reliance on in-house services (close to DH 50 M of works that are internally produced&#13;
at present would be contracted out by 2003), these expenditures are expected to grow in constant&#13;
dirham at an annual pace of only 1.5 percent, and, in current dirham, from DH 594 M in 1996 to&#13;
DH 816 M in 2003.&#13;
5.9  Investments planned for 1996-2000 amount to DH 5.2 B, much of which will fall in the&#13;
last three years. The gross cash flow (DH 264 M in 1996) would not allow ONCF to contribute&#13;
its own resources to the project's financing plan, given the ongoing debt servicing requirements&#13;
(about DH 550 M in 1996). The DH 700 M subsidy (para. 5.3) is therefore essential to enable&#13;
ONCF to finance its share of the investment together with the deficit of its pension system.&#13;
Planned borrowings amount to close to DH 3 B during 1996-2000. From 2001 onward, the new&#13;
joint stock company will be able to generate enough cash to self-finance part of its investment&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
5.10  Table 5.1 presents a summary of the 1996-2003 financial statements, which are based on&#13;
the detailed financial evaluation of Annex 11. According to the forecast, ONCF should eventually&#13;
become financially sustainable. The net loss would be gradually reduced to around DH 331 M in&#13;
2000. As ONCF becomes a joint stock company, the lump-sum subsidy would be removed.&#13;
Instead, the Government would pay compensation for PSO for an estimated total of DH 110 M in&#13;
2001, rising to DH 125 M in 2003. The net loss would further decline to about DH 150 M in&#13;
2003. Furthermore, the Government would cover the pension deficit incurred by the new&#13;
company. The related capital contribution would rise from DH 205 M in 2001 to DH 226 M in&#13;
2003. Should it be treated as an operating subsidy, ONCF would indeed earn a pre-tax income of&#13;
DH 25 M in 2001, rising to DH 80 M in 2003.&#13;
5.11  The balance sheet was already strong in 1995 and will remain that way throughout the&#13;
projection period in the base case scenario.  Stores management would be streamlined within&#13;
three years: from 1998 onward, the stores would represent no more than 300 days of&#13;
consumption. Extended resort to foreign-denominated debt financing would marginally raise the&#13;
debt-to-equity ratio from 23:77 percent in 1995 to 26:74 in 2003. The DH 700 M subsidy to be&#13;
received until 2000 would provide for safe debt servicing despite debt service coverage ratios&#13;
below 1 until that date, and the capital contribution to balancing the pension scheme that would&#13;
apply thereafter would indirectly bring the debt service ratio to 1.7 in 2001, 1.35 in 2002, and&#13;
1.46 in 2003. The minor arrears problems that still existed in 1995 will be resolved by 1997,&#13;
according to the projection, which relies on strict financial discipline by ONCF regarding payment&#13;
of its bills.&#13;
5.12  A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to verify the impact of risks on key financial&#13;
parameters. Lower traffic growth, failure to reduce the labor force to 10,000 by 2000, and&#13;
depreciation of the dirham have been identified as major risks. Materialization of each of those&#13;
risks would jeopardize the future financial viability of the railway company. More drastic actions&#13;
than those considered under the current financial recovery plan would then have to be taken.&#13;
Closely monitoring compliance with financial covenants will be essential so that corrective action&#13;
can be triggered in earnest when defaults occur. The mid-term review will be of particular&#13;
importance to adjust the strategy if need be to ensure that project objectives are still being met.&#13;
Detailed results of the sensitivity analysis are given in Annex 12.&#13;
5.13  During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following: (a) a working ratio lower&#13;
than 0.8 from 1997 to 2000, and 0.75 thereafter; (b) a current ratio no lower than 1.5 from 1998&#13;
onward; (c) a debt-to-equity ratio lower than 35:65; and (d) a labor-cost-to-operating-revenue&#13;
ratio lower than 0.41 in 1997, 0.39 in 1998, 0.37 in 1999, 0.36 in 2000, and 0.31 thereafter.&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1   During negotiations, agreements have been reached with ONCF on the following:&#13;
(a)      the performance indicators given in Annex 7 (para. 3.2);&#13;
(b)      its financial statements, accounts pertaining to the Bank-financed  portion, Special&#13;
Account, and Statements of Expenditures will be audited annually by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank; and the audit reports be furnished to the Bank&#13;
within six months of the close of each fiscal year (para. 3.10); and&#13;
(c)      the financial ratios given in para. 5.13 will be maintained.&#13;
6.2      The Government has committed  itself in the policy  letter to: (a) prepare  a plan  for the&#13;
transfornation of ONCF, taking into consideration a detailed review of ONCF's pension system,&#13;
including its actuarial and financial evaluation, and a statement of all assets and liabilities to be&#13;
transferred; (b) submit to the Bank for its review and approval an action plan defining dated&#13;
restructuring measures to the said pension system to be implemented before the transformation of&#13;
ONCF into a joint stock company; and (c) take all actions necessary to ensure that a draft law,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
implementing the transformation of ONCF into a joint stock company, is approved by the&#13;
Government not later than December 31, 1999 (para. 2.9).&#13;
6.3   The following conditions of Board presentation have been satisfied:&#13;
(a)   GOM provides the Bank with a signed policy letter (Annex 13) describing, inter&#13;
alia, its intentions to: (i) transform ONCF into a joint stock company (societe&#13;
anonyme) according to a given time table; (ii) attract private capital in the&#13;
operation of rail transport services in a subsequent phase; (iii) adopt a new set of&#13;
regulations (cahier des charges) for the societe anonyme, which, among other&#13;
things, will draw a line between commercial services that will be operated in a fully&#13;
deregulated environment and ought to pay their way, and services performed at the&#13;
Government's request under a PSO scheme that would warrant financial&#13;
compensation for deficit incurred; (iv) by the end of the project life (December 31,&#13;
2002), reduce Government financial support to the railway subsector to&#13;
compensation for the PSO and funding of the deficit of the pension system; and&#13;
(v) reform the railway pension system to free ONCF from its financially unbearable&#13;
burden (para. 2.9);&#13;
(b)   GOM provides the Bank with a copy of the executed 1996-2000 Performance&#13;
Contract between GOM and ONCF (para. 2.9); and&#13;
(c)   ONCF publishes the invitation to bid for the acquisition of rail and turnouts&#13;
together with the prequalification notice for track renewal works (para. 3.7).&#13;
6.4   With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be suitable for a Bank loan&#13;
of ESP 5,443 M and US$42.5 M (US$85.0 M equivalent) to ONCF, with the guarantee of GOM,&#13;
for a 20-year term including a five-year grace period.&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 1 of 7&#13;
ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
I.    This annex describes the economic evaluation of: (a) the doubling of the Kenitra-Sidi&#13;
Kacem rail link; and (b) the acquisition of locomotives. The economic evaluation of other&#13;
components is based on the same methodology, and is available in the project file (in French).&#13;
General Approach&#13;
2.    The economic evaluation of the proposed railway project is linked to economic sector&#13;
work carried out in Morocco through: (a) the Bank's strategy to reform public enterprises;&#13;
(b) observations about rail/road competitiveness; and (c) the railway company's strategic role for&#13;
the transportation of phosphates. The principle environmental risk is the proper disposal of used&#13;
oil in the locomotive repair shop, for which an action plan has been prepared. Otherwise, the&#13;
proposed project will have a positive impact on the environment since it reduces pollution on the&#13;
roads. Fiscal analysis and cost recovery are dealt with in detail in Annexes 11 and 12. Since the&#13;
change in ONCF's management about two years ago, the institutional risk has been minimized;&#13;
the new management has reduced costs of operation by 20 percent in 1995 and terminated&#13;
passenger services where demand was low.&#13;
Doubling of Kenitra-Sidi Kacem Rail Link&#13;
3.    The economic evaluation of this link includes costs of some alignment rectification&#13;
between Rabat and Kenitra since traffic on the Rabat-Kenitra link and that on the Kenitra-Sidi&#13;
Kacem link are interdependent. The alternatives considered are:&#13;
(a)   no doubling of the Kenitra-Sidi Kacem rail link;&#13;
(b)   doubling of the Kenitra-Sidi Kacem rail link; and&#13;
(c)   doubling of the Kenitra-Sidi Kacem rail link plus the platform for the doubling of&#13;
the Sidi Kacem-Meknes link (stage construction).&#13;
4.    Alternatives (b) and (c) have an ERR of 28.33 percent and 18.40 percent, respectively.&#13;
Table I shows the costs of investment during 1997-2000 and benefits related to diverted traffic&#13;
(from road), generated traffic, time savings, higher operating speeds, savings in costs of&#13;
maintenance, and salvage values.&#13;
5.    Traffic between Kenitra and Sidi Kacem is assumed to be constant until 2001 due to&#13;
capacity constraints; in 2001 and thereafter, passenger and eastbound goods traffic are expected&#13;
to grow at 3 percent, while westbound goods traffic is expected to grow at 2.5 percent per year.&#13;
In 2001, generated traffic is assumed to be as follows:&#13;
*  Passengers:     500,000 passengers; 160,000,000 passenger-kms;&#13;
*  Goods:          500,000 tons;      103,905,000 ton-kms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 14)&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
Diverted traffic is based on the difference between weekly forecasts of passenger and goods&#13;
traffic and their saturation level without the doubling of the Kenitra-Sidi Kacem link.&#13;
6.    Average per km costs in dirhams by road and rail are assumed to be:&#13;
Passengers         Goods&#13;
Road          0.6610            1.0927&#13;
Rail          0.3372            0.4335&#13;
7.    In addition, the average value of passenger time is assumed to be DH 4.88 per hour. The&#13;
economic analysis is based on a 20-year period starting in 2001 (the year of opening the double&#13;
line); salvage values have been calculated by assuming straight line depreciation and the following&#13;
expected lives:&#13;
Infrastructure                  75 years&#13;
Track                           30 years&#13;
Catenary                        40 years&#13;
Signalling and telecomm. facilities  25 years&#13;
Equipment of electric sub-stations   25 years&#13;
Construction of electric sub-stations 75 years&#13;
Stations                       75 years&#13;
Level Crossings &amp; Structures    75 years.&#13;
8.    Sensitivity analyses include the determination of the ERRs of the doubling of the Kenitra-&#13;
Sidi Kacem rail link for the following scenarios:&#13;
-     Value of passenger time ignored       ERR = 27.4 percent&#13;
-     With half of forecast generated traffic  ERR = 22.6 percent&#13;
-     Without generated traffic&#13;
and 50 percent diverted traffic            ERR = 16.3 percent&#13;
-     Without generated traffic and annual&#13;
growth in passenger and goods traffic&#13;
is 1.5 percent (starting in 2001)          ERR = 10.0 percent&#13;
With an opportunity cost of capital of 10 percent, the NPV amounts to DHI,090 million. An&#13;
increase in costs of investment of about 275 percent or a decrease in benefits of about 75 percent&#13;
would result in a NPV = 0 (Tables 2 and 3).&#13;
Acquisition of Locomotives&#13;
9.    The benefits consists of  (a) the difference in maintenance costs of the old and new&#13;
locomotives; (b) improved reliability of the new locomotives; and (c) improved availability of the&#13;
new locomotives (Table 4). The reliability is expressed in the number of breakdowns per&#13;
100,000 km and amounts to 8.64 for old locomotives and 1.51 for new ones. The average costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
per breakdown is DH 7,600. The availability of old and new locomotives amounts to 23 percent&#13;
and 95 percent, respectively. The average cost of non-availability of a locomotive is DH 8,437&#13;
per day.&#13;
10.   The economic analysis is based on a 20-year period and an expected life of 30 years for&#13;
the locomotives. The salvage value has been calculated by assuming a straight line depreciation.&#13;
11.   The ERR of the seven locomotives is 26.7 percent.  Sensitivity analyses include the&#13;
determination of the ERRs for the following scenarios:&#13;
Not taking into account the benefit&#13;
related to improved reliability           ERR = 26.0 percent&#13;
Not taking into account the benefit&#13;
related to improved availability          ERR = 20.2 percent.&#13;
With an opportunity cost of capital of 10 percent, the NPV amounts to DH218 million.&#13;
Switching values are of the same order of magnitude as those given in para. 8 above.&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 1 of 7&#13;
FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
Main Assumptions Used For Projections&#13;
Operating revenues&#13;
(a)   Rail services are consolidated under two major business lines:&#13;
-     passengers and parcels;&#13;
-     freight with another subdivision: phosphate, general cargo, and the port&#13;
shuttle for chemicals (called "other revenue").&#13;
The model considers each of these four segments separately.  The current&#13;
projection assumes passenger and freight traffic growth of 11 and 5 percent&#13;
respectively in 1996 that mostly accounts for the one-month strike in 1995.&#13;
Phosphate traffic was not affected by the strike and will likely fall by about&#13;
1 percent in 1996 compared to the previous year. For later years, traffic growth is&#13;
assumed at an annual rate of 2.5 percent for passengers, 1 percent for phosphate,&#13;
and 1 percent for other freight. The projection further accounts for loss of&#13;
petroleum traffic in 1997 (a 3-percent reduction of freight traffic) and for traffic&#13;
creation directly linked to the project (addition of about 4 percent to the trend&#13;
passenger and freight traffic in 2001 and 2002). The tariffs are kept unchanged&#13;
until 1997: they are then assumed to be raised each year by a percentage&#13;
equivalent to two thirds of the inflation rate.&#13;
(b)   After creation of the joint-stock company, Government is expected to pay&#13;
compensation starting 2000 for the deficit incurred by ONCF in providing services&#13;
at its request. The initial compensation is estimated at DH 110 M, growing to&#13;
DIH 125 M by 2003 (the compensation is mostly for passenger services; about&#13;
DH 20 M corresponds to low tariffs granted to chemical traffic).&#13;
(c)   Miscellaneous revenues, of fluctuating nature in the past and of minor magnitude,&#13;
are estimated at a constant DH 10 M.&#13;
(d)   Investments by force account ("Travaux faits par 1'entreprise pour elle-meme",&#13;
or TFEE) are not treated as operating revenue, contrary to ONCF's practice.&#13;
Instead, they are deducted from working expenses. These investments have been&#13;
estimated by ONCF and mostly include materials and equipment.&#13;
2.    Operating expenses&#13;
(a)   The evolution of labor costs depends on the compensation policy and on staffing.&#13;
The 7 percent increase scheduled in 1997 has been taken into account. Staff&#13;
downsizing from about 13,800 in 1995 to 10,000 in 2001 is the main factor in the&#13;
evolution of labor costs. The saving in 1996 value is calculated as the number of&#13;
redundant staff times the average salary (some DH 42,000 per year) times 1.12 to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
account for fringe benefits paid by the employer. The calculated amounts are then&#13;
converted to current value by using the cost of living adjustment factor&#13;
(1.5 percent p.a.) and the average merit increase (2 percent p.a.). The saving&#13;
comes to a total of slightly more than DH 200 M by 2003.&#13;
(b)   For fuel and energy costs, related consumptions in 1995 are first apportioned to&#13;
the traffic. They are projected taking into account the growth prospects of each&#13;
traffic and the elasticity of fuel consumption to traffic growth (0.8 for passenger&#13;
trains, 1 for phosphate trains, and 0.9 for other freight trains) to account for&#13;
expected productivity increases. Inflation factors are then added (4 percent in&#13;
1996, 3.5 percent in 1997 and 3 percent thereafter).&#13;
(c)    Supplies cover materials needed for operation and maintenance, plus investments&#13;
done by force account. The former is derived from an estimate of variable and&#13;
fixed operating costs in 1995 reduced by its labor component and train crew costs&#13;
(combined share of 40 percent). The residual value is then projected based on the&#13;
same principle as the one used for fuel (traffic growth and elasticity of supplies&#13;
consumption to traffic of 0.6 for passenger traffic, 0.9 for phosphate traffic and 0.8&#13;
for other freight traffic). The amounts are then updated for inflation of 4.5 percent&#13;
in 1996, 3.5 percent in 1997 and 1998, and 3 percent thereafter. The projection&#13;
further assumes that about 15 percent of works done by force account will be&#13;
contracted out between 1996 and 2003 which will have an impact on the supplies&#13;
level (they will be reduced by some DH 30 M by 2003). The supplies needed for&#13;
TFEE investments are calculated as 35 percent of the investment values given by&#13;
ONCF.&#13;
(d)   For services purchased, the calculation also starts from the projection of variable&#13;
and fixed operating costs and assumes a higher share of contracted out services&#13;
(from 33 percent of costs in 1996 to 40 percent in 2001). The value of in-house&#13;
services is multiplied by a 1.4 coefficient when they are taken over by outside&#13;
providers (they will charge for overheads, capital costs and the benefit margin).&#13;
The services purchased are estimated in current dirham using the same inflation&#13;
rates applied to supplies.&#13;
(e)   Depreciation is based on 50 years for infrastructure, 35 years for rolling stock and&#13;
15 years for other fixed assets.&#13;
3.    Borrowings. The model features four sources. Except for outstanding loans (see (a)&#13;
hereafter) and the Bank loan, the assumptions on terms and conditions are rough estimates.&#13;
(a)   The debt already contracted at the end of 1995: ONCF provided the corresponding&#13;
debt servicing schedule.&#13;
(b)   Credits totaling DH 600 M  (bilateral assistance and buyers' credits) would be&#13;
disbursed during 1996-2000. Some of these credits are concessional with a long&#13;
period of grace and others are export credits. The projection assumes repayment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
of half those credits starting 1997 with twelve maturities and payment of interest at&#13;
8 percent.&#13;
(c)   Multilateral agencies (essentially the World Bank, the European Investment Bank&#13;
and the African Development Bank) would lend a total of close to DH 2.4 billion&#13;
during 1997-2000 (5 years of grace, 15 maturities, and 7.25 percent interest).&#13;
(d)   Unidentified banks would finance up to DH 700 M or about a third of investments&#13;
undertaken between 2001 and 2003 (1 year of grace, 15 maturities and 8 percent&#13;
interest).&#13;
(e)   All the debt contracted from 1997 onward would be denominated in foreign&#13;
currency.&#13;
No foreign exchange loss was accounted for in the base case scenario as local and foreign&#13;
inflation rates are close enough not to warrant a parity change.&#13;
4.    Investments. Total investments are estimated at DH 5.2 billion during 1996-2000. When&#13;
incurred, expenses are first recorded under "work-in-progress", from which they are transferred&#13;
to the relevant fixed assets after lags that vary according to nature of the works. Fixed assets are&#13;
analyzed under four categories: infrastructure, construction and tracks, rolling stock, equipment&#13;
and tools.&#13;
5.    Inventories. The stores' inventories are reduced to DH 650 M in 1996 and DH 500 M in&#13;
1997, after which they represent 300 days of supplies.&#13;

FINANCIAL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    As evidenced by fifteen years of financial strains that led to the 1994 financial&#13;
restructuring, the expected financial recovery follows a narrow path and could be&#13;
jeopardized, were such potential risks to materialize. Three key parameters are prone to&#13;
such risks: traffic growth, labor costs containment and exchange rates.&#13;
(a) Traffic growth. Adequate cash generation hinges on rising traffic and&#13;
continued competitiveness of the railway tariff. As for the latter, the assumed tariff policy&#13;
(stability until 1997, then yearly revision to partly recoup inflation) is designed to minirnize&#13;
risks. Traffic growth is more uncertain, as deregulation of road transport will foster&#13;
utilization of larger trucks and economies of scale, as well as development of bus services&#13;
that will also be helped by extension of the motorway network. ONCF may prove unable&#13;
to engineer reversal of the negative trend that prevailed during 1987-1994 (minus 1.1 and&#13;
2.8 percent per year respectively for passenger and general cargo traffic). The simulation&#13;
envisages an adverse scenario by which passenger traffic would stagnate from 1997&#13;
onward, and freight traffic other than phosphate would decrease by 2 percent annually&#13;
from that same year.&#13;
(b) Labor costs containment. As an important share of working expenses (about&#13;
60 percent in 1995), labor costs must be reduced for the financial recovery plan to&#13;
succeed. The new management determination to downsize the labor force could be&#13;
undermined by the unions whose strength shows no sign of abating. The simulation&#13;
considers a case where it would be impossible to reduce staff below 12,500 (compared to&#13;
14,000 on average in 1995).&#13;
(c) Evolution of exchange rates.   Depreciation of the local currency has been&#13;
one of many factors that contributed to ONCF insolvency in the relatively recent past.&#13;
Based on projected local and international inflation rates, the future depreciation of the&#13;
dirham should be of limited magnitude (should exchange rates strictly follow the&#13;
purchasing power parity rules, the dirham would depreciate by a mere 1.5 percent annually&#13;
over 1996-1998, then 1.3 percent annually thereafter). The base case scenario assumes no&#13;
depreciation of the dirham. However, failure to improve the macroeconomic framework&#13;
would weaken the dirham, with adverse consequences to ONCF's ability to service its&#13;
debt which would be entirely contracted in foreign currency. The simulation includes an&#13;
adverse scenario corresponding to depreciation of the dirham at an annual rate of&#13;
3.5 percent (in 2003, the dirham would have lost about 30 percent of its value against the&#13;
US dollar).&#13;
2.    The table below summarizes the results of all simulations including one which&#13;
combines the adverse traffic and staffing cases plus a 2 percent annual depreciation rate&#13;
for the dirham.&#13;

3.      The sensitivity analysis confirms that the financial recovery remains vulnerable to&#13;
adverse factors that would not allow implementation of the strategy. The impact of lower&#13;
traffic and of a depreciated dirham would be less severe than failure to reduce staffing&#13;
level, and would still result in cash shortages of about DH 200 M in 2003 without much&#13;
possibility of resorting to increase borrowings since the debt service coverage ratio would&#13;
already be below safe levels (around 1.2 in 2003). The combination of adverse factors&#13;
would bring ONCF to bankruptcy shortly after 2001.&#13;
4.      In view  of these results, it will be essential to monitor closely the evolution of&#13;
financial parameters and ensure full compliance with key targets covenanted in the Loan&#13;
agreement. The mid-term review will be of great importance since it provides an&#13;
opportunity to revise the strategy if need be to make sure that financial targets will be met,&#13;
notwithstanding adverse changes in the business environment. Corrective measures range&#13;
from abandonment of loss-making services to more drastic staffing reductions to below&#13;
10,000.&#13;
I The Government capital contribution to balance the ONCF pension system has been taken into account&#13;
from 2001 onward.&#13;

NON-OFFICIAL ENGLISH TRANSLATION&#13;
OF TBE STRATEGY LETTER&#13;
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO&#13;
September 25, 1996&#13;
Mr. James Wolfensohn&#13;
President, The World Bank&#13;
1818 H Street, N.W.&#13;
Washington, DC 20433&#13;
United States of America&#13;
Subject: Railway Restructuring Project&#13;
Letter of Subsector Strategy&#13;
Dear Mr. President:&#13;
I.    Introduction&#13;
I .    Improvement of the conumercial, technical and financial performance of rail transport is a&#13;
central concern of the policy on increasing the competitiveness of the Moroccan economy and&#13;
rehabilitation of the public finances pursued by the Government.&#13;
II.    Diagnosis of the Present Situation of the Railways&#13;
2.    The present structure of the rail system, which serves most of the major population&#13;
centers, the main ports and the mining centers, is satisfactory from an overall standpoint.&#13;
However, the system needs to be modernized and made more efficient: the infrastructure has&#13;
become partially run down and a part of the system is at the limit of its capacity. As regards the&#13;
institutional aspect, the Office National des Chemins de Fer (National Railways Company,&#13;
hereinafter 'ONCF), which has the legal status of an industrial and commercial public institution&#13;
('E.P.I.C.'), is subject--due to the legislation applicable to it (see Appendix 1 hereto)--to&#13;
management procedures that are often cumbersome and restrictive. ONCF has not posted a profil.&#13;
since 1980 and its self-financing capacity has been markedly negative since 1991. Moreover, and.&#13;
no less disturbing, it must be noted that if no steps are taken to reform the retirement-finding&#13;
mechanisms, the ONCF staff pension scheme will become an increasingly heavy burden on the&#13;
enterprise's future financial equilibrium. For some time now, this subsector has only beerL&#13;
maintained in financial balance by means of significant transfers from the Government. However,,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 13&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
since mid-1994, ONCF's management has been implementing an important program of reforms of&#13;
the enterprise's internal management, the main components of which are listed in Appendix 2.&#13;
Im.   Main Objectives of the Rail Transport Policy&#13;
3.    The medium-term rail transport policy that the Government proposes to implement has as&#13;
its main objectives: (i) sharpening the competitiveness of rail transport, which falls within the&#13;
general context of Morocco's transport policy, namely, upgrading the quality and reducing the&#13;
cost of the services provided to clients, fostering healthy competition between transport modes&#13;
and enterprises, and assuring coverage by clients of the operating costs of transport services and&#13;
of the cost of infrastructure maintenance and renewal; and (ii) reduction and rationalization of the&#13;
Government's financial transfers to the subsector.&#13;
A.   Modernization of the Rail System&#13;
4.    Modernization of the rail system will be pursued through the implementation of an&#13;
investment plan defined in the Performance Contract for the period 1996-2000 (hereinafter&#13;
'S3overnment-ONCF Performance Contract') concluded between the Government and ONCF on&#13;
September 6, 1996, and which assigns priority to infrastructure renewal and modernization.&#13;
B.   Revision of the Financial Relations between the Government and the Rail&#13;
Transport Enterprise&#13;
5.    Regarding the financial transfers by the Government to the subsector, as of the year 2001&#13;
the Government proposes to limit these to: (i) compensation for public-service obligations&#13;
explicitly imposed by the Government (either for operation of special services, or in the form of&#13;
tariff reductions for certain categories of clients, or else for maintaining certain lines or facilities in&#13;
service for specific needs); and (ii) financing of the construction of new infrastructure, if&#13;
specifically asked by the Government.&#13;
C.    Reorganization of the Institutional Framework: Stage I: Formation of a Limited&#13;
Liability Company and Reorganization of the Government's System of Financial&#13;
Control&#13;
6.    The degree of autonomy of ONCF currently contrasts with the increased freedom enjoyed&#13;
by road hauliers in a deregulated market. The institutional framework of its activity will be&#13;
thoroughly restructured so as to give ONCF complete autonomy of operation and to encourage it&#13;
to adopt a resolutely commercial approach. The Government is convinced that reform of its&#13;
control over ONCF and ONCF's conversion into a joint stock company will increase and&#13;
strengthen ONCF's efficiency, autonomy, competitiveness and market-oriented approach. In&#13;
order to ensure that the rail transport enterprise will have the desired freedom of operation, the&#13;
Government will: (i) give ONCF the legal status of a joint stock company; (ii) reform the&#13;
financial control rules applicable to it; and (iii) redefine the regulatory framework for railway&#13;
activity. The conversion of ONCF into a joint stock company will be consistent with the new law&#13;
on joint stock companies which aims at making control of company management more effective.&#13;
The new law sets up a more appropriate legal framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 13&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
7.    The legislation in respect of conversion of ONCF into a joint stock company will include&#13;
provisions to streamline Government financial control by eliminating a priori control and replacing&#13;
it by a posteriori oversight and repealing, as regards the new rail transport enterprise, all current&#13;
legislative and regulatory provisions governing Government financial control, including the Dahir&#13;
No. 1-59-271 of April 14, 1960 as amended.&#13;
8.    As of September 1, 1996, the Government has already begun the internal conversion&#13;
process in ONCF. This process has to include, among other things, preparation of an inventory of&#13;
all components of ONCF's assets and liabilities, identifying those that will be transferred to the&#13;
new company and those that will be assumed or paid off by the Government, noting in each case&#13;
the current value of each item concerned. This will be a diagnostic study of the legal system&#13;
governing ONCF's property and obligations that will define, among other things, the alienable and&#13;
inalienable rights and obligations. This first stage will be concluded with submission, no later than&#13;
June 30, 1998, of the preparatory dossier for restructuring to the Preparatory Comnmittee of the&#13;
Permanent Interministerial Committee on Public Enterprises (CIPEP). During this initial period,&#13;
the Government will determine which elements of ONCF's present assets and liabilities will be&#13;
transferred to the joint stock company. This will make it possible to eliminate from the initial&#13;
balance sheet those elements that could compromise the financial viability of the new rail transport&#13;
company and to ensure that appropriate action is taken in light of the restructuring dossier to&#13;
permit preparation in good time of the text of the law repealing the law instituting ONCF and to&#13;
govern the company that will take ONCF's place. Subsequently, the Government will take the&#13;
necessary steps to ensure that said draft law will be adopted by the Government no later than&#13;
December 31, 1999.&#13;
9.    The new regulatory framework for rail transport activity will be defined by a new set of&#13;
specifications that will be based on standard models submitted by the Bank and concerning which&#13;
the Government has given its agreement in principle (Appendix 3).&#13;
D.   Reorganization of the ONCf Staff Pension System&#13;
10.   The pension service for ONCF's permanent staff is managed by an internal fund which is&#13;
currently operating at a very considerable deficit. It is expected that the ONCF subsidy needed to&#13;
cover this financial deficit would rise from DH 100 million in 1996 to over DH 460 million by&#13;
2015. The equilibrium rate of the ONCF pension system will move from 42 percent of the wage&#13;
bill in 1996 to nearly 80 percent in 2007 and almost 110 percent by 2015. A reliable and&#13;
permanent solution has to be found for financing this deficit. A specific study of the ONCF&#13;
system will be made in accordance with the conditions set out in Appendix 4.&#13;
11.   ONCF's financing requirement up to the year 2000 is covered under the terms and&#13;
conditions of the Government-ONCF Performance Contract for the period 1996-2000. Prior to&#13;
the formation of the joint stock company, mechanisms for funding the pension fund's deficit will&#13;
have to be put in place by the Government. It must be emphasized that conversion of ONCF into&#13;
a joint stock company cannot be considered without an adequate solution of the pension question.&#13;

ANNEX 13&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
E.    Reorganization of the Institutional Framework: Stage II: Development of the&#13;
Private Sector&#13;
12.   Following the conversion of ONCF into a joint stock company, the Government will,&#13;
based on future options, initiate a study to analyze and develop in depth the most appropriate&#13;
approach for ensuring, in the medium term, the active participation of the private sector in rail&#13;
transport activity:&#13;
13.   This study will also establish a plan of action and a schedule for implementing the option&#13;
or options ultimately adopted by the Government. The terms of reference for this study will first&#13;
be drafted in conjunction with the Bank. The report resulting from the study will also be&#13;
discussed with the Bank.&#13;
Please accept, Mr. President, the expression of our highest consideration.&#13;

LEGAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH ONCF CURRENTLY OPERATES&#13;
ONCF, established by Dahir No. 1-63-225 of August 6, 1963, as amended by Dahir No.&#13;
1-70-18 of July 25, 1970, has the legal status of an 'E.P.I.C." (Etablissement Public a Caractere&#13;
Industrel et Commercial, Industrial and Commercial Public Institution) and therefore possesses&#13;
civil personality and financial autonomy. A set of Specifications approved by Royal Decree No.&#13;
23-67 of April 25, 1967 defines the conditions under which ONCF will manage and operate the&#13;
rail system.&#13;
In virtue of its E.P.I.C. status, ONCF is subject to Government financial control under the&#13;
provisions of Dahir No. 1-59-271 of April 14, 1960, as amended by Dahir No. 1-61-402 of June&#13;
30, 1962, organizing the Government's financial control over the offices, public establishments&#13;
and concession-holding companies, and other companies and organizations, benefiting from&#13;
financial assistance from the Government or public authorities or agencies.&#13;

Appendix 2&#13;
MAIN RECOVERY MEASURES TAKEN BY ONCF SINCE MID-1994&#13;
Cost reduction measures:&#13;
No recourse to temporary labor (about 5,000 at beginning of 1994);&#13;
No replacement of retirees;&#13;
*     Rationalization of costs in respect of permanent staff;&#13;
Elimination of staff benefits in kind (official cars, telephone, water and electricity&#13;
expenses, etc.);&#13;
Strict control of travel expenses and overtime;&#13;
Implementation of new infrastructure and equipment maintenance methods;&#13;
Reduction of level of stocks and rationalization of their management;&#13;
Rationalization of overhead expenses.&#13;
Application of these measures reduced operating costs by about 20 percent in 1995 compared&#13;
with 1994.&#13;
Rationalization of rail services:&#13;
Reorganization of passenger services, with elimination of very lightly used services&#13;
(resulting in roughly a 25 percent reduction in total passenger services, entailing a decline&#13;
of no more than around 1 percent in revenue) and adjustment of train make-up on the&#13;
basis of demand;&#13;
*     Elimination of 30 percent of passenger train stops;&#13;
Closing of certain stations no longer used for traffic purposes.&#13;
Commercial actions:&#13;
Signature of an addendum to the contract with the Office Cherifien des Phosphates&#13;
(OCP) for phosphate hauling with adjustment of the base tariffs;&#13;
Seven percent increase in base freight and passenger tariffs in August 1994;&#13;

Appendix 4&#13;
THE PENSION SYSTEM&#13;
1.    The ONCF Pension Fund is an internal fund that manages the pension service for&#13;
permanent staff. It operates in accordance with the rules broadly applied in the civil pension&#13;
systems managed by the CMR (Caisse marocaine de retraite, the national retirement fund). It is&#13;
based on an assessment system without any technical provisions to guarantee the acquired rights&#13;
of both retirees and those still in employment.&#13;
2.    The income generated by the Fund already falls far short of requirements. Owing to&#13;
deterioration of the demographic ratio and a considerable increase in pension amounts payable in&#13;
1990, the balancing subsidy paid by ONCF on top of employee contributions is already very high.&#13;
It is expected to amount to DH 100 million in 1996 and to exceed DH 460 million by 2015. The&#13;
overall equilibrium rate is equal to 42 percent of the wage bill (7 percent employee contribution,&#13;
14 percent employer contribution, and 21 percent subsidy) and would reach 80 percent in 2007&#13;
and 110 percent in 2015. The cost of pensions is going to rise very sharply in the near future due&#13;
to the quickening pace of early retirements.&#13;
3.    The high cost of pensions is the result of the existing very generous arrangements. These&#13;
rules set the normal retirement age at 55 years (50 years for drivers, as compared with 60 years&#13;
for pension schemes managed by the CMR), offer proportional early retirement after 21 years&#13;
service, an annual contribution rate of 2.5 percent, a high reference wage, wage-based indexing,&#13;
and supplementary allowances and reversion of pension rights for family members. These&#13;
provisions are very costly and would be hard to retain with a capitalization system. (They would&#13;
require an annual contribution rate of almost 50 percent with a real financial yield of 0 percent.)&#13;
However, they are quite unaffordable for an assessment-based pension system.&#13;
4.    Funding of ONCF pensions without any change in the current rules represents a huge&#13;
challenge for the Moroccan authorities. A permanent and reliable solution will therefore have to&#13;
be found. The repercussions on the pension systems of other public establishments and on the&#13;
Government budget would be examined in the context of a global study that the Government is in&#13;
fact planning to launch.&#13;
5.    In the intermediate future, a specific study of the ONCF pension system will be made in&#13;
coordination with the possible study referred to in Paragraph 4. An actuarial and financial study&#13;
will be made of the ONCF system covering the period up to the year 2025, and will review its&#13;
management and funding. This study should be started in the context of the preparation of the&#13;
dossier referred to in Paragraph 10 of this letter. The intention would be for it to be completed&#13;
before December 31, 1997, and its recommendations should be specified in a plan of action&#13;
defining the steps to be taken to restructure the ONCF pension system that will be implemented&#13;
upon the formation of the limited liability company that would take the place of ONCF. This plan&#13;
of action will be prepared and submitted to IBRD, for its opinion, prior to October 31, 1998.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Railway
            Restructuring Project is to support the preparation and
            implementation of a restructuring program that will lead to
            an efficient commercially oriented railway operation.  The
            project will also contribute to financing the railway's
            rehabilitation and modernization program. The main
            components of the project are: a) an investment program for
            the rehabilitation and modernization of rail infrastructure
            and equipment concentrating on track, traction facilities,
            signalling and telecommunication systems; b) studies and
            consulting services to prepare and implement the
            restructuring program and the reform of the railway pension
            system as well as support railway management system
            improvement; and c) a computer equipment acquisition program
            for management systems implementation.
