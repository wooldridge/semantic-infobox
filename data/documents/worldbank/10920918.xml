&#13;
The Regulatory Reform and Private Enterprise Division of EDI (EDIRP) conducted a core&#13;
course on Global Reform and Privatization of Public Enterprises in Washington, D.C., from&#13;
June 21-26, 1998. The main goal of the course was to expose participants to the recent&#13;
concepts and practices of enterprise reform and privatization and enhance their capabilities&#13;
to develop and implement privatization and restructuring programs at the national and&#13;
corporate levels. The course had 4 specific objectives, including exploring the meaning of&#13;
client focus, providing an overview of privatization, exploring conditions for successful public&#13;
enterprise reform and privatization, and implementation of privatization. Twenty-eight&#13;
participants attended this course, consisting of university professors, government policy&#13;
makers and business leaders from the Former Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China, as well as&#13;
graduate students from the Columbia University's Economic Policy and Management&#13;
Program.&#13;
&#13;
The course was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) using a Participants'&#13;
Feedback Questionnaire. The Questionnaire was completed by 25 respondents, 89.3% of&#13;
the total participants. Six respondents (24%) were from the Former Soviet Union, 1 (4%)&#13;
respondent from Mongolia, 10 (40%) from China, and 8 (32%) from Columbia University.&#13;
Respondents were asked to rate the achievement of the course objectives, effectiveness of&#13;
instruction, and usefulness of the case studies. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from&#13;
1=minimum to 5=maximum was used for each question. The quality of the course lecturers&#13;
was evaluated on a scale that ranged from excellent, good, average, poor, to very poor.&#13;
Respondents' written comments about the course performance were also content analyzed.&#13;
Following is a summary of the evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The overall usefulness of the course received a mean score of 4.60 on a 5-point scale.&#13;
        This was the highest rating of all course performance indicators in the evaluation. The&#13;
        percentage of respondents who rated 4 or 5 was 100% for those from the Former&#13;
        Soviet Union and Mongolia (mean=5.0) and China (mean=4.80). Seventy-five percent&#13;
        of the 8 Columbia students also gave 4 or 5 on this indicator (mean=4.0).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  There was a general consensus among respondents that the course achieved two&#13;
        specific objectives. One was the provision of a framework for global reform and&#13;
        privatization (mean=4.46) and the other was the course's emphasis on being client&#13;
        focused (mean=4.28). The respondents from China felt that the course was&#13;
        particularly successful in providing a basis for designing similar country-specific&#13;
        training programs (mean=4.60).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Of the 6 case studies presented in the course, the Columbia students found the YPE&#13;
        Sociedad and Argentinean Integrated most useful (mean=4.0). Their ratings of other 5&#13;
        case studies were in the mid-3.0 range. Respondents from the Former Soviet Union,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Mongolia and China indicated that the case studies were very satisfactory, giving a&#13;
 mean score of over 4.50 on all case studies except one item (Bolivia Experience).&#13;
 Lessons from Hungary received the highest score from these respondents, 4.80 from&#13;
 the Chinese respondents and the maximum score, 5.0, from the Former Soviet Union&#13;
 (FSU) and Mongolian respondents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lResults indicated respondents' high approval ratings of course lectures. When&#13;
 converted to a numerical measurement scale ranging from excellent=5 and very&#13;
 poor=1, the mean scores of a total of 11 lecturers ranged between 4.16 and 4.79 out&#13;
 of 5.0. Six lectures received a rating of 4 or 5 from all respondents. Respondents&#13;
 evaluated the course lectures by using a scale that descended in the level of&#13;
 performance from maximum (=excellent) to minimum (=very poor). The use of two&#13;
 different scales may have introduced a bias and lent uncertainty to the results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe degree of respondents' learning was measured by one question on how much&#13;
 respondents learned about each of 10 specific subjects, asked only at the end of the&#13;
 course. No pre-course measure of learning was taken. The mean scores of the&#13;
 Former Soviet Union and Mongolian respondents were in the 4.0-4.86 range on a 5-&#13;
 point scale. Chinese respondents also had very high ratings, all items exceeding 4.0&#13;
 except for one item on private participation in infrastructure (mean=3.90). Responses&#13;
 from Columbia students were relatively lower and mixed, ranging between 3.17&#13;
 (Financial sector and SOE reform) and 4.14 (Corporate governance).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThree suggestions for the course were made in respondents' written comments.&#13;
 These were the need for more country-specific studies from China and Central Asia&#13;
 (N=7), more emphasis on issues of corporate governance, competition, and&#13;
 bankruptcy as a result of privatization (N=8), and the roles of government, including&#13;
 ways to maintain transparency in the privatization process, and successful models of&#13;
 legislation (N=4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lOverall, the ratings on the feedback Questionnaire were high across questions,&#13;
 except for those rated by the Columbia students. The percentage of respondents who&#13;
 chose the maximum scores, such as 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale, was 100% for 19 out&#13;
 of 21 response categories among those from the Former Soviet Union and Mongolia,&#13;
 and 90% or higher for those from China. This may be due to the course content and&#13;
 its emphasis on practical aspects of implementation, rather than theoretical issues of&#13;
 privatization and reform of public enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThere were two limitations to the evaluation. First, there was no indicator measuring&#13;
 the respondents' knowledge at the beginning of the course. The degree to which the&#13;
 course may have contributed to their understanding of the course topics was,&#13;
 therefore, not evaluated. It is suggested that a set of cognitive-based questions be&#13;
 included in the questionnaire to assess changes in their knowledge before and after&#13;
 the course. Second, demographic information was not available in the Questionnaire.&#13;
 A gender question, for example, may have been useful to see whether the 12 (43%)&#13;
 women who participated in the course had similar responses and feedback as men&#13;
 about the course.&#13;
