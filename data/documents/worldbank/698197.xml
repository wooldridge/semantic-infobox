        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Estonia has one of the best overall
            economic reform and, in particular, privatization records of
            any part of the former Soviet Union. It has adopted a range
            of divestiture methods aimed at putting assets into the
            hands of those with the incentives and skills to use them
            wisely. What are the factors that have made this success
            possible? First, good policy. Second, good politics. Third,
            good history. And fourth, good geography. This Note outlines
            the various divestiture methods used in the Estonian
            privatization, reviews the results of these efforts, and
            discusses the problems remained to be addressed. Other
            post-communist countries would do well to examine the
            Estonian program.
