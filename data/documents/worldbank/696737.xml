NWFP COMMU1NITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NHA STRENGTHENING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. THE SECTOR&#13;
A. Country Background&#13;
1.1       Pakistan is a low income country with GNP per capita estimated at US$416 per year&#13;
in 1992. Its population is 110 millionY' and is growing rapidly at a rate of over 3% per annum.&#13;
Urbanization has been proceeding at a fast pace and by 1992 the share of urban population had&#13;
increased to almost one third. Projections are that by the turn of the century the population will&#13;
increase by over 30 million, with half the increase occurring in urban areas. Pakistan's economic&#13;
growth performance has been fairly impressive during the last decade when the GDP growth rate&#13;
averaged 6%. Recent economic growth, however, has been accompanied by large and growing&#13;
macroeconomic imbalances which could seriously affect future growth. Pakistan also performs&#13;
very poorly in its human development indicators, which could prove to be an important long-&#13;
term constraint.&#13;
1.2       The North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) had a population of about 16 million&#13;
in 1991, making it the third largest province in Pakistan. Nearly 84% of the population is rural,&#13;
although urban areas grew faster than rural areas (4.6% versus 3.5%) between 1981 and 1991.&#13;
Urban population growth has resulted from natural growth, migration, and the reclassification&#13;
of large rural settlements as urban areas. As of the 1981 census, only two cities (Peshawar and&#13;
Mardan) exceeded 100,000 persons. Six other localities had populations between 50,000 and&#13;
100,000. In physical terms, NWFP is Pakistan's smallest province, occupying less than a tenth&#13;
of Pakistan's total area. It has a diverse topology ranging from scenic mountains and valleys&#13;
in the north and west to lowlands converging on the Indus River in the east. The Khyber Pass,&#13;
which links NWFP to Afghanistan near Peshawar, has in recent times served as a major conduit&#13;
for refugees. In 1992, about 2.5 million of the estimated 3.3 million refugees living in Pakistan&#13;
resided in NWFP or the adjacent Federally Administered Tribal Areas.&#13;
1.3       The distribution of shelter-related infrastructure facilities in NWFP differs&#13;
substantially from that of the rest of the country2'. Over a third of all households in NWFP&#13;
rely on wells as a primary source of drinking water, about three times the national average of&#13;
11.5%. In addition, nearly 22% of NWFP households rely on sources such as ponds, rivers,&#13;
streams and springs, compared to only 9.5% of the country as a whole. Almost all urban and&#13;
two-thirds of rural housing units have access to electricity. Only 4% of all households have&#13;
access to gas, about half the national rate of 9%. Compared to other provinces, dwellings in&#13;
1990 estimate. The estimated population in 1993 was approximately 120 million.&#13;
Based upon 1989 Sample Housing Survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rural areas are much more likely to have private kitchens, bathrooms, and latrines. Half of rural&#13;
units have separate latrines -- over twice the national average. This is consistent with cultural&#13;
values that emphasize privacy and is evidence of the high demand for such facilities. About&#13;
87% of urban dwellings in NWFP have separate latrines -- a figure comparable to the national&#13;
average of 84% -- but only 42% of these have flush capability as opposed to 70% nationally.&#13;
This indicates a lack of well developed urban sanitation systems. Informal surveys have&#13;
documented major problems with access, drainage, sewerage, and solid waste disposal. For&#13;
example, even in areas where flush latrines are connected to sewers, the local networks often&#13;
empty into neighboring fields without treatment. Filthy ponds and solid waste accumulating in&#13;
streets and vacant lots are familiar sights in many communities. Unsurfaced roads and footpaths&#13;
that become impassable during the rainy season are common.&#13;
1.4       Throughout Palistan, home ownership rates are high by international standards, and&#13;
about 89% of all units are owned. In NWFP, the rural home ownership rate is around 90%,&#13;
about the national average, but the urban home ownership rate is only about 66%, the lowest&#13;
of any province. Urban renters, who occupy 28% of urban dwellings, are more likely than&#13;
owners to draw their drinking water from a piped source outside the unit, to use kerosene for&#13;
cooking, and to lack a kitchen. The additional 6% of urban households who occupy their units&#13;
rent-free are far more likely than owner households to rely on wells outside their units for&#13;
drinking water (22% versus 4%), to use dung-cake, wood, and other (non-gas, non-kerosene)&#13;
sources for cooking, and to lack kitchens, bathrooms, and latrines.&#13;
B. Infrastructure Sector Organization&#13;
1.5       There are many institutions directly and indirectly involved in infrastructure&#13;
development including federal and provincial government agencies, non-governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), the informal private sector and&#13;
individuals.&#13;
1.6       Federal government, through the Planning Commission, is responsible for five year&#13;
plans and annual allocations for the physical planning and housing sector. The Ministry for&#13;
Housing and Works is responsible for sector policy formulation, although preparation of&#13;
particular policy statements may be undertaken by its specialist agencies, such as the National&#13;
Housing Authority (NHA) which was instrumental in the recent revision of the National Housing&#13;
Policy. NHA is also responsible for preparation of plans and programs for low cost housing.&#13;
Utilities such as the Water and Power Development Authority (responsible for electricity&#13;
generation and distribution) and Sui Gas are national entities.&#13;
1.7       Provincial agencies involved in the infrastructure sector in NWFP include the Local&#13;
Govemment, Elections and Rural Development Department (LGERDD), the Planning,&#13;
Environment and Development Department, the Finance Department, the Public Health&#13;
Engineering Department (PHED), and the Provincial Urban Development Board (PUDB). The&#13;
Planning, Environment and Development Department coordinates development activities,&#13;
finalizes annual development programs and approves projects. LGERDD supervises the working&#13;
of local councils. It also executes a rural development program mostly consisting of small&#13;
infrastructure schemes. PHED is responsible for development of water supply and sewerage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
schemes and, due largely to difficulties in handing over schemes to local councils or&#13;
communities, has increasingly taken on operation and maintenance functions. The PUDB heads&#13;
the six Development Authorities in the province, and has been assigned the tasks of integrated&#13;
urban planning. Development Authorities execute provincially-funded development projects,&#13;
undertake works on behalf of other entities, and construct sites and services schemes. There are&#13;
48 urban local councils and 19 rural district councils in NWFP. The local councils are&#13;
autonomous bodies that operate under the 1979 Local Government Ordinance, managed by an&#13;
elected mayor and council members. Local councils, especially in smaller cities, have poor&#13;
administrative, managerial, and technical skills, and are presently being run by appointed&#13;
administrators rather than elected council members.&#13;
1.8       Working at the community level, UNICEF3' has been active in developing small-&#13;
scale infrastructure schemes (e.g., hand pumps) and in providing health and sanitation education.&#13;
NGOs and CBOs have also contributed directly and indirectly to infrastructure development.&#13;
Pakistan is home to several successful community approaches to infrastructure provision. In&#13;
Northern Areas, the Agha Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) has demonstrated techniques&#13;
for developing infrastructure through community approaches. Although the objective of AKRSP&#13;
is to increase per capita income of beneficiaries, its methodologies which include village&#13;
organization, partnership agreements, regular savings with collective banking, and creation of&#13;
women's organizations have broader application. Spin-off organizations in NWFP have been&#13;
active in disseminating lessons based on the AKRSP experience with community-based&#13;
development. The Orangi Pilot Project (OPP), located in Karachi, Sindh, is based in the&#13;
country's largest squatter colony where 900,000 people live. OPP's major activities include&#13;
housing, water and sanitation, and these programs have been undertaken independently of&#13;
government. The sanitation program, which now covers about two-thirds of the area, has&#13;
developed community mobilization techniques, appropriate technologies, and full beneficiary&#13;
financing of on-site capital and operation and maintenance costs. It has also been used as an&#13;
entry point for various other programs. Some of the benefits of OPP have been restricted by&#13;
the limited cooperation between OPP and government agencies, but recently this aspect is being&#13;
better addressed. Through its outreach efforts, OPP has strongly influenced decision makers&#13;
throughout the country and is recognized as one of the world's best examples of successful&#13;
community-based infrastructure development.&#13;
1.9       The private sector, particularly the informal sector, has been the primary driving&#13;
force behind housing development. Housing is usually built incrementally, by hired labor, as&#13;
finances permit and as needs change, and the majority of low-income housing in NWFP has been&#13;
developed in this way. Unlike other provinces, squatter settlements and katchi abadis are rarely&#13;
found in NWFP, due in part to strong traditional ties to land, and development has typically&#13;
been through sub-division and sale of private land. The process is dynamic, and despite high&#13;
population growth, the number of persons per room fell during the 1980s, from 3.6 to 3.4. This&#13;
reflected the substantial growth in housing units with more than one room, which increased as&#13;
a percentage of the total from 50% to 67% during the period.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Sector Constraints&#13;
1.10      Although a dynamic source of new housing, informal private sector development is&#13;
usually undertaken without reference to official planning and building regulations, and services&#13;
are rarely provided at the time of development. As a result, basic infrastructure provision in&#13;
low-income community areas is typically very inadequate.&#13;
1.11      Government's response to this shortcoming has been limited by a number of factors&#13;
including:&#13;
(a)  institutional arrangements in which responsibilities overlap, and which do not&#13;
encourage inter-agency cooperation;&#13;
(b)  financial constraints, and lack of a clear policy framework for dealing with such&#13;
issues as cost recovery, infrastructure standards, subsidies, and targeting of&#13;
beneficiaries;&#13;
(c)  failure to effectively operate and maintain existing infrastructure, partly due to&#13;
financial constraints, partly due to institutional weaknesses, and partly due to an&#13;
unwillingness to accept operation and maintenance responsibility for works&#13;
completed by other government entities; and&#13;
(d)  lack of provisions for directly involving communities in infrastructure projects.&#13;
1.12      The international donor community has sometimes compounded problems by poorly&#13;
coordinating its efforts and by adopting inconsistent policies, although the development of IDA's&#13;
Social Action Program Project (Credit 2593-PAK) should help to address some of these&#13;
shortcomings.&#13;
D. Bank Group's Experience in Infrastructure and Upgrading&#13;
1.13      The International Development Association (IDA) has financed nine infrastructure&#13;
projects in Palistan, four in Lahore, four in Sindh (of which three in Karachi), and a rural water&#13;
supply and sanitation project in Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Sindh, and Balochistan. This would&#13;
be the first infrastructure project in NWFP involving IDA.&#13;
1.14      Following two earlier water and sanitation projects, the multi-sector Lahore Urban&#13;
Development Project (Credit 1348-PAK) included a component for infrastructure upgrading&#13;
which was completed successfully. The ongoing Punjab Urban Development Project (Credit&#13;
1895-PAK) contains further upgrading components. The components in Lahore are proceeding&#13;
satisfactorily and are 75 % complete. The upgrading has improved access to basic infrastructure&#13;
for a substantial number of Lahore's poorer citizens, has leveraged additional private investment&#13;
to further improve living conditions, and has demonstrated several innovative designs which are&#13;
now being replicated in other projects throughout Pakistan. Nevertheless, cost recovery, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the transfer of completed assets for operation and maintenance have proved difficult, and the&#13;
lack of a structured form of community participation may have contributed to these problems.&#13;
1.15      Four credits have been made in Sindh, two for water supply and sewerage and two&#13;
for urban development. The Karachi Special Development project (Credit 1652-PAK) included&#13;
a component for infrastructure upgrading in low-income areas, but implementation, particularly&#13;
with regard to cost recovery, was uneven due to poor organization and weak management.&#13;
Appropriate infrastructure standards, however, are beginning to be adopted by the concerned&#13;
government agencies.&#13;
1.16      The Sindh Special Development Project (Cr. 2558-PAK) is underway in Sindh. This&#13;
project includes environmental and transport upgrading, environmental impact assessment of&#13;
Korangi industrial area, a series of policy and administrative reforms including adoption of&#13;
adequate environmental standards, and preparation of engineering studies for future infrastructure&#13;
improvements and environmental upgrading in the province through community involvement.&#13;
The project has been in implementation for the last 16 months and shows that it would improve&#13;
the environmental and health conditions of the low-income urban population, land values in the&#13;
upgraded areas, and establish communal treatment facilities for effluent streams of different&#13;
industrial areas.&#13;
1.17      The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Credit 2228-PAK) is underway in&#13;
Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Sindh, and Balochistan. This project includes the construction of&#13;
new, community-managed, water supply and sanitation schemes supported by a program of&#13;
institutional strengthening, policy reform, and innovative resource mobilization. This project&#13;
has experienced delays and is demonstrating the difficulties of government working effectively&#13;
with communities. In particular, re-orienting the traditional engineering focus of provincial line&#13;
departments towards recognition of the role of communities is proving difficult.&#13;
1.18      The main lessons learned from Bank Group experience, from analysis of Project&#13;
Completion Reports and from OED evaluations of infrastructure upgrading in other countries&#13;
are: (a) upgrading programs that can readily adapt to unforeseen needs or circumstances fare&#13;
better than one-size-fits-all programs; (b) community participation can facilitate project&#13;
implementation especially with regard to identifying needs and mobilizing resources; (c) reducing&#13;
infrastructure standards is a direct means of improving project affordability; (d) cost recovery&#13;
and satisfactory operation and maintenance present major challenges; and (e) successful projects&#13;
build upon the strengths of existing institutions.&#13;

HI. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Ownership&#13;
2.1       The Bank's Shelter Sector Review (Report 7214-PAK, June 1989), and subsequent&#13;
sector analysis and project identification by the National Housing Authority (assisted by&#13;
consultants financed by the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) and the Japanese Policy and&#13;
Human Resource Development Fund and administered by the World Bank) has prompted a&#13;
rethinking of approaches to solving shelter problems of low-income communities in Pakistan.&#13;
The focus has shifted away from the government's earlier approach of constructing and financing&#13;
serviced plots and new homes, towards improving basic infrastructure in low-income areas.&#13;
2.2       Past investments in serviced plots have not tended, despite substantial subsidies, to&#13;
serve low-income groups, and plots have also frequently remained unutilized for many years&#13;
after completion, further diminishing the effectiveness of this approach. The analysis of sector&#13;
constraints has highlighted the need to upgrade the infrastructure in low-income areas, but&#13;
illustrates that this needs to be in a manner which creates affordable and sustainable investment&#13;
programs, and establishes effective operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) arrangements.&#13;
2.3       In seeking to address the infrastructure needs of low-income communities, NHA and&#13;
GONWFP have examined the approaches to infrastructure development and upgrading adopted&#13;
by NGOs and the informal sector. Earlier experience in NWFP of upgrading projects without&#13;
community involvement in scheme planning and design has demonstrated the difficulties which&#13;
can arise with transfer of completed infrastructure for O&amp;M. GONWFP has therefore attempted&#13;
to identify ways to actively work with and facilitate communities. Following project preparation&#13;
studies, managed by its Project Management Unit (PMU), new policies and approaches have&#13;
been tested in two pilot projects, with works financed by GONWFP and executed by community&#13;
self-help. Early results indicate an improved level of beneficiary satisfaction, with increased&#13;
"ownership" of the infrastructure created. These efforts have culminated in the formulation by&#13;
government of a radically different policy framework for infrastructure upgrading (para. 2.5),&#13;
which it proposes to implement through this project, and which demonstrates a commitment by&#13;
government to changing past practices.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
2.4       The project's objective would be to increase the productivity and well being of low-&#13;
income groups in NWFP through improving their living conditions by provision of basic&#13;
infrastructure and community development. This would be achieved by: (a) infrastructure&#13;
upgrading and community development in existing urban and rural low-income settlements; (b)&#13;
promoting the use of demand-driven, participatory design procedures and affordable standards&#13;
for infrastructure; (c) strengthening the ability of provincial and local governments to collaborate&#13;
with communities to implement low-income infrastructure programs; and (d) promoting&#13;
sustainable arrangements for O&amp;M of basic services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
C. Policy Framework&#13;
2.5       GONWFP has formulated a project policy framework to achieve these objectives as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)  the project would provide integrated physical, social and economic&#13;
infrastructure to low-income communities in selected urban and rural areas of&#13;
NWFP;&#13;
(b)  the project would give priority to those communities which demonstrate&#13;
commitment through their capacity for social organization and financial&#13;
contributions;&#13;
(c)  communities, organized into CBOs or user committees, would participate in&#13;
and be jointly responsible for the design, preparation, and implementation of&#13;
infrastructure services and would be fully responsible for subsequent O&amp;M;&#13;
(d)  infrastructure would be developed according to planning, design and&#13;
construction standards suited to and affordable by the communities concerned,&#13;
and local infrastructure would be supported by primary infrastructure as&#13;
necessary to ensure its efficient and effective operation;&#13;
(e)  communities would contribute any land required and at least a 20% share of&#13;
the capital cost of infrastructure (other than primary infrastructure), plus&#13;
100% of O&amp;M costs; and&#13;
(f)  local councils would contribute a 10%  share of the capital cost of&#13;
infrastructure (other than primary infrastructure).&#13;
2.6       The project would provide integrated physical, social and economic upgrading in&#13;
accordance with this policy framework whereby Project schemes would be selected through&#13;
demand-driven participatory procedures.&#13;
2.7       Consistent with this policy framework, schemes would be prepared through a&#13;
process featuring collaboration between government and communities which would comprise:&#13;
(a) community mobilization, awareness training and project identification; (b) community&#13;
participation in project preparation and design, with engineering design assistance from&#13;
government; (c) contribution of cost shares; (d) implementation of infrastructure and community&#13;
development activities; and (e) handover of completed assets and O&amp;M.&#13;
D. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.8       This project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed on&#13;
December 19, 1995. A primary objective of the CAS for Pakistan is poverty reduction. The&#13;
focus of this project upon low-income communities would directly assist achievement of this&#13;
objective by increasing the coverage and quality of basic infrastructure which, together with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
community development programs, would improve living conditions and alleviate some of the&#13;
acute symptoms of poverty. Community development and participation are anticipated to&#13;
improve the selection, design, implementation and O&amp;M of schemes, and thereby improve the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of public-sector infrastructure investments, which is a further CAS&#13;
objective. IDA's experience in Pakistan demonstrates that infrastructure upgrading is one of the&#13;
most effective ways of providing basic services to low-income groups. The Bank's urban policy&#13;
and housing policy papers both support upgrading as a strategy to increase the access of the poor&#13;
to infrastructure and housing to meet their basic needs.&#13;
2.9       IDA has administered trust funds (para. 2.1) which, inter alia, led to the&#13;
identification of this project, and has financed a Project Preparation Facility (PPF 761-0 PAK)&#13;
to complete its preparation, including the refinement of community participation mechanisms and&#13;
the monitoring of the two pilot projects. IDA's continued involvement would allow the&#13;
possibility of retroactive financing for further community mobilization work, to keep up the&#13;
momentum achieved during preparation and to reduce delays after project effectiveness. IDA's&#13;
contribution would include its wide international experience of community infrastructure&#13;
upgrading, the knowledge gained from its previous upgrading work in Pakistan, and the&#13;
continuation of effective working relationships built up during project preparation. IDA's sector&#13;
experience, reflected in the project design, would encourage local council and community&#13;
participation, affordable infrastructure standards, flexible planning and "learning by doing"&#13;
through phased schemes with repeat, follow-up operations. IDA's involvement would also&#13;
facilitate maintaining an emphasis on obtaining cost recovery contributions.&#13;
E. Description&#13;
2.10      The project would comprise two components in support of low income communities.&#13;
The major component is community infrastructure, which is about 90% of project costs, and&#13;
consists of three sub-components: infrastructure upgrading, community development, and design&#13;
and implementation assistance. The other component is institutional development, including sub-&#13;
components for LGERDD and NHA. The project would cost about Rs 1,332 million (US$38.8&#13;
million equivalent).&#13;
2.11      A detailed description of the community infrastructure (CI) project components is&#13;
given in Annex 1. The various components of the project are summarized below.&#13;
2.12      Community Infrastructure (US$28.7 million base costs)&#13;
(a)  Infrastructure Upgrading (US$21.5 million base costs).  Upgrading of basic&#13;
infrastructure would be carried out in approximately 55 urban and rural communities&#13;
covering a total of about 3,500 hectares with a total population of approximately&#13;
420,000. Infrastructure priorities would be established in consultation with the&#13;
communities through their CBOs. Communities would participate in the design and&#13;
implementation process, financing and subsequent O&amp;M of the infrastructure&#13;
provided. Together with the physical investments, training of communities would&#13;
be carried out, to include health, hygiene and sanitation programs incorporating&#13;
continuing integrated support by UNICEF. Infrastructure to be provided would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
include water supply, stormwater drainage, flood protection, streets and footpaths,&#13;
sanitation and solid waste management. Other types of infrastructure, for example&#13;
community facilities or economically productive infrastructure such as markets could&#13;
be considered if identified as a community priority. In addition to the basic local&#13;
(secondary and tertiary) infrastructure, trunk infrastructure required to ensure that&#13;
community infrastructure functions efficiently would also be included. Improvement&#13;
of land registration facilities and documentation would be provided when requested&#13;
by the community. The range of project-financed options from which communities&#13;
may choose would depend on their level of need as determined by community and&#13;
engineering surveys, standards would be subject to minimum and maximum limits,&#13;
and cost ceilings would apply (para. 3.16). Individual schemes would be likely to&#13;
take up to three years to implement but could be implemented more quickly&#13;
dependent on annual levels of contribution from the communities. Implementation&#13;
of the component would be phased over five years based on a conservative&#13;
assessment of the annual affordability of the respective communities. Based upon&#13;
the pilot communities that have been upgraded so far, and the further 12&#13;
communities in Phase 1A that have been designed in detail in consultation with local&#13;
residents, the main initial priorities for infrastructure are likely to be access and&#13;
drainage, with water supply and solid waste management also requested. In view&#13;
of the poor "sanitation" conditions prevailing in almost all sites, and with the&#13;
proposed emphasis on health and hygiene education during the project, on-plot&#13;
sanitation is anticipated to become a high priority component in later phases of the&#13;
project, which would provide about 25 % of the approved cost of a facility as an&#13;
incentive grant to the beneficiary.&#13;
(b)  Community Development (US$1.5 million base costs) This would include: (i)&#13;
community mobilization/capacity building including information campaigns, CBO&#13;
formation, orientation and training activities for community action planning, and for&#13;
government line departments, NGOs and project staff in participatory planning and&#13;
implementation; (ii) health and hygiene awareness campaigns including orientation&#13;
and training of health and volunteer workers using participatory approaches, and&#13;
support to hygiene and sanitation education in schools; and (iii) support to women&#13;
and children which would include action research and demonstration activities to&#13;
enhance participation of women and young children in project activities in three&#13;
selected communities before wide-scale implementation. Services would be provided&#13;
by UNICEF, NGOs and direct contracting.&#13;
(c)  Design and Implementation Assistance (US$5.7 million base costs) Rather than&#13;
substantially increasing its staff to implement the project, government would engage&#13;
consultants, contract staff and NGOs in addition to appointing incremental staff.&#13;
The component comprises:&#13;
(i) the establishment or strengthening, equipping and operation of CI Directorates&#13;
within PMU in Peshawar, and Project Implementation Units (PIUs), mostly&#13;
located at divisional headquarters. All costs are being treated as project&#13;
investment costs (i.e. salaries and allowances of government staff, recurrent&#13;
operating costs and equipment); however only staff and operating costs in an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
amount equivalent to approximately the first two years expenditure, vehicles&#13;
and equipment would be eligible for IDA Credit financing;&#13;
(ii) consultants' services for: (a) assistance with community mobilization,&#13;
infrastructure planning and design; (b) assistance in establishing systems and&#13;
procedures for, inter alia, project management, procurement, construction&#13;
supervision, contract management, project monitoring and reporting,&#13;
documentation, project accounting, and management of project finances; and&#13;
(c) training of Government staff, NGOs and communities as appropriate; and&#13;
(iii) the contracting, through the consultants team, of locally based NGOs/social&#13;
organizers as extension teams to assist the CBOs at the community level.&#13;
Social organizers' (SO) teams comprising one male and one female SO would&#13;
assist the government's 14 social organizer coordinators.  Expenses of&#13;
community motivators would also be paid.&#13;
2.13      Institutional Development and Project Preparation (US$3.2 million base costs). This&#13;
would include studies and technical assistance for provincial and federal government sector&#13;
institutions, and makes allowance to refinance the project preparation facility (PPF).&#13;
(a)  LGERDD Study (US$0.5 million base costs)  This study would review  the&#13;
department's role, functions, responsibilities, and legal mandate; structure and&#13;
staffing; systems and procedures; and strengthening needs. It would examine&#13;
related functions and responsibilities of other departments to identify possible areas&#13;
of overlap, identify options for reassignment of functions and make&#13;
recommendations for government's consideration.  It would also recommend&#13;
arrangements for institutionalizing the PMU's community infrastructure functions.&#13;
The study would consider measures and arrangements required to strengthen District&#13;
Councils, to complement various recent works on strengthening municipal local&#13;
government, and would determine a development strategy and implementation plan&#13;
for strengthening local councils.&#13;
(b)  NHA Technical Assistance (US$1.3 million base costs) Institutional development&#13;
which would comprise technical assistance for: (i) data analysis and sector&#13;
monitoring; (ii) shelter program monitoring; (iii) program evaluation and&#13;
dissemination; (iv) building technology evaluation and dissemination; (v)&#13;
information exchange; (vi) organizational support; and (through the Ministry of&#13;
Housing and Works or NHA, as appropriate) (vii) policy development.&#13;
(c) Project Preparation (US$ 1.3 million) This sub-component would finance the current&#13;
PPF being implemented by NHA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.14      Key project implementation and outcome/impact monitoring indicators that would&#13;
form the basis for review, supervision and evaluation are:&#13;
Implementation Indicators&#13;
(a)  number of CBOs formed and registered;&#13;
(b)  infrastructure layout plans agreed;&#13;
(c)  community development programs agreed;&#13;
(d)  availability of beneficiary contributions and counterpart funds;&#13;
(e)  community training undertaken; and&#13;
(f)  user group/household participation in O&amp;M.&#13;
Outcome/Impact Indicators&#13;
(g)  proportion of households having access to infrastructure services;&#13;
(h)  adoption of affordable standards for infrastructure upgrading;&#13;
(i)  unit cost of infrastructure schemes completed;&#13;
(j)  proportion of facilities in working condition;&#13;
(k) new/alternative development activities initiated by communities; and&#13;
(1) changes in Governments' attitude to collaboration with communities.&#13;
F. Project Costs&#13;
2.15      The total cost of the proposed project, including physical and price contingencies,&#13;
is estimated at US$38.8 million equivalent, of which taxes and duties amount to US$1.6 million&#13;
equivalent. Summary estimates are given in Table 2.1 and detailed estimates are given in Annex&#13;
2. Full details are contained in the project file. The foreign exchange component is estimated&#13;
at US$14.9 million equivalent or 38% of total project costs.&#13;
2.16      The base cost estimates reflect price levels in January 1995. The infrastructure cost&#13;
estimates have been based on detailed engineering designs for 14 communities in Phase LA,&#13;
extrapolated on an areal basis to include the remaining communities assuming a balanced&#13;
package of improvements. Unit costs are based on market rates of labor and material for civil&#13;
works carried out in NWFP. Estimates for materials, equipment, vehicles and technical&#13;
assistance have been based on recent quotations from suppliers, market surveys of&#13;
manufacturers, and contracts.  Physical contingencies of 15% on civil works, 10%  on&#13;
equipment, materials and services, and 5% on vehicles and technical assistance have been&#13;
allowed, the contingency for civil works reflecting that estimates are based on detailed designs&#13;
for 14 of the 55 communities.&#13;
2.17      Price contingencies and foreign exchange conversions have been calculated in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines, using World Bank estimates prevailing at the time of appraisal.&#13;
Foreign inflation rates are estimated as 2.8% for the calendar year 1995, and about 3.3%&#13;
annually thereafter. Domestic annual inflation is estimated to be 6% for calendar year 1995 and&#13;
annually thereafter. For the purposes of converting January 1994 base costs to January 1995&#13;
values, the Bank's projected increase in domestic retail prices of 13.2% has been used. Price&#13;
contingencies amount to 18% of the total estimated project rupee cost. Estimated exchange rate&#13;
parities between US dollars and Pakistan Rupees result in an average Rs. 34.5 per US dollar.&#13;

2.18      The proposed IDA credit of US$21.5 million equivalent would finance about 55%&#13;
of project costs, covering 93% of foreign exchange and 32% of local currency requirements.&#13;
Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) co-financing of US$3.4 million equivalent4' would&#13;
finance 9% of project costs, and UNICEF would provide parallel financing of about US$0.5&#13;
million (1%). Federal government (1%), provincial government (16%), beneficiary communities&#13;
(8%), households participating in on-plot sanitation schemes (7%) and local councils (3 %) would&#13;
finance the balance. The project financing plan is summarized in Table 2.2 below.&#13;

2.19      The proposed flow of funds is shown in Annex 6. The IDA credit would be made&#13;
available to GOP on standard terms. Of the US$2.0 million equivalent for the PPF and federal&#13;
component, US$0.7 million would be passed to NHA through normal budgetary procedures. The&#13;
balance of the credit, US$19.5 million equivalent, would be provided to GONWFP by GOP in&#13;
accordance with its standard procedures, and credit proceeds and counterpart funds would be made&#13;
available to the implementing agencies through budgetary allocations using existing procedures.&#13;
2.20      A condition of Credit effectiveness would be that all conditions for effectiveness of the&#13;
Swiss Contribution agreement, other than those related to Credit effectiveness, had been fulfilled&#13;
(para. 6.2). UNICEF's contribution would be provided partly through its Urban Services allocation&#13;
and partly through other programs being implemented by GONWFP counter parts. As these&#13;
programs are ongoing, the availability of UNICEF's financing would not be a condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
SDC has made an initial commitment of US$3.45 million equivalent for the first 3 years of the project. It would&#13;
consider providing further funding after 3 years if required, subject to satisfactory progress.&#13;

3.2       Institutional relationships are shown in Figure 1. At federal level, NHA, an arm of&#13;
the Ministry of Housing and Works, is responsible for national sector policy advice, and would be&#13;
involved in project evaluation. At provincial level, GONWFP would create a Project Review&#13;
Board, under the Additional Chief Secretary, Development, for top-level project oversight and&#13;
coordination, and a Steering Committee for CI policy guidance and inter-agency coordination.&#13;
LGERDD, which would be responsible for CI, is the provincial government department responsible&#13;
for coordinating and supervising the local government system. Its functions include administrative&#13;
oversight of local councils, provision of senior grade officers and training for councils (through the&#13;
Local Council Board), implementation of infrastructure development schemes in rural areas, and&#13;
management of provincial and local elections. PMU, which would assist LGERDD with CI, was&#13;
established in 1989 to design and implement the Asian Development Bank's Second Urban&#13;
Development Project, and also has responsibilities for infrastructure project preparation (including&#13;
for this project).&#13;

3.3       Owing to LGERDD's close links to local councils, GONWFP has proposed that it&#13;
would be the appropriate department within provincial government to be responsible for CI,&#13;
reflecting the localized nature of CI investments, the need for involvement by local councils, and&#13;
the possible continuing role of local councils in O&amp;M. LGERDD however has a very limited&#13;
technical capacity, and has little previous experience of donor-funded projects. Furthermore,&#13;
LGERDD would need additional powers to address the inter-departmental aspects of CI.&#13;
Accordingly, LGERDD would be assisted with its responsibility for CI as follows:&#13;
(a)  policy direction for CI would be provided by a multi-sectoral Steering Committee,&#13;
chaired by the Secretary LGERDD, reporting to a Project Review Board under the&#13;
Additional Chief Secretary, Development; and&#13;
(b)  PMU would provide the technical resources and capacity for planning, design,&#13;
implementation and day-to-day project management of the CI component.&#13;
3.4       The planning, finance, public health, and physical planning departments would each&#13;
be represented on the Steering Committee, and PMU would be a member and Secretary. In&#13;
addition to policy guidance, the committee would be responsible for approval of individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
community schemes, inter-agency coordination and monitoring of progress.   The Steering&#13;
Committee would be assisted by a Working Committee. GOP confirmed at the negotiations that&#13;
GONWFP would establish by September 30, 1996 and thereafter maintain with membership,&#13;
responsibilities and resources satisfactory to the Association, a Project Review Board, a Project&#13;
Steering Committee, and a Project Working Committee (para. 6.1).&#13;
3.5         GONWFP has selected PMU to provide CI technical support primarily due to PMU's&#13;
demonstrated project planning and implementation capacity, and due to PMU's lead role in&#13;
preparation of the CI component5'. Although initially established under the Provincial Urban&#13;
Development Board, it has been agreed that PMU would report to LGERDD on Cl matters.&#13;
PMU's existing structure comprises a central organization based in Peshawar, and decentralized&#13;
PIUs located at divisional headquarters. This would be augmented for the purposes of the project&#13;
by establishing within PMU a Planning and Community Development Directorate, a Design and&#13;
Implementation Directorate, a Deputy Director Monitoring and Evaluation and a Finance Wing,&#13;
reporting to the Director General (DG). The DG would have responsibility for Cl in addition to&#13;
his existing responsibilities for the Second Urban Development Project. Both Directorates would&#13;
work with and through the existing PIUs for day to day implementation, and these would be&#13;
strengthened to include Social Organizer Coordinators and an Assistant Director Implementation&#13;
for CI. GOP confirmed at negotiations that GONWFP would, exclusively for the purpose of&#13;
undertaking the Project: (a) establish and thereafter maintain with staff, responsibilities and&#13;
resources satisfactory to the Association, Directorates of the Project Management Unit for Planning&#13;
and Community Development, Design and Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation and a&#13;
Finance Wing; and (b) strengthen Project Implementation Units and thereafter maintain them with&#13;
staff, responsibilities and resources satisfactory to the Association (para. 6.1).&#13;
3.6         Implementation of individual schemes would be undertaken with active participation&#13;
of communities. Contact with community groups, and assistance to them, would be channelled&#13;
through locally-based social organizer teams provided by NGOs or by appropriately qualified local&#13;
individuals engaged as contract staff. CBOs would be responsible for assisting in the planning,&#13;
design and implementation of schemes. This would include having a role in procurement of civil&#13;
works (which would be mostly undertaken by private contractors--although provision is made for&#13;
an element of community-executed work), contract supervision and contract management.&#13;
Communities would be responsible for O&amp;M.&#13;
3.7         With a view to institutionalizing procedures for future replication, consideration would&#13;
be given, for the longer term, to full incorporation of PMU's CI functions within LGERDD,&#13;
together with transfer of experienced staff. Options would be reviewed as part of the project-&#13;
PMU was established in 1989 as the key agency for preparation and implementation of the Asian Development Bank's&#13;
Second Urban Development Project (SUDP), which includes an upgrading component. Under the project, PMU has&#13;
demonstrated a capacity for project management, planning and design, engineering, finance, accounting and&#13;
administration. It has also shown flexibility and interest in involving communities in project implementation, based in&#13;
part upon its experiences in implementing the SUDP upgrading component. It has been the lead agency in NWFP for&#13;
project preparation, and has been instrumental in proposing increased community participation to include involvement&#13;
in planning, design and O&amp;M. In addition to developing an in-house capacity for project management, PMU has&#13;
demonstrated its ability to make effective use of consultant services for project preparation, studies and implementation&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
financed LGERDD institutional development study, with the intention of commencing&#13;
implementation of an action plan about mid-1998.&#13;
3.8       In conjunction with the infrastructure upgrading, UNICEF would provide integrated&#13;
training in community liaison techniques, health and sanitation education, and linkages to on-going&#13;
UNICEF-assisted programs, through its NWFP office in Peshawar.&#13;
3.9       Project agencies are reviewed in detail in Annex 3.&#13;
B. Implementation Strategy&#13;
3.10      The CI component would be implemented in three phases over five years. This phasing&#13;
would be in order to gradually develop project management, community mobilization and&#13;
implementation capacities, and in order to provide, at the end of each phase, further opportunity&#13;
for review and adjustment of modalities with the benefit of experience, prior to the next phase.&#13;
Phase 1 would include 20 communities located in 7 urban and 13 rural areas. Phase 2 would&#13;
comprise 27 communities, anticipated to be 12 urban and 15 rural, and Phase 3 would&#13;
accommodate about 8 additional communities. GOP confirmed at negotiations that: (a) GONWFP&#13;
would implement the Project in accordance with an implementation plan satisfactory to the&#13;
Association; and (b) GONWFP would by January 31, 1997 and by each January 31 thereafter&#13;
review and update the implementation plan in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the&#13;
Association (para. 6. 1).&#13;
3.11      The initial stage of implementation would focus upon: (a) strengthening PMU's and&#13;
LGERDD's institutional capacity; (b) monitoring and building upon the experience of the&#13;
community infrastructure schemes already underway in NWFP (two pilot schemes would be&#13;
complete, plus schemes in up to 6 sites would be started using retroactive finance); and (c) a&#13;
gradual implementation of the remaining Phase 1 sites in a staged sequence of 6 to 8 sites each.&#13;
Preparation of Phase 2 sites, in two batches, would start in the second year of the project. To&#13;
facilitate the timely development of institutional capacity, the design and implementation assistance&#13;
consultants for community infrastructure have been selected. It was agreed at negotiations that a&#13;
condition of effectiveness would be the appointment of the Director Planning and Community&#13;
Development, Director Design and Implementation, Deputy Director Monitoring and Evaluation,&#13;
Deputy Director Finance, Assistant Directors PIU and the design and implementation consultants&#13;
for community infrastructure (para. 6.2). Other staff, including staff at PIUs, would be assigned&#13;
in accordance with the requirements of the implementation schedule. The initial period of Cl&#13;
implementation would include further training and orientation of project staff on project concepts&#13;
and participatory approaches. A detailed implementation schedule is shown in Annex 5.&#13;
3.12       It is expected that infrastructure development in most communities would be phased&#13;
over a number of years, reflecting a gradual development of CBOs' capacity, communities'&#13;
priorities, and affordability constraints. Furthermore, each scheme would have a development cycle&#13;
of identification, preparation, implementation, and operation (See Annex 4). As a result, it is&#13;
expected that to complete the upgrading of a locality could take two to three years. Activities to&#13;
be undertaken at the various stages of the development cycle include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
(a)  Identification (3 months) for (i) identification and selection of sites according to project&#13;
criteria and preliminary data; (ii) confirmation visits to sites; and (iii) initial visits to&#13;
communities and contacts with local leaders. The output of this stage is a list of&#13;
eligible sites and a written request from the community to participate in the project.&#13;
(b)  Preparation (6-9 months) for (i) promotion of project activities within the selected&#13;
communities, including information and dissemination, orientation workshops and visits&#13;
to other communities; (ii) mobilization and capacity building of CBOs including entry&#13;
point activities such as health, hygiene and participatory education, and registration of&#13;
the CB0 under the Social Welfare Act; (iii) socio-economic surveys, jointly with the&#13;
community, to establish needs, priorities and affordability; (iv) contacts with the local&#13;
council and line departments concerned; (v) engineering visits and topographical&#13;
survey; (vi) preliminary infrastructure design, assessment of O&amp;M implications,&#13;
costing, review with communities and confirmation of compliance with project criteria,&#13;
adjustment of standards, phasing and prioritization; (vi) agreement of community&#13;
development needs and priorities; and (vii) determination of implementation and O&amp;M&#13;
arrangements. The final output is a Community Action Plan (CAP) prepared with&#13;
involvement of both the CB0 members and PMU/PIU staff, comprising priority&#13;
infrastructure improvements and community development programs, together with&#13;
financing and O&amp;M arrangements including commitments from the local council and,&#13;
as appropriate, line departments.&#13;
(c)  Implementation (up to three stages of 6-12 months each) which, following approval of&#13;
the CAP, would involve implementation of community development programs, health&#13;
and hygiene education, and infrastructure schemes. Initial activities would include skill&#13;
and management training, resource mobilization by the CB0, and detailed engineering&#13;
design by PMU. Implementation of civil works schemes would include procurement,&#13;
construction by contractors or through community contract arrangements, supervision,&#13;
contract administration, and O&amp;M training. Final outputs for this phase are completed&#13;
community development and hygiene education programs, completed infrastructure&#13;
schemes and established arrangements for O&amp;M, including community financing and&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
(d)  Qpation (3-6 months, with intermittent follow-up) for consolidation and adoption of&#13;
assets/handover for O&amp;M, further training, collection of user charges, continued health&#13;
and hygiene and other community development activities, and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
C. Status of Preparation&#13;
3.13      The major part of Phase 1A and lB (18 communities) have been designed in detail&#13;
following the establishment of CBOs and their participation in the planning and design process&#13;
carried out by PMU and its-consultants. The detailed engineering designs would be implemented&#13;
over the first three years of the project. The project has been presented to each of the local councils&#13;
involved in Phase 1, and they have indicated their support and willingness to participate which was&#13;
confirmed at negotiations. Given the innovative nature of the project, pilot schemes have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
implemented, assisted by consultants, and preliminary work would be extended, through retroactive&#13;
financing, to include up to six of the Phase 1 sites. Terms of Reference for major institutional&#13;
strengthening consultancy assignments are finalized and the community infrastructure design and&#13;
implementation consultants are selected. The Project PC-1 is approved by the Executive Committee&#13;
of the National Economic Council (ECNEC).&#13;
D. Implementation Modalities for Community Infrastructure&#13;
3.14       Selection Criteria. Communities for Phase 1, and an indicative list of communities for&#13;
Phase 2, have been pre-selected according to the following criteriaO'.  Eligibility of each&#13;
community would be confirmed by LGERDD during the initial community mobilization process:&#13;
(a)  low income;&#13;
(b)  lack of basic infrastructure or GONWFP identified slum area;&#13;
(c)  size of settlements above 3,000 persons;&#13;
(d)  geographic spread across Province and urban/rural balance; and&#13;
(e)  potential for community participation.&#13;
3.15       Sites where land tenure is found to be in serious dispute will be avoided. In addition,&#13;
areas with a large number of renters or unstable tenant-landlord relationships will initially be&#13;
avoided, until a better understanding is gained of the probability of renter displacement.&#13;
3.16       To be eligible for the project, schemes proposed by communities would need to satisfy&#13;
the following requirements to demonstrate they are technically sound, ready for implementation,&#13;
and economically and financially viable:&#13;
(a)  Community and Local Council Participation and Contribution. The community must&#13;
be prepared to organize themselves into CBOs or user committees, which are officially&#13;
registered, broadly based and include representation of women in order to participate&#13;
in the selection, design, and implementation of the infrastructure and, in particular, to&#13;
contribute at least 20% up-front to the capital costs of the community infrastructure&#13;
(excluding primary infrastructure costs) and to undertake all O&amp;M. The local council&#13;
must be prepared to contribute at least 10% to community infrastructure capital costs&#13;
(excluding primary infrastructure costs).&#13;
(b)  Resource Availability. Primary infrastructure must be available, or would be provided&#13;
by the project. This provision would be subject to a separate technical and economic&#13;
justification and feasibility analysis, prepared for review by IDA prior to scheme&#13;
approval, if the primary infrastructure costs of any scheme exceed 50% of the gross&#13;
cost limit per household (see below). Any land required must be in public or common&#13;
ownership and available for use.&#13;
Data limitations prevent systematically ranking settlements according to relative need. Accordingly, selection criteria&#13;
concern minimum eligibility criteria instead of rankings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(c)  Environmental Sustainability.  The environmental impact of schemes must be&#13;
acceptable, and mitigating measures included where possible. Areas unsuitable for&#13;
upgrading because of, for example, natural or environmental hazards, irregular terrain&#13;
or difficult soil conditions would not be eligible. Resettlement, if any, must be in&#13;
accordance with IDA's standard requirements (para. 5.10).&#13;
(d)  Technical Viability. Schemes must demonstrate improvements benefitting the majority&#13;
of households lacking service, endeavor to provide a balanced package of infrastructure&#13;
elements, as costed at appraisal, conform with planning, design and construction&#13;
standards suited to and affordable by communities, as agreed at appraisal, and have&#13;
implementation arrangements consistent with proven capacities. Infrastructure sub-&#13;
components would be designed as completely functioning systems.&#13;
(e)  Economic Viability. Excluding the cost of primary infrastructure, the cost of schemes&#13;
must fall below a cost limit2' of Rs 7,200' per household net of community&#13;
contribution (equivalent to a gross cost of Rs 9,000 per household), although&#13;
communities would still be able to select a higher cost scheme by contributing full&#13;
incremental c6sts. If gross costs exceed Rs 12,000 per household then data should be&#13;
provided: (i) to indicate the source of incremental financing; and (ii) to reconfirm that&#13;
the site conforms with the agreed selection criteria.&#13;
(f)  Sustainability. The community must be aware of O&amp;M consequences of schemes, and&#13;
prior agreements should be in place for adopting completed infrastructure, for&#13;
provision of O&amp;M, and for O&amp;M financing. Continuing O&amp;M of earlier phases of&#13;
project infrastructure must be satisfactory.&#13;
3.17      GOP confirmed at negotiations that GONWFP would cause PMU to ensure that&#13;
infrastructure and community development schemes to be included in the project would be selected&#13;
on the basis of criteria, and designed, financed, implemented and maintained through processes&#13;
satisfactory to the Association (paras. 3.14-3.16).&#13;
3.18      Model Project Agreements. The key modalities for implementing the component would&#13;
be documented in the following: (a) a CAP, which each community would prepare with assistance&#13;
from PMU/PIUs, to provide the basis for scheme assessment and approval, and which would&#13;
include a statement of the CBO's status, a justification of the need for a scheme, preliminary design&#13;
of the proposed infrastructure and community development activities, environmental assessment,&#13;
investment and O&amp;M costs, a financing plan, a description of arrangements for collection and&#13;
safekeeping of community contributions, and an implementation plan; and (b) a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding (MOU), which would detail the responsibilities for scheme implementation,&#13;
management, financing and O&amp;M, and which, following CAP approval, would be signed by the&#13;
CBO, PMU and local council. Draft model agreements are available in the project file. GOP&#13;
confirmed at negotiations that GONWFP would cause LGERDD/PMU, for each community&#13;
21 Assuming a balanced package of infrastructure elements - if fewer types of infrastructure are proposed, then cost limits&#13;
would be reduced pro rata based on the average shares of various kinds of infrastructure.&#13;
All cost limits are expressed in January 1, 1995 prices, and would be updated annuaUy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
development scheme, to enter into an agreement with the concerned CBO and local council for&#13;
financing, implementing and maintaining the scheme, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Association (para. 6.1).&#13;
3.19      Responsibility for Procurement and Supervision of CI Civil Works. Management of&#13;
procurement would be decentralized, according to responsibility for type of contract, and would&#13;
involve CBOs, local council representatives and consultant technical advisers directly in contract&#13;
award and in contract management. Supervision of non-primary infrastructure contracts would be&#13;
undertaken jointly by the PIU consultant technical adviser, through contract sub-engineers, and by&#13;
CBO representatives. Further details appear in Section F below and Annex 9.&#13;
3.20      Financial Flows. The arrangements for CI component financing would similarly be&#13;
decentralized to PIUs, consistent with infrastructure contracting and payment responsibilities.&#13;
Government's contribution would be funded through the LGERDD's Annual Development Program,&#13;
which would be released annually in advance to PMU. PMU would transfer funds to project&#13;
accounts at each PIU for PIU operating costs and contract services for Community Development.&#13;
Payments relating to the Government's share of non-primary infrastructure (including, if agreed&#13;
between the parties, the local council's share) would be disbursed by PlUs into scheme accounts,&#13;
maintained in a commercial bank, and operated jointly with CBO co-signatories. Timely cashflow&#13;
would be arranged by requiring PMU to release two months average requirements in advance to&#13;
PIUs, and PIU/CBO/local councils to advance equivalent to four months' average requirements to&#13;
scheme accounts, with monthly replenishment. In addition, prior to contract award, a CBO would&#13;
be required to show a fund balance equivalent to its share of the total contract.&#13;
3.21      Women's Involvement.  The pilot project has revealed potential problems with&#13;
involving women fully in the project. For example, in some instances women are not allowed to&#13;
meet outside the home with community workers. Special outreach efforts would therefore be&#13;
necessary to ensure that women's views are reflected in project design and that project benefits&#13;
reach women and children. Initial actions would include: employment of a female social organizer&#13;
in each community social organization team; incorporation of women's support programs (e.g.&#13;
savings schemes, women's non-formal education) within community development programs; health&#13;
and hygiene awareness training directed towards women; and a requirement for women's&#13;
representation on CBOs. In addition, in close coordination with the Women Division, in each of&#13;
three sites, female officers would undertake action research and would implement pilot schemes for&#13;
women groups' formation, capacity building, special education and training, including development&#13;
of linkages to other existing programs.&#13;
E. Operation &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
3.22      It is a fundamental objective of the project to involve the communities more in O&amp;M&#13;
of the local infrastructure which serves their neighborhoods. Nevertheless, the "maintenance&#13;
culture" is not well developed in Pakistan, and accordingly special attention would be made to&#13;
attempt to develop satisfactory mechanisms to involve communities in this process. Actions would&#13;
be taken as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(a)  organization of community user groups for O&amp;M of solid waste collection, cleaning&#13;
of existing drains, and other community facilities (if any) would be undertaken at an&#13;
early stage of the community mobilization process, and communities would specifically&#13;
commit to undertake scheme O&amp;M as part of the process of selecting infrastructure;&#13;
(b)  satisfactory O&amp;M of infrastructure would be considered as a factor when seeking to&#13;
prioritize between communities, and satisfactory O&amp;M of any project-funded&#13;
infrastructure would be a prerequisite for further project infrastructure; and&#13;
(c)  establishment of satisfactory O&amp;M arrangements would be stressed as an important&#13;
output from the component for design and implementation assistance.&#13;
3.23      Activities which have potential of community involvement have been identified and&#13;
further details appear in Annex 8.&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
3.24      Procurement of goods and civil works would be carried out in accordance with World&#13;
Bank Procurement Guidelines. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.1 below, and&#13;
details of civil works procurement arrangements appear in Annex 9.&#13;
3.25      Works. The estimated cost of civil works is US$25.9 million equivalent inclusive of&#13;
contingencies, taxes and duties, with contracts generally under US$ 100,000 equivalent. The small,&#13;
scattered nature of the work would limit the interest of foreign bidders. Civil works for primary&#13;
infrastructure and larger secondary infrastructure would therefore generally be procured through&#13;
national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures which do not preclude international participation.&#13;
Existing procurement procedures of the implementing agencies have been reviewed and suitable&#13;
modifications agreed to ensure adequate competition and encourage economy and efficiency. Model&#13;
bid documents, satisfactory to IDA, and community agreements have been agreed. Procurement&#13;
procedures have been strengthened, principally by involving CBO representatives and independent&#13;
technical advisers at appropriate stages in the contract award and implementation process.&#13;
3.26      The project's civil works can be broadly classified into three types. Type A works&#13;
would comprise principally of primary infrastructure would be grouped and bid as single contracts&#13;
(of about US$150,000 equivalent) at divisional level as far as possible, to attract experienced local&#13;
contractors and minimize administrative overheads. These works would be executed through A/B&#13;
class contractors registered with LGERRD/Local Councils/PUDP/PHED/Communications and&#13;
Works Departments. There would be about 60 contracts of this type. Type B works, consisting&#13;
of typical secondary and more complex tertiary services would be contracted out, in integrated&#13;
annual packages for each community of up to US$50,000. NCB or, in case of poor response, local&#13;
shopping procedures (at least three priced quotations), using simplified percentage rate bid&#13;
documents, would be adopted. Very simple and small-scale project-financed civil works (Type C&#13;
works) estimated to cost up to US$20,000 per contract, in total not exceeding US$5 million&#13;
equivalent, would be procured through direct contracting to communities, using documentation&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;

3.27        Goods.  The estimated cost of goods (mainly site vehicles and office equipment) is&#13;
US$0.9 million inclusive of contingencies, taxes and duties. Contracts over US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB), including the&#13;
procurement of vehicles and equipment. Local suppliers and manufacturers competing for the&#13;
supply of goods under ICB would be granted a margin of preference of 15% of the CIF bid price&#13;

for locally manufactured goods or the applicable custom duties and taxes--whichever is lower--&#13;
during bid evaluation. Other procurement of vehicles and equipment in contracts of less than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent would generally be carried out under NCB procedures aggregating not more&#13;
than US$0.4 million. Minor items including office furniture and equipment, personal computers,&#13;
vehicles and items in small quantities which would not attract the interest of foreign suppliers,&#13;
would be procured through local shopping obtaining price quotations from not less than three&#13;
suppliers, in packages not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent, and not exceeding US$0.2 million&#13;
equivalent in aggregate (including taxes).&#13;
3.28      Grants. The project would fmance incentive grants up to US$40 equivalent each, in&#13;
total not exceeding US$900,000 equivalent, to meet 25 % of the cost of approved on-plot sanitary&#13;
facilities, using documentation acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.29      Consultancies and Incremental Staff.  The estimated cost of service contracts,&#13;
consultants, training and incremental staff is $9.5 million equivalent.  Service contracts and&#13;
consulting services would be procured in accordance with The World Bank Guidelines for Use of&#13;
Consultants. About US$0.9 million inclusive of contingencies would be provided to finance a&#13;
declining proportion of PMU/PIU staff costs.&#13;
3.30      Contract Review. GOP confirmed at negotiations that the first Type A (primary&#13;
infrastructure) and Type B (secondary or tertiary infrastructure) contracts issued by PMU and by&#13;
each PIU, and all individual contracts for civil works and goods estimated to cost the equivalent&#13;
of US$150,000 or more would be subject to IDA's prior review and approval (para. 6. 1). About&#13;
20% of the total estimated civil works and goods procurement would be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review. Post review would be undertaken of the remainder.&#13;
G. Land Acquisition&#13;
3.31      Only small areas of land would be required for the construction of infrastructure, which&#13;
would mostly be provided within existing rights of way. Land is available for the first 2 years'&#13;
construction program. The minor land acquisition anticipated would not be expected to create&#13;
adverse impacts, and if any resettlement is required it would be in accordance with procedures&#13;
satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.10). The cost of land to be provided or acquired has been estimated&#13;
at US$0.3 million equivalent.&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
3.32      On the basis of the proposed implementation schedule (Annex 5 and para. 3.10),&#13;
disbursements would continue for six years. The proceeds of the credit, and the SDC funds, would&#13;
be disbursed as indicated in Table 3.2 below. SDC funds would be disbursed for service contracts,&#13;
consultancy, technical assistance and training for Community Infrastructure and for the National&#13;
Housing Authority components. SDC's funds would be disbursed before disbursing IDA funds for&#13;
these components. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.33      GOP confirmed during negotiations that disbursements would be fully documented&#13;
except those for: (a) civil works contracts under US$150,000 each; (b) contracts for imported and&#13;
locally procured goods under US$150,000 each; (c) contracts for consulting firms less than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent and individual consultants less than US$50,000 equivalent; (d) local&#13;
training; and (e) incremental staff costs. Such disbursements would be made against Statements&#13;
of Expenditure (SOE), the documentation for which would not be submitted to IDA but retained&#13;
by PMU in Peshawar and made available during the course of project supervision. It is estimated&#13;
that about US$10 million equivalent would be disbursed through SOEs.&#13;
3.34      Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursement, GOP confirmed at negotiations that two&#13;
Special Accounts would be opened by PMU, one for IDA and another for the Swiss Contribution&#13;
with an initial deposit of US$1.0 million and US$200,000 respectively, and by NHA, with an initial&#13;
deposit of US$40,000, in the National Bank of Pakistan on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA&#13;
(para. 6.1). The Special Accounts would be operated by PMU and NHA, used to finance all&#13;
eligible expenditures, and would be replenished from time to time on receipt and approval of&#13;
withdrawal applications, supported by required documentation.&#13;

3.35      Most procurement and payment would be through the district-level PlUs, generally by&#13;
the Assistant Director or equivalent, using district level procedures. Efficient project management&#13;
would necessitate this decentralized approach. Existing legal agreements between GOP and the&#13;
World Bank on the operation of Special Accounts prohibit the establishment of subsidiary accounts,&#13;
therefore the Special Account funds cannot be made directly available for use by field offices.&#13;
Project expenditures incurred by district-level field offices would be paid for with Government&#13;
funds from Personal Ledger Accounts or equivalent, for subsequent reimbursement from the Special&#13;
Account.&#13;
3.36      Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing would be provided to cover eligible&#13;
foreign and local expenditures on civil works, materials, incremental staff, vehicles and equipment,&#13;
consultancy services and training up to US$900,000 equivalent, incurred after October 15, 1994&#13;
and before credit signing, needed in order to maintain the momentum achieved during project&#13;
preparation and to prevent delays in implementation of critical project activities.&#13;
I. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.37      Each project entity would maintain accounts capable of reporting all receipts and&#13;
payments in respect of the project including SOEs and any special account. The accounts would:&#13;
(a) record the progressive and the annual cost of the project by component and by infrastructure&#13;
upgrading scheme; (b) account for all project funds (including IDA's) by category of expenditure;&#13;
(c) provide the basis for disbursements of funds (including IDA's); and (d) illustrate the extent of&#13;
compliance with credit agreements. GOP confirmed at negotiations that the executing agencies&#13;
would prepare and submit to IDA within six months after the close of each fiscal year fully audited&#13;
project accounts including an auditor's opinion and report for the project, SOEs and Special&#13;
Accounts, undertaken by auditors satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.1). Under the Social Welfare Act,&#13;
CBO accounts would be audited annually by local commercial audit firms. PMU would obtain&#13;
annually cepies of CBO's audited accounts and would retain these for review by IDA.&#13;
J. Monitoring. Supervision. and Evaluation&#13;
3.38           As the project would incorporate significant innovations with regard to&#13;
community involvement in infrastructure development, a high level and quality of monitoring and&#13;
evaluation would be demanded. The project would be implemented in a phased manner to permit&#13;
a "learning approach" and would include provision for review and adaptation. GONWFP, SDC&#13;
and IDA would jointly conduct regular formal reviews of the efficiency and effectiveness of project&#13;
policies, criteria and implementation progress. GOP confirmed at negotiations that GONWFP&#13;
would prepare, by March 31, 1998, a report evaluating progress to date, including&#13;
recommendations to enhance implementation of the project, which would form the basis for a mid-&#13;
term review by June 30, 1998 (para. 6.1). NHA would take part in these reviews, for the purpose&#13;
of refining national policies.&#13;
3.39           Monitoring and evaluation indicators have been developed to measure: (a) the&#13;
efficiency of project implementation; (b) the effect of infrastructure provision on the environment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
public health and living conditions; (c) the impact on the community's management capacities and&#13;
skills; and (d) the impact on government's capacity to provide facilities and services (Annex 11).&#13;
For the CI component, the primary focus would be on the community level, where monitoring data&#13;
would be generated by the community based planning and development activities. Attention would&#13;
be given to monitoring and review of the efficiency of the implementation assistance, and assessing&#13;
environmental impacts.&#13;
3.40      The disbursed nature of the project, the involvement of different departments, tiers of&#13;
govemment and communities, and the large number of small contracts would necessitate&#13;
development of computerized project management systems for control and monitoring. Outline&#13;
software-based project planning and management tools are in place (for example, see Annex 5), and&#13;
would be further developed and implemented in the initial phase of the project. The PMU's&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit would operate and maintain satisfactory project management&#13;
systems, and would prepare quarterly activity reports, summarizing the activities of the past period,&#13;
emerging problems and issues, required actions and the outlook for the next phase. The reports&#13;
would also provide summary data on the identified set of core monitoring indicators. GOP&#13;
confirmed at negotiations that GONWFP would cause PMU to maintain policies and procedures&#13;
adequate to enable it to monitor and evaluate the project on an ongoing basis, in accordance with&#13;
indicators satisfactory to the Association (para. 6.1).&#13;
3.41      The project is expected to require, on average, about 14 staff weeks per year of&#13;
supervision, or about 72 weeks over the five year implementation period, but in earlier years some&#13;
16 to 17 weeks would be required. This reflects the innovative nature of the project; the logistical&#13;
challenges of the dispersed investments proposed; and that this is IDA's first project in the sector&#13;
in NWFP. A supervision plan, including the project launch workshop, formal reviews, and regular&#13;
supervision mission objectives is shown in Annex 12.&#13;

IV. PROJECT FINANCING AND COST RECOVERY&#13;
A. Present Arrangements&#13;
4.1       Publicly provided community infrastructure is mainly financed from  general&#13;
government revenues.  The majority of investment is through the Provincial government's&#13;
development budget, which is financed from development loans, recurrent budget surplus and donor&#13;
assistance. These sources are supplemented by programs such as the members of the national and&#13;
provincial assemblies' programs and by local councils' development budgets. There is presently no&#13;
attempt to recover the capital costs of infrastructure through direct charges. In urban water supply,&#13;
a program exists to finance local councils' development by equal combinations of council&#13;
contribution, provincial loan and provincial grant. But in practice the local council's direct&#13;
contribution is often not forthcoming, and loan repayments can only be collected if recovered at&#13;
source from provincial transfers to the council.&#13;
4.2       O&amp;M costs of infrastructure are typically only partially recovered from user charges,&#13;
although recently GONWFP has initiated revisions in urban water tariffs, and improvements to the&#13;
administration of collection are being attempted through involvement of the private sector. In rural&#13;
areas, government has a policy of handing over O&amp;M responsibilities for rural water schemes to&#13;
communities, under the umbrella of District Councils. Nevertheless, O&amp;M remains under-funded&#13;
as provincial government is limiting the growth of its recurrent expenditures and is therefore&#13;
unwilling to take on extensive O&amp;M responsibilities, and local councils are financially weak. In&#13;
addition, as frequently neither local councils nor communities are involved in investment planning&#13;
and implementation, there is a reluctance on their part to take over or finance O&amp;M of completed&#13;
schemes. This reluctance may be reinforced by scheme designs which are costly and complex to&#13;
operate.  As a consequence, financing for O&amp;M  is likely to remain inadequate, thereby&#13;
undermining the sustainability of infrastructure investments.&#13;
B. Cost Recovery and Capital Contributions&#13;
4.3       In addition to growing pressures on government budgets, the urgent requirement for&#13;
ensuring operational sustainability of infrastructure is the main rationale for the cost recovery&#13;
structure which would be introduced through the project, and which would form an important,&#13;
integral part of the broad-based community participation process. GONWFP's policy framework&#13;
would require: (a) communities to contribute at least 20% of CI capital costs, excluding primary&#13;
infrastructure, and to be fully responsible for O&amp;M; and (b) for local councils to contribute at least&#13;
10% of non-primary infrastructure capital costs.&#13;
4.4       A principal reason for requiring communities' and local councils' capital contributions&#13;
would be in order to ensure that both have a voice in design and implementation. The communities'&#13;
contribution, combined with procedures which allow a choice of types of infrastructure, would also&#13;
provide an element of rationing in investment decisions, and both contributions would assist&#13;
financing. For the contribution to be effective in achieving these objectives, it needs to be&#13;
collected, and hence the community contribution would be required up-front.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
4.5.      Making communities responsible for O&amp;M costs would address the under-funding of&#13;
O&amp;M which undermines infrastructure sustainability. Encouraging community ownership of the&#13;
infrastructure through involvement in development, making communities financial stakeholders, and&#13;
awareness of O&amp;M liabilities prior to investment would each facilitate subsequent community&#13;
involvement in O&amp;M. As appropriate, advice and assistance would be provided to communities&#13;
through technical and financial training to help them discharge their O&amp;M responsibilities.&#13;
Making satisfactory O&amp;M of existing CI investments a criteria for future CI schemes would provide&#13;
an incentive to establish good practices.&#13;
4.6       Particularly in urban areas, local councils may need to play a stronger role in&#13;
maintaining the primary and secondary infrastructure required to serve community areas.&#13;
Community willingness to pay user charges would not necessarily improve the performance of these&#13;
institutions. This would be addressed in the project as part of the study of LGERDD. Local&#13;
councils would, however, as a result of project procedures be made aware of O&amp;M responsibilities&#13;
arising from schemes prior to signing MOUs, and PMU/PIU and CBO linkages to these institutions&#13;
would be strengthened through project interventions. Community O&amp;M contributions to CBOs&#13;
would also allow the consideration of the private sector as an alternative supplier where feasible.&#13;
C. Beneficiary Affordability&#13;
4.7       Beneficiary contributions to a scheme's capital cost would amount up to Rs 1,500 per&#13;
household on average. This payment, although required up-front, would be payable in advance of&#13;
each stage of implementation of a scheme, which could be spread over two to three years. While&#13;
savings or other liquid assets would be one source of finance, beneficiaries would also be able to&#13;
save up their contribution during mobilization and scheme preparation phases. Where affordability&#13;
would be a constraint, selection of lower cost schemes, or extension of the period between&#13;
implementing each phase of a scheme, would be possible.&#13;
4.8       Sample household surveys (1991) have identified the levels and patterns of asset holding&#13;
of low income households. Assets typically include liquid assets in the form of cash balances,&#13;
short-term deposits with banks, prize bonds, participation in informal rotating credit schemes&#13;
(bisis), etc. of about Rs 2,500 per household in small towns and almost Rs 6,000 in large cities.&#13;
As such, it is estimated that over 90% of the beneficiaries in large cities and 70% in small towns&#13;
can afford to make contributions of up to Rs 2,000 per household.&#13;
4.9       The willingness to make such contributions presupposes a demand for the community&#13;
infrastructure being offered; confidence that government would, through the project and in&#13;
conjunction with communities, deliver these services; and an expectation that the desired services&#13;
could not be obtained through one of various alternative "free" programs. Project preparation&#13;
indicates that demand exists, although communities are initially cautious and skeptical. The project&#13;
includes measures to advertise and disseminate information about results and successes, in order&#13;
to overcome initial doubts, and actions, for example health and hygiene awareness training, to&#13;
generate effective demand for balanced packages of infrastructure and community development.&#13;
4.10       Given this, there are reasons to believe that the willingness to make significant up-&#13;
front cash contributions may be high. First, private returns from such payments are likely to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
substantial. A personal contribution of Rs 2,000 can lead to an increase in value of land owned&#13;
which is five to seven times the outlay. Second, studies of the determinants of rent (rent hedonics)&#13;
in low income areas in the cities of Paldstan reveal the high premium that is attached by low&#13;
income households in squatter and slum areas to service improvements. Estimates of the increase&#13;
in rent' from improved water supply is about 18% to 27%. If this increase in rent is capitalized,&#13;
then the average increase in property value (assuming a 12-1/2% rate of discount) is almost Rs&#13;
5,200. Similarly, the increase in rental value due to an improved access road is about 8% to 10%.&#13;
These gains appear to justify significant self-financing of service improvements by low-income&#13;
communities in urban areas.&#13;
4.11      Affordability for payment of user charges to cover O&amp;M costs of services provided,&#13;
appears to be less of a problem. User charges are estimated at between Rs 20 to Rs 25 per month&#13;
per household. The median monthly income of urban households in NWFP is about Rs 2,600. As&#13;
such, the burden of these payments is likely to be only about 1 % to 2% of income for most of the&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
D. Government Affordability&#13;
4.12      In urban areas in NWFP, local council spending averaged Rs 164 per head in 1990/91.&#13;
Of this, about Rs 42 was classified as development expenditure, although this classification would&#13;
include some expenditures of a recurrent nature. Assuming that a scheme extends for a three year&#13;
period, local council development expenditure per household during this period would be on&#13;
average more than the 10% contribution required. In rural areas in NWFP, district councils average&#13;
expenditure per head in 1990/91 was Rs 19 in total, of which Rs 11 was for development. This&#13;
would be somewhat below the equivalent 10% maximum contribution to upgrading costs (estimated&#13;
as 10% of Rs 6,000 per household). The expenditure would nevertheless be small within the&#13;
context of the whole budget (typically 1% - 2%) and is therefore considered affordable.&#13;
4.13      Following the National Finance Commission award, which included for NWFP the&#13;
provision of a share of WAPDA's profits, the province has been able to earn a surplus on its&#13;
revenue account. In 1992/93, the revenue surplus is budgeted to amount to Rs 1,458 million,&#13;
contributing 22% of the total Rs 6,575 million development budget. Within the total development&#13;
budget, the allocation for basic infrastructure amounted to some Rs 500 million, excluding Social&#13;
Action Program and foreign project assistance. The provincial share of project capital expenditure&#13;
would be between 10% and 15% of regular sector allocations in urban areas, and would be about&#13;
20% of sector allocations in rural areas.&#13;
4.14      Despite increasing debt service liabilities, the province is aiming to retain a revenue&#13;
account surplus in the medium term, partly by controls on recurring expenditure levels. Therefore&#13;
some flexibility would remain in the province's development budget. The above mentioned levels&#13;
of provincial contribution (amounting in total to less than 6% of the current level of revenue&#13;
account surplus, based on the size of project proposed) would therefore be sustainable, particularly&#13;
given the other financial benefits to the province of community and local council contributions to&#13;
capital costs and responsibility for O&amp;M.&#13;

V. PROJECT JUSTIfCATION AND RISKS&#13;
5.1       The investment program would alleviate some of the acute symptoms of poverty, and&#13;
lay the foundation for strengthened procedures to provide improved access to basic services in the&#13;
future. The main investment component, infrastructure upgrading, would provide a direct impact&#13;
in terms of improving the living conditions of poorer households, especially for women and&#13;
children. Experience elsewhere in Pakistan demonstrates that investment in basic infrastructure&#13;
brings substantial new private investments by households, particularly in kitchens and bathrooms.&#13;
Due to the nature of the investment program, the project is expected to have net positive&#13;
environmental consequences.&#13;
A. Poverty bnpact and Other Benefits&#13;
5.2       Upgrading basic infrastructure is expected to produce high benefit levels for several&#13;
reasons. First, households would decide what services they want based on their needs and ability&#13;
to pay. This would help to ensure that highly-valued projects are undertaken, and that these&#13;
projects would be maintained and operated so as to produce a long stream of benefits. Second,&#13;
upgrading would be relatively easy to target on low-income households because the poor are more&#13;
likely than higher-income households to occupy inadequately-serviced areas. The impact of&#13;
upgrading would be greatest for households with the poorest initial living conditions. Finally, the&#13;
stream of benefits would be intensified because of cultural factors which cause women and children&#13;
in the province to spend large amounts of time in and around their residences. Complementary&#13;
health education programs would improve the utilization of infrastructure and maximize the return&#13;
from infrastructure investments.&#13;
5.3       Depending on the mix of components (e.g., water supply, drainage, improved access,&#13;
sanitation, etc.), upgrading produces a wide range of benefits, some of which are more easily&#13;
quantified than others.  Because the community would determine the mix of infrastructure&#13;
components, and because the impact of any given investment would depend on a number of key&#13;
factors such as the existing level of services and population density, it is difficult to make precise&#13;
estimates of benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of the benefits typically associated with the various&#13;
physical components that are commonly included in upgrading projects can be described.&#13;
5.4       Health improvements would be the primary benefits derived from improved water&#13;
supply, drainage, solid waste disposal, and sanitation facilities. Improved health results from both&#13;
increased quantity and quality of water, and in rural areas, easier access to water. Drainage&#13;
prevents the accumulation of used water, which is a source of disease, groundwater contamination,&#13;
and a breeding ground for mosquitos. The collection and disposal of solid waste improves air&#13;
quality and the residential environment, and prevents drains and sewers from clogging. Improved&#13;
sanitation facilities result in safer disposal of excreta, possibly more frequent use of facilities by&#13;
women, and less contamination of drinking water supplies.&#13;
5.5       Electricity, gas, and improved access provide indirect health benefits. Electricity can&#13;
be used for security lighting and can power water pumps. Gas provides a relatively clean fuel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
source for cooking and heating. Access improvements may result in safer roads, footpaths, and&#13;
bridges.&#13;
5.6       In addition to alleviating some of the symptoms of poverty, upgrading could, to an&#13;
extent, directly reduce poverty by increasing productivity and income generation.  Higher&#13;
productivity could result from better health and time savings, the latter coming from less time spent&#13;
collecting water and less time spent maintaining dwellings (e.g., buildings previously needing&#13;
frequent repair due to poor drainage). Improved services could make some types of home-based&#13;
businesses possible, and could stimulate investment in the housing stock, which could include space&#13;
for home-based businesses and rental units.&#13;
5.7       Equity considerations must be taken into account in addition to the health, productivity,&#13;
and economic benefits described above. The project would help narrow the gap in services between&#13;
the rich and poor. Women and children are the primary beneficiaries of infrastructure upgrading;&#13;
these are the groups which are suffering the most from poor living conditions.&#13;
B. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.8       There are no major environmental problems anticipated for this project, which has&#13;
received a B rating under the IDA's Environmental Assessment Operational Guidelines. The&#13;
Community Infrastructure component is designed to improve the living environment for urban and&#13;
rural low-income communities, and accordingly the overall environmental impact of the proposed&#13;
works would be beneficial. Communities would be required when preparing CAPs to choose (with&#13;
technical guidance from PIUs) environmentally sound project components or combinations of&#13;
components (e.g., on-site sanitation would not be an option if it would degrade ground water used&#13;
for drinking). Scheme approval would be contingent upon satisfying environmental and health&#13;
criteria meeting IDA's requirements. Environmental Impact Assessments have been prepared for&#13;
Phase 1 sites and are available in the project file.&#13;
5.9       Improved water supply, although aggravating the wastewater disposal problem, would&#13;
provide significant health benefits by rehabilitating distribution lines which are currently old,&#13;
leaking and located in drainage channels with a high risk of pollution given the intermittent nature&#13;
of supply and low pressure. The quantities of water produced would be such that on-site disposal&#13;
through leaching latrines would generally still be acceptable. Improvements in storm water&#13;
drainage facilities, by reconstructing or lining channels, would decrease the occurrence of stagnant&#13;
water, with resultant improvements in community health. Solid waste management would improve&#13;
both collection and disposal, including by providing additional storage (containerization) facilities&#13;
and, where appropriate, local transportation (handcarts) for community operation. The incidence&#13;
of refuse spreading from uncontrolled heaps through wind and animals would be reduced and there&#13;
would be less need to resort to dumping refuse in drains and watercourses. The disposal of sullage&#13;
and sewage in storm drains is of particular concern and would be addressed not only by the&#13;
establishment of an on-plot sanitation program and health and hygiene education but, in addition,&#13;
for two larger communities, pre-treatment ponds would be established on a pilot basis to pre-treat&#13;
dry weather flows. It is expected that this will assist GONWFP in framing a coherent wastewater&#13;
treatment policy for smaller settlements for the future. The access roads, minor streets and&#13;
footpaths components would also have an environmental benefit by reducing the number of potholes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
and un-reinstated utility trenches which often result in stagnant pools of dirty water and creation&#13;
of mud during the rainy seasons, and clouds of suspended dust in dry seasons. The project would&#13;
place a special emphasis on O&amp;M, with communities participating in the agreement of O&amp;M&#13;
arrangements, including O&amp;M financing, prior to investments being made.&#13;
5.10      No resettlement is required for the 20 schemes for which detailed designs have been&#13;
prepared. Resettlement refers to any loss of shelter, land place of work or other major assets upon&#13;
which a person's livelihood depends. Due to the relatively small scale of the investments at the site&#13;
level, it is not anticipated that any resettlement would be required under the project. In case&#13;
resettlement does, however, arise in the sites remaining to be prepared, or as a result of Phase I&#13;
scheme design changes, GOP confirmed at negotiations that if there are any persons displaced or&#13;
to be displaced as a result of the acquisition of any land required for the purposes of the project or&#13;
any scheme included in the project, such persons shall be compensated and/or resettled in&#13;
accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Association, providing, among other things, for:&#13;
(a) full consultation with the affected persons; (b) provision of equivalent or better accommodation&#13;
at equal or lower cost and maintenance of the standard of living; and (c) assistance in moving (para.&#13;
6.1).&#13;
5.11      Training provided through the project would include a focus on teaching project staff&#13;
how  to increase environmental awareness among the community, and how  to improve&#13;
communication between the community, project staff, and environmental agency staff.&#13;
Environmental and health awareness would be developed during the early stages of community&#13;
mobilization.&#13;
5.12      The project would require coordination with ongoing and proposed planning and&#13;
environmental initiatives. For example, federal and provincial institutions with environmental&#13;
responsibilities such as conducting environmental impact assessments and planning are to be&#13;
strengthened through the ongoing Environmental Protection and Resource Conservation Project&#13;
(Credit 2383-PAK). Coordination would be effected through the Steering Committee, which&#13;
includes the agencies concerned.&#13;
C. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.13      The economic analysis of the infrastructure upgrading was carried out by estimating&#13;
the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and net present value NPV of the benefit and cost&#13;
flows. Costs include the base cost of investment in physical infrastructure with provision for&#13;
overhead costs. Economic costs have been estimated by applying a conversion factor to the costs&#13;
to capture the divergence between the shadow and market prices of different inputs.&#13;
5.14      Society's value of infrastructure upgrading is seen in terms of a "catch-all" measure,&#13;
the resulting increase in land values. This measure reflects the benefits arising from environmental&#13;
improvements in quality of life as well as consumer welfare gains from enhancements in service&#13;
levels. Research conducted during project preparation indicates that infrastructure provision can&#13;
increase plot values in Pakistan by as much as 50% to 150%. This research involves comparing&#13;
areas with little infrastructure to those with fairly complete infrastructure and may, therefore,&#13;
overstate the benefits that would accrue to project communities where rudimentary infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
would exist. Accordingly, the EIRR and NPV of the investment are conservatively estimated&#13;
assuming property value increases of 20% to 25%.&#13;
5.15      Results of the economic analysis, described in greater detail in Annex 13, reveal that&#13;
an increase in plot values of about 21 % will yield an EIRR of approximately 31 %. Net benefits&#13;
are negative when plot values only increase by about 15%. Taking the case where plot values&#13;
increase by about 21% as the "base case", sensitivity analysis reveals that the NPV remains positive&#13;
(using a 30% discount rate) after reducing the average plot value before improvements from Rs&#13;
60,000 to Rs 55,000, or increasing the base costs by 10%. The EIRR in these two alternative&#13;
scenarios drops to 18.5% and 19.5%, respectively. The NPV remains positive even after&#13;
increasing base costs by 20%.&#13;
D. Risks&#13;
5.16      The main risk concerns the success or failure of the community based approach.&#13;
Communities may lack sufficient confidence in government to want to become involved in, and&#13;
contribute financially to, the project; or government may lack the skills, motivation and capacity&#13;
to involve communities fully in project schemes. A further risk could be that, despite perceiving&#13;
the project's benefits, communities would opt to wait for an alternative government infrastructure&#13;
scheme offered on a "no cost" basis. Any of these possible outcomes could generate pressures to&#13;
revert to more traditional arrangements with limited participation. To alleviate these risks, the&#13;
project would incorporate the following measures and actions. First, the project builds on the&#13;
experiences gained through pilot operations. Second, these pilot schemes and retroactively-financed&#13;
continuation works would be used to demonstrate and publicize the success of the approach.&#13;
Development of a community liaison capacity, staff training, involvement of UNICEF, close and&#13;
continuous monitoring by the Steering Committee and external supervision would support the&#13;
government's attempt to apply the participative approach.  The project would allow new&#13;
communities to be selected in place of any which eventually proved unwilling to participate, or&#13;
which failed to qualify through, for example, insufficient contribution for the investments or&#13;
inadequate O&amp;M of earlier works. Conversely, priority would be given to communities which&#13;
were more prepared to contribute financially or were better organized.&#13;
5.17      Further risks are that parts of the community may dominate decision-making, or that&#13;
other parts (for example, women) may be under-represented. Community liaison staff would be&#13;
sensitized to these risks, and female liaison staff would be engaged to ensure women's opinions&#13;
were taken into account. The project is specifically designed to address the traditional risk of&#13;
failure to sustain the benefits of infrastructure due to inadequate O&amp;M practices, but difficulties are&#13;
to be anticipated in introducing the new approach.&#13;

NWFP COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NHA STRENGTHENING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT - DETAILED DESCRIPTION&#13;
OVERVIEW&#13;
1.         The project would comprise three components in support of low income communities. The&#13;
major component is Community Infrastructure, which has a total base cost of about US$28.7 million or&#13;
90% of the project total. It includes three sub-components:&#13;
(a)  Infrastructure Upgrading;&#13;
(b)   Community Development; and&#13;
(c)   Design and Implementation Assistance.&#13;
2.         The other project component is the Institutional Development, including sub-components&#13;
for the Local Government, Elections and Rural Development Department (LGERDD) and the National&#13;
Housing Authority (NHA).&#13;
A. INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADING (TOTAL BASE COST US$ 21.5 MILLION - 56%)&#13;
3.         The major component of the project is the upgrading of infrastructure in approximately 55&#13;
urban and rural communities. This would be implemented in three phases. Detailed design have been&#13;
prepared for 18 Phase I communities. An additional 27 communities (approximately 1830 ha, 208,000&#13;
population and average density of 114 persons/ha) have been identified for Phase 2 of the project and&#13;
limited funding will also be included for additional conmmunities (Phase 3 - approximately 8 sites up to&#13;
about 540 ha).&#13;
4.         The Community Infrastructure component would be demand driven, with the infrastructure&#13;
to be provided according to the priorities of the respective communities. The fundamental concept of the&#13;
project is to foster a sense of ownership of the infrastructure on the part of the communities. Giving&#13;
communities choice and a voice in what is proposed is intended to encourage communities to contribute&#13;
financially to the investments they choose, and to take greater responsibility for their operation and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
5.         Appropriate functional standards for planning, design, and construction have been developed&#13;
taking cognisance of locally available materials, ease of construction and maintenance, and affordability&#13;
(See Annex 7). Affordability and a balanced provision of infrastructure have also been important&#13;
objectives in the design process, although the project allows communities to choose from a range of&#13;
alternative standards within cost ceilings. Another important objective of the process is to improve&#13;
operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), and communities would be required to agree to satisfactory O&amp;M&#13;
arrangements prior to selecting any specific infrastructure scheme (See Annex 8).&#13;
6.         The final composition of the project would only be known after each community has&#13;
prepared its Community Action Plan, and this has been reviewed and modified to conform with technical,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

financial and other agreed criteria. This process, following the establishment of CBOs and their&#13;
participation in the planning and design process carried out by PMU and its consultants, has been&#13;
completed up to detailed engineering design for the 14 Phase IA communities. For purposes of costing&#13;
the project, the total base costs1' for each sectoral sub-component have been determined and then&#13;
expressed on an areal basis (Rs/ha). The areal costs (Rs.181,000 per ha) of a balanced package of&#13;
primary, secondary and tertiary infrastructure (including on-plot sanitation) have then been applied to&#13;
Phase IB, Phase 2 and Phase 3 schemes to extrapolate total costs. Average base costs (January 1994&#13;
prices) for the whole component are estimated at about Rs 172000 per/ha. A summary of the coverage,&#13;
population served, densities and total costs is set out in Table 1 below.&#13;

Note: Costs include trunk, secondary and tertiary infrastructure but exclude land, and total&#13;
base costs are equivalent to Rs.677.3 million in estimated January 1995 prices. Numbers&#13;
are rounded.&#13;
Selection of Priorities&#13;
7.         The priorities of the communities surveyed in Phase 1 were generally as follows:&#13;
(a)   water supply;&#13;
(b)   drainage;&#13;
(c)   access; and&#13;
(d)   solid waste containerisation.&#13;
8.         The order of priority differed amongst these elements from community to community and,&#13;
in a few cases, other priorities featured (e.g., flood protection works). Sanitation facilities and practices&#13;
in the communities surveyed have been reported as poor, and yet demand for sanitation facilities (e.g.&#13;
latrines) has rarely featured in the lists of community priorities. This may imply that the survey process&#13;
may have been too limited resulting in a narrow range of community infrastructure demands. During&#13;
the implementation of Phase 1 and in designing subsequent project phases, community liaison and&#13;
preparation activities will emphasize the possibility of other infrastructure elements being included, and&#13;
also fully explain the advantages and opportunities the project offers to improve health and sanitation (s-e&#13;

- 40 -                               ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
9.          Possible further choices of infrastructure facilities could, subject to prior community&#13;
agreement to satisfactory O&amp;M arrangements, include:&#13;
(a)   infrastructure provision that supports local economic activities (e.g., market stalls, bus&#13;
stands);&#13;
(b)   provision of SUI gas, where primary facilities are available;&#13;
(c)   basic security (street) lighting; and&#13;
(d)   provision of community facilities such as community halls.&#13;
10.         Primary education and primary health facilities are available through a number of other&#13;
programs, and the first consideration would be to seek such facilities from these alternative sources&#13;
(principally due to the need to provide for continuing, relatively high, recurrent costs, and to coordinate&#13;
with province-wide sector and development policies and plans).&#13;
Trunk Infrastructure (Total Base Cost US$ 8.1 million - 21 %)&#13;
11.         Trunk infrastructure includes off-site infrastructure and that infrastructure serving the&#13;
community at large. It would include, for example:&#13;
(a)   tubewells, bulk water transmission, storage and distribution;&#13;
(b)   sewage and drainage pumping stations, collector channels, sewage treatment ponds;&#13;
(c)   solid waste transfer stations and landfill sites; and&#13;
(d)   access roads.&#13;
12.         Consistent with Government policies in NWFP (and for virtually all public infrastructure&#13;
supply in Pakistan), communities would not contribute directly to trunk infrastructure costs. These would&#13;
be financed through general government revenues. Trunk infrastructure required to allow secondary and&#13;
tertiary infrastructure to function would need to be in place prior to implementing project-financed&#13;
secondary/tertiary investments. The project includes a component for such infrastructure, which is&#13;
subject to an assessment of technical and economic feasibility if costs exceed a threshold amount. Subject&#13;
to this requirement, once a community has determined a service to be a priority, the development of any&#13;
required trunk infrastructure could commence directly, and be undertaken in parallel with community&#13;
mobilization, development and resource mobilization activities.&#13;
Water Supplv Local Infrastructure (Total Base Cost US$ 1.3 million - 3%)&#13;
13.         Water in rural areas is supplied by various means including standposts, handpumps, wells&#13;
as well as through individual or shared house connections. In larger communities and urban or peri-urban&#13;
areas tubewells and reservoirs, constructed and operated by PHED, serve the distribution systems. In&#13;
some cases water is supplied direct from rivers through gravity systems. In urban areas where a piped&#13;
supply system exists the distribution systems are often surface laid, routed along and across drainage&#13;
channels and often submerged in polluted water. These pipes are prone to damage and with intermittent&#13;
supply systems, low pressures and faulty equipment, contamination of the water supply is a risk.&#13;
14.          Rehabilitation of distribution systems as well as augmentation, generally to serve house&#13;
connections, will thus be a major sub-component of the project which will also improve necessary trunk&#13;
facilities (see above) such as tubewell and pump rehabilitation/replacement where critical. Potability of&#13;
drinking water, especially when supplied direct from river sources, would be checked and remedial&#13;
measures taken as appropriate.&#13;

Drainage Local Infrastructure (Total Base Cost US$ 3.9 million - 10%)&#13;
15.        Few formal stormwater drains (open channels) exist in selected communities and where they&#13;
have been constructed they are often in poor condition having lacked any regular cleaning or periodic&#13;
maintenance. Invariably the stormwater drains act as sullage and sewage carriers, conveying their&#13;
contents either to main watercourses, to open areas or to fields for irrigation. In response to conmmunity&#13;
demands, comprehensive open channel stormwater drainage systems to be constructed as trapezoidal or&#13;
rectangular channels in either brick or concrete have been designed for all communities. System designs&#13;
have allowed for the fact that sullage will continue to be discharged to the drains for the foreseeable&#13;
future.&#13;
Sanitation Local Infrastructure (Total Base Cost US$ 2.7 million - 7%)&#13;
16.        Although sanitation is not an initial community priority, surveys and meetings with women's&#13;
community organisations showed that the sector requires urgent intervention. A sanitation component has&#13;
therefore been included in the project. The major thrust of the program will be to generate much greater&#13;
conmmunity awareness of sanitation and health linkages, and to improve sanitation practices. The&#13;
experience of UNICEF sanitation programs in NWFP will be drawn upon, particularly in the education&#13;
and training field, and UNICEF will provide partial funding for the software parts of the sub-component.&#13;
17.        The physical elements of the sanitation program to be established under the project will have&#13;
two main parts - incentives for on-plot sanitation and, on a pilot basis, pre-treatment ponds in two urban&#13;
or peri-urban communities where sewerage systems exist. The on-plot sanitation program will generally&#13;
be consistent with the UNICEF program, which has shown that incentives are needed to encourage&#13;
householders to install appropriate toilet facilities. It is envisaged that, generally, double pit pour-flush&#13;
latrines will be installed (most households either already have, or will have during the course of the&#13;
project, an adequate water supply), where space is available, to designs approved by or provided by the&#13;
PMU. The estimated cost of the sub-structure and slabs for such a facility is estimated at Rs.4000 (US$&#13;
133) and it is proposed that 25% of the approved cost of the facility will be granted to the beneficiary&#13;
in stages of its completion. The sub-component would aim to cover approximately 30% of households.&#13;
The success of the sub-component will be dependent on the effectiveness of the health awareness and&#13;
sanitation education sub-component.&#13;
18.        Although desirable for health and environmental reasons, providing appropriate treatment&#13;
facilities for the dry weather discharges from the storm drainage systems is not considered affordable at&#13;
this time, as flows from many communities are small, stormwater discharges at a number of places, and&#13;
efforts are being made under the program to reduce the sullage content of such discharges through the&#13;
on-plot sanitation component. However it is considered important to begin to focus on sewage treatment,&#13;
certainly in larger urban or peri-urban communities, and thus in two of the larger conmmunities where&#13;
there are high concentrations of sullage and sewage discharging from the stormwater drains, pre-treatment&#13;
ponds would be constructed on a pilot basis to partially treat the polluted wastewater, and a program to&#13;
monitor their operation would be established.  This would assist GONWFP in framing a future&#13;
wastewater treatment strategy for smaller communities in the Province.&#13;
Access and Circulation Local Infrastructure (Total Base Cost US$ 5.3 million - 14%)&#13;
19.        In rural areas, access is provided through a network of narrow, generally unpaved paths,&#13;
little more than a car's width across, sometimes flanked on one or both sides by open ditches. The main&#13;
forms of traffic are hand or animal drawn carts and bicycles, as well as animals. The main access roads&#13;
to urban settlements are more integrated with the town's road network and generally paved, although&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -                               ANNEX I&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
often lacking maintenance. The network of roads and footpaths within urban settlements are similar to&#13;
those in rural areas although carrying significantly more traffic.&#13;
20.        Improvements within the programme are limited to paving of existing streets and footpaths.&#13;
Appropriate functional planning, design and construction standards are to be used (See Annex 7). The&#13;
materials proposed in road and footpath construction generally reflect locally used construction material,&#13;
such as bricks. Concrete is used in steep slope locations and where storm water flows are significant.&#13;
Asphalt or double surface dressing will only be used for access roads and wider streets.&#13;
Solid Waste Management Local Infrastructure (Total Base Cost US$ 0.2 million - 1 %)&#13;
21.        In rural areas, solid as well as human and animal waste is disposed of in "derans" (for&#13;
compost) and, to a much larger extent, dropped or dumped in drains, outside the doors in the streets or&#13;
on parcels of open land between houses. The amount of domestic waste generated in urban areas is&#13;
significantly more and less suitable for re-use than in rural areas. Only the largest towns have a central&#13;
system of solid waste management, with collection from the roadside, but often with inappropriate final&#13;
disposal. Low income communities are generally not served in these towns. Under the ADB supported&#13;
Second Urban Development Project (SUDP) solid waste management will be extended and improved in&#13;
all major towns in NWFP.&#13;
22.        Brick-built containers (collection points) primarily intended to reduce the spread of refuse&#13;
by wind and animals will be constructed, and coverage has been designed to appropriate and consistent&#13;
planning standards. Where sites are not forthcoming from the community, consideration will be given&#13;
to the siting of the collection points on footpaths and minor streets, where space permits. Purchase of&#13;
land for collection points sites is not likely to be necessary in view of this and the fact that communities&#13;
have generally agreed to provide sites (approximately 4 sq.m. each). However, where this proves&#13;
unavoidable, land may be purchased. Allowances for land acquisition in the project costs are sufficient&#13;
to cover this eventuality. Local transportation (hand or animal drawn carts) needs in urban areas will also&#13;
be provided as necessary.&#13;
B. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT (TOTAL BASE COST US$ 1.5 MILLION - 4%)&#13;
23.        Community Development would consist of three sub-components as shown below:&#13;
(a)   Community Mobilization/Capacity Building (Total Base Cost US$ 0.4 million - 1%). The&#13;
project would support the following software activities to mobilize the community and to&#13;
build capacity at the community level:&#13;
(i)  Awareness/orientation campaigns (media, materials and hand outs). This would&#13;
include development of Information Education and Communication (IEC) materials&#13;
and mass media campaigns in order to familiarize various Government departments,&#13;
local institutions and communities on the objectives of the project, its policy,&#13;
approach and implementation strategy. Prospective targets for the campaigns include&#13;
the staff of PMU, CLU, PIU, LGERDD, PHED, Local Councils, WAPDA and other&#13;
line agencies likely to be involved in the Project, communities, NGOs, consultants,&#13;
welfare organizations and CBOs. More than 50% of total population of the project&#13;
communities (of which 50% female) would be served by this component.&#13;
(ii) Capacity building/meetings/CBO training. This would include mobilization, capacity&#13;
building, organization and formation of CBOs which would then prepare, plan,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -                           ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
implement and manage their own infrastructure development programs,&#13;
complementary non-formal education (with specific reference to women's education)&#13;
and women's savings and credit funds.  It would include assistance to help&#13;
households access existing home improvement loans schemes. Over 16,000 members&#13;
of CBOs (40% female) are to be oriented, trained and assigned various tasks.&#13;
(iii)  Documentation (slides, videos, case studies).  As the approach, strategy and&#13;
implementation mechanism is innovative, it is necessary to document processes,&#13;
analyze successes and bottlenecks, identify remedial actions and disseminate results.&#13;
This component will provide resources, equipment, materials, logistics and other&#13;
arrangements to monitor, record, analyze and prepare reports on various important&#13;
activities; to prepare case studies on the findings including video and slides; and to&#13;
arrange for dissemination within the province and outside.&#13;
(iv) Needs assessment/CAP meetings. This would include resources, survey materials,&#13;
equipment and logistics for carrying out community needs assessment, including&#13;
participatory rapid appraisals, household surveys and Community Action Planning&#13;
(CAP) meetings.&#13;
(v) Cross visits/observation tours. This would include provision for inter community&#13;
observation and study tours for members of CBOs, NGOs, PIU and Government&#13;
departments. In selected cases, project members may visit similar projects in other&#13;
provinces and other countries in the region. About 7,000 participants are expected&#13;
to benefit from this activity.&#13;
(vi) Action research. This would include research on key topics including development&#13;
and testing of participatory monitoring and evaluation systems, setting up a&#13;
systematic learning system, and refinement of institutional options for effective,&#13;
efficient and sustainable Project implementation.&#13;
(b)   Health &amp; Hygiene Awareness Campaign Program (Total Base Cost US$ 0.8 million - 2%).&#13;
This component would include provision for information and awareness campaigns to assist&#13;
women and communities to organize, identify, and solve existing health and hygiene related&#13;
problems. Program delivery would be through participatory (face to face) and promotional&#13;
(mass media, social marketing) methods including development of training materials,&#13;
modules and hand outs. The program would include orientation and training workshops for&#13;
health staff, LHVs, TBAs and PIU staff; youth school programs and cleanliness drives;&#13;
production of video films, slides and other materials; and Knowledge Attitude Practice&#13;
(KAP) studies.&#13;
(c)   Support for Women and Young Children (Total Base Cost US$ 0.3 million - 1 %) . This&#13;
component would include action research through gender analysis on community education&#13;
and socio economic aspects of women in three selected commnunities, before wider-scale&#13;
implementation. It would incorporate detailed planning of activities, pilot implementation,&#13;
CBO capacity building, and skill training. Implementation of pilot skill and livelihood&#13;
development activities would be monitored and evaluated. The project would work in close&#13;
coordination with the Women Division, NWFP office. The project would finance a female&#13;
WID officer in each of the three sites for 18-24 months to assist womens groups and&#13;
individuals.&#13;

C. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE (US$ 5.7 MILLION - 15%)&#13;
24.         For design purposes and to assist with implementing the project, Government would engage&#13;
Consultants, contract staff and NGOs in addition to appointing incremental staff. 'The role of government&#13;
staff would be primarily management and coordination, with contract/NGO staff c-rrying out most of the&#13;
work in the commnunities. This component therefore comprises consultant and contract/NGO services,&#13;
and establishing Conimunity Infrastructure sections within the Project Management Unit in Peshawar and&#13;
Project Implementation Units.&#13;
Technical Assistance (Total Base Cost US$ 2.4 million - 6%)&#13;
25.         Consultants' services for: a) assistance with community mobilization, community&#13;
development, and infrastructure planning, including liaison with UNICEF, creating awareness within&#13;
comnnunities of health and hygeine, and advancing the role of women in local development; b) detailed&#13;
engineering design including engineering drawings, technical specifications and tender documentation;&#13;
c) implementation support including participation in contract award, administration and supervision,&#13;
overall management and engineering guidance, quality control, defining and establishing satisfactory&#13;
O&amp;M procedures; d) assistance in establishing systems and procedures for, inter alia, project&#13;
management, procurement, reporting, project accounting, management of project finances, project&#13;
evaluation; and e) training of PMU staff and communities as appropriate. The consultants will also&#13;
provide social organizers (to supplement the 14 government social organizers) and will meet the expenses&#13;
of community motivators.&#13;
Other Implementation Support (Total Cost US$ 3.3 million - 9%)&#13;
26.         The establishment, equipping and operation of Community Infrastructure sections within the&#13;
Project Management Unit in Peshawar and Project Implementation Units, mostly located at Divisional&#13;
Headquarters. All costs are being treated as project investment costs (i.e. salaries and allowances of&#13;
Government staff, recurrent operating costs and equipment); however only staff costs, vehicles,&#13;
equipment and training would be eligible for IDA Credit financing equivalent to approximately the first&#13;
two years total expenditure. Staff (Grade 16 and above) are allowed for the followinge:&#13;

NWFP COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NHA STRENGTHENING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES&#13;
1.           The Community Infrastructure Project (CIP) upgrading component will be&#13;
implemented by the Local Government Elections &amp; Rural Development Department (LGERDD) with&#13;
the assistance of the Project Management Unit (PMU) of the Provincial Urban Development Board&#13;
(PUDB). The National Housing Authority (NHA) will implement its institutional development&#13;
technical assistance. The PMU will be responsible for the day-to-day activities of the infrastructure&#13;
upgrading project component, and for this purpose the Director General of the PMU will report&#13;
directly to the Secretary LGERDD. Figure 1 shows the organizational structure for the upgrading&#13;
component.&#13;
2.           Project Steering and Working Committees. Overall policy guidance, approval of&#13;
individual community schemes, inter-agency coordination and monitoring of progress would be the&#13;
responsibility of a project Steering Committee. The Secretary LGERDD will chair the Committee,&#13;
which will meet at least quarterly, and will comprise the following membership:&#13;
Secretary LGERDD - Chairman; Secretary Public Health Engineering Department (PHED);&#13;
Secretary Physical Planning and Housing Department (PP&amp;H); Additional Secretary Finance;&#13;
Additional Secretary LGERDD; Additional Secretary Planning, Environment and&#13;
Development Department; and Director General PMU - Secretary.&#13;
3.           The Steering Committee will appoint a Working Committee for day-to-day&#13;
coordination and monitoring. This will include coordination within PMU, especially between&#13;
community mobilization, engineering and community development activities, liaison with line&#13;
departments and local councils, monitoring implementation performance, identification of actions to&#13;
address implementation bottlenecks, etc. The Additional Secretary LGERDD will chair the&#13;
Committee, which will meet at least once in two weeks, and will comprise the following membership:&#13;
Additional Secretary LGERDD - Chairman; Director Design and Implementation (CIP);&#13;
Director Planning and Community Development (PMU); Deputy Director Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation; and Deputy Director Finance (PMU) - Secretary.&#13;
4.           Local Government Elections &amp; Rural Development Department. The Local&#13;
Government Elections &amp; Rural Development Department (LGERDD) has the overall responsibility for&#13;
implementing the community infrastructure component of the investment. LGERDD has implemented&#13;
various provincial infrastructure development projects under its rural development programmes, but&#13;
has limited prior experience of donor-funded projects. LGERDD is the coordinating and supervising&#13;
agency for the local government system. It is responsible, inter alia, for coordinating with local&#13;
councils which, through their own resources, are responsible for the development, operation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

maintenance of infrastructure facilities within their respective areas. The Department implements a&#13;
number of schemes on behalf of members of the National and Provincial Assemblies (MNA/MPA&#13;
programmes). Its Local Government and Rural Development Department looks after special projects&#13;
and the working of Union Councils in the province. Within the jurisdiction of LGERDD, the Local&#13;
Council Board (LCB) was established in 1984 to serve as facilitator for the human resources and&#13;
training functions for district councils, and for municipal and town committees in NWFP. Over the&#13;
years, there has been a gradual transformation in the role of LCB and it has, in the last two years,&#13;
begun to act as the principal regulatory arm of the LGERDD in respect of affairs of self-financed&#13;
local government institutions in the Province. The organisation chart of LGERDD is presented in&#13;
Figure 2.&#13;
5.           Provincial Urban Development Board. The Provincial Urban Development Board&#13;
(PUDB) is a corporate body that controls the province's Development Authorities. The Government&#13;
of NWFP instructed the Physical Planning and Housing Department (PP&amp;H) to create PUDB in 1974,&#13;
and assigned PUDB the task of: (1) establishing a system of urban planning; (2) integrating physical,&#13;
economic, and social planning at all government levels; and (3) creating an institutional framework&#13;
capable of sustaining these activities.&#13;
6.           Proiect Management Unit. An existing Project Management Unit (PMU) within&#13;
PUDB will be the organizational unit responsible for planning, designing and implementing the&#13;
upgrading component. The PMU was established in 1989 for the Asian Development Bank's Second&#13;
Urban Development Project (SUDP), which is currently underway in seven major NWFP cities. The&#13;
PMU staff consists of employees drawn from PUDB, the LGERDD, and the Public Health&#13;
Engineering Department (PHED). The PMU is responsible for undertaking and coordinating projects&#13;
that exceed the jurisdictions of individual Development Authorities. The PMU has seven Division&#13;
level Project Implementation Units (PIUs), each headed by a Deputy Director, and within these PIUs&#13;
a cell would be created for CIP. The staff responsible for the CIP in each PIU would include: an&#13;
Assistant Director, an accountant, a sub-engineer, a draftsman and a Social Organizer Coordinator.&#13;
Several key PMU personnel, including the DG, the Personnel and Administration Superintendent,&#13;
PIU Deputy Directors, and PIU accountants will be responsible for both the CIP and the SUDP. All&#13;
other CIP staff will not have dual responsibilities to ensure that they will be able to devote their full&#13;
attention to the CIP.&#13;
7.           Although the PMU is created under the Physical Planning and Housing Department,&#13;
the Government of NWFP has directed the PMU to report to the Secretary LGERDD for the purposes&#13;
of this project. The DG PMU oversees the day-to-day operations of the program and is responsible&#13;
for coordinating the actions of the Director Planning and Community Development, Director Design&#13;
and Implementation, Deputy Director Finance, Deputy Director Monitoring and Evaluation, and&#13;
Personnel and Administration Superintendent.&#13;
8.           The Planning and Community Development Director has the overall responsibility for&#13;
community involvement in identifying infrastructure and community development needs and priorities.&#13;
This will include building up community organizations, creating awareness within communities of&#13;
health, hygiene and environment, site selection, socio-economic and topographical surveys, needs&#13;
assessment and conceptual design, initial costing and assessment of affordability of infrastructure.&#13;
The Director is also responsible for advancing the role of women in the project-assisted development,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

and for coordination with UNICEF. He is assisted by a Community Development Deputy Director&#13;
and a Planning Deputy Director. Planning and Community Development staff will work with Social&#13;
Organizer Coordinators and Implementation Assistant Directors at the Division PIU level as&#13;
appropriate. The Design and Implementation Director has overall responsibility for preparation of&#13;
engineering designs, bills of quantities, cost estimates, and basic procurement documentation.&#13;
Through PIUs, the Director will be involved in procuring works, contract management and&#13;
administration, supervising construction, and helping communities to plan and prepare for operation&#13;
and maintenance. His two Deputy Directors for Implementation Coordination will work with&#13;
Implementation Assistant Directors and Sub-Engineers at the PIU level.&#13;
9.           The Finance Deputy Director, assisted by the Accounts Assistant Director and Audit&#13;
Assistant Director, is responsible for all project accounting and internal auditing, and will manage the&#13;
special account. The Finance staff will work with the PIU accountants and the community to develop&#13;
accounting systems at the community and divisional level, and to establish procedures for paying&#13;
contractors, managing community project accounts, and budgeting. Government accounts will be&#13;
audited by the Auditor General Pakistan. Commercial auditors will audit communities' accounts.&#13;
10.          The Deputy Director, Monitoring and Evaluation will be responsible for preparing&#13;
routine monitoring reports, including monitoring key performance indicators. He will also be&#13;
responsible for initiating and managing community-based evaluation and impact assessments.&#13;
11.          Social Welfare Department and Women's Division. PMU, through the Directorate of&#13;
Planning and Community Development, will maintain close liaison with the Social Welfare&#13;
Department and the Women's Division. The Social Welfare Department's responsibilities include:&#13;
training and rehabilitation of the handicapped, orphans, widows, and the destitute; women's welfare;&#13;
and relief during natural calamities. The department sponsors projects such as community centers and&#13;
industrial homes, and is responsible for promoting the formation of community organizations and for&#13;
registering NGOs. The Women's Division's activities have focused on basic studies and programme&#13;
formulation in the areas of adult education, literacy, health, nutrition, agricultural extension, and skill&#13;
training. The Division, which is totally dependent on federal funding, has helped establish a number&#13;
of NGOs, social welfare organizations, and multi-purpose community centers.&#13;
12.          National Housing Authority. The National Housing Authority (NHA) was created as&#13;
an arm of the Ministry of Housing and Works in 1987 to address the growing housing shortage in&#13;
Pakistan. A major purpose of NHA is to advise on policy matters. It is regulated by a Board of&#13;
Governors, headed by the Prime Minister, and has an Executive Committee chaired by the Minister&#13;
Housing and Works. NHA has a Director General, supported by a Deputy Director General,&#13;
Directors and Deputy Directors. The main functions of NHA include: preparing policies and policy&#13;
guidelines; coordinating programs between provinces; research, monitoring and evaluation related to&#13;
the housing sector; mobilizing resources (including from donors); arranging land for housing;&#13;
dissemination of information; and emphasizing the shelter needs of low-income groups.&#13;

NWFP COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NHA STRENGTHENING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - DETAILED PROCEDURES&#13;
1.    PRE-PREPARATION PHASE (3 months)&#13;
1.    Identification. Selection of Project areas: The first stage would be the preparation by the&#13;
PMU through the Directorate Planning and Community Development (P&amp;CD) staff and PIU&#13;
social organizers of the indicative plan to identify potential areas for improvement. This&#13;
would be generally done through a reconnaissance and desk studies of primary and secondary&#13;
information, physical resource data necessary for technical planning and design, socio-&#13;
economic data, etc. The indicative plan would thus define general locations where: (i)&#13;
depressed and low income areas including poverty pockets are located; (ii) physical resources&#13;
are available (land, building space, etc); (iii) there is an apparent need for basic infrastructure&#13;
services, health and hygiene education, and socio-economic programs. The indicative concept&#13;
plan would be the basis to guide the P&amp;CD to organize the formation of the Project&#13;
Committee, and prepare the Community Action Plan (CAP) for funding support.&#13;
2.    Project Initiation. Information to Communities and Local Government Officials: The&#13;
P&amp;CD/PIU would contact the local officials which would be involved in area prioritization&#13;
and establishing initial contact with the comnmnunity to ascertain likely conmnunity response and&#13;
participation. The local authorities together with the community leaders and representatives&#13;
of various community based organizations (CBO) would confirm with the members in their&#13;
areas that upgrading development through government intervention is required and that the&#13;
community and users would be willing, in principle, to accept the responsibilities and costs&#13;
that they would incur if their community was to be served. The indicative plan or tentative&#13;
program would be presented at this stage to the community. A cross-check of likely&#13;
community response would be made by P&amp;CD through review of the operational performance&#13;
of any existing government and private financed facilities (water supply, drainage, toilet,&#13;
cooperatives, savings groups) in the vicinity of the selected areas. During this stage initial&#13;
orientation and motivational activities would be undertaken, with the final output of a written&#13;
request from the community agreeing in principle on responsibilities and a commitment to be&#13;
involved in project planning, implementation and 0 &amp; M responsibilities.&#13;

II.    PARTICIPATORY PLANNING            (6-9 months)&#13;
3.    Needs Assessment. Preparation of Community Action Plan (CAP): This stage starts with a&#13;
needs assessment including: community self survey, affordability analysis, and preparation of&#13;
the community through continuous motivation and leadership training. During this stage the&#13;
community would be required to agree a representative organization and to participate in CBO&#13;
formation efforts. Also the various technology, service level-options and community&#13;
development programs would be presented for choice. This would be followed by the&#13;
preparation of a CAP by the community, with assistance from the P&amp;CD/PIU. The CAP&#13;
would include a package of physical, social, health and hygiene education, and economic skill&#13;
training programs, including an environmental impact assessment. It would cover: (i) CBOs&#13;
organizational structure, project related committees, membership, responsibilities, women's&#13;
groups, registration; (ii) assessment and the locations of areas to be upgraded and&#13;
communities proposed to be developed and assisted; (iii) selected physical (type of&#13;
infrastructure and facility), community development program (socio-economic, healtr .nd&#13;
hygiene education and training) and priorities under which the program would be&#13;
implemented; (iv) an investment plan including costs, showing government and commnunity&#13;
contributions and a time table for resource mobilization; (v) arrangements for collection,&#13;
safekeeping and accounting for the community's contribution; and (vi) an implementation plan&#13;
including arrangements on timing and scheduling for procurement, supervision and monitoring&#13;
and evaluation. The CAP in each community would be developed in two steps:&#13;
Step 1: Confirmation of Community Programs&#13;
A sketch map and a full description would be prepared for each community or&#13;
group of communities showing: (i) the locations of areas and&#13;
housing/structural conditions; (ii) the locations of existing government&#13;
facilities (public water and sanitation facilities, markets, etc); (iii) the locations&#13;
of areas including poverty pockets proposed by local leaders and communities&#13;
for development; and (iv) major population centers and roads. Other&#13;
information required includes the technical and design characteristics of&#13;
existing government facilities, a description of the health situation, socio-&#13;
economic development opportunities, and an affordability analysis for both the&#13;
community and the concerned local councils. Compilation of information&#13;
together with field checking of the community's proposal would permit&#13;
confirmation or modification of an improvement program and definition of the&#13;
type(s) of basic services, infrastructure facilities and other community&#13;
development programs (software activities) to be provided. For developing a&#13;
confirmed program, special attention would be given to use of appropriate&#13;
planning criteria and design standards (e.g., water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities, footpaths, etc.,).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
Step 2: Development of Local Programs&#13;
Once the community improvement program confirmation process is&#13;
completed, these can be assembled, as appropriate, to form a number of sub-&#13;
projects or areas which together form the local program. It will then be&#13;
necessary to decide the priority of developing the sub-project areas, taking&#13;
into account: (i) preparedness and commitment of the community; (ii) the&#13;
location and contracting constraints; and (iii) the necessity to coordinate with&#13;
the other line agencies regarding their programs. The outcome of the&#13;
discussions would be an annual work program for the locality, subject to some&#13;
modifications during the planning and design process for the finally selected&#13;
sub-project areas.&#13;
4.    Detailed Preparation and Planning: Each CAP is further developed to specific physical&#13;
infrastructure, and community development programs. For physical infrastructure, the&#13;
PMU/PIU administers the preparation of the detailed designs, specifications and engineering&#13;
designs including presentation to conmmunity on final designs, confirmation of priorities and&#13;
phasing of infrastructure components for implementation. For community development&#13;
programs (socio-economic health and hygiene education programs), the P&amp;CD/PIU prepares&#13;
the final and detailed programs and arranges the funds. Following the signing of the&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding agreement (MOU) with the community, the technical work on&#13;
design and procurement is prepared.&#13;
5.    The MOU would require the community to: (i) identify specific user groups or associations,&#13;
and their responsibilities including registration; (ii) arrange and provide land or building space&#13;
for a specific purpose (individual/group toilets, water supply, market, income-generating&#13;
activities) as indicated in the CAP; (iii) provide cost shares, including cash contributions to&#13;
capital costs; (iv) provide resources for contract supervision and administration; and (v)&#13;
assume responsibility for O&amp;M management and payments. Similarly, the project agency&#13;
would undertake to: (i) provide its share of finance for the capital costs of basic services and&#13;
programs identified in the CAP; (ii) implement the agreed CAP together with the community;&#13;
(iii) involve the CBO/Project Committee in the design of the specific components; (iv) arrange&#13;
construction of physical infrastructure by private contractor, including as appropriate&#13;
community resources and labor; (v) provide training and technical advice to community&#13;
groups on O&amp;M, management and financing, skill training; (vi) assist establishing appropriate&#13;
arrangements O&amp;M for specific infrastructure (eg., piped water supply), including contractor&#13;
support for a limited period (within one year) prior to handing over of completed facilities;&#13;
and (vii) for line agencies to accept responsibility for major repairs on an exceptional basis&#13;
(major roads, water supply system).&#13;
6.    Community Organization and Development: The organization of the community and the&#13;
different user groups would build on other successful formal and informal user groups,&#13;
supported by local councils and any existing CBOs. The P&amp;CD/PIU would assist the&#13;
community to establish a CBO Project Committee and user groups. The CBO in each&#13;
community (representing the user groups) would make a written request for their&#13;
improvement and agree to form user groups, contribute to construction and take over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M. The PIU would coordinate with the P&amp;CD and would be primarily&#13;
responsible in assisting the CBO in the formation of the user groups.&#13;
7.    During the preparation phase, orientation and participatory training would be carried out by&#13;
P&amp;CD/PIU focussing on: (i) identifying the roles and responsibilities of the CBO and user&#13;
group members with particular focus on women in the development process; (ii) organization&#13;
and registration of the users/associations; (iii) management of the user organizations, finances&#13;
and O&amp;M activities, including operator training for water supply and sanitation facilities; and&#13;
(iv) hygiene and sanitation education and other entry level activities (e.g., skill training, NFE,&#13;
group savings).&#13;
III.   IMPLEMENTATION STAGE (three phases of up to 6-12 months each)&#13;
8.    Implementation of Works: The fourth stage would involve implementation of the CAP in&#13;
each community comprising a package of physical as well as community development&#13;
programs for phased implementation. The implementation of various community development&#13;
programs is at fullest at this stage including O&amp;M training. While the procurement and&#13;
construction rhanagement of the type A (primary infrastructure) and type B (typical secondary&#13;
and tertiary infrastructure) will be the primary responsibility of the project agency,&#13;
involvement of the CBO would be sought during the construction, supervision and&#13;
certification of completion of work phases. For civil works, the PIU prepares the tender&#13;
documents and bidding. A procurement team, including a CBO representative, administers&#13;
the procurement process and awards the contract. The CBO, with technical assistance from&#13;
PIU, supervises the execution works. For type C (simple and small tertiary infrastructure)&#13;
works to be implemented by through community self-help, similar interaction would take&#13;
place including provision of technical advice from PlUs.&#13;
IV.   HANDOVER, O&amp;M, MONITORING STAGE (6-12 months)&#13;
9.     Commissioning of Public Facilities for Handover to User Groups: A rigorous procedure&#13;
would be applied by the PIU together with the concerned government agency for testing the&#13;
operational capability of all completed infrastructure facilities against intended design&#13;
standards before they are handed over to their respective user groups/associations. Any faults&#13;
detected during the testing procedure will be corrected before the handover is made.&#13;
Representatives of the local government units and the CBO will observe the tests.&#13;
10.   Initial O&amp;M Support, Monitoring: After the completion of the facilities, the project staff&#13;
would remain associated with the community for a period of six months to one year to train&#13;
user associations on their management and O&amp;M activities, assist rectify structural works, and&#13;
coordinate community development inputs and support activities being carried by other&#13;
sectoral agencies. The handover period would also involve regular monitoring of the various&#13;
community development programs, functioning of facilities and review of the need for&#13;
modifications or repairs to major structures as requested by the CBO/user groups.&#13;
11.   Long Term O&amp;M Support: After the initial O&amp;M support phase, support to the user groups/&#13;
association would be carried out through the regular local government/line agencies who&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
would continue to monitor functioning and management of the facilities and programs, and&#13;
provide technical guidance on a needs basis.&#13;
12.   Community Development Programs: During this period other socio-economic, health and&#13;
hygiene education activities would continue to take place. These might include, according to&#13;
circumstances and the types of programs offered by other agencies: (i) institutional and other&#13;
incentive schemes which the project, in coordination with the banks, other sectoral agencies,&#13;
NGOs including Unicef may make available; (ii) management and skill training/job&#13;
placement; (iii) arrangements for product marketing, credit programs for home improvements,&#13;
sanitation, productive enterprises, etc; (iv) advice on the advantages and initiatives needed for&#13;
the user groups to avail of group or individual credit; and (v) advice and participation on&#13;
various NFE, business and income-generating skills.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
PLANNING. DESIGN. AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS&#13;
General&#13;
1.         Infrastructure standards and service levels used to plan, design and cost the Project have&#13;
been developed in consultation with selected Phase 1 communities. In developing the standards the&#13;
need to provide effective infrastructure which is affordable, simple and which, for secondary and&#13;
tertiary elements, is able to be easily constructed and subsequently operated and maintained by the&#13;
communities, has been of paramount consideration. The standards and service levels are as follows:&#13;
A. Water Supply&#13;
2.         The source of supply will be springs or tubewells with or without surface or overhead&#13;
reservoirs. All water supplied will be to WHO guidelines for drinking water quality (as adopted by&#13;
PHED). The minimum terminal pressure head will be 8.0 m (rural) and 10 m (urban); maximum&#13;
height of any overhead reservoir will not be more than 20 m.&#13;
3.         Supply standards will be:&#13;
(a)   Minimum supply from public standposts or community tanks/minimum supply level for&#13;
rural settlements.&#13;
Maximum walking distance:    100 m&#13;
Design per capita consumption: 25 lcd&#13;
Storage:                     20% of average daily consumption&#13;
Design peak factor:          1.0 (i.e. no allowance)&#13;
(b)  Improved supply from public standposts or community tanks/target supply level for rural&#13;
settlements and minimum supply level for urban communities.&#13;
Maximum walking distance:    100 m&#13;
Design consumption:          25 lcd (rural), 35 lcd (urban)&#13;
Storage:                     35% of average daily consumption&#13;
Design peak factor:          1.0 (i.e. no allowance)&#13;
(c)  Intermediate level service through yard connections (13 mmn dia pipe from street&#13;
distibutor main); target supply level for urban communities.&#13;
Design consumption:          60 lcd (rural), 75 lcd (urban)&#13;
Storage:                     35% of average daily consumption&#13;
Design peak factor:          1.5&#13;
(d)   Full house connections (13 mm dia pipe from street distibutor main); ideal supply level.&#13;
&#13;

Design Peak factor:           1.5&#13;
4.         Tubewells, trunk lines and reservoirs are considered as primary infrastructure.&#13;
Tubewells will be constructed to regular PHED standards. The main pipeline from the tubewell or&#13;
spring to the reservoir or direct to the community will be constructed with galvanised iron pipes up to&#13;
150mm diameter laid with a cover of between 0.5 and 1.0 metre. The distribution system within&#13;
commuinities will generally be constructed from galvanised iron (25mm to 100 mm dia) pipes&#13;
depending on capacity required with a cover to the top of pipes of generally 0.75 metre.&#13;
B. Sanitation&#13;
5.         The sanitation component will comprise three main elements: (a) a health and sanitation&#13;
awareness program, established with the assistance and cooperation of UNICEF, and concentrating on&#13;
training and health and sanitation education; (b) the establishment of an on-plot sanitation program&#13;
with incentives (equivalent to a 25% matching grant) for households who are prepared to construct an&#13;
oni-plot, pour flush latrine; (c) provision of simple primary treatment facilities (oxidation ponds) in&#13;
areas where there are large concentrations of sewage discharging to watercourses via the stormwater&#13;
drainage network. Particular focus will be given to on-plot sanitation programs where land,&#13;
topography, accepting watercourse and climatic constraints prohibit the provision of a suitable and&#13;
affordable commnunal disposal/treatment facility. Details of the respective elements are set out below.&#13;
6.          Double-pit household pour-flush latrines will be encouraged in all communities provided&#13;
that there is a low groundwater level (at least 2 metres below the underside of the leaching pit), that&#13;
underlying rock is at sufficient depth and tests determine that leaching can take place. The leaching&#13;
pits will be approx 1.0 rnetre dia x 1.4 metre deep as may be determined as a result of tests. In the&#13;
event that there is a poor response to household latrines, community public 4-cubicle dry pit latrines&#13;
will be tested, again provided that there is a low groundwater level and that underlying rock is at&#13;
sufficienit depth. Ownership will be offered to determine acceptability.&#13;
7.         Provision for sullage or grey water will be via the stormdrainage system with acceptable&#13;
outfall arrangements (see D below). Uncontrolled contamination of sullage water by human waste&#13;
should be reduced by the encouragement of on-plot sanitation through improved latrines (see above).&#13;
Sewerage will only be considered in urban areas with high water consumption (&gt; 120 lcd) and high&#13;
population density (&gt; 150 persons/ha). The present level of funding (and community affordability) is&#13;
not likely to allow for sewerage components within the project unless primary infrastructure such as a&#13;
trunk sewer (and associated sewage treatment plant) with adequate spare capacity is available locally&#13;
or if there is a perennial large-flow outfall available. Designs for sewers will provide adequate slope&#13;
to ensure a self-cleansing velocity of 0.6 m/sec once per day and adequate facility for system flushing&#13;
once per week. Any sewerage system augmentation will be constructed with concrete pipes made&#13;
with sulphate resisting cement. Treatment would be considered if land is available for a local area&#13;
stabilisation/oxidation pond or septic tank.&#13;

C. Solid Waste&#13;
8.          Improved solid waste management will be achieved by improved operation and&#13;
maintenance through community-based arrangements. Investment in facilities will likely be small and&#13;
limited to: (a) the construction of open, brick built, collection containers of approximately 7 cubic&#13;
meters capacity; and (b) in rural areas, advice on the location of disposal sites. In rural communities,&#13;
in view of the limited volumes of solid waste remaining to be disposed of (the majority of rural waste&#13;
is recycled), bulk transport will not be necessary. If communities do require periodic haulage they&#13;
will mobilise agricultural tractors and trailers. However, for permanent disposal from urban&#13;
communities, linkage will be made with the city-wide waste collection and disposal systems. (Other&#13;
projects provide solid waste management systems in most of the major towns in NWFP.) Where the&#13;
current disposal arrangements are inadequate, provision of additional waste containerisation facilities&#13;
will be provided. For design purposes, the volumes of solid waste generated in urban areas is based&#13;
on 1.2 litres per person per day and in rural areas, 1.0 litre per day.&#13;
D. Stormwater Drainage&#13;
9.          The minimum requirement is for adequate drainage, in flat or plain areas, to access&#13;
roads, minor streets and footpaths. In general, drains will be provided in the centre of footpaths, and&#13;
on one side or on both sides of roads dependent on need and space availability.&#13;
10.         Design capacity for all channels will take into account a sullage volume equivalent to&#13;
80% of the amount of the potable water supplied and, in addition, for tertiary drains, local rainfall&#13;
run-off. For larger areas, the capacity of primary and secondary drains will be calculated from the&#13;
catchment area and rainfall intensity. Run-off will generally be calculated using a maximum storm&#13;
intensity of 50 mm/hour (for smaller areas) representing a 1-year return period, plus an allowance for&#13;
sullage (diy weather flow).&#13;
11.         Drainage channels will consist of either concrete semi-circular or "V" shaped chalnels&#13;
or rectangular channels of plastered brick on a concrete base and cunette. Where such channels are&#13;
liable to carry sullage water including significant volumes of raw sewage, sulphate resistant cement&#13;
shall be used in the construction. Where possible, drainage gradients will be such as to ensure a self-&#13;
cleansing velocity of 0.6 m/sec at peak flows. Connections from houses will be via small concrete&#13;
surface channels or 75mnm or 100mm pipes. One of four sizes of drains will be constructed (lepending&#13;
on anticipated flow volumes.&#13;
12.         The provision of flood protection works to divert stormwater away from or around a&#13;
community, or, where neither solution is practical, to channel and control flood flows through a&#13;
community, may be included where considered a community priority. Designs will be prepared on a&#13;
case-by-case basis and are expected to involve stone masonry and concrete work.&#13;
E. Roads and Footpaths&#13;
13.         The planned service level target for access and circulation is to provide for all weather&#13;
access to 100% of houses within the communities. Three typologies have been considered, vehicular&#13;
access roads, minor streets and footpaths. The geometric standards for each typology are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
Type A- Vehicular Access Roads: 2.5m width or over;&#13;
Type B- Minor Streets: between 1.5m and 2.5 m width; and&#13;
Type C- Footpaths: less than 1.5m width.&#13;
14.         Alternative construction standards are to be allowed to give the communities a choice.&#13;
In hilly areas where there are steep slopes, concrete surface treatment will be adopted rather than&#13;
brick. Also where soils are found to be weak, a sub-base will be constructed.&#13;
15.        The construction of roads and footpaths within communities will be closely integrated&#13;
with existing drainage or constructed together with proposed drainage.&#13;
G. Street lighting&#13;
16.        In principle the provision of street lighting will only be considered in urban areas and it&#13;
is unlikely to be a component chosen by respective communities (none of the 14 Phase IA&#13;
commuunities chose streetlighting). However, in rural communities, community preference for street&#13;
lighting, based on a perceived priority for reasons of security, may be considered.&#13;
17.         Lighting will be pole-mounted, wall-mounted or mounted on existing power lines at&#13;
strategic points and will not necessarily give full coverage. Lamps will be fluorescent bulbed. Cabling&#13;
between lights will be via ducts set in concrete or overhead.&#13;

PAKISTAN&#13;
NWFP COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NHA STRENGTHENING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
1.           It is a fundamental objective of the project to involve the communities more in the&#13;
operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of the local infrastructure which serves their respective&#13;
communities. This is a thrust of government policy which has recently agreed that rural water supply&#13;
schemes should become a responsibility of the communities to operate and maintain under the&#13;
guidance of the respective District Council.&#13;
2.            Operation and maintenance is presently the responsibility of the local council,&#13;
although in most rural areas little or no maintenance exists other than for water supply schemes&#13;
operated by PHED. Fees and connection charges, where an attempt is made to collect them, do not&#13;
result in revenues sufficient to cover O&amp;M costs.&#13;
3.            Community participation will vary from scheme to scheme and between urban and&#13;
rural areas. O&amp;M activities considered to have potential for community involvement have been&#13;
established for individual infrastructure sub-components and are set out in the attached Table.&#13;
Community cost sharing of the following activities is proposed: a) provision of free labor (to clean&#13;
out drains regularly and keep them clear of blockage); b) payment of tariffs and/or rates which&#13;
adequately cover the costs of system operation (eg electricity supply costs for a tubewell pump); c)&#13;
building up a fund to cover future equipment repair or replacement; and d) collection, banking,&#13;
accounting, and disbursement of O&amp;M funds. To begin with community contributions equate to&#13;
approximately 3 % of household incomes. On completion of the works households in the community&#13;
will continue to make contributions to the CBO for O&amp;M equivalent to an annual payment of 3 % of&#13;
the capital cost of the works provided under the project.&#13;
4.            The "maintenance culture" is not well developed in Pakistan, and accordingly special&#13;
attention is being made to attempt to develop satisfactory mechanisms to involve commnunities in this&#13;
process. Actions would be taken as follows:&#13;
a.     organisation of community user groups for O&amp;M of solid waste collection, cleaning&#13;
of existing drains, and other community facilities (if any) would be undertaken at an&#13;
early stage of the community mobilization process, and communities would&#13;
specifically commit to undertake O&amp;M as part of the process of selecting&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
b.     satisfactory O&amp;M of infrastructure would be considered as a factor when seeking to&#13;
prioritize between communities, and satisfactory O&amp;M of any project-funded&#13;
infrastructure would be a prerequisite for further project infrastructure; and&#13;
c.     establishment of satisfactory O&amp;M arrangements would be stressed as an important&#13;
output from the Design and Implementation Technical Assistance.&#13;

NWFP COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NHA STRENGTHENING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.           Any project with a strong element of community participation requires close&#13;
monitoring. The pilot experience have confirmed that communities have varying abilities to organize&#13;
and manage complex projects. Because it is difficult to anticipate outcomes in this environment, the&#13;
project has been deliberately designed to encourage learning through experience. Feedback obtained&#13;
through monitoring facility performance, community capacity development, and effective facility use&#13;
will be used to improve the system of delivering infrastructure as the project progresses.&#13;
2.           The PMU would establish and maintain project management systems, and undertake&#13;
project monitoring and evaluation covering the design of baseline information to be gathered in each&#13;
CIP site before detailed preparation, and an MIS for project management and performance&#13;
monitoring. The project would have two types of M&amp;E which would be closely coordinated in all&#13;
phases of the development cycle. This include: (i) performance and process monitoring, and (ii)&#13;
impact evaluations. Workshops and sample studies carried out with the assistance of specialists would&#13;
recommend changes in the type, quantity and frequency of data collected, improved information&#13;
gathering and reporting formats, and procedures for data gathering, processing, analysis and&#13;
reporting. Formal biennial reviews, plus a mid-term review, will complement the ongoing monitoring&#13;
and evaluation activities. Impact studies and special process monitoring research would be contracted&#13;
to outside agencies such as NGO/private, Universities, and training institutions, etc. Analysis of&#13;
performance and process indicators will be an essential component of these reviews.&#13;
COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
3.           The project will employ participatory evaluation techniques in addition to more&#13;
traditional evaluation methods. Because the community plays an important role in planning,&#13;
implementing, and using the infrastructure, its input can be valuable in modifying the indicators&#13;
shown below or in identifying additional indicators. Indicators are developed to analyze whether the&#13;
CIP objectives are being achieved, costs, efficiency of organizational procedures and inter-agency&#13;
coordination, quality of project processes and outputs, accessibility to beneficiaries, and replicability.&#13;
The following list is therefore neither exhaustive nor final, but presents model monitoring indicators&#13;
covering key aspects of the project's implementation and outcomes.&#13;
CIP Performance and Process Indicators&#13;
4.           These indicators focus on the adequacy of inputs and outputs at all levels in terms of&#13;
human, financial, implementation and monitoring of sub-projects. It would regularly assess the&#13;
adequacy of functions and services of the different groups of participants involved in terms of their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

NWFP COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NHA STRENGTHENING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT&#13;
1.     Under conservative assumptions about the increase in property values that will result from&#13;
upgrading, the community infrastructure component will yield an economic internal rate of return&#13;
(EIRR) of approximately 31 %. The component will generate positive net present values with discount&#13;
rates exceeding 30% under a variety of plausible scenarios. These results are modestly sensitive to&#13;
assumptions about base costs and initial property values.&#13;
2.     Water, drainage, sanitation, solid waste, and access improvements are expected to provide&#13;
benefits that will be reflected in property values. A project preparation study suggests that, after&#13;
allowing for other factors, infrastructure provision can increase plot values by as much as 50 to 150%.&#13;
Table 1, which is based on data from this study, presents a simple comparison of the prices of serviced&#13;
and unserviced plots for eight cities; the differences range from 20 to 141%, with an average value of&#13;
about 87%. These results should be interpreted cautiously because the study compares areas with little&#13;
or no infrastructure to those with complete infrastructure built to standards that likely exceed those that&#13;
will be used in the proposed program. Table 1 thus overstates the benefits that would accrue to CI&#13;
communities.&#13;

3.    Additional research from around Pakistan supports the theory that upgrading should produce&#13;
higher property values. For example, in a property tax study of Lahore, Slingsby compared changes in&#13;
the dwelling characteristics of an upgraded area to those occurring in an adjacent area that was&#13;
scheduled for upgrading and discovered a sharp increase in the number of kitchens and bathrooms in&#13;
the upgraded area. He attributed this incremental investment, in part, to better access to services (i.e.,&#13;
water supply, sewerage, street surfacing, drainage, solid waste management) [Ernest Slingsby, "Reform&#13;
of Property Taxes," memorandum, no date. p. 4].&#13;
4.    Several researchers have used hedonic analysis to assess the contribution of specific dwelling&#13;
features to rents and dwelling values. Lodhi and Pasha used hedonic analysis to demonstrate, among&#13;
other things, that piped water supply and electricity were positively correlated with rents in katchi&#13;
abadis in Karachi [Akhtar Lodhi and Hafiz Pasha, "Housing Demand in Developing Countries: A Case-&#13;
study of Karachi in Pakistan," Urban Studies, Vol. 28, No. 4, 1991, pp. 623-634]. Similar analyses&#13;
based on data from more cities were carried out by Akbar, who found piped water and piped gas to be&#13;
important contributors to rent. He also found access to a pucca road to be a strong contributor to home&#13;
values (Mohammad Akbar, "Rate of Return to Investment in Housing Attributes," Applied Economics&#13;
Research Centre, University of Karachi, research paper, no date].&#13;
5.    Property values can indicate a willingness to pay for improved health and living conditions;&#13;
however, they may not do a good job of capturing potential indirect benefits such as higher&#13;
productivity from improved health and greater economic activity in the form of home-based businesses.&#13;
No attempt is made here to measure these indirect benefits.&#13;
6.    To obtain a more precise estimate of property values increases, the Table 1 data must be&#13;
adjusted to take into account that Cl communities will: (1) already have an existing level of services;&#13;
(2) use infrastructure standards that are lower than those used in typical sites; and (3) demand slightly&#13;
less than a full package of services. In calculating the EIRR, we assume that plot values in Cl&#13;
communities will increase by not more than 25% of the 87% average increase (i.e., 21.8%) after&#13;
making a 50% allowance for the value of existing services and a 25% allowance for utilization of&#13;
modest standards. We also assume that CI communities will demand on average about 95 % of a full&#13;
upgrading packages. We know that a complete upgrading package utilizing modest standards costs&#13;
about Rs. 181,000 per hectare. We expect communities on average will request investments costing&#13;
about Rs. 172,000 per hectare, or about 95% of the complete package cost. Taking 95% of the&#13;
maximum possible plot value increase of 21.8% yields 20.7%.&#13;
7.    In the following analysis, the EIRR is estimated assuming a land value increase of 20.7%. In&#13;
addition, a sensitivity analysis is presented in which the net present value (NPV) of the investment is&#13;
estimated while varying base costs, initial plot values, and plot value increases.&#13;
8.    A number of assumptions apply to both the EIRR and NPV calculations: (a) the&#13;
implementation period is six years; (b) the total investment is distributed as follows: 25.5 % water&#13;
supply; 25.8% drainage; 13.8% sanitation; 1.2% solid waste; and 33.8% access; (c) the average plot&#13;
value before improvements is Rs. 60,000 (d) administrative costs are 20% of base investment costs;&#13;
and (e) the economic conversion factor is 0.8. All figures are in 1994 Rupees.&#13;
9.    Table 2 shows the number of households benefitting from the program each year and the&#13;
&#13;

benefits accruing to them expressed as an increase in plot values. It also shows the net benefits under&#13;
various assumptions about plot value increases. Changing the plot value increase from 20 to 25%&#13;
causes net benefits to more than double over the project's life. Net benefits are negative when plot&#13;
values only increase by 15 %.&#13;

10.   Using the benefit and cost data in Table 2 associated with a 20.7% plot value increase, one can&#13;
calculate an EIRR of about 31 %. The EIRR is sensitive to changes in plot value increases. For example, a&#13;
19% plot value increase would yield an EIRR of about 20% while a 23% rise in plot value would result in an&#13;
EIRR of around 45%.&#13;
11.   The NPV calculations offer an alternative to the more volatile EIRR for gaining insight into the&#13;
economic viability of the infrastructure component under a variety of situations. As one would expect based&#13;
on the EIRR analysis, the NPV is not very sensitive to the discount rate, but is somewhat sensitive to the&#13;
assumed plot value increase. Table 3 shows that with a 20% increase in plot values the NPV remains&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
ANNEX 13&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
positive with discount rates ranging from 10 to 50%. A fivefold increase in the discount rate (from 10 to&#13;
50%) reduces the NPV by less than two-thirds. On the other hand, raising the plot value increase by 5&#13;
percentage points (from 20% to 25%) more than doubles the NPV, everything else equal.&#13;

12.   Taking the case where plot values increase by 20.7% as the "base case," sensitivity analysis&#13;
(not shown) reveals that the NPV remains positive (using a 30% discount rate) after reducing the&#13;
average plot value before improvements from Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 55,000, or increasing the base costs&#13;
by 10%. The EIRR in these two alternative scenarios drops to 19.5 % and 18.5%, respectively. The&#13;
NPV remains positive even after increasing base costs by 20%.&#13;

            The North West Frontier Province (NWFP)
            Community Infrastructure and National Housing Authority
            (NHA) Strengthening Project's objectives will be to
            increase the productivity and well-being of low-income
            groups through improving their living conditions by
            provision of basic infrastructure and community development.
            This will achieved by: a) infrastructure upgrading and
            community development in existing urban and rural low-income
            settlements; b) promoting the use of demand-driven,
            participatory design procedures and affordable standards for
            infrastructure; c) strengthening the ability of provincial
            and local governments to collaborate with communities to
            implement low-income infrastructure programs; and d)
            promoting sustainable arrangements for operation and
            maintenance of basic services. The project has two
            components in support of low-income communities. The major
            component is community infrastructure, consisting of 90
            percent of project costs, and consists of three
            sub-components: infrastructure upgrading; community
            development and design and implementation assistance. The
            other component is institutional development, including
            subcomponents for the Local Government, Elections and Rural
            Development Department (LGERDD) and the NHA.
