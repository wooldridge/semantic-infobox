Foreword&#13;
&#13;
Despite significant investments over the last 20 years,        successful approaches from small-scale, participatory&#13;
South Asia faces the most daunting sanitation challenge        sanitation programs and adapt them for effective use in&#13;
in any region in the world. More than 900 million South        large-scale rural sanitation programs?&#13;
Asians (66 percent of the total population) remain without&#13;
access to adequate sanitation. The vast majority of this       Based on lessons learned from eight case studies of&#13;
&#13;
unserved population are rural inhabitants but, at present,     innovative rural sanitation programs in Bangladesh, India,&#13;
&#13;
rural sanitation programs in the region are barely keeping     and Pakistan, this report summarizes the findings of a&#13;
&#13;
pace with population growth. One of the Millennium             regional study on scaling-up rural sanitation conducted by&#13;
&#13;
Development Goals is to halve the population without           the Water and Sanitation Program-South Asia (WSP-SA).&#13;
&#13;
access to hygienic sanitation facilities by 2015. While        Detailed analysis of program performance and context is&#13;
&#13;
governments in South Asia have pledged to meet this            used to draw out `factors of success' and common&#13;
&#13;
goal, its achievement will entail the provision of             constraints, and to suggest potential strategies for&#13;
&#13;
sustainable sanitation services to more than 450 million       scaling-up program approaches.&#13;
&#13;
people over the next 10 years.&#13;
                                                               While there are few truly successful large-scale sanitation&#13;
&#13;
This urgent challenge gives rise to a classic development      programs on which to base firm recommendations, the&#13;
&#13;
dilemma: how to develop rural sanitation programs              report lays out policy implications for large-scale rural&#13;
&#13;
capable of rapid and large-scale provision of cost-efficient   sanitation programs. It calls for new approaches to&#13;
&#13;
sanitation services, without cutting back on program           sanitation development, and for a new emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
elements critical to sustainability and long-term welfare      measuring success by long-term improvements in public&#13;
&#13;
improvements. Put another way: is it possible to take          health and well-being, rather than on the number of toilets built.&#13;

Definitions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For the purposes of this report, the following definitions apply:&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Safe management and disposal of human excreta, for example, through the use of toilets and good hygiene behavior.&#13;
&#13;
Note: `Environmental Sanitation' is a broader term, encompassing interventions that maintain public health by&#13;
&#13;
providing a clean environment and reducing exposure to disease, for example, behaviors and facilities that work&#13;
&#13;
together to safely manage and dispose of human and animal excreta, refuse, and wastewater; to control disease&#13;
&#13;
vectors; and to improve personal and domestic hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
Rural&#13;
&#13;
The rural space is that which is not urban.&#13;
&#13;
Note: This classification varies according to the criteria used in each area or country. In general, the rural population&#13;
&#13;
comprises those communities living outside cities and towns, but it may also include rural towns below a certain size&#13;
&#13;
(for example, 5,000 inhabitants).&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation hardware&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation facilities, for example, toilets, septic tanks, soakaways, sewerage systems, handwashing facilities, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation software&#13;
&#13;
Program activities that support and promote the provision of sanitation services and facilities, for example, community&#13;
&#13;
development, training, media campaigns, hygiene promotion, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Hygiene behavior&#13;
&#13;
Good hygiene behavior denotes practices that keep people and their surroundings clean and free from illness and&#13;
&#13;
infection, for example, washing hands with soap after defecation.&#13;
&#13;
Total sanitation approach&#13;
&#13;
A community-wide approach whose main aim is universal toilet use (total sanitation) in each community covered by&#13;
&#13;
the program. The total sanitation approach focuses on stopping open defecation on a community-by-community&#13;
&#13;
basis by highlighting the problems caused to all by open defecation within and around the community, and by&#13;
&#13;
ensuring that every household either builds and uses their own low-cost toilet, or has access to a shared toilet.&#13;
&#13;
Scaling-up rural sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Increasing the scale, the rate of provision, and the sustainability of rural sanitation services, such that universal&#13;
&#13;
sanitation coverage can be reached and maintained within a reasonable time frame. This implies:&#13;
 Inclusion (the vast majority of the target population is provided with improved and sustainable services within a&#13;
&#13;
reasonable time frame); and&#13;
 Institutionalization (a system of actors and institutions is in place with the necessary capacity and resources to&#13;
&#13;
deliver sustainable sanitation services indefinitely).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                            After Davis &amp; Iyer (2003), and Lockwood (2004)&#13;

3 Background&#13;
&#13;
Rural sanitation is a critical issue for South Asia. In a                     unserved population in South Asia and perhaps 30&#13;
period when decision-makers are recognizing the                               percent of those unserved globally. It should be noted that,&#13;
importance of adequate sanitation for public health and                       despite significant efforts to improve data collection,&#13;
poverty alleviation, South Asia contains more poor people                     national sanitation coverage figures from most countries&#13;
without sanitation than any other region on earth. The vast                   in South Asia remain inaccurate. In part, this reflects&#13;
majority of this unserved population live in rural areas.                     genuine difficulties associated with making household-by-&#13;
                                                                              household assessments on a national scale.&#13;
The figures presented at SACOSAN confirm that, among&#13;
the three South Asian countries covered by this study,                        All too often, sanitation coverage figures are overestimates&#13;
India has by far the lowest sanitation coverage. More than                    based on the number of toilets built by previous sanitation&#13;
750 million people in India are without access to adequate                    programs, without allowances for incomplete projects, or&#13;
sanitation, which represents about 80 percent of the                          for collapsed and abandoned toilets.&#13;

The main advantage of the total sanitation approach over conventional&#13;
policies is that it is a community-wide approach, which requires that&#13;
every household in the community stops open defecation and uses a&#13;
sanitary toilet.&#13;

As mentioned in the introduction, one of the key challenges    nFour public cases (financed by the government and&#13;
in expanding access to sanitation and improving public          implemented by the local government); and&#13;
health is to scale-up successful small-scale approaches into   nFour NGO cases (financed by non-governmental donors&#13;
large-scale national programs. Therefore, this analysis has a   and implemented by NGOs).&#13;
particular focus on the scale at which the case study&#13;
&#13;
programs operate, and on the relevance and replicability of     The first three public cases (Andhra Pradesh TSC, West&#13;

defecation in four of the cases: Andhra Pradesh TSC,               Improvements in hygiene behavior were examined by&#13;

However, some of the more successful case study&#13;
programs employed other innovative approaches to                   Gramalaya, an NGO that gives special emphasis to hygiene&#13;
&#13;
stopping open defecation:                                          promotion, made the largest impact on hygiene behavior.&#13;

   One of the best indicators of regular toilet usage is a         Improved hygiene behavior was also apparent in both the&#13;

&#13;
   been relocated above a new leach pit. Unfortunately,            improvements were less widespread and less sustained&#13;
   this indicator is less useful in sanitation programs that       than in the Gramalaya case. All three of these NGOs&#13;
   have been operating for less than a year, as the leach          (Gramalaya, NGO Forum, and Plan Bangladesh) focus on&#13;

   In the absence of full leach pits, toilet usage can be&#13;
   assessed by observation: Is the toilet wet from recent          divisions within communities, with several instances&#13;

   usage? Is the toilet clean? Is water available for anal         where households refused to follow advice or adopt&#13;
&#13;
   cleansing and toilet flushing? Is there evidence of             practices recommended by community hygiene promoters&#13;
   disuse (such as dust accumulation, blockages, toilets           from another political or social group.&#13;
   in need of repair, or goods stored in the toilet&#13;

toilets for the poor, or to promote expensive models with         subsidy offered (US$ 16 cash and 100 kg rice coupons) or&#13;

For example, none of the case study programs have                cultural preferences, demand for services, and institutional&#13;
developed viable solutions to the provision of low-cost          capacity. Program designers often prefer to begin pilot&#13;

reluctant households into improving their hygiene                 expenditures in sanitation programs. Effective and cost-&#13;

an independent review declares the area `free from open           were weak was the monitoring and assessment of their&#13;
defecation'. The idea is sound, but in Ahmednagar the             own performance. Despite a recognition that the ultimate&#13;
financial incentives paid to BPL households are relatively        aim of every sanitation program is to improve public health&#13;
small (US$ 8) compared to the typical cost of a toilet            and well-being, program performance is almost always&#13;
(US$ 20). In several of the villages visited, this has resulted   measured by physical or financial progress. In other words,&#13;
in the provision of free toilets to the poorest households        government ministers and program managers are&#13;
so that local governments can declare their jurisdiction          interested in how many toilets have been built for their&#13;

The total sanitation approach encourages rural households to use their&#13;
initiative and funds to build basic sanitary toilets, without imposing&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Ignition Â­ one way to stop open defecation?&#13;
&#13;
  Open defecation is a practice that is centuries old in most rural areas. To many villagers, it appears to cost nothing and to&#13;
  do little harm. Given this situation, something dramatic is required to change people's thinking and behavior, as the dire&#13;
  record of most rural sanitation programs attests. In Bangladesh, NGOs (notably VERC and WaterAid) developed a&#13;
  participatory `ignition process' to begin this change, including the following components:&#13;
  nSocial mapping of the village;&#13;
  nDefecation map with defecation mobility (including `crisis' defecation);&#13;
  nWalk of shame (transect walk to open defecation areas and water points);&#13;
  nChanges and trend of village water and sanitation situation;&#13;
  nLivelihood analysis and well-being grouping;&#13;
  nPossession of toilets by different groups;&#13;
  nExcreta calculation (amount of excreta added to village by open defecation);&#13;
  nContamination mapping (pollution caused by excreta and fecal-oral contamination links); and&#13;
  nGroup discussions on diseases due to open defecation, emergencies, medical costs.&#13;
&#13;
  Many of these steps will be familiar, but two of the elements, the walk of shame and the excreta calculation, are highly&#13;
  innovative and effective motivational tools. During transect walks to sites of open defecation, it is common for members&#13;
  of the community to be embarrassed to visit these dirty spots with outsiders, and attempt to move away quickly. But the&#13;
  facilitators like to stop and ask questions: which families use this spot for defecation? what happens during emergency&#13;
  defecation at night, or during diarrheal incidents?...these questions are often answered by people covering their noses&#13;
  with their hands. Normally, when outsiders are taken around a village, the community likes to focus on its positive aspects&#13;
  and achievements, and feel a sense of pride. These `walks of shame' reveal a different reality. Although everyone sees the&#13;
  filth and dirt every day, they seem only to awaken to the problem when visiting these sites with groups of outsiders that&#13;
  analyze the situation in detail.&#13;
&#13;
  A collective calculation of the amount of excreta that open defecation adds to the local environment is an interesting and&#13;
  participatory method of helping communities to realize the magnitude and extent of their sanitation problem. Participants&#13;
  make their own estimates of the amount of feces contributed by one person in one day, then keep multiplying to calculate&#13;
  contribution per family, per week, per year and so forth. In Mosmoil village (Rajshahi district, Bangladesh) the community&#13;
  calculated that 50,000 tons of human excreta were being added to their village environment every year. The communities&#13;
  are usually horrified by these figures, and immediately begin to wonder about the various routes of fecal contamination.&#13;
  Flow diagrams are then drawn to trace contamination routes to ponds, household utensils, domestic articles and, most&#13;
  important, to food through hands, flies, chickens, household pets, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
  After these intensive participatory exercises, a positive force to deal with the situation tends to emerge, with people&#13;
  voicing their eagerness to stop open defecation and to construct toilets. In this way, the `ignition process' triggers change&#13;
  and fires enthusiasm for sanitation development!&#13;
                                                                                                        After Kamal Kar (2003)&#13;

within less than a year, without any hardware subsidies.            sanitation and hygiene promotion.&#13;
&#13;
The total sanitation approach encourages rural                      However, it must be remembered that the total&#13;
households to use their initiative and funds to build               sanitation approach is a relatively new concept, which&#13;
basic sanitary toilets, without imposing standard                   is now being employed by many different actors in&#13;
external designs. This allows very low-cost toilets to              many different ways. The theory looks good, but careful&#13;
be built using freely available local materials, thus               evaluation of the practice is required before the&#13;
making toilets more affordable and accessible to the                sustainability and effectiveness of this new approach&#13;
rural poor. It also permits more program funds to be                can be verified.&#13;

This is an independent sanitation project, enacted by the                          low-cost `direct' toilet model. This design is based around&#13;
Upazila (sub-district) government with assistance and                              a standard toilet platform (all-in-one cement toilet slab and&#13;
support from the Department of Public Health Engineering                           gooseneck pan) mounted directly onto a concrete ring at&#13;

highly motivated and energetic local government official,                          ring). DPHE had already established an RSM in the&#13;
the Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), who is the chief                                Upazila, but the project led to several new RSMs being&#13;

sub-division of this land between children often leaves          that some of the users are not aware of the difference&#13;
&#13;
these plots cramped and inadequate. When combined                between safe and unsafe excreta disposal, and that&#13;
&#13;
with an above average population density, as in Rajarhat         others are abandoning their toilets and returning to open&#13;

The Rajarhat sanitation project managed to achieve almost                         nImplemented by a network of 635 partner NGOs;&#13;
universal toilet coverage for 36,000 households in only                           nSanitation projects completed in 1,200 villages;&#13;
two years. This is a commendable achievement, not least                           n900 toilet production centers;&#13;
because, by implementing toilets in every household of an                         nSupply-driven approach (little technology choice); and&#13;
entire sub-district without any hardware subsidy, it has                          nLimited local government involvement.&#13;
demonstrated that even the poorest of the poor can afford&#13;
low-cost toilets. However, the findings of this brief                             Approach&#13;

appraisal suggest that toilet usage is already declining                          Since 1999, NGO Forum has been promoting an&#13;

More detailed evaluation is required, but it seems likely                         (tubewells, rainwater harvesting structures, arsenic-iron&#13;
that the high coverage has been achieved by an overly                             removal plants, sanitary toilets) and software&#13;
coercive approach, which is strongly dependent on the                             (training, IEC materials, promotional activities). NGO&#13;
direct involvement and commitment of the UNO.                                     Forum found this approach effective, but it results&#13;
Sadly, it looks as if this project, which was originally                          in a relatively slow increase in sanitation coverage,&#13;
based on the Patgram pilot project, will end up in a similar                      and often struggles to reach the last 10-20 percent of&#13;

  Nirmal Gram Puraskar&#13;
&#13;
  In October 2003, the Government of India announced the Nirmal Gram Puraskar, an award for administrative units (Gram&#13;
  Panchayats, blocks, and districts) that achieve 100 percent sanitation coverage, which has been defined as:&#13;
  n100 percent toilet coverage of individual households;&#13;
  n100 percent school toilet coverage; and&#13;
  nFree from open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
  The Nirmal Gram Puraskar will be awarded to Gram Panchayats, blocks, districts, and any individuals or organizations that&#13;
  have been the driving force for effecting full sanitation coverage in the respective geographical areas. The Nirmal Gram&#13;
  Puraskar will be a minimum of:&#13;
  nUS$ 225 for individuals;&#13;
  nUS$ 450 for organizations;&#13;
  nUS$ 4,500 for Gram Panchayats;&#13;
  nUS$ 22,250 for blocks; and&#13;
  nUS$ 67,750 for districts.&#13;
&#13;
  These awards should be used for improving and maintaining sanitation facilities, with a focus on solid and liquid&#13;
  waste disposal, drainage facilities, and maintenance of the sanitation standard in the relevant area.&#13;
&#13;
  The State Government will identify and select Gram Panchayats, blocks, and districts that are fully covered and conform to&#13;
  the eligibility criteria. The Government of India will then engage independent evaluator(s) to confirm full sanitation coverage.&#13;
  Annually, a National Committee on Nirmal Gram Puraskar will draw up a list of those awarded the Puraskar.&#13;
                                                                                                                        Adapted from GoI, 2004&#13;

been a priority of the Government of West Bengal. When&#13;
the Intensive Sanitation Program was launched in 1990,&#13;
sanitation coverage in Medinipur District was barely five&#13;
percent. Today, in what was the largest district in India&#13;
(now split into two districts: East Medinipur and West&#13;
Medinipur), the provision of more than 900,000 toilets&#13;
has raised sanitation coverage to 60 percent. In 2001,&#13;
Medinipur had the distinction of being the first district&#13;
in the country to achieve 100 percent sanitation&#13;
coverage in an entire block: namely, Nandigram II&#13;
(population 104,600). These successes have led to&#13;
global recognition of the Medinipur approach, thus it is&#13;
no surprise that it has become the model for all&#13;
subsequent sanitation activities in the State.&#13;

The Total Sanitation Campaign in West Bengal is rightly      nUS$ 100 million budget for TSC in Maharashtra (US$ 3&#13;

simple to install, durable and easy to reuse; the low&#13;
&#13;
subsidy ensures affordability and frees up government&#13;
&#13;
funds for motivation and awareness raising; and, finally,&#13;
&#13;
the institutional model has encouraged cooperation&#13;
&#13;
between local government and NGOs, and laid the&#13;
&#13;
foundation for long-term support and monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
As sanitation coverage in West Bengal rises and spreads,&#13;
new challenges and questions emerge. The highly&#13;
standardized approach may prove too rigid to meet the&#13;
demands of universal coverage in all situations, and may&#13;
struggle to absorb the lessons from sanitation successes&#13;
in other areas. And while monopoly supply by rural&#13;
sanitary marts has probably helped to simplify&#13;
implementation, it may have suppressed the development&#13;
of more competitive and sustainable local services.&#13;

Stopping open defecation requires collective action, which suggests that&#13;
the financial incentives would be more effective if used to encourage the&#13;
attainment of community, rather than individual, goals.&#13;

   In Wadgaon Amli village (Ahmednagar block), one&#13;
   household was recently persuaded to rehabilitate their&#13;
   old toilet. It was an expensive brick-built model that cost&#13;
   about US$ 80 three years ago, when it was provided free&#13;
   under a previous government scheme. Sadly, it was never&#13;
   used, except as a private place for the women to wash&#13;
   themselves, because the family continued to defecate in&#13;
   the open even after the toilet was built.&#13;
&#13;
   But then the community decided to stop open defecation&#13;
   in the village. As a result, the women of the household&#13;
   report that, "it has become difficult to go out; all the&#13;
   bushes have been removed and there is no shelter; now&#13;
   we have to use a toilet." This family decided to invest&#13;
   US$ 11 in deepening the existing leach pit and installing&#13;
   a new ceramic pan, and have all started using the&#13;
   rehabilitated toilet. The women say that everyone has a&#13;
   toilet now, and that they won't go back to open&#13;
   defecation...even if the bushes grow back!&#13;

responsible for collecting applications from eligible&#13;

Construction monitoring is very high-tech. In most&#13;
districts, the block governments have digital cameras,&#13;
which are used to take photographs of each completed&#13;
toilet (also capturing the house and owner, to avoid the&#13;
reuse of photographs) and to store the images for online&#13;
access. In Kurnool district, a digital video tour of each&#13;
completed toilet is being recorded, with 125,000 such&#13;
virtual tours already available through the district&#13;
government's computer network.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   Technical Issues Â­ Toilets are Not as Simple as They Seem?&#13;
&#13;
   Sanitary toilets must be carefully designed to remove human excreta from the domestic environment and ensure its safe&#13;
   disposal, either on or off the household plot:&#13;
   nOn-site disposal (excreta stored in a sealed and isolated pit until safely degraded); and&#13;
   nOff-site disposal (excreta transferred to a central treatment works, for example, sewerage system).&#13;
&#13;
   In most rural communities, a household toilet and leach pit provide the most appropriate and effective method of safe&#13;
   excreta disposal. The technology is simple Â­ a leach pit is merely a hole in the ground, but the pit must be covered and&#13;
   sealed, as its primary function is to isolate the contents of the pit from the outside world. Leach pits dug in stable soils are&#13;
   normally unlined, but deeper pits, and those dug in unstable soils, often have a supportive lining (honeycomb brick or&#13;
   stonework; or perforated concrete rings). The toilet pan can be sited either directly above the pit, or offset in an enclosure&#13;
   beside the pit (with a connecting pipe). Either way, the toilet wastes are dumped or flushed into the leach pit, which is&#13;
   designed to retain the solid wastes while allowing both liquid and gaseous wastes to soak into the soil surrounding the pit.&#13;
&#13;
   Solids begin to accumulate in the bottom of the leach pit, greatly reducing infiltration through the clogged soil pores in the&#13;
   base of the pit. For this reason, leach pits should always have permeable sides (except for the uppermost 30 cm, which&#13;
   is normally solid lined to retain loose topsoil and provide structural strength). Leach pits with solid-lined sides (for example,&#13;
   concrete rings with cemented joints) will prevent liquids and gases from being absorbed by the soil, leaving the pit contents&#13;
   smelly, wet, and difficult to empty.&#13;
&#13;
   In more affluent rural areas in India, local masons tend to be more familiar with urban sanitation systems, and frequently&#13;
   make the mistake of trying to convert toilets with twin leach pits into septic systems. The usual practice is to provide a solid&#13;
   lining to the offset leach pits, then link the pits with a connecting pipe, and provide an overflow pipe on the second pit.&#13;
   In this way, the liquid wastes pass through both pits before being discharged from the overflow pipe.&#13;
&#13;
   Badly designed `septic pit' systems allow floating `scum' and suspended solids to pass directly through the pits and&#13;
   discharge to the open. And even if these `septic pits' are well-designed and operating as intended, the effluent is likely to&#13;
   be highly pathogenic (disease carrying) and may contain viable hookworm and roundworm eggs.25 Septic systems require&#13;
   baffle walls or t-pipes between pits (or chambers), and the septic effluent must be safely disposed into a large soakpit or&#13;
   into a sewerage system. Septic pit systems that discharge pathogenic effluent in the vicinity of rural homes are not&#13;
   providing safe excreta disposal, and should not be considered as sanitary toilets. In addition, septic systems accumulate&#13;
   deep layers of pathogenic sludge, which require periodic removal and safe disposal. The most effective method of desludging&#13;
   is by vacuum pump and tanker, but this technology is expensive and rarely available in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
   Septic systems also require ventilation, as the anaerobic processes that take place produce gases that need release.&#13;
   Sufficient ventilation is often provided by the inlet and outlet pipework, but an additional ventilation pipe may be required&#13;
   in some cases. However, water-sealed leach pit systems do not require vent pipes,26 as their permeable sides allow any&#13;
   gases in the pit to percolate into the surrounding soil. When a vent pipe is necessary, it is essential that its outlet be covered&#13;
   with insect screen, as insects are attracted by the odorous gases emanating from the vent pipe. Without the screen, insects&#13;
   can enter the pit, lay eggs inside it, and fly directly from excreta to food. Unscreened vent pipes leave excreta exposed&#13;
   to the open air and lower the barriers to fecal contamination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25Tests on septic tanks in rural India found that 90 percent of effluent samples contain viable hookworm and Ascaris eggs (Franceys et al, 1992).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26The water seal prevents smelly gases from re-entering the toilet enclosure (note: vent pipes are required in pit latrines that do not have water seals,&#13;
for example, VIP latrines).&#13;

  Tiruchi Village Cracks the Whip on Open-air Defecation&#13;
&#13;
  Thandavampatti hamlet (population 276; 69 houses) at Araichi village Panchayat in Tiruchi district, Tamil Nadu, was&#13;
  officially declared the first rural habitation in India to totally prevent open defecation on January 26, 2003. Two months&#13;
  earlier, Tiruchi NGO Gramalaya staff went to the village to conduct a meeting for the local women's self-help group. The&#13;
  women reluctantly outlined their problem while the men who were quizzed about it stated that they faced a crisis, as they&#13;
  were unable to use either the nearby road or fields to defecate.&#13;
&#13;
  The Namakkal-Thuraiyur single-lane road is used by men and children to relieve themselves during the day, and by women&#13;
  at night. As a result, the villagers face a torrent of abuse from heavy vehicle drivers that come close to hitting those&#13;
  squatting by the road; and local farmers resent stepping on the feces in their fields, and complain that the tether ropes of&#13;
  their animals become coated with feces when the animals graze. But what really changed the villagers' minds was when&#13;
  they were taken in a procession through areas they previously used for answering calls of nature and saw for themselves&#13;
  the shocking situation.&#13;
&#13;
  Offered a choice, the villagers opted for their own toilets. A sanitation `ladder' was drawn up for the villagers, showing&#13;
  various toilet types from zero budget varieties to pour-flush toilets costing around US$ 64.75. The favored option was the&#13;
  water-saving dry pit latrine, based on a Bangladesh model. Work began on January 16 when 13 houses dug the necessary&#13;
  three-foot deep pits and covered them with a cement slab with a drop hole and wooden cover. Thatch, old mats, and used&#13;
  jute bags served as a superstructure, with an old cloth covering the doorway. The Panchayat president lauded the hamlet&#13;
  for its outstanding example, and said she would encourage residents of Araichi, the main village, and the remaining hamlets&#13;
  to follow their example shortly.&#13;

approach to implement its health and sanitation programs, and&#13;

It is increasingly obvious that if NGOs such as Gramalaya are to have a&#13;
major impact on public health, they need to work more closely and&#13;
cooperatively with local government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One of the key scale issues is the role of local government.   Like many NGOs, another factor in its success has&#13;
At present, NGOs such as Gramalaya often take the lead         been its size. It works in just two blocks, covering only&#13;
sanitation role in their block and report directly to the      200 villages to date and, despite current plans to expand&#13;
district authorities. This tends to exclude the block and GP   into another 100 villages, has yet to prove that it can work&#13;

subsidies by local bodies. The study also found that&#13;
                                                               As an NGO, Gramalaya has neither the guaranteed&#13;
Gramalaya lacked the authority necessary to enforce&#13;
                                                               long-term presence, nor the funding and authority of local&#13;

encourage and assist reluctant households and severely&#13;

There is also a question over the long-term sustainability     NGOs such as Gramalaya. It is not unusual for NGOs to&#13;
of the NGO-only approach. Gramalaya, and its current           value their independence from government and the&#13;
approach, is dependent on its funding, which determines        advantages that this status confers when working with&#13;
the number of communities that it can work in at any time.     rural communities. But it is increasingly obvious that if&#13;
This rolling approach, whereby a new block of                  NGOs such as Gramalaya are to have a major impact on&#13;
communities are tackled every year, does not allow             public health, they need to work more closely and&#13;
for long-term follow-up in an ever-growing number              cooperatively with local government.&#13;

centralization of urban services from urban local councils&#13;
to the Tehsil (sub-district) level, and the decentralization of&#13;
rural services from provincial line departments to the TMA.&#13;
Another key difference is that the head of this new local&#13;
government body is an elected official (Tehsil Nazim) rather&#13;
than a bureaucrat. Unsurprisingly, most TMAs are still&#13;
finding their feet, and many of the reforms have not yet&#13;
been put into practice.&#13;
&#13;
Case study context&#13;
In assessing the importance of local context on the case&#13;
study, two factors stand out: the relatively urban nature of the&#13;
southern Punjab villages in which the LPP works; and the&#13;
unusual level and quality of the support available to the LPP.&#13;
&#13;
The villages studied range in size from 50-400                     Rather than sharing the costs of each component, the&#13;
&#13;
households, but almost all comprise tightly packed                 responsibility for providing the components is shared:&#13;
&#13;
settlements (several were planned villages with regular            construction of the internal components is financed and&#13;
&#13;
street layouts) within which each household (or group of           managed entirely by the community; provision of the&#13;
&#13;
households) lives in a brick-built house in a walled               external components, technical assistance, and social&#13;
&#13;
compound. Most of the villages have brick-paved roads              guidance are the responsibility of the LPP (and its donors).&#13;
&#13;
with cement-lined open drainage systems, and&#13;
                                                                   The technology is simple: each household toilet flushes&#13;
approximately 60 percent of households have toilets,&#13;
                                                                   into a small interceptor chamber (known as a t-haudi);&#13;
usually of the pour-flush variety with brick-built&#13;
                                                                   when this interceptor chamber fills, the liquid overflows&#13;
enclosures. Very few households have any form of&#13;
                                                                   into a concrete sewer pipe; from there, a network of sewer&#13;
septic tank or latrine pit, and most households flush&#13;
                                                                   pipes and manholes drains the settled effluent to a&#13;
their untreated toilet wastes (sewage) and wastewater&#13;
                                                                   screening chamber connected to a large collection tank&#13;
directly into the nearby open drains.&#13;
                                                                   (usually sited on the outskirts of the village); finally, the&#13;
&#13;
When these open drains block, which they frequently do,            untreated effluent is pumped from the collection tank to an&#13;

the streets are flooded with highly pathogenic sewage and          irrigation channel feeding nearby fields.&#13;

                                                                   The LPP employs `social engineers', which it trains in&#13;
improved sanitation. However, the relatively well-&#13;
                                                                   social mobilization, mapping, scheme design, and&#13;
developed nature of the villages means that there is little&#13;
                                                                   construction supervision. Once a community (or&#13;
demand for simple on-site sanitation solutions, such as pit&#13;

The LPP uses a `component-sharing' approach modelled               initial costing. The technical design is important, as it&#13;
&#13;
on that of the OPP. The challenge of providing sanitation          determines what is `internal' or `external'. The LPP has a&#13;

            Lessons learned from Bangladesh, India, and
            Pakistan - scaling-up rural sanitation in South Asia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In South Asia, more than 900 million
            people (66 percent of the total population) remain without
            access to adequate sanitation. Despite significant
            investments, rural sanitation coverage in the region is
            barely keeping pace with population growth. Current
            approaches to the development and provision of rural
            sanitation services in the region are either not effective,
            or are not at sufficient scale to make an impact on the
            enormous population that lacks adequate sanitation. This
            regional study was commissioned by the Water and Sanitation
            Program-South Asia (WSP-SA) to address some of these issues.
            The main objectives of the study are: to develop case
            studies of innovative approaches to rural sanitation in
            South Asia; to analyze the factors of success (and
            constraints) found in these case studies; to assess
            potential strategies (and constraints) to scaling-up the
            approaches used in case studies; and to draw up policy
            recommendations for large-scale rural sanitation programs in
            the region.
