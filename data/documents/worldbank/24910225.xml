                                                   1.1         Lower oil prices and higher electricity tariffs are the two major price changes hitting South African consumers in 2015. In June&#13;
                                                               2014, the global oil price exceeded $100/barrel but the slowdown in China and increased supply contributed to a 40 percent&#13;
                                                               price drop, which was felt in South Africa from September 2014, although the randâ&#128;&#153;s depreciation muted the price declineâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                                                               impact. Domestic gasoline (petrol) prices fell 28 percent from peak (June 2014) to trough (February 2015)â&#128;&#148;but in Q2 almost&#13;
                                                               fully reversed. Electricity tariffs rose 12.6 percent in April 2015 (box figure 1).&#13;
                                                                    Household consumption patterns play a major role in how these price changes affect the poor.5 The oil-price shock cut&#13;
                                                               prices for gasoline and related products, directly, but also fed through into prices of other goods and services that use fuel or&#13;
        16                                                     electricity, indirectly. South African headline inflation fell sharply on lower fuel prices, but the prices of food and transportation&#13;
                                                               hardly moved.&#13;
                                                                    Fuel outlays account for almost 3.5 percent of average household consumption, electricity around 4 percent (box figure 2).&#13;
                                                               But for extremely poor households (with individuals living on less than $1.25 a day), fuel occupies less of the consumption&#13;
                                                               basket (1.1 percent) and electricity more (5.7 percent). For the non-poor, fuel and electricity each comprise more than 4&#13;
                                                               percent of the basket. Thus the relatively better-off benefit more from the fall in gasoline prices. But the poor are left compara-&#13;

                                                                    The indirect effect of the price changes depends on how households allocate their budget. Poorer households spend a larger&#13;
                                                               share of their incomes on food and beverages (38.3 percent) and housing utilities (26 percent). Richer households spend more&#13;

                      partially offset by the losses tied to higher electricity prices (â&#128;&#147;0.8 percent). The poor are disproportionally affected by higher&#13;
                      electricity prices (absent changes in the free basic amount of electricity provided to poor households), which cost them 1&#13;

                      with small and medium households, workers in industry and services, the better educated, and those living in urban areas. But&#13;
                      if the higher fuel levy is factored into the calculations, poor households are worse off.&#13;

&amp;#12;          Box    What do exports mean for jobs and skills demand in South Africa?10&#13;
         1.2      Exports are a critical source of growth for South Africa; they are also an important channel for productivity enhancement. But&#13;
                  what do they mean for jobs? Drawing on a newly developed World Bank dataset11 on the labor content of exports, we explore&#13;
                  the possible implications of exports for employment and skills demand in South Africa, paying particular attention to South&#13;
                  Africaâ&#128;&#153;s integration into manufacturing global value chains (GVCs) over the past decade.&#13;
                       A critical finding is that manufacturing matters for jobs, but its importance comes mainly through its backward links to&#13;
                  the domestic economy (box figure 1). The indirect employment impact of manufacturing exports (jobs in industries providing&#13;
                  inputs into manufacturing exports) is nearly 4.5 times greater than the direct employment impact. Indeed, while the minerals&#13;
                  sector generates the most direct jobs due to its dominance in the export basket and in relative labor intensity, its weak&#13;
                                                                                                                                                          21&#13;
                  backward links to the domestic economy stifle its overall employment impact.&#13;

                  How have manufacturing exports and GVC integration affected the level and nature of jobs in South Africa? To understand this,&#13;
                  we focus on the automotive sector, where South Africa has grown its exports and has become deeply integrated into GVCs over&#13;
                  the past decade (box figures 2 and 3). The first point is that while the rapid growth of exports meant that nominal jobs in&#13;
                  the sector increased substantially over the decade (box figure 2), the relative labor intensity of South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s exports declined&#13;
                  sharply: where automotive exports contributed around $37 of labor per $100 of exports in 2001, this declined to below $30&#13;
                  in 2011 (box figure 3). This level of labor in exports is well below that of Brazil where the labor content has increased; and&#13;
                  India, where it has remained broadly stable. South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s decline in labor intensity of its auto exports is explained almost fully&#13;
                  by declining labor content in direct manufacturingâ&#128;&#148;indeed, the labor content of direct manufacturing jobs fell by almost half&#13;
                  over the decade.&#13;
                       Still, significant job growth resulted from the automotive sectorâ&#128;&#153;s extensive backward links to the domestic economy. While&#13;
                  each direct job in the sector was linked to one indirect job in 2001, by 2013 it was linked to three. Most important, this came&#13;
                  through services sector links, which is unsurprising. In fact, it is exactly what we might expect in an environment of GVC&#13;
                  integration: exports make increasing use of foreign inputs (reducing direct labor demand) but coordinating these inputs requires&#13;
                  more intensive use of (mainly domestic) services, including financial services, transport and logistics, and other business&#13;
                  services&#13;
                       GVC integration also appears to have substantial implications for skills demand. Box figure 3 shows that for direct jobs in&#13;
                  the automotive sector, the contribution of unskilled labor per $100 of exports has declined sharply over the decade, while that&#13;
                  of skilled labor has remained steady. This is, again, perhaps to be expected in the context of GVC integration, where the require-&#13;
                  ments for productivity, quality, and consistency from global lead firms likely contribute to increased capital intensity and&#13;
                  demand for higher skills. Coupling this with the strong shift toward indirect-services employment, which also tends to have a&#13;
                  higher skills bias, implications for demand for skilled versus unskilled labor may be important, perhaps accelerating the underly-&#13;
                  ing skills bias in South African production..&#13;

&amp;#12;          Box    Demographic change and the long-term sustainability of social spending (continued)&#13;
         2.1           Demographic trends point to favorable fiscal dynamics over the long run, but only if economic growth improves and there&#13;
                  are no new spending pressures or initiatives. If growth remains around 2 percent a year, the analysis found that social spending&#13;
                  would increase as a share of GDP, causing the debt burden to rise, if there are no changes in benefits or taxation. Pressure to&#13;
                  address youth unemployment would require expanded vocational training and public works programs, demanding greater fiscal&#13;
                  outlays. New social policies, such as National Health Insurance, would add further pressure (box figure 3). Accommodating these&#13;
                  initiatives while safeguarding sustainability would require some combination of higher growth, taxes, and reallocation of&#13;
                  resources from other programs.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                      33&#13;

            South Africa economic update : jobs and
            South Africa’s changing demographics
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Global growth hit a soft patch at the
            start of 2015. In the first quarter it slowed to 2.0
            percent, quarter on quarter (q/q) annualized, from 2.3
            percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. The slowdown was
            reflected in a decline in global manufacturing activity, on
            the back of weak industrial production and goods trade data,
            especially in large emerging markets. Among high-income
            countries, economic activity is strengthening. Euro Area
            growth picked up to 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2015
            from 1.3 percent the previous quarter. Growth in Japan
            accelerated to 2.4 percent in the first quarter from 1.1
            percent in the previous quarter. For the second quarter,
            despite the uncertainty surrounding Greece, the Euro Area
            Composite PMI in July remained close to a four-year high.
            Confidence indicators for the second quarter point to
            further improvements, while indicators in Japan also suggest
            continued, albeit moderate, growth.
