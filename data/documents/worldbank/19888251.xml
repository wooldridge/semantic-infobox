                 MR. BLACK:    The purpose of this special meeting is to&#13;
            consider the report and recommendations on the proposed loan&#13;
            of 20 million dollars to the Indian Iron s.nd Steel Company.&#13;
                 I would like to first call on Mr. Basch.&#13;
                 MR. BASCH:    Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, four years ago, on&#13;
            December 18, '52, an agreement was signed to make a loan of&#13;
            $31-1/2 million with the Indian Iron and Steel Company to help:&#13;
            fine.nee its expansion program.&#13;
&#13;
                 It is rather inviting to compare the situation at the tim~&#13;
            with that one which is at present.&#13;
                 When we negotiated the '52 loan, tqe company in addition&#13;
                                                   ~~~                           I&#13;
            to our loan had to get an advance from   partt~a'h-fUnd/       of    I&#13;
&#13;
            20 million dollars and to secure a loan from the Government ofl&#13;
                       16                                                        I&#13;
            India of Wmi llion dollars.                                          !&#13;
&#13;
                 In   addition~       negotiations, the Government undertook&#13;
            to provide any additional funds which would be needed for the&#13;
                                                                                 !&#13;
            completion of the project or satisfactory working capital.       Th~&#13;
&#13;
            production of the company at the time was about 250 up to 280&#13;
                       ~&#13;
            thousand de-llars .-&#13;
                 In the last two years, the position of the company has&#13;
&#13;
            changed greatly, due mainly to improved operating efficiency.&#13;
            Production has increased to 450,000 tons of steel as compared&#13;
                                       3-6'0. cr::'O"-&#13;

        I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 The company has utilized only one-half of the government&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             4&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                 loan and decided not to draw on the rest of the government&#13;
                 loan.&#13;
&#13;
                         The company did not need to use any or the overdraft facili-&#13;
                 ties which were available by the banks, and the company can now&#13;
                 start a new expansion program which will result in a further&#13;
                 strengthening of its position, and on the completion of the&#13;
                 program the company will produce less billets, more               structur~&#13;
                 rail and bars, and will sell less pig iron than was proposed in&#13;
                 the program in 1952.&#13;
                         The present expansion program or the company is a part&#13;
                 of the government plan to increase production of steel from 1.3&#13;
                 at present to 4-l/2 million tons by 1960,           1&#13;

                 news which we   got   just in the recent days, it was decided not/&#13;

          loan of 15 million pounds, and the Bank syndicate a loan of&#13;
           JI&#13;
         ~1/2    million pounds.&#13;
&#13;
                The total investment in the Government plants is nearly&#13;
&#13;
          750 million dollars, for which credits of less than 200 million&#13;
&#13;
          dollars have been secured.&#13;
&#13;
                The loan documents, as you have seen, conform to the&#13;
&#13;
          normal pattern of the Bank's loan and guarantee agreements.&#13;
&#13;
                I should like to mention here one point:        When the 1952&#13;
&#13;
          loan agreement was negotiated, there was a first mortgage on&#13;
&#13;
          the physical property and floating charge on the remainder of&#13;
                                             ~&#13;
          the company's assets which was e..s ta"bl:ie.ReEi on the trust deed&#13;
&#13;
          in favor of the first mortgage debenture holders, so-called&#13;
&#13;
          sterling dbentures.      It was arranged later on that the Bank&#13;
                                 ~~&#13;
          security established OR tAeir tz:ust deed with Bfaring Brothers&#13;
                          ~&lt;&#13;
         Limited will range..-pari passu with the sterling debentures&#13;
&#13;
          security.&#13;
&#13;
                Now because of its improved financial position the&#13;
          company has decided, and the Government of India has agreed,&#13;
                      .          or(-~&#13;
          to redeem~advance e-pper9'Mi..,,- a~l the sterling debentures.            1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                The proposed loan and the bonds issuable under it would&#13;
                                ~~~&#13;
         be secured by a mortgage{\Snd ranlAng pari passu with the&#13;
&#13;
         mortgage and charge constituted by the 1954 trust deed.                    I&#13;
&#13;
                The new trust   deed~e    1954   tr~st   deed, shall constitute!&#13;
                                                                                    i&#13;
         security for the proposed loan and bonds and for the first loSJjl          I&#13;
                                                                                    I&#13;
&#13;
        , and bonds issued thereunder.                                              I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               6&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                 The various mortgages and charges in favor of the Govern-&#13;
          ment of India and the State Bank of India will be further            ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          per teer.&#13;
&#13;
                 There is another feature.       Similarly as in the case of&#13;
          the loan to Tata Iron and Steel Company, the borrower will be&#13;
          allowed to draw on the loan up to six million dollars before&#13;
          the security arrangements have been completed.&#13;
                 The company started placing orders in June this year.&#13;
         It is proposed that reimbursement be made for expenditures&#13;
         made since June 30, 1956.       The total amount spent at the end&#13;
         of November this year would amount to slightly more than one&#13;
         and one-half million dollars.       The total am.oun t of orders&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
         placed since the end of November is about 11.3 million dollars!,          I&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
&#13;
         of it, roughly six million dollars in U.        s.   dollars, about   2.~&#13;
         in Germany and 2.5 in Great Britain.                                      I&#13;
                                                                                   !&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
&#13;
                 The remainder of the contracts will most likely be placed/&#13;
         in these three countries.       The exact amounts of it ve don't&#13;
         lmow.&#13;
                 Finally, I should lik:e to mention that the report of the&#13;
         ~an            Committee has been duly executed.&#13;

                 It is likely that ocean transportation will continue to&#13;
         raise problems, but we do not at present feel that these are&#13;
         so serious that they will jeopardize the success of the project&#13;
         and its punctual completion.&#13;
                 The inland transportation situation gives us some anxiety,&#13;
         not only because of the importance now of reducing these de-&#13;
         lays and shifting imported equipment from Calcutta to the works&#13;
         but also because the development of the steel industry in this&#13;
         whole area of India depends for its success on the capacity of!&#13;
         the railways to develop their facilities to meet the growing&#13;
         traffic which will be generated by the new steel plants.&#13;
&#13;
                 We shall keep in close touch with the railways to watch&#13;
         the progress being made in this connection.     The management ofl&#13;

              Are there any questions?&#13;
              Mr. Warren.&#13;
              MR. WARREN:    Mr. Chairman, in your report you refer to the&#13;
         $20 million or the equivalent thereof in currencies other than&#13;
         dollars, but I think I hes.rd Mr. Be,seh say that some six million&#13;
         of it would be in dolls.rs.&#13;
              MR. BLACK:    As I understand it, nine million dolls.rs&#13;
         equivalent of this loan is needed for purchases in the UK.           Seven&#13;
         million dolls.rs equivalent is needed for purchases in Germany â&#128;¢.&#13;
&#13;
         That leaves four million dolls.rs.&#13;
              MR. BASCH:    Seven in the   u. S.,   four in Germany.&#13;
              MR. BLACK:    I beg your pardon.      Four million dollars in&#13;
         Germany and seven million dollars in the      u.   S.   Those are the&#13;
         orders that have been placed.&#13;
              MR. WARREN:    So that the loan vill be partially in dollars.&#13;
              MR. BLACK:    We don't know what the loan will be.       We have:&#13;
         requested the UK for release of the nine million dollars equiva.-&#13;
         lent in sterling, and we have not had an answer back yet.          In&#13;
         the case of marks, to bring the Board up to date on the German&#13;
         marks situation, there was about 143 million marks of the 18&#13;
         percent which had been unused.&#13;
              Dr. Donner, you correct me if I sm wrong on this.&#13;
                                                                                 i&#13;
              On my recent visit to Germany, I was told by the German            i&#13;
                                                                                 I&#13;

         government that they would immediately release 30 mi 111 on mark$&#13;
         Which they had formerly not planned to release until a later&#13;

                                                                                  11&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL               1'3~&#13;
             date.     That left .ll:3'- million German marks that had been un-&#13;
             released.     We had talks with the German government about re-&#13;
             leasing all the remainder of the 18 percent, and we are waiting&#13;
&#13;
             now for an answer to that request, but that doesn't make very&#13;
&#13;
             much difference as far as this loan is concerned because the&#13;
             borrowers of the Bank have already placed orders in Germany&#13;
&#13;
             far in excess of the total amount of the 18 percent.&#13;
&#13;
                     So if we got a release of all of the German 18 percent,&#13;
&#13;
             we would have to allocate a certain amount to each loan.&#13;
                     The total amount of the unreleased 18 percent in Germany          I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             is about 30 million dollars, and orders have been placed for&#13;
             German equipment of over 90 million dollars.       So we would have&#13;
&#13;
             to allocate the 18 percent even if it was all released.&#13;
                     So I can't answer to you whether this loan will be all&#13;
&#13;
             in dollars or part in sterling or part in German marks or par&#13;
&#13;
             in dollars.     We just don't know until we find out.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. OVERBY:    Mr. Chairman, you just don't know whether&#13;
             you will have Deutschmarks :celeased for this particular loan,&#13;
&#13;
             is that your--&#13;
                  MR. BLACK:       Well, the Deutschmarks, as I say, if the re-&#13;
             quest is granted for the release of all the Deutschmarks, which&#13;
&#13;
             we hope will happen, we still won't have enough Deutschmarks&#13;
&#13;
             to go around.     So we would have to allocate Deutschmarks to&#13;
&#13;
             different loans.&#13;
&#13;
                     You see, we have used a good many Deutschmark:s already,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            12&#13;

             and the total amount unreleased now is what, Dr. Donner, 30&#13;
             million dollars -- about?&#13;
                  DR. DONNER:    The total amount released?&#13;
                  MR. BLACK:    Unreleased.&#13;

                  MR. BLACK:    About 30 million dollars.&#13;
                  As I say, we have got orders way in excess of that.      So&#13;
             we just haven't got enough German marks, even if it is re-&#13;
             leased, you see.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. OVERBY:    I don't lalow.   This is an old song with me,&#13;
             but it seems to me the time has long since passed when we oughÂ·&#13;
             to have pretty free releases from some or our friends, and I&#13;
             don't quite understand why with the financial position as it&#13;
             exists in Germany and probably in a lot or other countries we&#13;
             couldn't have a pretty free release of moneys to meet the re-&#13;
        ! quirements of Bank loans.&#13;
        11&#13;
                  Reserves are awful substantial now, and there have been&#13;
             statements about willingness to finance development in less&#13;
             developed countries, and I would think the place to begin is&#13;
         . on an obligation that has been outstanding for ten years --&#13;
             well, perhaps Germany hasn't been in 12 yea.rs, but a longstand&#13;
             ing obligation, if I may put it that way, and I would like to&#13;
&#13;
             ask Mr. Donner on Deutschma.rks whether he can give us any more&#13;
             precise hope that in fact a.a a. practical matter there will be&#13;
&#13;
             Deutschmarks   a~la.ble   for this loan.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        13&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
              MR. BLACK:    Well, I would like to say in behalf of&#13;
         Dr. Donner -- unusual for me to be taking up for someone&#13;
          that he has made heroic efforts to do this and has said that&#13;
         he has the backing of practically every one in his government&#13;
          to make this release.&#13;
              There is a budgetary problem that various suggestions&#13;
         have been made to get around.    This is one of the main objects&#13;
         of my visit to Germany, and I am still quite hopeful.       I thin&#13;
         Dr. Donner will agree.&#13;
              All I want to say is it is not Dr. Donner's fault.&#13;
              MR. OVERBY:    I think all of us realize that there is a&#13;
         very fine and able budget minis tar in Germany who is an ex-&#13;
          tremely strong and forceful character, and we are allaJiare of&#13;
          that, but I am hopeful that Dr. Donner can give us an optimis ic&#13;
         forecast on the flexibility of Mr. Schaeffer.&#13;
              DR. DONNER:    May I comment on three points.&#13;
&#13;
              You expressed, Mr. Overby, appreciation of our finance&#13;
         minister.   Mr. Black, too, was greatly impressed by him.     As&#13;
         a matter of fact, he was impressed to such a degree that he&#13;
         told Mr. Schaeffer that if he wants he shouldn't be finance&#13;
         minister any more, such facilities as he has should not be un sed&#13;
&#13;
         and might be put to useful purpose in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
              MR. BLACK:    I offered him the job as Treasurer.&#13;
&#13;
              DR. DONNER:   Second, as to these 113 million, as Mr. Bla k&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              14&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             says, there are budgetary problems which the finance minister&#13;
             believes cannot be overcome at the present time.&#13;
                  The thinking of the government with the finance minister&#13;
             has been that these 113 million be released over a period of&#13;
             five years, commencing 1958.   However, as Mr. Black as already&#13;
             said, all the other ministers are of the opinion that GermanyÂ·&#13;
             is not only, as you have said, Mr. Overby, in a position in-&#13;
             ternally and externally to make these releases -- this release&#13;
             immediately, but they are in addition to that of the opinion&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
             that Germany should do so because ot its membership obligationr.&#13;
        ,         The ma. t ter wi 11 be brought to the cabinet, and in the        â&#128;¢&#13;
        ii                                                      r            i&#13;
        ii Cabinet the other minis tere, particularly Minister ER:ard t, wi 1,b.   1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        II try to overcome resistance on the part of the finance minis ter ~&#13;
                                                                           1&#13;
        i                                                                          !&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        11        Mr. Black has talked to the Chancellor, Mr. Adenauer.&#13;
        I&#13;
             Mr. Adenauer has expressed sympathy, too.&#13;
&#13;
        I         So I can only mention that everything possible which can&#13;
        I&#13;
        I be done for the purpose of getting an early release of the re-&#13;
             ma1n1ng part of 113 Deutschmark has been done, all wh1ch at th&#13;
             present time remains for us to do is cross our hands and hope&#13;
             the best.&#13;
&#13;
                  I personally am hopeful that the actions under considers.-&#13;
             tion, the Cabinet meeting, will have the effect which we desir â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. OVERBY:   Well, let me say, Mr. Chairman, I have full&#13;
&#13;
             sympathy with Dr. Donner's problems and with the problems of&#13;
&#13;
             some of the other ministers.   or   course, as a Treasury officia ,&#13;
&amp;#12;        'I&#13;
                                                                             15&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             I am sympathetic to the budget problems that every country has&#13;
&#13;
             but I do hope that with the very substantial cash reserve that&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Schaeffer has been able to accumulate for other purposes&#13;
             that he might be induced to be a little more flexible and that&#13;
&#13;
             we could get an early and favorable result.&#13;
&#13;
                  I think, in fact, the whole thing outht to be released&#13;
                                                        I&#13;
             promptly.   I don't personally see any real value or justifica-&#13;
&#13;
             tion for not having the whole thing released freely.&#13;
&#13;
                  DR. DONNER:     That is the idea underlying the forthcoming&#13;
&#13;
             Cabinet meeting on these matters.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. BLACK:    This is true, as I said, that even if it is&#13;
&#13;
             re leased, that would be used up fairly quickly, and we wi 11&#13;
&#13;
             then not have marks available to cover purchases in Germany.&#13;
&#13;
             We have got no way to get any other marks because you haven't&#13;
&#13;
             got a capital in GermanyÂ· that is low enough to justify our&#13;
&#13;
             borrowing money.&#13;
&#13;
                  So, even if we get the re lease of 18 percent, we wi 11 use&#13;
&#13;
             it pretty quickly.&#13;
                  MR. OVERBY:     I will only say, Mr. Chairman, I would feel&#13;
&#13;
             more comfortable if we had all the Deutschme.rks released and&#13;
&#13;
             had used them all and then had to confront that problem, rathe&#13;
&#13;
             than the one we now confront.&#13;
&#13;
                  DR. DONNER:     We fully agree with you.&#13;
&#13;
                  I said I would like to comment on three points.     Now&#13;
&#13;
             there is a further point raised by Mr. Overby, and I think I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              16&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             should take the oppor'tuni ty to c la.rify that.&#13;
                  Mr. Overby asked whether the Bank has approached the&#13;
             public, whether it is willing to release more Deutschma.rk for&#13;
             that purpose.&#13;
&#13;
                  Now we have considered it to be a great achievement&#13;
             that Mr. Eha.rdt has withdrawn any ties to the release of the&#13;
             German 18 percent Deutschma.rk.      As you know, he has said that&#13;
&#13;
             the Bank is completely free to use Deutschmark release as the         J&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Bank sees fit for any project in any currency.                        I&#13;
                  Now this is also the present policy and will be the      futur~&#13;
        :1   policy.    As a matter of fact, I am of the opinion that the&#13;
        L~&#13;
        11   Bank should not even ask or pursue the project release line,&#13;
        11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        1Â·&#13;
             that instead it should establish, as far as we can, the policy&#13;
&#13;
        i    of unconditional releases.&#13;
        I&#13;
        I         MR. WARREN:     I agree entirely with what Mr. Donner has&#13;
        !I&#13;
        !&#13;
&#13;
        I    just said, that the important thing is when these 18 percent&#13;
        I: release do come in from now on that they be usable by the Bank&#13;
&#13;
        I    on a fully convertible basis.&#13;
        I&#13;
                  MR. OVERBY:     That is important.&#13;
&#13;
        I         Mr. Chairman, just to show my impartiality, may I ask&#13;
        I&#13;
             whether the sterling is by any cl'Bnoe going to be made avai labl&#13;
             out of    the~60 million,   or whatever it was, set aside for pro-&#13;
        I&#13;
             jects?&#13;
        I&#13;
                  VISCOUNT HARCOURT:      Mr. Chairman, may I say something on&#13;
        !&#13;
        I&#13;
             18 percent? Ve frequently have these discussions.        I gave up&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                  17&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                 talking a.bout them about a year ago.    I used to answer each&#13;
                 one of them, but I think perhaps at this moment I might say&#13;
                 something a.bout sterling.&#13;
&#13;
                      As far as this loan is concerned, I would like to say&#13;
                 that we have not yet been asked by the Bank whether we would&#13;
                 release it.   We had a tentative inquiry last night whether we&#13;
                 would.   We have not yet had an official request as to whether&#13;
                 we will release sterling.&#13;
                      Secondly, my government is considering at this moment&#13;
                 whether it vi 11.&#13;
                      Thirdly, as regards the general position of sterling 18&#13;
                 percent, unlike some directors who sit around this table, we          I&#13;
                                                                                       1&#13;
        .ii      have not been able to resolve our balance of payment difficult es&#13;
        111&#13;
            I over    the last few years.     Our budgetary difficulties are sever ,&#13;
                                                                                    t&#13;
                                                                                       ,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        !Ii&#13;
        !I'&#13;
        !I but they are child's play compared vi th our balance of payment&#13;
        1&#13;
            1i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        ,11&#13;
&#13;
        !II      difficulties, and I think: the world wi 11 probably realize that&#13;
        ,,,!I&#13;
        i        but in the face of those difficulties I would like to just poi t&#13;
                 out that we have released over half the sterling 18 percent up&#13;
                 to date and, in fact, we are the largest releaser of 18 percen&#13;
                 in dollars, in total sums, after the United States.&#13;
                      Our total re lease -- I haven't got it all in my head, but&#13;
&#13;
                 I think our total releases are 44 million pounds or about 124&#13;
                 million dollars, which is the second largest total of 18 perce t&#13;
&#13;
                 released in the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          18&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
              MR. OVERBY:    As the Directors know, it is a subject dear&#13;
         to my heart, a.nd th!se loans are a little easier to consider&#13;
         if we have greater flexibll.ity in the releases of 18 percent,&#13;
         and I simply like to support the Chairman's heroic efforts to&#13;
         make progress in this field.&#13;
              MR. BLACK:    Mr. Lieftinck.&#13;
              MR. LIEFTINCK:     Mr. Chairman, in this case we are dealin&#13;
        , with a borrower who, to use your own words, is in a comfort-&#13;
         able position.     This is borne out by the information in the&#13;
         reports which show that for the whole development program of&#13;
         this company the financial requirements are 106.8 million dol&#13;
         lars, and inclusive in this proposed loan their available fun s&#13;
&#13;
         will be 123.4 million dollars.&#13;
              So there will be an excess of about, roughly speaking,&#13;
&#13;
         50 million dollars.&#13;
              Now I have asked myself why should the Bank make this&#13;
          loan, such an important loan, of 20 million dollars under the e&#13;
         conditions, and the staff papers clarify this point by point-&#13;
         ing out that the company wants to cover contingencies.&#13;
              There are two kinds of contingencies mentioned, that the&#13;
         construction cost may be exceeded and that the earnings may&#13;
&#13;
         fall short.&#13;
              As far as the construction costs are concerned, it appe          s&#13;
          to me that there are certain inconsistencies in the report be&#13;
         cause it is mentioned that in the project estimates already&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               I&#13;
                                                                            19 I&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
            the contingencies are covered.    These are the construction&#13;
            cost contingencies.&#13;
&#13;
                  As far as the risk that the earnings may fall short of&#13;
            the estimates, it seems to me that the retention price and&#13;
            assurance the company has recently received pretty well covers&#13;
            this contingency.&#13;
&#13;
                  So, I wonder, Mr. Chairman, whether this company is so&#13;
            badly in need of this large amount of 20 million dollars and&#13;
            whether a smaller loan would not meet its requirements.&#13;
                  There is another aspect of the problem.   That is the need!&#13;
            of India for dollars.    I understand that the government has   su~Â­&#13;
                                                                               !&#13;
            ported the company's request in view of the probability that not&#13;
            all these dollars will be needed for this project and some of&#13;
            them might be utilized for other projects.&#13;
                  In this connection, I would like to draw attention to the&#13;
                                                                               i&#13;
            fact, which is not new to you, that the Indian transportation      I&#13;
&#13;
            problem is very pressing and that India will need large amount$&#13;
            of funds for improving its railroad and port system.&#13;
                  I wonder whether or not by reducing this loan more money&#13;
            could be made availble for the transportation projects, and I&#13;
        I would    like you or the staff to explain why you think it justi-&#13;
        1&#13;
        j   fiable and necessary to make available this large amount under&#13;
            present circumstances to this   particular~company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. BASCH:   The point raised by Mr. Lieftinck is well tak n.&#13;
&#13;
            If one goes through the balance sheet and forecasts of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           20&#13;
                                                                                l&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                                        I&#13;
             company one reaches the conclusion the company is in veryÂ· com-I&#13;
             rortable financial position or will be.                             J&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           I&#13;
                  Of course, those are forecasts based on various assumptiops&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;
             as the report explains.&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;
                  Just one assumption vhich I should like to mention is theJ&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;
             company vi 11 be able to raise new sharef. capital of 70 mi llion1&#13;
                                                           ~             .,c. I&#13;
             rupees. It appears now because or changes in ca.pi tal mar~ of     1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             India the company vil l do we 11 if it raises next year one-halfi&#13;
             of this amount.&#13;
                  We felt we shouldn't press the company to go into the&#13;
             market and to issue shares under circumstances which wouldn't&#13;
             be very good or favorable.&#13;
                  Then Mr. Lieftinck mentioned contingencies, reasons for       '&#13;
             the item of contingency.     In the recent negotiations, we disc ss-&#13;
             ed with the company the cost of the price of the various&#13;
        :1   orders and the escalator formula.&#13;
&#13;
        I         In some of the orders, escalator clauses exist.&#13;
        I&#13;
             they do not exist.   Therefore, thecompany could not say exact&#13;
&#13;
        I    what would be the cost of the various equipment now ordered o&#13;
             to be ordered, and the company also asked "Couldn't ve raise&#13;
             the contingency to cover it?"    We didn't feel we ought&#13;
&#13;
             it very much -- slightly more than the previous one.&#13;
                  I should like also to mention that we did not include&#13;
             interest during construct:kn and other charges in the loan.    T y&#13;
             would be paid as we go.    It is not in the amount of the loan.&#13;
&amp;#12;        'I&#13;
                                                                                  21&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                     Finally, this forecast assumed everything will go smooth                 y&#13;
&#13;
                in the company's works.       We have experienced what happened in&#13;
                1953 and   1&#13;
                               54.   The company works could hardly operate because&#13;
                of various labor problems, and so forth.&#13;
                     Nobody knows what will happen in the next year or two or&#13;
                the next three years.       Nobody knows whether because of the&#13;
                ping crisis the company will be in a position to complete as&#13;
                                                                                        i&#13;
&#13;
                foreseen now or the project might not be delayed, which also            i&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        I:&#13;
                                                                                        I&#13;
                will change substantially the character of the forecast.                1&#13;
                                                                                          1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     With regard to transportation vhich Mr. Lieftinck       mentio~d,&#13;
                the Bank is aware of the problem especially in the area where           Ill&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                there a.re the steel mills and the markets.&#13;
                                                       ~&#13;
                     During the negotiation of the 1,1oan, we have obtained&#13;
                special representation from the Government of India,       s~ng&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                the government attaches high priority to this problem, and the&#13;
&#13;
        1&#13;
            1   assured us everything vill be      done~      transportation there&#13;
        11      will be available as needed.&#13;
        11&#13;
        I&#13;
                     Last month, as you know, we had extensive talks here&#13;
        I&#13;
                with the railway people from India, and during these talks we&#13;
        I&#13;
                have tried to explore the problem in this particular area..        We&#13;
                have got substantial amount of the information which makes us&#13;
        I       feel the government railways know the problem and are doing&#13;
&#13;
        ,, what is needed.&#13;
        I,&#13;
                     In addition, the Bank intends to remain in close contact&#13;
        r&#13;
                with the railways, to be informed currently what is the progre s&#13;
&amp;#12;        II&#13;
                                                                                 22&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             of transportation improvements or expansion in th1s particular&#13;
             area.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Lieftinck said that it is perhaps thought by the&#13;
&#13;
             government that dollars for this loan might be used for some-&#13;
&#13;
             thing else.     Of course, this couldn't be done because the amo         t&#13;
             which is for this loan would be disbursed only on the items,&#13;
             orders, for this particular project, not for anything else.&#13;
&#13;
                     Now with regard to railways, as you know, a team of con-&#13;
             sultants is going to India in January, February, to ieview the&#13;
             operations, management, financial position of the railways and&#13;
             afterwards the Bank would consider what could be done in the&#13;
&#13;
             way of helping finance railway projects.&#13;
                     MR. LIEFTINCK:   Mr. Chairman, I am very grateful for this&#13;
&#13;
             information.     As a conservative banker, I would be very hesit         t&#13;
             to supply a borrower with more funds than it properly needs.&#13;
&#13;
             But knowing that you are also a very conservative, conservativ ,&#13;
             perhaps even more conservative than I am, I am satisfied.&#13;
                     MR. BLACK:   We considered this very carefully.   I think&#13;
             you have got a good point there.&#13;
                     I would like to say as a conservative banker we would lik&#13;
&#13;
             to ply a good customer with more money than another customer.&#13;
&#13;
             This is a good customer.&#13;
                     I think the reasons Mr. Basch gave as to the probable&#13;
&#13;
             contingencies, the more likely contingencies under present&#13;
             situations, shipping, and so forth, justify to some extent a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              23&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
              larger amount, plus the overall balance of payment picture of&#13;
              India.&#13;
&#13;
                   So I think that the points you make -- we might make the&#13;
              sum less and the railroads more.&#13;
&#13;
                   Mr. Donner.&#13;
         1i&#13;
         r         DR. DONNER:    I would like to refer to the President's&#13;
        ii&#13;
        Ir&#13;
        ii'&#13;
        if    economic report on part of the economic situation.&#13;
                   In paragraph 17, reference is made to India's external&#13;
&#13;
        I     balance of payments situation.     At the end of this paragraph,&#13;
&#13;
        I we     are told that the government has been forced to take variou&#13;
                                                          ~&#13;
              emergency measures, including tae renewed .pept restrictions an&#13;
              also higher taxation.&#13;
&#13;
                   In a later paragraph, 19, we read that prices haven't&#13;
              risen anyÂ· more in October.    In connection with this, it is&#13;
&#13;
              said that the steadying of prices has been associated with the&#13;
              contraction of money supply.&#13;
                   Since, in paragraph 17, among the measures taken into&#13;
              consideration by the government no reference is given to credit&#13;
              measures, I would like to ask whether this decline in the&#13;
              money supply is due to more rigid monetary policy or whether&#13;
              it is more or less an accidental result of other circumstance ?&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. BASCH:    Taking, first, the last question, the re-&#13;
&#13;
              duction of money supply as it appeared on the date mentioned&#13;
&#13;
              here resulted from the reduction of foreign exchange not offs t&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           24&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                  by the same amount of expansion to the money volume, due&#13;
                  to government indirect borrowing from the Central Bank.&#13;
                           So, I would put it this way:      While the reduction in              gn&#13;
&#13;
                  assets reduced the money volume by a certain amount, at the&#13;
                  same time the Bank of India purchased less government bonds a&#13;
                ,&#13;
                I&#13;
                  that there is a margin of reduction of the money volume.                   1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            :1&#13;
            11&#13;
                           DR. DONNER:     Did the Central   Ban~   purchase leas   1ntent1o~-&#13;
            i!&#13;
             !~   ally, or did it jue t happen?&#13;
            I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I              MR. BASCH:     I wouldn't say it just happened, but we have&#13;
&#13;
            I     statements by the new minister of finance in the recent weeks&#13;
            j&#13;
                  saying something must be done to reduce India's deficit finan&#13;
&#13;
         I        It can't go on like in the present year and, therefore,&#13;
                  measures are being proposed which are being discussed right&#13;
                  now in the Assembly of India.&#13;
                           We haven't elaborated here on     ~e   proposals because we&#13;
                  didn't want to discuss what is being mentioned or debated in&#13;
                  the parliament of India.         We don't know what the final outcom&#13;
                  of it will be.         There are various measures proposed.&#13;
                           DR. DONNER:     But then in reading paragraph 17, we could&#13;
         l&#13;
        rl        have in mind that further policy measures are under considers&#13;
                  ti on.&#13;
        11&#13;
&#13;
        I                  MR. BASCH:    There are.   There are.     And also, if I might&#13;
&#13;
       11&#13;
                  say, the government reduced commitments abroad and purchases,&#13;
&#13;
                  but all these measures will take a few months because at one&#13;
       I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       .I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              25&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             day it was decided to reduce purchases and commitments abroad,&#13;
             but there a.re orders in the pipeline, and they a.re still comin~&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
             in.&#13;
                   So the results of these measures will be seen in a few&#13;
             months.    The same applies also to any import control, excise&#13;
        q duties introduced now, import duties, and so forth.&#13;
        11&#13;
&#13;
        II         DR. DONNER:   Thank you very much.    All I wanted to know      I&#13;
&#13;
        I&#13;
             is whether in addition to the other measures the India Govern&#13;
             ment also considers making use of the market of other countri s.&#13;
&#13;
                   MR. BASCH:    They have been doing so.&#13;
&#13;
                   DR. DONNER:   Yes.&#13;
                   MR. BLACK:    If there are no other questions, I would&#13;
             like to advise the Boa.rd that in this loan we have three&#13;
             banks participating:       the First National City Bank of New&#13;
             York, $466,000; the Irving Trust Company of New York, $466,00 ;&#13;
             and the Philadelphia National Bank, $100,000, or a total of&#13;
             $1,032,000.    These participations will be at a rate of 4-1/2&#13;
&#13;
             percent.&#13;
                   So if there is no further discussion, I would like a&#13;
             motion to adopt the draft resolution as well as approve the&#13;
&#13;
              participation by these banks in this loan.&#13;
                    (Motion duly made, seconded and carried to adopt the&#13;
&#13;
              draft resolution.)&#13;
                   MR. BLACK:    I declare the motion carried.    The loan is&#13;
&#13;
              approved.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        26&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
              Mr. Rao.&#13;
              MR. RAO:    I am grateful, sir, to the Board for having&#13;
         accepted these proposals.      This loan will go very far to sub-&#13;
&#13;
         stantially -- I would say not very far, not adequately, con-&#13;
                                                                             1&#13;
&#13;
         sidering the entire requirements of India, but a good measure       I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         of first installment in the improvement in the total productii&#13;
         of iron and steel in the country.                                   1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              I am very much impressed, and I would like to express my&#13;
         great appreciation of the trouble which the Bank's staff have&#13;
         taken in this matter.    In fact, they seem to know more about&#13;
         these things than most of our own experts.&#13;
              I am indeed very happy to see that they are doing this,&#13;
         and it gives me great confidence that we will solve other&#13;
         problems of the country equally.&#13;
             Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. BLACK:    Thank you.&#13;
