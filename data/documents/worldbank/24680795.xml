&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER ONE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Private investment in agriculture in developing countries, both domestic and foreign,&#13;
has been on the rise for nearly two decades. This paper focuses on large-scale agri-&#13;
cultural projects in developing countries, involving the lease of farmland, which rose&#13;
sharply after the food crisis of 2008. It is important that such investments are sustain-&#13;
able not only in the long term, but also beneï¬&#129;cial in the short term with minimal&#13;
risks or negative eï¬&#128;ects. This paper looks at one approach to achieving this, namely,&#13;
carefully devised contracts with investors, and in doing so oï¬&#128;ers a number of concrete&#13;
solutions.&#13;
&#13;
The paper marries two substantial bodies of research to show how investment con-&#13;
tracts can be set up to promote sustainable development. The paper presents the top&#13;
ï¬&#129;ve positive outcomes and the ï¬&#129;ve downsides from private sector investments in large-&#13;
scale agricultural projects. This is derived from empirical evidence gathered by the&#13;
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World&#13;
Bank after visiting large-scale agricultural projects (UNCTAD and World Bank 2014).&#13;
The paper then proposes legal options to maximizing the main positive outcomes and&#13;
minimizing the main downsides through better drafting of contracts between investors&#13;
and governments for the lease of farmland.1 This is derived from work conducted by&#13;
the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), which studied almost&#13;
80 contracts and produced a guide to negotiating contracts for farmland and water,&#13;
including a model contract (Smaller 2014a).&#13;
&#13;
Investment contracts are one of a number of tools and exist within a broader decision-&#13;
making process. This includes diï¬&#128;erent stages in the investment process, which require&#13;
proper sequencing, prioritizing of issues, and an understanding of the economic con-&#13;
text. Getting this right can be decisive for the success of the investment and can deter-&#13;
mine the extent to which a contract can contribute to generating positive sustainable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 In this context, most often the contract will be between a national government and an investor; however, depending&#13;
on the federal structure and land tenure system of a country, it may be between an investor and another party such&#13;
as a state government, a communal leader, or a customary land holder. The conï¬&#129;guration of parties thus needs to be&#13;
adapted to diï¬&#128;erent contexts.&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER TWO&#13;
THE ROLE OF CONTRACTS IN PROMOTING&#13;
RESPONSIBLE AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENTS&#13;
There are three areas of law that are relevant to foreign investment in agriculture:&#13;
domestic law, contracts, and investment treaties. The best guarantee to achieve positive&#13;
beneï¬&#129;ts from foreign investment is a solid foundation of domestic laws that are prop-&#13;
erly enforced. For example, where rights to land, water, and other natural resources&#13;
are clear and recognized in domestic law, rights holders will be entitled to have a say in&#13;
how to allocate those resources to investors. Domestic laws also govern any other issues&#13;
that may arise in relation to an investment, such as customs procedures for importing&#13;
machinery and exporting ï¬&#129;nished products, taxes, permits for using chemicals and&#13;
fertilizers, and employment.&#13;
&#13;
In many developing countries, however, the necessary domestic laws may not be in&#13;
place or may not be suï¬&#131;ciently detailed. Even when they are in place, they may not be&#13;
implemented or enforced. Domestic laws for environmental and social impact assess-&#13;
ments (ESIAs), for example, exist in most countries, but are either not undertaken or&#13;
treated as a box-ticking exercise (Deininger and Byerlee 2011; UNCTAD and World&#13;
Bank 2014). Ideally, domestic laws will develop to address all issues that may arise in&#13;
relation to an agricultural investment. For now, though, many states still do negotiate&#13;
investment contracts with investors to lease farmland, so they remain a relevant and&#13;
important legal tool.&#13;
&#13;
The second source of law is contracts signed between governments and investors, also&#13;
known as host government agreements. Contracts can help ï¬&#129;ll the gaps in domestic&#13;
laws by providing more detailed guidance on what should be contained in the assess-&#13;
ments, and using international standards and best practice as the reference point. How-&#13;
ever, contracts need to be drafted carefully to maximize beneï¬&#129;ts and reduce risks. This&#13;
includes clearly deï¬&#129;ned rights and obligations, beneï¬&#129;t-sharing arrangements, a plan&#13;
for what happens if things go wrong, and measures to take if one of the parties does&#13;
not fulï¬&#129;ll their commitments. A key challenge when drafting an investment contract&#13;
is to ensure it works in harmony with existing domestic laws. The contract should not&#13;
become a vehicle to bypass or undermine domestic laws, or prevent the development&#13;

Maximizing Gains and Minimizing Risks                                                        3&#13;
&amp;#12;of new laws. Readers, however, need to be aware that no        investment treaties and investment chapters in free trade&#13;
matter how carefully a contract is drafted, ultimately the     agreements (UNCTAD 2014, UNCTAD IIA Database).&#13;

A highly controversial provision found in many investment      can be enforced, a process that has been used by inves-&#13;
contracts, particularly in developing countries, is known as   tors against states nearly 600 times to date (UNCTAD&#13;
a â&#128;&#156;stabilizationâ&#128;&#157; provision. These are clauses in the con-     2014). It is advisable to refer to domestic courts as the&#13;
tracts that freeze domestic laws at the time the contract      forum of choice for disputes arising under the contract,&#13;

compensation for new laws that increase costs or decrease      domestic laws or courts. Treaties should play the smallest&#13;
proï¬&#129;ts. This can include, for example, new environmental       role in the investment process, dealing essentially with&#13;
measures to protect against runoï¬&#128; of pesticides and ferti-     egregious violations, for example, in the case of a gov-&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER THREE&#13;
THREE KEY STAGES&#13;
IN THE CONTRACTING PROCESS&#13;
There are three key stages in the contracting process: (1) preparing for contract nego-&#13;
tiations; (2) negotiating the contract; and (3) monitoring and enforcement of the con-&#13;
tract. Figure 3.1 provides an overview of key issues to be dealt with in each stage.&#13;
These issues are elaborated in chapters 4 and 5 of this paper.&#13;
&#13;
Preparing for the negotiations requires a proper assessment of the suitability and&#13;
availability of land, soil, and water; meaningful inclusion of communities living on&#13;
or around the proposed site; the preparation of feasibility studies and business plans;&#13;
and prescreening or vetting of prospective investors by the host country government.&#13;
&#13;
Negotiating the contract involves deï¬&#129;ning the rights and obligations of the investor&#13;
and the government, stating the applicability of domestic laws, including assignment&#13;
and termination clauses to deal with potential failures, engaging with local communi-&#13;
ties in drafting terms and contract provisions, and deï¬&#129;ning what information about the&#13;
investment will be made public.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and enforcement can be the most challenging stage for governments because&#13;
of limited resources and capacity. The UNCTADâ&#128;&#147;World Bank study found that moni-&#13;
toring by host governments was weak, especially where allocation of land had proceeded&#13;
at a fast pace. Visits by and reporting to government oï¬&#131;cials tended to focus on produc-&#13;
tivity issues rather than monitoring the socioeconomic and environmental impacts.&#13;
&#13;
Setting out clear reporting requirements and indicators in a contract ensures that gov-&#13;
ernments and communities can regularly track whether an investor is fulï¬&#129;lling its obli-&#13;
gations and commitments to the local community. Setting aside a percentage of the&#13;
revenue from the project for implementation issues will help ensure that the govern-&#13;
ment has the capacity to monitor and evaluate the project eï¬&#128;ectively. Transparency&#13;
is a key part of the process of implementing and monitoring the obligations of the&#13;
parties to a contract. Transparency also enables local communities and civil society&#13;
organizations to keep an eye on how the investment is actually playing out on the&#13;
ground and whether promises made in the contract are being kept.&#13;

TOP FIVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM&#13;
FARMLAND INVESTMENTS&#13;
UNCTAD and the World Bank conducted a ï¬&#129;eld survey of 39 large-scale, mature agri-&#13;
business investments in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia (UNCTAD and World&#13;
Bank 2014). The study found that some of these investments have generated positive&#13;
outcomes for host countries and local communities, particularly in terms of employment&#13;
creation. But the beneï¬&#129;ts were not automatic or guaranteed. There were signiï¬&#129;cant&#13;
negative impacts in some investments, particularly related to land rights. The majority&#13;
of investments were generating a combination of positive and negative outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
This section summarizes the key positive ï¬&#129;ndings from the UNCTADâ&#128;&#147;World Bank study&#13;
and shows how they can be enhanced through provisions in the contract. It is about turn-&#13;
ing the investorâ&#128;&#153;s promises into reality. The legal options indicated are not intended to be a&#13;
blueprint. Rather, the aim is to create a â&#128;&#156;wish listâ&#128;&#157; for governments, investors, and commu-&#13;
nities, which will be agreed to in the context of a negotiation. The wish list will be diï¬&#128;erent&#13;
for each project and depend on the size and nature of the project, the domestic legal sys-&#13;
tems, and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s needs and realities. Consultation with communities is essential to&#13;
ensure their voice is heard in developing a wish list that matches local needs and priorities.&#13;
&#13;
EMPLOYMENT CREATION (1)&#13;
 Positive outcome 1: Employment creation&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Employment creation is the key beneï¬&#129;t, and can involve provision of housing, educa-&#13;
     tion, and health care for employees and their families.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ More is needed to improve working conditions, better integrate women, build the skills&#13;
     of the workforce, and increase employment of nationals in senior positions.&#13;
 Legal options:&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Give preference to projects that prioritize womenâ&#128;&#153;s employment when preparing for con-&#13;
     tract negotiations.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Reference domestic and international labor laws in the contract, including conventions&#13;
     for health and safety and the use of forced or child labor.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Include a provision on employment with speciï¬&#129;c targets and requirements to employ&#13;
     locally, hire a percentage of nationals for senior positions, and train the workforce.&#13;

There were a number of negative impacts identiï¬&#129;ed in the UNCTADâ&#128;&#147;World Bank&#13;
study. Some of these negative impacts could have been avoided or minimized through&#13;
better preparations prior to negotiating the contract, through improved drafting of&#13;
contract provisions, or through better monitoring and enforcement. This section&#13;
examines the top ï¬&#129;ve downsides from the UNCTADâ&#128;&#147;World Bank study and how they&#13;
can be addressed through the contracting process.&#13;

The standout negative impact on local communities was reduced access to land. The&#13;
most common source of conï¬&#130;ict was between an investor who was granted formal&#13;
rights to land by the government and the local people who had been living and working&#13;
on land for years, but with rights to land that were typically not surveyed/demarcated&#13;
and/or formally registered. The rights of pastoralists were also seldom recognized&#13;
and therefore a source of conï¬&#130;ict. Many investors were spending signiï¬&#129;cant time and&#13;
resources dealing with land disputes, which could and should have been identiï¬&#129;ed ear-&#13;
lier through a proper preparatory process. Land disputes were closely and directly&#13;

CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Given the right legal and policy frameworks, investments in farmland can generate&#13;
beneï¬&#129;ts and minimize risks for local communities, host states, and investors. The right&#13;
legal framework can help those beneï¬&#129;ts materialize and act as a buttress against poten-&#13;
tial negative impacts. Investment contracts are one tool among a range of other legal&#13;
and policy instruments available. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 summarize the ï¬&#129;ndings of this&#13;
paper in terms of the ways in which the diï¬&#128;erent stages of the contract process can be&#13;
used to maximize the beneï¬&#129;ts and minimize the risks identiï¬&#129;ed by ï¬&#129;eld research. The&#13;
key message is that decisions should be made based on sound evidence and research&#13;
about what works and what does not. This foundation of knowledge should then be&#13;
translated into concrete and detailed provisions in contracts or through other legal&#13;
frameworks and mechanisms applying to the investment. A signiï¬&#129;cant amount of&#13;
groundwork is needed prior to entering into negotiations. Even more work is needed&#13;
after the investment has begun to ensure both parties live up to their commitments.&#13;
Getting all this right is an important step in generating positive sustainable outcomes&#13;
for governments, communities, and investors.&#13;

            Investment contracts for agriculture :
            maximizing gains and minimizing risks
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Private investment in agriculture in
            developing countries, both domestic and foreign, has been on
            the rise for nearly two decades. This paper focuses on
            large-scale agricultural projects in developing countries,
            involving the lease of farmland, which rose sharply after
            the food crisis of 2008. It is important that such
            investments are sustainable not only in the long term, but
            also beneficial in the short term with minimal risks or
            negative effects. This paper looks at one approach to
            achieving this namely, carefully devised contracts with
            investors, and in doing so offers a number of concrete
            solutions. This paper marries two substantial bodies of
            research to show how investment contracts can be set up to
            promote sustainable development. The paper presents the top
            five positive outcomes and the five downsides from private
            sector investments in large scale agricultural projects.
            This is derived from empirical evidence gathered by the
            United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
            and the World Bank after visiting large-scale agricultural
            projects (UNCTAD and World Bank 2014). The paper then
            proposes legal options to maximizing the main positive
            outcomes and minimizing the main downsides through better
            drafting of contracts between investors and governments for
            the lease of farmland. This derived from work conducted by
            the International Institute for Sustainable Development
            (IISD), which studied almost 80 contracts and produced a
            guide to negotiating contracts for farmland and water,
            including a model contract.
