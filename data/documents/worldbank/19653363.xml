In order to estimate the investment needed to provide drinking water               urban areas. Figure 3 shows the gap between the planned annual&#13;
and sanitation services to both urban and rural populations who do                 investments and the annual public-only requirements by subsector.&#13;
not have access, the MAPAS financial tool uses as a reference the WSS&#13;
sector targets set in Hondurasâ&#128;&#153;s National Plan/Country Vision: ensuring            The required investments are significantly higher than the amounts&#13;
95 percent coverage by improved water and sanitation services by                   considered in planning exercises for the WSS sector, and the&#13;
2022. The estimate also takes into account the limited performance of              gaps between planned and required investment are larger than&#13;
existing services, which prevents the service providers from improving             the budgetary resources available. Considering the tight budget&#13;
and expanding by using their own financial resources.                              and limited fiscal space in Honduras, it seems unlikely that the&#13;
                                                                                   investments can be increased to the required levels to achieve the&#13;

            Honduras - Monitoring country progress in
            drinking water and sanitation (MAPAS)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report presents the results of a
            sector analysis and dialogue carried out during the
            implementation of the Monitoring Country Progress in
            Drinking Water and Sanitation (MAPAS) regional initiative in
            Honduras. Statistics mask significant inequalities and
            disparities between urban and rural areas; significant
            majorities of people lacking access to water supply and
            sanitation (WSS) services live in rural areas. The MAPAS
            analysis generated a scorecard which evaluates the service
            delivery pathway in four subsectors of water supply and
            sanitation (WSS): rural water, urban water, rural sanitation
            and hygiene, and urban sanitation and hygiene. The report
            lists priority actions suggested for each subsector. The
            results indicate that it is essential to complete the
            institutional reform process started in 2003 with the
            Framework Law for the Drinking Water and Sanitation Sector.
            Service providers must be strengthened by decentralizing
            urban services to the municipalities and empowering local
            post-construction support mechanisms. All sector
            institutions and decision makers in Honduras emphasized the
            need for an effective governing body and an autonomous
            regulatory authority to: apply sector policies and promote
            coordination between sector institutions and municipalities;
            shift from annual institutional planning to a sector-wide
            programmatic planning approach; use equity criteria to
            direct investment toward underserved populations; grant WSS
            utilities autonomy to recover costs and improve
            sustainability; and incorporate climate change adaptation
            and disaster risk management measures. The financial
            assessment also revealed the need to ensure sufficient funds
            to rehabilitate and replace systems that are approaching the
            end of their lifespan. Finally, ensuring systematic
            compilation of information from all sector agencies is
            critical for investment planning and improvement of WSS services.
