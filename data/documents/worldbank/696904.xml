Terms:                 Standard amortization term, grace period and interest rate for fixed rate US&#13;
dollar single currency loans with an expected disbursement period of 3-6&#13;
years.&#13;
Commitment Fee:        0.75 % on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less any&#13;
waiver.&#13;
Onlending Terms:       The Ministry of Finance would provide funds (US $6.0 million) directly to&#13;
SW payable in 10 years with 4 years of grace at the same interest rate as&#13;
provided by the Bank to the Borrower. The remaining funds of US $200,000&#13;
would be passed on to the Ministry of Environmental Protection.&#13;
Objectives:            The proposed Project would be the fourth Bank environment project (Haapsalu&#13;
and Matsalu Bays in Estonia, Liepaja in Latvia and Klaipeda in Lithuania)&#13;
with the purpose of reducing pollution in the Baltic Sea. The proposed Project&#13;
would forn the first step in taking care of pollution originating from the&#13;
Upper Lielupe River Basin, which is a major water pollution source into the&#13;
Gulf of Riga portion of the Baltic Sea. The overall purpose of the Project is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii-&#13;
to address point and non-point pollution sources in the Upper Lielupe River&#13;
Basin and to foster its environmentally sustainable management and&#13;
development while also promoting regional environmental cooperation. The&#13;
main objectives are to: (a) reduce the pollution load from the Siauliai area into&#13;
the Upper Lielupe River Basin, thus significantly decreasing the pollution&#13;
loads of this transboundary river into the Gulf of Riga; (b) improve the&#13;
quality, reliability, and cost efficiency of water supply and wastewater services&#13;
in the Municipality of Siauliai; (c) establish a financially sustainable provision&#13;
of municipal services; and (d) improve the regional and local environmental&#13;
quality monitoring programs and enforcement systems in the Upper Lielupe&#13;
River Basin.&#13;
Program Category&#13;
Objectives:             The proposed Project would promote environmentally sustainable development&#13;
through regional environmental cooperation and the strengthening of regional&#13;
and local environmental institutions complemented by investments in&#13;
infrastructure and specialized equipment.&#13;
Description:            The proposed Project would be implemented over four years and would have&#13;
two complementary components: a Water and Wastewater Improvement&#13;
Component (WWIC) and an Environmental Management Component (EMC).&#13;
The WWIC would include: (a) rehabilitation of selected elements of the&#13;
existing water and wastewater systems in Siauliai; (b) construction of a new&#13;
water treatment facility for a major well field (iron removal); (c) completion&#13;
of the new, partially constructed wastewater treatment plant; and (d)&#13;
institutional strengthening and training of Siauliai Water (SW), which would&#13;
include a twinning arrangement incorporating advisory services, training, and&#13;
information technology.&#13;
The EMC would consist of: (a) institutional support for the Lithuanian side of&#13;
the "Lielupe River Commission" jointly run by Latvia and Lithuania, through&#13;
training, technical assistance, equipment and software, and a twinning&#13;
arrangement with a foreign river basin management organization; (b)&#13;
improvement of the regional environmental monitoring through technical and&#13;
financial support to Siauliai and Panevezys Regional Environmental Protection&#13;
Offices, including technical assistance, training and monitoring and laboratory&#13;
equipment; (c) implementation of a management plan and procedures to&#13;
monitor industrial discharges; (d) development of a plan for sludge&#13;
management; (e) technical and financial support for selected demonstration&#13;
activities for cost effective approaches for pollution control at major pig farms&#13;
and improved methods for agricultural run-off control. Complementary&#13;
institutional strengthening and monitoring activities in Latvia are anticipated&#13;
to be supported by donors and carried out separately.&#13;
Project Benefits:       The proposed Project is a necessary step for the GoLI to fulfill its obligations&#13;
under the international treaty of HELCOM. Without the proposed Project,&#13;
they would not be able to reduce water pollution originating from Lithuania,&#13;
as agreed in the treaty. The benefits from the proposed Project are considered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
to be not only national, but regional and it has been included in the country's&#13;
Public Investment Program, endorsed by the Parliament. The direct economic&#13;
benefits of the proposed Project are difficult to quantify. The tangible&#13;
benefits include positive impact on health, implying lower health care costs,&#13;
and positive impact on tourism, implying increased tourism revenues. In&#13;
addition, short term direct benefits, include employment opportunities for&#13;
Lithuanian technical experts, skilled workers and laborers during the&#13;
construction period of the proposed Project. The non tangible benefits are&#13;
more difficult to capture in monetary terms, although it is clear that the net&#13;
development impact from the proposed Project is clearly positive. The non-&#13;
tangible benefits of the project would include: (a) significant improvement in&#13;
the water quality of the tributary river that runs into the Lielupe River, thus&#13;
reducing transboundary pollution into Latvia and ultimately into the Gulf of&#13;
Riga; (b) improvement in the quality and reliability of the water and&#13;
wastewater services in Siauliai; (c) efficient, full cost-recovery pricing of&#13;
water and wastewater services; (d) creation of a financially autonomous&#13;
"model" utility providing cost effective municipal services supplemented by&#13;
an adequate social safety net; (e) enhanced regional environmental cooperation&#13;
and coordination, thus improved preparedness for control of emergency&#13;
situations; (f) improved aesthetic conditions around the river and expanded&#13;
domestic tourism through recreational use of areas along the river and at&#13;
Jurmala by the Gulf of Riga; (g) better evaluation of problems and&#13;
management of surface water and regulatory enforcement; and (h)&#13;
demonstration of low cost control measures for agricultural run-off.&#13;
Environmental&#13;
Screening:              The proposed Project has been placed in environmental screening category&#13;
"B". An environmental review, consistent with the provisions of the Bank's&#13;
Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" and the applicable&#13;
environmental assessment procedures of the Government of Lithuania (GoLI),&#13;
has been prepared for the WWIC and has been reviewed by MoEP.&#13;
Supplemental environmental reviews would be prepared as part of the detailed&#13;
planning process for activities supported under the EMC. The proposed&#13;
Project would not involve involuntary resettlement and is not anticipated to&#13;
have an impact on known archaeological or historical sites in Siauliai or other&#13;
proposed Project areas.&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
Management:             The proposed Project is consistent with the Bank's Water Resources&#13;
Management Policy by supporting actions to improve the long-term&#13;
management of this resource through institutional development and&#13;
complementary investment activities.&#13;
International&#13;
Waterways&#13;
OD 7.50:                A legal notification by the MoEP to the Latvian Ministry of Environment and&#13;
Regional Development concerning the proposed Project has been carried out&#13;
in accordance with the Operational Directive 7.50, "Projects on International&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
Waterways." The Government of Latvia (GoLA) has expressed its strong&#13;
support for the proposed Project.&#13;
Participatory&#13;
Approach:               The preparation of the proposed Project has involved a series of meetings with&#13;
representatives of the national government, local authorities, and experts&#13;
concerning the findings and recommendations of the consultants and the scope&#13;
and objectives of the proposed Project. Workshops were held at which&#13;
interested parties reviewed and discussed the proposed project. These&#13;
meetings have been given local coverage in the press, television, and radio.&#13;
Risks:                  The overall risks of the proposed Project include: (a) implementation delays&#13;
due to inexperience with Bank procedures for procurement, accounting, and&#13;
disbursement; (b) overrun of construction costs due to the limited experience&#13;
with actual implementation costs, the volatility of local prices, and previous&#13;
lack of experience with construction activities executed to international&#13;
standards; (c) problems with timely provision of local funding. Risks for the&#13;
WWIC include: (a) possible increase of leakages from the water supply&#13;
distribution network due to insufficient investments in rehabilitation; (b) lack&#13;
of political commitment and ability of MS to approve required tariff&#13;
adjustments; (c) difficulties for SW to collect tariff revenues from consumers;&#13;
and (d) strong opposition for the organizational restructuring by Siauliai City&#13;
Council and/or employees. Risks for the EMC include: (a) inadequate&#13;
international cooperation in the International Lielupe River Basin Commission;&#13;
(b) inadequate coordination of activities between MoEP, MoF, the two&#13;
concerned REPOs, SMEO, local governments, nongovernmental organizations&#13;
and other parties; and (c) resistance from local authorities and private&#13;
landowners to proposed land use control measures.&#13;
In general, risks would be minimized through close Bank supervision and&#13;
adequate project management arrangements. The overall Project risks would&#13;
be minimized by: (a) establishment of a strong PIU whose staff would receive&#13;
training in Bank procurement and disbursement procedures.; (b) project design&#13;
based on conservative approaches to cost estimation combined with the use of&#13;
appropriate physical and price contingencies; and (c) close supervision of&#13;
monthly disbursements of local funding and availability of interim measures&#13;
to bridge local tax collection shortfalls. Risks for the WWIC would be&#13;
minimized by: (a) additional funding for network rehabilitation in the second&#13;
phase of investments; (b) adequate governance structure for SW and decision&#13;
authority for tariff adjustments; (c) extension of the social safety net for low&#13;
income households to mitigate negative impact of tariff adjustments (d)&#13;
institutional strengthening of SW to improve its financial management, billing&#13;
and collection practices; and (e) participation of employees in the&#13;
organizational restructuring. Risks for the EMC would be minimized through:&#13;
(a) a well defined framework for routine cooperation between Latvia and&#13;
Lithuania in the International Lielupe River Basin Commission; (b)&#13;
establishment of implementation teams for each sub-component; and (c) direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v &#13;
public participation in the planning and implementation of proposed&#13;
"demonstration" activities for the pig farms and agricultural runoff activities.&#13;
Government of Lithuania has selected US dollar loan terms because its&#13;
currency is pegged to the US dollar and more than 60% of its foreign&#13;
exchange revenues are in US dollars. Onlending from the Borrower to SW&#13;
would be in US dollars. Siauliai Water has no foreign exchange revenues and&#13;
consequently bears a currency risk when borrowing in foreign currency.&#13;
Under the agreed tariff setting formula, SW would pass on all cost of&#13;
borrowing to the final consumers. SW's cash flow is allowing for a relatively&#13;
short repayment period of the subsidiary loan from the Borrower to SW (10&#13;
years) which would reduce the time during which SW is exposed to the&#13;
exchange risk.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1          Background. Lithuania is the southernmost and largest of the Baltic countries. It covers&#13;
65,000 square kilometers and has a population of about 3.8 million. About 600,000 people live in the&#13;
capital, Vilnius. During the Soviet period, Lithuania industrialized rapidly. It had a strong economy based&#13;
on specialized industries and agriculture, and was fully integrated into the larger Soviet system. The major&#13;
industries were machine building, metal working, textile, leather and wood processing, and agro-&#13;
processing, all of which were geared toward export within the Soviet system. While Lithuania does not&#13;
have abundant natural resources, it has inherited a highly skilled workforce and relatively well-developed&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
1.2          Macroeconomic Situation and Future Outlook.  Since independence in 1991, the&#13;
Government of Lithuania (GoLI) has pursued a reform program aimed at reorienting its economy from a&#13;
centrally planned to a market system. Progress towards this goal has been substantial, particularly in the&#13;
areas of price and trade liberalization, currency and tax reform, privatization, and the development of the&#13;
social safety net. However, the transition has not always been smooth, Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product&#13;
(GDP) has declined more than half since independence. A formal macro-economic program was launched&#13;
in 1991, supported by two International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangements (in October 1991 and&#13;
October 1993), based on strict fiscal policy and tight monetary policy.&#13;
1.3          GDP began to stabilize in the second half of 1993 and the economy is expected to continue&#13;
to improve. Economic growth of GDP was positive in 1994 and is expected to rise to 5 % in 1995 before&#13;
stabilizing around 4% per year over the medium term. Projected average growth for the period 1994-2000&#13;
is close to 4.5%, which would imply a recovery to pre-independence income levels around year 2010.&#13;
This recovery is partly reflected in the increased trade volumes since mid-1993. Annual inflation was&#13;
estimated at about 1,020% in 1992 but has declined steadily, except for brief temporary increases in late&#13;
1993 and May 1994 related largely to energy price increases and the introduction of a Value Added Tax&#13;
(VAT). Annual average inflation for 1994 was 72%, and is expected to decline to 37% in 1995, and to&#13;
continue to decline gradually over future years. In mid April 1994, the Government pegged the Litas (the&#13;
national currency introduced in mid 1993), to the dollar, and instituted a new currency board to eliminate&#13;
the scope for discretionary monetary policy and to create a supportive environment for fiscal measures to&#13;
be effective. Capital inflows averaged some $20 million per month during 1994.&#13;
1.4          Industry and farming are the largest economic sectors in Lithuania. In 1993, agriculture&#13;
accounted for about 21 % of GDP while industry accounted for about 27%. Production of meat and milk&#13;
and breeding of cattle and pigs are the most important sources of income for the Lithuanian farms. The&#13;
majority of industrial enterprises in Lithuania are engaged in the production of machinery and machine&#13;
parts, processed foods, and light industrial products such as textiles, apparel, leather, furniture and&#13;
household appliances. However, both the agricultural and industrial sectors have suffered a significant&#13;
decline of activity since 1991 from the disruption of trading relations with Russia and other FSU countries.&#13;
It is estimated that much of the decline in industrial output took place by the end of 1992. In 1994, it is&#13;
estimated that average capacity utilization of enterprises was only 46.5%. Nevertheless, industrial&#13;
production in the state sector had more or less stabilized in early 1993, and given the growth in the private&#13;
sector, which still remains partly unrecorded, it is estimated that total industrial output increased during&#13;
the course of 1993 and early 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.5          The estimated per capita income level in 1994 was US $1,350. There is an increasing&#13;
disparity of incomes between those benefiting from a growing market economy and those, such as&#13;
pensioners and the unemployed, whose incomes are fixed. In addition, the income gap is widening&#13;
between urban and rural populations. The Lithuanian Bureau of Statistics estimates the nationwide&#13;
unemployment in March, 1995 at 5.7%.  This figure, however, could conceal an unrecorded&#13;
unemployment as many bankrupt large state owned enterprises, are unable to either pay their employees&#13;
or, because of legal constraints cannot release them from employment. The Government is committed to&#13;
the development of a comprehensive social protection program. Whereas it is focusing on re-designing&#13;
and systematizing the social safety net system; progress is being made on the design of a new consumption&#13;
basket to be used as the basis for targeting social assistance; finally, the unemployment system is being&#13;
restructured to cope more effectively with the expected rise in unemployment.&#13;
1.6          Pnivatization. Privatization -- except of land -- is moving at a reasonable pace. Although&#13;
the Government's program aimed at completing enterprise privatization by the end of 1994, only the&#13;
privatization of small enterprises was completed by that time. Privatization, through issuance of vouchers&#13;
to the public, is expected to be completed during 1995. As of June 30 1995, approximately 5,620 of&#13;
Lithuania's 6,700 state-owned enterprises marked for privatization had been sold. The remaining non-&#13;
privatized state property will be privatized commercially. The privatization of agricultural enterprises and&#13;
the process of land restitution is proceeding slowly, and the development of a land market remains impaired&#13;
by restrictions on land use. Efforts to privatize the state enterprise sector has had mixed success, although&#13;
the Lithuanian authorities have, in order to facilitate eventual privatization, undertaken several initiatives&#13;
to create independent, commercially-oriented entities from previous state-owned conglomerates and large&#13;
enterprises. Contraction and restructuring of inefficient agricultural and industrial activities, characterized&#13;
by out-dated technology and excess capacity, remain slow.&#13;
1.7          Bank Activities in the Country. The main objective of the Bank's country assistance&#13;
strategy for Lithuania is to support an acceleration of the economic transformation towards a market system&#13;
and a recovery of output and export growth and living standards. In this context, investments to improve&#13;
public services and infrastructure are crucial. The Public Expenditure Review (PER) issued in July 1994,&#13;
jointly prepared by the GoLI and the Bank, emphasizes infrastructure rehabilitation as a priority area. To&#13;
date the Bank has provided the GoLI with a Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3524-LT) of US $60 million in&#13;
October 1992, and as a result of the need to support priority investments in energy and environmental&#13;
services, including improved water supply and wastewater treatment, the Bank approved the Power&#13;
Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3737-LT) for US $26.4 million in May 1994, the Klaipeda Environment Loan&#13;
(No. 3816-LT) for US $7 million in December 1994, and the Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance&#13;
Loan (No. 3866-LT) for US $25 million in April 1995.&#13;
1.8          Given the presence of numerous active donors and lenders in Lithuania, the CAS&#13;
emphasizes the importance of aid coordination. In all sectors in which the Bank is active, close contact&#13;
is maintained with the bilateral donors and other major international institutions in order to coordinate areas&#13;
of emphasis for lending and to mobilize cofinancing and technical assistance. In the case of the&#13;
environment sector, this has included coordination on the preparation of studies, provision of technical&#13;
support and investment assistance by EU(Life), EU(Phare), NEFCO, Nordic Investment Bank, Denmark,&#13;
Finland, Sweden and the United States.&#13;
&#13;

B. Sectoral Context&#13;
1.9          Institutional Setting. The central environmental protection authority in Lithuania is the&#13;
Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP) which was established in June 1994 and is the successor to&#13;
the Environmental Protection Department. The MoEP is responsible for: (a) formulating and implementing&#13;
Lithuania's policy for environmental protection and natural resource use; (b) supervising environmental&#13;
assessment procedures; (c) establishing environmental standards and guidelines; and (d) administering and&#13;
enforcing environmental protection and natural resource use throughout Lithuania, and the nation's Baltic&#13;
Sea economic zone.&#13;
1.10         Under the overall guidance of the MoEP, eight Regional Environmental Protection Offices&#13;
(REPO) with environmental laboratories are responsible for enforcing environmental regulations, issuing&#13;
permits for projects and providing public information services to the local governments. Given the current&#13;
44 administrative regions in Lithuania, each REPO covers several administrative regions'. These units are&#13;
under the administration of the respective municipality. The principal functions of the REPO's are: (a)&#13;
determination of natural resource use and pollution charges; (b) pollution monitoring; (c) inspection for&#13;
compliance with requirements; (d) imposition of penalties for non-compliance; and (e) negotiation of steps&#13;
towards compliance.&#13;
1.11         Overall strengthening of the MoEP is provided by EU(Phare) and bilateral donors. A&#13;
National Environmental Action Plan is being prepared with support from EU(Phare). The GoLI has&#13;
recently requested donor grant support, on a grant basis, for the implementation of a National&#13;
Environmental Monitoring and Laboratory System Program developed with technical support from the&#13;
United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) (see para. 1.17).&#13;
1.12         International legislative framework. Lithuania is party to a number of international&#13;
environmental conventions and treaties. It has signed and ratified the "Convention on the Protection of&#13;
the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area" ("Helsinki Convention"), which obliges it to undertake&#13;
concrete actions to reduce marine pollution from land based sources and to implement a wide range of&#13;
recommendations on various environmental matters developed by the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM).&#13;
In this context, Lithuania has been an active participant in many programs of HELCOM, including the&#13;
Programme Implementation Task Force (PITF) which is responsible for coordinating implementation of&#13;
the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Program (JCP) adopted in 1992. In addition,&#13;
Lithuania has adhered to, or is taking steps to, meet requirements of the Bern, Ramsar, and other&#13;
Conventions concerning the conservation of animal and plant species including their critical habitats and&#13;
wetlands. It is also active in the Environmental Action Programme for Central and Eastern Europe and&#13;
the environmental working groups of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).&#13;
1.13         National legislativeframework. Environmental legislation is still under development in&#13;
Lithuania. The current transitional status of the country is characterized by a combination of administrative&#13;
procedures, legislation and standards that were in use before independence and some new laws and&#13;
provisions stipulated by the GoLI. There are eight laws directly related to environmental protection. The&#13;
General Environmental Protection Law, passed in 1992, is the core of the system. Nine other&#13;
complementary laws are under preparation and review. The most important of these are: the Law on&#13;
1      Some cities have recently established Municipal Environment Offices to complement the REPO's.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment, about to be submitted to Parliament; the Waste Management Law, also&#13;
close to completion; and the Marine Environmental Protection Law, now under consideration in&#13;
Parliament. The Law on Protected Areas was promulgated in 1993, while a number of new laws, including&#13;
ones on air quality, water quality, and the protection of wild life and the protection of vegetation, are under&#13;
preparation.&#13;
1.14         Current environmental standards in Lithuania are mostly those inherited from the Soviet&#13;
system, which include almost 4,000 water quality standards applied which together are more stringent than&#13;
those of the European Union or the United States. As a result of the stringency of the water quality&#13;
standards, the monitoring of these standards was considered to be impossible, and the enforcement of&#13;
environmental standards was, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. Given Lithuania's participation&#13;
in various international environmental conventions, in particular HELCOM, the GoLI is currently in the&#13;
process of establishing a system of environmental standards reflecting European Union norms.&#13;
1.15         The pollution control policy in Lithuania relies on a mix of command and control regulation&#13;
and economic incentives. Every industrial unit in Lithuania, including water supply and wastewater&#13;
treatment utilities, must obtain a permit to use natural resources and to discharge pollutants in the&#13;
environment. For water, the natural resource permit specifies the quantity of water that the industrial unit&#13;
can consume during a given time period for which the firm has to pay a tax as specified by the "Law on&#13;
Taxes on the Use of Natural Resources" (No. 190, March 1991) which is collected by the MoEP and paid&#13;
into the national budget. With respect to water discharges, the MoEP regulates only discharges directly&#13;
into the environment. When a firm discharges pollutants into a municipal sewage network, the regulation&#13;
of those discharges is the responsibility of the municipality or the receiving wastewater treatment plant.&#13;
The "Law on Taxes on Environmental Pollution" (April 1992) defines pollution fees as well as penalties&#13;
for violations. The pollution permit obtained by the industrial unit serves as a basis to calculate the rate&#13;
at which emissions of pollution are going to be taxed. Pollution charges are paid to the state tax authorities:&#13;
70% are allocated to the Municipal Environmental Protection Fund, and 30% to national budget. All fines&#13;
are paid into the State Environmental Protection Fund. The monitoring and enforcement of permit&#13;
conditions is carried out by the relevant REPO.&#13;
1.16         Monitoring. The national water quality monitoring system currently in place in Lithuania&#13;
includes approximately 45 monitoring stations for receiving water quality measurements from&#13;
approximately 2,600 discharge points. The REPOs have each an inspection unit supported by a laboratory.&#13;
However, the laboratory equipment at most locations is considered old and obsolete. Consequently,&#13;
samples are difficult to process accurately and in a timely manner. Moreover, there is no nation-wide&#13;
accreditation policy for such laboratories. Hence, despite the fact that emission data are collected from&#13;
approximately 2,000 sources, systematic emissions monitoring is limited. There are no protocols for&#13;
monitoring methods, and point-source emission data are not necessarily integrated into regional pollution&#13;
patterns. In addition, although regulated industrial polluters must submit their emission data to REPOs on&#13;
a monthly or quarterly basis, a vast majority of regulated industries lack self-monitoring equipment.&#13;
Hence, most data submitted to REPOs are estimated on the basis of emissions factors.&#13;
1.17         A recent United States financed project to evaluate the Lithuanian air and water monitoring&#13;
programs and the laboratory capability necessary to support those programs, provides the following main&#13;
findings and recommendations:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
(a)   that substantial investment in new laboratory equipment, physical plant and sampling&#13;
apparatus is needed to supply the monitoring programs with a minimum capability to detect&#13;
pollutants at levels consistent with existing and emerging standards; and&#13;
(b)   that organizational and procedural changes need to be taken to optimize data collection,&#13;
analysis, and data management, mainly:&#13;
*     steps should be taken to develop and implement a rigorous Data Quality&#13;
Management Program to improve the quality and the documentation of the&#13;
precision of the environmental data; and&#13;
*     environmental monitoring, data quality and, environmental database&#13;
management protocols and standards should be coordinated not only on&#13;
a national basis but also on an international basis to address common&#13;
watershed issues.&#13;
1.18         Country Environmental Policy and Strategy. Lithuania's environmental problems are&#13;
concentrated in the urban industrial areas, and improvements in water and wastewater services are one of&#13;
the priorities. A National Environmental Strategy is under preparation with EU (Phare) support and is&#13;
expected to be finalized in 1996. At a Bank sponsored "Public Expenditure Conference" held in May&#13;
1994, the Lithuanian Prime Minister noted that the GoLI has established the following intersectoral&#13;
investment priorities, taking into account the impact on human health, loss of productivity, risk of&#13;
irreversible ecological damage and economic efficiency of funds involved: (a) reduction of water pollution,&#13;
with an emphasis on construction of wastewater treatment plants, as water pollution, resulting from&#13;
organic, nitrogen and phosphorus loads from point and non-point sources, is one of Lithuania's most&#13;
serious environmental problems; (b) hazardous waste management, including construction of regional&#13;
temporary storage sites and later construction of hazardous waste treatment facilities; and (c) clean-up of&#13;
contaminated sites which pose the most serious threat to public health and environment. The GoLI also&#13;
seeks to maintain Lithuania's rich biodiversity through protection of areas of critical habitat and by&#13;
undertaking activities to reduce pollution from agricultural sources. To fulfill these goals the GoLI seeks&#13;
to effectively coordinate donor funding available for environmental activities by promoting cooperation&#13;
between donors and multilateral actors.&#13;
1.19         Water Supply and Wastewater Services. About 90% of Lithuanian urban households&#13;
receive piped water, while the rural communities mostly extract water from private wells. Average water&#13;
consumption per capita has been estimated at 250 liter/day, which is relatively high compared to an average&#13;
of 175 liter/day in western European countries. This high consumption is partially encouraged by the&#13;
absence of metering, but can also be explained by leakages in the water distribution system which in&#13;
general is in poor condition. Leakage rates of drinking water are estimated at approximately 25-35 % and&#13;
can be as high as 50% in some water supply systems.&#13;
1.20         Groundwater is utilized for drinking water in the major urban and industrial areas due to&#13;
widespread pollution of surface water and shallow groundwater. In general, deep groundwater supplies&#13;
are of good quality and require only limited treatment before consumption. Of the shallow groundwater&#13;
wells in rural areas, used by more than one million people, existing data suggest about 77 % are over the&#13;
EU limits for bacteriological and nutrient contamination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.21          About 80% of urban households are connected to piped sewerage systems. Most existing&#13;
wastewater treatment plants are severely overloaded, resulting in large portions of their flow being&#13;
discharged after partial treatment or being bypassed with no treatment. Existing sewerage systems are in&#13;
poor condition, leading to groundwater contamination and an imminent risk of contaminating the water&#13;
supply system through infiltration into the water pipes. In addition, infiltration of groundwater and surface&#13;
run off into the sewer system increases wastewater flows, causing additional overloading of the treatment&#13;
plants.&#13;
1.22          Responsibilities for urban services, including water and wastewater services have been&#13;
passed to municipalities as part of the process of decentralization. Since March, 1995, as the result of a&#13;
new national legislation, state owned water and wastewater utilities have been turned into municipally&#13;
owned, limited joint stock companies. Although the law allows for the privatization of up to 30 % of the&#13;
stock of the utilities, these are currently owned entirely by the respective municipality. A separate law has&#13;
established municipal authority for setting the water and wastewater tariffs. The GoLI has reserved its right&#13;
to intervene (in some specified occasions) in municipal tariff policy.&#13;
1.23          In the past, wastewater tariffs were set to cover only operation and maintenance costs, and&#13;
were not allowed to be set higher in order to accumulate funds for capital construction or repair. The&#13;
legislation has now changed, enabling the municipalities gradually to move from fully subsidized&#13;
investments to full cost recovery and to enter the commercial loan market for financing. Currently, based&#13;
on declared priorities, the main part of the National Environmental Protection Fund out of the State budget&#13;
has been allocated to investments in the rehabilitation and expansion of wastewater treatment facilities.&#13;
1.24          In the PER, a "Five Cities Program" for reducing water pollution was adopted. The&#13;
program includes: Kaunas, Klaipeda, Palanga, Siauliai and Vilnius. All of these projects are either&#13;
approved or under preparation: (a) Kaunas, supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (EBRD); (b) Klaipeda, supported by the World Bank; (c) Palanga, self-financed; (d) Vilnius,&#13;
supported by Danish assistance; and (e) Siauliai, the proposed Project. The MoEP plans to undertake&#13;
"second-generation" water and wastewater projects which would address the needs of the secondary cities,&#13;
towns, and settlements.&#13;
1.25          Agricultural Pollution. Although the agricultural activities in Lithuania have declined,&#13;
agricultural run-off contributea significantly to the overall load of water pollution from Lithuania. The run-&#13;
off results from the application and storage of manure and fertilizer, the application of pesticides, and from&#13;
livestock operations. Pollution of surface and groundwater resources by manure and fertilizer is caused by:&#13;
(a) poor application technology; (b) problems with fertilizer balance for specific fields; (c) poor tillage&#13;
practices that fail to incorporate manure and fertilizer into the soil; and (d) open and unsealed storage&#13;
facilities. Pesticide pollution problems are associated with improper application, poor storage practices,&#13;
and inappropriate disposal of containers.&#13;
1.26          Lithuanian authorities want action to be taken to promote improved agricultural practices&#13;
to control current problems and as economic recovery accelerates, to avoid a resurgence of problems of&#13;
excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. To achieve this objective, Lithuania has undertaken cooperative&#13;
applied research and demonstration programs for management of agricultural run-off with support from&#13;
Denmark, Sweden, and the United States. Lithuania also hosted a Baltic regional conference on the&#13;
management of agricultural run-off in 1993, to support the establishment of a regional network of model&#13;
catchment areas and promote the exchange of experience in addressing these concerns in agricultural&#13;
extension programs.&#13;

C. The Project Area&#13;
1.27         The Lielupe River and River Basin. The Lielupe River is the trunk river formed at the&#13;
convergence of the two main tributaries, Musa and Memele which flow through Lithuania. The Lielupe&#13;
River is the second largest river2 discharging into the Gulf of Riga, close to the city of Jurmala, 20 km west&#13;
of Riga. The Lielupe River Basin covers a land area of more than 17,500 km2. This land is almost equally&#13;
distributed between Latvia and Lithuania. A total of about 843,000 people live within the borders of the&#13;
Lielupe basin, 58% on the Lithuanian side. The land of the river basin is mainly used for agriculture&#13;
(about 55% of the basin area), while forests cover approximately 30% of the basin. The Upper Lielupe&#13;
River Basin is roughly 50% of the total drainage area of the Lielupe River. The Lithuanian part of the&#13;
Lielupe basin comprises two regions and 11 administrative districts, of which four are entirely situated&#13;
within the basin. The two regions are Siauliai and Panevezys.&#13;
1.28         Pollution discharges into the river basin have now reached such levels that there is a public&#13;
health problem: most sections of the river are unsuitable for recreational use, and several beaches on the&#13;
Latvian coast at Jurmala, the country's main summer resort area, have been closed for swimming for&#13;
several years as a direct result of pollution from the Lielupe River. The discharge from the Lielupe basin&#13;
constitutes 12% of the total discharge, and 20% of the nitrate transports to the Gulf of Riga. The largest&#13;
pollution point source in the Lielupe River basin is the city of Siauliai in Lithuania. Its discharges have&#13;
major adverse effects throughout the basin and the Gulf of Riga. Pollution sources on the Latvian side of&#13;
the river basin are geographically more dispersed. The main non-point source pollution is leakage of&#13;
nitrogen and phosphorous from agricultural land. Even though livestock production has declined within&#13;
the basin, four major integrated pig breeding, butchering, and marketing complexes (each producing on&#13;
average 20,000 animals per year) remain in the Lithuanian watershed constituting an important source of&#13;
pollution.&#13;
1.29         Lielupe River Basin Commission. In 1991, the "Lielupe River Project" was started between&#13;
the Ministries of Environment of Latvia and Lithuania with the long-term objectives of: (a) demonstrating&#13;
the feasibility of cooperative river basin management in the context of the Baltic Sea region; (b)&#13;
establishment of a joint water quality data base; and (c) development of pollution abatement actions plans.&#13;
Cooperation between the two countries has been quite effective and a basic inventory of sources and levels&#13;
of pollution has been completed. This international project has been supported by the Government of&#13;
Sweden as a contribution to the Baltic Sea Environment Program. The Swedish Environmental Research&#13;
Institute - IVL3 has served as the Swedish counterpart organization for project implementation.&#13;
1.30         On the basis of initial experience with this cooperative project, the Ministries of&#13;
Environment of Latvia and Lithuania signed the "Agreement on Environmental Management of the Lielupe&#13;
River Basin" in May 1993 which established the "Lielupe River Basin Commission." The Commission&#13;
takes the form of a "joint commission" composed of two delegations: (a) Latvia - Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Regional Development, Jelgava Environmental Protection Committee and the Riga Environmental&#13;
Protection Committee; and (b) Lithuania - Ministry of Environmental Protection, Panevezys Regional&#13;
Environmental Protection Department and Siauliai Regional Environmental Protection Department. The&#13;
functions and powers of the Commission include the coordination of cooperative actions to protect the&#13;
2      (after the Daugava River).&#13;

Lielupe River, by national and local governments within the drainage basin; preparation of cooperative&#13;
studies and investigations; and preparation of any future agreements. To date the work of the Commission&#13;
has focused on data collection and baseline monitoring in the context of the cooperative program between&#13;
Latvia. The Governments of Latvia and Lithuania have expressed to the Bank their interest in having the&#13;
Commission become fully operational and to expand the scope of their cooperation to include the&#13;
implementation of priority actions. Priorities for future action include making the Commission operational&#13;
at the national and field levels, establishing a permanent monitoring system, providing information to&#13;
support pollution control investments, promoting demonstration activities to control small scale point and&#13;
non-point source pollution, and development of an effective emergency warning system.&#13;
1.31          Siauliai. The city of Siauliai is situated in northeast Lithuania, some 150 km inland from&#13;
the Baltic coast and about 50 km from the border with Latvia. The region surrounding Siauliai is flat and&#13;
crisscrossed by a large number of small rivers, forming the upper reaches of the Lielupe River Basin.&#13;
Siauliai is situated on one of the smaller tributaries, the Kulpe, which is about three meters across and less&#13;
than a meter deep when it reaches the city. All of the city municipal and industrial wastewater is&#13;
discharged into the Kulpe River and, in summer, often constitutes its entire flow. The Kulpe flows&#13;
distressingly within 10 meters of the "Hill of Crosses", the principal tourist site near Siauliai and an&#13;
important holy and national shrine for Lithuanians.&#13;
1.32          With a current population of 147,000, Siauliai is the fourth largest city in Lithuania. The&#13;
population is expected to increase slowly over the next decade to reach approximately 150,000 in year&#13;
2000. The city's economic base is mainly industrial, the dominant industry being the food processing&#13;
industry. The majority of the industries are now operating considerably below capacity, and the&#13;
restructuring of the economy makes it almost impossible to predict with accuracy which of these industries&#13;
are likely to survive in a market economy. However, there are indications that a number of industries, in&#13;
particular the brewery, some of the food-related industries, and the bicycle factory could succeed.&#13;
1.33          According to the Statistics Office of the Municipality of Siauliai, approximately 88,000&#13;
individuals are of working age of which about only 50,000 are employed working in private and state&#13;
enterprises. Pensioners and those under sixteen years of age are the other two groups of people with&#13;
approximately 25,000 and 35,000 individuals respectively. Thirty-five percent of the working population&#13;
of Siauliai is currently employed in the industrial sector. Average wages in state enterprises in Siauliai&#13;
range from 314 LT/month in retail sales to 552 LT/month in the construction industry. Pensioners receive&#13;
a monthly pension of approximately 120 Litas from the state. The registered unemployed receive between&#13;
75 and 120 Litas a month for a period of 6 months after registration. In addition, a significant grey&#13;
economy provides many with their primary income or supplementary income.&#13;
1.34          Siauliai Water (SWJ. Siauliai Water, a municipally owned joint stock company, provides&#13;
water and wastewater services to approximately 85% of the population of Siauliai, or approximately&#13;
125,000 people. Fifteen percent of the population, mostly in peri-urban areas, draw water from their own&#13;
shallow wells and use cesspits and septic tanks for disposal of wastewater. In addition, the utility provides&#13;
approximately 80% of the industry's water needs, the remaining industrial needs being satisfied by private&#13;
wells. SW currently receives all industrial wastewater from the city in its collection network.&#13;
1.35          The organization structure of SW is similar to utilities in the neighboring countries. It is&#13;
characterized by self-sufficiency in the provision of services and a high number of people in both core and&#13;
support services. The water and sewerage networks and process technologies are to a large extent outdated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
and require therefore much repair and servicing. Nevertheless, the quality of housekeeping of SW is high&#13;
throughout the organization, which reflects good work discipline and competent management. SW&#13;
currently employs more than 560 individuals, corresponding to about five employees per 1,000 served&#13;
customers. This is about 4-5 times more than in Western Europe on average.&#13;
1.36         The transformation of SW from a state enterprise to a municipal joint stock company has&#13;
required much attention from the City Council, municipal administration and the utility itself. The&#13;
objective to safeguard public interest has created a governance process with an excessive number of layers&#13;
of political and administrative representatives. In working with MoEP, the Bank, donor agencies, and&#13;
consultants, SW has demonstrated a willingness to examine new approaches to management, to develop&#13;
a balanced investment program and to place an increased priority on operation and maintenance issues.&#13;
SW has drafted a detailed Action Plan (Annex 2), which includes a new governance plan, draft enterprise&#13;
strategy, tariff setting process and organizational restructuring plan. As a condition for negotiations, the&#13;
City Council transferred the tariff setting authority to the Executive Committee of the MS.&#13;
1.37          Water Supply and Levels of Service. Water supplied in Siauliai is generally available&#13;
without interruption. Drinking water is drawn from groundwater aquifers, and contains high levels of iron&#13;
and calcium, making it both discolored and excessively hard. Both the iron and calcium levels exceed&#13;
Lithuanian standards and EU directives. Statistics collected by health care centers across Lithuania appear&#13;
to show the incidence of kidney and liver ailments in Siauliai to be 10-15% higher than elsewhere in the&#13;
country. It is widely believed by medical authorities and municipal officials in Siauliai that this higher&#13;
incidence is the direct consequence of the iron and calcium content of the water consumed in Siauliai.&#13;
Water extraction has decreased by about 30% from 60,000 m3 to approximately 40,000 m3 over the last&#13;
2-3 years due to a decrease in water consumption by the industrial sector.&#13;
1.38         Leakage at the water supply station and from the network was estimated to be 7,000 m3/day&#13;
or 18% of total water extraction and is anticipated to increase. Such leakage from the system is to be&#13;
expected, given the age of the system. The oldest pipes are more than 40 years old, well above the&#13;
estimated lifetime of steel pipes (estimated 20 years) and cast iron pipes (estimated 40 years). The&#13;
condition of the pipes is worsened by the nature of the pumps (an "on/off" type) causing severe water&#13;
hammering. The reliability and energy efficiency of the equipment in the pumping stations are poor and&#13;
the supply of spare parts from former FSU sources unreliable. Accordingly, maintenance and energy costs&#13;
are high.&#13;
1.39         Sanitation Facilities and Levels of Service. Industrial plants within the boundaries of the&#13;
MS (approximately 56 plants, of which 35 are of a significant size) discharge their effluents into the&#13;
municipal sewerage system. The existing wastewater treatment plant, located immediately adjacent to a&#13;
residential area, is in poor condition and has a short remaining physical life.&#13;
1.40         The sewerage system is suffering from lack of rehabilitation, and infiltration of surface and&#13;
groundwaters into the system is substantial. In addition, leaks from the sewerage system are a potential&#13;
threat to the groundwater. The sewerage system discharges to a treatment plant, originally built in 1967,&#13;
and from there to the outfall into the Kulpe River. The existing treatment plant's capacity is below the&#13;
current flows, resulting in deficient treatment at the plant and routine bypassing of the wastewater flows&#13;
directly into the Kulpe River. Flow of the wastewater treatment plant is at present approximately 40-&#13;
45,000 m3/day with a BOD load of 15 t/d. It is estimated that the plant can biologically treat between 35-&#13;
40,000 m3/day. The average daily production of wastewater in 1994 was estimated to be 46,000 m3/day&#13;
(25,500 m3 from the residential sector, 7,700 ni from the industrial sector, and 12,800 dh from water&#13;
infiltration caused mainly by the poor condition of the wastewater pipes network). Peak flows, before the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
decline in industrial activities, influenced by storm water, have exceeded 100,000 m3/day. The current&#13;
average BOD concentration of the treated effluent discharged in the river, even following the reduction in&#13;
industrial flows due to economic recession, is estimated to be 80-100 mg/l compared with the "HELCOM&#13;
Recommendation" of 15 mg/I.&#13;
1.41          Toward the end of the Soviet period, the construction of a new wastewater plant outside&#13;
the city was started in Siauliai. The new plant was scalcd according to Soviet norms for domestic and&#13;
industrial water use and wastewater generation. About half of the civil works for this plant are currently&#13;
complete. The new facility, however, vastly exceeds in capacity any expected flow from Siauliai, even&#13;
under the most optimistic assumptions of industrial growth. A revised design has been prepared by a joint&#13;
team of Lithuanian and Swedish specialists. The revised design takes advantage of the fixed investments&#13;
in civil works and has adjusted the design parameters to those consistent with western design norms.&#13;
1.42          SW's sludge handling capacity is inadequate.  The wastewater treatment plant was&#13;
originally designed with a digester, and later with a centrifuge. However, neither of these has ever been&#13;
in operation. All the sludge is pumped into lagoons. The first set of these lagoons, covering 13.5 ha, was&#13;
closed in the late 1970's. A second set of lagoons, located at the site of the new wastewater treatment&#13;
plant, covering approximately 100 ha, is expected to be filled by 1996. This area includes several ponds&#13;
for tannery and slaughterhouse wastes. SW estimates that 12 new hectares of lagoon are needed each year.&#13;
The sludge is not differentiated according to toxicity. It is believed that the clay soil beneath the lagoons&#13;
prevents contamination of the groundwater; however, no groundwater monitoring exists to validate these&#13;
claims.&#13;
1.43          Monitoring.  There are currently approximately 4,600 water consumption meters&#13;
(industry, 360; residential, 300; and commercial, 3,940) in operation in Siauliai. There is usually only a&#13;
single meter per multi-unit dwelling, discouraging households from undertaking measures to reduce their&#13;
water consumption.&#13;
1.44          In order to establish the pollution charges SW and private industrial users have to pay&#13;
MoEP, the pollution content of their effluent must by analyzed on a weekly basis. The REPO monitors&#13;
and analyzes the effluent of the treatment plant on a monthly basis and pollution charges are paid by the&#13;
treatment plant on a quarterly basis. Plants discharging into the municipal sewerage network have to&#13;
analyze the pollution content of their effluent regularly (quarterly for larger plants) and submit to the utility&#13;
their total discharges of pollutants once a year. Sampling of the plants' effluents by the utility is performed&#13;
irregularly but tends to be more frequent for larger plants. Compliance with the conditions of the permits&#13;
appears to be universal, but this is mainly due to the decline in industrial activity. Though Siauliai&#13;
regulates the discharges of heavy metals by industrial sources, it is common knowledge that the incentives&#13;
are not large enough to induce any abatement of those emissions. The reported presence of heavy metals&#13;
in the plants' effluents undermines the efficiency of the biological treatment of the wastewater and makes&#13;
the sludge, after dewatering, unsuitable for use in agriculture or forestry.&#13;
1.45          The REPO of Siauliai monitors water quality at five different stations in the Siauliai region.&#13;
Once a month, samples are taken from each of these stations, and the BOD, nitrogen, phosphorous,&#13;
ammonia, and nitrate content are determined. These analyses are performed in the laboratory of the&#13;
regional office. Four times a year, samples are analyzed by the central laboratory of the MoEP in Vilnius&#13;
for their heavy metals content, including copper, nickel, zinc, chromium, cadmium and lead. However,&#13;
laboratory equipment is generally obsolete, and the data itself are not sufficiently reliable to identify the&#13;
pollution load at specific point sources.&#13;

D. Bank Environment Strategy in Lithuania, Past Experience and Rationale&#13;
1.46         Environment is one of the focal areas of the Bank's country assistance strategy for&#13;
Lithuania; hence, priority investments in the sector, together with the project's intended support to the&#13;
decentralization process in the country, ranks highly in the Bank's program. The Bank's approach to&#13;
environmental concerns is to support: (a) preventive measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts,&#13;
through the use of policy and regulatory measures, environmental assessments, environmental planning&#13;
methods and economic instruments; and (b) curative measures to address existing problems of air, water&#13;
and soil pollution in a cost effective manner. The investment components should focus on the rehabilitation&#13;
of critical infrastructure and support well justified and phased expansion of facilities at priority locations,&#13;
complemented by support for institutional strengthening activities. Also, the Bank looks for a high&#13;
demonstration and replication value at the national and regional level. The Bank also seeks to develop&#13;
projects where resources can be effectively mobilized from other international financial institutions,&#13;
bilateral donors and non-governmental sources and which support local institutional capacity thus&#13;
promoting self-sufficiency for the future.&#13;
1.47         In the water and wastewater area, the Bank's strategy for Central and Eastern Europe has&#13;
been integrated into the Bank's environmental program and presented by the Bank in a number of forums,&#13;
including the Workshop on Water and Wastewater Utilities held in Riga (1993) and the Resource&#13;
Mobilization Conference for the Baltic Sea Environment Program held in Gdansk (1993). The key&#13;
elements of the strategy are:&#13;
(a)    establishing strong water supply and wastewater utilities to support sustainable investments&#13;
in municipal water and wastewater treatment through the development of autonomous self-&#13;
financing municipal/regional public or private water and wastewater utilities;&#13;
(b)    supporting least cost planning and investment selections for municipal/industrial water&#13;
supply and wastewater systems, which are properly sized and designed;&#13;
(c)    promoting water demand management to maximize investment resources and reduce&#13;
operating costs;&#13;
(d)    supporting actions for rehabilitation of existing systems, improvements in operational&#13;
efficiency, phasing and utilization of cost-effective technologies to reduce investment and&#13;
operating costs significantly; and&#13;
(e)    promoting the careful analysis of the impact of industries and taking into consideration&#13;
actions to reduce industrial water consumption and wastewater discharges.&#13;
1.48         Bank experience in the implementation of environmental management projects in Central&#13;
and Eastern Europe, to date, centers on the lessons learned from the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays&#13;
Environment Project in Estonia, the Environment Management Project in Poland, the Liepaja Environment&#13;
Project in Latvia, and the Klaipeda Environment Project in Lithuania, currently under implementation.&#13;
These projects demonstrate the importance of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(a)    establishing locally staffed project implementation units which have personnel well trained&#13;
in project supervision, financial management and competitive procurement procedures,&#13;
further supported with proper independent auditing; and&#13;
(b)    careful monitoring of the availability of local counterpart funds.&#13;
These projects also demonstrate the high potential of a well designed and managed project to attract donor&#13;
support for priority activities.&#13;
1.49         Bank experience worldwide in the water and wastewater sector is extensive. Important&#13;
lessons learned include:&#13;
(a)   justifying investments in municipal wastewater treatment plants within the context of a&#13;
basin-wide, least-cost strategy for improving ambient water quality, in accordance with a&#13;
phased plan for water quality improvements;&#13;
(b)    making investment decisions that are guided by a medium-term, prioritized least-cost&#13;
investment plan covering all of a utility's needs. The definition of this investment program&#13;
requires the preparation of comprehensive master plans and feasibility studies; and&#13;
(c)    validating investment decisions by careful financial plans (including financial projections),&#13;
complemented by institutional strengthening action plans, to ensure that the proposed&#13;
investment program is financially viable and that the utility is prepared to assume the&#13;
responsibility for effective management of systems and facilities.&#13;
These lessons have been considered in the design of the proposed project.&#13;
1.50         The proposed Project would promote regional environmental cooperation and&#13;
environmentally sustainable management and development of the Upper Lielupe River Basin. It would also&#13;
provide an opportunity to assist the Lithuanian Government in its efforts to improve its capacity to&#13;
coordinate and manage environmental projects, to improve national environmental quality, protect the&#13;
Baltic Sea and demonstrate environmental management techniques. The implementation of the proposed&#13;
Project is of particular importance because of the limited absorptive capacity of the Lielupe River Basin&#13;
which extends into Latvia and drains into the Gulf of Riga at Jurmala. In the absence of Bank involvement,&#13;
it is unlikely that the country would be able to mobilize the technical assistance and financial resources&#13;
required to implement the proposed Project in such an integrated manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Formulation&#13;
2.1          In 1974, the countries of the Baltic Sea region signed the "Convention on the Protection&#13;
of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area" in Helsinki ("HELCOM"). In April 1992, the&#13;
Ministers of Environment of the Baltic Sea region adopted a Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action&#13;
Plan (JCP) which identified a series of priority actions concerning policies and legislation, actions for the&#13;
control of point and non-point source pollution, measures for the management of coastal lagoons and&#13;
wetlands as well as institutional strengthening and human resources development to be undertaken as&#13;
elements of a long-term regional environmental program.&#13;
2.2          In Lithuania and Latvia, there has been considerable concern both about the adverse&#13;
environmental effects of point and non-point source pollution discharged directly to the Lielupe River and&#13;
its tributaries. More than half of the total pollutant load of the Lielupe River originates from the City of&#13;
Siauliai in Lithuania while on the Latvian side, pollution sources are relatively small and geographically&#13;
dispersed. The Latvian Government (GoLA) has raised its concerns about the transboundary pollution&#13;
originating from the Lithuanian side on a number of occasions. The GoLI has acknowledged the problem,&#13;
and when Siauliai was pointed out in the JCP as a "priority Hot Spot" it was concurrently ranked by&#13;
Lithuanian authorities as a high priority for national and foreign investment in environmental protection&#13;
and included in the Public Investment Program and approved by the Lithuanian Parliamentary Committee&#13;
on Environment and the Cabinet of Ministers.&#13;
2.3          MoEP and MS obtained funding for preparation of the feasibility study4 for water and&#13;
wastewater improvements in Siauliai from the Govermnent of Sweden. Concurrently, personnel from&#13;
MoEP, concerned REPOs, the Siauliai Environment Department, and the Swedish Environmental Research&#13;
Institute, reviewed potential environmental management activities for the Upper Lielupe River Basin.&#13;
Preparation of the proposed Project included an identification mission in January 1995, a pre-appraisal&#13;
mission in March/April 1995 and an appraisal mission in June 1995. These visits have also included the&#13;
participation of representatives of Sida, the Finnish Ministry of Environment, and the Norwegian Pollution&#13;
Authority.&#13;
2.4          The proposed Project would be the second Bank-supported investment project for&#13;
improvement of environmental quality undertaken by the GoLI. It was developed by MoEP with the&#13;
assistance of the Bank as an integrated environmental management project, with emphasis on reduction of&#13;
both domestic and transboundary impacts of water pollution It supports the GoLI's objectives to promote&#13;
the decentralization of responsibility for environmental services to municipal governments and to&#13;
restructure and modernize the water and wastewater sector. The proposed Project is also intended by&#13;
MoEP to serve as a "model project" to demonstrate actions for management of point source pollution from&#13;
restructured livestock enterprises and control of non-point source pollution from agriculture. In addition,&#13;
the strategy of the MoEP is to have the proposed Project provide a technical and management framework&#13;
for an effective application of funds from diverse sources to maximize environmental benefits. These&#13;
benefits would be reduced if funds were used at a variety of separate locations.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.5          Project Objectives.  The overall purpose of the Project is to promote regional&#13;
environmental cooperation, address pollution sources in the Upper Lielupe River Basin and promote its&#13;
environmentally sustainable management and development. The following project objectives would be&#13;
monitored according to project monitoring indicators determined during appraisal (Annex 1):&#13;
*     reduction of various pollutant loads from the Siauliai area into the Upper Lielupe River&#13;
Basin, thus decreasing the transboundary pollution into the river and the Gulf of Riga;&#13;
*     improvement of the quality, reliability and cost efficiency of water supply and wastewater&#13;
services in Siauliai;&#13;
*     assist in establishing financially sustainable provision of municipal services; and&#13;
*     improvement of the regional and local environmental quality monitoring and enforcement&#13;
system in the Upper Lielupe River Basin.&#13;
2.6           Complementary institutional strengthening and monitoring activities would be supported&#13;
by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) in Latvia. These activities would&#13;
share a common design and consultants would be chosen in collaboration with the Bank.&#13;
C. Participation by Other Organizations in Project Activities&#13;
2.7          The GoLI would provide US $7.60 million equivalent and MS US $0.45 million equivalent&#13;
in grants for financing Project activities. The limited municipal financing is caused by scarce funding&#13;
capacity and the fact that the proposed Project is a regional environment project, requiring national level&#13;
participation, rather than a municipal water and wastewater project. The proposed municipal contribution&#13;
per year constitutes about 5 % of the MS annual budget. Grant funds provided by donors are being made&#13;
available to MoEP specifically to support an integrated environmental project which has been designed and&#13;
would be supervised with the active support of the Bank. Most of the bilateral funds are provided in the&#13;
context of national support for the Baltic Sea Environment Programme and cannot be transferred into other&#13;
projects. Project preparation was coordinated by the MoEP, with the support of the Bank. Representatives&#13;
of the Governments of Finland, Sweden, and Norway, participated actively in the project preparation. The&#13;
Bank is assisting in the preparation of terms of reference for the EMC, to be used by participating donors.&#13;
The following organizations have expressed their intent to support the implementation of the proposed&#13;
Project:&#13;
(a)    Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. The Government of Sweden,&#13;
through Sida, intends to provide a grant of SEK 29 million (about US $4.0 million&#13;
equivalent) to support investments for wastewater treatment improvements in Siauliai and&#13;
about US $300,000 to support EMC activities for reduction of non-point source pollution.&#13;
In addition, the Swedish Government is already funding activities to support the "Lielupe&#13;
River Basin Commission"for about SEK 2.6 million (about US $350,000). Sida is also&#13;
reviewing possible additional support for a twinning arrangement with a Swedish river&#13;
basin management organization;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(b)    Ministry of Environment of Finland. The Government of Finland, through its Ministry of&#13;
Environment, intends to provide a grant of FIM 7.30 million (about US $1.7 million&#13;
equivalent) to support investments for wastewater treatment improvements in Siauliai (US&#13;
$1.5 million) and the preparation and implementation of the Industrial Pollution&#13;
Management Plan (US $200,000). The Ministry of Agriculture has indicated its interest&#13;
in supporting the EMC activities (about US $400,000) for pollution control in pig farms;&#13;
(c)    Norwegian Pollution Authority. The Government of Norway, through its Pollution&#13;
Authority, has indicated that it would provide a grant of about US $1.5 million&#13;
equivalent to support sewer network rehabilitation and institutional strengthening of SW&#13;
in the form of a twinning arrangement with a water and wastewater utility; and&#13;
(d)    Other Potential Donors. The GoLI and the Bank are currently consulting with EU(Phare),&#13;
the Governments of Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other selected bilateral&#13;
donors concerning possible additional funding for both components of the proposed&#13;
Project.&#13;
D. Project Components and Description&#13;
2.8          Project Description. A Project Implementation Plan (PIP), based on an outline provided&#13;
by the Bank, is under preparation by the Borrower. The PIP would provide details of the project and its&#13;
implementation. The preparation of the PIP by the Borrower would promote greater sense of ownership&#13;
of the project and assure their active involvement in the implementation of the Project. A draft PIP was&#13;
discussed during negotiations. The final PIP will include an Action Plan (Annex 2) for the SW and an&#13;
Implementation Program for the EMC. The Action Plan states the SW's operational, organizational, and&#13;
fuiancial goals in the short- and medium-term and include proposed additional steps for achieving Project&#13;
objectives and enabling efficient implementation of the WWIC. This includes changes in governance, tariff&#13;
setting practices, operational restructuring, and incentives for enterprise efficiency.&#13;
2.9          The finalization and submission of an acceptable implementation program, for the EMC&#13;
by MoEP to the Bank was a condition of Board Presentation (para 6.5). During negotiations, it was&#13;
agreed that the Project would be carried out in accordance with the SW Action Plan and the EMC&#13;
Implementation Program, as agreed with the Bank (para. 6.4a).&#13;
2.10         The proposed Project, consists of two complementary components, which would be&#13;
implemented over four years. A overview of the proposed project is presented as Annex 3. The project&#13;
would comprise:&#13;
(a)    Water and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC - US $21.0 million). This would&#13;
include support for rehabilitation, upgrading, and expansion of the water and wastewater&#13;
system, including equipment and works, and engineering services. An important element&#13;
for institutional strengthening would be the contractual twinning arrangement with a water&#13;
and wastewater utility. A condition for effectiveness of the proposed Loan is that an&#13;
agreement for a twinning arrangement between SW and a foreign water and wastewater&#13;
utility acceptable to the Bank, has been executed on behalf of SW and such utility, under&#13;
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (para 6.6a) (Annex 4A). Key activities of&#13;
the WWIC would be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(i)    Water Supply and Distribution:&#13;
*      construction of an iron removal plant at the existing Birute&#13;
groundwater well field;&#13;
*      renewal of pumps requiring high maintenance and supply of&#13;
critical spare parts; and&#13;
*      carry out a leak detection and control program.&#13;
(ii)    Wastewater Collection and Treatment:&#13;
*      rehabilitation of the sewerage system to reduce infiltration and&#13;
leakage;&#13;
*      rehabilitation of pumping stations requiring high maintenance&#13;
including provision of energy efficient equipment;&#13;
*      rehabilitation of the existing Siauliai wastewater treatment plant&#13;
to allow operations during the construction of the new wastewater&#13;
treatment plant in Siauliai; and&#13;
*      completion of the new wastewater treatment plant, including main&#13;
pumping station, screens, grit removal, primary sedimentation,&#13;
aeration, phosphorus removal, final sedimentation, and sludge&#13;
dewatering.&#13;
(iii)   Technical Assistance and Training for:&#13;
*      preparation of a detailed tariff study for SW;&#13;
*      support for PIU (engineering design, project coordination and&#13;
construction supervision); and&#13;
*      institutional restructuring and strengthening  (including the&#13;
twinning arrangement) and training for SW.&#13;
All sub components, except Birute iron removal plant and the new wastewater&#13;
treatment plant consist of rehabilitation of existing networks or replacement of&#13;
pumps. The least cost options would be determined during the detailed design and&#13;
subsequent bidding process. Alternatives concern selection of materials (e.g.&#13;
ductile iron versus plastic), construction methods (e.g. no dig or open trench&#13;
technology) or equipment.&#13;
The proposed Birute iron removal plant would be the same design as the existing&#13;
plant at Dzidai. It is of conventional design, having a minimum level of&#13;
sophisticated equipment but still allowing automatic operation with relatively few&#13;
operators required at site. The technology is considered appropriate for the&#13;
proposed Project because it fits the specific soil conditions, and does not require&#13;
additional land areas which would be a constraint. In addition, the operators are&#13;
well acquainted with the current technology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Two alternative sites were considered for the new wastewater treatment plant: the&#13;
existing site, and the site for the partially constructed new plant. The existing site&#13;
is very close to residential areas (less than 200 meters) and existing land use would&#13;
make the storage of sludge from a reasonable distance from the plan impossible.&#13;
In addition, considerable investmnents have already been made at the new site. The&#13;
cost estimate of the new wastewater treatment plant and related sub components&#13;
e.g. main pumping station are based on maximal utilization of already built&#13;
structures. Detailed design phase will involve comparison of different alternatives&#13;
e.g. for water and sludge processes which is a normal practice in wastewater&#13;
treatment plant projects.&#13;
(b)    Environmental Management Component (EMC - US $1.85 million). The activities to be&#13;
supported under the EMC include:&#13;
Activity No. 1. Direct Support for the Lithuanian side of the "Lielupe&#13;
River Basin Commission (US $300, 000): "&#13;

Activity No. 3. Small Point Source Pollution Control (US $400, 000):&#13;
*     Implementation on a "demonstration basis" of cost-effective&#13;
management and control actions to reduce pollution at pig farms&#13;
in the Upper Lielupe River Basin; and&#13;
*     Training seminars and technical assistance for representatives of&#13;
the pig farms in the Project area and other livestock producers.&#13;
Activity No. 4. Non-Point Source Pollution Control (US $300,000):&#13;
Implementation of an agricultural run-off demonstration activities;&#13;
*     -Establishment of measurement facilities to assess nutrient runoff;&#13;
*     Annual on-farm inventories to assess responses to changes in&#13;

*      Demonstration activities for the more efficient use of manure,&#13;
fertilizers and pesticides;&#13;
*     Measures to limit animal density;&#13;
*      Actions to increase nutrient trapping and improve biological&#13;
diversity;&#13;
*      An active extension and information program with an emphasis on&#13;
direct farmer participation; and&#13;
*     Complementary activities to improve the management of&#13;
household wastes and other measures to protect drinking water.&#13;
2.11         It is anticipated that Project supported institutional strengthening activities in Lithuania&#13;
under the EMC would have complementary activities for institutional strengthening in Latvia supported&#13;
by bilateral sources. Discussions concerning funding for these complementary activities in Latvia have&#13;
been initiated with the Government of Sweden.&#13;

E. Cost Estimates&#13;
2.12            The total cost of the Project is estimated to be US $22.85 million (about LT 91.40 million&#13;
equivalent) including contingencies. SW does not have any net Value Added Tax (VAT) payments, all paid&#13;
VAT is reimbursed to SW and is therefore not included in Project costs. As an environmental project, the&#13;
proposed Project qualifies for exemption from local taxes. Price contingencies are based on a prediction&#13;
for international inflation of 2.5%  - 1995-98 and 3% for 1999. Local inflation in Litas is predicted at 26%&#13;
- 1996, 22% - 1997, 18% - 1998, 14% - 1999. The estimated cost distributed among components is shown&#13;
in Table 2.1 and in greater detail in Annex 5, Tables la and lb.&#13;

2.13            The WWIC cost is estimated at about US $21.00 million or LT 84.00 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies. The total WWIC base cost is estimated at US $15.20 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies are estimated at US $1.40 million. Price contingencies would amount to approximately&#13;
US $4.40 million or 27% of base cost, plus physical contingencies. Total contingencies represent 38% of&#13;
the base cost. Conservative contingency factors have been used given the limited experience with&#13;
construction cost estimates and prices in Lithuania. The foreign exchange component is estimated at about&#13;
US $10.50 million including contingencies, or about 50% of the total cost of the WWIC.&#13;
2.14            The EMC cost is estimated at about US $1.68 million or LT 7.40 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies. The total base cost is estimated at US $1.40 million. Physical contingencies are&#13;
estimated at US $0.10 million. Price contingencies would amount to approximately US $0.40 million or&#13;
27 % of base cost plus physical contingencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
F. Project Financing Arrangements&#13;
2.15         Single Currency Loan. GoLI is eligible for single currency loans (SCL) under the&#13;
expanded SCL program for 100% of its anticipated FY96 lending program of US $42.1 million equivalent.&#13;
The Borrower informed the Bank during negotiations that it wishes to borrow in single currency (US&#13;
dollar) at a fixed interest rate for the proposed Project. The Lithuania delegation justified the choice of&#13;
a single currency loan by: (a) the composition and structure of Lithuania's foreign exchange reserve; (b)&#13;
that Lithuania's currency is pegged to the US dollar; and (c) that more than 60% of Lithuania's foreign&#13;
transactions are based on the US dollar. In addition, the Lithuania delegation pointed out that SW would&#13;
benefit from a fixed interest rate as it would enable more accurate calculations of interest obligations which&#13;
is desirable as these calculations impact SW's consumers through water and wastewater tariffs.&#13;
2.16         The proposed Bank Loan of US $6.20 million would finance about 27% of total Project&#13;
costs including contingencies. The proposed Bank Loan would finance about 33 % of the foreign costs and&#13;
26% of the local costs. The Bank Loan would be a fixed rate US dollar single currency loan with standard&#13;
amortization terms, grace period and interest rate for such loans that are expected to disburse within 3-6&#13;
years. As no other financing is available, an advance of US $250,000 (or about 4%) has been requested&#13;
from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) and would be used to support the immediate establishment of&#13;
the PIU, preparation of bidding documents and to conduct a tariff study for SW.&#13;
2.17         WW7C. A portion of the proposed Bank Loan (US $6.0 million) would finance about 29%&#13;
of the WWIC including contingencies. Parallel grant cofinancing by the Governments of Finland&#13;
(US $1.50 equivalent), Norway (US $1.50 million equivalent), and Sweden (US $4.00 million equivalent)&#13;
would comprise about 33 % of total component costs. Local counterpart contribution of LT 30.40 million&#13;
or US $7.60 million equivalent would be provided by the GoLI and LT 1.60 million or US $400,000&#13;
equivalent would be provided by the MS and comprises about 38% of the total component costs.&#13;
2.18         EMC. A portion of the proposed Bank Loan (US $200,000) would finance about 11 % of&#13;
the EMC including contingencies. Grant financing would comprise US $1.65 million or 89% of the costs.&#13;
Parallel grant cofinancing by the Government of Sweden (about US $ 650,000) has been preliminary&#13;
confirmed and additional support for a twinning arrangement with a Swedish river basin management&#13;
organization is under review. The Finnish Ministry of Environment would provide US $200,000&#13;
equivalent for the preparation and implementation of an Industrial Pollution Management Plan and the&#13;
Finnish Ministry of Agriculture would provide US $400,000 for activities in the pig farms. Participation&#13;
of EU(Phare), Governments of Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other donors for an amount&#13;
of at least US $0.40 million equivalent is under discussion.&#13;
2.19         A condition for loan effectiveness was that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of&#13;
the Finnish Grant Agreement, the Swedish Grant Agreement and the Norwegian Grant Agreement have&#13;
been fulfilled (para 6.6b). During negotiations it was agreed that if proposed grantfinancing for the EMC&#13;
would not be confirmed by June 30, 1997, the GoLI would find alternativefinancing (para. 6. Ia).&#13;
2.20         The Project has been collaboratively designed with the direct participation of&#13;
representatives of the Governments of Finland, Norway and Sweden. Extensive discussions have been held&#13;
concerning the respective responsibilities of the cofinancers in implementation and supervision of the&#13;
Project. Proceeds from the proposed Bank loan would be utilized to finance water supply and wastewater&#13;
components and selected subcomponents of the EMC. Proceedings from the Finnish, Norwegian and&#13;
Swedish grants, would finance rehabilitation subcomponents for the old wastewater plant, activities at the&#13;
new wastewater treatment plan, and the twinning arrangement. A detailed breakdown of the financing of&#13;
subcomponents by financier is provided in Table lb in Annex 5.&#13;
&#13;

2.21          The sumnmarized financing plan presented in Table 2.2 includes the proceeds of the Bank&#13;
Ioan, local contribution and cofinancing. More detailed financing plans can be found in Tables 2 and 3&#13;

2.22          Onlending Arrangements.  The GoLI views the proposed Project as a priority&#13;
environmental investment, and is therefore willing to guarantee the Bank Loan and to provide direct grant&#13;
assistance to the municipal government for implementation of the Project. For the EMC, the GoLI's MoF&#13;
would pass on the funds received from the Bank (US $200,000) to the MoEP (Siauliai and Panevezys&#13;
Regional Environmental Protection Office).&#13;
2.23          For the WWIC, the GoLI would provide the funds received from the Bank (US $6.0&#13;
million) directly to SW in US dollars at the same fixed interest rate as provided to the Borrower by the&#13;
Bank. SW would repay the subsidiary loan in 10 years, with a grace period of 4 years. The onlending&#13;
would be The SW together with the MS would enter into a project agreement with the Bank. A condition&#13;
of effectiveness of the Bank Loan is that a subsidiary is executed by GoLI and SW (para 6.6c).&#13;
2.24          The lack of a mark-up for onlending should be viewed as a means of GoLI supporting&#13;
major deferred investments in rehabilitation of deteriorated infrastructure and critical major capital&#13;
investments in modern water and wastewater treatment facilities, allowing these companies to become&#13;
capable of developing into effective self-financing organizations. In its current state, SW is not yet able&#13;
to raise money for its investments on the commercial market5, thus no displacement of market borrowing&#13;
is occurring. In the longer term (by year 2001), once the utility becomes fully operational and financially&#13;
autonomous, it would be able to raise its own funds for additional system expansions and treatment plant&#13;
upgrades.&#13;
5      Current commercial market rates for long-term lending are greatly distorted in Lithuania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
2.25         During negotiations, it was agreed that all goods, works and services to be financed from&#13;
the loan proceeds would be procured in accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines for Procurement '&#13;
(January, 1995) including amendments as of the loan signing date, using the Bank standard bidding&#13;
documents. Consulting Services would be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for "Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as an Executing Agency" (August 1981),&#13;
including amendments as of the loan signing date (para 6.4b).&#13;
2.26         The laws and regulations governing public procurement procedures and the commercial&#13;
practices in Lithuania have been reviewed by the Bank. The review found that competitive practices are&#13;
increasingly being used in Lithuania both in the public and private sectors. The Bank is assisting the&#13;
Government in developing the legal and institutional framework for public procurement.&#13;
2.27         A "General Procurement Notice" containing information about bidding opportunities (for&#13;
procurement on the basis of International Competitive Bidding) has been submitted for publication in the&#13;
"Development Business" in accordance with paras. 2.7 and 2.8 of the Bank Guidelines for Procurement,&#13;
January 1995.&#13;
2.28         Cofinancing would be parallel, thus procurement for non-Bank financed sub-components&#13;
would be carried out in accordance with procurement regulations of the respective financier. The PIU&#13;
would carry out the Bank financed procurement for both the WWIC and the EMC. The division between&#13;
goods and works would be determined in the detailed design of the Project sub-components. Detailed&#13;
design would be carried out as a first task by the PIU. Procurement for Bank financed activities would be&#13;
undertaken in the following manner:&#13;
(a)   Internatiorsal Competitive Bidding (ICB). All Bank-funded contracts for goods which are&#13;
estimated to cost more than US $260,000 equivalent per contract would be procured&#13;
following ICB The Borrower would use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. One&#13;
supply and erect contract would be awarded for civil works and supply of necessary goods&#13;
and equipment for the Birute water treatment plant (about US $5.3 million). One contract&#13;
would be awarded for pipes for the raising main in the new wastewater treatment plant&#13;
(about US $1.50 million).&#13;
(b)    National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Procedures for NCB would be used for contracts for&#13;
works under US $120,000. ICB should be used for contracts above that amount. It is&#13;
anticipated that only one contract for works (about US $120,000) would be awarded under&#13;
NCB.&#13;
(c)   International Shopping and National Shopping (IS and NS). Procedures for IS and&#13;
NS would be used for procurement of smaller contracts up to US $260,000 and&#13;
US $50,000 respectively for the WWIC because the cost of ICB would outweigh possible&#13;
price advantages. It is expected that components such as water pumps would be procured&#13;
through IS. NS procedures would be used for procurement of office equipment and&#13;
vehicles for the PIU. Contracts awarded under IS procedures for the WWIC (totaling&#13;
approximately US $260,000) would be based on comparing price quotations obtained from&#13;
at least three suppliers from two eligible countries in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
Contracts awarded under NS procedures (totaling approximately US $85,000) would be&#13;
based on comparing price quotations from at least three local suppliers. For the EMC, IS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
would be used for contracts up to US $100,000. Two contracts would be procured for the&#13;
EMC through IS and would include monitoring and laboratory equipment (totaling&#13;
approximately US $150,000);&#13;
(d)     Sole Source Procurement.  Procurement of spare parts for the water supply system&#13;
rehabilitation (about US $100,000) would be through direct contracting as the spare parts&#13;
are anticipated to be available only from very specialized suppliers; and&#13;
(d)     Consultant Services. Consultant support would be procured for the PIU and training and&#13;
technical assistance to the Siauliai Regional Environmental Protection Office (totaling&#13;
approximately US $490,000). Requested consultant services would include support for&#13;
the preparation of bidding documents, evaluation, training, and construction supervision.&#13;
Potential candidates would be short listed and selected on a competitive basis or through&#13;
sole source contracting when appropriate, according to Bank Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants (August 1981) and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. Hiring would&#13;
be on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

2.29         Personnel from SW have participated in a procurement training course, organized by the&#13;
Bank, in May, 1995 in Vilnius. A World Bank Procurement Specialist provided an overview of Bank's&#13;
procurement practices during appraisal. Additional procurement advice would be provided to the&#13;
Borrower, SW and the REPO before loan effectiveness. The efficiency and capability of the Borrower to&#13;
carry out the Bank's procurement procedures would be strengthened through ongoing training, the use of&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents, and provision of international procurement expertise for the PIU, financed&#13;
under the proposed Loan.&#13;
2.30         Procurement Review. As the number of Bank financed contracts is small, and the borrower&#13;
has limited experience with Bank procurement procedures, prior review would apply to all contracts for&#13;
goods, works and consultants.&#13;
2.31         Procurement Monitoring. Procurement data would be collected and recorded by the PIU&#13;
for: (a) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (b) comprehensive quarterly&#13;
reports to the Bank by the Borrower; and (c) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising,&#13;
bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts. A computerized procurement&#13;
management system would be installed by the PIU.&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
2.32         To facilitate Project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in&#13;
a major commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's share of&#13;
eligible expenditures. The authorized allocation would be US $500,000 representing about four months&#13;
of average expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stage of the project, the&#13;
initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US $250,000. When the aggregate&#13;
disbursements under the Loan have reached the level of US $1,000,000, the initial allocation may be&#13;
increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US $500,000 by submitting the relevant application for&#13;
withdrawal. At the request of the Borrower, and based on Project needs, the Bank would make an initial&#13;
deposit or deposits into the Special Account up to the amount of the authorized allocation. Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has&#13;
been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow&#13;
the standard Bank procedure. Monthly bank statements of the special account which have been reconciled&#13;
by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. The terms and conditions of the&#13;
establishment and operation of the Special Account were agreed during negotiations (para 6. Ib).&#13;
2.33         Training in disbursements would be provided to relevant staff of the PIU. The PIU is&#13;
expected to benefit from experience gathered by the Klaipeda Environment Project PIU. Disbursement&#13;
advice is also available from the Bank's Regional Mission in Riga.&#13;
2.34         The proposed Loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of four fiscal years (1997-&#13;
2000) with an estimated closing date in June 2000. Annual estimated disbursements are shown in&#13;
Table 2.4. A financing plan by disbursement category is shown in Annex 5, Table 6. An estimated&#13;
schedule of disbursement is shown in Annex 5, Table 7.&#13;

(a)    For goods: 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local ex-factory expenditures and 80%&#13;
of local expenditures for other items procured locally;&#13;
(b)    For works: 100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures; and&#13;
(c)    For consultancy services and training: 100% of expenditures.&#13;
2.36         Disbursement requests would be prepared and submitted to the Bank directly by the PIU.&#13;
Copies of requests would be sent to the MoF. All cofinancing is parallel, not joint. Thus all confinancers&#13;
would manage their own disbursements.&#13;
2.37         Disbursements would be made against standard Bank documentation. The documentation&#13;
to support these expenditures would be retained by the PIU for review by Bank supervision missions and&#13;
verification by external audits. Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for expenditures&#13;
under contracts for goods and equipment valued at less than US $260,000 equivalent and contracts for&#13;
services valued at less than US $100,000 equivalent for firms and less than US $50,000 equivalent for&#13;
individuals, where statements of expenditure (SOE's) may be used. The minimum size of application for&#13;
payments directly from the Loan Account and issuance of special commitments is 20% of the current&#13;
Special Account authorized allocation.&#13;
I. Accounts and Audits&#13;
2.38         It was agreed during negotiations that the Special Account would be audited in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's "Guidelinesfor Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank"&#13;
(March 1982) (para 6. Ic). It was also agreed that SW would have its records, accounts and financial&#13;
statements for each fiscal year audited by independent auditors in accordance with appropriate auditing&#13;
principles consistently applied, and that such audits and copies of its financial statements would be&#13;
furnished to the Bank, no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year (para 6.2). The audit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
reports would contain separate opinions on: (a) compliance by implementing agencies with all financial&#13;
covenants under the Bank Loan; and (b) the statements of expenditure. It is expected that a local branch&#13;
of a private, international, commercial auditor, in association with a local auditing firm if available, would&#13;
carry out the audits, and this arrangement is considered acceptable. Separate project accounts for the EMC&#13;
would be kept and submitted for audit at the same time as the WWIC accounts.&#13;
2.39          The PIU and the local EMC Project Coordinator, would prepare semi-annual descriptive&#13;
and financial reports on each sub component, objective, and Project activity (beginning from the date of&#13;
Loan Effectiveness). An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be carried out according to Bank&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
2.40         Project performance indicators would be monitored by the implementing agencies in&#13;
accordance with methodology acceptable to the Bank as described in Annex 1.&#13;
J. Environmental Screening&#13;
2.41         Preparation of the proposed Project include environmental studies consistent with the&#13;
requirements of the GoLI and the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental&#13;
Assessment." In accordance with these procedures, an environmental review for the WWIC has been&#13;
prepared by "Scanvironment" consistent with the requirements for a category "B" project (Annex 6).&#13;
Supplemental environmental reviews would be prepared as part of the detailed planning process for&#13;
activities supported under the EMC. Representatives of the Siauliai REPO and the Siauliai Municipal&#13;
Environment Office have participated in the feasibility study process and in the activities of the pre-&#13;
appraisal and appraisal missions. The environmental reviews for the EMC would be subject to evaluation&#13;
by the MoEP, the REPO and Bank environmental specialists. Attached as Annex 7 is the Bank's&#13;
Environmental Data Sheet.&#13;
2.42         The proposed Project would not involve involuntary resettlement and is not anticipated to&#13;
have an impact on known archaeological or historical sites in Siauliai or other Project areas. The old and&#13;
new wastewater treatment plants and sludge disposal facilities are at already established sites.&#13;
K. Water Resources Management Policy&#13;
2.43         Water Resources Management Policy. In recent years several major studies have been&#13;
prepared concerning environmental aspects of water resources management in Lithuania in conjunction&#13;
with the Baltic Sea Environment Program. These include the comprehensive "Pre-Feasibility Study of the&#13;
Lithuanian Coast and Nemunas River Basin" prepared by a joint Lithuanian, Danish and Swedish team,&#13;
complemented by studies in support of the "Lielupe River Project" undertaken by a joint Latvian,&#13;
Lithuanian, and Swedish team. In addition, a detailed national study concerning the management of&#13;
agricultural run-off has been completed by a joint Lithuanian and Swedish team. A comprehensive review&#13;
of water quality monitoring requirements has been prepared by a team of Lithuanian and American&#13;
specialists. The activities proposed under the Project have been identified as priority investment actions&#13;
under both the Baltic Sea Environment Program and the Lithuanian PER. They would have a positive&#13;
impact on water resources management through strengthening institutional capacity and improving water&#13;
quality in the Upper Lielupe River Basin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
2.44        The proposed Project has been prepared in a manner consistent with the recommendations&#13;
under the Water Resources Management Policy of the Bank. It would support the objectives of the Water&#13;
Resources Management Policy by: (a) developing the "International Lielupe River Commission" as a&#13;
management organization; (b) strengthening SW and supporting its development into an administratively&#13;
and financially autonomous utility; (c) promoting full cost recovery for water and wastewater services; (d)&#13;
preparing a plan to control the discharge of industrial wastewaters in Siauliai; and (e) establishing a&#13;
practical water quality monitoring systems at regional and local levels. The responsible implementation&#13;
agencies for the WWIC and EMC (MoEP, Panevezys and Siauliai REPOs, SW, and SMEO) are established&#13;
organizations with legal authority and responsibility for water resources management functions.&#13;
2.45         With regard to non-point source pollution management the MoEP intends to support the&#13;
implementation of the recommendations from the 1993 Lithuanian-Swedish study, in cooperation with the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture. Water quality monitoring efforts would be based on implementation of the&#13;
recommendations of the recently completed Lithuanian-USEPA study.&#13;
L. International Waters Issues&#13;
2.46         A legal notification concerning the proposed Project by MoEP to the Latvian Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Regional Development has been carried out in accordance with the Operational Directive&#13;
7.50, "Projects on International Waterways". The Government of Latvia (GoLA) has expressed its strong&#13;
support for the proposed Project, and its intent to cooperate fully for its successful implementation.&#13;
M. Participatory Approach&#13;
2.47         The proposed Project was prepared with the direct participation of the MoEP, Panevezys&#13;
and Siauliai REPOs, MS, Siauliai City Council, SMEO and municipal health authorities. A series of&#13;
workshops were held at the offices of SW at which interested parties reviewed and discussed the findings&#13;
of the consultants and local experts. A similar process was used during Bank identification, pre-appraisal,&#13;
and appraisal missions in which meetings with up to 40 participants were held to review the scope and&#13;
objectives of the proposed Project. These meetings have been the subject of significant coverage by&#13;
regional and local press, radio and television. In addition, meetings have also been conducted by the Bank,&#13;
at the request of MoEP, with representatives of the Latvian Ministry of Environment and Regional&#13;
Development and the Jelgava Regional Environmnental Protection Committee to review current&#13;
transboundary pollution impacts and to assess benefits from planned pollution control measures to be&#13;
supported under the proposed Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
3.1          Project Coordination. The GoLI's MoEP would provide overall coordination to the&#13;
Project, coordinating actions of funding organizations and local implementing agencies and managing&#13;
interactions with the Bank. The coordination would be carried out by the MoEP's Economics and Foreign&#13;
Relations Department where the MoEP has appointed a Project Coordinator to perform this task.&#13;
3.2          Project Steering Committee. To facilitate implementation of the proposed Project and to&#13;
promote communications between the various parties of the proposed Project, the MoEP would establish&#13;
a Project Steering Committee (PSC). The PSC would provide general guidance and it is anticipated that&#13;
the PSC would include representatives of MoEP and MoF, the Environmental Advisor to the Government,&#13;
the Environmental Advisor to the Nature Protection Committee of the Parliament, staff of the Ministry of&#13;
Urban Affairs and Construction, MS, and SW, and representatives of local government authorities where&#13;
environmental management activities would be undertaken. Draft terms of reference for the PSC were&#13;
discussed during appraisal (Annex 4B).&#13;
3.3           Project Implementation Unit. Implementation of the WWIC would be delegated to SW.&#13;
The director of SW would be responsible for supervision of all Project supported activities concerning&#13;
water and wastewater. The EMC would be coordinated and supervised by the MoEP. Implementation of&#13;
this component would be delegated to the Regional Environmental Protection Office's (REPO) in Siauliai&#13;
and Panevezys, Siauliai Municipal Environment Office, and other local authorities. A local EMC&#13;
coordinator has been nominated by the MoEP. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU), located within SW&#13;
would be established. The PIU would carry out all implementation and supervision of the WWIC. For&#13;
the EMC, the PIU would provide assistance in procurement, disbursement, and project administration.&#13;
The PIU would be assisted, as required, by international consultants to support the preparation of technical&#13;
specifications, bidding documents, tendering, bid evaluation, contract awards, supervision of civil works&#13;
and equipment installation, and follow-up activities. Draft terms of reference for the PIU were discussed&#13;
during appraisal (Annex 4C). Establishment of the PIU within SW with functions and responsibilities&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, with staff that shall include a director, an accountant, an English speaking assistant&#13;
whose qualifications and terms of reference are acceptable to the Bank, and a consultant to the PIU&#13;
providing project management and procurement advice, whose qualifications and terms of reference are&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, would be a condition for Loan effectiveness (para 6.6d).&#13;
3.4          Project implementation is anticipated to begin in May 1996 and would be carried out over&#13;
a four-year period. The estimated disbursement period is two years shorter than the Bank's average for&#13;
similar projects. A number of contracts are anticipated to be ready for bidding by the time of Loan&#13;
effectiveness. Bank experience with implementation of environmental management and small-scale civil&#13;
works projects are limited in Central and Eastern Europe; however, given the small size and limited scope&#13;
of the proposed Project, the current advanced state of completion of major elements of the required civil&#13;
works for the new wastewater treatment plant, and assessment of the implementation capacity in Siauliai,&#13;
a four-year implementation appears reasonable.&#13;
3.5          In the case of the EMC, this time frame is justified by the successful negotiation and&#13;
signing of the joint Latvian and Lithuanian agreement establishing the "International Lielupe River&#13;
Commission," the three years of experience gained by the two countries in cooperative data collection&#13;
under the Swedish supported "Lielupe River Project", and success to date in cooperative agricultural run-&#13;
off management activities undertaken with support from Denmark and Sweden.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
B. Project Implementing Agencies&#13;
3.6          Ministry of Environmental Protection. The MoEP has adopted a decentralized approach&#13;
to environmental management through a network of REPO which provide local level support for the&#13;
implementation of its policies and programs. The regional offices are supported by recently established&#13;
municipal units in a number of selected cities, including Siauliai. An assessment of project implementation&#13;
capacity of the REPOs in Siauliai and Panevezys and the Siauliai Municipal Environment Office was&#13;
carried out during appraisal causing institutional support and strengthening activities to be included in the&#13;
EMC.&#13;
3.7          Siauliai Water. The MoEP has appointed SW to implement the WWIC. This approach is&#13;
fully consistent with the policy of the MoEP to support the decentralization of environmental management&#13;
responsibilities to local authorities. In the past, municipal water and wastewater services in Lithuania have&#13;
been provided through state owned enterprises. Since 1991, the management of these enterprises were&#13;
delegated from the central government to the municipal governments. The ownership of the assets&#13;
remained with the state. In March, 1995, as a part of the GoLI's broad strategy to decentralize municipal&#13;
services, the ownership of all water and wastewater assets were transferred to the managing municipalities&#13;
in accordance with recently passed national legislation, SW was subsequently established in March 1995&#13;
as a 100% municipally-owned, limited joint stock company responsible for providing municipal water and&#13;
wastewater services.&#13;
3.8          Siauliai Water is managed by a Director appointed by MS. In addition, MS appoints the&#13;
members of an internal Management Board of SW consisting of executives of SW and the Chief&#13;
Environmentalist of the MS. The Management Board is chaired by the Director. SW's annual budget and&#13;
tariffs were prepared by the Director, presented for the approval of six different committees of the&#13;
Municipality before submitted for voting in the City Council. Since September 28, 1995, as a condition&#13;
for negotiation of the proposed Loan, the City Council transferred the tariff setting authority to the&#13;
Executive Committee of MS. During negotations, agreement was reached, that except as the Bank shall&#13;
otherwise agree, the responsibility for setting water and wastewater tariffs would be maintained with the&#13;
Executive Committee of the MS, which includes the Mayor, Vice Mayor and six Chairmen of the Standing&#13;
Committees of the Siauliai City Council (para 6.3a). Currently SW lacks a supervisory board or board of&#13;
directors that is independent from the utility and that represent the interests of the public/owner. A&#13;
condition for loan effectiveness is that a Supervisory Board of SW with composition and functions&#13;
acceptable to the Bank has been created, and SW Statutes have been amended in accordance with&#13;
applicable laws of the Borrower and in manner satisfactory to the Bank to reflect the creation of such&#13;
Supervisory Board (para 6. 6e). The Supervisory Board would be responsible at least for approving the SW&#13;
annual budget and for reviewing the tariff proposal for the Executive Committee of the Municipality. The&#13;
Action Plan further defines and clarifies the division of decision making powers between the City Council,&#13;
the Executive Committee of the Municipality, the Supervisory Board and SW.&#13;
C. Project Supervision&#13;
3.9          The proposed Project would be supervised by Bank staff in accordance with a proposed&#13;
supervision plan summarized in Annex 8. Representatives from MoEP and the donors (Sida, Finnish&#13;
Ministry of Environment, and the Norwegian Pollution Authority) have informed the Bank that they would&#13;
participate in joint supervision missions. Supervision of the proposed Project would be particularly intense&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
during the first two years when considerable input would be required for: (a) procurement aspects of the&#13;
WWIC; and (b) preparation and initial implementation of activities under the EMC.&#13;
3.10         A mid-term review would be conducted around April 1998 to evaluate overall Project&#13;
progress including progress towards the SW's Action Plan and to assess the development and&#13;
implementation of an amended tariff structure (see terms of reference, Annex 4D). During the mid-term&#13;
review, adjustments would be made in the implementation schedule, if deemed necessary, to improve SW's&#13;
management capacity, and review the long-term tariff rates based on the findings of the tariff study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF "SIAULIAI WATER"&#13;
A. Past Performance and Present Position&#13;
4.1           Overview. The Municipality of Siauliai expects its water and wastewater utility, SW, to&#13;
develop into a financially sound municipal enterprise, able to provide services to its customers in a cost&#13;
effective manner. At the same time the City Council has to develop its own Corporate Governance&#13;
requirements which balance municipal interests, social interests, oversight of public funds, and also permits&#13;
the management to exercise full professional judgement. In turn, in order to develop into an efficiently run&#13;
utility, SW needs to improve its technology and financial management through undertaking complementary&#13;
investment, cost reduction and institutional strengthening activities.&#13;
4.2           Central to the approach of institutional strengthening in the proposed Project is the&#13;
development of a formal "twinning arrangement" on a contractual basis with an experienced water and&#13;
wastewater utility. In SW there is significant potential for improving operational efficiency at the technical&#13;
and managerial level. The Twinning Arrangement would assist SW to identify and realize potential cost&#13;
savings. SW and MS has also shown interest in exploring alternative ways to provide the services in a&#13;
most cost effective manner. Support for a review of various alternatives is included in the proposed&#13;
Project. To assure full transparency in potential changes in management of the water and wastewater&#13;
services, during negotiations, it was agreed that SW shall not implement any substantial management,&#13;
structural or operative changes without prior approval of the Bank (para 6.3b).&#13;
4.3           Past Performance. SW's financial statements for the years 1992-1994 show that although&#13;
the utility has managed to cover costs, there has been a deterioration in financial performance. Pre-tax&#13;
income as a percentage of revenue, has decreased from 35 % in 1992 to 20% in 1994, and is expected to&#13;
further decline to 5% in 1995. This decline can be explained by: (a) the significantly reduced local&#13;
industrial activities that has caused a drop in the volume of produced water and treated sewage6; (b) tariffs&#13;
that have not been adequately adjusted for inflation; (c) increased charges in depreciation due to inflation&#13;
indexing of the assets; and (d) real input price increases (energy and material). As a result, the working&#13;
ratio7 has increased from 0.63 in 1992 to 0.66 in 1994, and the operating ratio8 has increased from 0.65&#13;
to 0.80 during the same time period.&#13;
4.4           This declining trend in performance is expected to continue through 1995 with the working&#13;
ratio deteriorating further to 0.75 and the operating ratio to 0.91. The primary reason for the continuing&#13;
deterioration in financial performance in 1995, is a continuing reduction in volume of water and waste&#13;
water billed, coupled with a 11 % real decline in water prices and a 9 % decline in waste water prices from&#13;
1994 to 1995. Also, staff costs have increased by 18 % in real terms between 1994 and 1995. A summary&#13;

4.5          During the historic period reviewed, SW's ability to service debt is not relevant&#13;
because GoLI has provided financing for the capital investment program in the form of grants.&#13;
Currently, the enterprise has only small levels of short term bank loans, which will be repaid in 1995.&#13;
B. Tariff Levels and Revenues&#13;
4.6          All customers have the same base rates for their water and waste water services. As of&#13;
June, 1995 the water tariff was adjusted to 0.78 LT/m3 (US $0.20), and the wastewater tariff to 0.69 LT/m 3&#13;
9     SW's historical financial statements should not be utilized to judge past financial performance, or be&#13;
compared with the current financial position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
in 1995 (US $0.17). Industry is charged for their wastewater in accordance to their pollution loads by&#13;
volume. Currently, a Value Added Tax (VAT) of 18% is levied on industry and budget customers'°.&#13;
Effective January 1, 1996 household customers will also pay the VAT. The tariff structure is in a&#13;
volumetric form and does not include any standing charges or incremental charges for higher levels of&#13;
consumption. The tariff structure needs to be reviewed in detail. During negotiations it was agreed that&#13;
SW would carry out a water and wastewater tariff study by October 30, 1996 in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank with assistance of a consultant satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 4D) and&#13;
take all action required to implement the recommendations by June 30, 1997 (para 6.3c). In the&#13;
institutional strengthening component of the proposed project, assistance for tariff planning and financial&#13;
operations would be provided based on the results of the tariff study.&#13;
4.7           SW's tariff policy has been aimed at cost recovery as granted by legislation. Analysis show&#13;
that the current water and sewerage tariffs are inadequate to cover all necessary cash and non-cash&#13;
expenses such as: (a) planned maintenance; (b) a provision for bad and doubtful debts; and (c) depreciation&#13;
reflecting replacement cost accounting. The appraisal estimate of total required tariff increases to cover&#13;
total cash and non-cash costs is approximately 12-15%" in real terms each year for the next three years&#13;
whereafter, full cost recovery would be achieved. During negotiations it was agreed that except as the&#13;
Bank shall otherwise agree, the level of the water and wastewater tariffs be increased by at least 15 % in&#13;
real terms by March 15, 1996, in accordance with methodology acceptable to the Bank (para. 6. 3d).&#13;
C. Billing and Collection&#13;
4.8           Consumers are divided into residential, industrial and budget customers. The system has&#13;
4,700 customers (80% residential, 16% industrial and 4% budget) which are all metered'2, though not all&#13;
meters are functioning.&#13;
4.9            Collection: Collection is currently not a major problem. The 1994 average collection&#13;
period, defined as annual collections over annual billings, is estimated at between 45 - 60 days which is&#13;
normal for a water utility. SW currently utilizes the services of collection agencies. State-owned apartment&#13;
blocks, still under state administration, are responsible for most of the outstanding payments. SW claims&#13;
that this is largely because of the legal difficulty they have in disconnecting the apartment blocks' services&#13;
for non-payment. SW penalizes delinquent accounts at an interest charge of 0.2% per day for outstanding&#13;
bills exceeding 40 days for individual and budget customers, and 10 days for industrial customers.&#13;
Disconnection of water services is effected after a number of warnings. Cooperative apartment blocks are&#13;
fairly current in their payment, reportedly because of both the interest penalty and the risk of&#13;
disconnection.&#13;
10     Schools, hospitals, other municipal establishments and commercial non-industrial establishments.&#13;
11     provided there is no devaluation during this period which would result in large real increases of energy costs.&#13;
12     Block houses have one meter at the 'entrance", thus few individual apartments are metered. Meters for&#13;
industrial and budget subscribers are read by SW personnel on a monthly basis. Individual subscribers are&#13;
responsible for recording their meter information in a coupon book provided to them by SW. This&#13;
information is verified by SW on a quarterly basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
4.10          Records for all subscriber accounts in SW are currently maintained by hand, making it&#13;
difficult to analyze outstanding accounts. The utility is making significant progress towards computerizing&#13;
all aspects of billing and collections. The computerization is progressing slowly due to lack of funds for&#13;
additional software and hardware purchases, and the low levels of computer knowledge among enterprise&#13;
employees and workers. The proposed project would include support for information technology and&#13;
adequate computer skills training.&#13;
D. Accounting System&#13;
4.11          The financial statements continue to be based on the former Soviet Union cash based&#13;
accounting system. External auditing according to normally accepted international practices has not been&#13;
made, although municipal officials undertake an annual review of the accounts. State officials also make&#13;
an annual tax inspection. The SW Action Plan will prescribe the transition to an internationally recognized&#13;
accounting system.&#13;
4.12          SW's historical financial statements should not be utilized to judge past financial&#13;
performance, or be compared with the current financial position. Assets are revalued using an inflation&#13;
index as opposed to a replacement cost procedure. The tariff study would address this issue in more detail.&#13;
4.13          The accounting is also undergoing computerization, but is still mainly carried out manually.&#13;
The project supports the installation of a Management Information System (MIS), which would be linked&#13;
with both operational budget planning and a strategic planning system.&#13;
E. Future Financial Performance&#13;
4.14          Financial projections show that SW is capable of servicing a total debt of approximately&#13;
US $6.0 million. The projections are built on recommended real tariff adjustments which would&#13;
achieve the following financial ratios.&#13;
debt service coverage ratio'3 above 1.5 each year;&#13;
working ratio of 60% or below; and&#13;
-      operating ratio below 85 %.&#13;
A summary of the financial projections are presented in Table 4.2.&#13;
13    defined as Net Profit after taxes, add back depreciation and interest, divided by interest payments and&#13;
principal repayments.&#13;

4.15          The proposed financing plan for SW would yield a debt-equity ratio which would not&#13;
exceed 20% during the project lifetime. Projections of SW's financial performance assume that its future,&#13;
outstanding long term debt obligation is only that owed to the Bank. The Bank loan is disbursed over a&#13;
four year period, at the end of which SW would have a long term debt obligation totaling US $6.0 million.&#13;
To insure financial stability, agreement was reached during negotiations that, except as the Bank shall&#13;
otherwise agree, SW would not incur any debt unless its net revenues"4, for the fiscal year immediately&#13;
preceding the date of such incurrence (or the twelve-month period prior to such incurrence, whichever is&#13;
greater) would be at least 1.5 times the estimated maximum debt service requirements offor any succeeding&#13;
fiscal year on all debt, including the debt to be incurred. (para 6. 3e). It was also agreed that SW shall not&#13;
declare any dividend or make any other distribution with respect to its share capital prior to December 31,&#13;
2001 (para 6.3J).&#13;
4.16          In the past SW was expected to pay Profit Tax (retained by MS) amounting to 20% to 26%&#13;
of profits earned. In view of up-front equity investments it is anticipated that from 1994 onwards, MS&#13;
would exempt SW from such taxes. During negotiations, it was agreed that MS would exempt SWfrom&#13;
income tax payable to MS on SW's net profit for eachfiscal year commencing with the fiscal year 1995 until&#13;
and including fiscal year 2001 (para 6.3g). The financial projections assume that SW will continue to be&#13;
exempt of such taxes. However, with tariff increases of 15%, 15% and 12% in 1996, 1997 and 1998,&#13;
respectively, SW would be able to pay profit taxes after year 2001, and still be able to meet the financial&#13;
targets.&#13;
4.17          The water and wastewater operations are expected to be financially sustaining and the&#13;
tariffs are expected to provide full cost recovery, provided that the revenue projections are fulfilled. This&#13;
would require that: (a) water and wastewater tariffs are periodically adjusted to maintain achievement of&#13;
the targeted operating ratio and full debt service cost recovery; (b) accounts receivables maintained at or&#13;
below current levels; (c) adequate levels of maintenance are provided; and (d) operating efficiency and cost&#13;
reductions are achieved through the institutional strengthening assistance. The estimated real tariff&#13;
adjustments over the 1996-1998 period are as presented in Table 4.3.&#13;
Table 4.3: Expected Water and Wastewater Tariff Increases (real)&#13;
Annual Increases&#13;
Year                 Real                 Nominal&#13;
1996                 15%                     45%&#13;
1997                 15%                     40%&#13;
1998                 12%                     32%&#13;
4.18          The above projected tariff increases, accumulated over a three year period would account&#13;
for a real increase of 48 %. These targeted increases over the next three years, are sufficient to enable SW&#13;
14    defined as Operating Revenues - Direct Operating Costs + (Provisions for bad debts and taxes - taxes)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
to meet the targeted levels of flnancial performance. With the projected tariff increases SW will be under&#13;
pressure to maintain and reduce the targeted levels of costs so as to be able to meet the projected working&#13;
ratio, operating ratio, debt service coverage ratio and return on investment.&#13;
4.19           During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, except as the Bank shall otherwise&#13;
agree, SW would adjust its tariffs so as to maintain for each of its fiscal vears, a ratio of total operating&#13;
expenses'5 to total operating revenues16 not higher than 85% (para 6.3h).&#13;
G. Tariff Affordability&#13;
4.20           The real tariff increases translated into an estimated nominal increases of 41 % in 1996. In&#13;
the case of Domestic customers, there is a possibility that they, as with industrial and public customers,&#13;
will also have to pay a VAT of 18%, effective January 1, 1996. Thus, the net increase in tariffs for the&#13;
Domestic Group of customers in 1996, could be equivalent to 67% in nominal terms.&#13;
4.21           Given the estimated real tariff increase of approximately 48 % over a period of three years,&#13;
adding the effect of the new VAT of 18 % for Domestic Customers, and a real income growth, the water&#13;
service tariffs would correspond to an average of approximately 4.5 % of the average household income.&#13;
In general, water and wastewater tariffs consisting of 3-5 % of average household income has been&#13;
considered acceptable in other Bank financed water and wastewater projects. Affordability and the&#13;
necessity of extending the social safety net to the lowest income categories was reviewed and discussed in&#13;
detail with MS during appraisal. A mitigation plan for tariff affordabiliy has been prepared by the MS. MS&#13;
intends to support its approximately 12,000 poorest citizens (defined as pensioners, disabled and family's&#13;
with 4 or more children) in mitigating any hardship caused by tariff increases due to the proposed Project.&#13;
MS intends to finance this from its own budget, allocated into a special fund and administer it in the same&#13;
manner as support for heating bills. Assumptions underlying the affordability estimates are presented in&#13;
Annex 10.&#13;
H. Financial Risks and Mitigation&#13;
4.22           The key factors affecting SW's financial sustainability are: (a) tariff levels for water and&#13;
waste water; (b) direct operating costs; (c) debt service burden; (d) depreciation; and (f) foreign exchange&#13;
risks. In addition to the Base Case financial scenario presented in Annex 9, the analysis includes sensitivity&#13;
of the financial parameters to various tariff levels. Given the political sensitivity of water and waste water&#13;
tariffs, there is always a risk that tariffs would not be increased in real terms. Under such circumstances&#13;
as shown in the annex, SW would be unable to meet any of the required levels of financial pararneters, and&#13;
in the years when the debt repayment on the World Bank loan starts, the debt service coverage ratio would&#13;

incorporate maintenance costs, environmental charges, depreciation, and interest on long term loans, short&#13;
term loans, other financial costs.&#13;

from delayed payments and the compulsory reserve fund.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
decline below 1.5. To mitigate the risk that tariffs would not be increased in real terms, during&#13;
negotiations the tariff increase program, given in Table 4.3, would be agreed with GoLI and MS.&#13;
4.23          Real increases in operating costs could risk SW's financial health especially during the next&#13;
few years (Annex 9). The mitigation of cost increases lies primarily in the control of SW. However, cost&#13;
control, unless systematized and well defined, can be ineffective. The Action Plan of SW would include&#13;
the key actions to be taken to ensure that cost control will remain a high priority for SW management. It&#13;
should be noted that even though the number of employees in SW is significantly higher than in comparable&#13;
western utilities, the relative ratio between the various operational costs (staff, energy etc.) is quite normal.&#13;
In the Base Case financial scenario for SW, it is assumed that for the future years, total staff costs would&#13;
remain constant at 1995 levels in order to attract more skilled workers. Energy costs are expected to&#13;
increase by about 4% in real terms in 1996 and by 15% in 1997. The latter increase is because SW will&#13;
commission the new Waste Water Treatment Plant, a significant sub-component of the proposed Project.&#13;
4.24          SW is currently projected to be able to meet all its debt repayment obligations, except&#13;
under the scenario of zero real increases in tariffs. In the Base Case scenario, the debt repayment period&#13;
(for SW) has been reduced from 20 years including 5 years grace to 10 years of debt repayment with four&#13;
years grace. SW can (with the real tariff increases projected in Table 4.3) meet the required debt service&#13;
coverage ratio of 1.5 and above. Given the fact that repaying a hard currency loan over a long period of&#13;
time, exposes the entity to foreign exchange risks, it is recommended that SW repay the long term debt in&#13;
a shorter period. Institutional strengthening would help mitigate the above risks.&#13;
4.25          Utilization of a Financial Rate of Return is not appropriate, as it would by default be&#13;
determined by the tariffs. Return on investment defined as gross profit before interest and taxes is&#13;
approximately 4%, keeping in mind that around 70% of the capital investments are grant. However, the&#13;
real rate of return of the proposed Project is higher as additional Project benefits are externalities which&#13;
cannot easily be quantified nor incorporated into SW's financial analysis.  These include direct&#13;
environmental benefits and indirect financial benefits to the regional economy from reduced health costs,&#13;
reduced transboundary water pollution, improved environment quality, enhanced aesthetic conditions, and&#13;
increased domestic tourism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1          The proposed Project is a necessary step for the GoLI to fulfill its obligations under the&#13;
international treaty of HELCOM. Without the proposed Project, they would not be able to reduce water&#13;
pollution originating from Lithuania, as agreed in the treaty. The benefits from the proposed Project are&#13;
considered to be not only national, but regional and it has been included in the country's Public Investment&#13;
Program, endorsed by the Parliament. The direct economic benefits of the proposed Project are difficult&#13;
to quantify. The tangible benefits include positive impact on health, implying lower health care costs, and&#13;
positive impact on tourism, implying increased tourism revenues. In addition, short term direct benefits,&#13;
include employment opportunities for Lithuanian technical experts, skilled workers and laborers during the&#13;
construction period of the proposed Project. The non tangible benefits are more difficult to capture in&#13;
monetary terms, although it is clear that the net development impact from the proposed Project is clearly&#13;
positive.&#13;
5.2          The physical indicators below provide an indication of the overall positive impact of the&#13;
proposed Project. Project performance indicators would be monitoried by the implementing agencies as&#13;
described in Annex 1.&#13;
(a)   Improved Water Quality and Reduction of Transboundary Follution. The water quality of&#13;
the Upper Lielupe River Basin would increase significantly through reduced discharges of&#13;
organic material, phosphorous and nitrogen into the Kulpe River, thus preserving natural&#13;
resources. The proposed Project would support the commitments of the GoLI, to fulfill&#13;
the "HELCOM" recommendations by reducing the BOD level of wastewater discharged&#13;
at Siauliai from 90 mg/l to 15 mg/l. The discharge reductions would reduce transboundary&#13;
water pollution from Lithuania into Latvia within the basin and the Gulf of Riga;&#13;
(b)    Cost Effective Provision of Good Water and Wastewater Services in Siauliai. Siauliai&#13;
Water's organizational restructuring, technical assistance, and the proposed investments&#13;
would strengthen its' managerial efficiency, financial viability, service quality, and&#13;
capacity to plan and implement investments. The drinking water quality would be&#13;
improved through iron removal and softening. Full cost recovery through tariffs together&#13;
with metering would encourage water conservation, and water losses would be reduced&#13;
through leakage control and rehabilitation. A targeted social safety net, independent from&#13;
tariffs would minimize any negative impact of the proposed Project on the low income&#13;
households. At the technical level, the WWIC would provide opportunities for Lithuanian&#13;
experts to gain direct practical experience in the design, construction, operation, and&#13;
maintenance of the modern water and wastewater system. This process would allow for&#13;
effective transfer of technology;&#13;
(c)    Enhanced Regional Environmental Cooperation and Coordination. Regional environmental&#13;
cooperation would be improved through joint strengthening of the International Lielupe&#13;
River Basin Commission, and twinning arrangement between the Commission and an&#13;
international partner. The twinning arrangement would support the transfer of experience&#13;
and training of personnel in the complex issues related to basin management and provide&#13;
the basis for both short- and long-term cooperation with another management organization;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
(d)     Aesthetic Improvements and Recreational Benefits. The Kulpe River (that runs through the&#13;
city of Siauliai and just by the "Hill of Crosses") would be transformed from a highly&#13;
polluted "septic ditch" to a more normal channel. Recreational use of large portions of the&#13;
western tributaries of the upper Lielupe River which are currently heavily polluted would&#13;
increase. The water quality would improve at the popular recreational beaches of the&#13;
Latvian tourist resort of Jurmala;&#13;
(e)     Better Evaluation of Environmental Problems and Management of Surface Water and&#13;
Regulatory Enforcement. A strengthened environmental monitoring capacity at the&#13;
regional and local levels would allow for better evaluation of problems and management&#13;
of surface waters and more effective regulatory enforcement, more accurate esti-mvio 1 an(I&#13;
collection of environmental fees and fines; and&#13;
(f)     Demonstration of Low Cost Control Measures for Agricultural Run-off. Model  ,N vities&#13;
for cost-effective pollution control activities at pig farms could be replicaleci ,t other&#13;
locations within the basin and in Lithuania, thus allowing for an incremental reduction of&#13;
pollution in the basin. Implementation of non-point source pollution control measures in&#13;
a model basin through extension activities, improved agricultural practices and low-cost&#13;
control measures, would provide an on-site location for the transfer of experience and the&#13;
training of farmers within the basin and strengthen the developing Baltic regioial network&#13;
of demonstration sites.&#13;
B. Project Risks and Sustainability&#13;
5.3             The sustainability of the proposed Project depend on the sense of project ownership of the&#13;
implementing parties. This has and will be promoted through close cooperation and a high degree of public&#13;
participation in the preparation and implementation of the proposed Project. There are a number of critical&#13;
variables for a positive net development impact. Table 5.1 presents the factors that are anticipated to&#13;
create the greatest risk for the proposed Project and the available mitigation measures.&#13;
Table 5.1. Project Risks and Mitigation Measures.&#13;

complexities of compliance with Bank procedures for&#13;
procurement, accounting, and disbursement.&#13;
Cost Overruns. Construction costs may be underestimated   Project design has been based on conservative approaches to&#13;
because of the very  limited experience with  actual  cost estimation combined with the use of appropriate physical&#13;
implementation costs for water and wastewater improvements  and price contingencies.&#13;
in post-Soviet Lithuania, the volatility of local prices, and&#13;
previous lack of experience with construction activities&#13;
executed to international standards in this sector.&#13;

borrows in foreign exchange.                           pass on all cost of borrowing to the final consumers. SW's&#13;
cash flow is allowing for a relatively short repayment period&#13;
of the subsidiary loan from the Borrower to SW (10 years)&#13;
which would reduce the time during which SW is exposed to&#13;
the exchange risk.&#13;
Local Funding Availability. On the basis of previous Bank    Monthly disbursement requirements for local funding have&#13;
experience in Eastern Europe, there is a risk that the GoLl    been drafted for government and municipal contribution. Final&#13;

SIAULIAI ENVIRONMENT PROJECT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
1.            Actions to Monitor Development Objectives. Given the essential role program&#13;
monitoring and evaluation play in determining the impact of a given intervention on development&#13;
objectives, a number of project performance indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate progress&#13;
during the implementation of the Siauliai Environment Project. At the rnid-term review, the need to&#13;
fine-tune the Project design will be based on the data received from these indicators.&#13;
2.            Project Indicators. Project monitoring indicators were developed during appraisal in&#13;
order to enable tracking of Project inputs on key development objectives throughout the Project cycle.&#13;
These indicators would be developed further during the project start up. The progress of these indicators&#13;
would be evaluated in relative, not absolute terms. During supervision, a selected number of operational,&#13;
financial and environmental indicators would be monitored in accordance with Project objectives. An&#13;
illustrative list of indicators follows for each component of the project.&#13;
(i)    Water and Wastewater Improvement Component. These indicators would be recorded on a&#13;
monthly basis by Siauliai Water and included in the Project Implementation Unit's (PIU) regular&#13;
reporting to the Bank.&#13;
(a)    Operational indicators.&#13;
-      The quantity of water that is produced (extracted) and the quantity of water that is&#13;
sold are both going to be monitored. The ratiol (Water produced - Water sold) I&#13;
Water produced } is expected to fall over time as the reliability of the water&#13;
supply distribution system improves;&#13;
-      The collection ratio (total collections divided by total billings) for the industrial,&#13;
commercial, and residential sectors are expected to improve; arrears are also&#13;
expected to fall;&#13;
-      The total cost of extracting water that is not sold, and of selling water from which&#13;
revenues are not collected is going to be monitored and expressed as a percentage&#13;
of operational profits. This percentage should fall over time.&#13;
(b)   Financial indicators.&#13;
The average unit price adjustments for water and sewerage supplied for each&#13;
consumer category (the tariff schedule) would be monitored in accordance with&#13;
the Loan and Project Agreements;&#13;
In addition to the internal rate of return, the following standard financial&#13;
indicators would be monitored:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                     ANNEX 1&#13;
A Debt Service Coverage Ratio (the extent to which internal cash&#13;
generation covers total debt services) not to fall below 1.5;&#13;
A Working Ratio (ratio of operating costs to operating revenues,&#13;
excluding depreciation, interest payments, and debt service payments) not&#13;
to exceed 70%;&#13;
An Operating Ratio (ratio of operating costs to operating revenues,&#13;
including depreciation and interest payments but excluding debt service&#13;
payments) not to exceed 85%; and&#13;
A Current Ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) not to fall&#13;
below 2.0.&#13;
(c)     Environmental indicators&#13;
-      Number of breaks and trouble calls on the water supply and distribution system;&#13;
-      Number of breaks and trouble calls on the wastewater collection and conveyance&#13;
system;&#13;
-      Level of pollution load reduction achieved by the upgraded wastewater treatment&#13;
plant;&#13;
-      Levels of pollution load reduction achieved at a number of selected locations.&#13;
(ii)    Environmental Management Component. These indicators would be recorded on a monthly&#13;
basis by the regional environmental coordinator and included in the regular reporting to the Bank.&#13;
Measurements of water quality would be performed by the Regional Environmental Offices of&#13;
Siauliai and Panevezys.&#13;
(a)    Activity No. 1: Direct support for the Lithuanian side of the Lielupe River Basin&#13;
Commission. Cooperation between Latvia and Lithuania should perform satisfactory with&#13;
respect to the management of water quality in the Lielupe River Basin. This includes:&#13;
-      regular meetings between the Lithuanian and Latvian sides of the Lielupe&#13;
River Basin Commission;&#13;
-      establishment of a functional office in Siauliai directly supporting the&#13;
Commission;&#13;
-      establishment of a Geographic Information System for the Commission;&#13;
and&#13;
-      establishment of an emergency warning system.&#13;

DRAFT ACTION PLAN FOR&#13;
SIAULIAI WATER&#13;
October 20, 1995&#13;
Siauliai Environment Project&#13;
1.           The management of Siauliai Water (SW) has decided to initiate the preparation and&#13;
implementation of an Action Plan to improve the technical, financial and management performance of the&#13;
utility through investments and management development, in order to (a) improve the quality of its&#13;
services; (b) internally generate funds to finance its operations, maintenance and infrastructure; and ¢&#13;
service the repayment of long term loans. This Action Plan states the SW's operational, organizational and&#13;
financial goals in the short- and medium term and proposed additional steps for enabling efficient&#13;
implementation of the proposed capital investments and development of SW into an autonomous utility.&#13;
These steps include changes in governance, tariff setting practices, operational restructuring, and incentives&#13;
for enterprise efficiency.&#13;
2.            A number of actions are needed to enable SW to achieve its objectives. Issues that require&#13;
special attention have been identified, and these include:&#13;
-      Governance Framework;&#13;
-     Enterprise Strategy;&#13;
-      Operational Restructuring and incentives for enterprise efficiency; and&#13;
-     Technical and Financial Management.&#13;
3.           Governance Framework. The City of Siauliai will revise the governance of SW and&#13;
clarify the distribution of decision making powers between the Municipality, the City Council, City&#13;
Executive Committee and the utility in the area of water and wastewater services (see Appendix 1).&#13;
4.            The proposal for the revision of the governance system was discussed during the loan&#13;
negotiations with the World Bank in October, 1995. It is anticipated that the proposed changes will be&#13;
completed by the time of effectiveness of the proposed loan.&#13;
5.            Enterprise Strategy. SW will prepare a long term Strategic Plan based on the Feasibility&#13;
Studv prepared by Scanenvironment and it will cover the time span up to year 2010. A proposed outline&#13;
of the Strategic Plan is attached as Appendix 1. It is anticipated that the Twinning Partner would assist SW&#13;
in drafting the Strategic Plan. A draft strategic plan will be prepared by July 1, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                     ANNEX 2&#13;
6.            Operational Restructuring and Enterprise Efficiency. SW will prepare an Operational&#13;
Restructuring Plan in conformity with the current investment program and the revised Enterprise Strategy.&#13;
The objective of operational restructuring is to improve productivity and cost efficiency of SW and thus&#13;
reduce pressures for tariff increases (see Appendix 2 for details). The Operational Restructuring Plan will&#13;
be completed by September 30, 1996&#13;
7.            Technical and Financial Management. Siauliai Water will be contracting technical and&#13;
financial management assistance through a Twinning Arrangement with a Nordic water and wastewater&#13;
utility. Terms of reference for the Twinning Arrangement have been developed in coordination with the&#13;
World Bank (Appendix 4) and should be considered as an integrate part of this Action Plan. This Action&#13;
Plan would be implemented with the assistance of the Twinning Partner. Technical and financial&#13;
management issues not directly mentioned in the Terms of Reference for the Twinning Arrangement&#13;
include:&#13;
1.    Tariff Structure. A detailed tariff study will be carried out by October 30, 1996. The&#13;
recommendations of the study would be implemented by June 30, 1997; and&#13;
2.     Tariff Level. The tariff level should be structured so as to allow the utility to achieve&#13;
a cash flow level adequate enough to:&#13;
-      service debt obligations at a cash flow generation level which does not&#13;
allow the debt service coverage ratio' to fall below 1.5 each year;&#13;
-      achieve a working ratio2 of 60% or below; and&#13;
-      achieve an operating ratio, below 85 %.&#13;
While awaiting the results of the Tariff Study, the tariffs would be increased by at least&#13;
15% in real terms by March 15, 1996.&#13;
3.     Revenue Collection.  SW  will improve revenue collection by taking control of all&#13;
collection systems (including collection from Municipal Housing Enterprises), pressuring&#13;
defaulters, obtaining additional authority for debt recovery through the court system and&#13;
providing incentives to customers who pay promptly. By December 31, 1996, Siauliai&#13;
Water will:&#13;
produce a Lomprehensive statement of accounts receivable by consumer&#13;
category and age;&#13;
I      Debt service ratio =( net profit - depreciation +interest expense) divided by (interest expense + loan repayment).&#13;
2      Working ratio = operating expenses divided by revenue&#13;
3      Operating ratio = operating costs, depreciation, and interest expense divided by revenue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3                                    ANNEX 2&#13;
iimplement a program of improved recovery of outstanding accounts; and&#13;
for the financial year of 19964, include a provision in the income&#13;
statement for non-performing receivables.&#13;
4.    Performance Standards. Development of quality standards for each service (e.g. water&#13;
quality, leak reports, water pressure etc. based on corresponding EU standards. A set of&#13;
phased quality standards would be developed by January 1, 1998.&#13;
5.    Environmental Monitoring. In coordination with the Municipal and Regional Environment&#13;
Offices to establish a computer based environmental monitoring program to evaluate the&#13;
current and future performance of the collection system, treatment processes and status of&#13;
receiving water. This program should be established by October 1, 1996.&#13;

Appendix 2&#13;
Operational Restructuring and Asset Divestiture&#13;
1.            Objectives. Currently major operational changes of SW  are difficult, however SW&#13;
management, must identify and influence future trends. SW must actively promote organizational&#13;
restructuring, because only productivity increases and improvements in service quality, reflected in lower&#13;
costs and customer satisfaction, will justify higher wages and technological progress at SW. The objectives&#13;
of operational restructuring are to:&#13;
(a)    improve productivity, cost efficiency and employee motivation at SW;&#13;
(b)    reduce need for tariff increases; and&#13;
(c)    release idle assets through divestment.&#13;
2.            Current facts. The current capital and labor productivity of SW is low by international&#13;
standards (initially estimated at 10 - 30 % of western best practice) for three main reasons:&#13;
(a)    Outdated technology;&#13;
(b)    Inefficient organization of work; and&#13;
(c)    Lack of sub-contracting services.&#13;
3.            The current investment program will address the outdated technology and gradually reduce&#13;
the need for staff in many core and support functions.&#13;
4.            Functional restructuring. In order to improve its efficiency, SW should concentrate on&#13;
its core functions, i.e. tasks that are directly related to the provision of water and the treatment of&#13;
wastewater. The productivity of these functions must be constantly improved through investments and&#13;
better organization of work. At the same time, service quality and customer orientation must be drastically&#13;
improved.&#13;
5.            SW  will identify support functions, i.e. tasks that are not directly connected with the&#13;
provision of water and wastewater services. SW will analyze these functions with the assistance of a&#13;
consultant and suggest measures to gradually separate these functions and related assets from SW, if found&#13;
to be feasible.&#13;
6.            "In-house" versus sub-contracted services. The present manner of organizing activities&#13;
could be explained by following reasons:&#13;
(a)    Private services are not readily available;&#13;
(b)    Even if private services were available, private sub-contractors couldn't be&#13;
competitive with SW's in-house services, because of SW's low wage level in&#13;
comparison with the private sector;&#13;
(c)    Private contractors would have to pay Value Added Tax and profit tax, which&#13;
would make their services too expensive; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                    ANNEX 2&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
(d)    There are contractual problems in dividing responsibilities between SW and sub-&#13;
contractors.&#13;
These arguments are valid, but they may lead to biased conclusions for the following reasons:&#13;
(a)    Competitive private services will gradually become available as soon as there is&#13;
demand for them;&#13;
(b)    The present accounting practice at SW does not allocate costs in a correct way,&#13;
and therefore in-house services look cheaper than they actually are; and&#13;
(c)    There are many institutional and policy disincentives for small scale private&#13;
businesses; the climate for entrepreneurship will improve.&#13;
7.            SW will select one or two SW support functions, analyze the present operations in detail,&#13;
allocate the costs (including overheads) in a new way, and investigate alternative ways of doing things.&#13;
These simplified case studies will add concrete examples to the discussion on operational restructuring and&#13;
on core functions versus support functions. They will also demonstrate the potential for divestment and&#13;
revenue from asset sales.&#13;
8.            SW will take active steps to encourage the growth of competitive sub-contracting services.&#13;
Selected in-house projects should be subjected to outside competition on experimental basis, even if there&#13;
is little interest in SW's projects in the beginning. The rules and procedures of contractor selection must&#13;
be openly communicated to all interested parties. The growth of support services can take a number of&#13;
years, but SW should start the process now and show example to other public organizations.&#13;

"Twinning Arrangement" for Siauliai Water&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
1.            Background. With a population of 147,000, Siauliai is the fourth largest city in Lithuania.&#13;
The city's economic base is mainly industrial. The region surrounding Siauliai is flat and criss-crossed&#13;
by a large number of small rivers, forming the upper reaches of the Lielupe River Basin. Siauliai is&#13;
situated on one of the smaller tributaries draining to the Lielupe River, the second largest river flowing into&#13;
the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea. All of the municipal and industrial wastewater from Siauliai is emitted&#13;
into Kulpe, a small tributary of the Lielupe and, in summer, this often constitutes its entire flow.&#13;
2.            Pollution discharges to the river basin have reached such levels that there exist a public&#13;
health problem. Most sections of the river are unsuitable for recreational use, and several beaches of the&#13;
Latvian coast at Jurmala, the country's main summer resort area, have been closed for swimming for years&#13;
as a direct result of pollution from the Lielupe River. The largest point source of pollution in the Lielupe&#13;
River basin is the city of Siauliai being responsible for approximately 50 % of the total discharge into the&#13;
basin.&#13;
3.            The Government of Lithuania has acklnowledged the problem and has committed itself to&#13;
reducing the pollution load meeting the recommendations of the Helsinki Commissiorn. lTrn-'ition, Siauliai&#13;
has been identified as a "Priority Hot Spot" in the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action&#13;
Programme (JCP), and it is included in the Public Investment Program, approved by the Lithuanian&#13;
Parliamentary Committee on Environment and the Cabinet of Ministers. The Government of Lithuania&#13;
and the Municipality of Siauliai is now discussing with the World Bank and the Governments of Finland,&#13;
Norway and Sweden potential funding of investments for technical, financial and institutional improvements&#13;
in the water and wastewater services in Siauliai. These discussions are based on a detailed study' assessing&#13;
the situation of Siauliai Water (SW).&#13;
4.            When planning the implementation of possible improvements in water and wastewater&#13;
services in Siauliai, it is important to bear in mind, that water and sewerage services in the country have&#13;
only recently been decentralized from state responsibility to the responsibility of the appropriate&#13;
municipalities. Therefore, water and wastewater facilities are not yet autonomous in accordance with&#13;
market-oriented management practices but managed as direct extensions of municipal governments. One&#13;
of the principal obstacles in promoting the creation of autonomous enterprises which could provide cost-&#13;
effective, affordable municipal services, is the municipalities' lack of experience in market-oriented&#13;
operational, organizational and financial management practices. Consequently, in order to facilitate the&#13;
development of the utility into an autonomous, service-oriented and efficiently run enterprise with modern&#13;
management practices, external support is required. As a part of the proposed Siauliai Environment&#13;
Project, it is recommended that an organized Twinning Arrangement between SW and a reputable foreign&#13;
water and wastewater company/ies be formed in order to achieve the overall project objectives. This&#13;
document sets out the terms of reference for such an arrangement.&#13;

5.           Objectives. The main objective of this Twinning Arrangement would be to improve SW's&#13;
overall performance through changes in it's operational, organizational and financial management practices.&#13;
These changes would be in accordance with a detailed Action Plan, which is under preparation by SW and&#13;
would be agreed by the World Bank. The overall objective of the Action Plan is to define and formulate&#13;
a strategic vision of the short- and long-term future of the company in terms of its operations, legal identity,&#13;
organizational setup and financial condition. A particularly important objective for the Twinning&#13;
Arrangement would be to provide SW with a commercial attitude and a sense of service directed at&#13;
providing the best water supply, and best wastewater services possible to its customers at an affordable cost&#13;
without further municipal or government subsidies in the future.&#13;
6.           Scope of Work.  The twinning partner/s, in close coordination with the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU), would support and assist SW to improve its operational practices in wastewater&#13;
services and water supply, and implement the Action Plan. This Twinning Arrangement would take place&#13;
during the first three year of the proposed project implementation period. Following this term, the "new"&#13;
SW would be expected to operate in accordance with modern utility management practices and be fully&#13;
equipped with computerized management information systems. The twinning partner/s would bring to SW,&#13;
state-of-the-art know-how in utility management, administration and operation.&#13;
7.           Working Arrangements. All activities and tasks under this arrangement are intended to&#13;
be carried out in close coordination of both/all twinning parties. Counterpart systems would be applied&#13;
whenever appropriate and the participation of a maximum number of SW staff would be emphasized. The&#13;
twinning partner/s would provide advisors recruited from its own staff and/or outside the utility, minor&#13;
equipment as agreed upon, and subcontract consultants as and when necessary. The selection of consultants&#13;
would be done jointly with SW. Cooperation under this Twinning Arrangement would be regarded as a&#13;
binding agreement betweeni the parties. A contract specifying duties, responsibilities, and fees and&#13;
expenses, would be established and agreed between the SW and the twinning partner/s. Each of parties&#13;
would nominate an English speaking twinning coordinator to be responsible for the execution of the&#13;
agreement. This contract and its execution would be supervised by the PIU and World Bank supervision&#13;
missions. Cooperation would be initiated by drafting and agreeing upon a specified work plan which would&#13;
include a detailed time schedule and budget. The work plan, time schedule and bLJget would be cleared&#13;
by the PIU and submitted to the Bank.&#13;
8.           Reporting. The Twinning Arrangement would follow the same reporting requirements&#13;
as the PIU. The twinning coordinators would be jointly responsible for preparing annual financial reports&#13;
and annual progress reports for each activity included under the twinning agreement. These reports would&#13;
be cleared by the PIU and submitted to the Bank.&#13;
9.           Main Tasks. The main task of the twinning partner/s is to further refine and improve&#13;
SW's Action Plan in order to create a long-term strategic vision of the future of the company. The&#13;
operational experience and knowledge of the twinning partner, including administrative, organizational and&#13;
financial competencies would be transferred to SW through support in the following three main areas: (a)&#13;
formulation and implementation of all management and administration procedures and systems; and&#13;
(b) formulation and implementation of a program for system rehabilitation and operational&#13;
improvements.&#13;

SIAULIAI ENVIRONMENT PROJECT&#13;
WATER AND WASTEWATER COMPONENT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.           Environmental Review. Development of the proposed Project has included preparation&#13;
of an environmental review consistent with the requirements of the Lithuanian "Rules for the Elaboration&#13;
of 'Environmental Protection' Section of a Study (RSN 153-93)" and the provisions of World Bank,&#13;
Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" for a project in screening category "B." The&#13;
environmental review was prepared by specialists from Scanvironment (Sweden) with financial support&#13;
from BITS of Sweden.&#13;
2.           Consultation Process. The environrmental review for the proposed Project was prepared&#13;
in coordination with the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP), Siauliai Regional Environmental&#13;
Protection Office (S-REPO), and Siauliai Municipal Environment Department (SMED). In addition,&#13;
consultations have been conducted by both the Bank and consultants with representatives of the&#13;
Municipality of Siauliai (MS) and Siauliai Water (SW). Meetings have also been conducted by the Bank&#13;
with representatives of the Latvian Ministry of Environment and Regional Development and the Jelgava&#13;
Regional Environmental Protection Committee to review current transboundary pollution impacts and to&#13;
assess benefits from planned pollution control measures to be supported under the proposed Project&#13;
3.           Protection of the Baltic Sea. Environmental conditions in the waters around the coast&#13;
of the Baltic Sea are presently in the focus of research, monitoring, and national and international&#13;
measures. Major remediation efforts are expected in the drainage area of the Baltic Sea to fulfil&#13;
international agreements. For this purpose, a Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Program was&#13;
initiated to implement nutrient reducing measures around the Baltic Sea, especially in the eastern part of&#13;
the drainage area (e.g. Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland). The decision to develop the Joint&#13;
Comprehensive Program reflects the recognition that the environment problems of the Baltic Sea and its&#13;
catchment area are inextricably bound together and that their solutions require cooperative actions. Many&#13;
corrective measures and pollution control investments should be carried out in parallel in order to improve&#13;
the ecological condition in the Baltic Sea, its coastal zone and its catchment area. Municipal wastewater&#13;
treatment plants, discharging directly into the Baltic Sea or its sub-basins, have a more direct effect than&#13;
treatment plants located upstream on rivers. However, it is also necessary to conduct measures upstream&#13;
in river basins, since those would, in addition to impacts on the Baltic Sea, have significant improvements&#13;
locally and regionally in the river drainage basin.&#13;
Existing Situation&#13;
4.           Municipality of Siauliai.  The proposed project is part of the Baltic Sea Joint&#13;
Comprehensive Environmental Action Program. MS has been identified as one of 132 "hot spots", which&#13;
are significant sources of pollution. The MS, with a population of about 147,000 people, is situated in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                    ANNEX 6&#13;
northern part of Lithuania, on the border between the drainage basins of the Lielupe River in the north and&#13;
the River Nemunas in the south. The major industries in the Siauliai region are mainly in the agricultural&#13;
sector; e.g. dairy, meat processing factories, brewery and soft drinks, glucose production, and tanneries&#13;
and leather industries. Other industries are the bicycle and moped industry, as well as furniture and&#13;
electronic industries.&#13;
5.           Water and Wastewater Treatment in Siauliai. The existing wastewater treatment plant&#13;
in Siauliai serves about 85% of the city's population (about 125,000 persons). All, except one industrial&#13;
plant which has its own treatment plant, are connected to public sewer system. Households not connected&#13;
to a sewer system have either pit latrines or septic tanks which discharge directly to the Kulpe River via&#13;
small ditches. The wastewater treatment plant is situated close to the expanding city. The poorly treated&#13;
water from the overloaded plant has had a significant detrimental influence on the receiving water, the&#13;
Kulpe River down to the confluence with Musa River some 20 km from Siauliai. Although the diminished&#13;
industrial activity has resulted in a reduced load of organic matter (BOD); from about 10 tons/day to about&#13;
2-3 tons BOD/day (corresponding to decreased effluent concentrations of about 200 mg/I to about 70 mg/I),&#13;
the discharge level remains high (HELCOM recommendation for BOD is 15 mg/l). Available analysis of&#13;
the NH4-N concentration in the effluent water from the wastewater treatment plant, made by the laboratory&#13;
at the plant, gives a load of about 305 tons NH4-N/year, corresponding to a concentration of 22 mg/I.&#13;
Respective figures for total phosphorus are 70 tons/year and 4.7 mg/l which is considerably higher than&#13;
HELCOM recommendation of 1.5 mg/l.&#13;
6.           To verify the accuracy of effluent quality data the discharges of nitrogen and phosphorus&#13;
from the wastewater treatment plant have also been calculated using average load figures per person widely&#13;
used worldwide. The methodology assumed the following parameters:&#13;
(a)    Nitrogen (N). 150,000 persons x 85 % connected x 10 g N/person and day = 465&#13;
tons N/year + 210 tons N/year from the connected industries = 675 tons N/year -&#13;
25 % reduction (assumed) of N in the wastewater treatment plant = about 500 tons&#13;
N/year discharged annually from the wastewater treatment plant; and&#13;
(b)    Phosphorus (P). 150,000 persons x 85 % connected x 2.5 g P/person and day =&#13;
120 tons P/year + 30 tons P/year from the connected industries = 150 tons&#13;
P/year - 50% reduction (assumed) of P in the wastewater treatrnent plant = about&#13;
75 tons P/year discharged annually from the wastewater treatment plant.&#13;
The calculated loads above are higher than the measured ones (25 % for N and 8 % for P). Later on this&#13;
environment review uses data for BOD and suspended solids provided by SW but P and N loads are based&#13;
on the above calculations. The summary is presented in Table 1.&#13;

7.           Discharges from unconnected households and stormwater, are not included in the above&#13;
estimates as no analysis is available to make a proper estimate. Those would probably add some 10 to 15&#13;
% to the loads presented in Table 1. As the Project will not have any impact on discharges from areas&#13;
without sewer or from the stormwater system, they have not been included in the analysis later on.&#13;
8.           The Kulpe River. The Kulpe River is a small tributary to the Musa River, which together&#13;
with the Memele River, are the two main tributaries to the Lielupe River. The Musa River is the collecting&#13;
river for all small tributaries from the Lithuanian part of the drainage area. The Musa River flows initially&#13;
east-wards, finally turning north and crossing the boarder between Lithuania and Latvia. The main sources&#13;
of the Kulpe River, Lake Rekyva and Siauliai Reservoir are located south of Siauliai. The total length of&#13;
the Kulpe River is about 35 km. The river length through the city is about 8 kIn, 7 lan are situated&#13;
upstream of the city of Siauliai and about 20 km downstream of the city. In the upper part of the river the&#13;
width is less than 1 m and before the river enters the Musa River the width is about 5 m. At certain parts&#13;
the river has been channeled off from its natural meandering downstream to the Musa River through&#13;
agricultural landscape. The agricultural land in the drainage area of the Kulpe River is extensively drained,&#13;
thus causing drainage water with nutrients to be transported from the soil to the river.&#13;
9.           The water flow in the Kulpe River is limited, especially during the summer season, when&#13;
only small volumes of water leave Lake Rekyva and the reservoir. The water flow in the Kulpe River,&#13;
during the dry period of May-July consists of nearly 100% of discharges from the wastewater treatment&#13;
plant, transforming the river into a highly polluted "septic ditch".&#13;
10.          No accurate water flow measurements have been carried out on the Kulpe River. The&#13;
annual mean water flow at the outlet of Lake Rekyva can be estimated at 0.3 m3/s and at 1 m3 /s in the&#13;
confluence with the Musa River. Annual variation in the water flow upstream of the wastewater treatment&#13;
plant can be great, with a water flow in the summer of 0.0 m3/s, and a water flow &gt; 25 m3/s during spring&#13;
thaw and fall rainy season. Estimated water flow characteristics for the Kulpe River are shown in&#13;

11.          No comprehensive physical-chemical and biological measurements has been taken in the&#13;
River Kulpe. The lack of accurate monitoring makes the evaluation of the present situation in the Kulpe&#13;
River and the environmental effects of the implementation of the proposed Project difficult. Table 3&#13;
illustrates figures for the water quality in the Kulpe River for 1994. These values have been obtained from&#13;
the laboratory at the wastewater treatment plant.&#13;

of Tables 2 and 3. As the quality data (Table 3) downstream of WWTP do not seem to correspond with&#13;
the real situation, the transport loads 1 km downstream and at the confluence with the Musa River have&#13;
been calculated using load data from WWTP and information about non point pollution from similar&#13;
conditions (agricultural land use pattern).&#13;

2)  NH4-N concentration is assumed to be 75% of the total nitrogen concentration.&#13;
12.           The Musa River. The Musa River is the collecting river for all small tributaries from the&#13;
Lithuanian part of the drainage area. The River flows initially eastward and later on turns north passing&#13;
the boarder of Lithuania and Latvia. The Lielupe River Basin Management Project financed by BITS has&#13;
established a few sampling stations along the River Musa. Unfortunately the data was not yet available&#13;
when this study was made. However, the collected data can be utilized during the monitoring phase of the&#13;
Proposed Project.&#13;
13.           The discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater from Siauliai city has a significant&#13;
impact on the aquatic ecosystems downstream of Siauliai; the Kulpe River and the Musa River. The&#13;
adverse impact is characterized by bad hygienic conditions, increased primary production, oxygen&#13;
deficiency, odor problems, fish kills, etc. Since available nitrogen and phosphorus figures for these rivers&#13;
are scare and the accuracy is questionable, it is not possible to calculate in detail the impact from the&#13;
Siauliai wastewater treatment plant. However, there is no doubt that the nitrogen and phosphorus&#13;
discharged from Siauliai city are the main source of nutrients transported in the two rivers. No other point&#13;
sources of this volume are located in the area.&#13;
14.           The Lielupe River. The Lithuanian part of the Lielupe basin comprises 11 administrative&#13;
districts, of which four are entirely situated within the basin, while the Latvian part covers a total of 9&#13;
districts. A total of about 843,000 inhabitants live within the borders of the Lielupe basin; 58%, or 485,000&#13;
on the Lithuanian side of the border, and 355,000 on the Latvian side. The Lielupe River is, with a water&#13;
flow at its mouth of roughly 110 m3/s, the second largest river discharging into the Gulf of Riga. The river&#13;
basin covers 17,600 km2 of land, equally distributed between the republics of Latvia and Lithuania, with&#13;
the upper reaches situated in the latter. The Lielupe river discharges at the city of Jurmala, about 20 km&#13;
west from Riga and the mouth of the larger Daugava river (discharge 680 m3/s).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                     ANNEX 6&#13;
15.           The runoff from the Lielupe basin constitutes about 12% of the total annual discharge to&#13;
the Gulf of Riga. The nitrogen contribution of Lielupe into the Gulf of Riga is about 20 %. Other data from&#13;
the lower reaches of the Lielupe river shows concentrations of nitrogen more than three times higher, and&#13;
phosphorus almost double as high as in comparable parts of the Daugava river (data from the beginning&#13;
of the 1990's). According to recent estimates about 12,000 tons of nitrogen (NO3-N) are annually&#13;
transported in the Lielupe River and discharged to the Gulf of Riga, and the annual phosphorus load is&#13;
about 200 tons (P04-P).&#13;
16.           Most of the pollution load of BOD (about 90%) and phosphorus (about 30%) of the&#13;
Lielupe River comes from urban areas (mainly municipal wastewater treatment plants receiving effluents&#13;
from both households and industries). The generally high pollution load from the treatment plants is mainly&#13;
a result of inferior treatment facilities, but also poor operation practices and toxic industrial sewage&#13;
discharged without pre-treatment into sewer system lower the effectiveness of treatment plants. The total&#13;
load from all urban areas (municipal sewage treatment plants) within the Lielupe River basin is estimated&#13;
to be approximately 7,200 tons of BOD/year, about 1,500 tons of nitrogen/year and about 230 tons of&#13;
phosphorus/year.&#13;
17.           The Gulf of Riga. Gulf of Riga is characterized by a high ratio of river outflow in&#13;
relation to volume, the low mean depth and the exchange of water with the rest of the Baltic Sea. The&#13;
changes of the water quality in the river discharge and in the Baltic Sea are well reflected in the Gulf of&#13;
Riga. During the last 20 years there have been increases in the winter loads of phosphorus and nitrogen,&#13;
giving an increased primary production. In spite of the increased nutrient supply, the oxygen concentrations&#13;
in the Gulf of Riga are not alarming. The ratio between phosphorus and nitrogen loads, together with&#13;
concentration measurements during the vegetation season, indicate that the primary production in the Gulf&#13;
of Riga is limited by phosphorus.&#13;
18.           The present discharges from the wastewater treatment plant in Siauliai result in a load of&#13;
about 500 tons of nitrogen and about 75 tons of phosphorus. If the retention of nitrogen and phosphorus&#13;
in the Lielupe River are roughly estimated at 50 % and 25 %, respectively, the discharged quantities from&#13;
the municipal sewage water treatment plant in Siauliai will result in an annual discharge to the Gulf of Riga&#13;
of 250 tons of nitrogen and 56 tons of phosphorus. These quantities are about 2 and 14%, respectively, of&#13;
the current estimated total nitrogen and phosphorus discharges by the Lielupe River to the Gulf of Riga.&#13;
This means that the discharge of insufficient treated sewage water from the municipality of Siauliai has a&#13;
minor influence on the nitrogen load on the Gulf of Riga, but has an important role concerning the&#13;
phosphorus load.&#13;
19.           The Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is one of the most polluted sea areas in the world. The&#13;
primary environmental problem is eutrophication. The eutrophic situation is caused by increased external&#13;
load of nutrients over decades. There is an essential difference between coastal and open sea problems. The&#13;
deteriorated coastal environmental conditions are mainly of national origin, while open sea problems are&#13;
the result of total pollution load from the entire drainage basin.&#13;
20.           Nitrogen and phosphorus are usually the limiting nutrients for the primary production in&#13;
aquatic ecosystems. For marine ecosystems, especially the Baltic Sea, there has been an intense discussion&#13;
about which of the two nutrients is the limiting compound. However, taking into account seasonal changes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7                                    ANNEX 6&#13;
and dynamics in species composition, differences between coastal and open sea areas, etc., both nitrogen&#13;
and phosphorus are considered to be limiting, especially in an annual perspective. There is a need for a&#13;
significant reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loads on the Baltic Sea. If a program to reduce the load&#13;
by about 800,000 tons of nitrogen and about 35,000 tons of phosphorus would be implemented over a 10-&#13;
20 years, the positive effects would be achieved after 40-50 years.&#13;
21.           The Sludge Lagoons. The existing wastewater treatment plant is located close to the city,&#13;
and some houses are situated just outside the fence of the plant. Earlier sludge was stored close to the plant&#13;
but since 1979 the sludge has been pumped to lagoons at the site of the new treatment plant (under&#13;
construction). The sludge has a high water content, as the plant has no de-watering equipment and also&#13;
the new sludge lagoons are rapidly filling. Today the lagoon area covers an area of about 80 ha and is&#13;
anticipated to be filled up in two years time. The sludge lagoons are an odor nuisance and result in insect&#13;
problems (e.g. mosquitos) during the summer season. During heavy rains there is a risk of leakage and&#13;
overflow, and there is also a long term risk of adverse impacts on the ground water.&#13;
The New Wastewater Treatment Plant.&#13;
22.           In the 1980's it was concluded that no extension was possible (due to the vicinity of&#13;
residential areas and lack of space) at the old treatment plant site and works at the new plant site were&#13;
started in 1990. The location of the new wastewater treatment plant is 8 km outside Siauliai and there is&#13;
enough space for any future extensions. No land use conflicts or odor problems are expected due to the&#13;
remote location. The Kulpe River will continue to receive the treated wastewater.&#13;
23.           The present wastewater flow is about 40 - 45,000 m3/day down from 60,000 m3/day in&#13;
1990. However, it is estimated that the flow could grow gradually but would not exceed 60,000 m3/day&#13;
in the medium term. The load on the Kulpe River has been estimated with a mean wastewater flow of&#13;
about 50,000 m3/day. The estimates are presented in Table 6.&#13;
Table 6.      The estimated future load of BOD, suspended solids, nitrogen and phosphorus from the&#13;

26.           Because of the lack of data necessary for calculating the situation in the receiving waters,&#13;
the potential environmental impact of the proposed Project can only be estimated. The proposed Project&#13;
would significantly decrease the discharged quantities of BOD, suspended solids, nitrogen and phosphorus&#13;
into the Kulpe River. See Table 8.&#13;
The water quality especially in the Kulpe and Musa Rivers but also in the Lielupe River would improve.&#13;
The positive effects include:&#13;
- reduced or eliminated odor problems;&#13;
- improved hygienic conditions;&#13;
- improved oxygen conditions in the river water and bottom sediment;&#13;
- decreased primary production (phytoplankton, periphyton, macrophytes) and improved&#13;
possibility for biological life in the river.&#13;

27.           The present discharge from Siauliai correspond to about 250 tons nitrogen and 56 tons&#13;
phosphorus at the mouth of the Lielupe River(the Gulf of Riga). The corresponding figures after the&#13;
completion of the Project would be 180 tons of nitrogen and 15 tons of phosphorus equaling to annual&#13;
reduction of 70 tons of nitrogen and 41 tons of phosphorus in the Gulf of Riga.&#13;
28.           The Lithuanian standards (under preparation), recommendations of the HELCOM (1988)&#13;
and to the EU directives 91/271 are presented in Table 9. These regulations are valid for plants loaded with&#13;
more than 10,000 person equivalents. According to the HELCOM recommendations the wastewaters&#13;
should be treated by biological treatment as soon as possible and not later than 1998, when the limit values&#13;
should be achieved.&#13;

29.           The final wastewater concentrations assumed for the new wastewater treatment plant in&#13;
Siauliai would fulfill the standards and guidelines for BOD, suspended solids and total phosphorus of&#13;
HELCOM and Draft Lithuanian regulations.&#13;
Proposed Mitigating Measures&#13;
30.           Mitigation Plan. The overall aim of the proposed Project is to implement measures which&#13;
would improve the water supply and wastewater services in Siauliai. The major environmental impact of&#13;
the Project would result from the improvement in surface and groundwater quality in the Project area&#13;
resulting in improved ecological conditions.&#13;
31.           Few of the impacts of the completed Project would be adverse and none are likely to be&#13;
significant and require mitigation. The impact of construction would be largely limited to relatively minor&#13;
disruption and disturbance.  Nevertheless, it should still be possible to reduce the extent of this&#13;
inconvenience by implementing some relatively straightforward measures to minimize these impacts&#13;
through clear requirements in the construction contracts combined with good construction supervision.&#13;
32.           Proposed Enviromnental Monitoring. A monitoring program should be designed,&#13;
including the frequencies and analyzed parameters to meet domestic and international standards,&#13;
recommendations and agreements. The program should be designed for:&#13;
*     Potable water quality monitoring (additional sampling and analytical work);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11                                    ANNEX 6&#13;
*     Municipal wastewater monitoring (influent, effluent and sludge), according to the&#13;
recommendations and agreements within HELCOM.   There should be&#13;
independent supervision of the performance of the wastewater treatment plant&#13;
carried out by the MoEP;&#13;
*     Industrial wastewater quality and quantity monitoring, including both industries&#13;
connected to the wastewater treatment plant and non-connected industries; and&#13;
*     Water quality monitoring in regard to physical-chemical and biological&#13;
parameters for the receiving waters of the Kulpe and Musa rivers.&#13;
33.           Proposed Sludge Handling. The long-term  target for sludge treatment and handling&#13;
should be recycling of the sludge for agricultural use. Sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants,&#13;
used in agriculture, is an excellent addition of nutrients (P and N) and organic matter to the soil. In order&#13;
to enable reuse for agricultural purposes, the sludge should be stabilized and should not contain harmful&#13;
substances (e.g. heavy metals and persistent organic substances).&#13;
34.           Institutional Strengthening and Human Resources Development.  The proposed&#13;
Project includes use of a "twinning agreement" to support institutional strengthening and human resources&#13;
development activities for Siauliai Water Enterprise. These activities would include training for Siauliai&#13;
Water Enterprise personnel in the collection, analysis and application of water and wastewater quality&#13;
monitoring to the operation of the utility. Support would also be provided for training of personnel from&#13;
the Siauliai and Panevezys Regional Environmental Protection Offices and Siauliai Water Enterprise in the&#13;
use of water quality data for the evaluation of trends in environmental quality and assessment of the impact&#13;
of the wastewater discharges on the river environment.&#13;

Major Project Components: (presents description of project components)&#13;
The proposed Project includes an Water and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC) and an Environmental Management Component (EMC) which&#13;
are intended to support implementation of the Baltic Sea Environment Program which identified Siauliai as a "priority hot spot.' The WWIC would&#13;
support Siauliai Water, the local utility, to undertake: (a) rehabilitation and upgrading of water treatment and distribution facilities; (b) rehabilitation of&#13;
elements of the old wastewater treatment plant and completion of major elements of the partially constructed new wastewater treatment plant; (c) actions&#13;
to improve sludge management and reduce the discharge of industrial wastewaters into the sewerage system; and (d) institutional support and training to&#13;
assist in establishing an autonomous and financially independent water and wastewater utility in Siauliai. The latter would include assistance for tariff&#13;
restructuring/tariff planning and financial operations and a twinning arrangement with a reputable foreign water and wastewater utility. The EMC would&#13;
include support for: (a) the 'International Lielupe River Commission;" (b) a regional and local environmental monitoring and laboratory systems; and (c)&#13;
technical and ftnancial support for selected activities designed to control pollution from pig farms.&#13;
Major Environmental Issues: (describes major environmental issues identified or suspected in project)&#13;
The WWIC of the proposed Project would result in: (a) improved water conservation and drinking water quality in Siauliai; (b) reduced infiltration of&#13;
water into the sewerage system and wastewater into the groundwater; (c) reduced discharge of partially treated and untreated municipal and industrial&#13;
wastewaters into the Upper Lielupe River; and (d) reduced industrial discharges and improved sludge management practices. All activities concerning the&#13;
new wastewater treatment plant would be conducted at an existing site which is removed from residential and cornmercial areas. The EMC of the&#13;
proposed Project would result in a strengthened river basin management organization and support improved control of point and non-point source pollution&#13;
would reduce discharges into Lielupe river and provide for the demonstration of low-cost control methods. Both components include activities to monitor&#13;
environmental performance by Lithuanian authorities.&#13;
Other Envronmental Issues: (describes environmental issues of lesser scope associated with project)&#13;
N/A&#13;
Proposed Actions: (describes actions proposed to mitigate environmental issues described in project)&#13;
An environmental review has been prepared for the proposed project by a joint Lithuanian and Swedish team consistent with the environmental review&#13;
procedures of Lithuania and those of the Bank. Preparation of the study was coordinated with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Regional&#13;
Environmental Protection Office and Siauliai Municipal Environment Department. Actions would be taken to mitigate disturbances during construction and&#13;
monitoring would be conducted for improvements in the wastewater treatment system.&#13;
Justzflcaton/Rationale for Enuronmental Category: (reasons for environmental category selected &amp; explanation of any changes from initial classification)&#13;
The project has been placed in environmental screening category "B" as the potential impacts are restricted in scope and are largely beneficial. The&#13;
proposed improvements and upgrading of the water and wastewater facilities have been approved by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Activities&#13;
for improved management of the Lielupe River basin are anticipated to a have positive impact on the environment and would be implemented under the&#13;
direct supervision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Proposed actions under the Project would not require involuntary resetlement or have&#13;
adverse impacts to known archaeological or historic sites.&#13;
Status of Category A Environmental Assessment: (presents EA stan-up date, EA first draft, and current status)&#13;
-N/A&#13;
Remarks: (gives status of any other environmental studies, lists local groups and local NGOs consulted, tells whether borrower has given permission to release EA, etc)&#13;
Preparation of the proposed Project has been coordinated with the ongoing work of the "Lielupe River Project' which is being conducted by a Latvian,&#13;
Lithuania and Swedish team. The Ministry of Environmental Protection, Regional Environmental Protection Offices and the Siauliai Municipal&#13;
Environment Office have directly participated in project design. Preparation of the Project has included a number of meetings with representatives of&#13;
national and local authorities and experts concerning the findings and recommendations of the consultants. Given the transboundary nature of the Lielupe&#13;
River, consultations have been conducted with the Latvian Ministry of Environment and Regional Development which strongly supports the proposed&#13;
Project as it would reduce pollution of Latvian surface and coastal waters.&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
1&#13;
UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OF THE FINANCIAL MODEL FOR SW&#13;
STATISTICAL DATA&#13;
1.    An increase in population of 0.6% for each year from 1995 to 2010, and a corresponding&#13;
increase in the number of people served by the Siauliai Water (SW) utility is assumed. The&#13;
proportion of the population is therefore maintained at 87% through out the project.&#13;
2.    The proportion of non-revenue to total water produced is assumed to remain flat at 20%.&#13;
This amount of 20% non-revenue water is low for a system such as SW, and indicates that&#13;
measurement of water production is probably not accurate.&#13;
INFLATION ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
3.    Average nominal water and waste water prices for the years 1992-1994 have been inflated&#13;
to mid- 1995 litas by the inflation factors as shown below.&#13;
122                     1993               1994&#13;
mid 1992 to mid 1995     mid 93 to mid 95    mid 94 to mid 95&#13;
33.78                   4.510              1.53&#13;
4.    The above inflation factors have been calculated using annual inflation from the middle of&#13;
the year to the middle of the next year. The annual inflation rates are in 1992 - 1021%, 1993 - 401%,&#13;
1994 - 72% and 1995 - 37%.&#13;
5.    For the Balance Sheet the 1992-1994 figures have been inflated from end of year to mid-1995&#13;
as shown below:&#13;
1992                    1993               1994&#13;

10.080            2.010              1.170&#13;
UNIT OF PROJECTION&#13;
6.    All projections are in constant US dollars for the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and the&#13;
Funds Flow Statement, using an exchange rate of Litas 4 = 1US$ on mid-1995 Lita figures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
2&#13;
LNCOME STATEMENT&#13;
7.    The tariffs for water and waste water are taken as given up to 1995 and have been converted&#13;
to mid-1995 Litas and then into constant US dollars. The Base Case Scenario projects real increases&#13;
in tariffs of 15% in 1996. 15% in 1997 and 12% in 1998.&#13;
8.    Revenues from other services include water limit fees and a BOD fee for waste water.&#13;
Sale of goods and services for both water and waste water are expected to reduce over time, as these&#13;
services will be contracted out more and more.&#13;
9.   Interest rate earned on delayed payments is assumed to be a nominal rate of 19% starting in&#13;
1995, and deflated to real levels to project interest earnings and interest charges in real terms.&#13;
Delayed payments are projected to be 2% of total water and waste water billed. Interest income from&#13;
the compulsory reserve fund (which is 5% of after tax profits each year) is calculated at 19%&#13;
nominal per year deflated to real rates and is shown as a separate revenue item.&#13;
10.   For the Base Case scenario, the staff costs have been projected to remain constant in real&#13;
terms for the period 1995-2010. The expected reduction in employees will not reduce the wage bill&#13;
in absolute terms due to the costs of redundancy payments and compensation of the remaining&#13;
employees who would be the better skilled and better qualified employees. Social costs are projected&#13;
at 31% of wages and salaries.&#13;
11.  In the Base Case Scenario, Energy and Material costs for water and waste water services, is&#13;
expected to increase by 4-5% in real terms in 1996, and then by about 20% in 199, and thereafter by&#13;
less than 1% each year up to 2010, with the exception of a 4% decline in 2003. This is due to&#13;
phasing out of one of the units of the water treatment facility. The large real increase in energy and&#13;
material costs in 1997, is primarily due to the commissioning of the new waste water treatment plant.&#13;
In the Base Case, it has been assumed that SW will introduce cost cutting measures so as to contain&#13;
the increase in energy and material costs to 15%. as opposed to the 21% projected for 1997.&#13;
12.   Depreciation has been calculated using a 30 year straight line for existing assets. For new&#13;
assets being created or existing asses being rehabilitated in the SW project, it is assumed that the&#13;
assets will be depreciated using straight line depreciation over 25 years for the water supply&#13;
facilities, 50 years life for the collection network and pipeline, and 10 years for the rehabilitated&#13;
existing waste water treatment plant. For fixed assets created from the investments financed by SW&#13;
after the project. straight line depreciation for 25 years has been assumed.&#13;
13.   Assumptions on the various environmental and other taxes are as follows:&#13;
*     VAT which was charged for 1993 and 1994, is projected to be 0 in future years since SW has&#13;
been granted an exemption on paying VAT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
3&#13;
*     Traffic tax is taken to be 0.5% of total water and waste water billed.&#13;
*     Land Tax, Natural Resources Tax, and Pollution Tax are projected to increase in real terrms&#13;
by 2% each year starting in 1996.&#13;
14.   Interest expenses on the World Bank loan have been calculated at the World Bank's current&#13;
level (7.2%) lending rate which is variable. The projections on interest expenses are made keeping&#13;
this current lending rate constant, through out the twenty year repayment period. The interest&#13;
expenses on the World Bank loan have not been deflated for these projections, assuming potential&#13;
devaluation, which cannot be easily projected. Thus by using the 7.2% interest rate through out the&#13;
project, interest expenses are in effect being kept constant.&#13;
15.   Other Financial Costs comprise of interest charged of 19% (nominal rate which has been&#13;
deflated using local inflation projections) per annum, on delayed payments to suppliers which is&#13;
assumed to be 0.1% of energy and material bills.&#13;
16.   Profit taxes are taken to be zero after 1994, since SW as a municipal entity, it will be exempt&#13;
from profit tax.&#13;
17.   SW used to pay taxes on State Capital at the rate of 7% per year. Out of these taxes, one-third&#13;
was paid to the Government and two-thirds went to an external account from which SW could draw&#13;
down for investments. Since the ownership of SW shifted from the Central Authorities to the&#13;
Municipality, the tax on State Capital is to be eliminated and instead there will be a property tax&#13;
equivalent to 0.5% on assets to be paid to the Municipality.&#13;
18.   Provisions for bad debts are expensed in the Income Statement. The provision for bad debts&#13;
is taken to be 5% of annual domestic water and waste water bills and 3% of annual public and&#13;
industry bills. It is assumed that the provisioned amount is accurate and there is a corresponding&#13;
write down of Accounts Receivable in the Balance Sheet.&#13;
19.   SW is required to set aside 5% of net after tax profits as contribution to a Reserve Fund.&#13;
Contribution to the Reserve Fund is shown as a separate row item in the income statement. In the&#13;
Balance Sheet, the compulsory reserve fund is included as part of Retained Earnings.&#13;
20.   The Income Statement automatically calculates for each year the projected Working Ratio&#13;
and Operating Ratio for each year. The Working Ratio is defined as operating costs (material and&#13;
energy costs, staff costs and environmental charges) divided by operating revenues (water and waste&#13;
water revenues, water limit fees and BOD fees, goods and services provided and interest earned on&#13;
delayed payments and on the compulsory reserve fund). The Operating Ratio is the same as above&#13;
with addition of depreciation and interest expenses to the numerator, while the denominator remains&#13;
the same.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;

BALANCE SHEET&#13;
1.    For the years 1992-1994 all Balance Sheet items expressed in Nominal Litas have been&#13;
inflated by the end of year to mid- 1995 inflation factors to constant mid- 1995 Litas. These have then&#13;
been converted to constant US dollars using the current exchange rate of Litas 4 = US$ 1.&#13;
2.    The Balance Sheet figures for 1994 are according to the figures presented in the Balance&#13;
Sheet of SW for this year.&#13;
3.    The projections for Current Assets from 1995 to 2010 are based on the assumptions described&#13;
below.&#13;
(a)   Cash and Bank Balance for 1995 to 2010 have been projected. using a minimum cash&#13;
balance requirement equivalent to six months of operating costs. The final cash and&#13;
bank balance for each of the projection years. is derived from the closing cash&#13;
balance calculated from the Source and Uses of Funds statement.&#13;
(b)   Accounts receivable are maintained at current levels, of 45 days of sales.&#13;
(c)   The provision for bad debts which have been expensed in the income statement are&#13;
presumed to be accurate and the Accounts Receivable are written down to the same&#13;
extent each year. The assumptions for provisioning for bad debts are: 5% of annual&#13;
domestic customer bills; and 3% of public and industrial customer bills.&#13;
(d)   Inventory is assumed to be 60 days of energy and material bills which is in keeping&#13;
with current levels.&#13;
(e)   Advance Payments made for energy and materials are assumed to be 10% of annual&#13;
energy and material costs.&#13;
4.    The Gross Fixed Assets of SW for 1994 is taken as given in the SW Balance Sheet and&#13;
converted into constant US Dollars. The project is expected to begin in 1996, and all new project&#13;
investments are added to the existing asset base as increments. Accumulated Depreciation has been&#13;
calculated as the total of depreciation on existing assets and on the incremental assets, as described&#13;
in the assumptions on the income statement. Investments in the Project Implementation Unit, is&#13;
shown on the Asset side as "Intangible Asset". It is also assumed that SW would continue&#13;
investments from 1998 onwards. financed through its own sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;

5.    On the Liabilities Side, Current Liabilities include the following:&#13;
(a)   Short term borrowing in 1994, is equivalent to US$149,000. No further short term&#13;
borrowing is projected for future years, since SW has adequate funds to finance its&#13;
working capital and short term needs.&#13;
(b)   Advance Payments received is about 0.4% of water and waste water bills. This&#13;
projection is based on 1994 level of advance payments to bills.&#13;
(g)   Accounts Payable for each year is projected at 45 days of energy and material bills.&#13;
(h)   Other overdue payments include - taxes and charges which have been maintained at&#13;
the same level as in previous years; wages and social charges which is 1 1% of the&#13;
total wage bill for each year.&#13;
6.    Long Term Liabilities comprise of the World Bank Loan of US$6 million, disbursed across&#13;
the calendar years 1996 to 1998, according to the financing plan shown in the SAR.&#13;
7.    The Owner's Equity for the past years comprised of State Capital which is the State's&#13;
contribution to the financing needs of SW. For the current project the Government will contribute&#13;
an equivalent of US$7.60 million in the form of a grant. This grant as well as the grants from&#13;
foreign governments for this project have been shown as a part of owner's equity.&#13;
8.    The Retained Earnings shown in the Balance Sheet for the year 1994 is as given in the&#13;
Balance Sheet of SW. However, there is some discrepancy between the retained earning as shown&#13;
in the income statement and those shown in the Balance Sheet. For the purpose of this analysis, the&#13;
Balance Sheet retained earnings of the previous years are assumed to be the correct numbers and the&#13;
build up of retained earnings starts with the retained earnings as stated in 1994. The footnote in the&#13;
Balance Sheet against retained earnings explains the compulsory reserve fund (described earlier 5%&#13;
of net profit after tax) is included in the Balance Sheet as part of Retained Earnings.&#13;
9.    The Current Ratio: is defined as current assets over current liabilities and indicates the&#13;
liquidity position of SW.&#13;
10.   The Return on Equity is defined as Net Profits after taxes and before dividends and&#13;
compulsory reserve fund contribution. divided by Owner's Equity.&#13;
11.   The Return on Investment is defined as Gross Profits before Interest and TaxeslNet Working&#13;
Capital + Net Fixed Assets.&#13;

SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS STATEMENT&#13;
I .    The Sources and Uses of Funds Statement projects the funds flow from 1995 to 2010, starting&#13;
with 1994 as the base year. The funds flow from operations are taken from the net profit after taxes&#13;
as projected in the income statement, with depreciation and interest costs added back.&#13;
2.    The funds from external financing are projected from the incremental growth in equity&#13;
financing and debt financing as shown in the Balance Sheet. These include the World Bank Loan,&#13;
the Grants from Norway, Sweden and Finland and the Grant from the State.&#13;
3.    The uses of funds show the incremental investments undertaken by SW and calculated from&#13;
the asset growth as shown in the Balance Sheet. As described in the Balance Sheet Assumptions.&#13;
the Funds Flow projections are set up in such a wy so that an luses between sources and uses&#13;
after satisfvin2 a minimum cash balance of six monthsf operating costs. will be used for future&#13;
investments. startin2 in 1998. These investments, further increase SW's asset base. and the assets&#13;
are depreciated using 25 years straight line depreciation.&#13;
4.    The Debt Service requirements includes projections on both interest payments and principal&#13;
repayment for future years. Since the World Bank loan to the Government of Lithuania is on-lent&#13;
to SW, the terms of the loan that have been adopted in the Base Case Scenario are those offered to&#13;
SW. The rate of interest is the same as the World Bank rate but the grace period and repayment&#13;
period has been reduced from 5 to 4 and 20 to 10 years respectively. As described in the&#13;
assumptions underlying the income statement projections, the interest payments on the World Bank&#13;
loan has been projected using the current interest rate (7.2% per annum paid twice a year) through&#13;
out the repayment period of 10 years. These projections are as if in constant dollars, from a&#13;
conservative perspective, given that future devaluations may end up increasing the debt burden on&#13;
SW in Lita terms. The principal repayment have also been projected in nominal terms for the same&#13;
reason.&#13;
5.    Non-cash working capital is defined as Current Assets (except cash) minus Current&#13;
Liabilities. The change in non-cash working capital is calculated from year to year from the Balance&#13;
Sheet, the assumptions for which are included in the previous section. Increases in non-cash&#13;
working capital is added to the uses of funds, whereas decreases in non-cash working capital are&#13;
deducted from the uses of funds.&#13;
6.    The opening cash balance for 1995 is taken as a given from the 1994 closing balance. The&#13;
future projections for closing cash balance of 1995 and cash balances for all future years are shown&#13;
in the last line of the Source and Uses of Funds Statement.&#13;
7.    The debt service coverage ratio for each year is calculated as net profit after taxes +&#13;
depreciation + interest costs divided by the debt service including interest costs and repayment.&#13;

            Lithuania - Siauliai Environment Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall purpose of the Siauliai
            Environment Project is to promote regional environmental
            cooperation, address pollution sources in the Upper Lielupe
            River Basin and promote its environmentally sustainable
            management and development. The project's objectives
            are the following: 1) reduction of various pollutant loads
            from the Siauliai area into the Upper Lielupe River Basin,
            thus decreasing the transboundary pollution into the river
            and the Gulf of Riga; 2) improvement of the quality,
            reliability and cost efficiency of water supply and
            wastewater services in Siauliai; 3) assist in establishing
            financially sustainable provision of municipal services; and
            4) improvement of the regional and local environmental
            quality monitoring and enforcement system in the Upper
            Lielupe River Basin. The project consists of two
            complementary components: 1) water and wastewater
            improvement component, which includes support for
            rehabilitation, upgrading, and expansion of the water and
            wastewater system, and which comprises three key activities:
            a) water supply and distribution; b) wastewater collection
            and treatment; and c) technical assistance and training; and
            2) environmental management component consisting of the
            following four activities: a) direct support for the
