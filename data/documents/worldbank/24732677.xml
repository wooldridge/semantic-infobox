COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
relating to&#13;
Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is er tered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   THE GOVERNMENT OF ALSTRALIA, acting through the DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN&#13;
AFFAIRS AND TRADE, of Canberra, Australia (the "Government of Australia"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPF IlIl T&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, U1 /, he&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvai ii:1&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("lIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, D. 2, 433,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank GroL p")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad internationa recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Inter -1 3t nal&#13;
Organizations (1Os), the G77, and the private sector represented by the B20 that investir gi the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging N arkets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to a x: 3nd&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic lr: wth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on 4:i ing&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coo cir ted&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize pivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robL st pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an 1:1 s is&#13;
understood to be the greates: barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm:  it&#13;
(D) Governments, development linance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in e*  t in&#13;
developing the market for private infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand : : , in&#13;
the numbers of structurally sound and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual em -:y ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range o pri ate&#13;
investors that actively partic pate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals wil I)E lefit&#13;
from collective action betwe en this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowl t dl to&#13;
find  solutions  to  complex  i ifrastructure  financing  challenges  that no  single  institutio i  uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure F E ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at levera( i I( the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of i istitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruct .iie vith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prep az on,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigation for individual infrastructure  investments. In this regard,  Ie  31F&#13;
aims to complement existin(i and proposed services and initiatives currently supportec :' the&#13;
Parties and other prospectivE GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepz 'ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure prciects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces: i i(i the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro  re tive&#13;
private sector financiers into )roject structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater Im e age&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular f  rge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure F E ility&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have come to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended o be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set c.J:&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Foindational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the GIF Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their colla :ii  tion,&#13;
they are of an indicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties anc wE i&#13;
other potential partners until he GIF is formally established. The final version of these objic ti as&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend tc work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to fL rther enhance their coordination, in particular by developing i ilF,&#13;
with a view to formally establ shing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the forec oing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to contirue t:&#13;
collaborate in developing the GIF, including but not limited to:&#13;

e. Any other aspects of collaboration required to finalize the design of the GIF, incluc ic&#13;
sharing best practice and experience with regard to project preparation, through t1 E ti ;e&#13;
of knowledge platfon ns for the infrastructure sector.&#13;
2.2   During the process of finali;:ing the design of the GIF, the multilateral development ban .E Ited&#13;
in Annex 2 will be  invited  o participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF d .,: i; 1 is&#13;
finalized, additional collabo ative efforts are required to develop the operational details 0i the&#13;
GIF, at all times complementing existing efforts and facilities and building upon the !- red&#13;
knowledge and experience of the Parties in this area. This includes determining the l V! I of&#13;
coordination between the Parties and project origination process.&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Preliriinary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the GIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructLre pc Jc ;ts&#13;
in emerging markets and dev eloping economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparat : *.&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercia r&#13;
institutional investor engagerient in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex pub ic-private partnerships and projects with potential for comme c&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastrL:. - 3&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coor( in on&#13;
resources in collaboration with the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of t .a v de&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE&#13;
infrastructure, with the input ind ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engageme -i c uld&#13;
stretch from upstream suppo t on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to dowr stream transaction preparation, financial structuring, anc risl&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemer t.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structurE:J&#13;
infrastructure projects, the G F can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset cla 3s attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long t 1&#13;
assets in faster growing ecoromies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profiles&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to o &gt;erate according to the following core principles, to be finaliz( c t on&#13;
agreement among GIF partn,rs:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities tl E : 'ill&#13;
draw together ccmparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing put lic goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thos&#13;

innovative and fl  xible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve great r&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that arE&#13;
beyond the reso irces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t&#13;
development and implementition of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p, r r rs&#13;
are expected to fall into one ,r more of the following categories:&#13;
6&#13;

infrastructure prjects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparE li:&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, witl a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial arid/or&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2 A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic prograrimir g,&#13;
management and use of funds, and development of operational policies and procedures; ir c&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial la 'ility,&#13;
leverage public f inds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- M. h&#13;
as through Publi -Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's se vice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastracture investments that have global public good characteristi :5 uch&#13;
as climate friendly-project3 that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisioi :)&#13;
infrastructure services; and t ade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconnE:. Vi y&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppcrt provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, witZ asw&#13;
to complementing the resour:.es and support already available from partner entities and o h:r&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following a&lt; tw es,&#13;
corresponding to major proje-t development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; pro ect definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility sc 3:w ng;&#13;
and legal, regula:ory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii)  Project preparati )n and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and P 1P structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, anc design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangiig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financ n;&#13;

6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies- ncluding in particular the management of environmental and 3:&lt;: al&#13;
impacts and risks, and transr arency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastr.ii :t -e&#13;
projects in supporting sustair able, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements ,r&#13;
external implementing entitie under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an ar proach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards anc It er&#13;
standards and policies, and c evelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for G&#13;
Technical Partners who are Expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activitie,,&#13;
