Economic Impacts of&#13;
Sanitation in Indonesia&#13;
A ï¬?ve-country study conducted in Cambodia,&#13;
Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam&#13;
under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
At 55% in 2004, sanitation coverage in Indonesia is below the regional average for Southeast Asian countries of&#13;
67%. Nationwide, sanitation coverage has increased by 9 percentage points since 1990, representing signiï¬?cant&#13;
progress towards the target of 73% set by the Millennium Development Goal joint water supply and sanitation&#13;
target. However, at current trends Indonesia will fall short of the MDG sanitation target by 10 percentage points,&#13;
equivalent to 25 million people. The Government of Indonesia recognizes that in terms of providing adequate water&#13;
supply and sanitation facilities, it is facing a â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦losing battle in keeping up with the population increaseâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
This study shows that the high number of people living with unimproved household sanitation is imposing large&#13;
ï¬?nancial and economic costs to the Indonesian economy, not only to private individuals but also to the public&#13;
and commercial sectors. The results of this study support the need for greater investment in water and sanitation&#13;
infrastructure and in promoting improved hygiene practices. The results will be of interest to national policy makers,&#13;
local authorities, civil advocacy groups, universities and donor agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Unimproved sanitation and hygiene have a wide array of impacts, which can be categorized into impacts on: health,&#13;
water-related activities, the external environment, life choices, population preferences, and tourism. For Indonesia,&#13;
impacts are evaluated for all these categories since they are all important at the national level. The study is based&#13;
on information from national and provincial data and surveys, smaller scale research studies, and consultations with&#13;
experts.&#13;
&#13;
In 2006, Indonesia lost an estimated IDR 56 trillion (USD 6.3 billion) due to poor sanitation and hygiene, equivalent to&#13;
approximately 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP). Figure A shows overall economic losses by impact type.&#13;
&#13;
At IDR 275,000 (USD 31.10) annually in urban areas, per capita costs of poor sanitation and hygiene were estimated&#13;
to be higher than in rural areas at IDR 224,000 (USD 25.40); however, signiï¬?cantly more people still do not have&#13;
access to improved sanitation in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
Of the impacts evaluated, health and water resources contribute most to the overall economic losses estimated&#13;
in the study. These impacts are expected to cause ï¬?nancial losses to populations, as shown in Figure A, who have&#13;
to pay for health services or who pay more to access clean water supplies, or who may lose income due to poor&#13;
health.&#13;
&#13;
Poor sanitation, including hygiene, causes at least 120 million disease episodes and 50,000 premature deaths&#13;
annually. The resulting economic impact is more than IDR 29 trillion (USD 3.3 billion) per year. Poor sanitation also&#13;
contributes signiï¬?cantly to water pollutionâ&#128;&#148;adding to the cost of safe water for households, and reducing the&#13;
production of ï¬?sh in rivers and lakes. The associated economic costs of polluted water attributed to poor sanitation&#13;
exceed IDR 13 trillion (USD 1.5 billion) per year. Poor sanitation also contributes up to IDR 11 trillion (USD 1.2 billion)&#13;
per year in population welfare losses (due to additional time required to access unimproved sanitation), IDR 1.5&#13;
trillion (USD 166 million) per year in tourism losses, and IDR 0.9 trillion (USD 96 million) in environmental losses&#13;
due to loss of productive land. A number of intangible eï¬&#128;ects, relating to the populationâ&#128;&#153;s preferences for a safe,&#13;
convenient and private place to defecate, were not quantiï¬?ed in this study but are known to inï¬&#130;uence population&#13;
behavior and overall welfare.&#13;

               With the universal implementation of improved sanitation and hygiene, it is assumed that all the attributed impacts&#13;
               shown in Figure A would be mitigated, except for health impacts, for which up to 45% of the estimated losses would&#13;
               be mitigated.&#13;
&#13;
               Figure B shows the gains according to diï¬&#128;erent components of sanitation improvement. The overall economic&#13;
               saving would be IDR 40 trillion (USD 4.5 billion) annually. In addition, the implementation of ecological sanitation&#13;
               approaches (biogas and fertilizer) in 900,000 households would be worth an estimated IDR 0.6 trillion (USD 67&#13;
               million) annually; and input markets generated from improved sanitation and hygieneâ&#128;&#148;corresponding to 2.3&#13;
               million households reached per year to attain the sanitation MDG targetâ&#128;&#148;could be worth an estimated IDR 5.3&#13;
               trillion (USD 600 million) per year, generating jobs and revenue for the private sector.&#13;

       Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Indonesia&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This is the ï¬?rst study in Indonesia to compile economic evidence on a range of impacts of poor sanitation and&#13;
hygiene. The results indicate that poor sanitation and hygiene have signiï¬?cant ï¬?nancial and economic costs, with&#13;
major implications for the socio-economic development of Indonesia and the attainment of short-, medium- and&#13;
long-term development goals. The study highlights the links between improved sanitation and several other MDG&#13;
targets, including poverty, hunger reduction, gender equality, child health, access to safe drinking water, and the&#13;
quality of life of slum-dwellers.&#13;
&#13;
The study demonstrates that poor sanitation aï¬&#128;ects everyone, but especially the poor and vulnerable, including&#13;
children, women, the disabled and senior citizens. Hence, sanitation should receive greater attention from all levels&#13;
of Indonesian government, and from development partners, the private sector and households. Decision makers&#13;
should act now, and in a concerted way, to stimulate demand for improved sanitation and hygiene practices, at the&#13;
same time increasing the opportunities for households to satisfy their demand.&#13;

&amp;#12;FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Foreword&#13;
              Indonesia, like other countries of Southeast Asia, is on a development path that is lifting large numbers of people&#13;
              out of poverty, and the economy is now growing at over 5% per annum. As well as economic growth, populations&#13;
              demand improved quality of life through improved health, housing, access to welfare services, and living&#13;
              environments. However, in a world of multiple government and donor priorities, some aspects of development&#13;
              remain neglected.&#13;
&#13;
              Sanitation is one such neglected aspect of development. Among the many priorities of households as well as&#13;
              governments, it is often pushed down the agenda, and left as an issue to be dealt with by someone else, or not at&#13;
              all. Indeed, without information on the link between sanitation and economic development, it is hardly surprising&#13;
              that sanitation is sidelined.&#13;
&#13;
              If governments and households are to be convinced that expenditure on improving sanitation is worthwhile,&#13;
              stronger evidence is needed to better understand the various impacts of poor sanitation: on health, the environment,&#13;
              population welfare, and, ultimately, on economic indicators.&#13;
&#13;
              Based on this premise, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in East Asia and the Paciï¬?c (WSP-EAP)&#13;
              is leading the â&#128;&#152;Economics of Sanitation Initiativeâ&#128;&#153; (ESI) to compile existing evidence and to generate new evidence&#13;
              on socio-economic aspects of sanitation. The ultimate aim of the ESI is to assist decision makers at various levels to&#13;
              make informed choices on sanitation policies and resource allocations.&#13;
&#13;
              The ï¬?rst major activity of the Economics of Sanitation Initiative was to conduct a â&#128;&#152;sanitation impactâ&#128;&#153; study, to examine&#13;
              the economic and social impacts of unimproved sanitation on the populations and economies of Southeast Asia,&#13;
              as well as the potential economic beneï¬?ts of improving sanitation. Once these questions are answered, national&#13;
              stakeholders can continue the discussions about policy making and priority setting armed with a better evidence&#13;
              base for decision making. They will be further supported in their policy debates following the completion of the&#13;
              second ESI study, a â&#128;&#152;sanitation optionsâ&#128;&#153; study, which will examine the cost-eï¬&#128;ectiveness and cost-beneï¬?t of alternative&#13;
              sanitation improvement options and management approaches in a range of settings in each country.&#13;
&#13;
              The research under this program is initially being conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and&#13;
              Lao PDR. While the WSP has supported the development of this study, it is an â&#128;&#152;initiativeâ&#128;&#153; in the broadest sense, which&#13;
              includes the active contribution of many people and institutions (see Acknowledgments).&#13;

              The Sanitation Impact Study was conducted in four countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.&#13;
              A study is ongoing in Lao PDR. The study was led by the East Asia and Paciï¬?c Oï¬&#131;ce of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and&#13;
              Sanitation Program (WSP), with the contribution of WSP teams in each of the participating countries. The study took&#13;
              one year to complete and has undergone two major peer review processes.&#13;
&#13;
              Guy Hutton (WSP-EAP senior water and sanitation economist) led the development of the concept and methodology&#13;
              for the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) and the management and coordination of the country teams. The&#13;
              study beneï¬?ted from the continuous support of other WSP-EAP staï¬&#128;. Isabel Blackett was the task team leader until&#13;
              December 2007, and Jema Sy, Brian Smith, Almud Weitz, and Richard Pollard provided inputs to concept development&#13;
              and study execution. Bjorn Larsen (WSP consultant) contributed to the study methodology and provided the ï¬?gures&#13;
              for malnutrition-related health eï¬&#128;ects of poor sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
              The country team in Indonesia consisted of Lydia Napitupulu (WSP consultant, country lead), and Dedek Gunawan&#13;
              (WSP consultant). Guy Hutton led report drafting and ï¬?nalization.&#13;
&#13;
              The ESI Indonesia study has been ï¬?nanced by the regional component of the Sustainable Sanitation for East Asia&#13;
              (SUSEA) Program, funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). ESI has also received funding&#13;
              from the UK Department for International Development, the Danish International Development Agency, and the&#13;
              Dutch Ministry of Foreign Aï¬&#128;airs. WSP and the report authors are grateful to the funding agencies for their support.&#13;
&#13;
              A large number of peer reviewers contributed their valuable time and ideas to the regional ESI study. Elena Strukova,&#13;
              Caroline van den Berg, Anjali Archarya, and Tracey Hart reviewed the methodology study before its implementation.&#13;
              The Indonesia study was reviewed by Foort Bustraan and Nona Pooroe Utomo (USAID / Environmental Services&#13;
              Program), and also beneï¬?ted from peer reviews of other country reports as well as the synthesis report. Peer reviewers&#13;
              of the synthesis draft report were (World Bank staï¬&#128; unless otherwise stated) Eddy Perez, Anjali Acharya, Pete Kolsky,&#13;
              Elena Strukova (consultant), Bjorn Larsen (consultant), and Peter Feldman (Plan International). Peer reviewers of&#13;
              the Cambodia country draft report were Hilda Winarta (UNICEF), Jan Lam (SNV), Chea Samnang (Ministry of Rural&#13;
              Development), Ruud Corsel (Niras-Scanagri, Vietnam), and Oun Syvibola (Plan International). Peer reviewers of the&#13;
              Philippines country draft report were Jema Sy and Andy Robinson (consultant). Peer reviewers of the Vietnam&#13;
              country draft report were Samuel Leibermann, Doan Hong Quang, Pham Khanh Toan (Ministry of Construction),&#13;
              Nguyen Viet Anh (University of Civil Engineering), Nguyen Kim Thai (University of Civil Engineering), Nguyen Van&#13;
              Thuan (Australian Agency for International Development), and John Collett (Plan International).&#13;

Introduction&#13;
&amp;#12;INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Sanitation is a global concern. One of the targets of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) is to&#13;
               halve â&#128;&#147; between 1990 and 2015 â&#128;&#147; the proportion of people without access to improved sanitation. Compared with&#13;
               other countries in Southeast Asia, in 2004 Indonesia was below average in establishing sanitation access, at 55%&#13;
               compared with an average of 67% for all countries in Southeast Asia1.&#13;
&#13;
               Forty-ï¬?ve percent (45%) of the Indonesian population without improved sanitation corresponds to one hundred&#13;
               million Indonesians without improved sanitation, that is, without an easily accessible, private and safe place to&#13;
               urinate and defecate. According to the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme, progress over the 14-year period&#13;
               between 1990 and 2004 has been slow in Indonesia, especially in rural areas where coverage increased 3 percentage&#13;
               points from 37% to 40% in a 14-year period, compared with an 8 percentage point increase in urban areas. While&#13;
               the 9 percentage point increase in 15 years is an impressive feat in a country of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s population size and&#13;
               geographical spread, progress is slower than in other countries in the region of similar economic development,&#13;
               such as Vietnam, which recorded a 25 percentage point increase, Thailand (19 percentage point increase) and the&#13;
               Philippines (15 percentage point increase). Figure 1 compares trends with national target ï¬?gures for rural (lower&#13;
               lines), urban (upper lines) and total sanitation coverage, up to 2015.&#13;

               Eï¬&#128;orts to increase sanitation coverage must also compete with population growth in Indonesia, which stands at&#13;
               an estimated 1.3% per annum. At this rate, an additional 2.8 million Indonesians will require improved sanitation&#13;
               facilities every year from now until 2015, thus adding to the 100 million people currently without improved&#13;
               sanitation. Forecasts at current rate of progress suggest that Indonesia will fall short of the MDG target of&#13;
               73% by 10 percentage points, equivalent to 25 million people2. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) recognizes&#13;
               that in terms of providing adequate water supply and sanitation facilities, it is facing a â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦losing battle in keeping&#13;
               up with the population increaseâ&#128;?3. Furthermore, signiï¬?cant rural-urban and inter-provincial disparities exist, which&#13;
               sanitation improvement eï¬&#128;orts must address. Figure 2 shows regional variations in coverage, ranging from 34% in&#13;
               West Sulawesi to 88% in Jakarta (see Annex Table C1 for population ï¬?gures and Annex Table C2 for coverage ratios&#13;
               by province and rural/urban breakdown).&#13;
               1    According to the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme, national coverage stood at 55% in 2004. Not all national surveys in Indonesia&#13;
                    give the same ï¬?gures for improved sanitation coverage. Annex Table A1 shows the sanitation coverage from four national surveys conducted&#13;
                    between 2002 and 2006.&#13;

Hygiene practices in Indonesia are another concern. A survey conducted in six provinces in 2005 found that less&#13;
than 15% of mothers cite washing hands with soap before or after ï¬?ve critical activities (see Figure 3). Given that&#13;
poor hygiene is a major risk factor for a range of infectious diseases that have a particularly large impact on children,&#13;
the low rates of improved hygiene practices are a major cause for concern.&#13;

                                                                                                      needed to meet the MDG target. As well as lack of top-&#13;

                                                                                                      adequately exploited, especially the potential for&#13;
                                                                                                      contribution by small-scale entrepreneurs. To date, most&#13;
                                                                                                      sanitation investment has been by household self-&#13;
                                                                                                      provision. Furthermore, starting in 1990, and notably with&#13;
                                                                                                      the onset of decentralization in 1999, the mandate for&#13;
                                                                                                      provision of water and sanitation services was passed to&#13;
                                                                                                      local governments, where technical capacity to provide&#13;
                                                                                                      water and sanitation services has been inadequate.&#13;
&#13;
               Hence a number of pre-conditions and actions are needed to raise the proï¬?le of sanitation in government as well&#13;
               as in household spending. One major constraint to further investment in sanitation is a lack of knowledge of the&#13;
               eï¬&#128;ects of inaction, and conversely, the role improved water supply and sanitation services plays in the development&#13;
               process. Therefore, evidence is needed to support advocacy for increased investment in sanitation; evidence that&#13;
               does not focus exclusively on a single impact such as health impact, but on the full range of impacts that also&#13;
               include water and environmental quality, population preferences, and the various knock-on economic impacts of&#13;
               poor sanitation. Indeed, economic evidence can be a powerful advocacy tool, at the higher level, in motivating a&#13;
               range of players who inï¬&#130;uence key government decisions and sectoral resource allocations; and at the lower level,&#13;
               in motivating households to make the decision to invest their limited funds in an improved latrine or toilet.&#13;
&#13;
               Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide decision makers in Indonesia with better evidence on the&#13;
               negative economic impacts of poor sanitation and hygiene, to provide sanitation stakeholders with a better&#13;
               basis for arguing for increased investment and for more rational policy making in the sub-sector. The study also&#13;
               seeks to generate tentative estimates of the impacts that can be mitigated by investing in improved sanitation and&#13;
               hygiene.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
              2.1 Study approach&#13;
&#13;
              This study in Indonesia employs a standardized peer-reviewed methodology5, which was also implemented in four&#13;
              other countries: Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam. The primary aim of the study is to provide&#13;
              national estimates of the economic impact of poor sanitation and hygiene. Results for selected impacts are&#13;
              also presented by provincial level, rural/urban breakdown and speciï¬?c population sub-groups such as women and&#13;
              children.&#13;
&#13;
              The study uses a modeling approach and draws almost exclusively on routine data sources such as national surveys&#13;
              as well as published studies. It presents the impacts in physical units and converts these into monetary equivalents&#13;
              using conventional economic valuation techniques. Results on economic impact are presented for a single year&#13;
              â&#128;&#147; 2006 â&#128;&#147; in Indonesian rupiah (IDR) and United States Dollars (USD). For those impacts where quantiï¬?cation in&#13;
              economic terms is not feasible, impacts are examined and reported descriptively. A complete listing of the equations&#13;
              used in calculating costs is provided in Annex A. Annex B shows the data inputs and results at national level, while&#13;
              Annex C shows the data inputs and results at provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
              2.2 Scope of sanitation&#13;
&#13;
              The term â&#128;&#152;sanitationâ&#128;&#153; is used to describe many diï¬&#128;erent aspects of hygiene and the disposal or recycling of waste.&#13;
              In the international arena, the sanitation indicator adopted as part of the Millennium Development Goals (target&#13;
              number 10 on water supply and sanitation) focuses on the availability of a private latrine and the safe disposal&#13;
              of human excreta. Despite the focus of the MDG target on human excreta, the importance of other aspects of&#13;
              sanitation is recognized. The management of human excreta, animal excreta, solid waste, agricultural waste, toxic&#13;
              waste, wastewater, food, and associated hygiene practices are all included in a broader deï¬?nition of sanitation.&#13;
              However, not all of these could be assessed in the present study. Table 1 provides an overview of which aspects of&#13;
              sanitation were included, with the main focus being on the human excreta aspect.&#13;

              2.3 Impacts evaluated&#13;
&#13;
              Poor sanitation has many actual and potential negative eï¬&#128;ects. Conversely, improved sanitation has a large&#13;
              number of potential economic impacts, as shown in Figure 4. The impacts of poor (and improved) sanitation are&#13;
              related to ï¬?ve main features: (1) latrine location, (2) latrine system, (3) hygiene practice related to human excreta&#13;
              management, (4) excreta isolation, conveyance and treatment or disposal, and (5) excreta re-use (recycling).&#13;

Based on this initial assessment of a long list of sanitation impacts, a shortened list was selected for evaluation in this&#13;
present study. These are&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Health impacts&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Water resource impacts&#13;
    â&#128;¢ External environment impacts&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Other welfare impacts&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Tourism impacts&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Excreta re-use&#13;
&#13;
Table 2 shows the ï¬?nancial and economic costs quantiï¬?ed in this study. Note that some impacts such as ï¬?sh&#13;
and tourism losses have multiple causes, and hence a fraction of overall losses are attributed to poor sanitation.&#13;
Economic losses include additional expenditures, income, productivity or time losses, and the value of premature&#13;
death associated with poor sanitation. Financial costs are distinguished from the broader economic costs, focusing&#13;
on direct out-of-pocket expenses or income losses. Non-pecuniary welfare impacts were assessed but not quantiï¬?ed&#13;
in monetary units; these along with other non-quantiï¬?ed impacts are listed in Annex Table A3.&#13;

              2.4 Impact mitigation&#13;
&#13;
              From a policy viewpoint, it is important to know how much of the estimated losses resulting from poor sanitation&#13;
              can be averted by implementing improved sanitation options. This study estimates the potential beneï¬?ts of the ï¬?ve&#13;
              features of sanitation improvements shown in Figure 4, plus improved sanitation for tourists, as shown in Table 3.&#13;
              Therefore the study provides an initial estimate of the likely gains from improving these features. These estimates&#13;
              are by nature fairly crude and generalized, and will be supplemented by more precise estimates of the full costs and&#13;
              beneï¬?ts of sanitation improvements from ï¬?eld settings in Indonesia, available from a forthcoming study.&#13;

                  3.1 Summary of economic impacts of poor sanitation&#13;
&#13;
                  The overall economic losses from poor sanitation and hygiene amount to IDR 56 trillion (USD 6.3 billion) per year&#13;
                  (see Table 4). This sum is equivalent to 2.3 % of GDP in 2005, amounting to approximately IDR 252,000 (USD 28.60)&#13;
                  per person per year. To give an indication of the relative impact on the Indonesian economy, where the average&#13;
                  price level is 36 percent of that of the United States (when prices are compared at market exchange rates), the&#13;
                  impact in international dollars is ID 17.8 billion.&#13;

By improving sanitation and hygiene, the majority of negative impacts can be averted (see Figure 6). Closer latrines&#13;
reduce time losses valued at IDR 10.6 trillion (USD 1.2 billion), while improved toilet systems and hygiene practices&#13;
bring health beneï¬?ts worth at least IDR 13.2 trillion (USD 1.5 billion). Water resource protection measures due to&#13;
improved management of human excreta also lead to potential savings of IDR 13.2 trillion (USD 1.5 billion), mainly&#13;
by reducing the costs associated with access to safe drinking water. Investment in improved sanitation and the re-&#13;
use of human excreta can lead to sanitation markets of at least IDR 5.3 trillion (USD 600 million) per annum. Improved&#13;
sanitation for tourist locations can lead to annual economic gains of at least IDR 1.5 trillion (USD 166 million).&#13;

                  In conclusion, protecting water resources, averting health impacts and reducing access time are the three major&#13;
                  potential beneï¬?ts of a sanitation program, as quantiï¬?ed in this study. Positive impacts on tourism, employment&#13;
                  from sanitation programs, and waste re-use are also potentially important beneï¬?ts from sanitation programs. Non-&#13;
                  quantiï¬?ed intangible beneï¬?ts such as comfort, privacy and security, especially for women and the elderly, are also&#13;
                  likely to bring major welfare improvements for populations receiving improved sanitation. However, further ï¬?eld&#13;
                  studies collecting primary information are needed to actually show these beneï¬?ts in an Indonesian context.&#13;

                  The ï¬?nancial and economic health costs assessed in this study include (1) spending on health care, (2) loss of income&#13;
                  or production associated with disease, and (3) the value associated with premature loss of life.&#13;

                                                                              hygiene, estimated using data from the national DHS,&#13;
                                                                              which collected diarrheal incidence rates for the under&#13;
                                                                              ï¬?ve population (2.5 cases per child per year). Twenty-&#13;
                  eight million cases of scabies are estimated to be attributed to poor hygiene practices. In addition, from the national&#13;
                  health information system, three million malnourished children, one million cases of helminthes, and a further one&#13;
                  million disease cases related to malnutrition, are attributed to poor sanitation and hygiene. However, these ï¬?gures&#13;
                  â&#128;&#147; especially those from routine government sources â&#128;&#147; are likely to be heavily underestimated, due to the majority of&#13;
                  disease cases not seeking health care from a public service provider in Indonesia. Other studies suggest signiï¬?cantly&#13;
                  higher rates of disease than those reported by government systems. For example, in East Asia helminthes are cited&#13;
                  to have prevalence rates of 36% (roundworm), 28% (whipworm) and 26% (hookworm)6, which would lead to&#13;
                  signiï¬?cantly more than one million cases. Three million malnourished children may also be a signiï¬?cant underestimate,&#13;
                  in a country where it is estimated that 28% of children under ï¬?ve â&#128;&#147; or 5.4 million â&#128;&#147; are severely or moderately&#13;
                  underweight.&#13;
&#13;
                  The total number of deaths attributed to poor sanitation and hygiene exceeds ï¬?fty thousand, of which 24,000 are&#13;
                  accounted for by direct diseases (mainly diarrhea) and 26,000 by indirect diseases related to malnutrition. These&#13;
                  latter deaths include only children under ï¬?ve and therefore underestimate the total deaths in all age groups.&#13;

3.2.2         Health care costs&#13;
&#13;
To estimate health care costs, the study compiled information on disease rates, treatment-seeking rates, treatment&#13;
practices, and unit costs. Disease incidence and treatment seeking rates were estimated for each province (see&#13;
Annex Tables C3 and C4). According to the national socio-economic survey (Susenas), two-thirds of Indonesians self&#13;
treat or take no treatment when sick, while the majority of those who seek care do so at a formal caregiver (Annex&#13;
Table B4). To estimate the costs of treatment seeking, standard health care unit costs were applied country-wide,&#13;
based on the available costing studies conducted in Indonesia (Annex Table B5). Table 6 shows the marginal and&#13;
full costs of treatment as well as the patient transport costs used in the study. For example, a diarrhea case seeking&#13;
outpatient care at a government or private formal facility would have a marginal cost of IDR 34,429, and including&#13;
ï¬?xed costs, the ï¬?gure would amount to IDR 48,554. In addition, transport costs would cost an average IDR 3,973 per&#13;
patient.&#13;

                                   A five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)     25&#13;
&amp;#12;RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  The total health care costs amount to IDR 1.6 trillion (USD 186 million), of which IDR 1.2 trillion (USD 140 million)&#13;
                  is direct marginal expenditure made by patients or the health facilities on medical care or transport. Diseases with&#13;
                  the greatest ï¬?nancial and economic impact are skin diseases (due to high treatment seeking), malnutrition (due to&#13;
                  higher unit costs) and diarrheal disease (due to high numbers). Public clinics account for 49% of economic cost, or&#13;
                  IDR 803 billion (USD 91 million), followed by private clinics at 36%, self-treatment at 10% and transport costs at 5%.&#13;
                  Hence a signiï¬?cant proportion of the economic costs would be saved to patients and to government budgets if&#13;
                  sanitation and hygiene-related diseases were prevented.&#13;

                  3.2.3 Health-related productivity costs&#13;
&#13;
                  Disease takes people away from their occupations and daily activities, and regular sickness-related absence from&#13;
                  school aï¬&#128;ects the ability of children to keep up with the curriculum and complete their education. Hence the time&#13;
                  lost from these activities has a value. Financial costs were estimated as immediate income losses for adults not paid&#13;
                  their wage or earning an income from time lost due to sickness7. Economic costs were estimated as the time lost&#13;
                  from daily activities, valued for adults at 30% of the average compensation to employees of IDR 12,183 (USD 1.38)&#13;
                  per hour, giving IDR 3,655 (USD 0.41) as the national average value of lost time (see Annex Table C5 for provincial&#13;
                  values8, as well as other sources of time value including GDP per capita, minimum wage and average wage). Child&#13;
                  time was valued at half that of adult time at IDR 1,827 (USD 0.21) â&#128;&#147; to account for the time taken oï¬&#128; school or other&#13;
                  productive activities. Time oï¬&#128; daily activities varied from two to ten days depending on the severity of the disease,&#13;
                  and whether treated or not.&#13;
&#13;
                  Table 8 shows total productivity losses of roughly IDR 3 trillion (USD 350 million) per annum, two-thirds of which is&#13;
                  accounted for by adults. Eighty-four percent of economic costs are accounted for by diarrheal diseases, and 65%&#13;
                  represent losses to the adult population. Financial costs associated with income loss for adults are in the order of IDR&#13;
                  1 trillion (USD 117 million) per annum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  7      In 2005, 61% of all adults aged over 15 were in some kind of employment: salaried position (27%), self employed without employees (18%),&#13;
                        self employed with employees (25%), casual workers (10%), and unpaid workers (20%).&#13;
                  8     Compensation of employees per capita was calculated at provincial level by multiplying national compensation of employees by the ratio of&#13;
                        GDP per capita at the provincial to national GDP per capita, and dividing by the total full-time equivalent workforce.&#13;

3.2.4 Costs of premature death&#13;
&#13;
Premature death aï¬&#128;ects society in a number of ways. The most tangible economic impact is the loss of a member&#13;
of the workforce, which has implications for economic outputs and wages generated now and in the future. One&#13;
method used in cost-beneï¬?t analysis is to approximate the value of human life using the estimated future discounted&#13;
income stream from a productive person, termed the â&#128;&#152;human capital approachâ&#128;&#153;. Given that this technique gives more&#13;
conservative (lower) estimates of the value of human life compared with alternative methods commonly applied,&#13;
such as value-of-a-statistical-life (VOSL), the human capital approach was used in this study. As an approximate&#13;
average wage, or value of time, the average annual compensation to employees of IDR 24.5 million (USD 2,775) was&#13;
applied. This gives an equivalent value of life of IDR 540 million (USD 61,278) for those dying as productive adults&#13;
(those over 15 years of age, with a median age of 40 years old); IDR 1 billion (USD 115,387) for those dying between&#13;
the ages of 5 and 14 (median age of 10 years old); and IDR 860 million (USD 97,760) for the death of a child under&#13;
ï¬?ve (median age of 2.5 years old).&#13;
&#13;
These values reï¬&#130;ect an economic cost for a premature death. To estimate the ï¬?nancial cost of premature death â&#128;&#147; to&#13;
reï¬&#130;ect short-term direct income loss â&#128;&#147; it is conservatively assumed that a household loses the equivalent of one year&#13;
of income, or IDR 24.5 million (USD 2,775). These ï¬?gures all reï¬&#130;ect national average. Provincial value of life ï¬?gures are&#13;
provided in Annex Table C6. In sensitivity analysis, the VOSL method is used. Due to the absence of studies on VOSL&#13;
in Indonesia, an average VOSL of USD 2 million is transferred from OECD country studies. The transfer is made at an&#13;
income elasticity of 0.6, and adjusted by the diï¬&#128;erence in GDP per capita between these countries and Indonesia.&#13;
The resulting economic value for premature death valued using VOSL is IDR 2.1 billion (USD 240,341).&#13;
&#13;
Table 9 presents the total costs of premature death. Of a total economic cost of IDR 25 trillion, the majority (95%) is&#13;
attributed to deaths in the 0-4 year old age group â&#128;&#147; but this proportion is higher because deaths in this age group&#13;
have been more comprehensively assessed. Financial costs total IDR 440 billion (USD 50 million). Economic and&#13;
ï¬?nancial costs would be higher if the â&#128;&#152;otherâ&#128;&#153; category of indirect deaths had been included (see footnote to Table&#13;
5).&#13;

&#13;
3.3 Water resource impacts&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia is well-endowed with water resources, with an average surface water volume of 15,500 m3 per person per&#13;
year. Major rivers include the Kali Brantas and Bengawan Solo rivers in East Java, the Cenranae river in South Sulawesi,&#13;
and the Barito river in Central Kalimantan (see Annex Table C7). Major lakes include Air Siku and Kolong Kac in South&#13;
Sumatra and Palaguna lake in South Sulawesi (see Annex Table C8). However, water availability is highly variable&#13;
between regions and seasons, with some rivers drying up during the dry season. On Java, the average available&#13;
surface water is one tenth the national average due to high population density.&#13;
&#13;
The impact of pollution on the economic value of water resources is determined by three main factors: the extent&#13;
of water resources, the release of polluting substances in water resources, and the actual or potential uses of water.&#13;
At the national level, currently about 93% of freshwater resources are withdrawn for irrigation, 6% for domestic&#13;
activities and 1% for industrial use9. For some of these activities, such as for drinking, good quality water is important;&#13;
while for other uses, such as for agricultural and some industrial uses, water quality standards are not so strict.&#13;
&#13;
3.3.1 Water pollution from poor sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Domestic sources contribute signiï¬?cantly to water pollution in Indonesia, where the majority of households do not&#13;
have sewage or wastewater safely disposed of or treated. However, the presence of other sources of water pollution&#13;
means that overall economic impact of polluted water cannot be attributed to poor sanitation alone. Pollutants that&#13;
aï¬&#128;ect water-related economic activity originate from households, industry, agriculture (fertilizers, pesticides, animal&#13;
waste), erosion, and salinity intrusion from coastal areas.&#13;
&#13;
Water pollution from domestic sources can be estimated from the annual release or eventual seepage of untreated&#13;
feces, urine, and gray water into inland water bodies. Table 10 shows the proportion of the total population with&#13;
sanitation options that discharge directly or indirectly to ground or surface water. The total eï¬&#132;uent of human excreta&#13;
to water bodies is then estimated by combining population size by province (Annex Table C1), access to diï¬&#128;erent&#13;
types of sanitation facilities (Annex Table C2), the proportion of sewage released into water bodies (Table 10, or&#13;
Annex Table C9 for provincial breakdown), and average human waste production per year10.&#13;

Based on the above data and assumptions, the total release of polluting substances to inland water bodies in&#13;
Indonesia is estimated at 6.4 million tones of feces annually, 64 million m3 of urine, and 854 million m3 of gray water&#13;
(Table 11). This translates as approximately 2.1 million tones of biochemical oxygen demand and 385,000 tons of&#13;
nitrogen compounds per year. A provincial distribution is shown in Annex Table C10. In Jakarta alone, roughly 0.3&#13;
million tons of feces and 2 million m3 of urine are estimated to be released in into inland water bodies.&#13;

                  Other sources of water pollution are industrial and agricultural activities. However as with domestic wastes, there&#13;
                  is no existing national level estimate. Based on authorsâ&#128;&#153; estimates using available studies on industrial waste in&#13;
                  Jakarta (Annex Table C11), approximations of animal waste, and other studies from the Asia region, the proportion&#13;
                  of biochemical oxygen demand from domestic, agricultural and industrial sources is estimated (Annex Table C12).&#13;
                  Nationally, an estimated 35% of BOD is released from domestic sources (varying 3% to 69% across provinces),&#13;
                  compared with 57% from industry and 9% from agriculture. There is a wide variation in these estimates at the&#13;
                  provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
                  3.3.2 Water quality indicators&#13;
&#13;
                  Water quality monitoring in Indonesia is mainly conducted by the government, at national, provincial and local levels.&#13;
                  Some major government monitoring activities include (1) the Clean River Program (PROKASIH), which measures&#13;
                  water quality in the most heavily polluted rivers, including industrial wastewater discharge; (2) the Clean City Award&#13;
                  Program (ADIPURA), which includes water quality as one of the evaluated categories; and (3) a national government-&#13;
                  supported program monitoring one river in each province since 2002. The Ministry of Environment compiles river&#13;
                  water monitoring results from several provinces and publishes them in the annual â&#128;&#152;State of the Environmentâ&#128;&#153; report.&#13;
                  Selected river quality indicators from this report are presented in Annex Table C13. In addition to government&#13;
                  activities, water companies also conduct water quality monitoring on their sources of water supply.&#13;
&#13;
                  Diï¬&#128;erent organizations measure diï¬&#128;erent water quality indicators. Parameters routinely recorded are temperature, pH,&#13;
                  conductivity, turbidity, biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen and nutrients (ammonia and orthophosphate).&#13;
                  Indicator monitoring is done mainly for regulatory enforcement at the provincial level. More recently, the general&#13;
                  public has been able to access several indicators updated daily via the website of the river management agency.&#13;
                  Although monitoring is conducted at many sites throughout the country, results are not widely disseminated and&#13;
                  the available data are indicative (e.g. the low and high values) rather than complete. Second, when interpreting the&#13;
                  results it should be borne in mind that the water quality monitoring schedule is somewhat erratic and produces&#13;
                  some results which do not appear robust when cross-temporal or cross-site comparisons are made.&#13;
&#13;
                  Table 12 presents a summary of the pollution levels of selected rivers. Annex Table C13 provides the data supporting&#13;
                  these assessments, covering pH, dissolved oxygen, BOD, dissolved solids, and suspended solids. Given the large&#13;
                  volumes of pollution load presented in section 3.3.1, it is not surprising that the quality of river water is poor. Most&#13;
                  BOD readings are above the national standard of 2 mg/l, while at downstream locations dissolved oxygen levels&#13;
                  are routinely below 5 mg/l (an approximate threshold below which compromises the ability of water to support&#13;
                  ï¬?sh). For 30 provinces, all rivers at some time do not fulï¬?ll the Class I quality standard as a source of raw water for&#13;
                  drinking. In 2005 only three rivers fulï¬?lled the Class I criteria at locations upstream. Similarly, for locations mid- and&#13;
                  downstream, only three rivers were able, at a speciï¬?c point in time (not all the time), to fulï¬?ll the Class II criteria (water&#13;
                  quality suitable for other uses such as recreation and ï¬?sh farming/aquaculture). Even rivers in low density areas such&#13;
                  as Papua have mildly polluted water and do not meet the required drinking water standard.&#13;

  Water quality evaluated based on Government Regulation No 82/2001 on Water Quality Management and Water Pollution Control. Upstream&#13;
river quality evaluated based on Class I criteria (suitability as source of raw drinking water); mid- and downstream quality based on Class II&#13;
criteria (suitability for water-based recreation activities, aquaculture, husbandry, plant watering and other uses).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is noteworthy that while rivers may exhibit a higher capacity to assimilate waste during the rainy season, water&#13;
quality indicators are not necessarily better. For example, monitoring at the Brantas River Basin in East Java showed&#13;
that during the rainy season, suspended solid loads rise to 70-500 mg/l compared to 20-150 mg/l in dry season,&#13;
above the Indonesian standard of 50 mg/l. Furthermore, BOD at Brantas river ranges from 5-12 mg/l during the dry&#13;
season, and from 6-15 mg/l during the wet season, which is signiï¬?cantly higher than the Indonesian standard of 2&#13;
mg/l. One of the most polluted river sections exhibited BOD values ranging from 10 to 20 mg/l .&#13;

&#13;
                  Due to the many pollutants released into water in Indonesia, leading to poor quality surface water, few surface water&#13;
                  sources are safe to drink from. This leads to households switching to water sources that are less convenient to access,&#13;
                  more costly to access, or less safe, or all three. Annex Table B7 shows selected drinking water quality standards in&#13;
                  Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
                  As a consequence of poor quality surface water or, equally, concerns about the quality of groundwater, many&#13;
                  households in Indonesia choose to consume treated water from water treatment plants (18%), bottled water (4%),&#13;
                  and/or they treat water themselves (at least 7 in 10 households). Many households have little choice but to continue&#13;
                  to consume unsafe water, such as from an unprotected well or spring (14%), or surface water such as rivers (3%).&#13;

                  In 2006, 39% of urban households and 23% of rural households obtained their drinking water from a source that is&#13;
                  located less than 10 meters from the nearest septic tank or other waste disposal site, where the risk of contamination&#13;
                  is relatively high. In Jakarta, more than 60% of wells sampled in 2004 were contaminated with E. coli in excess of&#13;
                  the regulated drinking water level, despite the majority of these being classiï¬?ed as protected wells. Furthermore,&#13;
                  in 2006 the Jakarta Environmental Monitoring Agency (BPLHD Jakarta) estimated that 80% of deep wells were&#13;
                  contaminated with E. coli. Hence the actual access to improved drinking water sources may be diï¬&#128;erent from the&#13;
                  estimates provided in Table 13.&#13;
&#13;
                  Table 14 shows the proportion of households that pay for their drinking water compared with those that obtain their&#13;
                  drinking water free of charge, by water source. According to the Susenas survey, 78% of households obtain their&#13;
                  water nominally free of charge; but in fact there may be capital, maintenance or access costs (especially for piped&#13;

Due to lack of nationally representative data on the proportion of households that treat their drinking water&#13;
themselves, available local studies and interviews were used. The study assumes that 90% of all households treat&#13;
their water, where their main drinking water source is not package/bottled water. In the less-developed and poorer&#13;
provinces of West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, West Papua and Papua, it is assumed that 70% of households&#13;
treat their drinking water. The majority â&#128;&#147; over 95% â&#128;&#147; of household treatment, is done by boiling, as shown in a 6-&#13;
province study.&#13;
&#13;
Unit cost information for various water sources was gathered from several sources:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Water piped from treatment plant: the average price for non-commercial customers in 2004 was IDR 1,500 (USD&#13;
     0.17) per m3, varying by province from IDR 700 (USD 0.08) per m3 to IDR 2,400 (USD 0.27) per m3, inï¬&#130;ated to&#13;
     reï¬&#130;ect 2006 prices. Financial cost was estimated to be 80% of economic cost, given that water companies are&#13;
     subsidized (80% reï¬&#130;ects the average level of cost recovery for water companies).&#13;
â&#128;¢ Water piped from other sources: assumed to cost IDR 21,200 (USD 2.4) per m3. Financial cost equals economic&#13;
     cost. It is assumed that households choose piped water for two reasons: quality concerns and convenience.&#13;
     Quality concerns (related to poor sanitation) are attributed 50% of the piped water costs.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Other purchased water: IDR 47,700 (USD 5.4) per m3 from water vendors selling by the jerry can, and IDR 326,600&#13;
     (USD 37) per m3 for packaged water based on an average of small sized bottled water and reï¬?llable 19-liter&#13;
     containers (locally called a â&#128;&#152;galonâ&#128;&#153;). Financial cost is equal to economic cost.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Cost of household water treatment (boiling): the study uses an economic cost of IDR 2,000 (USD 0.21) to boil&#13;
     a liter of water, representing a weighted average of the economic cost of kerosene11 and an opportunity cost&#13;
     for ï¬?rewood collection (the two main fuel sources for boiling water). The ï¬?nancial cost is calculated using the&#13;
     subsidized kerosene prices, which reï¬&#130;ects the amount households actually pay12.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Hauled water: nationally, 64% of households hauling their water require 5 minutes or less daily to obtain their&#13;
     water; 29% require 5-29 minutes; 5% require 30-59 minutes, and 3% require more than one hour. Part of the&#13;
     time costs, valued at average compensation to employees, are allocated to poor water quality, as households&#13;
     have to travel further to access adequately clean water. This is only an economic cost, with no ï¬?nancial cost.&#13;
&#13;
11 The ï¬?nancial cost of boiling water using kerosene (Action research on point of use drinking water treatment alternatives as appropriate for&#13;
   underprivileged households in Jakarta. M Weimer. Environmental Services Program: Jakarta. 2006) was adjusted by the government subsidy&#13;
   on kerosene to estimate the full economic cost.&#13;
12 The subsidy provided by the government is not included as ï¬?nancial cost given that the costs are not a direct ï¬?nancial contribution by the&#13;
   government, but rather the lower sales volume of oil on the international market.&#13;

                  The total costs of accessing cleaner drinking water due to water pollution are adjusted to reï¬&#130;ect the contribution of&#13;
                  poor sanitation to overall water pollution, using the proportions by province shown in Annex Table C14.&#13;
&#13;
                  Table 15 shows the total costs attributed to poor sanitation of accessing drinking water, including only the daily needs&#13;
                  per capita for drinking water. The largest cost component is for drinking water treatment, since most Indonesians&#13;
                  boil their water (even piped water from formal treatment plants are not directly potable). The ï¬?nancial cost is IDR&#13;
                  7.1 trillion (USD 803 million) per year, while the economic cost is IDR 12 trillion (USD 1,364) per year. The majority of&#13;
                  costs â&#128;&#147; 85% â&#128;&#147; are attributed to household water treatment. Since most households use kerosene as cooking fuel, the&#13;
                  economic cost is higher than the ï¬?nancial cost to households because the price of kerosene is heavily subsidized&#13;
                  by the government.&#13;

                  3.3.4         Other domestic uses of water&#13;
                  In addition to the uses of surface and groundwater sources for drinking, water is a resource for many other human&#13;
                  and nonhuman activities. While it is not possible to conduct an exhaustive analysis of all the uses of water, this study&#13;
                  assessed the relevance of non-commercial household (domestic) activities, such as the use of water for cooking,&#13;
                  washing, and bathing.&#13;
&#13;
                  Table 16 shows the costs attributed to poor sanitation as a result of accessing water from improved water sources.&#13;
                  The estimated economic impact amounts to IDR 1.2 trillion (USD 131 million) per year. Nearly 90% of these costs are&#13;
                  accounted for by households that purchase piped water. Although the same strict requirements for water quality do&#13;
                  not apply as for drinking water, households may still walk further for improved water and willingly pay companies to&#13;
                  deliver or pipe water for non-drinking domestic uses.&#13;

3.3.5     Fish production&#13;
&#13;
The ï¬?sheries sub-sector in Indonesia employs more than 4.5 million people (4.7% of the workforce) in both wild&#13;
capture ï¬?sheries and aquaculture. In 2005, ï¬?sheries contributed USD 6.8 billion to the national product, equivalent&#13;
to 2.2% of GDP. In 2005, fresh ï¬?sh and shrimp exports totaled USD 1.5 billion, or about 2% of all exports .&#13;
&#13;
Given the lack of empirical evidence linking water quality and ï¬?sh production in Southeast Asia, this study used&#13;
innovative methods to examine the likely eï¬&#128;ect of sewage on ï¬?sh production. While the impact of micro-bacteria in&#13;
surface water aï¬&#128;ects both ï¬?sh health and the health of the Indonesian people who live oï¬&#128; ï¬?sh, the lack of data on&#13;
these makes it diï¬&#131;cult to evaluate quantitatively. A second link is examined, which is the impact of BOD from sewage&#13;
and wastewater on dissolved oxygen levels in rivers, lakes and ponds and hence ï¬?sh reproduction and survival. The&#13;
methodology used is described in full in the 4-country regional report (see Acknowledgments for citation).&#13;
&#13;
It is estimated that the negative impact of poor sanitation on the dissolved oxygen content of freshwater in Indonesia&#13;
causes a loss to ï¬?sh production equivalent to IDR 812 billion (USD 92 million) per annum, of which 17% is accounted&#13;
for by South Sumatra, 15% by West Kalimantan and 12% by South Kalimantan (Annex Table C15 provides the full&#13;
provincial breakdown).&#13;
&#13;
3.3.6     Summary of water-related costs&#13;
&#13;
Table 21 shows the total costs from the three evaluated impacts of water pollution in Indonesia. The majority of&#13;
ï¬?nancial and economic losses â&#128;&#147; over 85% â&#128;&#147; are accounted for by drinking water quality impact. Fifty-eight percent&#13;
of the costs are accounted for by rural areas and 42% by urban areas. These costs are an underestimate of the total&#13;
water-related costs of poor sanitation, as a number of other potential impacts were not evaluated (see Annex Table&#13;
B2).&#13;

&#13;
                  Aesthetics is not strongly related to productivity or income. Economic studies do not usually quantify aesthetics,&#13;
                  such as smell and sight, in economic terms. Studies assessing user preferences for sanitation options, including&#13;
                  willingness to pay studies, tend to limit the focus to the physical boundaries of the household, and hence not the&#13;
                  broader environment where people spend their time, such as rural paths and roads, city streets, market places,&#13;
                  ï¬?elds, and so on. In Indonesia, the housing module in Susenas collects information on the type of environmental&#13;
                  pollution suï¬&#128;ered by households, covering diï¬&#128;erent sources of smoke, odor and noise. The Susenas 2004 survey&#13;
                  found that more than 10 million people are exposed to open sewers, more than 43 million people exposed to open&#13;
                  defecation, and more than 8 million people exposed to open dumping of solid waste (Table 18). Although diï¬&#131;cult&#13;
                  to quantify in monetary terms, the impact of exposure to sub-standard practices of waste disposal may impact&#13;
                  directly on consumption and production activities of households, yielding lower level of welfare and quality of life.&#13;
                  The real condition of reduced quality of life can be reï¬&#130;ected by one example, where in 2005 residents living close&#13;
                  to an open dumping site Bantargebang in Bekasi were awarded IDR 50,000 (USD 5.70) per month per household as&#13;
                  compensation for the smell they have to endure (â&#128;&#152;smell compensationâ&#128;&#153;) .&#13;

3.4.2 Land quality&#13;
&#13;
Land that is used for improper, unoï¬&#131;cial disposal of solid waste and open defecation will be unusable for other more&#13;
productive uses, and hence will cause an economic loss to society. Collection rates of solid waste are low, especially&#13;
in poor urban and rural areas in Indonesia. Even when collected, about 90% of the waste is disposed of illegally,&#13;
through open dumping practices without proper environmental considerations. The majority of cities (85 small&#13;
cities and 53% of medium-sized cities) implement open dumping; only a small proportion of solid waste is recycled&#13;
or properly disposed in controlled dumping sites or sanitary landï¬?lls. Hence the price of land close to solid waste&#13;
disposal areas can be highly depressed, as in the case of Bantargebang in the city of Bekasi, Banten Province, where&#13;
the average price of land close to the disposal site (IDR 20,000 to IDR 30,000 per m2) was about 10% of the average&#13;
price in northern Bekasi (IDR 300,000 per m2).&#13;
&#13;
Table 17 shows that the total economic loss is estimated at IDR 245 billion (USD 27.8 million) due to open defecation&#13;
practices, and IDR 604 billion (USD 68.5 million) due to poor solid waste disposal practices (see Annex Table C17 for&#13;
provincial and rural/urban breakdown).&#13;

3.5 Other welfare impacts&#13;
&#13;
Diï¬&#131;culties in quantiï¬?cation aside, no studies at the national level provide information on what is classiï¬?ed in the&#13;
present study as â&#128;&#156;other welfareâ&#128;? impacts of poor sanitation. The type of sanitation facility a household has will have&#13;
a range of impacts on population welfare. An important but diï¬&#131;cult to quantify aspect is the welfare impact on&#13;
individuals and families that use a sub-standard, uncomfortable latrine or have no latrine at all. Except for the disease&#13;
impact (covered elsewhere), these less tangible aspects of human welfare have limited direct ï¬?nancial implications,&#13;
but can be quantiï¬?ed as welfare losses using conventional economic techniques. More tangible impacts of using&#13;
sub-standard latrines or having no facilities are time impacts due to journeying time or waiting due to insuï¬&#131;cient&#13;
shared or public latrines per head of population, as well as life decisions such as schooling or choice of employment,&#13;
which may be linked to the presence of sub-standard latrines or absence of latrines in schools and workplaces.&#13;
&#13;
3.5.1 Access time&#13;
&#13;
Welfare loss from increased access time arising from having to use unimproved sanitation can be due to journey&#13;
time for open defecation or waiting time for shared latrines. Table 20 presents the population experiencing sub-&#13;
optimal access (Annex Table C19 presents the provincial and rural/urban breakdown). For 75% of households,&#13;
comprising households using private toilets, and a proportion of those using shared and common latrines (50%)&#13;
and those practicing open defecation (25%), access time is already minimized. The remaining population â&#128;&#147; 10%&#13;
using shared and 15% practicing open defecation, equaling 25% of households â&#128;&#147; are assumed to experience sub-&#13;
optimal access time. For these households, open defecation is assumed to require 15 minutes per day extra to ï¬?nd&#13;
a secluded spot for defecation, while for shared latrines the extra time queuing varies from 15 minutes in rural areas&#13;
to 30 minutes in urban areas. Access time is relatively high because in urban areas in Indonesia access time can be&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                               Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Indonesia&#13;
                               A five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)     37&#13;
&amp;#12;RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  longer because toilets are shared with many people, and because it is common for people to wash themselves while&#13;
                  in the latrines, thus prolonging queuing time. For example, in the public toilets being built by BEST in urban areas of&#13;
                  Banten Province, the 6-7 latrines are shared by 100 families. Assuming 4 people per family, that makes a ratio of 57&#13;
                  people per latrine. In other towns, dormitories catering to blue collar workers were found to provide only 2 latrines&#13;
                  for 20-40 people, who often have to queue for more than half an hour to use the latrine. Hence, queuing is one of&#13;
                  the main complaints regarding shared public latrines.&#13;
&#13;
                  The economic losses were computed on the basis of forgone income. In the case of adults, this was assumed to be&#13;
                  30% of the average daily compensation of employees. The time value of children was assumed to be half the value&#13;
                  of adult time.&#13;

                  Latrine access time also makes up an important component of the cost of unimproved sanitation. Fifty-ï¬?ve million&#13;
                  people experience sub-standard access time daily, with more than 4 billion hours of access time needed annually&#13;
                  (Table 21). Annual economic losses are estimated at IDR 10.8 trillion, or USD 1.22 billion (Annex Table C19 presents&#13;

                  poor sanitation could provide important arguments for sanitation programs. However, to date no studies examining&#13;
                  these aspects in Indonesia have come to light.&#13;
                      â&#128;¢ Comfort &amp; acceptabilityâ&#128;&#147; the ease to perform personal hygiene functions; the freedom from rushing to&#13;

                      â&#128;¢ Privacy and convenience â&#128;&#147; the beneï¬?ts of not being seen using the toilet; not being limited to toilet-going&#13;
                           in the hours of darkness; or being seen walking to access toilet facilities, especially women.&#13;
                      â&#128;¢ Security â&#128;&#147; the location of the latrine within or near to the home means that excursions to the outdoors&#13;
                           do not need to be made for toilet-going needs, in particular at night, when there may be dangers (theft,&#13;
                           attack, rape, and injuries sustained from snakes or other dangerous animals).&#13;

latrines are unhygienic, poorly maintained, and do not cater to the special needs of women. The presence of hygienic&#13;
and private sanitation facilities in schools has been shown to aï¬&#128;ect enrollment and attendance, especially for girls.&#13;
Good latrine access at the workplace has implications for female participation in traditionally male-dominated&#13;
employment areas. Furthermore, sanitary and adequate latrines in schools and at workplaces not only aï¬&#128;ect&#13;
participation rates but improve the welfare of all pupils and employees using them.&#13;
&#13;
Given the complex web of causative factors and eventual life decisions, and the many factors determining&#13;
absenteeism from school or the workplace, it is diï¬&#131;cult to quantify the exact relationship between poor sanitation&#13;
conditions, education and work decisions, and eventual economic outcomes. In terms of education, the poor quality&#13;
of education is still a challenge, including poor quality of infrastructure. Oï¬&#131;cial reports have in recent years provided&#13;
snapshots of the condition of classrooms and other school facilities in Indonesia (Figure 9). Available data suggest&#13;
that a signiï¬?cant number of kindergarten and primary classrooms are not in an acceptable condition (&gt;35%), while&#13;
a lower proportion of secondary school classrooms are in a damaged state (&lt;20%). At the primary school level,&#13;
less than half of all classrooms are in satisfactory condition, and about a quarter are badly damaged. If classrooms&#13;
are damaged, it is probable that water and sanitation facilities at these schools are in a similar or worse condition.&#13;
Indeed, it is highly likely that the toilet condition in the majority of schools is signiï¬?cantly worse than the classroom&#13;
condition.&#13;

                                                      A five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)     39&#13;
&amp;#12;RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  There are no data on toilet or clean water access at schools in Indonesia. Some anecdotal information is available,&#13;
                  such as the report of consultants on the Indonesia School Improvement Grants Program (SIGP) who, visiting potential&#13;
                  grantee schools in Pandeglang (West Java), observed that in almost all schools, toilets and washrooms were out of&#13;
                  order. Those which were still working were inadequate in number to cater for the number of students using them.&#13;
                  On average there were 2 toilets per school. Lack of clean water access was also observed, with students at many&#13;
                  schools being forced to use streams or ï¬?sh ponds near the school for toilet needs, posing particular problems during&#13;
                  the rainy season.&#13;
&#13;
                  In spite of poor classroom conditions, however, oï¬&#131;cial statistics show primary school enrollment rates in Indonesia&#13;
                  to be relatively high, with no diï¬&#128;erence in enrollment between boys and girls (93% for both girls and boys in 2005).&#13;
                  A higher proportion of boys complete primary school, however, and there is higher drop out rate for girls than for&#13;
                  boys. On the other hand, despite relatively better quality of classrooms and facilities, enrolment rates at junior (65%)&#13;
                  and senior secondary (42%) school are signiï¬?cantly lower than at primary school. This drop-out can be attributed&#13;
                  to various contributing factors; but note that, at these older ages, toilet availability and condition become relatively&#13;
                  more important for children, especially girls.&#13;
&#13;
                  A survey in 1999 indicated sickness, having to work/earn money, having to help with household chores, and having&#13;
                  been punished as the main reasons for missing schools days. The reasons for dropping out or not attending school&#13;
                  include parentsâ&#128;&#153; low income, student laziness, having to work, having had enough education, and the school being&#13;
                  too far away. The condition of school facilities was not cited among the main reasons for missing school days or&#13;
                  dropping out of school, although poor water and sanitation is unlikely to have been provided as a response option&#13;
                  in school surveys.&#13;
&#13;
                  Lack of data is also encountered in terms of work participation, and this study did not explore this issue further.&#13;
&#13;
                  3.6 Tourism impacts&#13;
&#13;
                  Tourism is a key sector in Indonesia, providing IDR 39.7 trillion (USD 4.5 billion) in revenue in 2006, an important&#13;
                  source of local government tax income, as well as jobs for 6.1 million Indonesians (7% of total jobs). In 2006, almost&#13;
                  5 million foreign visitors traveled to Indonesia, 57% for holidays, 38% for business, and 5% for other purposes. The&#13;
                  tourist industry is expected to grow by 3.6% in 2007, increasing to 6.4% per annum from 2008 to 2015.&#13;
&#13;
                  The number of tourists choosing Indonesia for their holidays is related, among other things, to the general sanitary&#13;
                  conditions of the country, such as the quality of water resources; quality of outdoor environment (smell, sightliness);&#13;
                  food safety (hygiene in food preparation); general availability of toilets oï¬&#128;ering comfort and privacy in hotels,&#13;
                  restaurants, and bus stations; and the related health risks of all the above. Better sanitary conditions will attract&#13;
                  â&#128;&#152;high-valueâ&#128;&#153; tourists, that is, those who are willing to pay more for their holiday. Currently, foreign tourists spend on&#13;
                  average IDR 882,800 (USD 100) per day, and stay on average 9 days, giving an average revenue per tourist visit of IDR&#13;
                  7.9 million (USD 900).&#13;
&#13;
                  Economic losses are reï¬&#130;ected by the gap between current tourist revenues and the tourist revenues that would&#13;
                  be possible at signiï¬?cantly higher tourist visit numbers, such as those experienced by neighboring countries with&#13;
                  higher visit rates. The current hotel occupancy rate of 45% is low, and is assumed, therefore, in the mid-term, to grow&#13;
                  to 80%. The analysis conservatively assumes constant hotel capacity over the same time period. Assuming that 5%&#13;
                  of these revenue gains are attributable to improved sanitation, present poor sanitation conditions are estimated to&#13;
                  contribute IDR 1,465 billion (USD 166 million) in losses annually (Annex Table C20 provides provincial breakdown).&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                                          RESULTS&#13;

3.7 Sanitation Markets&#13;
&#13;
In addition to averted losses, improved sanitation and hygiene means a shift in demand for hygiene-related products&#13;
such as latrines, soap and toilet paper. Improved toilet systems leads to an increase in demand for construction&#13;
materials, and improved treatment and disposal leads to increased demand for sludge removal services.&#13;
&#13;
Table 22 shows the potential market size for sanitation inputs for the construction of latrines. The analysis assumes&#13;
sanitation improvement in some 2.1 million rural households and 170,000 urban households annually to meet the&#13;
MDG target in 2015, with the majority constructing latrines with septic tanks (soak pits). Using these assumptions,&#13;
the value of demand for materials is worth at least IDR 2.4 trillion (USD 274 million) annually.&#13;

Improvement in hygiene means an increase in the use of hygienic products, including soap and toilet paper. An&#13;
increase of 40% in the use of soap by rural households and 20% by urban households results in an increase in&#13;
demand for soap worth IDR 630 billion (USD 71 million) annually (Table 23). A 25% increase in households using&#13;
toilet paper could yield an additional IDR 313 billion (USD 24 million) demand for toilet paper annually. Proper&#13;
handling of pits and septic tanks requires sludge to be removed at least every two years; leading to market growth&#13;
of IDR 2 trillion (USD 227 million) per year in sludge removal services.&#13;

In addition to expanding the market for sanitation inputs, improved sanitation includes re-use of waste. The reuse of&#13;
human waste for fertilizer or biogas production cannot be assumed to be population-wide, given cultural attitudes&#13;
towards handling and re-use of human waste, and low practical feasibility in many locations. Success often depends&#13;
on local perceptions of the expected returns on re-using of human waste, whether it be for biogas or fertilizer. The&#13;

                  number of establishments or households using human fecal waste for fertilizer is not yet signiï¬?cant in Indonesia.&#13;
                  Fecal waste processing has so far largely focused on using animal waste, with the Ministry of Agriculture promoting&#13;
                  small-scale biogas processing. The Ministry of Agriculture has estimated that a biogas digester using excreta from&#13;
                  livestock can yield the equivalent of 2.5 liters of kerosene per day, valued at USD 1.42 per day or USD 517 annually.&#13;

                                                                             Some of these facilities are ï¬?tted with a system for&#13;

                                                                             100 households can generate enough biogas to power 3&#13;
                                                                             stoves for 24 hours. The stoves are located on site; some&#13;
                                                                             are used by households for daily cooking, and some are&#13;
                                                                             allotted to small scale food vendors. Based on these&#13;
                                                                             parameters, this study conservatively estimates that each&#13;
                                                                             stove runs continuously for 12 hours per day, and that&#13;
                                                                             each hour of cooking is equivalent to the use of one liter&#13;
                                                                             of kerosene at the cost of IDR 5,000 (USD 0.57). In total,&#13;
                  each stove can yield USD 6.80 worth of cooking energy per day per stove, or IDR 68 million (USD 7,442) per year for&#13;
                  three stoves. If we assume that all households sharing the sanitation facilities have equal access to the stoves, the&#13;
                  estimated beneï¬?t for 100 households is IDR 650,000 (USD 74) annually per household. Assuming 198,000 rural&#13;
                  households and 710,000 urban households adopt biogas, the potential value of waste conversion into biogas is at&#13;
                  least IDR 132 billion (USD 15 million) per year in rural areas and IDR 467 billion (USD 53 million) in urban areas,&#13;
                  totaling IDR 600 billion (USD 67 million) annually.&#13;

                                                                                                      investments in sanitation and hygiene promotion&#13;

                                                                                                      in this study, as well as generating further beneï¬?ts&#13;
                                                                                                      through excreta re-use and sanitation input market value.&#13;
                                                                                                      Improving sanitation also contributes to the attainment&#13;
                                                                                                      of other development targets, including some of the&#13;
                                                                                                      key MDGs. With at least one third of the Indonesian&#13;
                                                                                                      households without improved sanitation, it is evident&#13;
                                                                                                      that more investments are needed in this sector.&#13;
&#13;
              Recommendation 2. Target investments to rural areas as well as to urban slums&#13;
              Losses are incurred in both rural and urban populations where sanitation is unimproved, thus justifying balanced&#13;
              investment to both unserved rural and urban areas, and targeting of subsidies to the most deserving populations.&#13;
&#13;
              Per capita losses were marginally higher in urban areas, while a larger proportion of the unserved population resides&#13;
              in rural areas. Sanitation programs should in particular target families with young children, as this population group&#13;
              is more vulnerable to health impacts of unimproved sanitation. Rural areas where households practice subsistence&#13;
              farming and have limited cash income and spending power will need motivation to reach the ï¬?rst rung of the&#13;
              sanitation ladder.&#13;
&#13;
              Another priority is supporting sanitation development in poor urban areas where land or house ownership is low&#13;
              and households cannot easily improve sanitation individually but need a community response. These areas have&#13;
              high population densities and are more exposed to the negative impacts of poor sanitation. In such conï¬?ned spaces,&#13;
              human excreta that is not properly disposed or treated will pollute water resources, drains, rivers and canals and&#13;
              increase health risks among the people living in the vicinity.&#13;
&#13;
              Recommendation 3. Strengthen promotion and information campaigns to improve personal hygiene&#13;
              practices, focusing on hand washing with soap&#13;
              The study showed that hand washing with soap can lead to substantial economic beneï¬?ts in the form of lower&#13;
              disease incidence and averted health costs, particularly from reduced incidence of diarrheal and infectious skin&#13;
              diseases, and the implications for nutritional status in infants and children. The documented low levels of improved&#13;
              hygiene practices, the relatively low per capita costs of hygiene promotion and the associated beneï¬?ts, justify&#13;
              greater attention by public policy makers and the private sector to improving hygiene practices and availability of&#13;
              hygiene products. As well as stand-alone hand washing with soap campaigns, hygiene promotion can be eï¬&#131;ciently&#13;
              built into all water and sanitation programs and other health campaigns, to reach a greater audience and at lower&#13;
              unit cost.&#13;
&#13;
              Recommendation 4. Further evaluate available sanitation technology and program options for improving&#13;
              sanitation in Indonesia&#13;
              The estimated national economic beneï¬?ts from improving sanitation will provide useful information for sanitation&#13;
              advocacy and policy making, but sanitation program selection needs to be made based on more precise information&#13;
              on the costs and beneï¬?ts of speciï¬?c sanitation options. The various public/private and ï¬?nancial/economic costs and&#13;
              beneï¬?ts need to be better understood in speciï¬?c contexts to inform policy making, program design, community&#13;
              engagement and ï¬?nancing options. Future work conducted under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative will help&#13;
              ï¬?ll the information gap.&#13;

            Economic impacts of sanitation in Indonesia
            : a five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao
            PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of
            Sanitation Initiative (ESI)

            This study is part of a five-country
            study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the
            Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of Sanitation
            Initiative (ESI). The report shows that the high number of
            people living with unimproved household sanitation is
            imposing large financial and economic costs to the
            Indonesian economy, not only to private individuals but also
            to the public and commercial sectors. This is the first
            study in Indonesia to compile economic evidence on a range
            of impacts of poor sanitation and hygiene. The results
            indicate that poor sanitation and hygiene have significant
            financial and economic costs, with major implications for
            the socio-economic development of Indonesia and the
            attainment of short-, medium- and long-term development
            goals. The study highlights the links between improved
            sanitation and several other MDG targets, including poverty,
            hunger reduction, gender equality, child health, access to
            safe drinking water, and the quality of life of
            slum-dwellers. The study demonstrates that poor sanitation
            affects everyone, but especially the poor and vulnerable,
            including children, women, the disabled and senior citizens.
            Hence, sanitation should receive greater attention from all
            levels of Indonesian government, and from development
            partners, the private sector and households. Decision makers
            should act now, and in a concerted way, to stimulate demand
            for improved sanitation and hygiene practices, at the same
            time increasing the opportunities for households to satisfy
            their demand.
