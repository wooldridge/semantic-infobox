                                             organisation, having grown rapidly since its foundation in 1993. During that time it has&#13;
                                             played an important role in the large and urgent programme of water and sanitation&#13;

Salim Ahmed Salim                                This Field Note describes the history of the Mvula Trust's development and looks in detail&#13;
Water Ambassador for Africa                  at its way of working. The Trust balances two roles: the more traditional NGO role of&#13;
                                             community empowerment, advocacy and promotion of innovation; and the role of national&#13;
                                             implementing agency with capacity in most poor rural areas in South Africa. In recent years,&#13;
                                             the Mvula Trust has forged a close and cooperative working relationship with the South&#13;
                                             African Government, which enables it to have a significant influence on government policy.&#13;
                                             The Mvula Trust provides South Africa with an alternative national delivery mechanism for&#13;
                                             poor rural communities. It has clear principles and working methods, and is able both to&#13;
                                             influence the government and to attract substantial financial support. It therefore provides&#13;
                                             an example that may interest other African countries seeking to establish independent&#13;
                                             organisations that work as partners with their governments.&#13;

                                                               from that of direct provider of services to facilitator and&#13;
                                                               regulator. So a new generation of NGOs has emerged to&#13;
                            There is always                    try to bridge the gap. They aim to combine service delivery&#13;
                                                               with advocacy through engagement with government.&#13;
                              something new                    These NGOs seek to have more impact at a larger scale by&#13;
                                                               complementing government initiatives rather than working&#13;
                               out of Africa                   independently from them, as NGOs have traditionally done.&#13;

the new government was defined as one of co-operation&#13;
and constructive engagement. This feature of the Mvula&#13;
Trust was particularly significant at the time, since there&#13;
was a strong tradition of NGOs in the apartheid era being&#13;
anti-government and activist in their orientation.&#13;
Subsequent events have shown that many of the rural&#13;
development NGOs that were established under the&#13;
apartheid regime found it difficult to adopt a different stance&#13;
towards government after the transition to a democratic&#13;
era. The Mvula Trust was also unusual amongst South African&#13;
NGOs in that it was consciously developed as a professional&#13;
organisation emphasising efficiency and paying market-&#13;
related salaries, as distinct from the voluntarist ethic&#13;
promoted by most NGOs.&#13;
   Soon after the new government had established the                               SOUTH AFRICA&#13;
Community Water Supply and Sanitation Programme, an&#13;
agreement was signed in 1995 between the Mvula Trust&#13;
and the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF)&#13;
to formalise the relationship between them. Seven years&#13;
later this remains a unique agreement, in terms of its&#13;
content and scope, between the government and an NGO&#13;
in South Africa. It committed the government to funding&#13;
projects identified by the Mvula Trust (later identified jointly&#13;
by the Trust and the new local governments) to a total           permanent one. By that time, the Trust had not only secured&#13;
value of about 10% of DWAF's annual capital budget.              funding from DWAF for a growing number of projects, but&#13;
The Mvula Trust committed itself to working in co-operation      had also signed agreements with a number of external&#13;

policy development.                                              Australian and Irish governments.&#13;

  Case Study: The Nhlungwane Community Water Supply Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The Nhlungwane project is situated in southern KwaZulu-Natal. The community has approximately 227 households with a population&#13;
  of 1,100. With the assistance of the Mvula Trust, a water project was established and completed in 1997. Since then, the project&#13;
  has been functioning without interruption, and with very high recovery of operating costs. The income, collected from household fees of&#13;
  US$0.7 per month, exceeds the expenses of the water scheme, and this has left the community with a bank balance of over&#13;
  US$1,100 (in early 2002).&#13;
       The scheme uses borehole water, pumped by a diesel-powered pump to an elevated reservoir and then fed by gravity to 41 public&#13;
  tapstands. The tapstands have their own wardens, who are all women (often referred to as `nompompis'). These wardens offer their&#13;
  services voluntarily and the responsibility rotates through the households adjacent to the tapstand. Each warden keeps the key for the&#13;
  tapstand, and every day at a specified time the warden opens the tapstand for the people to come and collect water. The wardens also&#13;
  record the monthly payments of the households around their tapstand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Success factors&#13;
&#13;
  · Nhlungwane village is an inherently cohesive community, in which the Mvula Trust's demand-responsive approach has helped&#13;
  engender a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for the water scheme.&#13;
  · The Village Water Committee has good working relationships with traditional authority structures, and ensures open and regular&#13;
  communication with the villagers through community meetings.&#13;
  · The project was initiated, and is run, by a number of dynamic individuals, who were influential in creating a momentum for the water&#13;
  project among the community members.&#13;
  · The Village Water Committee has an underpinning of community women's organisations, which have been active in the village for&#13;
  decades already.&#13;

Case Study: The Rural Schools Sanitation Programme&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Between1997and2002,theMvulaTrustimplementedtheRuralSchoolsSanitationProgrammewithfundingfromtheEuropeanUnion.&#13;
In more than 150 schools, ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines were constructed, and proper health and hygiene training and&#13;
awareness raising were carried out.&#13;
    The schools were requested to contribute 10% of the construction costs, in order to stimulate a sense of ownership of the project and&#13;
to ensure the accountability of the project committees to parents. Also, the schools were asked to form clusters of at least five&#13;
neighbouring schools which all needed sanitation. This cluster approach had two main advantages. Firstly, unit costs (of administration,&#13;
for example) were lowered as economies of scale became available. Secondly, schools could help each other maintain momentum&#13;
through peer pressure. A disadvantage was the frustration that was felt by some schools as other schools in their clusters failed to keep&#13;
to deadlines and agreements, causing delays for all schools in these clusters.&#13;

it possible to provide sustainable and well-maintained facilities at a much lower cost than with those provided by the government.&#13;
· With so many stakeholders and people involved in the process, it is essential to clarify roles, responsibilities, requirements and&#13;
expectations in advance, in order to avoid disappointment, frustration or other problems.&#13;
· Especially in the case of school sanitation projects, it is important to organise formal and ceremonial project openings. These preserve&#13;

training and awareness raising.&#13;
· To ensure continued appropriate health and hygiene behaviour, education in these areas should be a recurring theme in schools.&#13;
Therefore it is better for health and hygiene instruction to be given by a number of trained teachers within each school, rather than by&#13;
outsiders who may only visit occasionally.&#13;

   Focus for the future&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The Mvula Trust sees four major challenges for the coming years:&#13;
   · To ensure that poor rural communities benefit from the free basic water policy as soon as possible, and that the subsidy is provided in&#13;
   as cost effective a manner as possible, and is sustained.&#13;
   · To expand its rural sanitation programme, giving it equal importance with the water supply programme, and to ensure that the&#13;
   approach used is in line with the development principles of national policy.&#13;
   · To develop water services in a more holistic way, by implementing them in line with national government's Integrated Sustainable&#13;
   Rural Development Strategy.&#13;
   · To maintain its own intellectual independence despite its financial reliance on project income rather than core income.&#13;
       In the light of these challenges, the Mvula Trust intends to step outside the boundaries of water and sanitation provision, to explore&#13;
   related issues such as water resource management, rural livelihoods and local economic development related to access to potable&#13;
   waterandsanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                       7&#13;

      Although the Mvula Trust was created in the unique circumstances of the                                                       Program-Africa Region (WSP-AF)&#13;

The relationship with government&#13;
must be carefully defined&#13;
      Partnership with government can be effective if nurtured by both partners.&#13;
NGOs can help governments through demonstrating good practice, providing&#13;
services, carrying out evaluations and pioneering new policies. On the other&#13;
hand it is important for NGOs to maintain organisational and political&#13;
independence from government, in order to retain credibility at community level&#13;
and act effectively as advocates for the poor.&#13;
      A large-scale, organisationally and politically independent NGO, structured&#13;
with constructive linkages to government's overall policy objectives, can play a&#13;
significant role in speeding up delivery to achieve national sector objectives.&#13;
Independent delivery mechanisms can overcome bureaucratic hurdles and provide&#13;
an external benchmark for government's own performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Competitive advantage lies in&#13;
community-level involvement&#13;
      Those NGOs that focus on developing competency in working with&#13;
communities and ensuring locally sustainable services have a competitive                                                             Acknowledgments&#13;

            The Mvula trust in South Africa : an
            independent partner to the government
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            South Africa's Mvula Trust is a
            large NGO focused exclusively on water and sanitation
            provision for the poor, with an annual operating budget of
            over US$10 million. There are very few indigenous NGOs of
            this size working in water and sanitation in Africa. Yet it
            is also a young organization, having grown rapidly since its
            foundation in 1993. During that time it has played an
            important role in the large and urgent program of water and
            sanitation development in South Africa. This Field Note
            describes the history of the Mvula Trust's development
            and looks in detail at its way of working. The Trust
            balances two roles: the more traditional NGO role of
            community empowerment, advocacy and promotion of innovation;
            and the role of national implementing agency with capacity
            in most poor rural areas in South Africa. In recent years,
            the Mvula Trust has forged a close and cooperative working
            relationship with the South African Government, which
            enables it to have a significant influence on government
            policy. The Mvula Trust provides South Africa with an
            alternative national delivery mechanism for poor rural
            communities. It has clear principles and working methods,
            and is able both to influence the government and to attract
            substantial financial support. It therefore provides an
            example that may interest other African countries seeking to
            establish independent organizations that work as partners
            with their governments.
