SMALL ENTERPRISES AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
POLICY IN THE PHILIPPINES: A CASE STUDY&#13;
This report presents an ex post evaluation of the Small&#13;
and Medium Industries Program introduced in the Philippines in 1974, and&#13;
reassesses the assumptions behind the programs. Its aim is to report&#13;
on the Philippines' experience in a manner that it is hoped will be&#13;
useful to those involved with such programs in other countries, as&#13;
well as the Philippines, and who are interested in their relevance for&#13;
industrial.development. It examines the role of small industries in&#13;
the development process, and how that role is affected by the structure&#13;
of industrial tariffs and investment incentives and by policies towards&#13;
agriculture. The part presenting the ex post studies reveals how&#13;
specific programs--namely, in finance and extension--have worked out&#13;
in practice, and what lessons emerge. It presents first hand evidence&#13;
on risks and administrative costs, and shows how risks have led to&#13;
capital market failures in the past. It makes the case for a relaxation&#13;
of administrative constraints on the structure of interest rates&#13;
together with a continuance or risk-guarantee and extension schemes to&#13;
solve the risk problem--which would persist even if interest rates&#13;
were not administered.&#13;

The following report is one of a series of case studies&#13;
and surveys of small enterprises in developing countries being financed&#13;
by the World Bank's Research Committee (JPO 671-59), The aims of&#13;
this research are to examine the role of small enterprises in providing&#13;
employment and earnings opportunities, and to compare the experiences&#13;
of different countries with various policies. Since it is part&#13;
of a research project, the findings and views expressed in the report&#13;
are not necessarily those of the World Bank.&#13;
The present study began in May 1978 in collaboration with&#13;
the Ministry of Industry. The Development Bank of the Philippines,&#13;
the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund, the Private Development&#13;
Corporation of the Philippines and several private banks and investment&#13;
houses were all 'most generous in providing information about their&#13;
programs and experiences. The NCSO were also helpful in providing&#13;
access to preliminary tabulations and worksheets, and the University&#13;
of the Philippines' Institute for Small-Scale Industries gave us some of&#13;
their research material. The help and co-operation of the staff of these&#13;
institutions is gratefully acknowledged. It does not follow, of course,&#13;
that they necessarily agree with the findings, or that they we in any&#13;
way committed to them.&#13;
Carlos Singer did the background statistical work on the&#13;
text tables and annexes, and was responsible for reviewing source material.&#13;
Mrs. Fajardo was general consultant to the project, and directed the&#13;
interviews and the review of file data reported in Chapter 6.&#13;
Mrs. Tengra administered the research budget and contracts,&#13;

SMALL ENTERPRISES AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
POLICY IN THE PHILIPPINES: A CASE STUDY&#13;
The Main Report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY&#13;
The Scope of the Report&#13;
1.1       Small enterprise programs have been introduced in many developing&#13;
countries over the past thirty years, as an aspect of employment policy.&#13;
The reasons, which are now familiar, are that small enterprises are held&#13;
to be more labor intensive on average than large enterprises, so that a&#13;
shift of investment towards them should help to raise the demand&#13;
for labor. 1/ For the most part the programs have the following elements: 2/&#13;
finance, extension and advisory services, and vocational and management&#13;
training. In some countries infrastructure, industrial estates and&#13;
specialized marketing and technical services (e.g. in handicrafts) are also&#13;
important.&#13;
1.2       Such programs naturally receive extensive analysis when they are&#13;
being prepared and appraised, but rather less is known about how they work&#13;
out in practice. In general terms it can be said that they have proved to&#13;
be administratively costly and a significant risk for the financial insti-&#13;
tutions involved. But the information available is otherwise not con-&#13;
crete and, in addition, both the designs of the programs and what has been&#13;
achieved vary greatly. This has led to proposals for (i) ex post evaluations&#13;
of specific programs to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs,&#13;
and in what ways the costs and the risks can be reduced; and (ii) studies to&#13;
reassess the assumptions behind the programs.&#13;
1.3       The following study of the Philippines experience was prepared with&#13;
these two proposals in mind, and is accordingly in two parts. Part I presents&#13;
an ex post evaluation of the financing and extension programs that were&#13;
introduced in 1974 to assist small and medium industries, and Part II a&#13;
reassessment of assumptions.&#13;
1.4       Something will be said shortly about the concerns that led up to&#13;
the program being introduced in 1974, and why special interventions in&#13;
favor of SSEs were felt to be necessary in order to raise output and the&#13;
demand for labor. The question that immediately springs to mind is could&#13;
not such aims be achieved more effectively through a more efficient system&#13;
of industrial tariffs and incentives, and through a broadly-based development&#13;
of agriculture? These are, of course, the principal instruments at the&#13;
government's disposal for raising output and employment. However, SSE&#13;
programs are not intended to be a "second best" alternative, but instead to&#13;
address specific sources of market failure that may, indeed, limit the&#13;
effectiveness of such desirable policies. In the Philippines' case, the main&#13;
sources of market failure were thought to be those due to the risks of loans not&#13;
heing repaid and to institutional shortcomings in the organized financial sector.&#13;
As will be seen, the enterprise program was precisely designed to address these&#13;
problems. It is obvious, of course, that the efficiency of the programs is not&#13;
independent of the policy environment, since agricultural and industrial developmenl&#13;
1/   See e.g. IBRD (1978) for a recent review, though the labor-intensity&#13;
argument has been made for many years.&#13;
2/   The standard work on the subject is that of Staley and Morse (1966).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
policies affect the prices and the product markets of both small and large&#13;
enterprises; much of this report is in fact concerned with these relation-&#13;
ships. But first it is necessary to understand the nature of the market&#13;
failures that the program was designed to address, what problems were en-&#13;
countered, and what problems remain.&#13;
1.5       This is the task of Part I.   It is in three Chapters, which draw&#13;
on the records of the institutions involved, interviews with the head and&#13;
branch office staff of over 30 institutions in the public and private sector,&#13;
and interviews with the owners of over 80 enterprises that were either small&#13;
or (it turned out) once small. The chapte'rs contain an extensive analysis of&#13;
risks and administrative costs, and of how both changed over time with the&#13;
accumulation of experience and information within the institutions; they also&#13;
show how risks are a function of the screening and supervision procedures&#13;
adopted.&#13;
1.6       From a less operational viewpoint, there is perhaps more that is&#13;
of interest in the reassessment of assumptions in Part II. The analysis in&#13;
Part I provides the empirical basis for a reassessment of the first of four&#13;
assumptions that commonly lay behind small enterprise programs. These concern:&#13;
(i) The case, which some economists have questioned,&#13;
for special interventions in the capital markets&#13;
to support SSEs. Would not risk-reflecting interest&#13;
rates, for example, accomplish the same end? or would&#13;
they extinguish the market, as the recent research on&#13;
uncertainty would suggest? if the latter happens, what&#13;
policy options are open?&#13;
(ii) The. role of small industries in the development process:&#13;
e.g. do they provide a growing source of output and employment,&#13;
as is commonly assumed, and a base for industrial decentralization?&#13;
(iii) How policies towards agriculture and industry affegt the efficiency&#13;
of small industries and (by implication) small industry programs.&#13;
E.g. would a more broadly based development of agriculture and a&#13;
more labor demanding system of industrial incentives raise output&#13;
and economic efficiency in small industries?&#13;
(iv) The conditions of employment, which in the Philippines as&#13;
in most other developing countries are assumed to be&#13;
deteriorating, and are most commonly cited as the prime&#13;
reason for small enterprise programs.&#13;
A discussion of these assumptions takes up the five chapters (5 to 9) that&#13;
comprise Part II. A further comment on each might be helpful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
The Assumptions of Small Enterprise Programs&#13;
1. 7      Capital market failure due to uncertainty has been discussed ex-&#13;
tensively in the literature during the past 20 years, though mostly from a&#13;
theoretical point of view. 1/ Also most studies are concerned with&#13;
explaining the effects of uncertainty on the behaviour of capital markets&#13;
rather than with reaching normative conclusions, which is the aim of the&#13;
present study. But to consider the behavioral side first, how does uncer-&#13;
tainty affect lending to small scale activities? The basic problem faced&#13;
by most institutions arises from the difficulty of distinguishing between&#13;
potentially "good" from "bad" projects. 2/ In situations where there is&#13;
little knowledge or experience within the institutions for dealing with small&#13;
businesses, the probability of financing "bad" projects reaches high levels.&#13;
Risk-and cost-reflecting interest rates, assuming they were politically accept-&#13;
able, would also reach high levels, sufficient perhaps to extinguish any in-&#13;
stitutional interest in the market. High interest rates raise the risks yet&#13;
further by reducing the margins for contingency in the enterprises financed,&#13;
and also raise doubts within the institutions about the capacity of the enter-&#13;
prises to service debts - i.e. there is the possibility of backward sloping&#13;
supply curves. Thus most studies conclude that unregulated interest rates&#13;
might not clear the market and credit rationing would remain. The question&#13;
then arises as to what is the optimum policy.&#13;
1.8       If the risks were irreducible, the unavoidable conclusion would&#13;
be that it is simply inefficient for institutions to finance small firms:&#13;
any program would inevitably have high losses and, assuming these were due&#13;
to 'failed projects, would also imply wasted investments. But further&#13;
analysis shows that the probability of financing a "good" project increases&#13;
1/   A useful edition of papers can be found in Diamond and Rothschild&#13;
(1978).&#13;
2/   As discussed in Akerlof's (1970) well-known study on the market for&#13;
"lemons", "lemons," of course, referring to "bad" projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
with the development of screening and appraisal procedures within the insti-&#13;
tutions, and as the branch staff become more knowledgeable about and experi-&#13;
enced in dealing with small businesses in their local communities. The&#13;
intrinsic riskiness of small firms, while undoubtedly higher than that of&#13;
large firms, is not the over-riding determinant of the risks faced by the&#13;
institutions. There is therefore a process of "learning by doing," and which&#13;
provides an external benefit in that a large number of efficient businesses&#13;
are no longer excluded from access to the organized financial sector by (also&#13;
a large number of) less efficient businesses. In addition, the administrative&#13;
costs of developing lending programs for small industries show significant&#13;
economies of scale.&#13;
1.9.      These factors, taken together, suggest that the best policy to&#13;
pursue is one in which the structure of financial incentives acting on the&#13;
capital markets offers prospects of long-run profitability, wrtn L±sk-guarantee&#13;
schemes acting to cushion the more immediate losses.    This is the essence of&#13;
our recommendations in the ex post evaluation in Part I, and in the theoretical&#13;
discussion of interventions in Chapter 5 of Part II.    Where we see a problem&#13;
with the present policies towards small scale (in the Philippines as in other&#13;
~-c- riesT-it is that--th-e-financiaI incentives do not offer prospects of long-&#13;
run profitability and, in consequence, even highly efficient small firms are&#13;
frequently deprived of access to institutional credit in the private sector,&#13;
and grow to depend greatly on government programs.&#13;
1.10      The second assumption noted above concerns the role of small enter-&#13;
prises in the development process, and requires less introduction. It is&#13;
obvious that any small enterprise program if it is to be worthwhile rests on&#13;
the assumption that the kinds of small scale activities to be assisted should&#13;
be an efficient and growing source of output and employment; otherwise there&#13;
would be an insufficient demand for the financial and non-financial services&#13;
provided, and few benefits from "learning by doing" and economies of scale.&#13;
In addition, certain characteristics of small enterprises need to be under-&#13;
stood if the programs are to be helpful. It would, for instance, be unthink-&#13;
able for an agricultural development program to be designed without first&#13;
hand knowledge of the crops, cropping practices, markets, processing and&#13;
input-supply arrangements being available. Similar remarks apply to small&#13;
enterprise programs. Fortunately a number of studies (cited in the text) are&#13;
available on this subject and Chapter 6 simply seeks to update and expand on&#13;
them in various ways by presenting further interview data, and some recent&#13;
information from the labor force and establishment censuses.&#13;
1.11      The third assumption noted above is often not made explicit in&#13;
small enterprise programs, and is that more efficient (and also more labor&#13;
demanding) policies towards agriculture and industry would make the programs&#13;
themselves more efficient. (Put more technically, it is assumed that a&#13;
shadow pricing analysis, allowing for the effects on markets of shadow and&#13;
actual prices moving into alignment, would also show the programs to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
economically desirable.) Our analysis in Chapter 7 supports this assumption&#13;
on three grounds. First, it is shown that small industries are heavily con-&#13;
centrated in efficient sectors that have, on balance, been discriminated&#13;
against under the system of industrial incentives and tariffs that were&#13;
applied in the Philippines up to 1980. The analysis here draws on several&#13;
studies published in the last 10 years on industrial and agricultural devel-&#13;
opment policy in the Philippines, including Powers and Sicat (1971), ILO&#13;
(1974), Bautista and Powers (1980), IBRD (1976 and 1980) and others. Second,&#13;
a greater emphasis on a broadly-based development of agriculture (and which&#13;
has been a feature of the development programs in the 1970s) would (and&#13;
indeed already has) provide a greater stimulous to the development of the&#13;
product markets in the provinces. The evidence is that small scale activi-&#13;
ties are highly responsive to these markets, and regions experiencing a rapid&#13;
and broadly based growth of agriculture are also experiencing a rapid devel-&#13;
opment of both small and large scale activities in the local urban centers.&#13;
Third, as the above cited studies have shown, more efficient industrial in-&#13;
centives would also raise the demand for labor in large scale activities in&#13;
the Philippines, since the present incentives have generally favored the&#13;
capital intensive sectors and, in addition, offered a range of tax concessions&#13;
on capital but not on labor costs. As far as we can see, a rising demand for&#13;
labor in large scale should also stimulate the domestic markets for both small&#13;
and large scale's products. We thus conclude that there is a positive asso-&#13;
ciation between the efficiency of leading sector policies and the efficiency&#13;
of the small enterprise programs.&#13;
1.12      With respect to the fourth assumption - concerning the conditions of&#13;
employment in the Philippines - the analysis in Chapter 8 shows that un and under-&#13;
employment rates have not been rising as commonly thought; in fact they have been&#13;
declining steadily for over 15 years, according to all available measures, to&#13;
quite low levels. What has happened instead is that labor supply and demand&#13;
conditions have brought about declining real wages in many sectors, and undoubtedly&#13;
declining real incomes for some families. On the other hand occupational shifts&#13;
towards better paying forms of wage employment have been widespread, while there&#13;
have been productivity anrd income gains among the self-employed in agriculture&#13;
and industry. Thus as several writers have observed in other countries, the&#13;
"employment problem" in the Philippinestrelates not to the lack but to the type&#13;
of employment that is available, and the low incomes it provides. This conclusion&#13;
is neither new nor surprising, but it does have implications for the way small&#13;
enterprise programs are designed and implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.13      There is a tendency, for instance, in the Philippines as in other&#13;
countries, to support only those firms that are "creating jobs." This is&#13;
revealed in a preference for financing fixed assets over working capital,&#13;
and for assisting enterprises that are expanding employment over those simply&#13;
seeking modernization without such expansion. Furthermore, projects with&#13;
incremental capital-labor ratios above a certain threshold are commonly&#13;
rejected on the grounds that insufficient jobs are being "created" by the&#13;
investments. All these policies,it seems to us, place an unnecessary con-&#13;
straint on what the programs might otherwise accomplish, and stem from a&#13;
misperception about the levels of unemployment as opposed to the conditions&#13;
of employment. It seems to us that there is nothing undesirable about&#13;
financing profitable small firms even if no expansion of employment or of&#13;
fixed assets is involved.&#13;
1.14      To provide further clarifications on this point, Chapter 9 presents&#13;
a formal discussion of project selection criteria. In the labor markets&#13;
faced by small enterprises in the Philippines, actual wages seem the best&#13;
available approximation to the opportunity costs of labor, which vary greatly&#13;
by region., over time, with skill level and with occupation. It follows from&#13;
this that the right kinds of projects to support are those capable of pro-&#13;
viding for labor-s income and earning a surplus after all other costs have&#13;
been met; that is, we see nothing wrong with the rate of return to capital&#13;
as a criterion for selecting prolects. Where there are&#13;
distortions in the product and factor markets, some modifications (using&#13;
shadow prices) might of course be necessary. Since it would obviously be&#13;
impractical to appraise thousands of very small investments using cost-ben-&#13;
efit analysis, we have suggested instead that the research and evaluation&#13;
departments of the larger institutions involved in the program might under-&#13;
take the analysis periodically for samples of projects ex post; apart from&#13;
its value in setting ground rules for lending (e.g. in which sectors to lend)&#13;
such analysis would serve many other purposes connected with ex post&#13;
evaluation and, in addition, provide first hand information on how industrial&#13;
tariff policies affect small industries.&#13;
1.15      The conclusions to Parts I and II are brought together briefly in&#13;
Chapter 10,and are set out in more detail at the end of each chapter. While&#13;
most of the conclusions reached naturally relate only to the Philippines, an&#13;
attempt is made throughout the report to make some points that may be relevant&#13;
to those involved with SSE programs and employment policy in other countries.&#13;
Perspective on the Philippines' Small and Medium Industries Program&#13;
1.16      As a background to Part I of the report some comments on the cir-&#13;
cumstances that led to the introduction of the Small and Medium Industries&#13;
(SMI) program in the Philippines might be helpful. 1/&#13;
1/   A note on the use of the terms "Small and Medium Industries" and "small&#13;
enterprises" is provided in the Annex to Chapter 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

1.17       In most developing countries, manufacturing employment is predomi-&#13;
nantly in households, workshops and small factories. A large share - partic-&#13;
ularly in small-scale manufacturing - is also found in the rural and urban&#13;
areas of agricultural provinces, serving the markets generated by agricultural&#13;
growth. But for several reasons discussed above, institutional finance and&#13;
the supporting services for industry are heavily concentrated on large scale&#13;
manufacturing in metropolitan areas. Insofar as this concentration of invest-&#13;
ment is the result of uncertainties and institutional shortcomings in the&#13;
capital markets it reflects an avoidable constraint on the efficient growth&#13;
of industrial output and earnings opportunities in provincial, mostly agri-&#13;
cultural areas. The idea behind small enterprise programs then is to address&#13;
the problems of uncertainty and institutional development, increase the avail-&#13;
ability of finance and supporting services to small enterprises, and in doing&#13;
so hopefully contribute to a more regionally balanced growth of industry.&#13;
1.18      These were broadly the purposes behind the small and medium industry&#13;
programs introduced in the Philippines in 1974. In the previous twenty years&#13;
the labor force had increased from 7 to 14 million, and by the mid 1970s&#13;
500 thousand people were entering the labor market each year; there was (and&#13;
remains) in consequence a continual pre-occupation about labor absorption.&#13;
The bulk of industrial investment was taking place in Manila and its surround-&#13;
ing regions, and had been facilitated by an extraordinary growth of the or-&#13;
ganized financial sector, at over 11% per year in real terms, from an already&#13;
large base, over the previous 20 years. In 1977 for instance, 87% of the&#13;
total loans and investments of the private commercial banks (the largest&#13;
financial institutions in the country) were in Metropolitan Manila, with 83%&#13;
of their industrial lending being to medium and large scale industries. In&#13;
contrast, workshop and factory-based manufacturing empl6yment was both more&#13;
extensive and growing more rapidly in the provinces. This can be seen from&#13;
the estimates provided in Table 1.1.&#13;

The high growth rates of establishment-based production in the provinces are&#13;
a comparatively recent happening, and apparently reverse a trend experienced&#13;
in the 1950s (and probably much of the 1960s) when agricultural development&#13;
was given a low priority.&#13;
1.19      The above table provides a breakdown for only three scale categories.&#13;
It is unfortunately not possible, from the data available, to obtain a more&#13;
detailed breakdown of the size structure by region. But the data for the&#13;
whole country shown in Table 1.2 indicate that the rate of growth of employ-&#13;
ment, and the rates of formation of manufacturing establishments, are rela-&#13;
tively high in all the small and medium size groups, except in household&#13;
manufacturing.&#13;
1.20      The distribution of industrial employment by scale and by region&#13;
are to be examined at length in the following report. But it might be noted,&#13;
first, that the declining share of household manufacturing in the provinces&#13;
should not be interpreted negatively. It reflects the structural changes&#13;
towards establishment-based production resulting from gradual improvements in&#13;
infrastructure and transport services in the provinces, and from the markets&#13;
generated by agricultural growth. Second, a significant portion of the growth&#13;
of medium and large scale industry has its roots in the expansion of once&#13;
small firms. In the 1970s an increase in the rate of growth of provincial&#13;
industries was expected as a consequence of a new emphasis to be placed on&#13;
agricultural development; it was this that led to the idea of a regionally&#13;
based program to address constraints on the flow of finance and supporting&#13;
services to small and medium industries. 1/&#13;
1.21      The shape of the program that was adopted followed from the sources&#13;
of market failure discussed above:&#13;
-    To offset the propensity of the private financial&#13;
sector to lend only to the corporate sector, direct&#13;
lending to SMIs by the government banks (principally&#13;
the Development Bank of the Philippines) was introduced.&#13;
This was also intended to act as a risk-sharing device&#13;
between the public and private sector;&#13;
-    To encourage the private sector to develop the&#13;
administrative capacity to lend to small enterprises,&#13;
and to cushion the risks, a rediscounting facility,&#13;
known as the Industrial Guarantee Loan Fund, with risk&#13;
guarantees built into it, was made available to accredited&#13;
private sector institutions. This also increased the&#13;
geographic reach of the program by utilizing the extensive&#13;
branch network of the private sector;&#13;
1/   An outline of the arguments can be found in the ILO (1974) report.    Most&#13;
of the Covernment documents and memoranda, which naturally provide more&#13;
detailed documentation, have never been published.&#13;

To address the problems posed by the transactions&#13;
costs faced by the owners themselves, when first&#13;
applying for institutional credit, an extension&#13;
serv'ice was established. Advisory services were&#13;
also made available on other aspects of the&#13;
management and running of small businesses.&#13;
Less attention was paid to the other constraints acting on the capital mar-&#13;
kets, namely those stemming from ceilings on interest rates and various&#13;
Central Bank regulations on borrowing-and lending operations.&#13;

It should be added here that several other programs to assist small enter-&#13;
prises in the Philippines have been in existence for some years, and were&#13;
instituted before the above SMI program. They include vocational training,&#13;
entrepreneurial training, various research and marketing services, and assis-&#13;
tance to handicraft ("cottage") industries. They have not been reviewed in&#13;

(A) INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES&#13;
Introduction&#13;
2.1       As of December 31, 1978 the total assets of the Philippines finan-&#13;
cial sector amounted to P 163.1 billion. The following table indicates the&#13;
types of institutions holding assets in excess of 1% of the total assets of&#13;

The sector has two major components: the banking system and the non-banking&#13;
system. 1/ The former comprises commercial banks, rural banks, thrift banks,&#13;
development banks and savings and loan associations, and which together&#13;
accounted for 88% of loans and investments outstanding of the financial sector&#13;
in 1978. The non-banking system accounted for the remaining 12% and consists&#13;
of government sponsored insurance programs such as the Social Security System,&#13;
the Government Service Insurance System and the Agricultural Credit Adminis-&#13;
tration; it also includes institutions such as investment houses, finance&#13;
companies and public and private insurance companies.&#13;
1/   The roles of the various financial institutions are summarized in Annex 2&#13;
of Chapter 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.2       The rapid expansion of the financial sector since 1950 has been&#13;
associated with a corresponding expansion of branch networks throughout the&#13;
country. This was mainly to broaden the resource base; the commercial banks&#13;
for example now have nearly 800 branches in the provinces and about 500 in&#13;
Metro-Manila; 70-75% of their incremental resources came from deposits in the&#13;
years 1976 and 1977. But as noted earlier, lending to small enterprises by&#13;
financial institutions accounts only for a small share of their total lending&#13;
to industry and commerce.&#13;
2.3       Term loans for small enterprises are available from commercial&#13;
banks, private development banks, the savings and loan associations, rural&#13;
banks, and some non-bank financial institutions. 1/ 2/ But for reasons&#13;
discussed below, most of the term-loans are provided through two Government&#13;
programs: the Small and Medium Industry (SMI) lending activities of the&#13;
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), and the Industrial Guarantee Loan&#13;
Fund (IGLF), the Government s rediscounting facility available to ffn`nh.ial&#13;
institutions in the private sector. The IGLF program is intended to comple-&#13;
ment private sector and DBP financing in several ways. Since several com-&#13;
mercial banks and non-bank financial intermediaries participate in it, the&#13;
Government's program has a far wider geographic reach than would have been&#13;
possible if SSE lending were confined only to DBP and its branches. Through&#13;
its risk guarantee facility, the program also provides an inducement to&#13;
private sector financial institutions to develop procedures for handling&#13;
long-term loans to SSEs. In regions where both DBP and IGLF financing is&#13;
available, the entrepreneur is provided with the opportunity of borrowing&#13;
from either a government institution (namely DBP) or a private financial in-&#13;
stitution operating as the conduit for IGLF funds. Finally, the composition&#13;
of the IGLF program enables the inherent risk of SSE lending to be spread&#13;
between institutions rather than being concentrated in any one institution.&#13;
2.4       While the Covernment directly controls the resources of DBP and&#13;
IGLF, it exerts an indirect control over the mobilization and allocation of&#13;
private sector resources through its fiscal, monetary and interest rate poli-&#13;
cies. The structure and level of interest rates have had a major impact on&#13;
the relative availability of short - and long-term finance in the economy as&#13;
a whole, and the allocation of resources between different types of borrowers.&#13;
2.5       The following analysis assesses how these various programs and poli-&#13;
cies have affected the profitability of lending to small enterprises.    For&#13;
each type of financial institution the weighted average cost of their sources&#13;
of funds is first computed, and compared with the use of and return on funds&#13;
by type of borrower. The difference between the two gives the gross spread&#13;
accruing to the financial institution, and which is available to cover the&#13;
1/   Principally, the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines&#13;
(PDCP), and the Philippine Investment Systems Organization (PISO).&#13;

transactions costs, 1/ and provide for profits. From the gross spread,&#13;
administrative costs are deducted to arrive at the net spread to the insti-&#13;
tution. The net spread is then examined in relation to actual arrears levels&#13;
on principal and interest, the ageing of arrears, and the probability of&#13;
default, to provide an indication of the risks.&#13;
Commercial Banks&#13;
2.6       Background.   As of December 31, 1978 commercial banks accounted&#13;
for 55% of the total assets of the financial system; over the last five years&#13;
the assets of commercial banks have increased fourfold (in current terms).&#13;
The commercial banking sector comprises 25 privately-owned banks, 2/ and two&#13;
government banks.   Together they had an extensive network of 1,200 branches in&#13;
1978, reaching to all regions of the country. About one third of commercial&#13;
bank lending goes to industry while another third to commerce.&#13;
2.7       Sources and Cost of Funds.   At the end of 1977 the total assets of&#13;
the commercial banking system amounted to P 70.4 billion ($9.5 billion). 3/&#13;
A summarized balance sheet of commercial banks is given in Annex I, Table 2.3.&#13;
Deposits, borrowings and equity plus reserves accounted for 50%, 41% and 9%&#13;
respectively of total liabilities. In recent times there has been a sharp&#13;
increase in the liabilities of commercial banks; over the period 1976-1977&#13;
deposits increased by P 8.2 billion and accounted for 74% of the increase in&#13;
liabilities over the same period. The sharp increase in deposits has occurred&#13;
both as a result of the expansion in the branch network of commercial banks 4/&#13;
and legislative action taken by the Central Bank. The Central Bank Circulars&#13;
of January 1976 attempted to increase the level of bank deposits both by&#13;
raising the maximum interest rate payable on deposits and by reducing the&#13;
yield on money market instruments which had been used by investors as an&#13;
alternate form of investment to bank deposits.&#13;
1/   The transaction costs faced by the financial institutions are the sum of&#13;
(a) the administration costs of loan appraisal, supervision and collec-&#13;
tion, and (b) the risks involved, i.e., the probability of arrears and&#13;
default and its associated cost. The two are interrelated in that a&#13;
substantive effort in loan appraisal and supervision, for instance,&#13;
considerably reduces the risk of arrears and default.&#13;
2/   The Government-owned Philippine National Bank is the largest commercial&#13;
bank and in 1977 accounted for 27% of the assets of the banking system.&#13;
3/   Exchange rate used US$1 = P 7.4.&#13;
4/   New branches were established (109 in 1977) largely because it was felt&#13;
that they could help mobilize deposits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.8       All the commercial banks interviewed were offering the maximum per-&#13;
mitted rate on deposits placed with them, namely 7% on savings deposits and&#13;
8.5% to 12% on time deposits, depending on maturity; no intersst is paid on&#13;
demand deposits. Owing to both the structure of deposits and the interest&#13;
rate paid on various types of deposits, their weighted average cost, in 1977,&#13;
amounted to about 6.5%. This figure, however, reflects merely the financial&#13;
cost of deposits and, since all commercial banks offer the maximum permitted&#13;
rate on all deposit categories, ignore~s the various service costs involved in&#13;
raising deposits. The cost of money market and other borrowings ranges around&#13;
14% while the cost of equity has been computed at around 12.8% 1/ resulting&#13;
in a weighted overall cost of capital of around 11% p.a. The cost of loan-&#13;
able resources is, however, higher than this, since Central Bank regulations&#13;
necessitate holding 20% of borrowings in liquid assets which yield .3% while&#13;
another 20% have to be held in specified securities yielding around 12%.&#13;
Consequently, the weighted average cost of loanable resources is nearer&#13;
13.3%. 2/ Clearly the cost of capital and loanable funds for individual banks&#13;
will vary and will, to a great extent, be determined by the proportion of&#13;
deposits and other borrowings in their liability structure. The weighted&#13;
average cost of resources would also rise if the proportion of medium and&#13;
long-term deposits were to increase; at present these account for less than&#13;
one sixth of their resource base.&#13;
2.9       Uses of and Return on Funds.   As of December 31, 1977 the asset&#13;
portfolio of commercial banks comprised: loans (62%), investments (16%),&#13;
cash due from banks (13%) and other assets (9%). The loan portfolio of&#13;
P 43 billion ($5.8 billion) comprised loans, discounts and overdrafts. An&#13;
interest rate ceiling is imposed by the Central Bank: the maximum interest&#13;
rate permitted on loans under two years is 12% and 14% p.a. on secured and&#13;
unsecured loans respectively. In addition, a service fee of up to 2% may be&#13;
charged raising the effective rate to 14% and 16% respectively. The maximum&#13;
effective lending rate (including service fees) on loans over 2 years is 19%.&#13;
2.10      As of December 31, 1977, 86% of loans outstanding were short-term&#13;
(up to 1 year), 10% were medium-term (1-3 years) and only 4% were long-term&#13;
(over 3 years). In the case of prime borrowers it was found the commercial&#13;

(adjusted on a pre-tax basis) to the book value of equity has been con-&#13;
sidered. While there are a number of objections to estimating the cost&#13;
of share capital in this way, no other data are available. A more pre-&#13;
cise estimate would not significantly alter the overall weighted average&#13;
cost of capital, however, since this source of funds accounts for less&#13;
than 9% of resources. E.g. if we doubled the above estimate, the w.a.&#13;

Given a weighted average cost of funds of 13.3% the effective gross margin&#13;
on short-term loans to prime and nonprime borrowers would be around 2.7% for&#13;
medium-term loans it would be nearer 5.7%. As noted earlier, the latter&#13;
overstates the spread on medium term loans, since the cost of term resources&#13;
is above the weighted average estimated here. 1/&#13;
2.11      Term lending.  While commercial banks are a major source of short-&#13;
term credit they engage in relatively little long-term lending. For January-&#13;
August 1977, 60% of total credit granted was for a year, 1% was for.l-5 years&#13;
and 0.6% for over 5 years. The comparable figures for 1976 were 68.6%, 0.6%&#13;
and 1.02%. Though nothing in the rules and regulations governing commercial&#13;
banks prevent them from lending long, these figures show that little medium&#13;
and long-term lending is undertaken by them. This, in part, can be explained&#13;
by their adherence to the "golden rule" of banking which states that the&#13;
maturity structure of the resource base should match that of the loan's made.&#13;
Despite the rule some term transformation 2/ can occur without jeopardizing&#13;
the solvency of the individual institutions or the system as a whole. How-&#13;
ever, commercial banks appear to be extremely reluctant to lend long-term for&#13;
several reasons.&#13;
1/   PDCP have recently raised medium-term resources at 15-16% (para 2.32),&#13;
which would imply a spread of around 3%.&#13;

cial Sector mission (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
2.12      First, and most important, taking all costs and returns into account,&#13;
short-term lending appears to be at least as profitable as long-term lending.&#13;
Until 1976, the maximum interest rate that could be charged on loans, irre-&#13;
spective of maturity, were 12% for loans secured by real estate and 14% for&#13;
others. As these maximum rates were being charged by commercial banks for&#13;
short-term loans, there was no incentive for them to lend long-term, an activ-&#13;
ity inherently more risky than short-term lending. In 1976, interest rates&#13;
were restructured and the maximum effective rate that can now be charged on&#13;
loans up to two years is 16% while the maximum effective rate on loans over&#13;
two years is 19%. However, while the CB is willing, under certain circum-&#13;
stances, to discount short-term paper (up to one year) is not willing to do&#13;
so for instruments with a maturity of over a year. 1/ Further, in an economy&#13;
where deposit and lending rates have fluctuated significantly 2/ commercial&#13;
banks are unwilling to lend long-term as they are then locked into a leading&#13;
rate without knowing how deposit rates or lending rates may move. Finally,&#13;
most commercial banks do not have the institutional expertise necessary to&#13;
make term loans since most of their experience is with short-term, collateral&#13;
based lending. The current nominal interest rate differential of about 3%&#13;
between short-term loans and long-term loans is not sufficient to induce the&#13;
commercial banks to lend long-term and face the liquidity constraint, the&#13;
greater resource costs, the greater project risk and general uncertainty of&#13;
so doing.&#13;
2.13      Instead of lending long, the practice followed by the commercial&#13;
banks is to book a loan as short with the understanding that the loan will&#13;
be rolled over. 3/ On the basis of existing information, it is not possible&#13;
to quantify the extent of rollovers. However, interviews suggest that up&#13;
to about half of those loans booked as short-term may be rolled over for at&#13;
least another year, and one third for 1-3 years. The process of rolling over&#13;
is also profitable for the bank owing to the service fees and other charges&#13;
involved. This additional income further reduces the effective differential&#13;
between short- and long-term lending rates and may even turn short-term lending&#13;
into the more profitable type of operation.&#13;
2.14      Lending to SSE. The proportion of loans outstanding going to home,&#13;
small- and medium-scale industries as of December 31, 1977 amounted to 2%, 11%&#13;
and 11% respectively. 4/ These figures probably do not reflect the situation&#13;
1/   This possibility is now being considered, however.&#13;
2/   There were substantial changes with respect to both deposit and lending&#13;
rates in 1976 and 1977.&#13;
3/   With this arrangement the enterprise, not the institution, bears the&#13;
risks.&#13;
4/   Annex 1, Table 2.4, provides a breakdown of commercial bank lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
accurately as a large proportion of these resources are IGLF funds which are&#13;
merely being onlent by the commercial banks. There appears to be no data on&#13;
the volume of commercial bank resources going to the small enterprise sector.&#13;
Using a sampling technique, a study conducted by the International Development&#13;
Center of Japan concluded that only 1% of SSE resources come from commercial&#13;
or rural banks. There are several reasons which explain the reluctance of&#13;
commercial banks to lend to this sector, except perhaps to a small minority&#13;
of small borrowers of good standing. First, the effective return on loans&#13;
to prime and near-prime clients, once compensating business is taken into&#13;
account, amounts to about 16% for short-term loans and 19% for longer term&#13;
loans (para 2.10). Since these rates are the maximum that can be charged,&#13;
the return on SME loans is not likely to be significantly greater than this,&#13;
particularly as they bring in little compensating business. 1/ However, while&#13;
the return on prime and SSE loans is almost the same, the administrative costs&#13;
per unit lent of processing SSE loans is significsntly greater. The adminis-&#13;
trative costs are higher because there is no readily available information on&#13;
the credit standing of the enterprise since most SSEs have neither audited&#13;
financial statements nor long standing relations with the financial community.&#13;
During discussions with commercial banks it became clear that the loan pro-&#13;
cessing time for prime companies was minimal, and costs amounted to less than&#13;
0.4% of loan value. In the case of near prime companies, the complete loan&#13;
processing time varied between 1-4 days and costs seldom accounted for more&#13;
than 0.5% of the loan value. In thecase of loans to SSEs without an estab-&#13;
lished track record the processing costs amount to approximately 2-3% of&#13;
the loan value. Hence, deducting these costs from the gross margin of 2.7%&#13;
estimated above (para 2.10), the net margin accruing to commercial banks to&#13;
cover provisions, writeoffs and profits would be 0.7% and 2.3% for SSE and&#13;
regular loans respectively. If, in addition, it is assumed that SSE loans&#13;
are more risky, then both elements of the risk-return trade-off favor larger&#13;
loans. At present there is little hard data for commercial banks on the&#13;
relative riskiness of SSE lending and other types of lending. Experiments&#13;
involving commercial banks in SSE lending have shown that without rigorous&#13;
appraisal and supervision procedures (which raises the administrative costs&#13;
still further) small loans are prone to high arrears. 2/&#13;
1/   It was pointed out to us that some SMEs bring in compensating business&#13;
(e.g. through foreign exchange dealings), and others have good standings&#13;
and qualify as prime borrowers. They are, however, a small minority,&#13;
and our remarks are not addressed to these cases.&#13;
2/   Some examples quoted were the money-shop program of the PCIB, the "social&#13;
loans" programs run by some commercial banks in the 1960s and 1970s, and&#13;
a NACIDA loan program, which was initially run outside the banking system,&#13;
but later redesigned and run by the Philippine National Bank. In each&#13;
instance arrears were extremely high (in one case 93% of loans were in&#13;
default).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.15      Second, in the cases when commercial banks go in for SSE lending&#13;
it tends to be collateral based. Many small borrowers, however, are short&#13;
of acceptable collateral, particularly in the case of new projects, and are&#13;
therefore ineligible for commercial bank credit. Finally, even if commercial&#13;
banks were to lend to SSEs on the basis of project viability it might be&#13;
difficult to do so as they currently do not have the necessary institutional&#13;
expertise to undertake such lending.&#13;
2.16      Long-Term Lending and IGLF.   Commercial banks operate as conduits&#13;
channeling long-term IGLF resources to SSEs. When the lending to SSEs first&#13;
began in 1974, the commercial banks would identify a project and send it to&#13;
IGLF for approval. Once approval was granted, the project risk would be&#13;
shared between IGLF and the Bank on a 60:40 ratio, the bank having a gross&#13;
spread of 5% on the transaction. Since none.of the bank's own resources were&#13;
tied up in the transaction, the spread was available to cover the administra-&#13;
tive costs of lending and 40% of the risk. In theory, loans were to range&#13;
between P 50,000 to P 800,000 although in practice no loans over P 500,000&#13;
were made. Maturities were for 5-10 years while the effective interest rate&#13;
(including the guarantee fee) to the final recipient was 13.2%.&#13;
2.17      The initial response to the program by the commercial banks was&#13;
encouraging; in the period July-December 1975, 91 loans were approved of which&#13;
25 were sponsored by commercial banks. However, the number of projects spon-&#13;
sored fell sharply and only 19 IGLF projects, in total, were approved in FY77.&#13;
Two reasons were given by commercial banks for their lack of interest: the&#13;
inadequate return and the "red tape" involved in dealing with IGLF. The red&#13;
tape problem was reduced significantly once the accreditation scheme was put&#13;
into effect in 1976. Under this scheme an accredited institution could approve&#13;
a loan without the prior approval of IGLF. Nevertheless, the commercial banks&#13;
generally remained unwilling to participate in the program. Initially (in&#13;
1974/75) 19 banks participated, but as of September 1, 1978 only 10 had been&#13;
accredited, of which only 5 made any IGLF loans. As of September 30, 1978 the&#13;
IGLF loans outstanding to commercial banks amounted to P 42 million, or about&#13;
0.5% of their total loans outstanding to manufacturing activities.&#13;
2.18      The high level of arrears associated with earlier IGLF operations&#13;
was the main explanation for the continued unwill-ingness of commercial banks&#13;
to participate. As of September 1978 total arrears amounted to 34.2% of loans&#13;
outstanding while loans affected 1/ were 56.4% by number and 52.1% by value.&#13;
When the final recipient was in arrears, the bank was still expected to make&#13;
good to IGLF; in such a case the bank tied up its own resources on which it&#13;
earned 12% 2/ but might have earned 16% to 19% if these resources were lent&#13;
to its regular clients. In addition there were the costs of processing the&#13;
arrears which in their turn can be broken down into three parts. These are&#13;
1/   Based on a sample survey of participating institutions and their end&#13;
users.&#13;
2/   While its own cost of funds was 13.3%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
the cost of (a) rescheduling the loans for some clients, 1/ which might in-&#13;
volve a complete reappraisal; this cost is more closely related to the number&#13;
of loans in arrears than the actual amount in arrears; (b) write-offs for&#13;
"coffin" cases; and (c) litigation, which is an expensive but necessary step&#13;
both to recover the value of the collateral and to maintain confidence in the&#13;
institution. 2/ It has not been possible to compute the costs associated with&#13;
loan rescheduling, write-offs and litigation. However, from the reaction of&#13;
the banks to IGLF, it appears that they exceeded the 5% gross margin on the&#13;
loan, particularly since the commercial banks have had to make good to IGLF&#13;
from their own resources.&#13;
2.19      The aggregate data, however, hide what has in fact been a very mixed&#13;
experience among the commercial banks; some have used IGLF occasionally and&#13;
have found the operation profitable, with less than 5% of their loans in&#13;
arrears; others have used it rarely, but again with low or no arrears; while,&#13;
in the case of some banks, 50% to 90% of their loans were in arrears. 3/&#13;
During the interviews it became apparent that there were two basic reasons for&#13;
the relative success of some banks, First, the successful banks generally&#13;
had applied far stricter standards in project selection, paying particular&#13;
attention to the credit standing of the entrepreneur in the community, his&#13;
previous track record and the value of the collateral offered; a personal&#13;
knowledge of the 'character' of the individual, acquired by the local branch&#13;
staff and branch manager, was also important. 4/ Second, a fair amount of&#13;
time and effort appeared to. have been devoted to loan appraisal, supervision&#13;
and collection. It became clear that, whenever one or more of these criteria&#13;
had been relaxed, the level of arrears increased sharply. Several cases were&#13;
cited in which borrowers had diverted funds or were giving a low priority to&#13;
repaying the IGLF loan as the interest rate on the IGLF loan was lower than&#13;
on other borrowings. These instances reflected the weak supervision and loan&#13;
collection procedures of the financing institutions. In some cases collateral&#13;
requirements had been relaxed to match the bank's share in the risk (40% on&#13;
IGLF loans); these had resulted in larger and riskier loans being permitted&#13;
than if stricter appraisal standards had been applied. It should be added&#13;
that such problems did not necessarily arise because the banks took IGLF&#13;
1/   It is not known to what extent rescheduling costs are covered by penalty&#13;
rates.&#13;
2/   It has been pointed out to us that the costs of processing arrears also&#13;
decline as an institution's procedures are developed. Apparently the&#13;
costs in Korean banks are now quite low.&#13;
3/   This information was obtained during the interviews; the estimates were&#13;
provided unofficially and are not precise.&#13;
4/   Mr. Manalo of DBP made precisely the same point, which we found was inde-&#13;
pendently shared by the staff of several commercial banks and investment&#13;
houses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
lending lightly, but because for several banks IGLF was a new form of lending&#13;
(long-term versus short-term and project versus collateral based) to a new&#13;
category of client, and required more effort in appraisal and supervision&#13;
than had been anticipated; only for a small minority of SMI owners, with&#13;
good standing, is it possible to relax the discipline of appraisal and base&#13;
the loans, as in short-term lending, on 'character and collateral'; most SMI&#13;
projects did not fall into this category however. The experience of DBP, PDCP&#13;
and of the Medium and Small Industries Coordinated Action Program (MASICAP)&#13;
programs has shown that a substantial pre-loan service for preparing project&#13;
and loan requests is required due to the extremely poor records and informa-&#13;
tion kept by small enterprises. 1/ None of the commercial banks help the&#13;
entrepreneur prepare projects but, instead, concentrate almost entirely on&#13;
collateral based lending.&#13;
2.20      Conclusions.   Commercial banks have found that the administrative&#13;
costs and the risks of participating in the IGLF program were higher than&#13;
originally anticipated. A few commercial banks have found lending to SSEs,&#13;
profitable, both from their own resources and IGLF funds, but only by con-&#13;
centrating on a small number of clients with track records and good credit&#13;
standings. Since most SSEs do not have an established credit standing, it&#13;
is unlikely that the commercial banks would lend to them without financial&#13;
incentives sufficient to cover the costs of pre-loan services (to complement&#13;
those provided by MASICAP) and more rigorous loan appraisal, supervision and&#13;
collection procedures. In cases when the commercial banks attempted to keep&#13;
administrative costs low and sacrificed on loan screening procedures there&#13;
have been high rates of arrears and default.&#13;
2.21      For these reasons, some modifications have recently been introduced&#13;
into the IGLF program. 2/   These were:&#13;
(a)  To increase the spreads and reduce the bnk's&#13;
share of the risks on small loans;     J&#13;
(b)  To raise the returns and reduce the risks further&#13;
by raising the upper limit on IGIF loans (from&#13;
P 800,000 to P 2.5 million), thus allowing the&#13;
banks to lend to medium as well as small industries;&#13;
(c)  To reinforce the MASICAP program of technical&#13;
assistance, particularly to the smaller enterprises,&#13;
by improving the quality of information available on&#13;
the enterprise, thereby reducing the transaction costs&#13;
faced by the lending institution.&#13;

- 21 -&#13;
In addition, a forum for the exchange of views and experiences between insti-&#13;
tutions seems desirable in the early stages of the program, together with&#13;
the establishment of a common credit record-keeping system. The methods and&#13;
criteria for appraising loans to SSEs and pre- and post-loan services have&#13;
not yet been developed in the commercial banks as they have in some of the&#13;
non-bank financial intermediaries.&#13;
2.22      Even with an expanded IGLF program, the volume of lending that&#13;
can be undertaken will be small when compared to that which commercial&#13;
banks might undertake from their own resources. One of the objectives of&#13;
the IGLF program was to act as a catalyst to encourage lending by private&#13;
financial institutions to SSEs, by absorbing some of the early risks and&#13;
costs of developing term lending programs to small borrowers. Hence&#13;
it is important to address the constraints that prevent commercial banks&#13;
from lending their own resources to the SSE sector. Under the present&#13;
set-up, commercial banks are mobilizing resources for the well established&#13;
corporate sector only, 1/ and the banks appear to be incurring financial&#13;
losses in their attempt to develop a new SSE clientele. 2/&#13;
2.23      Precisely what steps are required to induce commercial banks to&#13;
lend to SSEs from their own resources merits a much closer examination of&#13;
interest rate and related policies than can be given in this report. The&#13;
present policies are effectively closing off the large majority of small&#13;
enterprises from access to an extremely large and rapidly growing volume&#13;
of resources raised through the extensive branch network of the commercial&#13;
banks. Essentially, the effective spreads need to be increased to make&#13;
lending to small enterprises more financially attractive. This could be&#13;
done through changes in interest rates, in service charges, or in tax incen-&#13;
tives; it need not involve subsidies.&#13;
2.24      Even with major reforms in the structure of financial incentives,&#13;
however, it is difficult to see the commercial banks voluntarily developing&#13;
an active lending program to SSEs using privately raised resources; for this&#13;
reason, we believe that any re-structuring of financial incentives should be&#13;
seen as a way of enhancing the present programs of the Government, not of&#13;
1/   Loans outstanding to single proprietorships in March 1978 amounted&#13;
to P 1.2 billion; to partnerships, co-operatives and associations,&#13;
P 0.8 billion; and to corporations, P 30.9 billion. Annex 1, Table 9.&#13;
2/   It was pointed out that the corporate sector may (and in fact does)&#13;
relend to SSEs, and that this might be an efficient way of approaching&#13;
(i.e. of lending to) them. We agree with this, but would add two points.&#13;
First, most SMIs serve local markets directly, drawing on local traders&#13;
and suppliers, many of whom are themselves small scale. For this rea-&#13;
son we later suggest, secnnd, that lending to small (and medium) scale&#13;
traders is also desirable (see Chapters 3 and 4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
displacing them. First, the experience of government and government-spon-&#13;
sored institutions shows that the costs and risks involved in lending to&#13;
SSEs are far greater than the commercial banks would be willing to undertake&#13;
even if appropriate interest rate adjustments were made. An important excep-&#13;
tion would be the larger sized category of small loans to enterprises with an&#13;
established track record and adequate collateral. This would, however, exclude&#13;
a large number of small enterprises, as the benefits of developing a small&#13;
enterprise program tend to accrue several years beyond the planning horizon&#13;
of commercial banks. Second, the possibility of institutional biases in favor&#13;
of lending to the corporate sector - both national and transnational - cannot&#13;
be dismissed lightly given the extent to which the commercial banks have&#13;
evolved in response to its demands. Third, the large majority of the owners&#13;
of SSEs are unaccustomed to, and untrained in, gaining access to and managing&#13;
institutional credit. This is why the extension programs and the pre-loan&#13;
services of the Government financing programs remain important.&#13;
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)&#13;
2.25      Background.   DBP was established in 1958 as an autonomous govern-&#13;
ment owned development bank with a mandate to supply long-term credit to the&#13;
leading sectors of the economy. At the end of 1978, DBP held 11.2% of the&#13;
assets of the financial system. DBP plays a major role in the Philippine&#13;
economy, being the largest supplier of long-term credit. As of June 30, 1978,&#13;
the proportion of loans going to industry, agriculture and real estate-were&#13;
64.8%, 14.4% and 15.2%, respectively. About 80% of industrial lending goes&#13;
to large industry with 10%, 6% and 4% going to medidm, small and home indus-&#13;
tries 1/ respectively. In addition to its direct lending, DBP lends indi-&#13;
rectly to home, small and medium industries through its association with the&#13;
private development banks (paras 2.38 et. seq.).&#13;
2.26      Sources and Cost of Funds.   As of December 31, 1978, long-term bor-&#13;
rowings, short-term borrowings (under one year), equity and deferred credits&#13;
accounted for 53.9%, 25.0%, 18.9% and 2.2%, respectively of DBP-s total re-&#13;
sources. Savings and time deposits with maturities of under one year consti-&#13;
tuted 66% of short-term borrowings. The weighted average cost of short-term&#13;
borrowings was ahout 8.0%. Long-term foreign borrowings comprised loans from&#13;
international institutions and commercial sources with a weighted average cost&#13;
of capital of 9.7%. Domestic long-term borrowings comprised bond issues,&#13;
notes from government and financial institutions, IBRD resources onlent by&#13;
the Government in local currency, and others. The weighted average costs of&#13;
these borrowings is 12.4%. This figure is likely to underestimate the true&#13;
1/   Home industry loans are loans of up to P 50,000; small industry loans&#13;
range from P 50,000-800,000; medium industry loans vary from P 800,000-&#13;
3.0 million, while large industry loans are in excess of P 3.0 million.&#13;

share capital might be viewed as a long-term debenture issue; the return on&#13;
DBP's Countryside Bonds is around 9%. 2/ If this is done, the weighted over-&#13;
all average cost of capital to DBP is around 9.9% p.a. As the cost of DBP's&#13;
deposits, equity and long-term domestic borrowings is likely to be under-&#13;
stated, the weighted average overall cost of capital should be seen as a&#13;
base-line figure.&#13;
2.27      Use of Return on Funds.   DBP's operations include loans, guarantees&#13;
and equity investments. In FY78, loans accounted for 59% of all DBP approvals.&#13;
The size of loans vary from a minimum of P 5,000 to over P 5 million. In&#13;
terms of sectoral allocation, industry, agriculture and real estate accounted&#13;
for 65%, 14% and 15%, respectively of all approvals. DBP-s industrial loans&#13;
alone will be considered below. In 1976, the weighted average return on&#13;
industrial loans outstanding was 10% while the weighted average cost of&#13;
resources at that time was 8.8%, resulting in a gross spread on industrial&#13;
lending of 1.2%. Administrative costs incurred by lending to industry were&#13;
estimated at 0.7% of industrial loans outstanding, leaving a margin of 0.5%&#13;
for provisions, write-offs 3/ and profits. The very small operating margin&#13;
has resulted in DBP making some changes in its lending policies; there were&#13;
also some concerns that cheap loans were making industrial investments too&#13;
capital intensive. The rate of interest on loans not secured by land mortgage&#13;
has been raised from 12% to 14% p.a. In addition, a supervision fee of 2% has&#13;
been introduced for all loans in excess of P 150,000. This has resulted in a&#13;
weighted average return of 13.5% for industrial loans less than P 150,000 and&#13;
15.5% for those above.   In FY78, less than 3% of DBP's industrial loans in&#13;
value terms were below P 150,000. Hence, its weighted average return on&#13;
lending is around 15.5%. Once these interest rates increases are reflected&#13;
in the return on industrial loans outstanding, DBP will be operating on a&#13;
gross margin of 5.6%. Even if administrative costs were to rise to 2% of&#13;
loans outstanding, it would still leave a margin of 3.6% to cover provisions/&#13;
write-offs and profits.&#13;
1/   Until January 1979, DBP bonds offered such privileged terms as tax exemp-&#13;
tion and reserve eligibility.&#13;
2/   The first three issues of DBP countryside bills offered an interest of&#13;
9% payable semiannually. In the fourth issue (January 1979), the Govern-&#13;
ment decided to remove the privileged features on DBP bonds; the average&#13;
effective cost of this issue to DBP was 14.69%.&#13;
3/   As of June 30, 1976, arrears on industrial loans were approximately 7.5%&#13;
of loans outstanding while the portfolio affected was 41.4%.&#13;

2.28      Lending to Home, Small and Medium Industries.    DBP currently has&#13;
a separate department to lend to these industries, the volume of lending&#13;
to which increased from P 48 million in 1974 to P 158 million in 1978&#13;
(Annex 1, Table 2.5). The growth was particularly fast during the first two&#13;
years during which time, however, a serious arrears problem began to develop&#13;
(para 2.29). Apart from making direct loans, DBP has a program which provides&#13;
Private Development Banks (PDB's) with equity and rediscounting facilities&#13;
(para 2.39), and which both widen the geographic reach of its own programs&#13;
and encourage private sector participation. 1/ The returns and costs to DBP&#13;
of lending to industry are given below:&#13;

Source: DBP (internal report-).&#13;
2.29      DBP receives net spreads of 5.3%, 3.0% and 2.2% respectively on its&#13;
loans for large, medium and small industries; the spreads are to cover over-&#13;
heads, profits, write-offs and provisions. The arrears position on the indus-&#13;
trial loans by loan size are shown in Annex 1, Table 2.6.    As expected, the&#13;
risks for large industry loans are significantly lower; 2/ in 1978 principal&#13;
1/   See paras. 2.39, et. seq.   Over the period 1974-78, DBP had rediscounted&#13;
3,000 industrial loans of the PDBs amounting to P 65 million, with an&#13;
average size of P 30,000. In contrast, DBP had, over the same period,&#13;
made 5,300 loans for P 650 million with an average loan size of&#13;
P 120,000.&#13;
2/   The arrears figures on large industry loans probably understate the&#13;
actual level of arrears as no account is taken of loans rescheduled by&#13;
DBP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
and interest in arrears as a proportion of loans outstanding amounted to 4.7%&#13;
and 20.9% for large and small respectively. Within the latter group, home&#13;
industry loans appear to be only slightly riskier than loans to small and&#13;
medium industries, though the level of arrears are high across the board.&#13;
The arrears on loans to the smaller industries, however, are significantly&#13;
lower (by a factor of four) in the branches than they are at head office;&#13;
arrears on branch office loans in 1976 varied between 5.6% and 11.8% of loans&#13;
outstanding, which was not significantly higher than arrears on loans to large&#13;
industry. The manager of DBP-s small and medium industry programs pointed out&#13;
(as had people in other financial institutions) that lending in small communi-&#13;
ties was often easier and less risky than leading out of the head office in&#13;
the Manila area as the branch staff have greater personal knowledge of the&#13;
local community and its enterprises. 1/&#13;
2.30      In the first year of the program, the arrears as a percentage of&#13;
loans outstanding were exceedingly high, but declined subsequently for several&#13;
reasons. A fast growth in the portfolio and a restructuring of loans at first&#13;
increased the share of loans in the grace period (up to six months for the&#13;
finance of fixed assets, before 1979), and also the share of young loans on&#13;
which arrears problems had not yet surfaced. But the size the portfolio&#13;
peaked in 1976 and then declined in 1977 and 1978, so that the share of young&#13;
loans and loans in the grace period declined. At the same time there were&#13;
noticeable declines in th'e arrears levels, reflecting changes in policies&#13;
and procedures as more experience was gained in lending to small enterprises.&#13;
The principal changes included intensified efforts in the training of staff; 2/&#13;
the development of stricter screening appraisal, supervision and loan collec-&#13;
tion procedures (all of which were associated with an increase of trained&#13;
staff); and the introduction of monitoring and control procedures to reduce&#13;
diversions of funds. Evaluation studies of problem accounts were also under-&#13;
taken.&#13;
2.31      Conclusions.   Considering the net spreads on the different types&#13;
of DBP lending, it is apparent that the profits made by lending to large&#13;
industries are absorbing some of the costs of lending to smaller industries.&#13;
In addition, small loans are more prone to arrears than are loans to large&#13;
industry. Despite the declining arrears rates, it is not profitable&#13;
for DBP to lend to small industries, but it continues to do&#13;
owing to the high priority placed by the Government on this form of lending.&#13;
The DBP experience has, however, shown that the initially high risks of lend-&#13;
ing to small enterprises can be reduced as experience is gained, and as decen-&#13;
tralizing decision making procedures for small loan approvals are introduced.&#13;
1/   Since these discussions were held in 1978-79, however, the arrears rates&#13;
in Manila have declined significantly, while those in the branches rose&#13;
(Annex Table 2.6).&#13;
2/   The institutional effort required to develop the program has been immense,&#13;
as can be gauged from the level and growth of professional and support&#13;
staff in DBP. Professional staff alone grew by nearly 50% from 1,900&#13;
to 2,800 in between 1976 and 1978, and total staff by 40% from 3,100 to&#13;
4,400.  See Annex 1, Table 2.7.&#13;
&#13;

Private Development Corporation of the Philippines&#13;
2.32      Background.   PDCP was established in 1963 and has been legally&#13;
defined as an investment house although its operations are those of a devel-&#13;
opment bank. PDCP is probably one of the only private financial institutions&#13;
to make long-term loans and provide pre-loan services to their SSE clients. 1/&#13;
A small business loan department was established in 1972 for this purpose.&#13;
Loans approved by PDCP classified by the asset size of the recipient enter-&#13;
prise is given in Annex 1, Table 2.8. The number of small enterprises financed&#13;
by PDCP increased sharply once PDCP received accreditation from IGLF in late&#13;
1976. The lower limit on PDCP loans is P 50,000; loans between P 50,000-&#13;
500,000 are considered to be small loans while loans above P 500,000 are&#13;
considered as regular loans. In the early stages of PDCP's small .industry&#13;
program most of the loans were in the Metro Manila area. Recently, both as&#13;
a result of PDCP's growing branch network and the Government's emphasis on&#13;
regional development, approximately 50% of the loans are to borrowers located&#13;
in the provinces.&#13;
2.33      Lending from PDCP's Own Resources.   The volume of small loans fi-&#13;
nanced by PDCP from its own resources has been relatively small, the major&#13;
constraint on PDCP for this type of lending being that long-term peso resources&#13;
are unavailable. At present PDCP is not allowed to accept deposits. Conse-&#13;
quently, the only way it can mobilize peso resources for onlending is either&#13;
by borrowing from other institutions or by issuing its own bonds. Given the&#13;
current interest rate structure it is not possible for PDCP to raise resources&#13;
through these mechanisms and earn an adequate spread by so doing. Hence, PDCP&#13;
concentrates on foreign currenty denominated loans; over the period 1963-78,&#13;
approximately 78% of PDCP's lending has been in foreign exchange. As most&#13;
small industries require local currency financing, PDCP is unable to finance&#13;
a significant volume of SSE loans from its own resources.&#13;
2.34      Recently, PDCP has been able to mobilize some medium-term peso&#13;
resources by issuing 1 to 5 year notes at around 15% to 16%. These resources&#13;
are on-lent at 19%. Owing to the different tax-incidence on the borrowing and&#13;
lending rate, the gross spread accruing to PDCP is not 3%, but nearer 5%. The&#13;
1/   A recent convention of small and medium business owners passed a resolu-&#13;
tion requesting other financial institutions to provide pre-loan services&#13;
similar to those now provided by PDCP. Philippines International Conven-&#13;
tion Center, Manila, May 27, 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
administrative cost of lending to SSE has been computed at 3% 1/ of loans&#13;
outstanding which leaves about 2% to cover provisions, write-offs and&#13;
defaults. 2/&#13;
2.35      Lending through IGLF Funds.   PDCP was accredited under the IGLF&#13;
program in 1976 and has been using IGLF resources to finance a significant&#13;
number of SSE projects; as of September 1978, 70% of the small industry loans&#13;
financed by PDCP were from IGLF funds. IGLF funds have been obtained at 7%&#13;
and were on-lent at 12% (excluding the guarantee fee). 3/ In addition PDCP&#13;
charged a one-time service fee of 1.5% giving a gross spread of 6.5% for the&#13;
first year and 5% subsequently. In order to maximize returns from its IGLF&#13;
operations PDCP has tended to concentrate on the larger of the small loans;&#13;
the average loan size having increased from P 175,000 ($25,000) in 1974&#13;
to P 370,000 ($50,000) in 1978. Exceptions are made when the enterprise&#13;
records are in good shape, in which case the administrative costs to PDCP are&#13;
much lower; 4/ this occurs for instance with second loans, which apparently&#13;
require half or less of the processing costs of first-time loans. 5/&#13;
1/   When the necessary project data is not available, PDCP's appraisers might&#13;
spend 4 to 6 weeks collecting it, a task which could cost as much as&#13;
P 6,000 (excluding overheads). A project analysis is then undertaken&#13;
which concentrates on the management, financial, technical and marketing&#13;
aspects of the projects. Despite the project analysis, all loans are&#13;
fully collateralized; for SMIs, land, buildings and machinery are valued&#13;
at 100%, 90% and 70% of appraised value respectively, and for large&#13;
industries at 80%, 70% and 60%.&#13;
2/   Katrine Anderson Saito and Dan P. Villanueva, "Transaction Costs of Credit&#13;
to the Small-Scale Sector in the Philippines."&#13;
3/   Recently the IGLF lending rates were revised.    For small industry loans&#13;
(from P 50,000 - P 800,000), participating institutions charge interest&#13;
at no less than 13.2% p.a. plus a service charge of 1.5% p.a. payable at&#13;
the time of loan; for medium industry loans (P 800,000 - P 2.5 million)&#13;
participating institutions are allowed a spread of 8% on small industry&#13;
loans and 6% on medium industry loans.&#13;
4/   PDCP head office and branch staff made the point that the services of&#13;
SBAC and MASICAP can be useful in reducing the administrative costs&#13;
simply by improving the records of the businesses, though they find that&#13;
it is still desirable for thieir own staff to continue to provide pre-&#13;
loan services and work with the proponent directly. PDCP staff often&#13;
give lectures to and participate in the seminars of the MASICAP and SBAC&#13;
field (extension) staff. In addition, PDCP run a training program for&#13;
project analysts.&#13;
5/   In the past, no single borrower could obtain more than P 500,000 from&#13;
IGLF resources. This prevented the borrower and the financing institu-&#13;
tion benefitting from these economies of scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
2.36      The arrears and defaults on PDCP's small loan portfolio have been&#13;
significantly lower than for other financial institutions. (Annex 1, T-9&#13;
shows the arrears position for both PDCP-s small and regular loans). For&#13;
small loans, principal in arrears over 3 months increased sharply from 3.7%&#13;
in 1975 to 8.2% in 1976 but fell to 3.9% in June 1978, largely as a result&#13;
of a substantial increase in PDCP's small loan portoflio and a corresponding&#13;
increase in loans in the grace period. If principal and interest in arrears&#13;
over 3 months is compared to principal outstanding in the repayment period&#13;
the improvement in the arrears situation is less dramatic but noticeable. 1/&#13;
In comparing small and regular loans in terms of arrears and defaults it is&#13;
apparent that on any criteria small loans have proved to be more risky.&#13;
While it is difficult to estimate the costs involved in rescheduling, write&#13;
offs and litigations, it appears that the net margin accruing to PDCP from&#13;
utilizing IGLF funds is not unprofitable.&#13;
2.37      Conclusions.   Since PDCP carries out project appraisals for both&#13;
its small and large loans, lending to small enterprises is more expensive&#13;
for PDCP than lending to large industries, owing to the higher administra-&#13;
tive costs in relation to loan size. By intensive efforts in appraisal and&#13;
supervision, PDCP has kept the risks of lending to SSEs relatively low, and&#13;
has made such lending profitable by concentrating on the larger of the small&#13;
industry loans (loans in excess of about P 100,000). Their lending is,&#13;
however, heavily dependent on IGLF, and the development of a lending program&#13;
out of privately raised resources is constrained by the general scarcity of&#13;
long-term peso resources in the economy.&#13;
Private Development Banks&#13;
2.38      Background.   Private Development Banks (PDBs) are financial inter-&#13;
mediaries constituted as stock corporations under the mortgage bank provisions&#13;
of the General Banking Act. PDBs were set up to provide decentralized credit&#13;
facilities to small agricultural and industrial enterprises that would not&#13;
otherwise have had access to long-term credit. 2/&#13;
2.39      Source and Cost of Funds.   As of June 1978, the total resources of&#13;
PDBs amounted to P 666.4 million; a summarized Balance Sheet of PDBs is given&#13;
in Annex 1, Table 2.3; deposit,.liabilities, borrowings and capital funds in&#13;
the form of share capital and retained earnings accounted for 57.5%, 22.6%&#13;
and 19.9%, respectively. The Central Bank permits PDBs to pay marginally&#13;
more on their deposits than is paid by commercial banks, and in 1978 they&#13;
were offering 7.5% on savings deposits and from 9% to over 12.5% on time&#13;
deposits, depending on maturity, leading to an overall weighted average cost&#13;
of deposits of about 8.8%. The share capital comes from private contributions&#13;
1/   The percentage of loans in arrears fell by two thirds in 1978.&#13;
2/   As of June 30, 1978, the 35 PDBs had 105 branch offices and employed&#13;
a staff of nearly 1,500.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
and contributions from the Government in the form of preferred shares held by&#13;
DBP and the Land Bank of the Philippines. The cost of share capital is dif-&#13;
ficult to estimate, however, since few PDBs have declared dividends and the&#13;
returns to primary shareholders is often in the form of higher salaries,&#13;
bonuses and fringe benefits. If share capital and retained earnings are&#13;
viewed as a long-term deposit with a risk element attached to it then the&#13;
minimum opportunity cost would be around 15%, resulting in an overall weighted&#13;
average cost of funds for PDBs of about 10.5%. If, on the other hand, the&#13;
cost of capital were computed on the basis of dividends actually paid, then&#13;
the cost of the share capital would be about 2% 1/ and the overall weighted&#13;
average cost of capital 6.8%.&#13;
2.40      Use of and Return on Funds.    As of June 1978, the total loans out-&#13;
standing to PDBs amounted to P 400 million, of which approximately one third&#13;
was in industry, somewhat over one third in agriculture and the remainder in&#13;
commerce, real estate and other sectors. Over the period 1973-78, PDBs made&#13;
over 10,000 loans to cottage and small industries as compared to 5,400 such&#13;
loans made by DBP, PDCP and IGLF together (Annex 1, Table 2.10). About 70%&#13;
(by number) of these loans were financed from the PDBs own resources, 29% from&#13;
the rediscounting facilities provided by DBP and the Central Bank, and a small&#13;
percentage by IGLF. Many PDB loans do not qualify for IGLF financing as they&#13;
are for less than P 50,000, which is the minimum acceptable IGLF loan size;&#13;
over the period January-June 1978, approximately half the industrial loans&#13;
made by PDBs were below P 20,000 but a few large loans resulted in an aver-&#13;
age loan size of P 40,000.&#13;
2.41      When lending from their own resources, the PDBs are allowed to&#13;
charge an interest rate of 19% on loans with a maturity of over 2 years,&#13;
resulting in a spread of 8.5% to 12.2%, depending on the assumption made&#13;
about the cost of their share capital. The average administrative costs on&#13;
all operations were computed at about 4.4% of loans outstanding. 2/ It is&#13;
not known by how much the administrative costs of industrial loans exceed this&#13;
average, but they appear to be kept to minimal levels by basing appraisals&#13;
on the borrower's ability to meet collateral requirements 3/ and a personal&#13;
knowledge of the "character" of the client. 4/ Some PDB officers interviewed&#13;
1/   The low return on capital has made it difficult for PDBs to raise addi-&#13;
tional resources from the private sector.&#13;
2/   The low return on capital has made it difficult for PDBs to raise addi-&#13;
tional resources from the private sector.&#13;
3/   The General Bank Act requires PDBs to accept only real estate and high&#13;
grade investments as collateral. In addition, the loan collateral value&#13;
of various types of investments is also stipulated.&#13;
4/   Several managers interviewed said that this is often first acquired&#13;
through the businesses becoming depositors in the branches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
said that they would not lend to people they did not know well; as with the&#13;
DBP branch staff, they benefit from having a good working knowledge of the&#13;
local communities and enterprises. For these reasons, the administrative&#13;
costs appear .to be well within the spreads estimated above. The arrears,&#13;
however, amounted to 10% of principal outstanding in 1978; but the conserva-&#13;
tive valuing of collateral has resulted in the PDBs having minimal write offs.&#13;
2.42      The spreads on loans rediscounted with DBP vary, since the extent&#13;
of the rediscounting varies between 50% and 100% depending on the size of the&#13;
loan and the economic sector of the business. On a fully rediscounted loan,&#13;
the rediscounting rate is 12%, including a 2% service charge to DBP, giving&#13;
the PDBs a gross spread of 7%.&#13;
2.43      IGLF loans-made by most PDBs have been subject to high arrears; in&#13;
1978 principal and interest in arrears on IGLF loans as a proportion of loans&#13;
outstanding amounted to 30%. (The rural banks have run into similar diffi-&#13;
culties with IGLF, as will be discussed below.) Several explanations have&#13;
been offered for the high arrears and for the inability of the PDBs (and the&#13;
rural banks) to bring them down. A possible explanation is that IGLF has&#13;
involved the PDBs in a scale of lending that was outside the capacity of all&#13;
but a few banks to handle, with the average IGLF loan being ten or more times&#13;
the average loan made out of their own resources. As a result, a different&#13;
and more substantive approach to loan appraisal and supervision was required&#13;
and the smaller PDBs were unable to structure their policies accordingly.&#13;
2.44      Conclusion'.  The PDBs are a well adapted and an effective channel&#13;
for handling large numbers of very small loans with relatively low adminis-&#13;
trative costs; the arrears are still quite high, however, and a greater input&#13;
into the development of the institutions is required to achieve significant&#13;
reductions. The PDBs are thus filling a void in the credit market by making&#13;
loans to the smaller end of the SSE distribution, and enjoy an advantage over&#13;
large institutions, such as PDCP and the private investment houses,.derived&#13;
from their personal knowledge of the local communities. This advantage is&#13;
less applicable, however, when it comes to making large SSE loans for which&#13;
the appraisal procedures employed by PDCP and other similar institutions&#13;
are better suited.&#13;
Rural Banks&#13;
2.45      Background.   A rural bank is a locality specific unit bank.   There&#13;
are currently 960 individual rural banks which are privately owned but heavily&#13;
dependent on Central Bank funds. The Government has used the rural banks to&#13;
implement many of its rural credit programs, such as Masagana 99 and Masagana&#13;
Maisan for rice and corn production respectively. Despite their wide network,&#13;
at the end of 1978 rural banks contributed only 2.5% to the total resources of&#13;
the financial system.&#13;

2.46      Sources and Cost of Funds.   As of December 31, 1978, the total re-&#13;
sources of rural banks amounted to P 4,037.2 million. A summarized Balance&#13;
Sheet for Rural Banks is given in Annex Table 2.3. Borrowings (primarily from&#13;
the Central Bank), deposits, other liabilities and paid-in capital and reserves&#13;
accounted for 47.8%, 33.6%, 3.1% and 15.6%, respectively, of total resources.&#13;
Borrowing by rural banks comprise special savings and time deposits, and bills&#13;
and loans payable. A large proportion of these borrowings come from the Cen-&#13;
tral Bank to finance particular programs and are secured by promissory notes&#13;
from the recipient banks. In 1977, the weighted average cost of these borrow-&#13;
ings was around 2% p.a., reflecting the large volume of low-cost Central Bank&#13;
funds in the borrowings of rural banks. As of January 1977, no interest was&#13;
paid by rural banks on demand deposits; saving deposits offered 7.5% p.a.&#13;
while the return on time deposits varied from 9% to 12.5%. The weighted&#13;
average cost of deposits was 6.3%. The paid-in share capital of rural banks&#13;
comprise common stock and government-owned preferred stock. Inadequate data&#13;
on dividends paid makes it difficult to compute the cost of capital for rural&#13;
banks. In an opportunity cost sense, the share capital could be seen as being&#13;
equivalent to a long-term deposit. On this basis, the cost of its capital has&#13;
been estimated at 15% p.a., resulting in a weighted overall cost of capital of&#13;
around 6% p.a.&#13;
2.47.     Use of and Return on Funds.   Approximately 83% of the assets of the&#13;
rural banks are in the form of loans. Of the loans granted in 1978, 86.8%&#13;
went to agriculture, 8.7% to commerce, 2.7% to industry and 1.8% to others.&#13;
In terms of maturity, approximately 90% or more of rural bank loans are short&#13;
term; medium - and long-term being confined almost entirely to loans financed&#13;
under the Central Bank/IBRD program. The rate of return on loans outstanding&#13;
to agriculture, commerce, industry and others was 7.4%, 8.9%, 4.8% and 9.0%,&#13;
respectively for 1978, resulting in an overall weighted return on the rural&#13;
bank loan portfolio of 7.8% for 1978. Administrative costs for rural banks&#13;
were computed at 3.6% for 1976, leaving a negative margin of 1.8% 1/ even&#13;
before considering provisions, write-offs and profits.&#13;
2.48      Lending to SSE..  In theory, rural banks could operate as ideal out-&#13;
lets of small loans as they have a wide geographical coverage; in practice,&#13;
however, they have made very few loans.except to agro-related cottage indus-&#13;
tries such as fisheries, piggeries and poultry. As outlets for IGLF resources,&#13;
they have not been particularly successful: by the end of 1978, arrears as a&#13;
proportion of IGLF loans outstanding amounted to 55%. A possible reason for&#13;
the high level of arrears on IGLF loans is that in their normal course of&#13;
business, RB make short-term production-credit type agricultural loans while&#13;
IGLF loans were essentially long-term industrial loans; in additinn, the aver-&#13;
age size of an RB loan out of non-IGLF resources is less than one-tenth of&#13;
the size of loan they were typically expected to handle under the IGLF scheme.&#13;
Consequently, IGLF loans required a different type of appraisal which RBs did&#13;
1/   If instead of imputing a value to the cost of capital, it were derived&#13;
of the basis of dividends actually paid, then there is likely to be a&#13;
substantial reduction in the cost of capital to rural banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
not have the institutional expertise to undertake. 1/ The rural banks also&#13;
had a major responsibility for administering the agricultural credit programs&#13;
(Massagana 99), which severely strained their capacity to implement other&#13;
programs.&#13;
2.49      Conclusions:   Loans made by RBs have tended to finance agriculture&#13;
or agro-related industries. The RB loan portoflio has been faced with high&#13;
arrears; as-of December 31, 1975 arrears amounted to 21.4% of their outstanding&#13;
portfolio.  These figures, however, underestimate the true level of arrears&#13;
since short-term loans are frequently restructured so that arrears are held&#13;
below the 25% limit established by the CB as the rediscounting eligibility&#13;
criterion. In addition, medium - and long-term loans made by RB are not&#13;
deemed to be "in arrears", irrespective of the repayment performance, until&#13;
after the maturity of the loan. IGLF loans to SSE channeled through RB have&#13;
also faced high arrears, the long-term nature of the loan and the larger loan&#13;
size serving to increase the likelihood of arrears.&#13;
Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries 2/&#13;
2.50      Background.   Non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) comprise&#13;
institutions such as private insurance companies, finance companies, invest-&#13;
ment houses, and Government sponsored insurance programs. Private insurance&#13;
companies make few loans to industry. When loans are made they need, by law,&#13;
to be completely secured by real estate or by an iron clad commercial bank or&#13;
parent company guarantee. Consequently, no lending is undertaken by private&#13;
insurance companies to SSEs. The finance companies tend to be subsidiaries&#13;
of commercial banks and are primarily engaged in financing consumer durables&#13;
and provide short and medium term finance to local manufacturers and traders.&#13;
The investment houses also appear to provide a limited amount of financing to&#13;
industry.&#13;
2.51      Lending-by Finance Companies and Investment Houses to SSE.    Two-&#13;
finance companies and two investment houses were interviewed. 3/ Two of&#13;
the four institutions stated that they had made short-term loans (180 days&#13;
to 1 year) for working capital financing. Even the short-term loans had&#13;
gone to well-established on-going businesses which had, over time, developed&#13;
a relationship with the NBFI concerned.&#13;
1/   It was pointed out to us by Mrs. Mijares that the floor limit on IGLF&#13;
probably raised the risks by limiting the options of the RBs (and the&#13;
PDBs), who can manage very small loans efficiently.&#13;
2/   While the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines is defined&#13;
as an investment house it is not included in this section as it operates&#13;
as a development bank and has been discussed above.&#13;
3/   The two finance companies were Manphil Investment Corporation and Multi-&#13;
national Capital Corporation. The two investment houses were Ayala In-&#13;
vestment and Development Corporation and Bancom Development Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
2.52      None of the institutions had made term-loans to SSEs from their&#13;
own resources. There was considerable reluctance to lend to SSEs. It was&#13;
pointed out that the administrative costs per unit lent to SSEs was signifi-&#13;
cantly greater than to their established customers. 1/ Processing time and&#13;
cost were particularly high as it was difficult to obtain information on the&#13;
SSE and its credit standing. For this reason, loans were only made to enter-&#13;
prises with a proven track record and which could provide collateral at least&#13;
equal to the size of the loan. In addition to the cost of loan processing the&#13;
NBFI's claimed not to have the necessary institutional expertise to undertake&#13;
term-lending.&#13;
2.53      The experience of NBFIs using IGLF funds for onlending has been&#13;
,mixed. Most NBFI's complained about the red tape involved in dealing with&#13;
IGLF, and argued that the high level of arrears on their lending through IGLF&#13;
would be tolerable if the loan ceiling were raised, the guarantee feature&#13;
improved and the red tape reduced. 2/&#13;
2.54      To conclude, NBFIs to date have been averse to lending to SSE.&#13;
While in some instances short-term loans are being made the volume of such&#13;
lending is insignificant while the volume of term lending is non-existent.&#13;
1/   According to one estimate the direct cost of processing an SSE loan&#13;
varied between P 7,500 - P 12,000.&#13;
2/   Most of the suggestions have been incorporated in the recent IGLF loan.&#13;

3. EXPERIENCE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: (B) CONCLUSIONS&#13;
3.1       In the preceeding analysis, three categories of lending were con-&#13;
sidered: lending by-the private sector institutions out of own resources;&#13;
lending directly undertaken by the Government owned Development Bank of the&#13;
Philippines, and indirectly through equity finance and rediscounting facili-&#13;
ties provided to.the Private Development Banks; and lending by private sector&#13;
institutions using the Government's rediscounting facility (the Industrial&#13;
Guarantee and Loan Fund) for term-loans to small industries.&#13;
3.2       Privately Raised Resources: Private sector financial institutions&#13;
in the Philippines make few loans and even -fewer term loans out of their own&#13;
resources to small enterprises. Commercial banks, which are the largest&#13;
source of institutional credit in the country, go in principally for short-&#13;
term loans, undertaking very little medium- or long-term lending. The reluct-&#13;
ance to lend long-term can be explained partly by the interest rate structure&#13;
and the banks' adherence to the "golden rule" of matching maturities between&#13;
borrowing and lending. Under the present system, the maximum effective&#13;
interest rates on short-term (up to 2 years) and long-term loans (over 2&#13;
years) have been administratively set at 16% and 19% respectively. The&#13;
weighted average costs of resources to commercial banks is currently 13.3%,&#13;
but would be higher if a greater volume of long-term resources were to be&#13;
raised. The spreads between borrowing and lending rates are about 2.7% on&#13;
short-term loans; something in excess of this for short-term loans that are&#13;
rolled over, allowing for the service fees and other charges involved; and&#13;
probably not much over 3% for long-term loans, allowing for the higher costs&#13;
of raising long term resources. Considering the greater administrative costs,&#13;
project risks and environmental uncertainties of lending long, the banks are&#13;
finding it more profitable to lend short. The economy wide shortage of&#13;
long-term peso resources is also affecting the privately-owned development&#13;
finance companies and nonbank financial intermediaries, who traditionally&#13;
concentrate more than the commercial banks on long-term finance.&#13;
3.3       The interest rate structure, aside from encouraging short-term&#13;
lending, discourages lending to SSEs. Prime customers are charged marginally&#13;
below the maximum rates permitted while creditworthy, near-prime customers are&#13;
charged the maximum. In addition to the nominal return on loans, both prime&#13;
and near-prime customers bring in compensating business which increases the&#13;
effective return on loans made to them. Given that most SSEs bring in little&#13;
compensating business but are charged the same nominal interest rate, the&#13;
effective rate of return on SSE loans is lower than on loans made to near-&#13;
prime companies. In addition to the effective return being lower, the admin-&#13;
istrative cost per unit lent are significantly higher on SSE loans. All the&#13;
financial institutions interviewed stated that the cost and time involved in&#13;
processing a loan for an SSE, without an established track record, would be&#13;
about 2.4% to 3.0% of the loan value as compared to 0.4% and 0.5% for prime&#13;
and near prime companies respectively. The higher administrative cost results&#13;
in a lower net spread to the institution. In addition, the risks of arrears&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
and write-offs on SSE loans are higher than on loans to well established&#13;
enterprises. Consequently, in terms of both return and risk there is little&#13;
incentive currently for private financial institutions to lend to SSEs out&#13;
of their own resources. When loans are made by private financial institutions&#13;
to SSE's they tend to go to a small minority of entrepreneurs with adequate&#13;
collateral and an established relationship with the financial institution&#13;
concerned.&#13;
3.4       Lending to SSEs through private sector resources will therefore&#13;
require greater financial incentives than are currently available; changes in&#13;
the effective spreads through changes in the interest rate structures, service&#13;
charges and tax rates are obvious possibilities. But as argued in the text,&#13;
changes in financial incentives are needed to enhance the present programs,&#13;
not displace them. The Government's programs have shown that the risks and&#13;
arrears of lending to SSE are far higher than commercial banks would normally&#13;
accept. Although there has been a reduction in arrears over the past 5 years,&#13;
it is clear that the returns from developing a small enterprise clientele lie&#13;
beyond the planning horizons of financial institutions in the private sector.&#13;
A comparison of the experiences of the different institutions involved in&#13;
implementing the programs reveals at least five reasons why risks are ini-&#13;
tially high:&#13;
(i) Purely irreducible and random factors;&#13;
(ii) Term loans to the larger sizes of small and medium industries&#13;
being outside the scope and specialization of some private&#13;
sector institutions (the smaller rural banks and PDBs);&#13;
(iii) Internal and external diversions and misuses of funds&#13;
until control procedures have been fully developed;&#13;
(iv) The shortage of information on small enterprises and the&#13;
absence of a formal record-keeping system on credit worthi-&#13;
ness; related to this is the point that the abilities and&#13;
other qualities of owners are broadly distributed, 1/ leading&#13;
to difficulties in distinguishing between sound and unsound&#13;
loan requests until sufficient information and experience have&#13;
been gained; and&#13;
(v) The tasks of training staff and of developing screening, appraisal&#13;
and supervision procedures.&#13;
The last three items each involve high fixed costs and economies of scale in&#13;
developing the lending programs. While the traditional economics argument&#13;
would be to let interest rates rise to reflect costs, there are difficulties&#13;
in implementing it in practice. Higher interest rates for loans to small than&#13;
to large borrowers might be subject to political charges of discrimination.&#13;
1/   This same characteristic also leads to high turnover rates of small&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Even if interest rates went to high levels, this could raise doubts within&#13;
the institutions about the capacity of SSEs to service debts; that is, supply&#13;
curves could be backward sloping. 1/&#13;
3.5       Allowing for these factors makes it difficult to decide what mix&#13;
of incentives is appropriate, and for this reason we have merely raised the&#13;
issue. One obvious possibility is the adoption of mandatory ('forced balance&#13;
sheet-) measures to back up any shifts in financial incentives. But such&#13;
methods are themselves easily circumvented without extensive controls and&#13;
monitoring procedures. An alternative would be to encourage a small but&#13;
select number of financial institutions to develop a long-term interest in&#13;
small enterprise lending and derive benefits from economies of scale; IGLF was&#13;
of course conceived with this in mind, except that it has been spread thinly&#13;
across a large number of institutions in practice. 2/ The development of a&#13;
long term interest, however, would still require adjustments in the financial&#13;
incentives.&#13;
3.6       Government Programs:   (a) The Larger Small Industry Loans.   Since&#13;
private sector financing is not available, there is almost exclusive reliance&#13;
on the Government's programs. The lending rates on loans made through these&#13;
programs to small enterprises are below the 19% ceiling rates, 3/ but the&#13;
spreads accruing to the financial institution have not been sacrificed as the&#13;
funds were made available at less than the market rate.&#13;
3.7       Some commercial banks had found IGLF loans to be profitable, but&#13;
only by accepting highly creditworthy clients with solid collateral, and have&#13;
in consequence made very few loans. On the other hand, non-Bank financial&#13;
intermediaries such as PDCP have made a greater number of loans, but concen-&#13;
trated on the larger end of the small enterprise size distribution, with loan&#13;
sizes averaging over P350,000 (in 1978); the service charges 4/ enabled them&#13;
to put substantial effort into screening, pre-loan services, loan appraisal&#13;
and supervision. Analysis of the experience of other institutions, including&#13;
DBP, shows that such screening procedures are necessary if risks are to be&#13;
kept down. In the IGLF program, institutions with high arrears tended to be&#13;
those which did not have much past experience in term lending. In the case of&#13;
the Rural Banks and the smaller Private Development Banks, the IGLF loan sizes&#13;
were also several times greater than those of their normal loans, and they&#13;
were unable to appraise and supervise them appropriately.&#13;
I/   A comment made to us by Naburo Kawai.&#13;
2/   Concentrating on a few institutions would also make IGLF easier to&#13;
monitor.&#13;
3/   With the exception of loans made by the PDBs, and rediscounted by DBP&#13;
and the Central Bank. On DBP loans the rate charges is 15.5% while on&#13;
IGLF it was 13.2% as of December 1978 (the latter was recently raised&#13;
to 14.2%).&#13;
4/   These work out at about 2% of loan amount, regardless of loan size.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
3.8       One of the achievements of the program has been the development of&#13;
project-lending procedures within DBP and some private sector institutions&#13;
(such as PDCP). The immediate aim is to develop these further and, in the&#13;
case of IGLF, to involve private sector institutions selectively. Given the&#13;
difficulties encountered in the first five years of the program, and the&#13;
progress made in developing procedures, a forum for the exchange of views&#13;
and experience between institutions seems desirable; the establishment of&#13;
a common credit-record keeping system (for both private and Government pro-&#13;
gram loans) would also help.&#13;
3.9       Loans to small enterprises continue to be prone to high arrears,&#13;
however, and a rapid rate of decline seems unlikely given the poor state&#13;
of records in and information on small enterprises 1/ - or more generally,&#13;
the difficulties of servicing a diverse and largely unknown clientele. One&#13;
method employed by DBP and IGLF to cushion the losses is to blend the small&#13;
industry programs with lending to medium-scale industries so as to increase&#13;
the return and reduce the overall risk on the institution's SME portfolio. In&#13;
addition, it permits the financial institution to make second loans to expand-&#13;
ing enterprises (loans to enterprises with track-records are much less risky).&#13;
3.10      Government Programs:   (b) Cottage (or Home) Industry Loans.   The&#13;
formalized screening and appraisal procedures discussed above are too costly&#13;
to apply to small loans (of less than p 50-100 thousand), so simpler proce-&#13;
dures have been adopted by DBP and the PDBs, who are the only institutions&#13;
offering term-loans to home industries. 2/ Loans are made at the branch&#13;
level on the basis of character, collateral, and a personal knowledge of the&#13;
local enterprises. The experience so far is that such procedures have cut&#13;
both administrative costs and risks: arrears are significantly lower in the&#13;
provinces (by a factor of four in the case of DBP); 3/ and the administrative&#13;
costs are within the gross spreads estimated above. The branch networks of&#13;
DBP and the PDBs have thus proved to be low cost and relatively low risk&#13;
channels for handling a large number of small loans to home industries. The&#13;
PDBs have also lent quite extensively out of privately raised resources, 4/&#13;
principally savings and time deposits.&#13;
3.11      Cottage (or home) industries in the Philippines are defined to&#13;
include small manufacturing establishments and workshops with assets of up to&#13;
P 100,000. (The term is thus a misnomer, since these activities are not in&#13;
the home.) As noted in the introduction, there are over 70,000 such establish-&#13;
ments, which are one of the most rapidly growing sources of employment and&#13;
1/   Which is why the MASICAP program and the pre-loan services of PDCP are&#13;
so important.&#13;
2/   PNB also have a cottage industry loans facility, but it is not actively&#13;
promoted.&#13;
3/   The small industry loans of DBP also had similarly lower arrears in the&#13;
provinces.&#13;
4/   For reasons discussed above, the weighted average cost of resources&#13;
to PDB is lower than for other banks. Consequently the gross spread&#13;
accruing to PDBs is higher than would normally be the case.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
earnings opportunities in the country. (Manufacturing employment in households&#13;
has peaked and probably started to decline.) DBP and PDBs currently lend to&#13;
this sector. However, the reliance on DBP and PDBs for home industry loans&#13;
limits the geographical coverage of the program, and its ability to cater to a&#13;
growing demand. The floor limit of P50,000 on IGLF loans also effectively&#13;
closes off this channel to home industries. If the limit were removed, and&#13;
accompanied by appropriate simplications in loan procedures for "home" industry&#13;
loans, the branch networks of the commercial banks could prove to be ideal&#13;
outlets; as with the DBP- branches and the PDBs, commercial bank branches&#13;
benefit from a close knowledge of their local communities and businesses.&#13;
3.12      Government Programs:   (c) Working Capital Finance.   Since the&#13;
programs concentrate on the finance of fixed assets and permanent working&#13;
capital, we have so far not discussed working capital finance for small&#13;
enterprises.  At this point it might be useful to ancitipate some findings on&#13;
the subject reached in the next Chapter. This entails duplication; but the&#13;
issues are sufficiently important to warrant it, and were raised both during&#13;
interviews with the enterprise owners themselves and by the staff involved in&#13;
the program. The first finding is that the demands of small industries for&#13;
the finance of working capital are probably as great as those for the finance&#13;
of fixed assets. The historical experience of the industrialized countries,&#13;
and the current (if sketchy) evidence from developing countries, indicates&#13;
that more than half of the asset structure of small and medium industries is&#13;
made up of working capital. 1/ Second, to finance fixed assets only, without&#13;
tailoring the financial package such that subsequent' access to short-term&#13;
finance is guaranteed, places a financial stress on the business, and increases&#13;
risks, by leaving it with high overheads and a limited ability to respond to&#13;
changes in orders. Financing 'permanent' working capital does not provide for&#13;
this since it is concerned only with minimum levels of inventories and cash&#13;
reserves, not with needs resulting from day-to-day changes in sales and pur-&#13;
chases. Third, because it can be related to current sales levels and con-&#13;
tracts, working capital finance is inherently less risky. Fourth, it is also&#13;
more likely to involve the commercial banks in the program.&#13;
3.13      For these reasons we have suggested that the provision of working&#13;
capital finance ought to form a point of departure for the future of the pro-&#13;
gram. The point was also made that the most effective - though by no means&#13;
exclusive - channels for working capital finance in industry are trading&#13;
firms, which provide the further advantage of coupling the finance with access&#13;
to markets, reducing risks all round. In the interests of providing small&#13;
industries with improved access to finance and markets, therefore, it seems&#13;
desirable to expand the scope of the program to cover small (and medium)&#13;
enterprises, in the general sense that we have defined the term in Chapter 1.&#13;
1/   Kennett (1979).   Working capital includes the value of materials and&#13;
supplies, work in process, finished products in stock, cash reserves&#13;
and accounts receivable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
3.14      Postscript:  Further Changes in 1979.   The interviews on which the&#13;
above analysis was based were conducted with twenty institutions in November&#13;
1978. There have naturally been some changes since then, all of which, how-&#13;
ever, confirm the general conclusions reached above. Supplementary interviews&#13;
were undertaken with six institutions at head and branch office levels in&#13;
November 1979. The weighted average cost of resources had risen from 13.3%&#13;
to close to 16% during the year (one institution was actually using a shadow&#13;
price of 16% for planning purposes), on account of the pressure on short-term&#13;
resources brought about by falling sugar prices and rising oil prices on the&#13;
balance of payments. The effects on lending to SSEs were (predictably) a&#13;
substantial cut-back on both current and planned lending, and a readiness to&#13;
lend, on the part of the accredited financial institutions, only through the&#13;
Government's IGLF program. One other private financial institution (Allied&#13;
Banking Corporation) had begun to develop specialization in term-lending&#13;
through IGLF, more or less in lines with arguments set out above, and in&#13;
parallel to the efforts of PDCP.&#13;
3.15      Summing up.   The Government's programs are providing an increasing&#13;
number of small enterprises with access to institutional credit, and they have&#13;
shown that the administrative costs and risks of lending to small enterprises&#13;
can be reduced with experience and as appropriate screening procedures are&#13;
developed within the institutions. But the volume of lending is small com-&#13;
pared to both the demand for credit by small enterprises and the resources of&#13;
the private financial sector. The structural constraints preventing private&#13;
financial institutions from lending out of their own resources to SSEs will&#13;
have to be eliminated if financial institutions are to build on the experience&#13;
gained through the Government s programs.&#13;
&#13;

4. INDUSTRIAL EXTENSION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
4.1       In parallel with the financing programs for small and medium indus-&#13;
tries, the Government introduced in 1974 two kinds of industrial extension&#13;
service, both run by the Ministry of Industry. One offers assistance in the&#13;
preparation of projects for finance out of the enterprises' own resources or&#13;
by the financial institutions, and the other a range of entrepreneurial&#13;
counselling and other advisory services. The former is known as MASICAP&#13;
(the Medium and Small Scale Industries Coordinated Action Program) 1/ and the&#13;
latter as the SBAC (Small Business Advisory Centers') program. The two are&#13;
administered under one department and share the same field offices. This&#13;
Chapter reviews the activities of the programs over their first five years&#13;
and considers the questions:-&#13;
-    what has been the demand for the services offered?&#13;
-    what are the costs and the nature 2/ of the economic&#13;
benefits in providing them?&#13;
-    in what ways might the services be improved?&#13;
-   -is the private sector providing them also and, if so,&#13;
what is the role of the Government's programs?&#13;
4.2       The last question is often raised in connection with government-&#13;
sponsored extension programs, and a discussion of it in a Philippine context&#13;
helps to provide some clarifications. What is at issue is less whether the&#13;
services in themselves are sought by small enterprises (though there is&#13;
surprisingly little known about the extent of the demand) but whether they&#13;
need to be provided through government programs.    Further, given the large&#13;
number, the geographical spread and the heterogeneity of small enterprises&#13;
there is also the issue of whether they can in fact be serviced effectively&#13;
without great expense and establishing a large bureaucracy. The findings are&#13;
summarized in the concluding section.&#13;
4.3       While the following analysis concentrates exclusively on the Ministry&#13;
of Industry's programs it should be added that several other Government agen-&#13;
cies offer services to small enterprises. Their activities have not been&#13;
reviewed here because the task would be too long. They have been documented&#13;
in a thesis by Chico (1976) and more recently in a study by the University&#13;
of the Philippines' Institute for Small-Scale Industries (1979). The various&#13;
agencies are represented on a Comission for Small and Medium Industries, which&#13;
1/   In 1980 the services provided under the MASICAP program were formally&#13;
taken over by SBAC. For convenience, and since the following analysis&#13;

4.4       Background.   The idea that led to the MASICAP program can be&#13;
summed up by noting that small enterprises, like financial institutions,&#13;
face transactions costs (risks and administrative costs) in obtaining loans.&#13;
Moreover, the poor shape of their records raises the transactions costs to the&#13;
institutions.   Before the extension programs were introduced in 1974, lending&#13;
facilities were already available to small enterprises, but had been little&#13;
used in practice. The reasons given were "(a) that the institutions had not&#13;
developed the capability of handling a large volume of small loans to small&#13;
industry, and (b) the majority of small industries, having previously had no&#13;
access to institutional credit, were unable, at least initially, to exploit&#13;
this new resource properly and fully." With the introduction of term-lending&#13;
facilities in 1974, transactions costs to both borrowers and lenders were&#13;
expected to rise further since project analyses (involving forecasts of cash&#13;
flows) were considered to be necessary for all except small projects and&#13;
businesses of good standing. The idea was to absorb at least part of the&#13;
transactions costs in the extension program, since the extension workers could&#13;
undertake much of the preparatory work in submitting projects to the banks:&#13;
in doing so they could also serve an educational purpose of disseminating&#13;
ideas about business management practices and information on production&#13;
methods. The theory was that once the preparatory work had been done success-&#13;
fully once for an enterprise, the transactions costs would be permanently&#13;
reduced on both sides; furthermore, with increasing numbers of projects&#13;
financed, there would be a greater willingness on the part of the institu-&#13;
tions - provided the program had generated a satsifactory proportion of&#13;
successful projects - to finance small enterprises independently of MASICAP.&#13;
4.5       The program was in fact designed not to be a permanent aspect&#13;
of the Government's programs. It was also intended to be educational in&#13;
itself, and a means of supplying public and private institutions with&#13;

experienced field workers having a knowledge of the workings of small busi-&#13;
nesses. The extension workers are given two year appointments, and practically&#13;
all are recruited by financial institutions, industry or other government&#13;
agencies on leaving the program. 1/&#13;
4.6       The program covers all regions outside Metropolitan Manila, in&#13;
accordance with the regional objectives mentioned in Chapter 2. In the first&#13;
five and a half years, project studies had been completed for 5,000 busi-&#13;
nesses 2/ and submitted for financing. The annual volume of projects pre-&#13;
pared has fallen somewhat in recent years as the extension workers have begun&#13;
to work increasingly in the towns and villages away from the regional centers.&#13;
The decision to finance is at the sole discretion of the financing institu-&#13;
tions, who have so far 3/ approved 50% of the projects submitted; 24% were&#13;
withdrawn or rejected after a preliminary screening, and 6% were disapproved&#13;
after full appraisal; on account of long queuing and processing times (to be&#13;
discussed further below), about 20% are still awaiting decision. 4/&#13;
4.7       In practice, it is the smaller and more uncertain cases that are&#13;
generally referred to or identified by the extension workers.    As discussed&#13;
in Chapter 2, the private financial institutions using IGLF offer preloan&#13;
1/   A key feature of the staffing policies is the recruitment of senior&#13;
students with outstanding academic records from,colleges and universi-&#13;
ties; they may substitute some course work for field work in the program.&#13;
In 1978 the MASICAP staff totalled 147, of whom 134 were field staff on&#13;
two year appointments, and only 4 (all at headquarters) were permanent.&#13;
Since then a core of regular and experienced staff have been recruited&#13;
in each of the 12 field offices to supervize the extension work and&#13;
introduce more maturity and continuity in the program. Training of the&#13;
extension workers is provided through lectures from representatives of&#13;
various public and private financial institutions, government agencies&#13;
and the senior extension workers.&#13;
This staffing policy was in part a compromise, since it was necessary&#13;
to recruit people "(a) willing to live and work in rural areas and towns,&#13;
and (b) with the technical ability to identify promising projects and&#13;
turn them into bankable propositions. At the beginning of the program&#13;
the first qualification was considered more crucial than the second.&#13;
Moreover, it was expected that the banks would provide the quality&#13;
control through appraisal." These descriptions, together with the one&#13;
quoted in the previous paragraph, were provided by Joe Pernia.&#13;

services to the larger of the small enterprises requesting loans upwards of&#13;
about P 100-150 thousand, for which the service costs, as a percentage of&#13;
loan amounts, are relatively low; loans in this size range have so far formed&#13;
practically all of their portfolios. About 75% of MASICAP projects are for&#13;
less than P 150 thousand, and 46% for less than P 50 thousand 1/ (Annex 1&#13;
Table 4.2). The large majority (96%) are also single proprietorships, employ-&#13;
ing less than 20 workers at the time of loan requests; in comparison, between&#13;
one half and two thirds of the enterprises financed independently of MASICAP&#13;
are incorporated. 2/&#13;
4.8       Before turning to issues facing the program, one other aspect of the&#13;
extensionists work that merits comment is the heterogeneity of businesses&#13;
encountered; it is this that necessitates an independent technical and finan-&#13;
cial analysis of each case. Small enterprises are found in practically all&#13;
sectors of industrial activity, 3/ and may differ in technical and financial&#13;
respects even within narrowly defined industrial sectors. In contrast to&#13;
agricultural projects, it is not possible to consider different scales of&#13;
activity, make an assessment of the cash flows and business budgets for&#13;
various technology packages, and determine the economic and financial merits&#13;
of a program of inputs for a region; even the market outlets and sources of&#13;
material supply may differ between businesses that are otherwise similar, 4/&#13;
some for instance concentrating on local and others on national or export&#13;
markets. Industrial extension presents difficulties fundamentally different&#13;
to (though certainly not greater than) those found in agricultural extension.&#13;
The costs of industrial extension are also raised by the need to assess the&#13;
technical and financial merits of each case individually.&#13;
4.9       Issues. 5/   The issues facing the program can be grouped under four&#13;
headings: (a) Risks, as reflected in the arrears on loans and the closure&#13;
rates of the enterprises assisted; (b) the costs and risks of the program in&#13;
relation to its economic returns; (c) the dependence of the program, and thus&#13;
of the enterprises financed, on DBP; and (d) the shortage of short-term loans&#13;
for working capital finance.&#13;
1/   The large volume of small loan requests has also created a dependence&#13;
on DBP, as discussed further below.&#13;

enterprises.&#13;
5/   The following is based on analysis of records; interviews with exten-&#13;

institutions; visits to 30 enterprises assisted under the program; and&#13;

4.10      (a)  Arrears and Closure Rates of Enterprises Assisted.    Monitoring&#13;
surveys were undertaken by the Ministry of Industry in 1977 and 1979, the&#13;
first taking a 50% sample of all projects, and the second a 100% sample of&#13;
all manufacturing enterprises having received loans of over P 15,000. 1/&#13;
The questions considered were, are the enterprises still operating? are they&#13;
up-to-date or in arrears in loan repayments? if in arrears, what are the&#13;
causes? and how do actual sales, profits and employment compare with what was&#13;
projected?&#13;
4.11      The statuses of the enterprises assisted, and of the loans made to&#13;
them, are shown in Annex     Table 4.4.  About 25% had closed down by 1979, an&#13;
average closure rate of about 9% per year. 2/ The latter is higher than the&#13;
"natural" closure rates of 3 to 5% per year for small and medium enterprises&#13;
as a whole, estimated in Chapter 6 from NCSO and interview data, 3/ and&#13;
appears to have increased significantly since the 1977 survey. Forty six&#13;
percent of the projects had loans in arrears. Total arrears on principal and&#13;
interest outstanding were 15%, which is lower than the averages reported in&#13;
Chapter 2 for IGLF and DBP, but much higher than the private sector would&#13;
consider as being acceptable.   Higher risks might be expected on MASICAP&#13;
projects since as noted earlier it is the more uncertain cases that are&#13;
referred to the extension workers in the first place. In addition, the&#13;
arrears levels are partly a consequence of the still evolving appraisal and&#13;
supervision procedures of the financial institutions; the financial institu-&#13;
tions are solely responsible for accepting or rejecting a loan request and,&#13;
with hindsight, several of those involved in directing the MASICAP program&#13;
were surprised that the rejection rate of MASICAP projects during appraisal&#13;
was so low (Annex Table 4.1). Nevertheless, it is necessary to inquire&#13;
if MASICAP's own procedures can be improved in various ways to reduce the&#13;
risks; on this, two suggestions can be made.&#13;
4.12      First - a not uncommon phenomenon - there is a tendency for project&#13;
benefits to be overestimated and costs to be underestimated. Examination of&#13;
a sample of 100 projects showed that sales levels in the first year were at&#13;
least 50% below what was forecast in 66% of the cases, and between zero and&#13;
1/   Also included were non-manufacturing enterprises with loans of over&#13;
P 50,000. Unfortunately, self-financed enterprises assisted by the&#13;
extension workers, which could have provided some useful contrasts,&#13;
were excluded from the sample.&#13;
2/   Estimated as follows let nt be the number of enterprises assisted in&#13;
tear t, t years before the monitoring survey, f the closure rate and P&#13;
the proportion having closed down by the time of the survey. Then&#13;
the proportion remaining (1-P), is given by&#13;
Ent (1-f)t/ En t&#13;
Values of n are provided in Annex 1, Table 4.1, and (1-P) is 0.252&#13;
from Annex i, Table 4.4.&#13;
3/   Paras 6.37 et. seq.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
50% below forecasts in another 24%. 1/ Actual employment levels were also&#13;
substantially below forecasts. Since the loans went to finance an expansion&#13;
of fixed assets, the costs of which were also underestimated, most firms&#13;
(including many not subsequently in arrears on loan repayments) immediately&#13;
ran into cash flow problems. While the monitoring surveys commonly attributed&#13;
the arrears problem to a lack of markets, the reality was that the markets,&#13;
and the firm's share in them, had been overestimated. One safeguard against&#13;
the optimism would be to involve the extension workers more in follow-up work&#13;
on the projects, as has recently been proposed in the Ministry. At present&#13;
the projects are left entirely to the banks after appraisal, and the exten-&#13;
sion workers have no systematic knowledge of how they work out in practice.&#13;
The idea is that, apart from being useful to the banks in their own super-&#13;
vision work, an arrangement which involved the extension workers visiting and&#13;
reporting on the projects periodically would also introduce more realistic&#13;
expectations into their forecasts. Having to be accountable for the quality&#13;
(as opposed to quantity, as at present) of projects would also be a good&#13;
discipline. 2/&#13;
4.13      A second way of reducing risks would be to make finance available&#13;
only to existing enterprises, 3/ and to relate the amount lent to the current&#13;
size of the business. This would not preclude offering advisory and training&#13;
services (through the SBAC program) to new or prospective businessmen, but&#13;
the evidence is that to finance them when new, or to increase the size of a&#13;
business substantially in one step, significantly increases the risks. An&#13;
additional point is that the majority of businesses start with very low levels&#13;
of investment in order first to develop the products and establish their mar-&#13;
kets and supplies before expanding into larger entities; very few need large&#13;
amounts of finance when beginning. 4/ Annex Table 4.5 presents data on the&#13;
characteristics of enterprises in arrears and up-to-date in loan repayments.&#13;
Comparing the percentage distributions shown in the Table, the percentage of&#13;
projects in arrears on loan repayments are relatively high among enterprises&#13;
that (a) were new, (b) had received the largest loans (of P SOO,OOO and&#13;
above), or (c) had received large loans relative to the size of the enterprise&#13;
before the loan. All three situations leave the businesses with comparatively&#13;
large overheads and highly vulnerable even to small shortfalls in markets and&#13;
supplies.&#13;
1/   Reported by Mrs. Fajardo (1979).&#13;
2/   The annual and quarterly reports on the program currently give only the&#13;
numbers of projects prepared and in various stages of processing, but no&#13;
records as to their status after finance.&#13;
3/   C.f. the practices of the private financial institutions discussed in&#13;
Chapter 2, which only lend (other than for small personal loans) to&#13;
people having been in the business for some time.&#13;
4/   For a further discussion see Chapter 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
4.14       Another feature of interest in the Table is the lack of any associa-&#13;
tion between the incidence of arrears and the type of ownership, the location&#13;
and type of product market, or the size of the loan (below about P 500,000).&#13;
There is no apparent variation in arrears with respect to the type of ownership&#13;
(single proprietorships or incorporated enterprises), market location (local,&#13;
regional, national or export), or market group (low or high income).&#13;
4.15      One other possibility for reducing risks would be for the program to&#13;
respond more explicitly to the demands for working capital loans, which are&#13;
inherently less risky than loans for fixed assets. As working capital finance&#13;
raises several issues not related to risks, however, it is taken up under&#13;
separate heading below. 1/&#13;
(b) Effects of Extension Costs and Enterprise Closures on the&#13;
Economic Returns to the Program. The costs of training and paying for exten-&#13;
sionists to work individually (often over a long period) with each of a large&#13;
number of small enterprises naturally raises the question, how seriously do&#13;
they affect the chances of having a satisfactory economic return to the pro-&#13;
gram? A similar question can be raised about the high closure rates discussed&#13;
above. The lack of reliable ex post estimates of profits and earnings in the&#13;
enterprises assisted unfortunately prevents specific estimates of economic&#13;
returns being made at the present time; but by considering a range of values,&#13;
some general answers. are possible. The economic benefits of each project can&#13;
be estimated by comparing the present worth of incremental sales with incre-&#13;
mental costs. If these are aggregated up over all projects and an economic&#13;
rate of return is calculated, denoted by.r* then the actual returns to the&#13;
economy are given by: 2/&#13;
r=       r*&#13;
(100 + e)&#13;
where e represents the costs of extension, expressed as a percentage of&#13;
the capital costs of the investments, and X the closure rate (percentage&#13;
of enterprises closed per year).&#13;
4.16       Overall costs in the first five years of the program were P 12.3&#13;
million ($1.8 million), and the number of projects prepared and subsequently&#13;
financed, 1,800. 3/ Average loan size was P190 thousand, 4/ so that assuming&#13;
1/   Paras 4.22 et. seq.&#13;
2/   See Addendum.   The formula does not include the administrative costs&#13;
faced by the financial institutions, since here we are only considering&#13;
the effects of extension costs on the returns. r and r* should therefore&#13;
be compared with the opportunity cost of supplying capital from the banks.&#13;
3/   Allowing for those in the pipeline at the time.&#13;
4/   Based on a sample of 100 projects.    (Only the size of loans requested&#13;
appear in the MASICAP reports.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
20% equity finance the costs of extension worked out at about e = 3.0% of the&#13;
total investments in the projects. If a small number of large projects are&#13;
excluded, 1/ however, involving loans of over P500 thousand and which are&#13;
not representative of the program s work, the figure would more realistically&#13;
be close to 5%. The closure rates for the enterprises financed after the&#13;
assistance from the program averaged about 9% per year, though as discussed&#13;
earlier there are some grounds for thinking that the figure is rising. If,&#13;
then, to take an example, the rate of return on financing the enterprises was&#13;
15%, ignoring extension costs and closures, it would fall to 15.0/1.05 = 14.3%&#13;
including extension costs, and by nearly two thirds to 5.3% allowing for&#13;
closures. Considering a range of values of r* gives the following:&#13;
Rate of Return, not including extension costs&#13;
and before allowing for enterprise closures          5.0   10.0   15.0   20.0&#13;
Rate of Return, including extension costs but&#13;
before allowing for closed enterprises               4.8    9.5   14.3   19.0&#13;
Rate of Return, including extension costs and&#13;
allowing for closed enterprises                     -4.2    0.5    5.5    10.0&#13;
Hence the closure rates are probably having a more adverse effect on the eco-&#13;
nomic returns than the costs of extension, which by comparison are insignifi-&#13;
cant. The extra costs of introducing supervision prodecures, as suggested&#13;
above, and placing during supervision a greater emphasis on the quality (as&#13;
opposed to quantity) of projects would no doubt be justified if, as intended,&#13;
they were to reduce the closure rates.&#13;
4.18      The larger question as to the ex-post benefits of the program cannot&#13;
be answered at the present time without information on the profits and labors&#13;
earnings variables noted in the Annex. Ex-post estimates at present might in&#13;
any case be misleading as to the long-run value of the program, if, as argued&#13;
above, there is scope for improving it further. Ex ante estimates are pos-&#13;
sible but would be undependable until a better forecasting record has been&#13;
achieved. 2/&#13;
4.19      (c)  The Dependence of the Program on DBP.    About 75% of the proj-&#13;
ects generated by the program were financed by DBP, 11% by IGLF, and 14% by&#13;
the owners' own equity, other public banks and (a very small percentage) by&#13;
private banks and investment houses out of private resources.&#13;
4.20      The low involvement of the private sector (other than via IGLF) is&#13;
a consequence of the structural constraints discussed in Chapter 2, which make&#13;
private lending to SSEs unprofitable. There is consequently a high demand for&#13;
DBP and IGLF loans, for which queuing times average four months, and are often&#13;
six months to a year (Annex Table 4.6). The low interest rates of DPP and&#13;
IGLF further encourage queuing, and also a number of enterprises to seek the&#13;
1/   Comprising 8% of the number of projects in the portfolio.&#13;
2/   See also Chapters 8 and 9 on methods of estimating benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
assistances of MASICAP that would not normally do so, but see the program as&#13;
a way of obtaining low cost funds. A survey of the file data and visits to&#13;
enterprises showed that a not small percentage of MASICAP and IGLF clients had&#13;
had very good educations, and had both the income and familiarity with banks&#13;
to undertake or otherwise organize the preparatory work themselves. These&#13;
points highlight a danger facing the MASICAP program. This is that, so long&#13;
as the structural constraints inhibit the private financial sector's involve-&#13;
ment, there is a possibility of the program becoming a permanent part of the&#13;
bureaucracy of administered credit.&#13;
4.21      Within the Government's financing programs the dependence on DBP&#13;
follows from the size distribution of loan requests in MASICAP's projects; 44%&#13;
are for under P 50,000 which is below the floor limit on IGLF, and 74% for&#13;
under P 150,000, which is about the minimum size of loans (though there are&#13;
exceptions) that the private institutions using IGLF find profitable. If then&#13;
the intention is to use IGLF to encourage a wider involvement of the private&#13;
sector in lending to small enterprises, there is a case for making the spreads&#13;
on IGLF greater at the very small loan end, and for removing the floor limit.&#13;
4.22      (d)  Working Capital.   The shortage of working capital finance is&#13;
(like the program's dependence on DBP) not strictly an issue to be taken up&#13;
in connection with the MASICAP program; but since it is the experience gained&#13;
through the extension program that serves to highlight the issue,it is appro-&#13;
priate to raise it in this Chapter.&#13;
4.23      The present financing programs of the Government are almost wholly&#13;
concentrated on term lending. While some of the finance is for "permanent"&#13;
working capital, the main part is for fixed assets. 1/ The share of finance&#13;
for working relative to fixed capital is also often reduced during appraisal, 2/&#13;
in part because the latter can be used to secure the loan. Although we were&#13;
unable to demonstrate the point quantitatively, interviews with several pro-&#13;
prietors suggested that perhaps over one third of the projects would have been&#13;
better suited for working capital finance, or required a better blend of work-&#13;
ing and fixed capital finance. In some cases., the projects were applications&#13;
'in disguise' for working capital,, in which the fixed assets (on buildings,&#13;
especially) had been dressed-up in various ways; this had often placed a&#13;
financial stress on the business, by adding to overheads without adding cor-&#13;
respondingly to output. In other cases the owners said explicitly that what&#13;
had been needed in the first place was working capital. 3/&#13;
4.24      The available data on small manufacturing enterprises shows high&#13;
proportions of working capital in the asset structure. In the industrialized&#13;
countries, it has historically been the principal element. Kennett (1979)&#13;
remarks that "the technological transition of the Industrial Revolution was&#13;
largely financed in the form of working capital. In the middle eighteenth&#13;
1/   See Annex Table 4.2, footnote 1.&#13;
2/   See Annex Table 4.2.&#13;
3/   This point is also apparent from the monitoring surveys of the MASICAP&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
century the ratio of inventory to fixed capital in metal working and textiles&#13;
in England was around 8:1 .... The technology change saw an increase in fixed&#13;
capital, but well into the nineteenth century the value of inventories was 3&#13;
or 4 times the replacement value of fixed capital." For US manufacturing in&#13;
1974 his estimates of the ratios of working to fixed capital were 2.03, 1.70&#13;
and 1.33 respectively for small, medium and large firms. Precisely comparable&#13;
data are not- available for Philippine mannfacturing. Working capital assets&#13;
include accounts receivable, cash and short-term securities, and inventories.&#13;

The data are not dissimilar to those footnoted below for India. The share of&#13;
inventories in total assets varies greatly with industry, ranging from about&#13;
26% for food processing, 32% in textiles, 41% in wearing apparel, and 62% in&#13;
the manufacture of machinery and equipment (these figures are all for small&#13;
scale). 2/&#13;

4.25      It may help to make issues in working capital finance more concrete&#13;
if an example is taken. If a business expands its fixed assets by P 100&#13;
thousand using a DBP or IGLF term-loan, it is likely to require at certain&#13;
times of the year an expansion of assets in working capital ranging from about&#13;
P 70 thousand to P 200 thousand or above depending on the sector - say P 150&#13;
thousand on average, corresponding to 60% of assets being in the form of work-&#13;
ing capital. Of this, about P 30 thousand or 20%, will be a minimum below&#13;
which stocks and accounts receivable will not fall, unless the business is in&#13;
dire straights; this is the 'permanent' working capital of the business, and&#13;
by coincidence it is roughly the amount that DBP and IGLF finance on average.&#13;
The remaining P 120 thousand - which is still greater than the original&#13;
investment in fixed assets - must come out of retained earnings, trade credits&#13;
or further loans. But in most cases, further loans are forestalled by the&#13;
collateral already tied up in the loans on fixed assets, unless the appraiser&#13;
and the owner were prescient enough to anticipate the need to leave some&#13;
collateral 'in reserve' for working capital loans. Trade credits in the form&#13;
of advanced purchases may be common for some firms, such as those to whom work&#13;
is 'put out' or subcontracted; but however important this source may be, it is&#13;
not universally available or useful to all firms. Trade credits on materials&#13;
supplies are often available too, and are common in the garments industries&#13;
(where putting-out is also common). But what about firms with relatively long&#13;
production periods, in which labor costs and overheads are high while material&#13;
costs and stocks are low? Similarly, what of the firms in the agricultural&#13;
provinces - e.g. those maintaining or supplying agricultural equipment, or&#13;
others catering for fairly steady demands where the-consumers incomes fluc-&#13;
tuate seasonally - which may need to offer credit to, rather than receive&#13;
credit from, their customers? In these cases, trade credits are either not&#13;
available, or supplied rather than received, and, in the absence of short-term&#13;
finance from banks, the business must turn to the curb market or retained&#13;
earnings. If these sources are also scarce, the result is a substantial&#13;
financial stress on the business.&#13;
4.26      To sum up, both the needs for and the sources of supply of working&#13;
capital finance vary greatly between businesses, and in practice many busi-&#13;
nesses 'blend' different sources of finance. Further, some may need far more&#13;
short-term than long-term finance.&#13;
4.27      There is then a case for the programs to respond more explicitly&#13;
to the demand. First, there are several disadvantages of supplying working&#13;
capital finance "permanently" since the timing and the magnitudes of a busi-&#13;
nesses' demands for working capital are highly uncertain, and vary with the&#13;
flow and size of job-orders and the availability of supplies. Second, it&#13;
would eliminate the financial stresses just mentioned that are unnecessarily&#13;
placed on some businesses, and which are reported by the extension workers to&#13;
have caused several closures. Third, it would reduce the risks on the program.&#13;
Working capital finance is intrinsically less risky since the amounts requested&#13;
can be related to current sales and assets or to contract orders, instead of&#13;
to forecast values. There may also be some merit in financing more of the&#13;
former and letting a greater share of investment finance come out of retained&#13;
earnings. It would, for instance, constrain an enterprise to grow more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
more naturally in relation to the growth of its markets, and avoid the dangers&#13;
of expanding (as happened in several of the cases discussed above) in large&#13;
steps to meet anticipated but as yet unrealized markets; one can be too con-&#13;
servative in these respects, but as seen above it is also too easy to be&#13;
excessively optimistic. Fourth, the demand could be met more speedily, and&#13;
the policy would reduce the congestion now faced by DBP, and the long pro-&#13;
cessing times (which are not admissible for working capital finance) faced&#13;
by the borrowers. There is also no reason why it should not - and perhaps&#13;
more so than with long-term loans - act to familiarize institutions in lending&#13;
to small enterprises and reduce their perceptions of the risks involved; it&#13;
would be consistent therefore with the basic ideas of the Government's finan-&#13;
cing programs. Lastly, it would probably be a better way of involving the&#13;
commercial banks in the program. 1/ Although there are exceptions (as dis-&#13;
cussed in Chapter 2) IGLF has met with resistance in part because term-lend-&#13;
ing is not a specialization of commercial banks, and has proved to be more&#13;
acceptable to those non-bank financial intemediaries more specialized in&#13;
term finance.&#13;
4.28      As to supply, the ideal policy would be to release the constraints&#13;
on effective spreads, discussed in Chapter 2, and support the changes as&#13;
necessary with risk-guarantee or risk-sharing schemes (analogously with IGLF).&#13;
Alternatives are possible, however, and the purpose of the present discussion&#13;
is merely to raise the issue. There also seems to be no good reason why the&#13;
supply points of working capital to industry should be concentrated on the&#13;
financial sector alone; trade credits from commercial enterprises in many&#13;
respects make much more efficient and lower risk suppliers - if only because&#13;
they also offer the market outlets, materials supplies and a range of product&#13;
design, advisory and training services as well. This was particularly apparent&#13;
in a series of interviews held with enterprises in the garments and handicrafts&#13;
sectors. In several cases the enterprises were ostensibly in manufacturing,&#13;
but most of the work was in fact put-out to households; the owners themselves&#13;
were mainly involved in designing the products, marketing, obtaining raw mate-&#13;
rials supplies and training the household workers. 2/ Hence the Government's&#13;
1/   Joe Pernia pointed out that, if the extension programs were involved&#13;
in providing assistance with working capital finance, it would require&#13;
a revision of procedures.&#13;
2/   Two of the small eneerprises of this type that we interviewed (one in&#13;
garments and blankets, the other in macrame) were marketing the output of&#13;
over 200 households (the figure was easily checked from figures on the&#13;
sales volumes and the times taken to produce the articles). One had&#13;
since established a central weaving and garment making factory, but&#13;
continued putting-out work to households; in the other, only a dozen&#13;
employees worked in the main establishment, some to provide training,&#13;
the others handling materials and storage. The households work in&#13;
groups, each with a group leader, to whom a commission is paid, responsi-&#13;
ble for passing out the materials, supervision and controlling quality.&#13;
"Putting-out" appears to be quite widespread in the Philippines, as it&#13;
was historically in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
policies - and in particular their financing aspects - could be more effective&#13;
if they did not concentrate specifically on small industrial enterprises, but&#13;
responded to the demands of small enterprises more generally.&#13;
4.29      One objection to supplying working capital might be that it is less&#13;
likely to be associated with an increase in the demand for labor. There is,&#13;
however, no evidence for this, as the examples provided in the preceding&#13;
paragraph illustrate. The demand for labor is determined more by the growth&#13;
of markets than perhaps any other factor. By improving access to supplies and&#13;
the capacity of business to meet larger orders, working capital finance should&#13;
have a measurable influence on employment and earnings opportunities. 1/&#13;
Advisory Services (The SBAC Program)&#13;
4.30      So far the discussion has only considered the preparation of projects&#13;
for finance. But the larger element in the Government's extension programs,&#13;
at least in terms of professional staffing, is to provide advisory services to&#13;
small industries. From the beginning of the Government's SMI program these&#13;
have always been considered desirable since it was felt that the demands of&#13;
small enterprises would not necessarily be solely for finance. This is par-&#13;
ticularly true for enterprises just starting up (as the enterprise interviews&#13;
reported in Chapter 6 will show), when most begin with very small&#13;
investments. Since 1974, Small Business Advisory Centers have been set up&#13;
in each of the 12 administrative regions of the country; they now employ over&#13;
100 regular professional staff variously specialized in engineering, finance&#13;
and business management. Before examining questions (a) about the demand for&#13;
such services, and (b) what the Government's role is in providing them, it is&#13;
necessary to discuss what they are intended to do. Some points will also be&#13;
footnoted from another a report on the same subject; 2/ although produced in a&#13;
very different context it provides evidence and conclusions remarkably similar&#13;
to those following from the Philippines' experience.&#13;
4.31      Services Offered.   The services are provided free of charge, 3/&#13;
and cover most aspects and stages of small business activity.    Most of&#13;
the clients are "walk-ins" or referred to the SBACs by others (Annex Table&#13;
4.7). About 30% of the SBAC's work is in what is called entrepreneurial&#13;
1/   See Chapter 9 for a discussion of methods for assessing the benefits&#13;
and costs of alternative policy and project measures.&#13;

counselling 1/ for new or prospective business people, and another 40% for&#13;
established businesses with "no serious problems" but who visit the SBACs&#13;
to talk to the staff about the running or expansion of their businesses. 2/&#13;
While advice on specific technical, marketing or financial issues is often&#13;
1/   The advice offered here is about marketing opportunities, whether the&#13;
industry is over-crowded, sources of equipment, sources of finance,&#13;
suggestions on cash flow management, various pitfalls (of which starting&#13;
too large before markets are established is common). Seminars for&#13;
small business proprietors are sometimes held in the centers.&#13;
2/   One of the distinguishing charactersitics of very small businesses&#13;
is that the owners control all aspects of the business, are often able&#13;
to keep records in their heads, and have not felt need for accountants&#13;
or managerial support. The SBAC staff find that the most noticeable&#13;
tendency of small businesses when expanding is for the owners to cling&#13;
to the control of all aspects of the business, even when it becomes&#13;
too large for one person to manage. Workshops also become congested&#13;
and expand haphazardly. Discussions on when to employ people with,&#13;
say, management or accounting skills, showing what other businesses have&#13;
done, are apparently helpful to the owners in making their own decisions.&#13;
It is interesting to compare this experience with what the Bolton Report&#13;
mentioned above had to say about small industries in quite a different&#13;
setting (op. cit. p.112):-&#13;
"The majority of small firm proprietors ha.ve no professional&#13;
or other formal qualifications and only a tiny minority have specific&#13;
qualifications in management. They run their business on the basis&#13;
of their experience and commonsense. This may be very effective so&#13;
long as the scale of the firm's activities remains small enough for one&#13;
man to control them all effectively, and so long as no serious crisis&#13;
overwhelms his pragmatic management. Either of these eventualities,&#13;
however - significant growth or a need to consider drastic changes in&#13;
the firm's policy - is likely to reveal a need for certain specialist&#13;
skills which are most unlikely to be found within the average small&#13;
firm."&#13;
"Every large company as a matter of course employs specialists&#13;
in the functional fields of management. These include, for example,&#13;
financial management and accounting, purchasing, production planning&#13;
and control, marketing and personnel management. The small firm is&#13;
prevented by the scale of its operatinns from employing a specialist in&#13;
every function, and in any case, the imposition of a management structure&#13;
more suited to a large organization would lead only to confusion and/or&#13;
unnecessary expense. So far as they are needed therefore, and so far&#13;
as the need is recognized, sophisticated management skills and specialist&#13;
knowledge must usually be brought in from outside. It is very often the&#13;
case that the need is not recognized: The implication of this is that&#13;
there is a very large potential market among small firms for advisory&#13;
and management services of all kinds."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
sought, the SBAC staff say it is as often difficult to pinpoint precisely what&#13;
it is that the owner may wish to discuss, or, in the case of a business with&#13;
"serious problems," what the causes of the problems are. 1/ Reports are pre-&#13;
pared if requested, and the SBAC staff member may work with a business over&#13;
a long period; when a matter lies outside the specialization of the staff,&#13;
referrals to the specialized trading, industrial and research associations&#13;
are common.&#13;
4.32      Follow-up and Evaluation of SBAC Projects.    There are presently&#13;
no procedures which require the SBAC staff to follow-up and report on the&#13;
progress of the enterprises after they have sought advice. Current records&#13;
provide descriptions on the backgrounds of the clients and often quite de-&#13;
tailed analyses of the technical, financial and managerial aspects of the&#13;
business. Since the staff often spend a considerable time with the business&#13;
1/   There is again a close parallel here with what the Bolton Report found&#13;
about small firm consultancy services in the U.K. (op.cot. pp. 122-123):-&#13;
"There are two serious difficulties in providing consultancy&#13;
for small firms: first, the consulting operation is not, as might be&#13;
thought, necessarily more simple than advising a large firm, but in&#13;
some ways more difficult; and second, the strong sales-resistance of&#13;
the typical small businessman necessitates a,powerful marketing effort&#13;
which the majority of consultants, given a high level of demand for&#13;
their services, are not prepared to make. It is consequently very&#13;
difficult to run such services profitably."&#13;
"Because the small firm will rarely have identified correctly the&#13;
problem giving rise to the need for advice, the consultant will need&#13;
very wide experience, since his first task will often be to survey the&#13;
whole of the firm's operations and identify the basic trouble. This&#13;
point was well made by a representative of the Management Consultants&#13;
Association, who said: 'If ICI ask you to come in and do some time&#13;
study on the loading bay you can be pretty sure that is what they&#13;
want, whereas if a small business asks you to do that you have not&#13;
a clue whether that is really the problem.' The small businessman&#13;
who calls in a consultant is normally aware only that something is&#13;
going wrong and he expects the consultant to diagnose the trouble&#13;
and suggest a solution. Very often, he is unwilling to discuss his&#13;
problem with his staff and has nobody else with whom to share the deci-&#13;
sion making. In these circumstances, if the consultant can gain the&#13;
businessman's confidence he may perform a very valuable service in pro-&#13;
viding a sympathetic ear, putting the problems in perspective (which&#13;
involves pointing out that they are not unique, but have probably been&#13;
faced and solved in most successful businesses), and generally acting&#13;
as a trusted counsellor."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
(from a few hours to several weeks in some cases) a detailed picture of the&#13;
business and whatever problems are faced is obtained; in the process, .the&#13;
staff workers generate more than a little trust and goodwill. Contact is&#13;
commonly maintained with the business afterwards, but only informally. As&#13;
with the MASICAP program, there are good grounds for formalizing the follow-up&#13;
work and keeping records on current sales, employment, investments and expendi-&#13;
tures in the enterprises assisted, and reporting on any current issues. Apart&#13;
from providing feedback on the program, the information so generated could be&#13;
useful for reporting on the conditions of small businesses in the provinces&#13;
(though in both instances it would need to be supplemented by studies of&#13;
businesses not assisted by the program). While, for instance, the NCS0,&#13;
the Central Bank and several private sector institutions publish reasonably&#13;
up-to-date surveys and studies of large industries, there is no up-to-date&#13;
information on small businesses; this alone is a major source of risks.&#13;
4.33      The absence of information on the subsequent developments of busi-&#13;
ness after the SBAC staff have worked with a firm also makes it difficult&#13;
to assess the usefulness of the services. The costs of the program over&#13;
the first four years 1/ were about P 8m ($1.1m), and averaged about P 2,500&#13;
($340) per client; 2/ but there is no information at present that would&#13;
enable the benefits to be determined. From an economic viewpoint, the purpose&#13;
of the services is to increase the economic returns (that is, r* and r in the&#13;
formula above) by encouraging the adoption of better business practices and&#13;
production methods, and assisting in the search for markets. If, then,&#13;
material were collected on the economic returns to capital for a sample of&#13;
SBAC-assisted enterprises, and compared with enterprises not assisted, it&#13;
should be possible to estimate the economic returns to the program using&#13;
variance analysis. 3/&#13;
1/   The program started in 1975, one year after MASICAP.&#13;
2/   The average is P8,000 if only clients for whom written reports were&#13;
prepared are counted. It would, however, be wrong to ignore those&#13;
assisted less formally.&#13;
3/   It would evidently be necessary to allow for differing endowments&#13;
of the owners. If r is the return to capital of enterprise j, then&#13;
one might correlate 2 with variables from the following groups (each in&#13;
themselves being charaicterized by several variables): - educational&#13;
background of owner; initial wealth or income; access to infrastructure&#13;
(roads and electricity in particular); location; management practices&#13;
adopted; types and vintages of production methods and equipment; and&#13;
whether SBAC advised or not.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
4.34      The Government's Role in Providing Small Business Advisory Services:&#13;
A Comment. The SBAC staff classify their services under the following head-&#13;
ings: financial (advice only), accounting and record-keeping, management,&#13;
marketing, technical and general services (covering more than one aspect of&#13;
the business). It is not difficult to think of instances where these services&#13;
may be found or developed in the private sector, so some comments on how the&#13;
Government's services relate to those in the private sector are appropriate.&#13;
4.35      Accounting firms, banks and consulting firms are common sources&#13;
of financial and management advice in many countries, and employ people&#13;
who can back their advice with substantive experience of their industry&#13;
or profession and (as important) a knowledge of local business. 1/ In the&#13;
Philippines the services offered by banks (which as seen in Chapter 2 pres-&#13;
ently are accessible to only a small percentage of the small business com-&#13;
munity) can be expected to grow with the growth of savings deposits and of&#13;
loans made under the SMI program; in this, as with the SBAC's advisory ser-&#13;
vices on accounting and management, the Government programs serves to create&#13;
an awareness of the value of proven business management practices, and should&#13;
if anything stimulate the demand for private sector services. The only poten-&#13;
tial conflict arises from the SBAC's services being free of charge in certain&#13;
categories of services in which the program is competing with the private&#13;
sector (e.g. in accounting). Since the program has an educational purpose that&#13;
goes beyond the strict idea of supplying services, full cost recovery would&#13;
probably not be merited from an economic viewpoint at the present time; there&#13;
are in addition fixed costs to the economy in promoting the services, which&#13;
1/   In the industrialized countries they are probably more sought after&#13;
than the Government's services. In the Bolton Report (op.cit. p.116)&#13;
for the U.K., the results of a survey were quoted in which the question&#13;
was asked: "If you need help, to which of the following would you be&#13;
most likely to turn?" Replies were received from 3,740 firms as follows:&#13;
Accountant             1, 383&#13;
Solicitor                561&#13;
Bank Manager             543&#13;
Chamber of Commerce      496&#13;
Trade Association        485&#13;
Business Consultant      143&#13;
CBI                      129&#13;
The report added that "the outstanding feature of this Table is that the&#13;
sources most likely to be called upon are localized and familiar; accoun-&#13;
tants, solicitors and bank managers will usually be personally known to&#13;
the businessman seeking help. The same is true of chamber of commerce&#13;
officials (another localized service) and to a lesser extent of trade&#13;
associations.&#13;

set average costs above marginal costs. 1/ But charges for certain categories&#13;
of services, or for selected costs   might be considered - e.g. for repeater&#13;
clients, and for the expenditures on staff and materials when written reports&#13;
are requested.&#13;
4.36      Marketing and technical services (including research) by their&#13;
nature require a highly specialized knowledge of the industrial sectors in&#13;
which they are demanded; and, in the provision of them, it seems important&#13;
not to overlook the role of the industrial and trading associations. In most&#13;
countries such associations were formed for purposes quite different to those&#13;
which they eventually came to serve, many of which were (and still are) iden-&#13;
tified with the avoidance of competition. But the range of services now&#13;
offered are also important for the growth of industry - the provision of mar-&#13;
ket intelligence, legal advice and technical publications; supporting trade&#13;
missions, exhibitions and industrial research; and in some cases providing&#13;
training and advisory services for their members. 2/ In the Philippines they&#13;
cover quite a large number of industries, but for the most part are fragmented&#13;
and confine their activities to industries in Manila. Most appear to have&#13;
been formed as a consequence of the exchange controls in the 1950s, but are&#13;
now beginning to offer a forum for promoting their industries and opening up&#13;
marketing opportunities; 3/ a number have also introduced training programs.&#13;
These developments are being further encouraged through a series of dialogues&#13;
between the Ministry and the Associations.&#13;
4.37      What the above suggests, from the viewpoint of developing the&#13;
SBAC program, is that many of the specialized services needed by both small&#13;
and large industries are capable of being developed by firms and institutions&#13;
in the private sector. The temptation to develop a plethora of specialized&#13;
and costly services within the program might better be resisted, therefore,&#13;
in favor of the current emphases of the program. These are (i) to increase&#13;
awareness among the small husiness community of the advantages (once the&#13;

consultancy services.&#13;
2/   A report known as the Devlin (1972) Report on Industrial and Commercial&#13;
Representation in the U.K. provides a review of the origins and current&#13;
work of the industrial and trade associations in Europe. Many of its&#13;
comments and views are not irrelevant to a discussion of the future&#13;
role of such institutions in developing countries.&#13;
3/   A recent survey of subcontractors for vehicle parts manufacture found&#13;
that 72% were members of one association or another, including the&#13;
following: Philippine Chamber of Industries, Consolidated Automotive&#13;
Parts Association, Philippine Foundry Society, Machine Shop and Builders&#13;
Association, Confederation of Philippine Exporters, Manufacturing Elec-&#13;
tronics Component Association, Anodizing Association of the Philippines,&#13;
Purchasing Association of the Philippines, and several regional chambers&#13;
and other industry and suppliers groups. One can gather from this that&#13;
a varied and complex institutional structure is emerging in the engi-&#13;
neering sector (as it apparently is in others). When asked about their&#13;
reasons for joining half said that it was to achieve an exchange of mar-&#13;
ket information and technical know-how.&#13;

management and finance; (ii) to improve the quality and timeliness of informa-&#13;

and institutions capable of providing specialized advice. (This suggestion&#13;
is of course only intended for the extension programs, not for the industrial&#13;
development programs of the Ministry as a whole, and which may well require&#13;
specialized inputs. What is not clear at present is that it is necessary to&#13;
develop specialized capacity within the extension services for each and every&#13;
industry that merits promotion'.)&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
4.38      The project preparation services (of MASICAP) have helped to make&#13;
institutional finance available to a large number of enterprises in the&#13;
provinces that would not otherwise have had access to it. Administrative&#13;
costs were also low, about 3-5% of project investments. The main issues&#13;
identified in the course of the present study were the following:&#13;
(1) Arrears rates and closures of the enterprises assisted. Both&#13;
are high and seriously affecting the economic returns to the program. Both&#13;
could be reduced by preparing projects only for businesses already in exis-&#13;
tence and by relating expansion to the current size of business (expansion&#13;
in too large a step increases risks all round). As will be seen in the next&#13;
two chapters, the rate of formation of new business establishments in the&#13;
Philippines is already high, and there is little need for the program to&#13;
attempt to create new ones.   But the main causes of arrearages and closures&#13;
are unrealistic expectations for the projects, leaving many enterprises with&#13;
little or no cushion against shortfalls in markets and profits. Involving&#13;
the extension workers in follow-up work and supervision of the projects after&#13;
finance would help in making expectations more realistic. Ex post account-&#13;
ability for the quality of the projects would also help.&#13;
(2) Economic Returns. The conclusion about the desirability of&#13;
supervison and follow-up work was also supported by an analysis of the effects&#13;
of extension costs and closure rates (risks) on economic returns; the returns&#13;
are much more sensitive to the latter than to the former. (Since the economic&#13;
returns cannot yet be estimated, given limitations in the data, a range of&#13;
possible values was considered; a method for estimating the returns was also&#13;
proposed.)&#13;
(3) The dependence of the program on DBP. The lack of the private&#13;
sector's involvement, for reasons discussed in Chapter 2, has made the program&#13;
dependent on DBP and (to a much lesser extent) IGLF. This has placed a dis-&#13;
proportionate share of the risks and the administrative burden on DBP, in&#13;
contrast with the original aims of the program. Seventy-five percent of the&#13;
projects are either below the P 50,000 floor limit of IGLF or below the point&#13;
(about P150,000, though there are exceptions) at which IGLF lending becomes&#13;
profitable to the private sector. Adjustment of spreads at the smaller loan&#13;
end and a removal of the floor limit would help to involve more financial&#13;
institutions in the Program. A restructuring of financial incentives to&#13;
secure a wider involvement of the private sector out of its own resources&#13;
would still require attention however.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
(4) Working Capital. Several advantages of increasing short-term&#13;
lending - both out of private sector resources and through the Government's&#13;
own programs - were outlined in the text. The main ones would be to lower&#13;
risks and obtain a greater response from the commercial banks; both would be&#13;
consistent with the aims and ideas behind the Government's programs. Trading&#13;
enterprises would be particularly effective conduits for the flow of short-&#13;
term resources to industry, and could be expected to open up markets and fur-&#13;
ther lower the risks; this is one reason why the program might be reoriented&#13;
to respond to the demands of small enterprises in general rather than just&#13;
industrial enterprises in particular.&#13;
4.39      The advisory services (SBAC) program has similarly reached out to a&#13;
large number of enterprises in the provinces, also at a low cost per project.&#13;
The issues identified were:&#13;
(1) Follow-up work. Not much is known about the subsequent devel-&#13;
opments of the enterprises after the services are provided. A systematic&#13;
follow-up and reporting procedure would be valuable both as an information&#13;
service and as feedback.&#13;
(2)  The Government's role in providing advisory services.   Many&#13;
of the services are either available or gradually developing in the private&#13;
sector - in the banks themselves, in accounting and consulting firms, and&#13;
in the specialized trading, industrial and research associations. In many&#13;
respects the SBAC program should stimulate the demand for rather than dis-&#13;
place private sector activities; this is most obvious in the SBAC's work as&#13;
a referral service, but other examples were cited. Since SBAC's services&#13;
are provided free of charge, there is a tendency (particularly with respect&#13;
to accounting and general consultancy) to undercut initiatives in the private&#13;
sector; hence charges for certain types of services and costs are worth con-&#13;
templating. The future development of specialized services ought not to be&#13;
planned or proceed independently of the development of the specialized asso-&#13;
ciations in the private sector.&#13;

Addendum to Chapter IV&#13;
Effects of the Costs of Industrial Extension&#13;
and of Enterprise Failure Rates on the&#13;
Economic Returns to Small Enterprise Projects&#13;
If there are N small enterprise projects financed each year,&#13;
each increasing annual sales on average by S, and running costs (materials,&#13;
labor and other variable costs) on average by R, the present worth of the&#13;
net benefits obtained in any subsequent year t is:&#13;
N(S-R)/(l+r)(1                         &#13;
where r is the opportunity cost of supplying capital (including the&#13;
costs of raising and lending funds). This assumes of course no closures.&#13;
If a fraction X fail each year, the number of projects available to generate&#13;
these benefits in year t would be:&#13;
N/(1+X)t                       (2)&#13;
assuming no reopenings   under new management.    In practice reopenings&#13;
could offset most of the losses to the economy if the capital was used&#13;
at full capacity. If u is the average reopening rate (adjusted for time&#13;
lags between closure and reopening), then the net closure rate is X' - (X-u),&#13;
and is the quantity to be used instead of X in (2). At present there is no&#13;
information on u; but it is likely to be quite small given the nature of the&#13;
closures experienced so far, since most have been due to markets being less&#13;
than forecast and to a shortage of working capital; even before closure,&#13;
output was well short of full capacity output, 1/ Hence one might not be far&#13;
wrong - and may even underestimate the effects of closures - by using A&#13;
instead of (X-u) in the denominator of (2). Hence adjusting (1) for closures,&#13;
the net benefits in year t are roughly:&#13;
N(S-R)/(l+r+X)t                (3)&#13;
Summing over the average lifetime, T of the projects gives:&#13;
-T&#13;
N(S-R)   [1-(r+A)  II(r+X)     (4)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
If the average capital costs of the project are denoted by K 1/ and&#13;
the extension costs, expressed as a proportion of K, by e, then (4) needs to&#13;
be compared with total project costs for the N projects of&#13;
N(l+e)K                                   (5)&#13;
Equating (4) and (5) and using a linear approximation 2/ for the&#13;
numerator of (4) gives the following formula for the rate of return:&#13;
r = (S - R)/(1 + e)K - 1/T - X               (6)&#13;
where the first term represents the economic returns before depreciation,&#13;
the second depreciation, and the third losses due to enterprise closures.&#13;
Considering the case where extension costs are ignored and where there&#13;
are no enterprise failures, the rate of return, denoted by r* in this case,&#13;
is&#13;
r* = (S-R)/K-l/T&#13;
and substituting for (S-R)K in (6) shows the effects of extension costs and of&#13;
enterprise closures to be given by&#13;
r = r*/(l+e)-X-e/(l+e)T&#13;
r*/(l+e)-X&#13;
since e is likely to be small relative-to (1+e)T, and the last term small&#13;
relative to the first two.&#13;

with the project.&#13;

5. UNCERTAINTIES IN CAPITAL MARKETS: A THEORY OF INTERVENTION&#13;
5.1       This chapter reassess the first of the four assumptions raised in&#13;
the introduction to this report. It addresses the questions, taking an&#13;
economic point of view, why intervene in the capital markets in the manner&#13;
described in Part I? if so, what is an optimum way of intervening? and what&#13;
is an optimum interest rate policy in the presence of uncertainty?&#13;
5.2       On interest rates the now standard argument is that administrative&#13;
ceilings (in the Philippines as in most other countries) prevent the rates&#13;
from rising to risk and cost-reflecting levels; lending is thus unprofitable&#13;
and does not take place. While it is difficult to disagree with this, analy-&#13;
sis of uncertainties in capital markets ahows that removal of the ceilings&#13;
is not a sufficient condition for lending to take place, even to large num-&#13;
bers of would-be borrowers with efficient and financially sound projects,&#13;
and with every intention of repaying the loans. The initial magnitude of&#13;
the risks in developing lending programs to small enterprises are extra-&#13;
ordinarily high, while the long-run returns may be in dispute. High cost&#13;
and risk reflecting rates, assuming they were politically acceptable, raise&#13;
project risks yet further and may extinguish any institutional interest in&#13;
the market or prevent it from becoming established. Further, the risks are&#13;
high because potentially "good" borrowers are indistinguishable from "bad"&#13;
borrowers. Since both must be charged the same rate, the former are fre-&#13;
quently driven out of the market by the latter, or must substantially reduce&#13;
their investment, with a loss of economic efficiency. 1/&#13;
5.3       These arguments are familiar from the literature on uncertianty in&#13;
capital markets, most notably in the market for "lemons" paper by Akerlof&#13;
(1970), the readings edited by Diamond and Rothschild (1978) and the recent&#13;
work of Stiglitz and Weiss (1979 and 1980) and others that will be cited. 2/&#13;
Most of these papers are concerned with the behaviour of capital markets under&#13;
uncertainty rather than with reaching normative conclusions on interest rates,&#13;
government financing and risk-guarantee schemes, which is the purpose of the&#13;
discussion below. The evidence in Chapters 2 and 3 showed that both risks and&#13;
administrative costs decline over time at a rate depending on an institution's&#13;
response to risk and also on the accumulation of information and experience&#13;
1/   Or as Rotschild and Stiglitz (1976) note: "high risk individuals&#13;
cause an externality: the low-risk individuals are worse off than&#13;
they would be in the absence of high risk individuals" (p. 629).&#13;
2/   We are grateful to Noburu Kawai for bringing this literature to our&#13;
attention in his "Comment on the SSE Research Project," October 22, 1979.&#13;
(mimeo). There are also some striking parallels between the analysis&#13;
below and the analysis of risk in agricultural credit policies; see&#13;
e.g. the paper by Lipton (1979), which I. J. Singh drew to our attention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
within the institution. That is, there is "learning by doing" of the kind&#13;
discussed by Arrow (1965),and economies of scale, each requiring a forward&#13;
looking view of interest rate policies. Optimal interest rates are derived&#13;
below first from a financial and then from an economic perspective, taking&#13;
into account the various constraints faced by the institutions; both converge&#13;
to the same result, with the "best" policy suggesting interest rate levels&#13;
sufficient to make lending profitable over the long-haul, but supporting the&#13;
idea of risk-sharing and direct financing to absorb the more-immediate losses.&#13;
(This is also the conclusion reached in Chapters 2 and 3.) Given the importance&#13;
of learning and economies of scale, it is not surprising that the expected&#13;
volume of business is a crucial factor in determining long-run profitability,&#13;
and thus the economic desireability of the programs.&#13;
Uncertainties in the Capital Markets&#13;
5.4       Although risks and administrative costs change over time, it is&#13;
their initial magnitude - and of risks in particular - that inhibits lending&#13;
as much as any other factor. This is partly because ceilings on interest&#13;
rates contribute towards institutions planning for the short-run; but given&#13;
the even greater uncertainties about the demand for loans in the long-run (at&#13;
least with respect to the demand from small enterprises) it is possible that&#13;
short-run considerations would still predominate, and it is useful to consider&#13;
this case first before examining the forward-looking case.&#13;
5.5       Initial Magnitude of the Risks.   To begin with a simple aggregative&#13;
statement, let p be the probability of the principal and interest due on the&#13;
loans not being repaid, and (l+r) the actual principal plus interest outstand-&#13;
ing per unit of principal. The fraction of principal and interest likely to&#13;
be recovered is (l-p)(l+r). Similarly let (l+i) be the principal and interest&#13;
on raising resources, and 'a' the administrative costs of handling the loans,&#13;
each again being expressed per unit of principal. Then for lending to be&#13;
profitable it is necessary that; 1/&#13;
(l-p)(l+r) &gt; (l+i) + a&#13;
or              r &gt; (i+a+p)/(l-p)                            (1)&#13;
Note that p appears in both the numerator and the denominator on the RHS of&#13;
(1) since the interest payments from the "good" accounts must cover the lost&#13;
principal in addition to the lost interest from the "bad" accounts.    "Good"&#13;
accounts are thus penalized twice. Putting some numbers into this expression,&#13;
1/   Expressed on an annual basis, the above criterion is the same as&#13;
A(r) &gt; A(i+a)/(l-p), where A(r) and A(i+a) denotes the annuity rate,&#13;
and can be estimated from standard financial tables. (Here of course,&#13;
r and (i+a) are interest rates.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
i was about 16% for short term resources in December 1979 (see Chapter 3) and&#13;
of course would be higher for long-term resources; -a' would be about 4% but&#13;
could be more or less depending on the size and maturity of the loan and the&#13;
familiarity of the bank with the borrower. Hence the annuitised cost would be&#13;
in excess of A(20%) = 33% for borrowings of 5 year maturity. If one takes the&#13;
percentage of principal and interest outstanding that is in arrears by more&#13;
than 6 months 1/ to be a measure of p, then the initial value of p would be in&#13;
the range 0.3 to 0.5 or higher. 2/ Hence for term-lending 3/ to be profitable&#13;
in the early years, risk-reflecting annuity rates would have to be in the&#13;
range 33/(0.3 to 0.5) = 66 to 100%, implying interest rates of 60 to 97% or&#13;
higher 4/ - roughly three to five times the levels required for loans to large&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
5.7       In practice, interest rates in the Philippines (as in most other&#13;
countries) are prevented from rising to such levels by administrative ceilings.&#13;
Even without the ceilings, however, it is unlikely that the banks and non-bank&#13;
financial intermediaries would be prepared to charge very high rates for small&#13;
borrowers alone. Apart from fears of political attack, there are grounds for&#13;
believing that their willingness-to-lend would decline as interest rates rose&#13;
to high levels, and that the supply curve may be backward sloping. 5/ First,&#13;
the margins for contingency on the borrowers' projects as planned would be&#13;
greatly reduced, raising doubts in the institutions about the capacity of&#13;
small borrowers to service debts. Second, related to this, is the argument of&#13;
Stiglitz and Weiss (1979) that higher interest rates may attract the riskier&#13;
and deter the more conservative borrowers, and induce others to undertake&#13;
yet riskier projects in the expectation of higher returns. That is, while&#13;
revenues per loan repaid rise with interest rates, the probability of repayment&#13;
decreases, and Stiglitz and Weiss argue that there is an optimum interest rate&#13;
which under plausible conditions can be below the market clearing rate. Hence&#13;
we are still left with credit rationing and a system in which potentially&#13;
"good" borrowers are driven out of the market by the "lemons". Finally, the&#13;
banks and non-bank financial intermediaries have to maintain a reputation for&#13;
financial soundness, and would not wish to report high risk elements in their&#13;
portfolios even if, on account of high interest rates, those elements were not&#13;
leading to a financial loss.&#13;
1/   Several banks reported that once a loan had been in arrears for more&#13;
than two quarters, it was extremely difficult to retrieve. It is&#13;
important to spot arrears problems very early.&#13;
2/   One private commercial bank reported bad debts on two thirds of its&#13;
portfolio in a private small loans program introduced in the mid'&#13;
1970s, and had consequently closed it down. This was, moreover, for&#13;
short-term loans.&#13;
3/   Taking loans of 5 year maturity.&#13;
4T/  Note that this range is comparable to that often noted for loans in the&#13;
informal sector.&#13;
5/   See also Jaffee and Russell (1976), who however argue that the existence&#13;
of credit rationing does not depend on the particular shape of the&#13;
supply curve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
5.8       Hence a policy of simply letting interest rates float in and&#13;
of itself is unlikely to induce banks to lend to small businessmen out of&#13;
their own resources, except to a small and slowly growing minority of good&#13;
standing. 1/ This is the theoretical case for the risk-guarantee schemes and&#13;
direct financing by government banks discussed in Chapters 2 and 3; it is&#13;
essentially to'absorb the initial risks of financing small enterprises until&#13;
information and screening procedures have been developed within the institu-&#13;
tions, on the assumption that the programs will be profitable over the long-&#13;
run. Hence from a strictly economic point of view, such schemes are merited&#13;
only if&#13;
(i) the risks are in fact reducible over time; and&#13;
(ii) the net present value of the expected returns,&#13;
once the reductions have been achieved, exceeds&#13;
the net PV of losses during the adjustment period.&#13;
The latter presupposes a continuing volume of business from small enterprises&#13;
after the adjustment period. Consider these points further.&#13;
5.9       Changes in Risks and Administrative Costs Over Time.    It is conve-&#13;
nient to consider the probability of loans not being repaid in two parts:&#13;
p' = The probability of loans not being repaid from&#13;
known creditworthy borrowers; it would include&#13;
for instance losses due to uninsured personal mis-&#13;
fortunes (illness or injury, economic slumps, etc)&#13;
plus an allowance for 'human errors' on the part&#13;
of branch staff and/or the borrowers on the viability&#13;
of the project being appraised.&#13;
p" = The probability of loans not being repaid from borrowers&#13;
whose credit-worthiness is unknown or is more difficult&#13;
to ascertain.&#13;
In other words p" represents the probability of financing "lemons" on account&#13;
of their not being distinguishable, when the programs begin, from "good"&#13;
borrowers whose real risks to the institution, were they not otherwise confused&#13;
with the former, would be closer to p'.&#13;
5.10      No institution of course expects to be free from the risks repre-&#13;
sented by p'; but through a range of devices (collateral, diversification of&#13;
portfolios) and arrangements to check on credit-worthiness, they are kept to&#13;
low levels. To gauge from the percentages of bad debts and loans in arrears&#13;
on their portfolios, private sector institutions typically operate with a p'&#13;
of around 2% (often less) for short-term loans, and 3-4% for long term loans.&#13;
1/   The growth of savings deposits throughout the country is probably&#13;
establishing the credit standing of an increasing number of firms.&#13;
The interviews in Chapter 5 revealed that several firms had established&#13;
savings deposits precisely for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
The second category of risks are normally avoided simply by not lending; in&#13;
instances when it has been attempted, as discussed in Chapter 2, they have&#13;
been found to be alarmingly high (10 or more times the level of p') even when&#13;
the loans were fully collateralized; the reaction, at least among private&#13;
sector institutions, was to pull-out quickly. The questions to be discussed&#13;
below are thus: (i) is p" in fact reducible, and if so how is this accomplished&#13;
and over what length of time? and (ii) under what conditions is it economically&#13;
desirable to incur the losses when p" is high in the expectation of longer&#13;
run benefits once it is low?&#13;
5.11      Similarly, the administrative costs can be divided into two parts:&#13;
a', to represent the administrative costs of dealing with borrowers with&#13;
established credit ratings, and who are both familiar with and to the institu-&#13;
tion concerned; and a" the extra costs of dealing with new and unfamiliar&#13;
borrowers. The latter, like p", are expected to decline over time as the&#13;
volume of lending increases. The criterion (1) above is then (ignoring the&#13;
cross-product p'p" in the numerator):&#13;
r&gt; i + a'+ a" + p' + p"                 (2)&#13;
(l-p ) (1-p )&#13;
if lending is to be profitable at any point in time. (The multi-period&#13;
criterion will be considered shortly.)&#13;
5.12      Those who do not repay loans, except under the circumstances&#13;
discussed under p', vary greatly in competance and motivation. There has&#13;
been a tendency in the literature to classify them simply as "dishonest"&#13;
borrowers, though during interviews with borrowers themselves, or with&#13;
the branch staff of the banks who have made loans to them, it is apparent&#13;
that the degree of dishonesty varies greatly; furthermore, dishonesty is&#13;
not the most common cause of failure to repay. It is worth discussing this&#13;
point further since it helps to explain how institutions respond to the&#13;
risks faced. In particular, it is possible to classify those who do not&#13;
repay into four groups. First, of course, there are some borrowers, though&#13;
fortunately a small minority, who have no intention of repaying the loans&#13;
from the outset, and are correctly described as being dishonest. They&#13;
obtain the loans anticipating that foreclosure or making them repay will&#13;
be too troublesome or costly for the institution, or that repayments will&#13;
not be expected for reasons of collusion. This source or risk is reduced&#13;
by the development of internal control and credit checking procedures,&#13;
and the accumulation of knowledge among the staff in the branch networks&#13;
of the more trustworthy business people in the local communities. A second&#13;
and much more numerous type are those who are prepared to repay provided the&#13;
incentives to do so are sufficiently strong (the "honest if" types). In the&#13;
SMI program in the Philippines, there was a tendency initially among many&#13;
borrowers (of fully collateralized loans) not to take repayment seriously,&#13;
particularly when a large number of others were known not to be doing so (the&#13;
greater the number not repaying, the greater the tendency for others not to&#13;
repay). The reaction of some institutions to this situation, as one manager&#13;
put it, was to "flex muscles", by threatening foreclosure, publicising cases&#13;
under litigation, mounting loan collection drives, and simply by visiting the&#13;
borrowers more frequently as part of supervision to instill an awareness among&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
them that they were being watched. Although effects of these measures&#13;
took some time, they were probably responsible for halving the arrears&#13;
levels over the first five years of the program. They also show that p"&#13;
is not independent of a" (nor is p' of a'), though it is not a simple matter&#13;
to decide how much administrative effort is required. 1/&#13;
5.13      A commonly discussed incentive to be honest is the prospect of&#13;
subsequent loans, and is often thought to be an advantage of loans for working&#13;
capital over those for fixed capital. Stiglitz and Weiss (1980) consider this&#13;
non-price incentive, noting that "banks can exploit the desire of firms to&#13;
obtain loans by conditioning future loans on the repayment of past debts" and&#13;
adding that subsequent loans are generally less risky than the first. (The&#13;
significance of this incentive was also apparent in the interviews discussed&#13;
in Chapter 5 above.)    Elsewhere, Bottomley (1975) has argued that subsidized&#13;
interest rates provide an incentive to repay if subsequent loans are permitted,&#13;
since the borrowers have an obvious reason for remaining on good terms&#13;
with the institutions that offer them; this does not, of course, argue for&#13;
subsidized interest rate policies, but it does help to explain the low&#13;
arrears and default rates in administered credit schemes in some countries.&#13;
5.14      A third type not repaying the loans are perhaps best described&#13;
under the heading of "honest mistakes." Instances of these in the Philippines&#13;
were discussed in Chapter 4. In the early years of the program there was a&#13;
tendency to be too optimistic about the sales prospects of businesses to be&#13;
expanded under the loans, with costs and overheads being higher, and sales&#13;
lower and later, than anticipated. The reduction of risks of this type proved&#13;
to be a matter of experience: specifically, a knowledge of what happened to&#13;
previous projects after finance proved to be a valuable lesson for the loan&#13;
appraisers, who became stricter with subsequent loan requests, and better&#13;
counselors to the borrowers. 2/ A further source of risk under this heading,&#13;
and which is common in many countries besides the Philippines, is the over-&#13;
emphasis of fixed capital finance, and the under-emphasis (and sometimes&#13;
neglect) of working capital finance. Apart from a shortage of the latter&#13;
placing a financial stress on business expanded under the former, working&#13;
capital finance is inherently less risky to supply and would be consistent&#13;
with the theory behind the risk-guarantee and direct financing schemes (i.e.&#13;
to reduce p" so that long-run profitability is achieved).&#13;
5.15      Fourth and last, there are those who, however honest, prove not to&#13;
be successful or competent in their business (the honest "but" types). As in&#13;
other instances discussed above, a growing knowledge of local enterprises&#13;
within the branch networks helped to reduce this source of risk in the Philip-&#13;
pines. Given the higher turnover rates of small and very small firms, it was&#13;
also found to be important to finance businesses with proven records, 3/ and&#13;
most institutions interviewed now have stricter criteria for this.&#13;
1/   Obtaining and training qualified staff, in particular, can be a    problem.&#13;
See e.g. the figures of DBP's staffing, discussed in Chapter 2.&#13;
2/   Risks are also a function of size, type and maturity of loan and newness&#13;
of the business (see Chapter 4). Statistical analysis of risks often&#13;
helps institutions to develop better ground rules for lending.&#13;
3/   C.f. Chapter 4, in which it was found that financing new business&#13;
was about twice as risky as financing those already existing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
5.16      Similar observations about the changing nature of risks, and how&#13;
they may be reduced by various measures, or sometimss simply through knowledge&#13;
and experience, are also noted by Akerlof, 1/ who also stresses the importance&#13;
of knowledge of the local communities. He quotes several cases that are still&#13;
worth reading, including one regarding seasonal credits offered by cotton&#13;
ginning companies in Iran, in which "in the first years of operation large&#13;
losses (were to be) expected from unpaid debts - due to poor knowledge of the&#13;
local scene." It is nevertheless clear that the period required to reduce p"&#13;
(and also a") to comparatively low levels can be quite long, particularly if&#13;
the emphasis (which is excessive in our opinion) is placed on term loans. In&#13;
the first five years of the SMI program in the Philippines, for instance, the&#13;
probability of loans not being repaid has been reduced to less than one fourth&#13;
of the levels originally experienced, 2/ but it is still significantly higher&#13;
than private banks would consider to be acceptable.&#13;
5.17      A Forward-Looking Financial Criterion.    The decision to initiate a&#13;
program is profitable if the present worth of the annual returns exceeds the&#13;
present worth of the losses represented by p" and a" during the adjustment&#13;
period.  If the volume of lending in any year t is Q    and c is the opportu-&#13;
nity cost of resources to the institution expressed as a yield or an interest&#13;
rate, 3/ this criterion is:-&#13;
E (l+r)(l-p')(l-p")   Q_(l+i)+a'+a"          Q            (3)&#13;
t      (l+c)t          t   t   (l+c)           t&#13;
Rearranging (3), and neglecting the cross-product p'p", 4/ lending to&#13;
small enterprises is likely to be profitable over the long haul if the&#13;
interest rates on loans are allowed to rise such that&#13;
(i+a +p') + [ 5(a"+p")Q /(l+c) ] -  [EQ /(1+c) ]&#13;
t           ~~~~~t&#13;
r &gt;                                                           (4)&#13;
(l-p') - [p"Qt /(l+c) I      -] [EQt /(l+c) )&#13;
1/   Op. cit. pp. 246-249.&#13;
2/   This happened in two ways.   One through the reduction of arrears within&#13;
DBP, and the other through IGLF lending becoming more concentrated in&#13;
institutions prepared to develop the procedures and expertise. See&#13;
Chapter 2.&#13;
3/ In practice c and i are probably quite close.&#13;
4/ Including it does not affect the substance of the argument.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
5.18      The second terms in the numerator and denominator represent the&#13;
losses during the adjustment period. Both are present worthed and weighted by&#13;
the volume of business; both are also divided by the present worth of the&#13;
volume of business. The terms involving p" and a" are summed over the period&#13;
over which these quantities are significant. As discussed above, this is not&#13;
necessarily a short period; it is, however, shorter than the period over&#13;
which the denominators should be summed.    If Qt expands rapidly, the&#13;
second terms are likely to be small, and conversely if Qt does not.&#13;
Hence the likelihood of establishing a profitable lending program turns in an&#13;
obvious manner on one's assessment of the role of small enterprises in the&#13;
economy and on the growth of their demand for institutional credit.&#13;
5.19      The limiting case of (4) occurs at high rates of growth of demand&#13;
and/or when a" and p" decline to low levels over a comparatively short period.&#13;
It then approaches:&#13;
&gt;        i + a' + p(5)&#13;
1 - p&#13;
(Note that the static case, given by (2) above, yields the same result&#13;
if a" and p" are written as declining functions of Q.) It also approaches&#13;
this level the more the losses due to a" and p" are cushioned by the risk-&#13;
guarantees and the spreads on government backed financing schemes, such as&#13;
were reviewed in Chapters 2 and 3.&#13;
5.20      In those Chapters it was revealed that there remains little long-run&#13;
interest on the part of the private sector institutions in the Philippines to&#13;
develop lending programs to small enterprises, even though the losses from a"&#13;
and p" are being cushioned as described. The basic reason for this is that,&#13;
under the current administered interest rate policies, even the less stringent&#13;
criterion, (5) above, is not being met.&#13;
5.21      Interest Rates and Government-Backed Financing Schemes.     Supposing&#13;
there was a high volume of demand for credit. Interest rates corresponding&#13;
to (4) or (5) would not need to rise to the extreme levels previously estimated&#13;
(from (1)), sufficient to depress the demand and extinguish any institutional&#13;
interest in meeting the demand. In this case the arguments for the schemes&#13;
are no longer strictly economic or financial in nature:&#13;
(i)  Even small differentials in interest rates between small and&#13;
large borrowers may be resisted politically, except perhaps&#13;
those that can be accomodated under reductions,within an&#13;
otherwise uniform structure, for prime borrowers. As noted&#13;
earlier, the private financial institutions may face this&#13;
constraint in the absence of any ceilings set by the govern-&#13;
ment. In this case the schemes become a device for narrowing&#13;
differentials, and are a "second best" measure from an economic&#13;
viewpoint.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
(ii)  Perceptions differ between the public and private sector&#13;
as to the extent and growth of small enterprises and the&#13;
growth of demand for credit over the long-run. 1/ In this&#13;
case the schemes are a device for promoting investments&#13;
in regions and activities in which the public sector expects a&#13;
satisfactory return to the economy but in which the private&#13;
financial sector has doubts.&#13;
(iii)  While the private sector bases its projects on expected&#13;
returns adjusted for risks, these adjustments may be larger&#13;
than is economically efficient in the absence of institutions&#13;
or mechanisms to insure against risks. 2/ 3/ There is then a&#13;
function for the public sector to step in with guarantees or&#13;
other forms of subsidy of its own. 4/&#13;
Other and perhaps more familiar reasons put forward are (iv) the schemes&#13;
are necessary to offset institutional biasses in favor of lending to large&#13;
scale arising from the structure of ownership and control of industry and&#13;
finance; (v) small enterprises have special advantages over large scale; 5/&#13;
and (vi) the schemes have a redistributive aim by raising the demand&#13;
for labor in low income regions.&#13;
1/   Given the limited information and understanding on the extent and changes&#13;
in the size and regional distributions of industrial development, these&#13;
differences of perception can be huge. E.g. infrastructure improvements&#13;
and agricultural growth have been shown in this report to increase small&#13;
business activity in the present stage of development in the Philippines.&#13;
But an entirely opposite view is still quite prevalent, and until recently&#13;
had some theoretical support (see Anderson and Leiserson (1980) for a&#13;
review): this is that such developments lead to an increasing demand&#13;
for externally manufactured goods and a rapid decline of local small&#13;
scale industries all round.&#13;
2/   Arrow and Lind (1970), who further argue that the public sector's decisions&#13;
should be neutral to risk, given its size. For a less conclusive view,&#13;
however, see the comments of Foldes and Rees (1977) on Arrow and Lind's&#13;
paper.&#13;
3/   One mechanism often conspicuous by its absence is a means for sharing&#13;
records between institutions on borrowers, so as to provide additional&#13;
checks on creditworthiness. In several instances in the Philippines&#13;
we encountered borrowers who were in default with one institution but&#13;
who were still able to obtain credit from another.&#13;
4/   Mayshar (1977).&#13;
5/   Although the advantages of SSEs are the most touted reasons for interven-&#13;
tion, interventions would arguably not be needed to secure an efficient&#13;
flow of capital to SSEs were it not for (i) to (iv) and the transactions&#13;
costs (discussed in Chapter 4) faced by most owners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
Externalities, Economies of Scale and Interest Rates&#13;
5.22      The criteria (2) and (4) above were both financial, leading to&#13;
an interest rate capable of covering the average costs of providing loans&#13;
(or a present worth weighted average of costs in the multi-period case).&#13;
Two factors that modify these criteria from an economic standpoint are:&#13;
(a) the probability of financing a "good" borrower rises the&#13;
greater the volume of borrowing that is undertaken, though the&#13;
rise is less marked the closer (l-p") approaches unity;&#13;
(b) the marginal administrative costs of financing loans are below&#13;
average costs, the latter declining with the volume of lending;&#13;
i.e. there are economies of scale. As in (i), however, the&#13;
gains from scale diminish at higher volumes of lending.&#13;
Both suggest a modification of (2) and (4) and lead to results that converge&#13;
more rapidly towards (5) as demand rises.&#13;
5.23      Simple Static Case.   Let B represent the benefits of financing&#13;
"good" borrowers, excluding any losses due to the "natural" risks denoted&#13;
above by p'. B would thus be the area under the demand curve up to Q,&#13;
and DB/3Q = (l+r). The actual benefits would then be B times the probability&#13;
of losses due to natural risks (l-p') and the probability of finding a&#13;
"good" borrower (l-p"). The net benefits are then:&#13;
(l-p)B - (l+i+a)Q&#13;
But both p and 'a' change with lending experience, that is with Q, and&#13;
the marginal conditions are:&#13;
(l-p)(l+r) - B3p/IQ-(l+i+a)-QDa/9Q = 0&#13;
from which&#13;
r =  R JB. ap +Q.@Q} aa p1(6)&#13;
the first term (which is negative) in the bracketed expression represents&#13;
the marginal benefits of finding a good borrower the greater the volume&#13;
of business undertaken, and the second (also negative) the benefits of&#13;
scale. The former appears to correspond to the external benefits identified&#13;
by Arrow (1965) in a growth model that examined the economic implications of&#13;
"learning by doing." Here learning was associated with the cumulative produc-&#13;
tion of capital goods, from which he concluded: 1/&#13;
1/   Op.cit, p. 168.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
"the presence of learning means that an act of&#13;
investment benefits future investors, but this&#13;
benefit is not paid for by the market. Hence, it&#13;
is to be expected that the aggregate amount of&#13;
investment under the competitive model .......will&#13;
fall short of the socially optimum level."&#13;
The term is given intuitive meaning in figure 1, in which the lower demand&#13;
curve corresponds to a lower probability of finding a good borrower than&#13;
the higher demand curve.   If the initial price is P1 and demand Q , the&#13;
demand would rise to Q ' say, if the price were dropped to P    on Ithe assump-&#13;
tion that meeting the increase of demand, Q'2 - Q1, made no difference to the&#13;
institution's ability to finance good borrowers. If, however, the extra&#13;
experience gained with extra lending eventually makes a difference, the&#13;
actual demand met would rise, say to Q2.   Even if P2 fell below the current&#13;
marginal cost of making the loan, the extra benefits generated,(shown by the&#13;
vertically shaded area) may be sufficient to offset the losses (shown by&#13;
the cross shaded area). It is apparent that the case for setting prices&#13;
below marginal costs diminishes the less (l-p) increases with an increase&#13;
in demand.&#13;
5.24      One possibility that arises is where the extra "good" borrowers&#13;
that are found as (l-p) rises are always marginal, i.e. that the vertically&#13;
shaded area in Figure 1 is always small. At high levels of Q is this likely,&#13;
but not at low levels, corresponding to the cases considered by Akerlof,&#13;
when potentially "good" borrowers are indistinguishable from the "lemons".&#13;
5.25      The first term on the RHS of (6) is the same as (2), 1/ so the&#13;
economic criterion suggests lower interest rates than the financial criterion&#13;
so long as there are significant benefits to be obtained from learning and&#13;
from economies of scale. The limiting cases of both (2) and (6) are the&#13;
same, 2/ however: p tends to p', a to a', ap/aQ to 0 and aa/aQ to 0 as Q&#13;
rises, so that r tends to (i + a' + p')/(l-p-). For instance, take the case&#13;
where learning and economies of scale both show diminishing returns. One&#13;
pattern might be: 3/&#13;
p    p " e    Q&#13;
a"   a.. e     Q&#13;
a' = a "e&#13;
0&#13;
1/   The "static" financial case.&#13;
2/   Also the same as the forward looking financial case.&#13;
3/   Arrow considers a case 0(Q) = 0 Q    with n &gt; 0.   But whether this or&#13;
the exponential form is assumed, the results are similar.&#13;

5.26       The Dynamic Case.   All quantities that vary with time are given&#13;
the subscript t, including r, i, p and a. The present worth of benefits,&#13;
if x is the discount rate, is then:&#13;
Z(l-pt)Bt/(l+x)  - z (1+it+a dQt/(l+x)'&#13;
t                  t&#13;
where   B t/aQt = (1+rt) and both Pt and a   are each a function of the&#13;
cumulative experience - assumed here to te correlated with the cumulative&#13;
volume of lending - up to time t; that is&#13;

and&#13;

Taking the marginal conditions of the above objectives function and&#13;

the series:&#13;

The first term in the bracketed expression is the present worth of the&#13;
marginal benefits of finding "good" borrowers in the future on account&#13;
of the extra experience gained in the present period; the second term reflects&#13;
the gains from economies of scale.   As in the static case, there is a downwards&#13;
adjustment to the marginal costs of providing the loans in the present period.&#13;
5.27      The limiting case is again the same as that for the financial&#13;
criterion (4).  Both at and Pt tend to a' and p' as the cumulative volume&#13;
of lending rises, with ap /aQ and Da /3Q tending to zero, so that&#13;

The contrast between (4) and (7) is iLlustrated in Figure 2. The economic&#13;
criterion implies lower interest rates than the forward looking financial&#13;
criterion during the adjustment period.&#13;
5.28      The above results raise the question, is there an economic case&#13;
for subsidy, in addition to points (i) to (vi) raised in paragraph 5.21,&#13;
when a" and p" are large?    If there is, it is probably not a strong case,&#13;
since economies of scale are evident (and possibly greater) in many other&#13;
sectors, while Arrow suggests that learning by doing is widespread. There&#13;
may be a case for subsidising investment in general, or for selected sub-&#13;
sidies in sectors where the economies of scale and learning by doing are&#13;
most marked; these may or may not include small business credit programs.&#13;
The most appropriate answer, perhaps, is that economic analysis does not&#13;
argue against subsidy during the adjustment period.&#13;

6. SMALL INDUSTRIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
6.1       The purpose of this chapter is to present material of an essentially&#13;
factual or descriptive nature on small industries, and which is often needed&#13;
when deciding on the economic desirability of various policies. If, for&#13;
instance, small industries were declining everywhere because people were&#13;
demanding the types of mass-produced goods that could only be produced effi-&#13;
ciently by large scale, this would have rather different implications to&#13;
evidence that showed them to be highly responsive to the growth of markets,&#13;
and an increasing source of output and employment. As seen earlier, it is&#13;
generally assumed that the latter is a much better description of small in-&#13;
dustries in the Philippines than the former, and it was     this assumption&#13;
among others that led to the SMI program being introduced in 1974. The evi-&#13;
dence has not been thoroughly documented, however, and in addition a range of&#13;
questions are commonly asked about small industries:   Are they declining in&#13;
some sectors-and rising in others? Which kinds of small industries should&#13;
the programs support? What proportion grow through the size structure and&#13;
become medium or large scale industries? What proportions remain as they&#13;
are or fail? What are their sources of finance? At what point does their&#13;
demand for institutional finance, as opposed to trade credits or a sole&#13;
dependence on retained earnings become significant? What is the nature of&#13;
their markets, and are their markets being eroded by large scale as infra-&#13;
structure is improved and transport costs decline?&#13;
6.2       These are only examples of the kinds of questions that are raised&#13;
about small industries and their supporting programs. Any attempt to be com-&#13;
prehensive is bound to lead to huge surveys and questionnaires to supplement&#13;
what can be gleaned from census and establishment data. In the present study&#13;
we therefore concentrated on a few questions that seemed to be particularly&#13;
significant, drawing on the census and establishment data, and on interviews&#13;
held with 80 firms to ascertain something from the perceptions of their&#13;
owners:&#13;
(i)  What is the extent and growth of employment in&#13;
various scales of manufacturing activity?&#13;
(ii) Do the patterns differ between sectors, and if&#13;
so, in which sectors are they declining and in&#13;
which are they expanding?&#13;
(iii)  Is it true that the emergence and growth of small&#13;
industries is most marked in the agricultural&#13;
provinces? and again, what kinds of structural&#13;
changes are taking place - e.g., are they displacing&#13;
traditional forms of off-farm employment?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
(iv) Finally, there are questions about small industries&#13;
at the firm level, regarding product markets, origins&#13;
and growth, turnover rates and sources of finance.&#13;
These questions are discussed below respectively under the following headings:&#13;
aggregate changes in the size distribution, sectoral trends and patterns,&#13;
regional distributions,and some firm level data.&#13;
6.3       Since it is necessary to present a lot of tabular and statistical&#13;
detail in the present chapter, a summary is provided at the end, together with&#13;
a brief assessment of the role of small industries in the development process&#13;
in the Philippines (paragraphs 6.49 et. seq.). If anything, not enough is&#13;
known about small industries at the firm level, and the section dealing with&#13;
(iv) ought to be longer. However, the results of more comprehensive inter-&#13;
views than the ones we were able to undertak'e must await further study. 1/&#13;
Census and Establishment Data: Sources and Definitions&#13;
6.4       A distinction is drawn between&#13;
- household manufacturing activities,&#13;
- small manufacturing establishments and workshops&#13;
employing less than 10 or 20 workers, 2/ and&#13;
- establishments employing over 10 or 20 workers,&#13;
and often referred to as the factory sector.&#13;
Establishments in the factory sector are often classified into small, medium&#13;
and large factories, and its size structure is also examined below where the&#13;
data permit.&#13;
6.5       Employment in household manufacturing is estimated in the usual&#13;
way as the difference between the estimates of manufacturing employment&#13;
provided in the population censuses or (in inter-census years) the labor&#13;
force surveys, and those provided in the censuses of establishments.. The&#13;
latter includes any manufacturing activity at "a fixed location and having&#13;
permanency of assets such as goods for resale, materials, products, equip-&#13;
ment; etc., in its premises;" activities not thus counted are generally&#13;
those that take place within the households. In the establishment census&#13;
years, all establishments with one or more workers are counted, but in the&#13;
1/   There is a recent and very useful study by Itao (1980) of the University&#13;
of the 'Philippines' Institute for Small Scale Industries on enterprise&#13;
failure rates, and which is discussed further below. The studies in&#13;
India and Colombia under the present research project (RPO 671-59) go&#13;
into firm level data more thoroughly.&#13;
2/   In the census years, the NCSO classify manufacturing employment into&#13;
enterprises with less than 10 workers, and enterprises with 10 or more.&#13;
In the establishment survey years, the classification used is 5-19&#13;
workers, and 20 or more workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
survey years (between censuses) only those with five or more. Since establish-&#13;
ments and workshops with less than five workers are quite numerous, ignoring&#13;
them leads to an underestimate of employment in small non-household enterprises,&#13;
so the census data are used as far as possible.&#13;
6.6       Apart from differing in scale, the three groups also differ greatly&#13;
in their use of labor and in their product markets. Staley and Morse (1966)&#13;
note that household activities include artisanal homework, the manufacture of&#13;
items for consumption or use by the family, and the manufacture of goods for&#13;
industry and trade under the "putting out" or dispersed factory system. But&#13;
perhaps the most distinguishing feature is their use of family labor; in the&#13;
Philippines three out of four workers in household manufacturing are family&#13;
workers. Small establishments (with less than 20 workers) market a larger&#13;
share of their output, make more use of hired labor, and are generally owned&#13;
and run full-time by the family's main income earner. Thus while household&#13;
manufacturing is commonly a secondary source of family income, manufacturing&#13;
in small establishments is commonly the primary source. Factory activities&#13;
make a much greater use of hired labor, and of management, clerical and&#13;
supervisory staff.&#13;
Aggregate Changes in Size Distribution Over Time&#13;
6.7       Household activities are still the largest source of employment&#13;
in Philippine manufacturing. But their share in manufacturing employment&#13;
declined from about 75% 1/in the mid fifties, to 63% in the mid sixties,&#13;
to less than 55% in the mid seventies (Table 6.1), and may be entering a&#13;
period of decline in absolute terms. They are however likely to remain&#13;
an important source of earnings for the labor force for some time, and&#13;
their current employment of 900 thousand is approximately five times the&#13;
employment in small and medium factory based industries (of about 20 to&#13;
200 workers) to which the Small and Medium Industries Program is addressed.&#13;
6.8       A noticeable feature of the size structure is the extent and&#13;
growth of employment in the smaller size groups; e.g., establishments with&#13;
less than 20 employees have been significantly faster growing sources of&#13;
employment than any other size group since the mid 1960s, and indeed this&#13;
is true for small and medium establishments as a whole (up to, say, 200&#13;
employees) compared to large scale. The same patterns are apparent when&#13;
examining the net formation rates of small and medium establishments&#13;
(Table 6.2).&#13;
1/   This figure is based on the residual between the labor force and&#13;
establishment surveys for 1956. The residual (which came to 80%)&#13;
was adjusted downwards by 5% to allow for firms with 1 to 4 workers.&#13;

Some of the recorded increases could of course be due to improvements in&#13;
the enumeration procedures of the NCSO, though it is difficult to know how&#13;
to allow for this. The measurement errors in the second smallest category&#13;
(10 to 20 workers), on the other hand, are probably quite low, since such&#13;
enterprises are more visible, and less susceptible to counting errors;&#13;
here too the net rates of formation have been high. 1/&#13;
6.9        The above Table also indicates quite high rates of "emergence"&#13;
of small and medium factory establishments employing 10 to 200 workers,&#13;
confirming an assumption of the SMI program that it is servicing a growing&#13;
sector. The growth of employment in such establishments averaged about 5.1%&#13;
per year during 1967-75, and was systematically higher than for employment in&#13;
large factories.&#13;
Sectoral Patterns and Trends in the Size Distribution&#13;
6.10      The rising share of manufacturing employment in workshops and&#13;
factories in the Philippines, and the declining share in household activi-&#13;
ties, follow the trends observed for other countries. As in other countries,&#13;
1/   The NCSO's Annual Surveys of Manufacturing establishments also indicate&#13;
high net rates of formation in the 5-20 size range. The number increased&#13;
from 7,200 in 1960 to 13,300 in 1974, a growth rate of 4.5% per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
however, the trends differ both in magnitude and in sign between sectors,&#13;
as shown in Table 6.3; employment in household activities may be declining&#13;
rapidly, stagnating, or increasing rapidly, depending on the sector being&#13;
considered.  In food processing household activities have entered a period of&#13;
rapid decline in favor of both small and large scale mechanized activities.&#13;
In textiles, employment in households appears to have peaked, and it is large&#13;
scale manufacturing that is providing most of the labor absorption. Similarly&#13;
in wearing apparel household employment seems to have peaked, though at a very&#13;
high level, but here it is small scale activities (particularly tailoring and&#13;
seamstressing) that are providing most of the new employment opportunities.&#13;
In the engineering sectors (metal, mechanical and electrical products and&#13;
transport equipment) household employment has increased rapidly along with&#13;
employment in workshops and in both small and large factories.&#13;
6.11      Further analysis of household employment is made difficult by an&#13;
almost total absence of relevant information, other than the two-digit data&#13;
provided in the population census years. The only documented information&#13;
that is available is provided in a survey undertaken by NACIDA in the&#13;
region of Ilocos in Northern Luzon in 1977. 1/ Since over 80% of the&#13;
region's population are rural, the survey covered a large proportion of&#13;
off-farm activities such as piggeries and poultry, as shown in Table 6.4.&#13;
Otherwise, the data show similar patterns to the two-digit data in Table&#13;
6.3, with a large proportion of workers being in garment craft and weaving,&#13;
metal and wood crafts, and various handicrafts based on bamboo, ceramics&#13;
and others. There was also some evidence of investment and growth in the&#13;
activities surveyed; asset levels per worker averaged about P 1,500 ($200)&#13;
and apparently most households had invested further in the activities after&#13;
1/   The survey aimed at obtaining a 100% coverage of all cottage industries&#13;
in the region; the estimates of people engaged in manufacturing employ-&#13;
ment were quite close to those of the population censuses.    NACIDA's&#13;
estimates of employment in cottage industries in the region were 68,000;&#13;
in 1975 the labor force in manufacturing was 70,000 according to the&#13;
regional volumes of the population census, of which about 6,000 would&#13;
be in establishments of over 20 workers (see ASM for 1974).&#13;

L Note that there are quite large irregularities in the&#13;
household employment data: the figure for 1967 and&#13;
1975 (preliminary) are over 800 thousand; see Table 6. 2,&#13;
Sources:  The basic data for the estimates are provided by&#13;
the Population Censuses of 1960 and 1975 and the&#13;
Manufacturing Censuses of 1961 and 1972. Since&#13;
no two-digit breakdown of total employment is&#13;
available other than in the Population Census&#13;
years, the following procedure was used to estimate&#13;
household employment. The percentage distribution&#13;
of the labor force among the two digit classi&#13;
fication shown were calculated from the Population&#13;
Censuses for 1960 and 1975, the former distribution&#13;
was then applied to the total labor force in&#13;
manufacturing for 1961 and the latter to the total&#13;
labor force in 1972. The Manufacturing Censuses&#13;
gives the data for less than 10 and 10 or more&#13;
employees; household employment is then calculated&#13;
as a residual. A similar exercise using the 1967&#13;
Manufacturing and the 1970 Population Censuses was&#13;
not done on account of apparent inconsistencies&#13;
in the data an female employment in clothing and&#13;

they were started. 1/ While most of the growth has stemmed from the growth of&#13;
local markets (as with piggeries, poultry, metalcraft and food preservation)&#13;
certain traditional handicrafts (bamboo, garments, needlecraft and ceramics)&#13;
have benefitted from a fourfold increase in the export markets for cottage&#13;
industry products in recent years. 2/&#13;
6.12      The data in Table 6.3 suggest that the net shift away from house-&#13;
hold manufacturing is occurring towards both small and large manufacturing&#13;
establishments with the pattern again varying between sectors. An attempt&#13;
is made to show the pattern in more detail in Table 6.5, which presents&#13;
data for 29 industries at the 5-digit level. The industries shown accounted&#13;
for 98% of employment in establishments with less than 10 workers in 1972,&#13;
and 92% of employment in establishments with 10 or more workers. They have&#13;
been divided into three groups in order to identify the sectors in which the&#13;
movement out of household is: (A) Mainly towards very small establishments&#13;
(with less than 10 workers); (B) mainly towards larger establishments (with&#13;
10 or more workers); 3/ (C) towards both larger and very small establishments.&#13;
In summary, the growth rates and percentage shares in employment (in manufac-&#13;
turing establishments) for the three categories are as follows:&#13;
Movement of Employment % Total Employment (1972) Growth Rates (1967-77)&#13;
Mainly Towards:-             Small      Large          Small       Large&#13;

1/   The investments were mostly self-financed, though a surprisingly large&#13;
number appear to be turning to financial institutions for credit. In a&#13;
subsample of 7,000 households over 1,500 (or 22%) had obtained loans from&#13;
financial institutions; 65% financed their own investments; the other 13%&#13;
had used informal sources and now a defunct credit facility offered by&#13;
NACIDA. The institutional sources were not identified in the sample,&#13;
but they probably include Rural Banks (which offer short-term loans for&#13;
poultry and piggeries), the small loans facilities of the Private Devel-&#13;
opment Banks, and the small "home" and "cottage" industry loan facilities&#13;
of DBP and PNB respectively; for reasons discussed in Chapter II, they&#13;
are unlikely to include the private commercial banks.&#13;

terms "very small" and "larger" establishments are used in this and the&#13;

6.13      Most of (A) appear to be activities in which small enterprises&#13;
derive advantages by concentrating on local markets - bakeries, tailoring&#13;
and dressmaking, furniture, structural concrete products and fabricated&#13;
metal products. Rice milling is the only exception in that it serves both&#13;
local and national markets, though small scale activities presumably derive&#13;
some advantage from being close to their sources of supply. A large propor-&#13;
tion of small activities are also located in the provinces, 1/ and are likely&#13;
to face increasing competition from large scale (e.g. in tailoring, dress-&#13;
making and furniture) as transport and marketing costs decline with improve-&#13;
ments in the country s infrastructure. Most of (B), in contrast, serve&#13;
large markets - e.g., cotton and rayon textiles, sugar milling, plywood,&#13;
chemicals, steel,basic metal and the manufacture of machinery and trans-&#13;
port equipment - and the economies of scale are probably strong enough to&#13;
offset the higher transport and marketing costs of centralized production.&#13;
Most of (C) are in an intermediate category itt which the trade-offs between&#13;
economies of scale and transport and marketing costs probably vary signi-&#13;
ficantly with location, and with the type of quality of product; 2/ they&#13;
include for instance foundries, furnaces and mills; knitting mills; meat,&#13;
fish and dairy products; printing of books, periodicals and papers; book-&#13;
bindings; rattan furniture; and other.&#13;
6.14      The census data are neither sufficient nor reliable enough for&#13;
a quantitative analysis of the relationships suggested in the previous&#13;
paragraph, and special surveys would be required into production techno-&#13;
logies and costs, product design and qualities, and marketing and transport&#13;
costs in order to provide further clarifications. The above data suggest&#13;
that small and large scale firms generally have a non-competing relation-&#13;
ship,with each tending to concentrate on those products in which it holds&#13;
a distinct economic advantage over the other. These advantages vary with&#13;
location (i.e., with transport and marketing costs) and with the type of&#13;
product. A more detailed breakdown of the size structure might of course&#13;
reveal more competition between the larger-end of small scale, and the&#13;
medium and large scale manufactures; though again, thc infrastructure condi-&#13;
tions may also be protecting even medium scale manufacturing in the provinces.&#13;
What can be said at present is, first, that four-fifths of establishment-based&#13;
employment is either (a) in sectors in which very small activities are growing&#13;
rapidly, while the larger scale are declining, or (b) in which the converse&#13;
is true. Second, it is likely that improvements in infrastructure in the&#13;
provinces, and the growth of markets, will both act to draw small and large&#13;
1/   In both (A) and (C).&#13;
2/   The data in Table 6.5 are at the five-digit level, and are thus not&#13;
detailed enough for analysis of product type and quality.&#13;

scale into greater competition in some sectors. 1/ And third, anticipating&#13;
the interview data presented below on the growth of small firms through the&#13;
size structure, that competition will occur as much from the emergence and&#13;
growth of small as from the expansion of already large enterprises.&#13;
Regional Distributions&#13;
6.15      Approximately two-thirds of manufacturing employment in the&#13;
Philippines is in the agricultural provinces, of which 60% is in households.&#13;
It is in the agricultural provinces, however, where the share in household&#13;
employment is declining most rapidly, and where there is a movement of labor&#13;
into large and small manufacturing establishments in local urban centers.&#13;
The movement - and with it, the growth of the regional urban base - is most&#13;
rapid in those regions where agricultural development is most rapid and&#13;
broadly-based, and can be explained by two factors: agriculture's influence&#13;
on the regional product and labor markets, and the advantages of localized&#13;
production for certain classes of manufactured goods. The following section&#13;
presents some data on these changes, the influence of agriculture being taken&#13;
up in the next chapter. First, however, it is necessary to say something&#13;
about the urban base - of villages, towns and regional cities - that exists&#13;
outside Manila, and which in some regions is developing rapidly, providing a&#13;
basis for the regional development of both small and large industries.&#13;
(i) Urban-Rural Population Data&#13;
6.16      Slightly over one-third of the population currently live in urban&#13;
areas, which in the Philippines are defined so as to include small villages&#13;
and towns. 2/ Castillo (1977) has described the extensive network of towns&#13;
1/   Staley and Morse (1966) observed a tendency when this happens for the&#13;
two to become reorganized into a less-competitive and more complementary&#13;
relationship.  The examples they cite include the emergence of small-scale&#13;
maintenance, repair and installation services for large-scale's products.&#13;
2/   The NCSO definitions include:   (1) All cities and municipalities having&#13;
a population density of at least 1,000 persons per square Km; (2) Cen-&#13;
tral districts of municipalities with a population density of at least&#13;
500 persons per square Km; (3) Central districts having a recognizable&#13;
street pattern, at least six establishments engaged in manufacturing,&#13;
commerce or service activities, and at least three of the following:&#13;
(i) a town hall, church or chapel with religious services at least once&#13;
a month, (ii) a public plaza, park or cemetery, (iii) a market place or&#13;
building where trading activities are carried on once or more a week, or&#13;
(iv) a public building like a school, health center or library. Also&#13;
included are barangays having 1,000 inhabitants or more in which con-&#13;
dition (3) is met and where the occupation of the inhabitants is pre-&#13;
dominantly non-farming or fishing. All other areas are considered&#13;
rural.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
and villages in the countryside in which there are 40,111 barangays (the&#13;
smallest unit of government at the village level), 522 municipalities,&#13;
60 cities and '72 provinces; in 1970 there were over 400 provincial towns&#13;
with populations of less than 20,000 inhabitants. The 1970 distribution&#13;
of population among rural and the various sizes of urban areas is shown&#13;
in Table 6.6. The percentage of people counted as living in rural areas is&#13;
evidently quite sensitive to the definitions of urban and rural. UN defi-&#13;
nitions include villages and towns with 20,000 inhabitants or less in their&#13;
estimates of the rural population on the grounds that such centers for the&#13;
most part are servicing rural areas. Applying this definition to the Philip-&#13;
pines in 1970 would raise the rural population estimates from 68% to 80% of&#13;
the total population.&#13;
6.17      From the viewpoint of the present study three other demographic&#13;
features should be noted:&#13;
-    the still high rate of population absorption in rural&#13;
areas; two-thirds of total population growth occurred in&#13;
rural areas over the period 1960-75;&#13;
-    the spread of urban growth across a large number of urban&#13;
centers ranging in size from a few thousand inhabitants&#13;
to over 4 million in Manila.&#13;
-    the wide variations in urban growth rates in regions&#13;
outside Manila.&#13;
Data on the first two features are shown in Table 6.7. Outside Manila,&#13;
the aggregate values shown in the Table conceal growth rates varying from&#13;
near-zero or negative values in some provincial towns and cities, to 4 to&#13;
6% and higher in others. 1/&#13;
(ii) Manufacturing Employment in Urban and Rural Areas&#13;
6.18      The distribution of manufacturing employment is also shown in&#13;
Table 6.6; approximately 52% was in rural areas in 1970, 27% in provincial&#13;
towns and cities, and 21' in Metro-Manila. There are several reasons for&#13;
thinking that the share in rural areas is declining, though it is not possible&#13;
to detect this in the series shown in Table 6.8.&#13;

Sources and basis of Estimates:&#13;
Compiled from 1970 Population Census, National Summary, Volume II,&#13;
Tables I-5 and I-6. The distribution of manufacturing employment is esti-&#13;
mated as follows. The Census provides the urban-rural breakdown. For urban&#13;
centers of less than 10,000 about 2.2% of the population are employed in&#13;
manufacturing; for those of 10-20 thousand, 5.2%; and for centers with over&#13;
20,000, 7.2%. The first two of these percentages were obtained from the&#13;
provincial 1975 census volumes (we did not have access to the 1970 volumes)&#13;
for Agusan del Sur, Aklan, Antique, Catanduanes, Bukidnon, Ifugao and Lanao&#13;
del Norte, whose average urban populations were less than 10,000 in 1970; and&#13;
Laguna, Misamis Oriental, Negros Occidental, Nueva Ecija and South Cotabato&#13;
whose combined average urban population was about 15,000 in 1970. The 7.2%&#13;
for centers with over 20,000 is calculated as a residual. These provinces&#13;
were used as a data base (a) on account of the sizes of their towns and (b)&#13;
to provide a broad geographical coverage.&#13;

6.19      The still high share of manufacturing employment in rural areas&#13;
is surprising. It probably reflects the point that, for rural families,&#13;
manufacturing is a secondary ("off-farm") activity, undertaken mostly by&#13;
women, and which for this reason has to be combined with farm-work and&#13;
domestic duties. 1/ Notwithstanding the network of towns in the country,&#13;
access between farm and town is still time consuming in most regions, and&#13;
it is not possible for women to "commute" to local towns in search of&#13;
secondary earnings in commerce or manufacturing establishments. 2/ Conse-&#13;
quently, the majority of rural manufacturing activities are undertaken&#13;
within the household.&#13;
6.20      The lack of data and descriptive material 3/ limits what can be&#13;
said about manufacturing activities within rural households and their role&#13;
in enhancing rural incomes. They are, however, declining in importance in&#13;
favor of wage employment in establishment-based, non-farm activities in the&#13;
provincial towns and cities. At a general level, they can be divided into&#13;
two kinds: the production of articles for own use, which is declining&#13;
rapidly according to the data in Annex Table 6.1; and the production of&#13;
articles for sale, which is declining slowly. 4/ Consider also changes in&#13;
the types of employment undertaken by women, who provide two-thirds of the&#13;
labor force in manufacturing activities in rural areas (c.f. one-third in&#13;
urban areas). 5/ Nine-tenths of the women recorded as being in rural manu-&#13;
facturing are working in textiles and wearing apparel; 6/ household employ-&#13;
ment in both of these sectors has peaked according to the evidence discussed&#13;
above (Table 6.3) in favor of rising employment in large establishments in&#13;
the case of textiles ai,d small establishments in the case of wearing apparel.&#13;
Furthermore, women are shifting increasingly out of manufacturing into&#13;
commerce and services. Between 1956 and 1976, their participation rate in&#13;
the labor force remained about constant, but their occupational distribution&#13;
1/   Evenson, Popkin and King-Quizon (1979).&#13;
2/   The root mean distance between the 472 towns with less than 50,000&#13;
inhabitants (Table 6.6) is over 16 kilometers in cultivated areas.&#13;
(Cultivated area is 12 million hectares).&#13;
3/   Such as provided on farmers in Mrs. Castillo's (1977) excellent study&#13;
of provinces in the Philippines.&#13;
4,   In Manila, in contrast, household manufacturing of this kind is rising&#13;
rapidly (Annex Table 6.1). See also para. 6.12 below on the growth of&#13;
the urban informal sector.&#13;

changed as follows: in manufacturing, a decline from 8.0 to 5.2%; in govern-&#13;
ment services a rise from 1.7 to 4.6%; in commerce, a rise from 6.1 to 7.1%&#13;
and in personal services a rise from 4.5 to 5.4%. There were on the other&#13;
hand rising shares of the male labor force in manufacturing, mostly as wage-&#13;
labor in small and large establishments. 1/&#13;
6.21      To sum up, these various trends are suggestive of three basic&#13;
changes in the allocation of labor both within and among families:&#13;
(i)  A movement of women out of household manufacturing&#13;
for subsistence (own use) purposes into wage and&#13;
self-employment in tertiary sectors; 2/&#13;
(ii)  A maintenance or slow decline of some household&#13;
manufacturing activities employinig women, and which&#13;
provide a secondary source of family income;&#13;
(iii)  The emergence of manufacturing in workshops and&#13;
small and large factories as a primary source of&#13;
family income. Since this form of manufacturing&#13;
employs mostly men, it also solves the   commuting&#13;
problem referred to above.&#13;
It is of course the manufacturing activities and changes noted under (ii)&#13;
and (iii) that offer the better prospects for enhancing rural incomes; and&#13;
the primary causes of the changes are improvements in'local infrastructure&#13;
and increases in agricultural output.&#13;
6.22      The current emphasis on agricultural growth and infrastructure&#13;
improvements in the provinces is likely to increase the growth of manufac-&#13;
turing and commerce in the local towns and cities, and to accelerate the&#13;
movement of labor out of rural household manufacturing. Rising farm incomes&#13;
permit a greater division of labor between farm and non-farm work, given the&#13;
high income elasticities of demand for non-food goods, and stimulate the local&#13;
markets for both locally and externally made manufactured goods; in the case&#13;
of the demand for external goods, a rise of employment also happens in local&#13;
retail and wholesale outlets, and in repair and installation services.    Fur-&#13;
thermore, the broader the base of agricultural development, the broader the&#13;
1/   See Chapter 8 for a further discussion of the movements into wage-labor.&#13;
2/   The rising shares in tertiary activities were lamented in the IL0 (1974)&#13;
report as being a sign of too low a demand for labor in manufacturing&#13;
and the primary sectors. While tertiary activities sometimes offer&#13;
better earnings than the more marginal household manufacturing activi-&#13;
ties, it is generally believed that they are overcrowded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

effects on the labor and product markets. 1/ A study of Gibb (1974) of four&#13;
provincial towns in small farmer rice growing areas in Central Luzon showed a&#13;
rapid expansion of small-scale manufacturing and commercial activities in the&#13;
towns, in response to the farm incomes generated by the introduction of HYVs&#13;
and supporting irrigation and infrastructural services. His findings are sum-&#13;
marized in Annex Table 6.2, and are consistent with those of studies in other&#13;
countries, 2/ the more recent work of Alburo and associates (1979), and the&#13;
regional data presented in the next section.&#13;
(iii) Regional Distribution and Growth of Manufacturing Employment&#13;
6.23      The demand for labor to work in manufacturing in the agricultural&#13;
provinces is derived from three sources: (a) the demand for consumer goods,&#13;
and which rise with incomes in agriculture; (b) external demands for local&#13;
manufactures, principally garments and handicrafts; and (c) the demands for&#13;
inputs and intermediate goods by agriculture, and also by local manufac-&#13;
turing itself, and which rise with agricultural output. (Crop processing&#13;
is included in (c)). The result is a very broad spectrum of manufacturing&#13;
activities in the consumer and intermediate goods industries, as indicated&#13;
below by the employment data on manufacturing establishments:&#13;

Source: See Annex Table 6.10 for further details. The data are for&#13;
establishments of all scales.&#13;
1/   For a further discussion see World Bank (1978).&#13;
2/   One would like to see more case studies of this type, since they provide&#13;
a more accurate assessment of the response of non-farm activities to&#13;
agricultural growth and infrastructure improvements, and a clearer pic-&#13;
ture of the growth of the urban base in the provinces. For studies in&#13;
other countries see Epstein's (1973) historical study of two villages&#13;
in India, and Webb (1974) on Peru. Webb notes "New types of activities&#13;
springing up in the countryside include small businesses and trading....&#13;
a vast network of small rural markets has formed... small businesses are&#13;
probably the most important occupations in the growing urbanization of&#13;
the countryside." A study by Child and Kaneda (1975) of the tubewell&#13;
pumpset manufacturers in rural towns in the Pakistan Punjab is also worth&#13;
reading. For a discussion across countries, see also World Bank (1978).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
6.24      The level and growth of manufacturing employment in the regions,&#13;
if they are to be classified by scale of activity, have to be examined at&#13;
a more aggregative level on account of data limitations. Some data are pro-&#13;
vided in Table 6.9 for Manila and Rizal (Metro-Manila) and the Philippines&#13;
three major island groups: Luzon (excluding Metro-Manila), Visayas and&#13;
Mindanao. Since the economic conditions vary considerably between the regions&#13;
within each group, 1/ the data are still too aggregative for comparative&#13;
purposes. Luzon for instance has three of the poorest and most slowly grow-&#13;
ing agricultural regions in the country (Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Bicol)&#13;
and two of the most prosperous and rapidly growing (Central Luzon and South-&#13;
ern Tagalog). The regions within Visayas and Mindanao also require separate&#13;
analysis on account of differences in their primary resource base: 2/ for-&#13;
estry (accounting for over 40% of the country s total annual production) and&#13;
coconut in Northern Mindanao; corn, coconut and forestry in South-Central&#13;
Mindanao; low levels of per capita production in all major crops in Western&#13;
Mindanao, Central Visayas and Eastern Visayas; and sugar (accounting for over&#13;
60% of the country's total annual production), rice and fisheries in Western&#13;
Visayas. But it is difficult at present to construct a consistent time series&#13;
on manufacturing employment by scale of activity for each region. 3/ (A re-&#13;
gional breakdown for small and large industries is shown in Annex Table 6.3&#13;
for 1970, the latest year for which consistent regional data are available;&#13;
and a time series on the numbers of large and small manufacturing establish-&#13;
ments is shown in Annex Table 6.6 though even here inconsistencies remain.)&#13;
6.25      Within these various limitations imposed by the data, four features&#13;
stand out as regards changes in the size distribution of employment by region&#13;
(Table 6.9):&#13;
(a) The concentration in Manila of employment in large scale&#13;
manufacturing, amounting to 53% 4/ of total employment&#13;
in large scale in 1975;&#13;
(b) The level and growth of household employment in Manila;&#13;
1/   Annex Table 4, summarizes the economic characteristics of the 12 main&#13;
regions of the Philippines.&#13;
2/   See Annex Table 4.&#13;
3/   In 1975 the population census used a different definition of employment&#13;
to the one used in the establishment census. It is possible to make&#13;
adjustments for this (see Annex Table 6.5), but the assumptions do not&#13;
hold up well at a disaggregative level. Even the aggregative data in&#13;
Table 6.8 and Annex Table 6.5 have a number of caveats, as footnoted.&#13;
4/   Depending on the definitions adopted for small and large scale; 53%&#13;
refers to establishments with 10 or more workers. For establishments&#13;
with over 200 employees, the preliminary tabulations of the NCSO indicate&#13;
that about 52% of the employment is in Metro Manila.&#13;

&amp;    -Since the residual (household employment) is only a small percentage (20-30%)&#13;
of total employment in Manila and Rizal, the estimates here are more uncer-&#13;
tain than in the other regions: a small error in total employment is magnified&#13;
3 to 5 times in the residual; in other regions the errors are magnified by&#13;
about 1.3 to 1.5 on average.&#13;
Sources and Basis of Estimates: Total employment by regions is given in Annex&#13;
Table 6.5 (columns 1960b, 1970, 1975b), The establishment data are in Annex&#13;
Table 6.6; since these are for the years 1961, 1967, 1972 and (for establishments&#13;
of over 10 workers only) 1975, the estimates for 1960, 1970 and (for the less&#13;
than 10's) 1975, are simple trend interpolatiorBor extrapolations from the&#13;
nearest years.&#13;

(c)  The regional dispersion of employment in small-scale:&#13;
82% of employment in household manufacturing, and 78%&#13;
in small establishments, was in the provinces in 1975;&#13;
(d)  The high growth rate of establishment-based employment&#13;
(in both small and large scale) in the provinces, in&#13;
conjunction with a rapidly declining share of household&#13;
employment. 1/&#13;
6.26      (a)  The concentration of large-scale activities in Manila is&#13;
familiar, and can be discussed briefly.   It is partly a consequence of the&#13;
market for consumer goods in the region itself, and in the adjacent and&#13;
relatively prosperous agricultural regions in Southern Tagalog and Central&#13;
Luzon. Aside from the historical concentration of wealth and income in&#13;
Manila, investment there was also stimulated by the structure of industrial&#13;
incentives. The high rates of effective protection on consumer goods indus-&#13;
tries, tax reliefs on capital inputs, low rates of effective protection on&#13;
capital inputs and on agricultural and forestry products all acted to favor&#13;
investment in industry over agriculture, as discussed in Chapter 7. 2/ Simul-&#13;
taneously, the transactions costs of using the incentives, low tariffs on&#13;
imported materials, and the cost of obtaining imported inputs to industry,&#13;
both favored industrial investment near the government and near the port of&#13;
Manila. 3/&#13;
6.27      (b)  Household manufacturing employment in Manila encompasses a&#13;
very broad range of activities and earnings levels, and for this reason it&#13;
is hard to explain why it is growing so rapidly while declining elsewhere.&#13;
In Manila (as elsewhere) families primarily dependent on household manufac-&#13;
turing often have earnings comparable to or in excess of those of skilled&#13;
labor in the organized sector; 4/ others are amongst the poorest in the&#13;
1/   John Powers mentioned that this reverses a slow trend experienced in&#13;
the 1950s, when capital was moving away from agriculture at a histori-&#13;
cally high rate under the influence of protection. This is documented&#13;
in a paper by Moran (1979), to which we did not have access at the time&#13;
of writing.&#13;
2/   See especially the ILO report on this subject.&#13;
3/   Powers and Sicat (1971), p. 106.&#13;
4/   This can be inferred from the data presented in Chapter 8 (Table 8.6 and&#13;
Annex Table 8.9). In 1971, 18.3% of the families primarily dependent on&#13;
entrepreneurial activities in manufacturing were in the top quintile, and&#13;
another 18.3% in the next-to-the top. The number of families in these&#13;
groups (72,000) significantly exceeded the number of manufacturing estab-&#13;
lishments in that year. Since these data are for the country as a whole&#13;
they do not show the point explicitly for Manila, though it is highly&#13;
unlikely that Manila would have none of the better-off in these types of&#13;
activities; in fact several such families were met during the course of&#13;
field trips in the present study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

country. For some families - though a rapidly declining number 1/ - it is&#13;
a subsistence activity. For others it provides a secondary source of employ-&#13;
ment and earnings, undertaken by women and (perhaps more so than in the&#13;
provinces) has been encouraged by the putting out system, in the garments&#13;
industries in particular. 2/&#13;
6.28      Any explanation of the growth of household employment in Manila&#13;
must therefore recognize the diversity of activities involved. The possibil-&#13;
ity of measurement errors cannot of course be discarded; yet the evidence is&#13;
consistent with both cross-section and time series data on the size and growth&#13;
of the 'urban informal sector' in other countries, and one might best draw&#13;
on the models of this sector to find the elements of an explanation. 3/ The&#13;
growth of labor supply due to in-migration and the 'natural    population growth&#13;
of the city 4/ is obviously one element, combined with the low demand for&#13;
labor from the corporate sector. Another is the growth of the urban product&#13;
markets including the markets generated by the 'informal' sector activities&#13;
themselves. 5/ The fastest growth of household manufacturing in Manila also&#13;
occurred during 1970-75 (Table 6.8), a period of inflation, declining real&#13;
wages and a declining share for labor in value added; as will be discussed&#13;
in Chapter 8, it thus became more remunerative for many workers to move into&#13;
or remain in self-employment. Even before the inflation, however, the distri-&#13;
bution of earnings from self-employment and from wage-employment in skilled&#13;
occupations in the 'formal' sector overlapped, and is suggestive of a greater&#13;
competition in the labor markets for the two kinds of employment than is com-&#13;
monly supposed. Finally, as in Japan in the earlier part of this century,&#13;
there are economic and political advantages to large trading and industrial&#13;
firms in the "putting-out" of certain types of work. 6/&#13;
1/   Compare the figures on production of articles for 'own use' and 'for&#13;
sale' in Annex Table 6.1.&#13;
2/   The 1975 Population Census gives 103,000 women in Manila and Rizal as&#13;
being in the weaving apparel industry, of which less than half can be&#13;
accounted for by employment in establishments.&#13;
3/   Mazumdar (1976).&#13;
4/   Preston (1979) has pointed out an often overlooked point that the growth&#13;
of large urban areas stems in a greater measure from their 'natural'&#13;
population growth rate than from in-migration, though this is not to&#13;
suggest that the latter is unimportant.&#13;

6.29      (c)  With respect to the geographical dispersion of small-scale, it&#13;
is sometimes suggested that the geography of the Philippine islands enforces&#13;
a dispersed mattern of manufacturing and commerce. This is possibly true in&#13;
the mountain provinces, but the separation of provinces by sea in fact has&#13;
comparatively little influence, except perhaps in the three main islands of&#13;
Visayas, since 75% of the population live on the two large islands of Luzon&#13;
and Mindanao, where small scale manufacturing is also dispersed. It will be&#13;
argued below that (as in other developing countries) dispersion is a conse-&#13;
quence of the still large share of the labor force in agriculture and living&#13;
in rural areas, and which in practice leads to dispersed product markets and&#13;
to a fragmentation of production into small scale units. The rural popula-&#13;
tions in regions outside Metro-Manila range from 70% of total population in&#13;
Central Luzon, to 90% in Ilocos. Household manufacturing is mainly in the&#13;
rural areas as discussed earlier, while manufacturing in small establishments&#13;
is found mostly in local urban centers on account of better access to infra-&#13;
structure and markets. For some products it is possible for large scale&#13;
manufacturers to reach the provincial markets through the trading networks,&#13;
as happens for instance with modern durables; but the transport, storage and&#13;
marketing costs for others (furniture, construction materials, job-order-&#13;
metalwork and bakery products, for instance) are prohibitive until infra-&#13;
structure and transport services are sufficiently developed. Low wages and&#13;
the demands for cheaper if often lower quality products in the provinces also&#13;
presumably favor local small manufacturers. Although such relative cost and&#13;
marketing advantages for small manufacturers decline with the growth of per&#13;
capita rural incomes, and with infrastructure improvements, this appears to&#13;
affect a limited number of sectors, as shown earlier (Tables 6.3 and 6.5). In&#13;
others, it leads to the provincial manufacturers reaching out to the regional&#13;
and national markets, 1/ and to an overall expansion of establishment-based&#13;
manufacturing activity. 2/&#13;
6.30      (d)  The rapid changes from household to establishment based manu-&#13;
facturing in the provinces is a consequence of the developments discussed&#13;
earlier (paragraphs 6.19 and 6.20), namely the growth of the markets generated&#13;
by agriculture and the rural population for manufactured goods, improvements&#13;
in infrastructure and transport services in the provinces, and associated with&#13;
this a greater division of labor between farm and non-farm activities. As&#13;
others have found in the studies cited above, Chapter 7 will show that the&#13;
highest growth rates of establishment based manufacturing, both large and&#13;
small scale, are occurring in the high growth agricultural provinces.&#13;

Some Firm Level Data&#13;
6.31      To supplement the analysis of the census and establishment data,&#13;
and also to follow up on some of the issues raised in Part I, 80 firms were&#13;
interviewed to ascertain (a) if a significant proportion of employment gen-&#13;
erated in the higher scale ranges is due to expansion of once small firms&#13;
through the size structure, (b) what proportion of small firms, on the other&#13;
hand, fail or do not expand, (c) the sources and uses of finance at various&#13;
stages of their lifetimes, and (d) the nature and location of their product&#13;
markets. Other insights into the workings of small firms were also obtained&#13;
in the interviews and, though more difficult to quantify, greatly influenced&#13;
our interpretations of the census and establishment data, and of course the&#13;
analysis in Part I. However, below we shall concentrate on presenting some&#13;
information that emerged regarding (a), (b), (c) and (d). 1/&#13;
6.32      The sample covered all size ranges; half of the firms were selected&#13;
at random from the various size groups in the NCSO listings of large estab-&#13;
lishments of over 20 workers, and the remainder were contacted during field&#13;
trips. No attempt was made to use a questionnaire, which many interviewees&#13;
find offensive and off-putting. Our practice was to talk to the owners in&#13;
an open and informal manner, raise quetions related to our interests (and&#13;
which were often of mutual interest) and write up a brief report following&#13;
each interview, recording the main points made and whatever information the&#13;
owner had been prepared to release. The results are tabulated in Annex tables&#13;
6.11 to 6.15.&#13;
(a) Enterprise Expansion through the Size Structure&#13;
6.33      It seems that a significant proportion of labor absorption in the&#13;
larger scale categories discussed above is due to the expansion of a small&#13;
1/   The actual number that were identified for interview in this way was&#13;
selected from a much larger number first identified at random, and which&#13;
had to be pared down on account of the costs and difficulties of inter-&#13;
viewing enterprises in some regions. This naturally imparted an -urban&#13;
bias in our sample. Mrs. Fajardo was responsible for organizing and&#13;
reporting on the interviews. The material is set out at length in her&#13;
report: Fajardo (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
proportion of small firms through the size structure. 1/ Of the 80 firms&#13;
interviewed, 72 presented reasonably reliable records on their origins and&#13;
growth. Of these 72, only two were contracting; slightly less than half&#13;
were maintaining sales and employment at more or less constant levels, or&#13;
expanding slowly, while half were expanding at varying rates through the size&#13;
structure. The data on employment are provided in Annex Table 6.14, and are&#13;
summarized below in Table 6.10. Full time series data could not be obtained&#13;
in every case; it was of course easier to obtain current employment than&#13;
employment in intermediate years (though quite a large number of owners could&#13;
recall roughly how many were employed at startup, if only because most began&#13;
with less than half-a-dozen employees). The main pattern that emerges is that&#13;
the majority of firms either start small and remain small, or, if they expand&#13;
sales and employment, they do so continuously or in steps. For the sample&#13;
as a whole the number of employees averaged about 8 in their first year of&#13;
operation, rising to 24 in 1976 and 43 by 1978. 2/ These averages exclude&#13;
the largest firm in the sample, which had grown rapidly and continually from&#13;
a dozen employees when it began in 1963 to over 2,000 in 1978. 3/ They also&#13;
include firms not expanding or expanding slowly and thus understate the rate&#13;
1/   Exceptions in the establishment data tabulated above are the new branches&#13;
of large corporations; since the census data do not indicate whether an&#13;
establishment is a branch or a whole firm, it was not possible to deter-&#13;
mine precisely how much labor absorption was accounted for by branch&#13;
expansion of large firms, and how much by the growth of smaller firms.&#13;
A recent survey made by the UP Law Center of the top 1,000 corporations&#13;
in the Philippines found that 461 were in manufacturing, of which 212&#13;
were partly or wholly foreign owned. A subsample of 117 of the 212&#13;
accounted for 140,000 employees, or 22% of the factory sector labor&#13;
force in the mid seventies. Scaling up, about 40% of manufacturing&#13;
employment (in the factory sector) may be in the branch establishments&#13;
of corporations partly or wholly foreign owned. This leaves 60% of&#13;
employed in wholly Philippine-owned large corporations; but it is not&#13;
possible at present to divide any increases of employment in them between&#13;
(a) expansion of existing corporations themselves, and (b) the emergence&#13;
of new large corporations from the middle size ranges. As the interview&#13;
data suggest below, however, (b) could be sizeable; several of the firms&#13;
interviewed were expanding rapidly through the size structure.&#13;
2/   Note that reliable time series data were generally more difficult to&#13;
obtain (and so were not recorded) for the more quickly growing firms,&#13;
so these series probably underestimate the growth in the samples.&#13;

of growth of firms that do expand, which is often extremely fast once they&#13;
have gained a footing in the market; e.g., for the 12 expanding firms on&#13;
which recent time series data were obtained, employment increased by 53%&#13;
the period 1976-78 (all these firms were in the size range 10 to 99 employees&#13;
in 1976). 1/ Since the sample is small, it would be hazardous to place too&#13;
much emphasis on the precise values of the figures estimated; but it is suf-&#13;
ficient to reveal the importance of the growth of small and medium firms&#13;
through the size structure as a source of industrial labor absorption.&#13;
6.34      During the interviews it became apparent why starting small and&#13;
expanding continuously or in stages was the general rule. A high investment,&#13;
either initially, or to increase output several-fold after startup, leaves&#13;
the business highly vulnerable to short-falls in supplies and markets. If&#13;
in addition the owner' collateral is fully committed to a previous loan&#13;
obtained for purposes of investment, it is difficult to obtain a working&#13;
capital loan to meet business overheads if, for instance, there are slippages&#13;
in production. 2/ We also noticed one particular critical period in the&#13;
expansion of the firm, which occurred during their transition from backyard,&#13;
part-time to factory based, full-time operations. Before the change, the&#13;
owner generally had an alternative source of income (which is lost after&#13;
the change), low overheads (which are high after the change) and running&#13;
the business may require few management and record-keeping skills (but&#13;
which are required after the change). It might be added that advisory&#13;
services can be particularly helpful during this period.&#13;
6.35      In practice the majority of businesses remain small, and it should&#13;
be re-emphasized that the above sample, by including middle and larger sized&#13;
firms, is not representative of those that do. In 1967 there were about&#13;
41,000 establishments employing less than 10 workers (Table 6.2); by 1975&#13;
the number of establishments with 10 to 99 workers had increased by about&#13;
2,000, implying that less than one in 20 could have expanded into this large&#13;
size group. Furthermore, of those that had expanded into the size range of&#13;
1/   Cases 3, 9, 10, 14, 17, 32, 45, 51, 63, 66, 70, 71.    Case 49 was&#13;
excluded since it is so large. For cases 3, 17, and 45 in 1976 the&#13;
employment estimates are interpolated between 1974 and 1978.&#13;
2/   There is therefore some sense in the ground rules adopted by some&#13;
financial institutions of limiting the loan size to a given multiple&#13;
of the current sales and asset levels of the business; the rule may&#13;
be relaxed if the enterprise owner has sufficient collateral to provide&#13;
for contingencies. While the policy is often criticized for being&#13;
conservative, the evidence is that less-conservative policies put&#13;
both business and the banks at risk. (See Chapter 2 for a further&#13;
discussion.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
10-99 workers by 1967, less than one in 15 could have expanded into yet larger&#13;
entities by 1975. 1/ These figures are over estimates since (a) they ignore&#13;
the growth due to new branch establishments of large corporations, and (b)&#13;
do not allow for the failure rates of small establishments.&#13;
6.36      To sum up, the growth of employment in non-household manufacturing&#13;
is made up of (1) the formation of small firms, (2) the expansion of once&#13;
small firms through the size structure, and (3) branch and central expansion&#13;
of large firms. The data on (1) were given earlier (Table 6.1) and appear&#13;
to have accounted for about a quarter of employment growth (in non-household&#13;
manufacturing) in recent years. While only a very small percentage of small&#13;
firms make the transition to medium or large scale production, those that do&#13;
provide a significant source of employment growth in the factory sector.&#13;
(b) Enterprise Closure Rates&#13;
6.37      The closure rates of enterprises can be estimated from two sources&#13;
of information supplied by the NCSO:&#13;
(i) the number of enterprises actually existing in&#13;
a particular year, and&#13;
(ii) the number existing in the same year and still&#13;
existing at some later point in time.&#13;
The latter can be obtained directly from data on the age profiles of indus-&#13;
trial enterprises which appear in the NCSO's listing of establishments. The&#13;
difference between (i) and (ii) gives the number having closed in the inter-&#13;
vening years. Estimates for small and medium industries are provided in&#13;
Table 6.11. In 1977 there are 15,777 manufacturing establishments in the&#13;
NCSO listings; columns (3) of the table shows how they were distributed&#13;
according to year of formation, and column (4) the cumulative total of column&#13;
(3). Thus, to take an example, there.were 4,039 establishments formed during&#13;
or before 1966 and still existing in 1977; but the actual number existing in&#13;
1966 (shown in column 5) was 9,666, so that 9,666-4,039 = 5,627, or 58.2% had&#13;
closed in the following 11 years, an average annual closure rate of 7.9% per&#13;
year (on a logarithmic basis). The same calculation is repeated for each&#13;
year in the Table. The closure rates averaged about 7% per year in the&#13;
1960s, though seem to be lower (about 4%) for the early 1970s.&#13;
1/   In 1967 there were 3,317 establishments with 10-99 workers; the increase&#13;
in the number with over 99 workers in the period was 219 (Table 6.2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
6.38      The term 'closure', as used above, is somewhat misleading since&#13;
enterprises may not close down yet disappear from the establishaent listings&#13;
because of a change in location or in the nature of the business; counting&#13;
errors in the listings also cannot be totally avoided. Further, it does&#13;
not imply that they have failed financially since the owners may have sold&#13;
the business, retired, or moved into another form of employment. (Changing&#13;
the product line, or even the member of the family who owns the business,&#13;
is also a common way of requalifying the business.for tax holidays.) These&#13;
kinds of changes are reportedly commonplace among small enterprises, par-&#13;
ticularly among the smallest enterprises in large urban areas in which the&#13;
competition between wage and self-employment is greater. 1/ An attempt was&#13;
made to allow for these points by contacting the owners of a sample of 170&#13;
enterprises recorded in the NCSO's 1972 listing of establishments. In 100&#13;
cases, the enumerators simply verified if the enterprise was still operating&#13;
or not. 2/ In the other 70 cases (all in Metro Manila), additional infor-&#13;
mation was obtained on whether (i) the firm was operating in the same place&#13;
or had changed location; (ii) it had been merged, sold, or taken over by a&#13;
relative; or, after checking secondary sources, 3/ (iii) it had closed down.&#13;
Since the sample was based on the establishment listings, which do not cover&#13;
establishments with less than five workers, there is still no information&#13;
on the closure rates (which are probably quite high) of the smallest enter-&#13;
prises. Nevertheless, some patterns do emerge quite clearly, as shown in&#13;
Table 6.12.&#13;
6.39      The results conform with the common perception of closure rates&#13;
being higher in small than in larger enterprises. The closure rates are&#13;
also significantly higher in Manila, and probably reflect the greater&#13;
competition both among small manufacturers themselves and between large and&#13;

be negative according to the figures shown. In recent years, the closure rates are small differences between&#13;

Source:  H. Fajardo "Study on Small and Medium Industries in the Philippines"&#13;
(Mimeo), April 1979, Vol. II, Tables 1.6 and 1.7. The interviews&#13;
were between June and December 1978.&#13;
small manufacturers found in that region. (Note that the greater turnover&#13;
rates reconcile quite well with the experience of the financial institu-&#13;
tions, which find lending to small enterprises more risky in Manila than&#13;
in the provinces.) The above data also square quite well with those just&#13;
estimated from the NCSO data. The weighted average percentage of firms&#13;
disappearing in the 6-year period in Metro Manila would be about 19%, accord-&#13;
ing to the above data (and assuming one firm in five with over 20 workers),&#13;
giving a weighted average disappearance rate of ln(100/80)/6, about 3.5% per&#13;
year. 1/&#13;
6.40      The questionnaire was not sufficiently detailed to determine the&#13;
causes of closure or other changes in the business, a task that must now&#13;
await further study. Why businesses fail financially, as opposed to merely&#13;
changing their product line or location in some ways, is of particular&#13;
interest to those involved with the small enterprise programs. One commonly&#13;
discussed factor is undoubtedly the great variation in natural and acquired&#13;
entrepreneurial abilities among the owners; it is apparently one explanation&#13;
for an equally large variation found in the technical efficiencies of other-&#13;
wise comparable busineses. How far the extension and training programs are&#13;
able to improve the acquired abilities is also a task meriting further study.&#13;
1/   The closure rates as calculated from NCSO data were 4.9%, 3.1% and&#13;
3.9% for 1970,'71 and'72 respectively.   See Table 6.10.&#13;

6.41      Since the above study of closures was undertaken, a more compre-&#13;
hensive study of the extent and causes of closure due to bankruptcy among&#13;
small firms has been completed by Mr. Itao of the University of the Philippines&#13;
Institute for Small Scale Industries, 1/ based on interviews with the owmers&#13;
or former owners of 260 small firms identified from the 1975 establishment&#13;
listings of the NCSO. The principal findings were:&#13;
-    about 3.6% of small firms closed each year due to&#13;
bankruptcy, though the closure rate varied greatly&#13;
between years (this estimate compares quite well with&#13;
the estimates provided above) ;&#13;
-    the life-spans of firms going bankrupt were relatively&#13;
short (about three years on average);&#13;
-    the closure rates due to bankruptcy were not associated&#13;
with the educational or social background of the owner, 2/&#13;
nor with the level of development of the region; and&#13;
-    the closure rates were strongly associated with the&#13;
management practices of the business.&#13;
Annex Table 6.16 summarizes some data on the last two points. It is inter-&#13;
esting that the tendency to keep books and records, to separate business&#13;
and family accounts, and to use the services of professional accountants,&#13;
were all noticeably lower in the firms that went bankrupt.&#13;
(c) Sources and Uses of Finance&#13;
6.42      Given the emphasis in the government s program on supplying credit&#13;
to facilitate the expansion of small enterprises, there is some interest in&#13;
the sources of enterprise finance during startup and subsequent operations.&#13;
(Fifty-six of the seventy-two enterprises interviewed were started before&#13;
1974, the first year of the government s program.)   The enterprises   answers&#13;
to our questions on this subject are summarized in-Annex Table 6.12.&#13;
1/   See Itao (1980).&#13;
2/   Their educational backgrounds, on the other hand, were generally quite&#13;
of high standard (see Annex Table 6.16), the majority having been to&#13;
high school or college.&#13;

6.43      All but three had begun with very small initial investments; 1/&#13;
e.g., less than P 5,000 (in 1978 prices) in 10% of the cases on which infor-&#13;
mation was obtained, and P 5,000-50,000 in half of the cases. Table 6.13&#13;

This pattern of small beginnings applied to the seven large enterprises in&#13;
the sample with assets of over P 4 million (the government's definition of&#13;
large), including the nation's largest jeepney manufacturer with over 500&#13;
employees, and a large electrical appliance manufacturer and subcontractor&#13;
with assets of P 31 million and over 2,000 employees.&#13;
6.44      The majority bega'n with their own savings, sometimes supplemented&#13;
by small inheritances or by revenues from another business; only five (8%&#13;
of the total sample) mentioned that they had borrowed from financial institu-&#13;
tions when starting up, two had obtained small credits from suppliers, and&#13;
one had rented all the facilities and equipment. No instances were found&#13;
in which credit has been obtained or sought from moneylenders and other&#13;
"informal" sources. 2/ When some owners were asked if they would have&#13;

loan from a financial institution; it was one of the two businesses in&#13;
the sample in trouble, having poor market outlets and very low capacity&#13;
utilization (case 44).&#13;

tutional credit by cottage industries in the Ilocos Region.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- ill -&#13;
preferred to have started larger, finance permitting, it became apparent&#13;
that they saw advantages in starting small in order to first establish&#13;
their markets and contacts with suppliers.&#13;
6.45      Once the enterprises had become established, however, there was&#13;
a significant rise in their use of institutional credit. The rise is of&#13;
course partly due to the financial institutions own preference for deal-&#13;
ing with enterprises having track records; but it was also noticeable that&#13;
several of the owners interviewed had actively sought to develop their&#13;
credit standings with the institutions almost from the outset of their&#13;
business. All reinvested a portion of their profits, either for working&#13;
or investment capital purposes, and in 20% of the cases the businesses&#13;
were financially self-sufficient. But most businesses used a mixture of&#13;
re-invested profits, commercial bank loans, loans or equity finance from DFCs,&#13;
supplier and buyer credits, and loans from friends and relatives. Again,&#13;
there was no instance of borrowings from informal sources of credit, unless&#13;
friends and relatives are counted as such, though several attempts were made&#13;
during the interviews to determine their extent. 1/ Details are provided in&#13;
Annex Table 6.12, and summarized in Table 6.14. Note that the institutional&#13;
credit is used as often for working capital as for investment purposes.&#13;
6.46      The increasing use of institutional credit was not associated&#13;
with either excessive capacity in equipment and buildings - the workplaces&#13;
were overcrowded and congested in most cases - or a decline in the enter-&#13;
prises desire to find low cost equipment best suited to their needs. Some&#13;
evidence on these points is presented in Annex Table 6.15. The owners re-&#13;
sponses to questions on capacity utilization were naturally less precise and&#13;
more difficult to verify than those on equipment costs, but tended to show&#13;
utilization rates of 75% or more in four out of five cases. The responses on&#13;
equipment costs were more revealing, and we noted a widespread tendency to&#13;
purchase second hand or renovated equipment wherever possible (the tendency&#13;
was particularly marked in the metals and machinery sectors, where it was not&#13;
1/   One reason perhaps why we found little use of informal credit was that&#13;
our cample contained a high proportion of people with good family&#13;
incomes, higher education and professional experience, and who were&#13;
able to pass the creditworthiness checks of the financial institutions.&#13;
(We did not know in advance of the interviews anything about the owners&#13;
backgrounds, and it is possible the propensity of an enterprise to expand&#13;
is correlated with the educational and professional background of the&#13;
owner; our sample is not large enough, nor does it have sufficient in-&#13;
formation, to test for this, however). Mrs. Fajardo (1979) also found&#13;
that 103 out of 148 IGLF accounts were for businesses run by people with&#13;
college educations.&#13;

(d) Product Markets&#13;
6.47      Two sources of data were used to determine the nature of the&#13;
products and product markets of small enterprises. One was the file records&#13;
of the technical assistance (MASICAP and SBAC) and financial institutions,&#13;
which routinely comment on the markets of the enterprises financed or assisted.&#13;
For household goods, this source does not give any indication of the income&#13;
groups most likely to purchase an enterprise's products; but this could be&#13;
deduced not inaccurately from descriptions of the products and of the products'&#13;
qualities provided in the reports. The second source was our own interviews&#13;
of 72 enterprises.   The locations of the markets according to industrial&#13;
1/   Cortes and Escandon also find secondhand equipment used extensively&#13;
by small enterprises in Colombia, and for this reason undertook a special&#13;
investigation on the subject. "Use of Secondhand Equipment in Colombia"&#13;

interview data, the last four the data from both sources; the full inter-&#13;
view data are in Annex Table 6.13.&#13;
6.48       The main characteristic of the markets is their diversity with&#13;
respect to sector, location and income group, and it is not possible to&#13;
place them in a few categories. All the high growth enterprises inter-&#13;
viewed were in high growth markets, but the markets were spread across&#13;
several sectors and specializations - a range of food processing, canning,&#13;
preserving and baking activities; metals, machinery, and transport equip-&#13;
ment; furniture of all types and qualities; garments and fabrics for all&#13;
income groups and for exports; and ornaments and handicrafts. Production&#13;
for local markets is commonplace in all sectors, though a surprisingly&#13;
large number were found to be producing for national and export markets&#13;
(Table 6.16). Given the diversity of products and market locations, it&#13;
is not surprising to find no tendency for small and medium industries to&#13;
cater for any particular income group or industrial sector. A summary&#13;
of market structure of enterprises in the two samples is as follows (the&#13;
numbers indicate the percentage of enterprises in the samples):&#13;

Summary and Assessment&#13;
6.49      The above analysis first sought to show the changing distribution&#13;
of manufacturing employment by scale, type and region of manufacturing&#13;
activity. It began with the size-distribution data for the whole country,&#13;
then disaggregated it by sector and finally by region, distinguishing&#13;
between local urban and rural areas. Some firm level data were then presented.&#13;
The following points of a purely factual nature stand out:&#13;
(i) the rapid emergence, overall, of establishment-&#13;
based manufacturing--particularly in the small&#13;
and middle sized groups;&#13;
(ii) the gradual decline of household manufacturing,&#13;
which still, however, employs over half of the&#13;
industrial labor force;&#13;
(iii) the yet more rapid emergence of establishment-&#13;
based manufacturing in the provinces, mostly in&#13;
the small-scale group;&#13;
(iv) the concentration and growth of establishment-&#13;
based manufacturing in the provincial towns and&#13;
cities; and&#13;
(v) the responsiveness of all scales of manufacturing&#13;
activity to market growth.&#13;
6.50      The heterogeneity of manufacturing activities, however, and the&#13;
complexity of the changes occurring in the size distributions in different&#13;
sectors, preclude easy generalizations. It is possible to find sectors in&#13;
which household manufacturing is declining rapidly (as in food processing),&#13;
remains a significant and stable source of employment (garments and handi-&#13;
crafts, fostered under the "putting out" system) or is increasing rapidly&#13;
(backyard workshops in the engineering sectors; also, piggeries, probably).&#13;
Similar remarks apply to small and large scale establishment-based manu-&#13;
facturing, which we found fell into non-competing groups for the most part.&#13;
6.51      One point of detail was the comparatively low failure rate of small&#13;
firms (about 3-4% per year), which supports the findings in Part I, and used&#13;
in Chapter 5, that it is screening and supervision procedures rather than the&#13;
intrinsic riskiness of small firms that is the main source of the risk faced&#13;
by the institutions that finance them. Another detail is that most firms&#13;
start out with very small amounts of finance, and do not have significant&#13;
demands for institutional finance until they are somewhat larger (though&#13;
still in the small-scale range). That is, access to finance for fixed or&#13;
working capital seems not to be a "barrier to entry," though it may well&#13;
place more of a restriction on expansion or the maintenance of output when&#13;
the firms are larger.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
6.52      But perhaps the impression that emerges most strongly from the&#13;
evidence is the one that several other studies, and in particular that of&#13;
the ILO in 1974, have pointed to regarding the overwhelming influence of&#13;
agriculture on the level and growth of the rural product markets. These are&#13;
the markets most catered for by small industries. Agriculture still accounts&#13;
for 50-55% of the primary occupations of the labor force, and over the past&#13;
20 years provided roughly half of total labor absorption. In 1970, 68% of&#13;
the.Philippine population were rural, and a further 18% lived in a country-&#13;
wide network of 488 towns and small provincial cities whose functions appear&#13;
to be closely linked to local agriculture and serving the demands of local&#13;
communities. Hence the growth of agriculture itself if still capable of&#13;
generating substantial markets for non-food goods and services in the prov-&#13;
inces, and stimulating the development of local urban centers. So far,&#13;
small industries have been highly responsive to these markets and provide&#13;
a significant and growing source of income and employment in the provinces.&#13;

7. SMALL INDUSTRIES AND LEADING SECTOR POLICIES&#13;
Introduction&#13;
7.1          Under the heading 'leading sector policies' the following are&#13;
considered: industrial tariffs and incentives, and policies towards&#13;
agriculture. Other policies that often come under this heading, of course,&#13;
but they are not considered below.&#13;
7.2          It is conceivable that leading sector policies could be so&#13;
inefficient, from a strictly economic point of view, as to make small&#13;
enterprise programs economically undesirable. An extreme example might be&#13;
where small industries are heavily concentrated in inefficient sectors that&#13;
exist only because they are protected by high tariffs, so that a large&#13;
proportion would fail financially following a reduction of the tariffs.&#13;
This would not preclude them starting up again in other sectors, but any&#13;
assistance previously provided would have been channelled to the wrong&#13;
sectors, from an economic point of view. Perhaps a more common example is&#13;
where the policies simply depress the product markets to such an extent&#13;
that small scale activities cannot flourish. In this case there would be&#13;
no significant demand for the services to be provided by the small enter-&#13;
prise programs.&#13;
7.3          Fortunately, neither example accurately depicts the situation&#13;
facing small enterprises in the Philippines. But they help to illustrate&#13;
the two questions considered in this chapter: how is the economic efficiency&#13;
of small industries, and hence that of small enterprise programs, affected&#13;
by leading sector policies? and what would be the effects of a transition&#13;
to what many economists would agree are more efficient policies? The second&#13;
question is of particular relevance in the Philippines today since the&#13;
structure of tariffs and incentives to industry is under revision. Industry&#13;
will be considered first and agriculture (more briefly) second; a short&#13;
summing up is provided in the last paragraph of each section (paras 7.10&#13;
and 7.19)&#13;
Industrial Policies&#13;
7.4          The policies have been examined at length in a series of studies,&#13;
most recently by Bautista and Powers (1980) and the research group they&#13;
directed,l/ and can be summarized briefly. In the 1950s industrialization&#13;
1/ Other studies that have been influential and which provide valuable&#13;
documentation are Powers and Sicat (1971), Baldwin (1975), collected&#13;
papers of Sicat (1972), ILO (1974), World Badnk (1976)&#13;
Valdenpenas (1970), and Hicks and McNicoll (1971),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
proceeded under the protection provided by exchange controls and tariffs, with&#13;
both leading to higher effective rates of protection for manufactured consumer&#13;
goods than for capital goods. Since the early 1960s, a roughly similar&#13;
structure of protection was maintained under tariffs alone, and if anything&#13;
favored the manufactured consumer goods industries even more under subsequent&#13;
revisions of the tariff code. The following are the estimates of the effective&#13;
rates of protection (in %) provided by Powers and Sicat (1971) for 1965, and&#13;
by Tan (1980) for 1974:&#13;
1965        1974&#13;
Manufactured Consumer Goods               86           247&#13;
Intermediate Goods                        65           23&#13;
Machinery                                 34            18&#13;
Exports                                  -19            16&#13;
Tan's estimates allow for the tax incentives that were introduced under two&#13;
Acts designed to promote backward linkages in industry and industrial exports&#13;
(the Investment Incentives Act of 1967 and the Export Incentives Act of 1970).&#13;
Both Acts included a range of tax concessions on capital costs. They had a&#13;
comparatively minor effect on industrial investment and output however; e.g.&#13;
in 1972, which was one of the years in which they were most used by industry,&#13;
the total tax concessions amounted to 2% of industrial investment. 1/&#13;
7.5       The effects of these policies are familiar from the various studies&#13;
cited:&#13;
(i) Fast industrial growth in the 1950s, at over 12%&#13;
per year at the height of the import substitution&#13;
process; followed by a long period of slow growth&#13;
once saturation set in, at 4-6% per year in the&#13;
1960s, and 5-7% per year in the 1970s. (Annex&#13;
table 8.6 provides some figures).&#13;
(ii) A labor saving bias in industrial investment, since&#13;
it was the more capital intensive sectors that&#13;
received the greatest protection; 2/ the Export&#13;
and Investment Incentives Acts worked in the same&#13;
direction;&#13;
(iii)  A huge shift of investment away from agriculture;&#13;
(iv) Negligible development of the capital goods industries;&#13;
(v) Slower economic growth overall on account of the&#13;
misallocation of investment (a) between industrial&#13;
sectors, and (b) between agriculture and industry;&#13;
1/   World Bank (1976).   The same report shows that during 1970-72 about 80%&#13;
of all tax reliefs under the two Acts were on capital costs.&#13;
2/   The Bautista-Powers studies referred to found a weak Spearman Rank&#13;
Correlation Coefficient between the capital intensity and the effective&#13;
rate of protection for 51 industrial sectors (R=0.183, significant&#13;
at the 99% level.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
(vi)  A slower growth of economic output in the provinces&#13;
on account of (iii);&#13;
(vii)  A heavy concentration of investment in Manila&#13;
on account of (vi) and also of the transactions&#13;
costs to firms of dealing with controls, tariffs&#13;
and incentives if not located in Manila; and&#13;
(viii)  Disproportionately high levels of labor absorption&#13;
in the tertiary sectors. 1/&#13;
Some figures on the overall growth rates and labor absorption by sector&#13;
are provided in Annex Table 7.1.&#13;
7.6       To see the effects of the above policies on small industries,&#13;
first consider their incidence on small industries. As regards the tax&#13;
incentives under the Investment and Export Incentives Acts, the transactions&#13;
costs and complications involved in availing of them would have been too&#13;
great for all but a few large firms, and so did not directly effect small&#13;
firms. Even the indirect effects (e.g. via markets) were small, however, as&#13;
noted above. The tariff structure on the other hand had widespread effects&#13;
on practically all aspects of large and small scale production. Table 7.1&#13;
shows the incidence of the tariffs on large and small scale activites.&#13;

/1   Small Establishments have less than 10 workers, large 10 or more.&#13;
/2   When an estimate is on the dividing line it is put in the upper&#13;
category. E.g. an EPR of 0 is included in the 0 to 25% range.&#13;
/3   For the sample of industries studied.&#13;
/4   Data not available for all sectors listed in Annex Table 7.2.&#13;
Source: Annex Table 7.2. The estimates of EPRs are those of Tan (1980).&#13;
1/   See ILO (1974) report.&#13;

The "underprotected" sectors would include those with ERPs of less than about&#13;
25%; about 80% of employment in small and 45% in large industries is found in&#13;
this group. Indeed 68% of those employed in small industries are in sectors&#13;
with negative ERPs.&#13;
7.7       A more detailed breakdown of the above table according to different&#13;
scales of activity could not be obtained from the information available to us.&#13;
It is possible that household manufacturing also has a large proportion of&#13;
workers in the underprotected sectors. For example, the making of garments&#13;
and embroidered products is a common activity of Philippine households,&#13;
command a large market, and yet both have EPRs in the range minus 50 to minus&#13;
25% (Table 7.2). It is not possible to say much about firms in the range of,&#13;
say, 20 to 200 workers, except to note that they too must often try to develop&#13;
in the sectors discriminated against by the tariff system - e.g. in the&#13;
capital goods industries and machine shops, which are commonly found in the&#13;
Philippines (see e.g. the interviews reported in Chapter 6).&#13;
7.8        It must be concluded that the tariff system has not helped small&#13;
industries, and it is all the more remarkable that, in the light of this,&#13;
their emergence and growth has been as rapid as was reported in Chapter 6. A&#13;
shift to a more uniform and less protective tariff structure would act to&#13;
encourage growth in several sectors in which small enterprises now provide a&#13;
significant level of employment. Table 7.2 shows a breakdown of employment&#13;
by type and scale of industry and the level of ERP 1/ (it is the same data&#13;
as was used to construct Table 7.1). Examples are rice and corn milling,&#13;
some dairy products and preserves, footwear, embroidered products, custom&#13;
tailoring and garment making, 2/ furniture, printing,of books leather products,3/&#13;
pottery and earthenware; mechanical, electrical and agricultural machinery;&#13;
motor vehicle bodies; and others. All have low or negative ERPs, and in&#13;
several instances are high growth sectors (see Tables 6.3 and 6.5). Equally,&#13;
there would be a number of sectors in which profits and labor demand in small&#13;
enterprises could be expected to decline with lower and more uniform tariffs.&#13;
But in contrast to the preceeding, most could hardly be described as the bread&#13;
and butter of Philippine manufacturing - e.g. motorcycles, toys, musical&#13;
instruments, jewelry, chocolates, wines; and paper products, and tanning and&#13;
leather finishing.&#13;
1/   We are grateful to John Powers for spotting a number of errors in an&#13;
earlier version of the following table - as well as for his constructive&#13;
comments on several other aspects of the study.&#13;
2/   This is not included in Tan's data, but it is a large source of employment&#13;
in the country, which probably has the same ERP as ready made clothes&#13;
(i.e. minus 26%). See also ILO (1974) for a study of the effects of&#13;
protection in the textiles and garment industries.&#13;
3/   See Bautista (1979) on the effects of protection in the leather and&#13;
leather products industries. The results are almost exactly parallel to&#13;
those of the ILO's study of textiles and garments (Ibid): low protection&#13;
for an efficient sector that provides a large amount of employment, but&#13;
which has to use a costly and inferior raw material input from highly&#13;
protected domestic producers.&#13;

7.9       Something can also be said about the efficiency of the sectors in&#13;
which small and large industries are located. Bautista and Tecson (1980)&#13;
estimated the Domestic Resource Costs (DRCs) of 92 industrial sectors. Their&#13;
estimates are reproduced in Annex Table 7.2, and are summarized in Table 7.3&#13;
below.&#13;

listed in Annex Table 7.2.&#13;
According to the DRC criterion a sector is less efficient the more the&#13;
value of the DRC exceeds, and more efficient the more it lies below, the&#13;
shadow exchange rate. 1/ The exchange rate in 1974 was about 6.8 pesos&#13;
per dollar, but various estimates cited by Bautista and Tecson put the&#13;
shadow exchange rate at about 9 pesos per dollar. Approximately 80% of&#13;
employment in small establishments lies in the efficient sectors on the&#13;
basis of this estimate, and 65% of employment in large'establishments.&#13;
It seems reasonable to infer therefore that the services and finance&#13;
provided by the small industries programs will generally be associated&#13;
with activities located in economically efficient sectors, even under&#13;
the present industrial tariffs policies, and it is almost tautological&#13;
to argue that they would also be in the efficient sectors following a&#13;
transition to more efficient policies.&#13;
1/   Let E be the shadow exchange rate, P the world price; D the domestic&#13;
cost component (in shadow prices) and F the foreign exchange cost&#13;
component of a manufactured good. Then the cost-benefit criterion is F x&#13;
E + D &lt; PE for an efficient sector. Or, D/(P-F) &lt; E, where the term on&#13;
the left hand side is defined to be the Domestic Resource Cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

7.10      The above evidence shows that small industries in the Philippinss&#13;
have functioned in the presence of price incentives that, in general, have&#13;
worked against them, and that (like some large scale industries) they would&#13;
stand to gain from the more uniform and efficient tariff structure that is now&#13;
being contemplated in the Philippines. They should also stand to gain in two&#13;
other respects. Firstly, from a more rapid growth of the domestic product&#13;
markets in general, on account of the efficiency of the new policies; and&#13;
secondly from a yet more rapid growth of the regional product markets in&#13;
particular, since the tariff structure has historically penalized the develop-&#13;
ment of agriculture.&#13;
Agricultural Policies&#13;
7.11      It was concluded in Chapter 6 that the influence of agriculture&#13;
on the product markets, improvements in infrastructure and transport services,&#13;
and the advantages of local small scale production for certain classes of&#13;
products, help to explain the growth of small scale, establishment-based&#13;
manufacturing in the Philippines in the past 10-20 years. This conclusion is&#13;
also consistent with the evidence that the growth of employment in workshops&#13;
and factories (both small and large scale) is also highest in regions where&#13;
agricultural incomes are growing more rapidly and broadly, as for instance in&#13;
the small farmer rice and corn growing districts in Central Luzon, Southern&#13;
Tagalog (Southern Luzon) and Mindanao. The available regional data are not&#13;
sufficiently disaggregated to document this point as thoroughly as one would&#13;
like, though it is supported by studies of particular districts, in the Philip-&#13;
pines and other countries noted in Chapter 6. The changes are significant&#13;
enough to be apparent in the aggregate regional data shown in Table 7.4.&#13;

The figures are regional averages; the growth rates in the high growth dis-&#13;
tricts in Luzon and Mindanao are higher than those shown in the above table. 1/&#13;
The urban growth rates in each of the regions are also broadly distributed,&#13;
but tend to be higher in the high growth districts.&#13;
7.12      This association between agriculture and urban industrial development&#13;
(both small and large scale) in the provinces seems so important as to merit&#13;
further examination of even the rather aggregative evidence at our disposal.&#13;
The evidence confirms the association between the efficiency of small enter-&#13;
prise programs and the efficiency of agricultural policy; but it of course&#13;
goes beyond that, as the ILO (1974) report made clear using the evidence that&#13;
was available at that time. Consider the three regions Luzon, Mindanao in&#13;
turn.&#13;
7.13      In Luzon, two regions (Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog) accounted&#13;
for over 30% of total rice production (rice is the country's principal crop);&#13;
Southern Tagalog also had quite high shares in coconut, corn and timber&#13;
production (Annex Table 6.4). High yielding rice varieties were being used in&#13;
Central Luzon as early as 1966; but the main increases in rice production&#13;
occurred in the 1970s, during a revival of a long-standing but defunct land&#13;
reform program for rice and corn farmers, and an intensification of extension,&#13;
credit, infrastructure and irrigation programs. Since time-series data on&#13;
inputs and outputs by region are not readily available, it is necessary to&#13;
consider national aggregates and keep in mind that provinces in Central Luzon&#13;
and Southern Tagalog were among the principal beneficiaries of the programs.&#13;
By 1977, HYVs were being planted on 86% of irrigated and 68% of rainfed rice&#13;
areas in the country; but perhaps as important were the lasting improvements&#13;
on rice farming practices and the supporting supply and marketing services. 2/&#13;
The changes in rice production are apparent in Annex Table 6.9 and Figure&#13;
1, which show the general increase in yields and outputs that occurred in&#13;
the 1970s. 3/ (The decline in 1972 was due to a rice crop virus, "tungro",&#13;
and in 1973 to severe flooding in Luzon.) 4/&#13;

7.14      The associated trends in establishment-based manufacturing employment&#13;
were provided in Table 7.4 above. For Luzon as a whole (excluding Manila and&#13;
Rizal) the employment trends since 1960 averaged 8.3% per year for small&#13;
establishmnents and 9.6% per year for large establishments. These figures&#13;
probably understate the growth in Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog since&#13;
they are aggregates and include three of the slowest developing regions in&#13;
the country. 1/ Other features to note are the decline in the share of&#13;
household employment from 80% to 57% over the 15 year period) 2/ as the&#13;
analysis in Chapter 6 would predict; the net migration into the regions (Annex&#13;
Table 6.4), 3/ notwithstanding their closeness to Manila; and the high average&#13;
growth rates of the principal cities (Annex Table 6.8). 4/&#13;
7.15      The next highest growth regions in the country are in Mindanao,&#13;
where the main products of the primary sector are timber, corn and coconut, in&#13;
which local production amounted to 68% ana 65% respectively of the country's&#13;
total production in 1975 (Annex Table 6.4). While the overall growth rates in&#13;
these sectors have been comparable to those for rice productinn, the origins&#13;
of the growth have been quite different. The response to improved practices&#13;
and HYVs for corn farming was low compared to rice (Castillo, 1977) and&#13;
70-80% of the growth in output in the 1970s has been due to an area expan-&#13;
sion, 5/ as can be seen from Figure 2; this of course implies a slower growth&#13;
of earnings on fixed area small farms than would occur under conditions of&#13;
rising yields.&#13;
1/   Ilocos, Bicol and Cagayan Valley.   Ilocos and Bicol show below averate&#13;
rates of establishment formation, Cagayan slightly above average;&#13;
Cagayan has a relatively small number of establishments however. Annex&#13;
Table 6.7.&#13;
2/   See Table 6.4.&#13;
3/   The in-migration rates can be inferred from the population growth rates&#13;
in these regions, which were above the 'natural' population growth&#13;
rate. (Annex Table 6.4 provides data on population growth, but not&#13;
on migration.) An analysis of internal migration patterns in the&#13;
country up to 1973 is provided in Mrs. Castillo's study (1977), Volume&#13;
III, in which she notes that "the in-migration regions are .... Northern&#13;
and Southern Mindanao ...... and Central and Southern Luzon" (p.865).&#13;
Quite detailed tabulations are presented in this volume.&#13;
4/   The variance in the growth rates should be noted.    Growth rates range&#13;
from 2.2% per year in San Jose (Central Luzon, Population 53 thousand),&#13;
to 8 to 9% in Olongapo and Palagan (populations 147 and 12 thousand&#13;
respectively). The average in Central Luzon was 4.9%, and in Southern&#13;
Tagalog 3.4% (c.f. 4.8% for Metro-Manila).&#13;
5/   The difference between the two plots in Figure 2 provides a measure&#13;
of the increase in output due to the increase in area cultivated.&#13;

Coconut, in contrast to most other crops, is generally a secondary activity&#13;
for farm families and, while overall output increased at about 3.5% per year&#13;
(Annex Table 6.9), this has been accompanied by a systematic decline in yields&#13;
over a 15 year period. Timber production which expanded at over 5% per year&#13;
in the 1960s, was first held constant and then reduced in the 1970s for&#13;
reasons of forestry conservation, reforestation and ecology. Overall per&#13;
capita output from the primary sector in the region has nevertheless risen&#13;
over a long period. 1/ Associated with this were a decline in the share&#13;
of household manufacturing employment (from 72% to 52% over the period&#13;
1960-75); growth rates of 9.7% and 5.7% respectively of manufacturing employ-&#13;
ment in large and small establishments; and an average growth rate of 4.2% of&#13;
Mindanao's 14 principal cities (Annex Table 6.8) 2/&#13;
7.16      Regions experiencing the slowest (and also the most narrowly-based)&#13;
growth in the primary sectors include Western Visayas (the main sugar growing&#13;
region in the country), Eastern Visayas, Bicol and Ilocos. Each have the&#13;
following in common: net out-migration, a slow rate of growth of the prin-&#13;
cipal cities (2.3% in Western Visayas, 2.1% in Eastern Visayas, 1.8% in Bicol&#13;
and 2.7% in Ilocos), and a slower rate of growth of employment in establish-&#13;
ment-based manufacturing. Even in these regions, however, the share of&#13;
employment in household manufacturing is declining, though it remains sig-&#13;
nificantly higher than elsewhere (e.g. 68% in Visayas, as compared to around&#13;
55% on average in other provinces.)&#13;

(Table 7.5), which suggests that the potential for rural-led industrial growth&#13;
in the provinces is still considerable:-&#13;

The potential obviously varies greatly between provinces, and was examined at&#13;
length during the preparation of the current Development Plan. 1/    It is for&#13;
instance much more limited in Ilocos (where fisheries, handicrafts and tourism&#13;
have been stressed) and Central Visayas (where the development of the larger&#13;
urban centers has been stressed); also, in some regions the urban-industrial&#13;
base is itself now large enough to provide a lead.&#13;
7.18      This is clearly not the place to review plans, however, and it is&#13;
sufficient to note that it is intended to maintain the emphasis that has been&#13;
placed on a broad based development of agriculture since the early 1970s.&#13;
What can be said from the limited perspective of the present study is that, to&#13;
the extent that these policies are successful in achieving a more broadly&#13;
based growth of incomes in the rural areas and towns, they should stimulate&#13;
the product markets of local manufacturing establishments, both large and&#13;
small scale. The demands for the services and finance provided by the small&#13;
enterprise programs are likely to be greatest in these regions.&#13;
7.19      To sum up, the evidence just presented underlines the improtance of&#13;
agriculture as the leading element in urban-industrial development in the&#13;
provincss. This conclusion is not new. But the strength of the linkages&#13;
between agriculture and local industry and commerce appear to be even stronger&#13;
than might have been thought earlier; in the high growth agricultural districts,&#13;
the emergence of small and large manufacturing establishments in the local&#13;
urban centers has been very rapid in recent years; and the rapid growth of&#13;
establishment based manufacturing in the provinces has apparently reversed the&#13;
trends experienced in the early phases of industrialization, when agriculture&#13;
was given a very low priority. 2/&#13;

8. SMALL INDUSTRIES AND THE EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM&#13;
Introduction&#13;
8.1       Perhaps no assumptions have bedeviled discussions on small industry&#13;
policy more than those that arise from differing perceptions of the employment&#13;
problem in developing countries. It is odd that, since substantively different&#13;
implications may follow from one perception rather than another, a harder look&#13;
has not been taken at the evidence since Turnham's (1970) review. 1/ Peter&#13;
Gregory (1980) remarks that "The popular and professional literature is&#13;
replete with references to an alleged 'failure' of economic development to&#13;
provide a sufficient number of new employments to absorb rapidly growing lhbor&#13;
forces. Expressions of fear that a low absorptive capaciry would lead to a&#13;
deterioration in the quality of employment or to an increase in open and&#13;
disguised unemployment have now been converted into assertions that employment&#13;
conditions have been worsening generally.... What is notable about these&#13;
assertions is that they are undocumented, that is, they lack an empirical&#13;
foundation. Few would argue .... that employment conditions are precarious&#13;
for many .     However, to go beyond such an observation and to ascertain that&#13;
employment conditions have actually been deteriorating would seem to require&#13;
more than a simple statement that it is so .      2/ With respect to small&#13;
industry programs, the most common assumption is that the rates of both&#13;
unemployment and underemployment (however defined) are increasing to alarming&#13;
levels. 3/&#13;
8.2       This assumption affects what is considered a desirable investment&#13;
in various ways, and has certainly been the primary reason why small enter-&#13;
prise programs have been introduced in many countries.   Employment creation at&#13;
a low cost per job is becoming an objective in its own right over and above&#13;
considerations of economic efficiency - understandably given this perception&#13;
of unemployment. In the Philippines as in several other developing countries&#13;
projects are preferred if they expand employment in existing firms or create&#13;
new firms, and if they have fixed asset/labor ratios below a certain thres-&#13;
hold. Projects not adding to employment directly, though adding to output,&#13;
are frequently rejected. But what if unemployment rates are declining to low&#13;
levels, accompanied by declines in real wages? In fact, this is a more&#13;
accurate statement of what has been happening in the Philippines in the past&#13;
20 years, at least in industrial occupations. Employment creation per se as a&#13;
1/   A review is now underway in the "Wage-Employment Trends and Structures"&#13;
project in the IBRD (RPO 671-84).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

separate objective is then less relevant than that of raising incomes, as has&#13;
been argued for some time. 1/ In this case it is not difficult to show that&#13;
the rate of return to capital remains a robust criterion for selecting desir-&#13;
able investment, that is, it is not inconsistent with the objective of finding&#13;
projects that offer improved employment opportunities. One is then left with&#13;
the purely practical problems, when appraising investments, of allowing for&#13;
possible departures between wages and the opportunity costs of labor, and&#13;
between actual prices and efficiency prices.&#13;
8.3       Those familiar with what has been happening to employment and&#13;
earnings levels in developing countries might find such difficulties puzzling.&#13;
On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that the nature of the employment&#13;
problem is often not well understood and this in itself leads to well-&#13;
intentioned policies and programs being more limited in scope than necessary,&#13;
that is, to desirable investments being rejected. The best way out of the&#13;
difficulty it seems is to look again at the evidence, and see what has been&#13;
happening to employment and earnings levels. This is the purpose of the&#13;
present chapter. It begins by looking at the levels and trends in wages and&#13;
employment over the past 25 years, drawing on a study by Lal (1979). Changes&#13;
in the earnings of the self-employed, who comprise 60% of the labor force,&#13;
are considered next. It is followed by a look at the changing occupational&#13;
structure of the labor force, and at how this too has affected earnings&#13;
levels. The analysis also serves to introduce in a simple and intuitive&#13;
manner the relevance of the economist's criterion for selecting desirable&#13;
investments - allowing for one's concerns about employment conditions. A&#13;
formal discussion of the criterion is reserved for Chapter 9.&#13;
Employment, Unemployment and Under-employment: Levels and Trends&#13;
8.4       Table 8.1 shows employment and labor absorption by economic sector.&#13;
At the time the Small and Medium Industries program was introduced in 1974 the&#13;
labor force had expanded at over 3% per year over the previous 20 years, from&#13;
under 9 million in the mid'l950s to over 14 million by the mid' 1970s; by&#13;
1979 it was over 17 million, with 600 thousand people entering the labor&#13;
market each year. Between 1956 and 1974 agriculture provided about 51% of&#13;
labor absorption, commerce 12.2%, government services 13.6%, and factory-based&#13;
manufacturing activities, although accounting for about one fifth of gross&#13;
fixed capital formation in the private sector, only 4.9%. It was often&#13;
noted that low productivity tertiary activities absorbed more labor than&#13;
than industry, as for instance with 5.8% of the new entrants being employed&#13;
in domestic services (mostly as domestics) over the period. 2/&#13;
8.5       Further series on employment over the period 1960-76 are shown&#13;
in Table 8.2. The first column shows the NCSO's estimates of participation&#13;
rates, which declined slightly over the period, from 54-57% in the early&#13;
1/   See e.g. Stewart (1977), Chapter 2.&#13;
2/   The ILO (1974) report provides an analysis of trends in labor absorption&#13;
and labor productivities by sector.&#13;

60s to 50-52% in the mid   70s; a closer look at the data by age group&#13;
shows that the declines were most marked among teenagers, 1/ presumably&#13;
on account of the rising shares attending school or college.&#13;
8.6       Unemployment rates for household heads and for the urban and&#13;
rural labor forces are also shown, from which the following points stand&#13;
out: (i) the systematic declines in unemployment rates from 6-7% in the&#13;
early 60s to 3-5% by the mid '70s; (ii) the relatively low unemployment&#13;
rates in rural areas in all periods (on average they have been about 60%&#13;
lower than those in urban areas); and (iii) the relatively low levels of&#13;
unemployment recorded among household heads (about 1.2 to 1.5% in the mid&#13;
70s). As in other countries, unemployment is more concentrated among&#13;
the younger of the labor force, though again there is some evidence of a&#13;
decline for all age groups over time (Table 8.3):-&#13;

3/   Ernie Pernia rightly pointed out to us that the definitions of unem-&#13;
ployment in the population censuses of the NCSO have changed: the labor&#13;
force surveys have been more consistent, however.&#13;

belief that it was not available, or because of temporary illness, bad weather&#13;
or other valid reasons." This definition has been followed consistently in&#13;
the labor force surveys since 1956.&#13;
8.8       The NCSO's surveys also provide estimates of what are defined&#13;
at the "visibly under-employed", who are people with part-time jobs (i.e.;&#13;
working less than 40 hours a week) and wanting additional work. 1/ The series&#13;
are also shown in Table 8.2 (co. 8) for the period 1956-76; . again the&#13;
noticeable feature is that the rates declined, from about 8-9% in the mid&#13;
1960s to 5-6% in the mid 1970s. Working hours were also long and increased&#13;
(col. 6); in 1965, 85% of the labor force claimed to be working more than 40&#13;
hours per week and in 1976, 90%. In column (9) of the table a composite&#13;
measure of unemployment is provided, 2/ based on the full-time equivalent of&#13;
the visibly under-employed plus the unemployed, and indicates that about 7.3%&#13;
of man-days of work were lost due to un or under employment in 1976, as&#13;
compared to 13.1% in 1965.&#13;
8.9       Hence the available data show that the economy has been able to&#13;
absorb its labor force during the past 20 years, notwithstanding the capi-&#13;
tal intensive development path discussed in Chapter 7. A rather different&#13;
impression of the effects of this development path emerges, however, if one&#13;
looks at trends in wages and earnings.&#13;
Changes in Real Wages Over Time 3/&#13;
8.10      Published data on wages are not comprehensive, and are available&#13;
in some sources only for Metro-Manila, and in others for particular indus-&#13;
tries or time periods. Selected series are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, and&#13;
in Annex Tables 8.1 to 8.4. 4/ Figure 1 plots movements in real wages for&#13;
1/   There are of course several other definitions of under-employment based&#13;
on disparities between wages and marginal productivities of the employed.&#13;
The relevant data are not available to use these definitions here; even&#13;
if they were, however, they would not affect the following analysis for&#13;
the same reasons as are laid out by Stewart (1977, Chapter 2) in her book&#13;
on Technology and Underdevelopment.&#13;
2/ Taken from Lal (1979).&#13;
3/ This section draws on Lal's (1979) report and is kept brief. 'The&#13;
following includes a discussion of agriculture, agricultural wages and&#13;
earnings in self employpment (which are not discussed in his report).&#13;
4/   The data have the advantage of coming from several independent sources,&#13;
which serve to provide some cross-checks. The series draw on the Central&#13;
Bank's surveys of large establishments in Metro-Manila; Beacon, for agri-&#13;
cultural wages; the BCS (later NCSO) surveys of households; the NCSO&#13;
surveys of establishments; and unpublished Wage and Salary Surveys in&#13;
the Philippine office of Compensation and Position. The Wage Commission&#13;
also make independent analyses of the wage series from these sources&#13;
in connection with minimum wage legislation, and presumably check the&#13;
series further.&#13;

skilled and unskilled labor in large establishments in Manila since 1950;&#13;
Figure 2, real wages in agriculture and in selected industrial occupations&#13;
(again in Manila) over the same period; and figure 3 real weekly earnings of&#13;
wages and salaried workers for several sectors (but over a much shorter period&#13;
on account of data limitations). These figures show that, with certain&#13;
exceptions to be noted below, real wages have been more or less constant&#13;
in some periods, and have declined rapidly in others; the period of most&#13;
rapid decline was 1969-74, when real wages fell in some sectors and occupa-&#13;
tions by over 40%.&#13;
8.11      What caused these changes?   An allowance must of course be made&#13;
for measurement errors. It was pointed out to us 1/ that the introduction&#13;
of wage supplements and bonuses in the 1970s may have given an exaggerated&#13;
picture of the downward trends shown in some series. While the various&#13;
series treat these factors differently, 2/ however, and sometimes ignore&#13;
them, they give results that differ more in magnitude than in direction,&#13;
as can be seen from Figures 1, 2 and 3. Furthermore, detailed analysis&#13;
of the series show a remarkable association between changes in the real&#13;
wage levels and contemporaneous economic events. 3/ In particular, the&#13;
changes in any period can be traced to one or more of three factors:&#13;
-  product prices, which have at various times&#13;
acted to draw investment towards the more capital&#13;
intensive manufacturing sectors of the economy,&#13;
and away from the more labor intensive sectors,&#13;
both agricultural and non-agricultural;&#13;
-  investment incentives which raised the capital&#13;
intensity of industrial investment yet further; and&#13;
-  until recently, comparatively low investment in&#13;
infrastructure and support for agriculture.&#13;
Superimposed on this were the effects of the continual rise in labor supply.&#13;
In each instance, however, a rise in labor supply or a fall in labor demand&#13;
resulted in a downward pressure on wages rather than increased unemployment,&#13;
and also (as will be seen later) in some shifts between wage and self-employment.&#13;
8.12      A formal analysis of wage movements is outside the scope of this&#13;
study, but a short digression to summarize the main economic events and&#13;
their associations with wage movements might be useful. These events can&#13;
be grouped very roughly into five periods.&#13;
1/   By John Powers.&#13;
2/   The NCSO's series count weekly earnings and the Central Bank's monthly&#13;
earnings, so both ignore cash bonuses such as the "13th month bonus."&#13;
The NCSO's establishment data, however, are based as annual earnings,&#13;
presumably include cash bonuses, and also show a precipitous decline&#13;
in labor's share in value added in the 1970s.&#13;
3/   See Lal's report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

8.13      (1)  1950-58.   This was a period of high prices of manufactured&#13;
consumer goods under the protection provided by exchange controls. 1/ There&#13;
was in consequence a large shift of investment away from the more labor&#13;
intensive agricultural activities towards large scale manufacturing, and&#13;
which acted to keep wages and productivity in agriculture at low levels.&#13;
Manufacturing output grew at over 12% per year in this period, 2/ when import&#13;
substitution was proceeding rapidly, and probably accounts for the rise in&#13;
real wages, to historically high levels, in large manufacturing establishments&#13;
in the Manila area (Figure 1). The concentration of investment in Manila,&#13;
and the smallness of the large establishments' share in manufacturing employ-&#13;
ment (about 16%) and total employment (less than 3%) in the '50s necessarily&#13;
confined any favorable impact on real wages to a very small share of the labor&#13;
force.&#13;
8.14      (2)  1958-63.   By the late  50s the possibilities for further&#13;
import substitution were becoming increasingly limited. Industrial growth&#13;
rates declined quickly to one half and then (by the early '60s) to one third&#13;
of the levels in the early '50s, averaging about 4.9% in the period 1958-64&#13;
(Annex Table 8.6); in addition, the capital intensity in large-scale manufactur-&#13;
ing rose steadily, in part because of a range of exemptions on import duties&#13;
on machinery and equipment to industry. 3/ Both lowered the demand for indus-&#13;
trial labor and, while this may have resulted in a slight reduction in the&#13;
growth rate of industrial employment (Annex Table 8.6), its main consequence&#13;
was a sharp fall in real wages (Figures 1 and 2).&#13;
8.15      (3)  1963-69.   Beginning in 1960, the exchange controls and a&#13;
multiple exchange rate system were gradually phased out, the process being&#13;
completed by 1963. Protection was maintained under tariffs. This might&#13;
have reduced the relative price of manufactured goods slightly since, though&#13;
the tariff system was instituted in the 1950s, prices up to 1963 were above&#13;
c.i.f. prices plus tariffs. 4/ The period 1963-69 was one of relative price&#13;
stability, while the industrial growth rate also bottomed out at 4-5% per&#13;
year. Real wages in large industries remained more or less constant in&#13;
this period (Figures 1 and 2) while real wages in agriculture fell slightly&#13;
(Figure 2).&#13;
8.16      (4)  1969-74.   In this period several events seem to have had&#13;
an influence on the observed decline of real wages all round - in modern&#13;
establishments in Manila (Figures 1 and 2), in agriculture (Figure 2) and in&#13;
1/  See Powers and Sicat (1971) and Baldwin (1975).                          1&#13;
2/ See Annex Table 8.6, and also Chapter 7. In the early 1950s, the growth&#13;
rate was around 15% p.a.&#13;
3/ See Powers and Sicat, op. cit., for a further discussion.&#13;
4/ "So long as exchange controls were in effect the tariff system served&#13;
(merely) .... to permit the Government to share in the rising scarcity&#13;
premia on imported goods." Powers and Sicat, op. cit. p. 93.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

non-industrial sectors (Figure 3). 1/   To promote backward linkages on&#13;
industry, the Investment Incentives Act offered tax reliefs and subsidies&#13;
for the capital goods manufacturing sectors, as discussed in Chapter 6,&#13;
again shifting resources away from the more labor intensive (non tradeables)&#13;
sectors. But the main factors reducing real wages, at least in industry,&#13;
appear to have been the management of aggregate demand and trade deficits in&#13;
1969, and in 1972-74 a rise in the relative prices of locally manufactured&#13;
goods induced by rising world prices and the maintenance of a fixed exchange&#13;
rate. 2/ In each instance it was argued that the effect was to raise the&#13;
relative prices of - and cause a permanent shift of resources towards - the&#13;
more capital intensive traded goods sectors. 3/ Finally, although agriculture&#13;
was by then receiving higher priority, the programs had yet to have a major&#13;
effect, and were in addition set back by crop diseases and floods in 1972 and&#13;
1973. 4/&#13;
8.17      (5)   1974-78.  Since 1974 the declines in real wages appear to&#13;
have bottomed out in the non-agricultural sectors (Figures 1, 2 and 3),&#13;
but to have risen significantly in agriculture for the first time in over&#13;
1/   The declines also occurred in most regions of the country, according&#13;
to Annex Table 8.5. While this Table is for the period 1973-76, note&#13;
that there were also large declines in real wages between 1973 and 1974&#13;
(Figures 1, 2 and 3).&#13;
2/   Lal, op. cit., p. 114 et. seq.   It should be added that "this was a&#13;
period of great instability in the economic environment. A substantial&#13;
surplus in the trade balance .... (followed)    .... the upsurge of interna-&#13;
tional prices of primary commodities (in 1973) .... (and which was then)&#13;
.... completely negated by the sharp increase in the import bill for&#13;
crude oil..," Bautista and Powers (1979) op. cit. p. 22.&#13;
3/   In 1972-74 the effect of holding the exchange rate constant was an&#13;
unambigious rise in the relative prices of traded goods. In 1969 the&#13;
events were more complicated.   According to Lal (p. 111 et. seq.)&#13;
excessive Government spending caused a rise in domestic expenditures on&#13;
non-traded and traded goods; a rise in the relative prices of non-traded&#13;
goods; and a balance of payments deficit. Rather than restore the&#13;
trade balance and relative prices through a period of deflation and&#13;
mild devaluation, the Government devalued by!over 40%, actually resulting&#13;
in a larger share of investable resources being allocated to the (more&#13;
capital intensive) traded goods sectors than previously. Inflation&#13;
followed, real wages declined as did labors share in value added in&#13;
manufacturing (which was 23% in 1969, and 15% in 1974, according to&#13;
the establishment surveys). The redistribution of income that took&#13;
place presumably further reinforced the shifts in production through a&#13;
redistribution of consumption patterns.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
20 years (Figure 2): 1/ there was also an increase in agricultural wages&#13;
relative to those for industrial labor in Manila (Figure 4). 2/ In the 70s,&#13;
and particularly since 1974, output in foodgrains has also risen at histori-&#13;
cally high rates, following the introduction of the agricultural development&#13;
programs mentioned in chapter 7. 3/ Given the importance of these crops&#13;
in the country, it is possible that this has had a significant effect on&#13;
raising the demand for - and thus the wages of - both farm and non-farm labor&#13;
in the provinces. Finally, although the structure of protection did not&#13;
change significantly in this period (though changes towards a less-protective&#13;
policy are now being considered), large scale manufacturing was relatively a&#13;
larger souce of employment than previously, 4/ and its continued expansion&#13;
was probably having a greater influence on the labor markets.&#13;
8.18      The above explanation of wage movements obviously rests on the&#13;
assumption of a competitive labor market, in which any differences between&#13;
labor demand and supply are eliminated by changes in the wage levels; this&#13;
assumption applies both to individual sectors (wage relativities) and to&#13;
the sectors in aggregate (wage levels). These assumptions have been inves-&#13;
tigated elsewhere 5/ and hold up to scrutiny. There is, for instance, no&#13;
evidence of institutional, technological or geographic constraints on the labor&#13;
market which seriously affect occupational mobility. Minimum wage legislation&#13;
has probably only a slight effect on the labor market (and then only on a&#13;
small number of large firms); minimum wages have generally followed rather&#13;
than led actual wages in the past 30 years, 6/ and small firms registered&#13;
with NACIDA are exempted from paying minimum wages under the Labor Laws.&#13;
Earnings in Self Employment&#13;
8.19      The general declines in real wages over the period since the&#13;
mid 1950s do not provide a wholly satisfactory picture of what happened to&#13;
the earnings of the labor force since the majority (approximately 60% in&#13;
1976) are self-employed or family workers. 7/ Table 8.4 provides some statis-&#13;
tics. Approximately 85% of the labor force in agriculture were self-employed&#13;
1/   There were some slight rises in 1959, 1961, 1969, 1970 and 1973.&#13;
2/   John Powers pointed out again that the comparisons may be distorted&#13;
depending on how wage supplements were treated in the series.&#13;
3/   See Figures 1 and 2 of that Chapter and the accompanying discussion.&#13;
4/   In 1976 it accounted for over 35% of employment in manufacturing.&#13;
5/   See Lal's review, and also Castillo (1976).&#13;
6/   See Annex Table 8.7 and also the ILO (1974) report for a further&#13;
discussion.&#13;
7/   For brevity, family workers will also be referred to as being self-&#13;
employed.&#13;

employed workers will be considered below: Owners of very small manufacturing&#13;
establishments with less than 10 workers, small farmers, and people in house-&#13;

more stable than real wages, and might even have increased in the '70s when&#13;
the latter were falling. Table 8.5 compares some estimates of owners' earnigs&#13;
per day with wages in different occupations:&#13;

One can see that the earnings rates in self employment have risen sig-&#13;
nificantly above those even for the higher paid forms of industrial labor&#13;
(such as industrial foremen)-in Manila. This profit incentive helps to&#13;
explain the rapid emergence of small establishments throughout the country&#13;
since the mid '1960s, (described in chapter 6) and why some people have&#13;
moved out of wage employment to set up their own firms (see interview data&#13;
in Chapter 6).&#13;
8.21      Turning to small farmers, the only time series data available are&#13;
those of the Family Income and Expenditure Surveys (FIES) of the NCSO, which&#13;
since 1956 have been conducted about every five years. These data, which&#13;
are reproduced in their raw state in Annex Table 8.9 and 8.10 have quite&#13;
wide (if quantitatively unknown) confidence intervals because of changes in&#13;
sampling and questioning procedures between surveys; measurement errors&#13;
were also large and family incomes were under-reported more in some years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
than in others. 1/ But from the perspective of the present study, one&#13;
relatively non-controversial conclusion can be drawn. This is that the&#13;
capital intensive, development path of the economy did not act to increase&#13;
unemployment rates among the self employed in agriculture, but as with&#13;
wage labor, to depress earnings.   The majority of families in the lowest&#13;
quintiles in 1971 were self-employed in agriculture: 61.7% in the lowest&#13;
quintile, 50.2% in the second lowest and 42.1% in the middle quintile (Table&#13;
8.6).  Up to 1970 it is difficult to tell whether incomes rose or fell for&#13;
these groups, but in either event, they remained at very low levels. 2/&#13;
in the 1970s the NCSOs surveys (FIES) suggest a marked increase in income of&#13;
about 30-50% for the lowest two quintiles (Annex Table 8.10); this could&#13;
either be a measurement error or the first positive signs of a favorable&#13;
impact on rural income of the new emphasis on agricultural development,&#13;
but is' probably a combination of the two. 3/ The increase in the rate of&#13;
1/   See Berry (1979), Mangahas and Barros (1979) and IBRD's (1980) draft&#13;
on "Poverty, Basic Needs and Employment."&#13;
2/ 'Berry (1979) and IBRD (1980). Recalling that the majority in these&#13;
groups are small farmers, roughly constant real incomes in this period&#13;
would also be consistent with roughly constant (or slight increases)&#13;
in labor productivities (Annex Table 8.6). In the 1950s value added&#13;
in agriculture kept pace with the growth of the labor force through&#13;
land expansion and in the 1960s through increases in yields. ILO&#13;
(1974, pp. 442 et. seq.).&#13;
3/   Although there is no shortage of criticism in the studies cited of&#13;
the unreliability of the FIES income data (and in particular of the&#13;
1975 surveys) the data in fact square quite well with the wage series&#13;
discussed earlier. The following list converts the 1975 income data&#13;
for each quintile into a daily earnings rate by dividing by 300 working&#13;
days per year, and then provides some examples of types of wage-earners&#13;
whose families (if they were the family head) would fall into these&#13;
groups:&#13;

(*Mangahas and Barros (1979) rightly point out that, as in previous surveys&#13;
incomes in the top quintile have been particularly susceptible to under-&#13;
reporting.) Similar cross-checks on wages and the 1970 FIES income data&#13;
are provided in Annex Table 8.15 (source note (b), third paragraph), again&#13;
with no marked anomalies between the two sources being apparent.&#13;

of output and yields in food grains support the last view; there is also some&#13;
circumstantial evidence for it (see Chapter 7) in that the emergence of&#13;
establishment-based manufacturing in the provinces, the corresponding decline&#13;
of household manufacturing, and the growth of commerce in the rural towns in&#13;
the late 60s and 70s could not have occurred without some lead from agriculture.&#13;
8.22      The effects of the economic events described above on families&#13;
primarily dependent on self-employment in household manufacturing are more&#13;
mixed, since these families are found in all income groups, low, medium&#13;
and high. 1/ To make a general point again, however, it was incomes&#13;
(rather than unemployment levels) in these activities that were most effected&#13;
by the pattern of investment in the country. A large proportion of household&#13;
manufacturing activities are rural (Annex Table 8.9) where the incomes are&#13;
dependent on the markets generated by agriculture; others are tied to low&#13;
income markets in the urban informal sector, and indeed are part of it; while&#13;
a not insignificant number later emerge as establishment-based manufacturing&#13;
units in the high growth markets.&#13;
Incomes and Occupational Mobility&#13;
8.23      Changes in the incomes of the labor force can be considered in&#13;
two parts: changes in wages and earnings within given occupations, and&#13;
which were discussed above; and changes arising from the movement of labor,&#13;
during periods of marked structural change, 2/ towards better paying occupa-&#13;
tions. The latter are discussed briefly below, and serve to highlight the&#13;
kinds of activities that should or should not be considered for finance under&#13;
the small enterprise program if it is to effect an improvement in earnings&#13;
opportunities. It is convenient to consider the movements themselves in two&#13;
parts: 3/ i.e., movements (i) of the self-employed into better paid forms of&#13;
wage employment or self-employment elsewhere; and (ii) of wage labor into&#13;
better paid forms of wage employment.&#13;
8.24      The extent of the former is indicated in Annex Table 8.11 (bottom&#13;
three rows) for the period 1965-76. Over this period the share of the labor&#13;
force in wage and salary work rose by 6.2% in absolute terms (from 40.6 to&#13;
46.8%) and in self-employment in the tertiary sectors by 1.4%. In self&#13;
1/   See Table 8.6 which shows that in 1971 there were 36 thousand families&#13;
in the top quintile primarily dependent on entrepreneurial activity&#13;
in manufacturing, and another 36 thousand in the second-top quintile.&#13;
There were, at that time, less than 60 thousand manufacturing estab-&#13;
lishments in the country, implying that at least 12 thousand families&#13;
primarily dependent on household manufacturing were in these quintiles.&#13;
2/   The movement helps to explain the paradox of incomes not necessarily&#13;
declining, and possibly increasing in recent years, in the presence of&#13;
the significant declines in real wages - though changes in the earnings&#13;
in self-employmemt must provide most of the explanation. See also Berry&#13;
(1979) for a discussion of wages and incomes up to 1970.&#13;
3/   A third part is the movement of wage-earners back into self-employment,&#13;
and which was briefly discussed above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
employment in manufacturing there was a slight decline of 1.2%, mostly&#13;
on account of people leaving household manufacturing, and in self-employment&#13;
in agriculture a decline of 6.4%. As one might expect, a comparison of&#13;
these shifts with the income distribution data shown in Table 8.6 reveals&#13;
that they were greater the greater the likelihood of an income increase:&#13;
Absolute Change in       Income Distribution of&#13;
Type of Occupation          Share of Labor Force     Occupational Group&#13;
(Table 8.6)&#13;
Wage or Salaried Work             + 6.2              Strong upwards skew&#13;
Self-Employed&#13;
-  Trading and Transport          + 1.4              Skewed upwards&#13;
- Manufacturing                   - 1.2              Fairly Flat&#13;
-  Agriculture                    - 6.4              Strong downwards skew&#13;
8.25      It is possible to Project these changes on the income distribution&#13;
data shown in Table 8.6 to estimate, holding other things constant, their&#13;
effects on incomes. Briefly, the distribution of incomes for the whole labor&#13;
force is a weighted average of the distributions for its occupational groups,&#13;
in the present case wage and salary earners and three categories of self-&#13;
employed workers (in agriculture, manufacturing and commerce); the weights&#13;
are then changed to reflect the occupational shifts, holding the component&#13;
distributions constant. 1/ The calculation is provided in Annex Table&#13;
8.11, and shows that the approximate effects of these shifts (other things&#13;
constant) would be to have raised the average income of all families in the&#13;
bottom two quintiles by about 9% over the period and the average incomes of&#13;
those families who actually moved by about 56%. 2/&#13;
8.26      A comparable calculation for the effects of occupational shifts&#13;
of wage labor is only possible for the period 1960-70 (at least until the&#13;
1975 establishment census becomes available). Annex Table 8.12 shows the&#13;
changing shares of employment for the various categories of skilled and&#13;
unskilled labor. The share of wage labor in agriculture declined by one&#13;
third, from 32 to 21%; in household manufacturing (where one in four workers&#13;
are hired) by one sixth; and remained stationary or declined very slightly&#13;
in domestic services. These are all among the lowest paid forms of wage&#13;
labor. In the higher wage occupation the shares increased: in large and&#13;
small production establishments, sales work, land transport and in the&#13;
1/   If the shares of the four occupational groups are S 1...S4, ( Si=l) and&#13;
the distribution vectors are (D ) ...(D ), then the aggregate distribution&#13;
vector is (D) = 51(D1) + S2(D2) + S3(D3) + S4(D4).    The values of S 1...S4&#13;
are then changed to get the new (D).&#13;
2/   See supplementary calculations (2) and (3) in the Table.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
hotel, restaurant, service and other trades. 1/ The same table shows wages&#13;
in the higher paying occupations to vary between two to four times above&#13;
those in lower paying ones. The effects on average wages can then be divided&#13;
into a change due to the decline in real wages, and a change due to the&#13;
increase in the shares in higher wage occupations. 2/ The calculations are&#13;
made in Annex Table 8.13, which suggests that the latter offset about 80% of&#13;
the decline in real wages in the 1960s. 3/ Had of course the labor demand&#13;
conditions been such as to raise real wage levels, the occupational shifts&#13;
(which in those circumstances could well have been greater) would have acted&#13;
to increase incomes yet further, as opposed to simply having a mitigating&#13;
effect on the adverse consequences of declining real wages.&#13;
8.27      To sum up, the economy has been able to absorb its rapidly growing&#13;
labor force, but the labor demand conditions resulting from a capital inten-&#13;
sive development path have exerted a downward pressure both on real wages and&#13;
on earnings in self-employment. But analysis of occupational structure shows&#13;
a continual movement of labor out of ill-paying to better paying forms of wage&#13;
and self-employment. This movement has been shown to have a significant&#13;
effect on both the level and the distribution of incomes, though the effect&#13;
cannot be quantified precisely over the period 1960-76.&#13;
Investment Criteria&#13;
8.28      What is suitable criterion for financing or otherwise supporting&#13;
small enterprise projects? An obvious one is to accept only those projects&#13;
with a demonstrated potential to generate income sufficient to pay labor&#13;
after all other costs have been met. That is:&#13;
Present worth of sales less material and capital costs &gt; 1&#13;
Present worth of labors   earnings              -&#13;
3/   Professional administrative and clerical workers are excluded from the&#13;
analysis since the intention is to examine income changes in the lower&#13;
quintiles.&#13;
4/   If Wiis the wage in occupation i and Si the share of the total labor&#13;
force employed in wage labor, then the change in shares S is approximately&#13;
E(&amp;i.Sj + W,A S%). This is the calculation made in Annex Table 8.12.&#13;
5/   80% = 0.7/0.9, referring to columns (4) and (5) of the table.    In the&#13;
1970s, the more rapid declines in real wages were probably not offset to&#13;
the same extent by occupational shifts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
This is of course exactly equivalent to using the rate of return on capital as&#13;
a criterion or more simply to saying that the project should be profitable:l/2/&#13;
Present worth of sales less material, capital and labor costs\&gt; 0&#13;
So at least from the viewpoint of the extensionists and the financial institu-&#13;
tions they are doing the right thing in financing only profitable projects.&#13;
8.29      From the viewpoint of the Government agencies, however, it is&#13;
natural to inquire if following a purely financial criterion - profits -&#13;
does not lead to some conflict with the economic aims of the program. Should&#13;
weight be given to certain types of projects, for instance, over and above&#13;
financial considerations? The short answer is that there are now standard&#13;
ways of adjusting the above criterion by using shadow prices and shadow wages&#13;
instead of actual prices and wages when making the calculations. These are&#13;
discussed more formally in the next chapter, but a remark on shadow wages&#13;
might be helpful.&#13;
8.30      If people are to move into wage employment in (say) a project&#13;
financed by the program, the actual wages offered should&#13;
(a) be better than wages or earnings in&#13;
alternative occupations, and&#13;
(b) include a sufficient financial incentive to&#13;
cover the transport, resettling and any other&#13;
extra personal costs anticipated by the employee.&#13;
The sum of these two terms gives the social opportunity cost of labor (or&#13;
the shadow wage rate), and equals actual wages unless there are any marked&#13;
inefficiencies in the labor market. Where inefficiencies do exist it is&#13;
necessary to estimate (a) and (b) from survey data or other sources 3/ to&#13;
1/   If S represents annual sales, and M, (WL) and K respectively represent&#13;
materials, labor and capital costs (W=wages, L=employment), then if A(r)&#13;
is the annuity rate this criterion is&#13;
S - M - (WL) - A(r) K &gt; 0&#13;
assuming for simplicity a constant time stream for each variable. If&#13;
this is set as an equality, the rate of return is derived from:&#13;
A(r) = (S - M - (WL))K&#13;
where r is the rate of return. The first criterion mentioned above is&#13;
(S - M - A(r)K)/(WL) &gt; 1.&#13;
2/   Where no incremental employment is involved, either this or the rate of&#13;
return criterion would have to be used.&#13;
3/   E.g. on the lines recommended by Little and Mirless (1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -&#13;
determine whether a project is likely to improve earnings opportunities or&#13;
not. At the present time in the Philippines wages probably do reflect (a)&#13;
and (b), at least to a good approximation, in the labor market faced by small&#13;
firms. There is little institutional influence on wages in those markets, and&#13;
the labor force is highly responsive to any new employment opportunities that&#13;
emerge, as it is hoped the foregoing analysis has shown. The economic ineffi-&#13;
ciencies appear not to lie in the labor markets, but in the policies that have&#13;
led to an unnecessarily low demand for labor.&#13;
Labor Intensity in Small Industries&#13;
8.31      The incremental capital-labor ratio was used for assessing the&#13;
desirability of small enterprise projects in the Philippines, and has also&#13;
been used in other countries. There are obvious theoretical objections to&#13;
its use for these purposes, which it is not necessary to go into. Some&#13;
practical objections reported to us by people involved with the program are&#13;
worth recording however.&#13;
8.32      To begin with, the overall labor intensity of small industry&#13;
in the Philippines, as in other countries, is greater than it is in large&#13;
industry (Table 8.7).&#13;

The data shown are for book values of fixed assets and are subject to the&#13;
usual problems of definition and measurement. Even allowing for these&#13;
uncertainties, however, it is clear that in aggregate the smaller the scale&#13;
of industrial activity the less its capital intensity.   Hence the small&#13;
enterprise program is likely to be associated with a more labor intensive&#13;
class of industrial Pnterprises; and, insofar as it facilitates a greater&#13;
level of investment in them than otherwise would occur, it is likely to&#13;
raise the average labor intensitv of industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 155 -&#13;
8.33      The idea of using the capital-labor ratio as an investment criterion&#13;
was to encourage the search for more labor-using investments. In practice it&#13;
did not prove to be very useful for this purpose, and was often in conflict&#13;
with the interests of finding good projects. First, as one would expect, what&#13;
determined the ratio for a project varied greatly with local wage levels.&#13;
There were instances when it made sense to have projects that eliminated the&#13;
more labor intensive and onerous of a firm's activities in order to raise&#13;
output and labor productivity: that is, to have projects with negative K-L&#13;
ratios. In other instances, little or no increase of employment was expected,&#13;
but again an increase of output, leading to infinite K-L ratios. Second, the&#13;
ratios varied greatly across industries, while only one average figure for&#13;
manufacturing as a whole was used as a criterion; e.g. it varies over an 80:1&#13;
range at the two digit level (Annex Table 8.16). 1/ Intrinsically labor&#13;
intensive projects (e.g. in garments) easily fell below the average and the&#13;
criterion had no influence on choice of technique, while others (e.g. ice&#13;
factories for fisheries) fell far above it, and could not meet the criterion&#13;
unless people employed indirectly (fishermen) were counted. Thus its use&#13;
simply led to fudging. Apart from such practical problems, there were problems&#13;
of interpretation. Changing K-L ratios might be an efficient and desirable&#13;
response to changing real wages or an inefficient consequence of capital&#13;
subsidies, and have to be interpreted in the context of current economic&#13;
conditions and policies. More generally, there is an optimum ratio for each&#13;
firm that varies over time with wages and capital costs. 2/ Finally, there&#13;
is the point that it is the corporate sector rather than small scale activities&#13;
that have inefficiently high K-L ratios, on account of the industrial incen-&#13;
tives and tariffs policies discussed earlier. Labor intensive methods of&#13;
production are already widespread outside the corporate-sector, frequently&#13;
burdensome and generally associated with low wages and earnings - indeed, this&#13;
is precisely the nature of the employment problem in the Philippines today.&#13;

_2/  If there is a continuous range of techniques availgble for a particular&#13;
industry, then the optimum ratio is (K/L) = a(w/r) , where a is a con-&#13;
stant, b the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, w&#13;
wages and r the cost of capital services. If b = 0 (i.e. no substitution&#13;
is possible), (K/L) = a and is independent of the relative costs of labor&#13;
or capital. But most industries have a range of alternatives, particular-&#13;
ly when one considers the extent to which second hand equipment embodying&#13;
older technologies is available (c.f. the interview results presented in&#13;
Chapter 6). In some cases cnly discrete alternatives are available,&#13;
while in others they may be increased in number by invention or adaptation.&#13;
The optimising criterion then becomes more complicated, as it does with a&#13;
multi-period optimising model with inherited capital stock. But the&#13;
point that the optimum, or "appropriate," ratio varies with wages remains.&#13;

9, APPRAISAL METHODS FOR SMALL ENTERPRISE PROGRAMS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
9.1       The appraisal methods discussed below are those that can be used&#13;
for assessing the economic desireability of small enterprise programs. They&#13;
draw on standard principles of cost benefit analysis.l/&#13;
9.2       It is obvious that cost-benefit analysis cannot be applied to each&#13;
and every small investment financed by small enterprise programs, and it&#13;
would be preposterous even to contemplate foisting formal cost-benefit&#13;
procedures on branch staff. There are a large number of such investments&#13;
(e.g., over 6000 in the first five years of the Philippines' SMI program)&#13;
and the costs would be prohibitively high even if qualified people could&#13;
be found and trained to do the job.&#13;
9.3       There are however several ways in which cost benefit analysis can&#13;
be useful to the government institutions involved with the programs, if it&#13;
is undertaken as part of their research and evaluation work. Most of the&#13;
larger institutions have departments involved in some form of research or&#13;
another to provide guidance on policy; in connection with the small enter-&#13;
prise programs, for example, ex post analysis of "problem accounts" was&#13;
instrumental in redefining appraisal and supervision procedures and reducing&#13;
risks, as noted in Chapter 2. An application of cost benefit analysis to,&#13;
say, samples of projects, requires information on how taxes, tariffs or&#13;
various quotas may be affecting prices and markets; on wages and the kinds&#13;
of labor employed; and on private and social profits. It is thus a very&#13;
good procedure for organizing information, for identifying the kinds of&#13;
activities that are profitable and finding growing markets, and for setting&#13;
ground rules for lending.&#13;
9.4       A discussion of cost-benefit analysis also serves to bring together&#13;
some of the issues discussed in the previous four chapters. It is well known&#13;
that the analysis is only requred under two conditions:&#13;
(a) where there are known distortions or failings in markets; and&#13;
(b) if there are economies of scale, external costs and benefits,&#13;
or surplus benefits not accounted for in private profit and&#13;
loss calculations.&#13;
9.5       In the following analysis it will only be necessary to discuss&#13;
capital and labor markets, the former because they are not well dealt with&#13;
in the cost-benefit literature, and the latter because there are still some&#13;
problems arising from false perceptions as to the nature of the employment&#13;
problem.&#13;
1/ E.g. Mishan (1971), Little and Mirlees (1975) and Squire and van der Tak&#13;
(1975).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Projects and Programs&#13;
9.6        Below, the term "project" refers to small investments in the firms&#13;
themselves, while the term "program" refers to the aggregate of such projects.&#13;
Since the projects are independent of each other, total net benefits are the&#13;
sum of the net benefits of the projects less the joint costs of establishing&#13;
or expanding the program. The joint costs are mostly the administrative and&#13;
overhead costs of training staff and developing procedures.     Thus if Bt&#13;
represents the net benefits of a program in period t, Ct the joint&#13;
costs at that time, Bit the expected net benefits of a particular project,&#13;
present worthed to period t, and (l-pt) the probability of a project being&#13;
successful, then:&#13;
Bt     Ct + (1pt) iBit                                (1)&#13;
In practice, the estimate of    IBit can only be made for samples of projects&#13;
and grossed up.                 i&#13;
Alternatives to Institutional Finance&#13;
9.7       We now need a method for estimating Bit.     As in other projects the&#13;
starting point is to identify the alternatives. With respect to the provi-&#13;
sion of institutional finance, the alternatives are a greater reliance on:&#13;
(a) internal sources of finance (family savings, retained&#13;
earnings); and&#13;
(b)  other external sources (trade credits and the informal&#13;
sector capital markets).&#13;
Where the inputed cost of (a) or the actual cost of (b) are greater than the&#13;
costs of institutional finance, a reduction of investment and output is&#13;
implied if the latter is' not available, except in the unlikely event of the&#13;
derived demand being inelastic. 1/ The provigion of institutional finance&#13;
then:                                    b&#13;
AJ The alternatives can be summed up in a familiar way by the supply&#13;
and derived demand curves for finance; the derived demand curves&#13;
representing the rates of return to capital of individual projects,&#13;
one supply curve (generally higher) representing non-institutional&#13;
sources and another institutional sources of finance.&#13;
supply from non-institutional sources&#13;
demand curve without extension    (Shaded area&#13;
represents the&#13;
demand curve with extension&#13;
supply from institutional sources. three sources of&#13;
benefit discussed&#13;
below).&#13;
Q&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
- makes additional investments possible that would otherwise be&#13;
unprofitable if financed out of other (higher priced) external&#13;
sources, or which would not have been worthwhile to the owner&#13;
if the inputed cost of internal sources were too high; and&#13;
- for those projects that would still be undertaken without&#13;
institutional finance, provides a cost savings to the&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
Industrial extension aims to have the further effect of:&#13;
- raising the demand curve for institutional credit by reducing&#13;
the transactions costs faced by the borrowers.&#13;
The relevant question is then whether these three sources of benefit, after&#13;
allowing for losses due to "lemons," outweigh the costs of the program. All&#13;
three are part of the consumers' surplus, and it would not be necessary to&#13;
estimate them if payments on principal and interest fully covered the costs&#13;
of the programs. But since this condition is not met in practice, and&#13;
probably cannot be met in the short-run, for reasons discussed in Chapter 5,&#13;
it is necessary to examine how they can be estimated. This can be done with-&#13;
out precise information on the demand curves.&#13;
9.7       Each project financed is used to increase the capacity and output&#13;
and/or improve the efficiency and profits of an enterprise in various ways.&#13;
Each project is thus expected to be associated with:&#13;
-  a change, AS, in the annual sales of the enterprise,&#13;
-  a change, AM, in its material and running costs, and&#13;
- a change, AL, in employment.&#13;
If the amount of investment made possible by the loan is K, and the average&#13;
wages are w, then the expected annual incremental benefits, AB, to the&#13;
enterprise are&#13;
AB =   AS - AM - wAL - A(r)K                      (2)&#13;
where A(r) is the annuity rate and r now denotes the interest rate on the&#13;
loan. The expected rate of return to the investment, denoted by y, is then&#13;
given by&#13;
A(y)  =  (AS - AM - wAL)/K                       (3)&#13;
9,8       In principle therefore it is possible to estimate the rates of return&#13;
to the programs by considering a sample of the projects financed, estimating&#13;
the various quantities in (2), 1/ and grossing up over the whole sample.&#13;
1/ This calculation is actually made by the extension workers and the financial&#13;
institutions when appraising the larger term loans. (see Chapter 4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
Fixed overheads, administrative or other costs of the program need to be&#13;
deducted from the estimate of A B, as in (l). The sales and variable cost&#13;
figures are all expected quantities, to be derived from the projections for&#13;
each project and multiplied by the probability of the project's being success-&#13;
ful. This may be greater than the probability of principal and interest being&#13;
repaid since there is no guarantee that the owiners of successful enterprises&#13;
will repay the loans. On the other hand, since their not doing so is damaging&#13;
both to the institutions and ultimately to other borrowers, it would not seem&#13;
good practice to count these cases as being successful. The quantities p'&#13;
and p" as defined in Chapter 5 are prqbably the right ones to use. 1/&#13;
9.9       The above procedure is likely to over-estimate the rates of return&#13;
to the programs unless it is accompanied by an analysis of, and an allowance&#13;
for, the costs of alternative sources of external finance (trade credits,&#13;
informal capital markets), which in some circumstances may prove to be the&#13;
more efficient alternative. If these sources are available at a cost of,&#13;
say, y, then businesses with higher rntes of return to capital than this can,&#13;
and presumably do, turn to them in the absence of institutional credit. It&#13;
is therefore only appropriate to include the whole of the returns to capital&#13;
(as estimated in (2)) in cases where y c y; in others, the quantities to&#13;
estimate are the cost savings, which are given by y minus the opportunity cost&#13;
of supplying institutional finance.&#13;
When are the Alternatives Likely to be Preferable?&#13;
9.10      The above analysis is a simplification of what is in practice a&#13;
complex pattern of demand and supply of finance for small enterprises, It&#13;
raises the basic questions: what is the expected demand for institutional&#13;
credit? And, are the projects financed expected to have satisfactory returps,&#13;
sufficient to justify the costs and the losses in developing a lending program?&#13;
As shown, an assessment of alternatives is crucial in arriving at answers to&#13;
these questions.&#13;
9.11      It does not follow, however, that if institutionAl credit is in:&#13;
demand for some purposes that-the alternatives will-~be displaceT-dr-uhneOded&#13;
for others--or even for the same purposes. In fact, the interviews reported&#13;
in Chapter 6 show more evidence of complementarities than of competition&#13;
between alternative sources of finance (e.g., the demand for trade credits&#13;
rising with fixed asset finance). The complementarities stem from variations&#13;
in the capital structure of small firms, and in the nature of the product and&#13;
supplier markets; what is a suitable financial arrangement for one firm is&#13;
often not for another. An obvious contrast is between the garments and&#13;
engineering industries. The former have low overheads and rely more on trade&#13;
credits to finance materials supplies and work in progress; even the smallest&#13;
scale activities often obtain the credits indirectly through the "putting out"&#13;
system, The engineering industries, having larger overheads, a larger share of&#13;
1/ In failed projects the whole of the investment is of course not lost,&#13;
but presumably can be salvaged for use elsewhere or by new owners,&#13;
To allow for this (l-p') and (l-p") should include recoveries from&#13;
foreclosures and exclude costs of litigation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
work in progress, and often being expected not to receive but to offer credit&#13;
in the form of delayed receipts from customers, appear to rely more on the&#13;
banking system to organize working capital finance, or, in the absence of&#13;
this, to rely exclusively on retained earnings. It is hard to generalize,&#13;
however, since engineering firms working under subcontracts may have different&#13;
financial arrangements.&#13;
9.12      We also suggested in Chapter 4 that own savings, retained earnings&#13;
and such informal sector finance as is available   were the best sources of&#13;
finance for new businesses.   The probability of a bank's financing a "lemon"&#13;
is much less for a business that has proved itself and established its markets&#13;
and sources of supply. A bank's finance is generally advantageous when a sig-&#13;
nificant increase of output and/or assets is contemplated, since informal sec-&#13;
tor loans appear to be very short-term and in small amounts. Another suggestion&#13;
in Chapters 3 and 4 was to use traders as conduits for working capital finance,&#13;
rather than always working directly with small manufacturers. Finally, most&#13;
institutions regard it as good practice (a) to require a significant injection&#13;
of a businesses' own savings or retained earnings into a project, either for&#13;
fixed or working capital; and (b) to be satisfied that, if one type of finance&#13;
is to be provided (e.g. term-finance), finance will still be available from&#13;
other sources (whether internal or external) to meet the other requirements of&#13;
the firm.&#13;
9.13      Hence a mixed solution is suggested rather than an exclusive reliance&#13;
on one source or another. The task of the small enterprise programs is to de-&#13;
velop the capacity and know-how of the financial institutions, and address&#13;
the problems posed by uncertainty, where there is a latent demand for their&#13;
particular services. The above criteria are intended to provide a check on the&#13;
efficiency of the projects, and determine when this effort is worthwhile.&#13;
9.14      Summing up, the economic returns to small enterprise programs can&#13;
be estimated from an analysis of the rates of return to capital invested in&#13;
the enterprises, allowing for the probability of unsuccessful projects and&#13;
deducting any costs of the programs not included in the project costs.&#13;
Allowances for alternative sources of finance may be necessary in some cases,&#13;
though institutional sources are often used to augment and complement rather&#13;
than compete with the alternatives.&#13;
Labor Markets and the Opportunity Cost of Labor&#13;
9.15      Given the importance of projects that offer improved earnings&#13;
opportunities for the labor force, there are at first sight grounds for&#13;
using a shadow wage (SWR) below actual wages (w) when appraising the projects,&#13;
so as to give a premium to those projects that actually do raise earnings&#13;
levels-l/Thus the social benefits of a project, as estimated in (2) above,&#13;
1/   A paper by Medalla (1980) in Bautista and Powers presents an estimate&#13;
of the SWR for unskilled labor *in the Philippines. It is a country-&#13;
wide estimate however, and does not allow for variations according&#13;
to region, occupation, skill levels and the experience, qualities and&#13;
job preferences of individuals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
would be increased by AL(w-SWR). Since this may entail the selection of some&#13;
projects that would make a financial loss, the preceding argument is sometimes&#13;
used to justify subsidized credit programs for small enterprises. Apart from&#13;
the difficulties that such subsidies cause for the raising and administering&#13;
of loanable resources, there is another objection to this argument in that,&#13;
at least with respect to small enterprises in the Philippines, shadow wages&#13;
and actual wages probably do not differ significantly. The following discus-&#13;
sion explores this point further, and aims to show why the current practice&#13;
of appraising projects based on actual wages should lead to a selection of&#13;
projects that are consistent with the aim of improving earnings opportunities.&#13;
9.16      First note that the rate of return or net benefit criterion can be&#13;
rewritten as:&#13;
AS - AM  - A(r)K      1               (4)&#13;
wAL&#13;
That is, a project is desirable if it is capable of providing for labor s&#13;
income after all other costs have been met. The rate of return is thus&#13;
a rigorous criterion for screening for projects offering earnings&#13;
opportunities at least as good as elsewhere, provided the wages reflect the&#13;
opportunity costs of labor (or the shadow wage rates). To see why the latter&#13;
condition is met in the Philippines, at least to a good approximation, it is&#13;
instructive to consider the recommended practices for estimating SWRs.&#13;
9.17      In Chapter 8, it was shown that the wage labor in manufacturing&#13;
was being drawn from several sources: (a) wage labor in agriculture, (b)&#13;
self-employed labor in agriculture, (c) wage and self-employed labor in&#13;
low-income, mostly rural and non-agricultural activities, (d) the unemployed,&#13;
and (e) new entrants to the labor force who would otherwise be in one or the&#13;
other of (a), (b), (c) or (d). Even if a worker happens to be drawn directly&#13;
from another lesser paid job in manufacturing, it will generally create a&#13;
vacancy to be filled by workers from one of the above. This pattern of move-&#13;
ment appears to be quite general in developing countries, and for this reason&#13;
the starting point for estimating an SWR is usually taken to be a weighted&#13;
average of the daily earnings in (a), (b), (c) and (d). 1/ There are, in&#13;
addition, further adjustments recommended in the literature to allow for&#13;
the following. 2/&#13;
(i) the transport and resettling costs of moving&#13;
to a new phase of work;&#13;
1/   See Little-Mirrlees, op. cit., p.257-262.   The calculation appears to&#13;
be extra-ordinarily intricate to do properly, particularly if (as with&#13;
SSE programs) it is necessary to allow for regional disparities in wages&#13;
and marginal productivities of labor.&#13;

(ii) the costs of labor being temporarily unemployed&#13;
or working in part-time or lowly-paid work before&#13;
finding the better-paid job; 1/&#13;

wages for consumption when the money, if invested,&#13;
might yield higher consumption benefits in .the&#13;
future; 21 and&#13;
(iv) the added incentive required to make the new job&#13;
sufficiently attractive relative to the old one; 3/&#13;
e.g. the higher wage rates that are needed in urban&#13;
areas to provide for the higher costs of dwellings,&#13;
food and transport.&#13;
The first two adjustments act to raise the SWR over the weighted average&#13;
of earnings in previous work. The third is generally thought to reduce it,&#13;
though it is very likely small in the Philippines on account of the oppor-&#13;
tunities for workers to save and invest. 4/ The fourth term is probably&#13;
quite large for workers moving to Manila, where wages for given occupations&#13;
are significantly higher than elsewhere, but not so large for those moving&#13;
to workshop and factory production in the provinces; it helps to explain why&#13;
the opportunity costs of labor (like wages) are likely to vary greatly among&#13;
regions.&#13;
1/   Mazumdar (1976).&#13;
2/   This is the term (l-l/S)(w-MP) in the references cited.     Here (w-MP)&#13;
is the net increase in earnings (MP=marginal product of labor). S&#13;
is the ratio of the value of uncommitted government income to the&#13;
value of consumption. It is generally taken to be greater than unity&#13;
on the grounds that workers do not save and invest sufficiently but&#13;
consume excessively. The whole term is a measure of the net loss&#13;
assumed to occur on account of the income being consumed by workers&#13;
instead of being invested (in the interests of future consumption) by&#13;
the government. This assumption is questionable,&#13;
3/   Harberger (1971).&#13;
j^/  These opportunities are now quite widespread with the growth of the&#13;
branch networks of the organized financial sector: 900 rural banks, 1200&#13;
branches of the commercial banks, plus the branches of the savings and&#13;
loan associations, the private development banks and the Development Bank&#13;
of the Philippines. Indeed, the branches of the commercial banks have&#13;
spread rapidly largely to increase the resource base from deposits,&#13;
which accounted for 75-77% of incremental resources in 1976-77 (see&#13;
Chapter 2). A national savings campaign was also initiated by the&#13;
Government in the mid'70s. Apart from these channels for mobilizing&#13;
savings, secondary activities have been promoted such as piggeries,&#13;
garment crafts and other "cottage" industries. It is also very likely&#13;
that private investment in education and dwellings by the families&#13;
of wage earners are commensurate with their incomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
163 -&#13;
9.18      For people moving into skilled occupations, further adjustments&#13;
are needed to allow for (v) the costs of training labor and (vi) the workers'&#13;
preference for skilled over unskilled work. Finally, there are questions&#13;
regarding the quality and the experience of the workers and which must also&#13;
bear, in principle, on the estimation of the SWRs.&#13;
9.19      Given the obvious practical difficulties of estimating SWRs on&#13;
the above principles, the question arises whether it is necessary. The&#13;
above list of adjustments is a useful way of indicating the factors determi-&#13;
ning the opportunity cost of labor; but the same factors must also determine&#13;
actual wages if labor is to be drawn into the enterprise or project in question.&#13;
It is only when there are institutional influences or other constraints in the&#13;
labor market that actual wages begin to depart from the opportunity costs&#13;
above. In Chapter 8 it was suggested that such influences, if they exist at&#13;
all, are not very strong - particularly in the labor markets faced by small&#13;
firms. To a good approximation the supply price of labor appears to meet the&#13;
condition of 1/ "being the wage that must be paid to induce the worker into a&#13;
particular employment and reflects the workers' private valuat:ion of all its&#13;
aspects, pleasant and unpleasant."   Thus the SWRs and the actual wage rates&#13;
can probably be taken to be roughly equal. Further analysis, e.g. of uncertain-&#13;
ties might lead one to modify this conclusion, but actual wages seem to be the&#13;
best measure to go on at the present time. This conclusion if; not dis-similar&#13;
to that reached by Harberger (1971) in his analysis of the labor market in&#13;
India:&#13;
"Why have the differentials between urban unprotected sector wages&#13;
and rural wages been so persistent over time rather than being&#13;
eliminated as a consequence of more rapid migration flows? My&#13;
answer is that the differential in question is very largely a&#13;
self-equalising one. In rural areas of India most of the houses (or&#13;
huts) of rural labourers are built by themselves (wLth help from&#13;
family and friends), using local materials; they are very inexpensive,&#13;
if not virtually free. By contrast, even the most rudimentary urban&#13;
quarters have rents amounting to a third or more of the unprotected&#13;
urban wage. Food in the cities is also considerably more expensive&#13;
than in the villages, where largely local produce i.s consumed.&#13;
Transportation to and from work also typically claims a considerable&#13;
portion of the urban labourer's budget, while in the villages the&#13;
trip to the nearby fields is usually made on foot...I conclude,&#13;
then, that the social opportunity cost of labour to be used on a&#13;
project in a rural area is the going wage in that area while that of&#13;
labour to be used in an urban project is the prevailing wage in the&#13;
unprotected sector of the labour market in that area."&#13;
j/   Squire and van der Tak (1975), p.80.    For a more skeptical note on&#13;
relying too much on supply prices (even in the absence of distortions)&#13;
see Vaughn (1980); uncertainties and disequilibria in the labor markets&#13;
are her main concern.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 --&#13;
9.20      Using actual wages paid in small enterprises as a measure of&#13;
the opportunity costs of labor both favors investments in the provinces,&#13;
where wages are lower, and simplifies analysis. Estimates of shadow wage&#13;
rates are generally available only on a country-wide basis for one or perhaps&#13;
two categories of labor. Yet small enterprises have to pay wages that vary&#13;
with the skills, qualities and experience of the workers, as well as with&#13;
location and local labor market conditions. The information on wages are also&#13;
readily available to the appraisers of projects, who generally estimate the&#13;
wage bill when assessing the profitability of an enterprise and the project&#13;
before deciding whether or not to finance it. In using actual wages in this&#13;
way when estimating the returns to the investment, they are essentially&#13;
screening for projects that are consistent with the employment aims of the&#13;
program.&#13;

10. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS&#13;
10.1      Since the conclusions were set out in detail as indicated in the&#13;
preceding chapters, it is sufficient here to bring together some general&#13;
points. The first of these concerns the role of small industries in the&#13;
development process, and was examined at length in Chapters 6 and 7. It&#13;
was noted that most small industry programs implicitly assume that such&#13;
industries are a significant source of growth and labor absorption, and that&#13;
their own growth generates demands for the kinds of services to be provided&#13;
by the programs. The analysis of census data, interviews with small firms,&#13;
and the analysis in Part I of the response of small firms to the program,&#13;
each support this assumption.&#13;
10.2      The evidence shows, for instance, a rapid emergence and growth of&#13;
small and medium scale, establishment-based manufacturing throughout the&#13;
country, in which the rates of labor absorption are significantly higher than&#13;
in large scale. A sizeable, if not precisely known, fraction of labor absorp-&#13;
tion recorded in the aggregate statistics for medium and large scale firms is&#13;
also due to the expansion of a small proportion of once small firms through&#13;
the size structure. Household manufacturing still remains a significant&#13;
source of employment, and is in fact growing rapidly in the so-called urban&#13;
informal sector, but is gradually being superseded by workshop and factory&#13;
production elsewhere.&#13;
10.3      These trends and changes are particularly apparent in - but not&#13;
confined to - the small towns and urban centers in the provinces, where&#13;
infrastructure conditions and the nature of the product markets favor manu-&#13;
facturing on a small and medium scale. The growth of agriculture and of&#13;
the regional urban base itself are generating the markets, and in doing so&#13;
are helping to localize the structural changes from rural-agricultural to&#13;
urban-industrial development. What is remarkable about the trends and changes&#13;
reported, however - and in particular the emergence and growth of SMIs - is&#13;
that the industrial tariffs and incentives policies have historically worked&#13;
against small scale firms, the majority of which function in sectors with&#13;
low or negative effective rates of protection.&#13;
10.4      In the text (Chapter 6) we highlighted the heterogeneity of small&#13;
scale manufacturing activities, both household and non-household, and to&#13;
the underlying complexity of the structural changes now occurring. While&#13;
the overall patterns are clear, it is possible to find many exceptions -&#13;
e.g. the extraordinary growth of "back-yard" workshops in the engineering&#13;
sectors, and the growth of small-scale garments industries, fostered uhder the&#13;
"putting'out" system, to cite two cases.   Also we found that small and large&#13;
scale manufacturing frequently have a non-conpeting or complementary relation-&#13;
ship, although this may change with the growth of provincial markets and with&#13;
infrastructure improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 166 -&#13;
10.5      Turning to the small firms themselves, we found (as have others)&#13;
that the large majority are financed by family savings, retained earnings,&#13;
trade credits and sometimes by borrowings in the informal markets; compara-&#13;
tively little;institutional finance is forthcoming, except for that provided&#13;
through the Government's programs or for borrowers of good standing. The&#13;
demand for institutional finance is small for very small firms, but rises&#13;
when a significant expansion of output and investment is being contemplated.&#13;
Although some firms rely solely on retained earnings, the majority seek to&#13;
"blend" several sources, depending on the extent, timing and maturity of&#13;
the credit that is required, and on its availability. With the emergence&#13;
and growth of small industries throughout the country their demand for insti-&#13;
tutional finance is rising.&#13;
10.6      Hence it is relevant to address the two principal constraints&#13;
on the supply of finance from public and private financial institutions.&#13;
10.7      The first constraint concerns the structure of financial incentives&#13;
open to the private sector, which are currently determined by various interest&#13;
rate ceilings and regulations on borrowing and lending. Our detailed analysis&#13;
of these in Part I (Chapters 2 and 3) shows that, at the time of writing,&#13;
there are no prospects of long-run profits from lending privately raised&#13;
resources to small enterprises - unless there is a drop in the costs of these&#13;
resources. Thus the private sector has not followed up on the Government's&#13;
initiative to establish a lending program, and there is an almost exclusive&#13;
and growing dependence on Government finance (provided through DBP and IGLF),&#13;
with the risks being borne disproportionately by a small number of insti-&#13;
tutions. Furthermore, the lower interest rates offered by the Government's&#13;
programs is attracting many borrowers who could obtain credits commercially&#13;
without the programs, and this is leading to considerable congestion and&#13;
queuing (Chapter 4), with many of the less articulate and less influential&#13;
owners of small firms being closed off entirely from the organized financial&#13;
sector. The issue of incentives is quantitatively important in view of the&#13;
huge volume of resources in the private sector relative to those that can be&#13;
made available through the Government's programs.&#13;
10.8      The second constraint, afflicting all institutions, and thus a&#13;
large number of sound and efficient firms, are undoubtedly the risks of&#13;
financing unsound and inefficient firms. In the early phases of developing&#13;
a lending program the difficulties of distinguishing between the two are&#13;
undoubtedly a drawback, and lead to significant losses. We did find, however,&#13;
that these sources of risk declined with the accumulation of information and&#13;
experience within the institutions, and with the development of appraisal,&#13;
supervision and internal control procedures, as intended by the program.&#13;
These developments alone lead to external benefits in that sound and efficient&#13;
firms are no longer driven out of the organized capital markets on account of&#13;
the "lemons", and we believe that these benefits are worth seeking given the&#13;
emergence and growth of SMIs in the country. Hence we have concluded that the&#13;
role of the programs in cushioning the initial risks is being fulfilled, but&#13;
that it is necessary to address the issue of financial incentives if the&#13;
programs are to have both broader and longer-run benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
10.9      Apart from the general issue of incentives, there are a number of&#13;
ways in which, it seems to us, the scope of the programs could be broadened&#13;
while reducing the administrative costs and risks:-&#13;
(i) Working Capital Finance. The small and medium industries&#13;
program has so far over-emphasized the finance of fixed assets and under-&#13;
emphasized the finance of working capital through short-term lending facili-&#13;
ties. A greater emphasis on the latter would reduce risks, be more attrac-&#13;
tive to the commercial banks, and would be consistent with the employment&#13;
and regional objectives of the programs.&#13;
(ii) Non-Industrial Enterprises. Broadening the scope of programs&#13;
towards non-industrial enterprises - and towards trading and service enter-&#13;
prises in particular - would improve access of small manufacturing firms to&#13;
markets and materials supplies and provide added conduits for working capital&#13;
finance.&#13;
(iii) Small Loan End of IGLF. For loans of less than about P 150-200&#13;
thousand, lending through IGLF is generally unprofitable; it is also not&#13;
possible below the P 50 thousand floor limit. Yet there are a very large&#13;
number of firms seeking loans in this range. There are also institutions with&#13;
the necessary basis and experience for making small loans efficiently in&#13;
provincial communities, but which were not qualified for making the larger&#13;
IGLF loans. Thus involving them in lending through IGLF led to high arrears&#13;
rates and bad debts, and to the exclusion of those bo4rowers they could best&#13;
deal with. Making IGLF more profitable at the small loan end, and possibly&#13;
removing the floor limit, could greatly widen the scope of the program.&#13;
(iv) Risk Reducing Institutions. A forum for the exchange of&#13;
information and experiences between institutions is needed, together with the&#13;
establishment of a common credit record keeping system.&#13;
(v) Industrial Extension. This program has served both educational&#13;
and screening purposes in providing a large number of small provincial firms&#13;
with access to financial institutions for the first time; it has also provided&#13;
counselling and referral services. The main danger ahead is the possibility&#13;
of its becoming part of the bureaucracy of administered credit on account of&#13;
the growing dependence, referred to above, of small firms on the Government's&#13;
financing programs. Involvement of the extensionists in post-appraisal (super-&#13;
visory) services, and a system of ex post accountability for the projects,&#13;
would also help to improve the quality of the services.&#13;
(vi) The Employment Issue and Project Selection. The rapid growth&#13;
of labor supply and the low rates of labor absorption in the corporate sector&#13;
has led to concerns in the Philippines (as in other countries) over the&#13;
prospect of rising unenployment and underemployment. This was indeed one&#13;
reason why the SMI program was introduced, on the grounds, now familiar, that&#13;
small industries are more labor intensive than large industries. Taking the&#13;
logic further, there was a preference for financing only those projects having&#13;
an incremental capital-labor ratio below a certain threshold; those above it&#13;
were often rejected. We have suggested, however, that projects are best&#13;
l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
judged by the robust if old fashioned criterion, the rate of return to capital;&#13;
that is, the loan appraisers and extensionists are doing the right thing in&#13;
considering only profitable projects. Our reasons for this were set out in&#13;
detail in chapters 8 and 9, with chapter 8 providing an analysis of the&#13;
changing conditions of employment in the country over the part 30 years.&#13;
10.10     The last and most general conclusion of the report is that, the&#13;
more efficient the leading sector policies, the more efficient the small&#13;
enterprise programs are likely to be. Lower and more uniform tariffs on&#13;
manufacturers are now being considered and, if implemented, should encourage&#13;
growth in the more efficient sectors. As we saw in Chapter 7, drawing on&#13;
the evidence of the study of Bautista and Powers, small enterprises are con-&#13;
sistently located in the more efficient sectors, and in sectors that have&#13;
suffered most from the adverse effects of the industrial tariff policies.&#13;
While there are well-known difficulties in ascertaining the precise conse-&#13;
quences of changes in tariffs and incentives on output and employment in&#13;
particular economic activities, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the&#13;
majority of small scale activities would stand to benefit from the changes&#13;
that are now being contemplated for the tariff structure. But the main&#13;
benefits would be to stimulate product markets via growth. Agriculture in&#13;
particular should stand to gain, with generally beneficial effects on the&#13;
growth of the provincial markets for non-food goods and services; as noted&#13;
it is the growth of these markets that explains the current high rates of&#13;
emergence and growth of small and medium industries in the provinces. In-&#13;
vestments in small-holder agriculture and its supporting infrastructure and&#13;
services should work in the same direction. Also under review are proposals&#13;
to reduce the labor-saving incentives in the current investment and interest&#13;
rate policies, or even to introduce labor-using incentives. The effects on&#13;
markets should be similar, and not insignificant in magnitude.&#13;

NOTE ON THE USE OF TERMS&#13;
The use of terms differs between agencies in the Philippines.&#13;
The Ministry of Industry and the financial institutions classify industries&#13;
into cottage (or home),    small, medium and large industries according to&#13;
assets as follows:&#13;
Asset Range (P million)           Classification&#13;
Less than 0.1                     Cottage (or home) industries&#13;
0.1 to 1.0                        Small industries&#13;
1.0 to 4.0                        Medium industries&#13;
Over 4.0                          Large industries&#13;
When referring to the Goverrment 's Small and Medium Industries Program&#13;
these terms are used to avoid confusion. Elsewhere the term "small&#13;
enterprise" is used in a broad sense, and includes enterprises in the&#13;
tertiary sector.&#13;
Most of these terms are arbitrary, and could be changed without&#13;
seriously affecting the analysis. An exception, ho*ever, is the term&#13;
cottage (or home) industries which confuses two quite different levels&#13;
of activity. In 1975 there were about 900 thousand people who were&#13;
working in manufacturing activities within their homes (see Table 1.3 above)&#13;
or at least not working in identifiable establishment and workshops;&#13;
for nearly two decades there has been no discernable growth in the level&#13;
.of such employment in the country. In contrast, the same period saw a&#13;
rapid increase in the number of non-household manufacturing establishments&#13;
and workshops, and which would come under the above definitions of cottage&#13;
industries. For purposes of analyzing size structure and other aspects&#13;
of small industry development it is necessary to distinguish more&#13;
1/ The term 'home' industries is used by DBP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -&#13;
precisely between household and establishment-based manufacturing, as far as&#13;
the data permit. The following table shows how MOI definitions compare with&#13;
the size distribution categories in the establishment censuses; household&#13;
employment is normally estimated as a residual between the establishment&#13;
censuses and population censuses (or the labor force surveys non-census years):&#13;

/1  The average assets per worker in 1974 for industries with 5-19 workers&#13;
was P4,700 say P5,000 in 1975, so that enterprises with 20 workers&#13;
would have assets of P100,000 on average.&#13;
Source: Censuses of Establishments and Population Census.&#13;
Except when the discussions specifically relate to the financing and&#13;
extension programs, the terms followed will relate to the left-hand side&#13;
of the above table.&#13;
While the intention of the analysis is to examine the full size&#13;
structure of industry, the NCSO's census and survey data on establishments&#13;
are often only grouped into 'small' and 'large', the former being establishments&#13;
with less than 10 employees in census years, and less than 20 in survey years;&#13;
the tables and comments in the text make it clear which of these two sources&#13;
are being used.&#13;

FINANCING OF SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISES&#13;
Financial Institutions in the Philippines&#13;
Banking Institutions&#13;
1.        Commercial Banks.   At the end of 1978, there were 26 private banks,&#13;
1/&#13;
2 government owned banks and 4 foreign banks.      Comercial banks are by far&#13;
the largest source of institutional credit in the country, accounting for&#13;
55% of the total assets of the financial system. Over 70% of commercial bank&#13;
lending is to manufacturing and commerce, the share having increased&#13;
steadily from 55% in 1960. Most commercial bank lending is short-term and&#13;
serves to provide trade credits and working caotal to industry and&#13;
commerce; for the period January-August 1977, 60% of total credit granted&#13;
was for a year, 102 was for 1-5 years and 0.6% was for over 5 years. v      The&#13;
comparable figures for 1976 were 68.62, 0.6% and 1.02T.    The above figures,&#13;
however, do not reflect the element of rollover credit for long-term finance&#13;
which, though unquantifiable, appears to be significant.&#13;
2.        Develooment Finance Institutions.   The government-owned Deve-&#13;
lopment Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the privately-owned Private Deve-&#13;
lopment Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) and, to a lesser extent, the&#13;
Philippine Investment Systems Organization (PISO) are the major providers of&#13;
long-term finance. As of December 31, 1978, the total assets of DBP, PDC?&#13;
and PISO were P 18.1 billion, 2 1 billion an4 P 189.3 million respectively.&#13;
1/ As of December 1977 the percentage distribution of assets were as follows:&#13;
Private domestic banks 59%, foreign banks 11%, and government-owned banks&#13;
30:.&#13;
2/ The remaining 38.4% was in the form of short-term demand loans.&#13;

ANNEX II TO CHAPTER II (Continued)&#13;
3.        DBP was established by the Government in 1958 with a mandate&#13;
to supply long-term credit to agriculture and industry. DBP plays a&#13;
vital role in the economy as it is by far the largest supplier of both&#13;
long-term local currency and 'oreign exchange resources. As of December 31,&#13;
1978 DBP had loans outstanding of about P 11 billion.&#13;
4.        Although PDC? is defined as an investment bank its main busiaess is&#13;
the provision of long-term loans which accounted for 76t of its total assets&#13;
as of December 31, 1978, equity investments occupying a relatively minor&#13;
(3.5%) position. PDCP lends primarily for manufacturing and transportation.&#13;
5.        PISO, incorporated in 1974, is privately owned and operates as&#13;
an invesment banking institution. Until recently PISO operated primarily&#13;
in the money market but is increasingly gotng in for term lending.    As&#13;
of December 31, 1978 its money market operations and long-term loans&#13;
accounted for 746 and 4.1' respectively of its total assets.    ?ISO lends&#13;
principally to manufacturing and service industries and for transportation&#13;
equipment.&#13;
6.        Private Develoement Banks (PDB).   The 35 PDBs have been promoted&#13;
by DBP/Central Bank of the Philippines in various regions to mobilize&#13;
local savings and make resources available to both agriculture and industry.&#13;
As of June 30, 1978, the total resources of PDBs amounted to P 666 mil-&#13;
lion with a deposit base of P 383 million. As of the same date, the tocal&#13;
outstanding long-term portfolio outstanding of PDBs amounted to P 399.2 mil-&#13;
lion. In terms of sectoral distribution, 532 went to agriculture, 38% to&#13;
industry and 9% for miscellaneous activities such as low cost housing,&#13;
vocational schools and comercial loans.&#13;

ANNEX II TO CHAPTER II (Continued)&#13;
7.        Rural Banks.   Rural banks are unit banks which are miunicipality&#13;
specific and provide short-term loans primarily to agriculture. The rural&#13;
banking system comprises around 906 privatel7-owned banks. At the end of&#13;
1978 their total assets amounted to P 4.0 billion while deposits amounted&#13;
to P 1.5 billion.&#13;
Non-bank Financial Institutions&#13;
1/&#13;
8.        Investment Houses.   The 12 - investment houses are the only&#13;
entities which can engage in the underwriting of securities on a firm basis.&#13;
The volume of underwriting business undertaken by the investment houses was&#13;
minimal during the period 1970-76. During this time, money market operations&#13;
were extremely profitable and the investment houses tended to concentrate cn&#13;
these.  It is estimated that in 1976 approximately 80% of their resources&#13;
accrued from such operations.   the reduction in the profitability of money&#13;
market operations has resulted in investment houses going in for more under-&#13;
writing and syndication. However, relatively Little lqng-term lending is&#13;
done by investment houses.&#13;
9.        Finance Comoanies.   The Securities and Exchange Commission has&#13;
260 finance companies registered with it. Of these, the 42 largest account&#13;
for 80% of the turnover. At the end of 1978, the finance companies had total&#13;
resources of P 7.3 billion while loans outstanding amounted to about&#13;
P 4.8 billion. Most of the finance companies are subsidiaries of major&#13;
commercial banks and are engaged in financing the purchase of consumer dur-&#13;
L/ As of September 30, 1978.&#13;
2/ The most notable exception is the Private Development Corporation of&#13;
the Philippines which is classified as an investment house but operates&#13;
as a long-term lending institution.&#13;

ables, and providing short- and medium-tarm credit to local 3anufacturers and&#13;
traders to finance inventory, receivables and transport equipmenc. Until 1978&#13;
finance companies were aot covered by CB interest rate ceilings and, conse-&#13;
quently, could charge up to 24Z a year on discounting of receivables. Under a&#13;
recent Prasidential Decree, finance companies are to be directly regulated by&#13;
CB with respect to the interest rate charged on assignment of cred':, purchase&#13;
of installment papers and accounts receivable.&#13;

owners after they were approved by the financial or licencing institution.&#13;

most common reason for withdrawing projects is failure to satisfy the&#13;
institution's collateral requirements.&#13;

/1  The loan requests are often different to the amounts granted, the&#13;
main tendency being for the banks to reduce the working capital&#13;
component. This is for example evident in comparing MASICAP requests&#13;
with the actual loans granted by DBP or through IGLF. The sample&#13;
cases reported on by Mrs. Fajardo (1979) give the following:&#13;
Percent Distribution&#13;
Purpose                 MASICAP Requests.   DBP Projects    IGLF Projects&#13;
Permanent Working Capital    41                 16                26&#13;

Note:  The three distributions are taken from different samples, but one&#13;
can see that DBP's finance provides on average for much lower levels&#13;
of working capital than MASICAP's recommendations.&#13;

/1  Regular as opposed to seasonal or casual labor only, except where otherwise&#13;
noted.&#13;
/2  Estimates for an intermediate year (1967) are also provided in Gibb's report&#13;
along with a breakdown between the town of Gapan and the three rural towns;&#13;
the latter together accounted for about 50% of employment in 1971 and expanded&#13;
at roughly the same rate over the 10 year period.&#13;
/3. Informal sector employment was estimated at 2,400 in 1971, of which half were&#13;
in retail trade (sari-sari stores mainly).&#13;
/4 Electrical appliances, gas stoves, velhicle parts, etc.&#13;
/5 Motor powered, typically an adaptation of a 120 cc. motorcycle. "A family&#13;
with three or four children is readily accomodated (or) several pigs, 500&#13;
pounds of rice or fertilizer .....&#13;
/6 Horse drawn carriages.&#13;
/7 Mainly traditional crafts: pottery, coffin makers.&#13;
/8 Seasonal workers.&#13;
/9  The 1961 figures are underestima t,es since Gibb was unable to count businesses&#13;
that had failed in the period.   The growth rates are thus over estimates.&#13;

Source Notes:  The regional distribution of total manufacturing employment can&#13;
be obtained from the regional volumes of the 1970 Population&#13;
Census; the data are summarized in the 1970 NEDA Situation Report&#13;
from which the above were taken. Regional data on employment&#13;
in establishments are available in the 1972 Census of Establishments,&#13;
but no data are available for 1970. The percent distribution&#13;
among regions obtaining in 1972 were applied to the 1970 estimate&#13;
of total employment in large establishments; the latter was&#13;
obtained by straight-line interpolation between the 1967 and 1972&#13;
establishment census figures and is about 8% lower than for 1972.&#13;
Employment in small scale establishments and households was&#13;
calculated as a residual.&#13;

/1  The &lt; 20 and &gt; 20 ranges refer to establishment size by No. of Workers.&#13;
/2  Differences in definitions of employment between the four sources quoted&#13;
above make it difficult to compare the estimates. Briefly, the following&#13;
principles were followed:&#13;
(i)  The establishment censuses, establishment surveys and the labor&#13;
force surveys each estimate current employment, and (as far as&#13;
one can see) are comparable.&#13;
(ii) The 1970 population census also consistent with (i).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -&#13;
ANNEX TO CHAPTER VI&#13;
-Table 6.5: (continued)&#13;
(iii)  The 1975 population census used a more stringent&#13;
definition of employment (a person had to have worked&#13;
in the activity for more than 10 hours per week and&#13;
for not less than 10 weeks per year). It was therefore&#13;
adjusted to make it comparable to the data for earlier&#13;
years and with the 1975 establishment census and labor&#13;
force survey.&#13;
(iv)   The 1960 population census definitions were also&#13;
consistent with (i), but there appear to have been&#13;
problems in classifying women's labor as between&#13;
manufacturing activities NEC, classified manufacturing&#13;
activities. The data were also adjusted.&#13;
The basis of the adjustments were as follows:-&#13;
1960a: The manufacturing employment in each region are the&#13;
"raw" census data.   The estimates for Manila and Rizal were&#13;
clearly underestimated by the census since they imply no&#13;
employment in establishments of less than 20 workers, and no&#13;
employment in households - i.e., no "informal" manufacturing&#13;
sector. They also imply that only 6.6% of the population of&#13;
over ten years old in Manila and Rizal were in manufacturing&#13;
in 1960, as compared with approximately 12% in 1970 and 14%&#13;
in 1975. There are reasons for thinking that the share of&#13;
employment in manufacturing (in Manila and Rizal) were higher&#13;
in 1960 than in 1970 since import substitution had led to a&#13;
high growth rate of manufacturing output in the 1950s, but a slow&#13;
growth rate in the 1960s (see Chapter 5). One problem appears&#13;
to be the ways in which services ahd women's labor were counted&#13;
in 1960, since the census shows high percentages in these categories,&#13;
compared with those of the labor force surveys.    Further the&#13;
"miscellaneous" category for manufacturing was quite high in the&#13;
census, indicating a possible problem of classification. Taking&#13;
12% of working age population in Manila and Rizal to be in&#13;
manufacturing in 1960, gives an estimate of 217 thousand total&#13;
manufacturing employment in the area, and 933 thousand for the&#13;
whole country. The labor force survey gives a total employment of?&#13;
1036; the difference is probably due to seasonality and sampling&#13;
errors, since the 1960 census used the same definition of employment&#13;
as was used in the labor force surveys to obtain consistency with&#13;
the 1970 and 1975 data, the total employment in each region is&#13;
scaled up by the ratio 1036/933. This gives the estimates shown&#13;
for 1960b.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 205 -&#13;
ANNEX TO CHAPTER VI&#13;
Table 6.5: (Continued)&#13;
19Z0: The 1970 census used the same definitions of employed&#13;
workers as do the labor force surveys. Hence they are consistent&#13;
with the latter, and in fact the 1970 census estimate of total&#13;
manufacturing employment is close to the estimate that would be&#13;
obtained from interpolating the annual labor force surveys in&#13;
neighboring years (no labor force survey was conducted in 1970).&#13;
In 1975 a different and more stringent definition of employment&#13;
was used which leads to lower estimates than those obtained in&#13;
the labor force surveys.&#13;
1975a: Employment totals in each region are the raw census data,&#13;
reclassified as far as the maps available to us would permit,&#13;
according to the boundaries used for the 1960 and 1970 data&#13;
tabulated above.&#13;
1975b:  The differences in definitions of employment between the&#13;
establishment censuses and the labor force surveys are likely&#13;
to have affected mainly the census' estimates of those employed&#13;
in households, since those employed in establishments of over&#13;
20 workers are mostly regular, and would meet the definition&#13;
noted in (iii) above. Hence we need to adjust the residuals in&#13;
1975a.  The following procedure was used.   Let xi represent the&#13;
adjusted and y the unadjustedtresidual for each region (that is,&#13;
the y 's are 16, 407, 190, 118 and total 871, as shown under&#13;
1975af. Then&#13;
455 + Eyi - 1326 from column 1975a,&#13;
and  455 + Zxi - 1660 from the total in 1975b.&#13;
Let x /yi - k, the adjustment factor; k is then 1.383 from these&#13;
two expressions; this is the figure used to get the x's shown in&#13;
column 1975b.&#13;
/3   The 6.6% figure is for the period 1970-75 (using bhe estimate under&#13;
1975b).&#13;

/2  The estimate in the 1975 census is the second and higher figure; it&#13;
seems unusually high, since the population was Qnly 177 in 1970. -&#13;
There may have been some boundary changes. The first figure is the&#13;
one given in the 1977 Philippine Statistical Yearbook, which appears&#13;
to have used consistent boundaries.&#13;

Accounts.&#13;
Notes: Daily rates are estimated from annual rates assuming 300 working&#13;
days per worker per year. The owners' share in net value added&#13;
(after expenditures on fixed assets) is taken to equal their net&#13;
earnings, on the assumption that tax payments and loan repayments&#13;
are negligible for small enterprises; small manufacturing&#13;
establishments in the Philippines are eligible for tax&#13;
exemptions for six years after registering with NACIDA.&#13;

J   These correspond to-the 1971 distribution as calculated by the FIES.&#13;
2/ The income distributions shown in columns (1) to (4) are for 1971; it follows that all calculations and income ranges are in 1971 prices.&#13;
3/ Excludes families vhose incomes are from ownership of property and capital, or from gifts.&#13;
4/ Eatimated using the percentages obtaining in columns (1) to (4). With the exception of 1971. there are not actual distributions (see source notes).&#13;
Sources and Basis of Estimates.&#13;
The main source is the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), BCS Survey of Households Bulletin, Series 34, 1971 Table 60.      The Distribution&#13;
of Families in 1965 and 1971 are also taken from thia source. For 1976, the estimates were made as follows. The 1977 Labor Yearbook, Departmnt&#13;
of Labor, gives the numbers of industrial wer s. fSo    Uo   thru 1976 .  (see Annex Table 14).  The percent chatges in the number of families&#13;
primarily dependent on entrepreneurial activity were then assumed to be the same as the percent changes in     elf-_loy-workers (but not of&#13;
unpaid family workers) in the same sector. The percentage increase (between 1971 and 1976) in the number of families dependent on wage and&#13;
salary work was estimated in the same way.&#13;
To estimate the distributions, percentages and numbers of families for the three years, the 1971 percentage distributions shown in colums (1)&#13;
through (4) were applied to the total number of families classified according to source of income for the respective years. Thus column (5),&#13;
rov (I) for 1965 equals (1. 9x 1966 + 3.1 x 456 + 5.6 x 192 + 8.9 x 2229)/100 - 260; etc. Using the procedure, the figures in columns (6) and&#13;
(9) are actual data, while those in (5), (7), (8), and (10) are estimated effects of the changes in occupational structure, holding the&#13;
distribution of incomes constant vithin each occupational category.&#13;
Supplementary Calculations&#13;
(1)  Estimates of the income range of the bottom two quintiles for 1971. From column (9), the percentage of families with incomes of up to&#13;
P1500 ia (5.0 + 12.0 + 12.2) - 29.2% and with incomes of up to P2000 is (29.2 + 11.9) * 41.11. Those with incomes in the range P1500&#13;
to 2000 are then divided into families above, and families below the "bottom 401 limit on a straight line basis. The dividing line&#13;
for the bottom 40% is then 1500 + 500(40 - 29.2)/(41.1 - 29.2) - 1958 pesos.&#13;
(2) Estimate of the effects of changes in employment structure (holding the income distribution curves vithin each occupational&#13;
category constant) on the average real incomes of the botbom 40%. Using the linear method given in note (I) above, the income&#13;
range of the bottom 407 is estimated to be P1869 or below in 1965, and P1964 or below in 1976. Using these figures,the data&#13;
in colusnn  (8)  and (10), and taking mid-points on each block of the histogram, gives the following average real incomes for&#13;
1965 and 1976 respectively.&#13;
0.054 x 250 + .128 x 750 + .128 x 1250 + 0.09(1500 + 1869)/2 - P400&#13;
0.049 x 250 + .117 x 750 + .121 x 1250 + .113(1500 + 1964)/2 - P436&#13;
The increase average real income is then 9%. -There is a downward bias in both of the average income estimates for the bottom 40S&#13;
on account of the linear approximations involved.&#13;

            Small enterprises and development policy in
            the Philippines : a case study
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report presents an ex post
            evaluation of the Small and Medium Industries Program
            introduced in the Philippines in 1974, and reassesses the
            assumptions behind the programs. Its aim is to report on the
            Philippines' experience in a manner that it is hoped
            will be useful to those involved with such programs in other
            countries, as well as the Philippines, and who are
            interested in their relevance for industrial development. It
            examines the role of small industries in the development
            process, and how that role is affected by the structure of
            industrial tariffs and investment incentives and by policies
            towards agriculture. The part presenting the ex post studies
            reveals how specific programs in finance and extension have
            worked out in practice, and what lessons emerge. It presents
            first hand evidence on risks and administrative costs, and
            shows how risks have led to capital market failures in the
            past. It makes the case for a relaxation of administrative
            constraints on the structure of interest rates together with
            a continuance or risk-guarantee and extension schemes to
            solve the risk problem, which would persist even if interest
            rates were not administered.
