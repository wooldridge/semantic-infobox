IntroDuCtIon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In fiscal year 2007, the rapid expansion of the ICSID caseload continued unabated. With&#13;
the registration of twenty-six new arbitration proceedings, the number of ICSID cases&#13;
administered during the fiscal year reached a new record of one hundred and thirty. The&#13;
growth of the caseload continued to be driven by treaty-based arbitration proceedings. At&#13;
the end of the fiscal year, the number of the conciliation and arbitration cases registered with&#13;
ICSID since its inception reached two hundred and thirty-six. In addition, ICSID provided&#13;
administrative services in ten arbitration proceedings conducted under theArbitration Rules of&#13;
the United Nations Commission on InternationalTrade Law (UNCITRAL) and in an expert&#13;
determination proceeding conducted under the provisions of the IndusWatersTreaty 1960.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICSID's membership increased to 144 Contracting States in the past year, following&#13;
the ratification of the ICSID Convention by the Republic of Serbia. Other important&#13;
membership developments included the signing of the ICSID Convention by Canada and&#13;
the notice of denunciation received from the Republic of Bolivia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre's publication and knowledge dissemination program remained active during&#13;
the year.Two issues of the ICSID Review--Foreign Investment Law Journal were completed&#13;
in addition to five releases updating the Centre's collections of Investment Laws of theWorld and&#13;
Investment Treaties and two issues of ICSID's newsletter, News from ICSID. In co-operation&#13;
with other arbitration institutions and international organizations, ICSID organized and&#13;
hosted two major conferences on international arbitration. Staff of the Centre participated&#13;
as speakers and panelists in more than thirty conferences and educational events mostly in&#13;
the field of investor-State arbitration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal year 2007 has been one of change for ICSID. To meet the challenges of the&#13;
significantly increased workload, the new ICSID Secretary-General, Ana Palacio, has&#13;
begun a process of reorganizing the staffing structure of the Secretariat. In May 2007,&#13;
Ms. Palacio announced the appointment of Nassib G. Ziadé, at the time Executive&#13;
Secretary of the World Bank Administrative Tribunal, as ICSID's new Chief Counsel.&#13;
A major area of emphasis of ICSID's new management during fiscal year 2007 was the&#13;
launching of an initiative to upgrade the technological means by which the Centre can&#13;
achieve more efficient case management and knowledge dissemination in the field of&#13;
investor-State dispute settlement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Details of the developments in the Centre's activities in fiscal year 2007 are set forth below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The Republic of Serbia became the 144th ICSID Contracting State by completing the&#13;
membership procedures in June 2007. In December 2006, the Convention was signed on&#13;
behalf of Canada by its Ambassador to the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On May 2, 2007, the World Bank received a written notice of denunciation of the ICSID&#13;
Convention from the Republic of Bolivia. In accordance with Article 75 of the ICSID&#13;
Convention, the depositary (the World Bank) notified all ICSID signatory States of the&#13;
Republic of Bolivia's denunciation of the Convention.The denunciation will take effect&#13;
six months after the receipt of the notice, i.e., on November 3, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A complete list of Contracting States and other signatories of the ICSID Convention as at&#13;
June 30, 2007 is provided in Annex 1.&#13;

&#13;
DIsputes before the Centre&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the course of fiscal year 2007,the Centre registered twenty-six new arbitration proceedings&#13;
resulting in a new record of one hundred and thirty cases administered by the Centre during a&#13;
fiscal year.Ten percent of the cases administered were conducted under theAdditional Facility&#13;
Rules while the remaining ninety percent were ICSID Convention proceedings.One hundred&#13;
and eight cases were pending before the Centre at the end of the fiscal year.The total number&#13;
of cases registered with the Centre since its inception reached two hundred and thirty-six.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Twenty-two of the new cases were instituted under the ICSID Convention and four&#13;
proceedings under the Additional Facility Rules. Fifteen of the new cases were initiated on&#13;
the basis of ICSID arbitration provisions contained in bilateral investment treaties. (In one&#13;
of these proceedings, the claimant invoked alternatively an ICSID arbitration clause in an&#13;
investment contract between the disputing parties.) Jurisdiction was based on investment&#13;
contracts in seven further proceedings. In three of the new cases, investors sought to&#13;
establish ICSID jurisdiction on the basis of the investor-State dispute settlement provisions&#13;
of the Energy Charter Treaty. In another proceeding, the investment law of the host state&#13;
was asserted as the basis for ICSID jurisdiction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the new cases,the Centre registered an application for the institution of annulment&#13;
proceedings and in another case a request for rectification of an award.Both of these proceedings&#13;
concern awards previously rendered by ICSID tribunals in the course of fiscal year 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Nineteen arbitration proceedings were concluded. Seventeen of these were original&#13;
arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention and two were Additional Facility&#13;
cases. Fourteen awards were rendered and five proceedings were discontinued following&#13;
settlement reached by the parties.Arbitral tribunals declined ICSID jurisdiction in four of&#13;
the awards rendered in the past year. Four awards rejected all claims on the merits. In five&#13;
further proceedings, ICSID tribunals upheld the claims in whole or in part. One award&#13;
embodied the parties' settlement agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the fiscal year, decisions were also issued in five proceedings concerning&#13;
applications for post award remedies under the ICSID Convention. One decision was&#13;
issued by an arbitral tribunal on an application by a party for the rectification of an&#13;
award. In four other proceedings, ad hoc committees issued decisions on applications for&#13;
annulment of awards. Three of these decisions rejected the respective applications for&#13;
annulment, while one decision annulled the award previously rendered by an ICSID&#13;
tribunal. One of these decisions also contained a Separate Opinion and Statement of&#13;
Dissent by one of the ad hoc committee members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the past year, arbitral tribunals issued a number of procedural orders and decisions.&#13;
These included nine decisions upholding jurisdiction; a decision by an arbitral tribunal on&#13;
liability; an order in response to a petition by third parties for participation as amici curiae;&#13;
three orders concerning the confidentiality of the proceedings; an order on determination&#13;
of damages; and a decision by an ad hoc committee on a request for stay of enforcement of&#13;
an award previously rendered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
About half of the one hundred and thirty cases administered by ICSID during the year&#13;
involved countries from Latin and Central America, while twenty percent of the cases&#13;
involved respondent States from the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region. Eleven&#13;
percent of the cases involved countries located in sub-Saharan Africa.The remaining cases&#13;
were, as in previous years, almost evenly divided among countries in North America, in&#13;
the Middle East and North Africa and in East Asia and the Pacific.About half of the cases&#13;
pending during the fiscal year concerned projects in the mining, power generation and&#13;
public utility sectors of the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Twenty-seven hearings and twenty-three different sessions were held in the cases pending&#13;
before ICSID in the course of fiscal year 2007. About one third of these sessions and&#13;
hearings were held at the seat of the Centre inWashington, D.C., while the remainder took&#13;
place at various other locations in North America, Europe and Latin America or by means&#13;
of audio and video conferencing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 0 7                                                                &#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
During the year, arbitral tribunals were constituted or reconstituted in twenty-four cases&#13;
pending before ICSID. An ad hoc committee was also constituted. Fifty individuals from&#13;
twenty different countries were appointed to serve as arbitrators in ICSID proceedings.The&#13;
parties or party-appointed arbitrators nominated sixty-nine percent of the total sixty-eight&#13;
appointments made during the fiscal year, while thirty-one percent of the appointments&#13;
were made by ICSID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The proceedings before the ICSID tribunals and ad hoc committees during the year were&#13;
conducted in one of the three official languages of ICSID (English, French and Spanish) in&#13;
seventy-one of the cases. In the remaining fifty-nine cases, two of the three languages were&#13;
used, in different combinations, as procedural languages of the proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the one hundred and thirty ICSID cases administered in the course of the&#13;
fiscal year, the Centre has, at the request of the parties and tribunals concerned, agreed&#13;
to provide administrative services to ten arbitration proceedings conducted under the&#13;
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The services furnished by ICSID for these proceedings&#13;
ranged from limited assistance with the organization of hearings and fund-holding to&#13;
full secretariat services in the administration of the respective proceeding. One of these&#13;
UNCITRAL Rules proceedings was concluded with an award during the fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One of the UNCITRAL Rules proceedings concerned three separate disputes, instituted&#13;
against the same State,which was heard by the same tribunal following the first consolidation&#13;
order ever issued under the Investment Chapter of the North American Free Trade&#13;
Agreement. During the year, ICSID's Secretary-General has also been requested to act as&#13;
appointing authority of arbitrators in UNCITRAL Rules proceedings. Furthermore, the&#13;
Centre continued to provide administrative support to an expert determination proceeding&#13;
under the provisions of the IndusWatersTreaty 1960.This proceeding was concluded in the&#13;
course of the year with a decision of the appointed neutral expert.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Details of significant procedural developments in each of the proceedings conducted under&#13;
the ICSID Convention and the Additional Facility Rules pending before the Centre in the&#13;
course of fiscal year 2007 are provided in Annex 2.&#13;

panels of ConCIlIators anD of arbItrators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Under the ICSID Convention, the Centre maintains a Panel of Conciliators and a Panel of&#13;
Arbitrators. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Convention, each Contracting State may designate&#13;
up to four persons to each Panel. Up to ten persons may be designated to each Panel by the&#13;
Chairman of the Administrative Council.All designees serve for a renewable period of six years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The ICSID Panels provide a source from which parties to ICSID proceedings may&#13;
select conciliators or arbitrators. Further, in the event that the Chairman of the ICSID&#13;
Administrative Council is called upon to appoint conciliators, arbitrators or ad hoc&#13;
committee members under Articles 30, 38 or 52 of the ICSID Convention, his appointees&#13;
must be drawn from the Panels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the course of the year, new designations to the ICSID Panels of Conciliators and of&#13;
Arbitrators were made by eight Contracting States: Belgium, Democratic Republic of the&#13;
Congo, Finland, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Samoa, Spain and Sweden.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Annex 3 provides a list of the designees appointed to the ICSID Panels during fiscal year 2007.&#13;
With these new designations, the Panels comprise 512 persons as at June 30, 2007. A complete&#13;
list of all Panel members is available on the ICSID website at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid.&#13;
&#13;

publICatIons&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the past year, the Centre issued two new releases for its ten-volume loose-leaf&#13;
collection Investment Laws of the World, which now comprises basic investment legislation&#13;
of 133 countries from all major regions of the world. The two releases contained new&#13;
or revised investment legislation passed by Botswana, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Kenya,&#13;
Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Republic of Korea,Tonga,Vanuatu, andVietnam.The releases&#13;
also provided subscribers with contact information of the national governmental agency in&#13;
charge of the promotion of foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre's second loose-leaf collection of InvestmentTreaties was expanded by three new&#13;
releases during fiscal year 2007.These releases added some 60 treaties, concluded between&#13;
52 countries in the period of 1961-2005. The number of treaties included in the collection&#13;
now stands at 1,140.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
During fiscal year 2007, two issues of the ICSID Review--Foreign Investment Law Journal&#13;
were prepared for publication. The ICSID Review contains materials on international&#13;
and domestic law relating to foreign investment and investment dispute settlement. The&#13;
recent issues included articles on the legal concept of "legitimate expectations" of foreign&#13;
investors; consolidation of investment arbitration proceedings; parallel litigation and foreign&#13;
investment dispute settlement; and the most recent amendments to the ICSID Rules and&#13;
Regulations, which came into effect on April 10, 2006.A number of recent decisions and&#13;
awards rendered in ICSID proceedings were also reproduced together with introductory&#13;
notes prepared by the Centre's staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Two issues of the Centre's semi-annual newsletter, News from ICSID, were published&#13;
during the past year.The issues discussed the recent amendments to the ICSID Rules and&#13;
Regulations, and included articles on the consultation period requirement in investment&#13;
treaties and on the Centre's involvement in an expert determination process pursuant to&#13;
the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In the past fiscal year, ICSID hosted the 23rd in the series of colloquia on international&#13;
arbitration, co-sponsored annually since 1983 by the American Arbitration Association&#13;
(AAA), the International Court of Arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce&#13;
(ICC) and ICSID.The colloquium was held on November 17, 2006 in Washington, D.C.&#13;
The sessions addressed recent developments at the three arbitration institutions; production&#13;
of documents and other evidentiary issues; new challenges regarding confidentiality; and&#13;
selected substantive issues arising from arbitration involving State parties. An interactive&#13;
luncheon session enabled colloquium participants to debate current issues in international&#13;
arbitration with an expert panel. ICSID also co-operated with the London Court&#13;
of International Arbitration to organize a symposium on international arbitration in&#13;
Washington, D.C, which was held on November 18, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the Centre organized, together with the Energy Charter Secretariat (ECS) and&#13;
the Arbitration Institute at the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC), a conference&#13;
on investment protection and the Energy Charter Treaty, which was hosted by ICSID on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
May 18, 2007 in Washington, D.C. The panel sessions addressed the negotiations of the&#13;
Energy CharterTreaty;the Energy CharterTreaty's investment dispute resolution provisions;&#13;
selected standards of treatment available under the Energy Charter Treaty; the interplay of&#13;
the Energy Charter Treaty with other treaties; and potential future developments in the&#13;

The administrative expenditures were, again, covered by the World Bank pursuant to the&#13;
Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements concluded between the Bank and ICSID in&#13;
February 1967, and by fee income and income from the sale of publications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is therefore not necessary to assess any excess expenditures on Contracting States pursuant&#13;
to Article 17 of the Convention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures relating to pending arbitration proceedings are borne by the parties in&#13;
accordance with ICSID's Administrative and Financial Regulations.&#13;

note 1 ­ oRgAniZAtion&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) was&#13;
established on October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of&#13;
investment disputes between States and nationals of other States.The Centre provides such&#13;
facilities for cases brought under the ICSID Convention,the ICSIDAdditional Facility Rules,&#13;
or where parties involved so request, under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations&#13;
Commission on InternationalTrade Law. On February 13, 1967, the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the Centre entered into Administrative&#13;
Arrangements which were effective as of the date of the establishment of the Centre.The&#13;
Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum) provides that, except to&#13;
the extent that the Centre may charge the parties to proceedings, for fees and expenses of&#13;
members of Conciliation Commissions,Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the Bank&#13;
shall provide facilities and services to the Centre, as described in Notes 2 and 4.&#13;

Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial statements&#13;
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in&#13;
the United States of America (US GAAP) and with International Financial Reporting&#13;
Standards (IFRS). Such financial statements are presented in accordance with Statement of&#13;
Financial Accounting Standards No. 117, Financial Statements of Not-For-Profit-Organizations&#13;
(SFAS No. 117). SFAS No. 117 requires that net assets are classified in accordance with&#13;
donor restrictions; however, there are no net assets as of June 30, 2007 and 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates:The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP&#13;
and IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported&#13;
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date&#13;
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during&#13;
the reporting period.Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;

Annex 6 (continued)&#13;
notes to finAnciAL stAtements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Change in Accounting Estimates: The nature of arbitration cases handled by the Centre&#13;
involves input from various arbitrators located in diverse countries who charge fees for their&#13;
service based on time spent on the cases.The determination of arbitrators'fees and expenses&#13;
incurred for ongoing cases involves an estimation process using information received from&#13;
the arbitrators on the unbilled time spent on the cases through the end of fiscal year.Due to&#13;
the difficulties in obtaining timely information from some arbitrators, the Centre revised its&#13;
estimation process for unbilled amounts for the ongoing cases during the current fiscal year.&#13;
Had the revised estimation process been applied in the previous year, additional charges of&#13;
$ 2,658,668 would have been recognized for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The&#13;
amount has been recognized in the current year in compliance with International&#13;
Accounting Standard 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and&#13;
SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Share in Pooled Cash and Investments: Amounts paid to the Centre, but not yet&#13;
disbursed, are managed by the Bank, which maintains a single investment portfolio (the&#13;
Pool) for all of the trust funds administered by the Bank, the International Development&#13;
Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee&#13;
Agency (the "World Bank Group"), and the funds of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank maintains the Pool assets separate and apart from the funds of the World Bank&#13;
Group.The Pool is subdivided into sub-portfolios to which allocations are made based on&#13;
fund-specific investment horizons, risk tolerances and other eligibility requirements set&#13;
by the Bank. Generally, the Pool is invested in liquid financial instruments such as money&#13;
market instruments, government and agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities, and&#13;
other high-grade bonds. Based on the Bank's investment strategy for trust funds, each sub-&#13;
portfolio is invested in a combination of these asset types consistent with the applicable risk&#13;
tolerance for that sub-portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank maintains the investments on a pooled accounting basis.The pooled investments&#13;
are reported at fair value. Share in Pooled Cash and Investments represents the Centre's pro-&#13;
rata share of the Pool's fair value at the end of the reporting period.The fair value is based on&#13;
market quotations, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are&#13;
based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.The corresponding proportionate&#13;
realized and unrealized gains/losses and interest income are accrued in the period in which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
they occur. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Centre changed its investment&#13;
strategy to invest its funds in a sub-portfolio of the Pooled Cash and Investments which&#13;
invests solely in cash and money market instruments with terms of three months or less.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Value of Services Provided by the Bank and In-kind Contributions: In accordance&#13;
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116, "Accounting for Contributions&#13;
Received and Contributions Made", the value of services provided by the Bank is determined&#13;
by the estimated fair value of these services and is recorded by the Centre as in-kind&#13;
contributions and also as expenses of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre including the following:&#13;
     (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
     (2) other administrative services and facilities, such as travel, communications, office&#13;
         accommodations, furniture, equipment, supplies and printing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Revenue Recognition from Arbitration Proceedings: The Centre's direct expenses&#13;
attributable to arbitration proceedings are borne by the parties in accordance with the Centre's&#13;
Administrative and Financial Regulations (Regulations).These direct expenses include the&#13;
fees and travel expenses of arbitrators and the costs associated with engaging meeting rooms&#13;
and supporting services for conducting proceedings. In accordance with these Regulations,&#13;
the ICSID Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance deposits with the Centre&#13;
from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses.Accordingly, the Centre recognizes&#13;
revenues from these exchange transactions during the period of and to the extent expenses&#13;
are incurred related to arbitration proceedings.The Centre also recognizes revenue for the&#13;
nonrefundable fees when collected from the parties to the arbitration proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Due from Parties to Arbitration Proceedings: Direct expenses incurred by arbitrators&#13;
in excess of advance payments made by the parties to the ongoing arbitration proceedings&#13;
are recognized as due from parties to arbitration proceedings and are callable in accordance&#13;
with the Centre's Regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investment of Undisbursed Advances from Parties and Refund of Surplus to&#13;
the Parties: The investment income accrues to the parties and can be used for expenses&#13;
related to arbitration proceedings.After the completion of an arbitration proceeding, if it is&#13;
determined that there is an excess of advances and investment income over expenditures for&#13;
the proceedings, the surplus shall be refunded to the parties in proportion to the amounts&#13;
advanced by each party to the Centre.&#13;

Accounting and Reporting Developments&#13;
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB): In June 2005, the IASB released&#13;
revised IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, by introducing the fair&#13;
value option to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2006.The&#13;
amendment did not have an impact on the Centre's financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The IASB issued IFRS 7, Financial Instrument: Disclosures, on 18 August 2005, with&#13;
complementary Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements ­ Capital&#13;
Disclosures. The Centre is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard which is&#13;
applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB): FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair&#13;
Value Measurements,in September 2006 that establishes a framework for measuring fair value&#13;
in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and expands disclosures requirements&#13;
about fair value measurements.The Centre is currently evaluating the impact of this new&#13;
statement that is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.&#13;

note 3 ­ finAnciAL RisK mAnAgement&#13;
The Pool is actively managed and invested in accordance with the investment strategy&#13;
established for all trust funds administered by the World Bank Group.The objectives of the&#13;
investment strategy are foremost to maintain adequate liquidity to meet foreseeable cash&#13;
flow needs and preserve capital and then to maximize investment returns.The Centre is&#13;
exposed to credit and liquidity risks.The risk management policies employed to manage&#13;
these risks are discussed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Credit risk ­ The risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an&#13;
obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.The Bank invests the pooled&#13;
assets in liquid instruments such as money market deposits, government and agency&#13;
obligations.The Bank is limited to investments with minimum credit ratings as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  n Money market deposits: issued or guaranteed by financial institutions whose senior&#13;
       debt securities are rated at least A-.&#13;
  nGovernment and agency obligations: issued or unconditionally guaranteed by&#13;
       government agencies rated at least AA- if denominated in a currency other than the&#13;
       home currency of the issuer, otherwise no rating is required. Obligations issued by an&#13;
       agency or instrumentality of a government, a multilateral organization or any other&#13;
       official entity require a minimum credit rating of AA-.&#13;
  n Mortgaged backed securities and corporate securities:minimum rating must be AAA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquidity risk ­ The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in raising liquid funds to&#13;
meet its commitments. ICSID regulations require parties to disputes to make advance&#13;
deposits with the Centre to meet anticipated expenses of arbitration proceedings.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In fiscal year 2007, the rapid expansion
            of the ICSID caseload continued unabated. With the
            registration of twenty-six new arbitration proceedings, the
            number of ICSID cases administered during the fiscal year
            reached a new record of one hundred and thirty. The growth
            of the caseload continued to be driven by treaty-based
            arbitration proceedings. At the end of the fiscal year, the
            number of the conciliation and arbitration cases registered
            with ICSID since its inception reached two hundred and
            thirty-six. In addition, ICSID provided administrative
            services in ten arbitration proceedings conducted under the
            Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
            International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and in an expert
            determination proceeding conducted under the provisions of
            the Indus Waters Treaty 1960. ICSID's membership
            increased to 144 Contracting States in the past year,
            following the ratification of the ICSID Convention by the
            Republic of Serbia.
