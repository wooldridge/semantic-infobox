PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. SECTOR AND PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
A. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
Geography, Population And Poverty&#13;
1.1    Most of the land area of Bangladesh is a low-lying, nearly flat, fertile, alluvial flood plain.&#13;
Three major river systems flow through the country into the Bay of Bengal. 80% of the annual&#13;
rainfall, which averages from 1,200 mm to 3,500 mm in different parts of the country, occurs during&#13;
the monsoon season and large areas are subject to 'normal' annual flooding from the monsoon and the&#13;
snow melt in the Himalayas, making Bangladesh one of the wettest areas in the world. In addition,&#13;
Bangladesh is prone to natural disasters including abnormal flooding and cyclones. These geographical&#13;
features make the construction and maintenance of transport infrastructure particularly difficult and&#13;
expensive, as land transport requires the building of higher embankments and many bridges and&#13;
drainage structures, and as river transport requires frequent dredging to remove silt and also faces&#13;
safety problems. The country also lacks adequate supply of natural stones, and therefore road works&#13;
have to depend on costly bricks baked out of clay for use as road materials.&#13;
1.2    With a population of about 120 million (1995), Bangladesh has a population density of about&#13;
813 persons per sq.km, making it the most densely populated country among non-city states. It is also&#13;
one of the poorest countries, with a per capita income of about US$240. Its Gross Domestic Product&#13;
(GDP) which grew at a low 1.8% per annum during the period 1980 to 1992, has recently increased at&#13;
a much higher rate of 4.4% during Fiscal Years (FY) 1992-95 rising to 4.7% in FY96; but this is yet&#13;
to make any significant dent on poverty. Poverty is more widespread in the rural areas and among&#13;
women; about half the rural population lives below the level of "absolute poverty" (defined as an&#13;
intake of 2,122 calories per person per day), and more than a quarter live below the "hard core" (with&#13;
per capita intake of less than 1,805 calories). Bangladesh remains primarily a rural society, with about&#13;
80% of the population living in rural areas.&#13;
Rural Economy&#13;
1.3    Bangladesh remains primarily a rural society, with about 80% of the population living in rural&#13;
areas. Agriculture is the major rural economic activity, contributing about 33% of GDP in 1995 (a&#13;
drop from 55% in 1970), providing about 69% of all employment and directly or indirectly producing&#13;
most of the country's exports.  About 66%  of the total land area of the country is cultivable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Agricultural land is intensively utilized, with no unsettled land left to exploit, and is fertile. The&#13;
cropping intensity, taking account of multiple cropping, is more than 170%. About 70% of the&#13;
agricultural GDP is from crop production, the remainder from forestry, livestock and fisheries.&#13;
1.4    There is a growing trend towards diversification of agriculture, which requires more timely&#13;
transportation and marketing, and yields higher income. The growth of agricultural production in&#13;
recent years is the result of increasing use of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, fertilizers and&#13;
irrigation, and a move to higher value crops. The current agricultural strategy of the Government of&#13;
Bangladesh (GOB) focuses on continuing development and diffusion of seed, fertilizer and water&#13;
technologies; increased crop diversification into higher value crops; a more competitive internal&#13;
marketing system with a greater role for the private sector; an improved rural transport infrastructure;&#13;
and improved access for rural people to sustainable employment opportunities.&#13;
1.5    As a predominantly rural country, rural infrastructure plays a vital role in supporting economic&#13;
growth. Studies in Bangladesh and elsewhere have shown a strong linkage between improved rural&#13;
access and market facilities, on the one hand, and increased agriculture production, employment, farm&#13;
and non-farm incomes, social development, and poverty alleviation. In Bangladesh, where poverty is&#13;
pervasive particularly in the rural areas where the bulk of the population lives, improving rural&#13;
infrastructure, which is in very poor condition at present, is an important strategy of GOB for&#13;
increasing and diversifying farm production, for raising incomes and living standards, and for reducing&#13;
poverty. Further, special emphasis is being given while designing rural infrastructure projects to&#13;
maximize employment and poverty impact by using labor-intensive technology wherever viable and by&#13;
targeting the poor for receiving income generating opportunities under the projects. Under recent and&#13;
ongoing projects, with considerable IDA and other donor support, GOB has made a good beginning in&#13;
strengthening infrastructure-related institutions and policies, in setting good quality standards, and in&#13;
making physical progress in improving infrastructure, but there is still a long way to go to meet the&#13;
massive investment needs in the sector.&#13;
B. THE RURAL TRANSPORT AND TRADING SYSTEM&#13;
1.6    The characteristics of high population density, high productivity of land, intensive cultivation,&#13;
small-scale farming and poverty-induced sale of even subsistence level production, search for&#13;
employment by the under-employed in farms and non-farm activities, and an active non-farm sector,&#13;
together generate intensive trading of goods and services in the rural areas and a high level of demand&#13;
for movement of goods and people; as a result the level of traffic in the rural areas of Bangladesh,&#13;
particularly in using the popular non-motorized forms of transport and the local "hats" or markets,&#13;
remains high. Although rural Bangladesh is poor, it has many characteristics which result in a highly&#13;
active rural cash economy in which mobility and trading are of crucial importance.&#13;
1.7    The main elements of Bangladesh's rural transport and trading infrastructure are: (1) rural&#13;
roads, which are, though extensive, mainly poor quality earth roads, requiring improved surfacing and&#13;
pavements on a selective basis, and interspersed with many gaps to be filled with drainage structures&#13;
for allowing uninterrupted traffic; most of these are seasonal roads, generally not usable in the rainy&#13;
season, creating considerable hardship for transportation during the monsoon period; and road&#13;
trangport with a strikingly dominant share of non-motorized transport (manually pedaled cycle-&#13;
rickshaws, passenger rickshaws and rickshaw vans, and to some extent animal -drawn carts) which&#13;
provide reasonably efficient rural transport suited to the small- parcel loads needed by most farmers,&#13;
and also provide employment to a large number of the rural poor. (2) inland water transport (IWT).&#13;
the traditional transport system of Bangladesh, which criss-crosses the country and carries a large part&#13;
of rural traffic through small country boats, but needs to be better integrated with road transport with&#13;
the provision of more landing facilities (river ghats) for country boats, while also requiring other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
improvements such as channel dredging, navigational safety aids etc; and (3) the rural market&#13;
network, with over 8000 rural markets or "hats' spread over the country, effectively constituting the&#13;
nerve center of the rural economy, facilitating the trading of all rural produce and most farm inputs&#13;
and consumer goods; most of these markets lack basic facilities (paved areas, sheds, clean water,&#13;
drainage, and garbage disposal facilities) and good transport access, resulting in unhygienic and&#13;
inefficient conditions for marketing produce. GOB has designated about 2,100 of these markets, based&#13;
on objective socio-economic criteria, as growth center markets for priority development. About 300&#13;
of these markets have been improved during the last ten years. These separate elements of the rural&#13;
transport and trading system are further discussed below.&#13;
1.8    At the national level, in 1992/93, the share of passenger traffic carried by roads is 75%, IWT&#13;
13% and railways is 12%: the share of freight-km traffic is 61% by roads, 32% by IWT and 7% by&#13;
railways. In the case of rural transport, road transport plays the major role in the rural movement of&#13;
people and goods, carrying over 60% of all traffic. Water transport holds the next largest share, and&#13;
particularly during the monsoon when many areas are flooded and the water level is high for easy&#13;
navigation. Rail transport is of only marginal significance in rural areas. More details on the level,&#13;
structure and pattem of rural traffic is presented in Document 1 (PID-1) in the Project Implementation&#13;
Documents (PIDs) (see Annex 4.1).&#13;
The Road Network&#13;
1.9   Responsibility for the total road network in the country is divided between the Roads and&#13;
Highways Department (RHD) of the Ministry of Communications, which focuses on the national and&#13;
regional roads, and the Local Govermnent Engineering Department (LGED) of the Ministry of Local&#13;
Govermment, Rural Development and Co-operatives (MLGRD&amp;C), which focuses on rural and feeder&#13;
roads. The RHD-managed network comprises:&#13;
National Highways:         Connecting  the  national capital Dhaka with  Divisional&#13;
headquarters and other important urban centers, ports, and&#13;
international highways.&#13;
Regional Highways:         Connecting regional (greater district) centers and District&#13;
headquarters with the national highways.&#13;
Feeder Roads Type A (FRA): Connecting Thana headquarters to the regional and national&#13;
(sub-regional roads)       highway system.&#13;
1.10   There are about 5,500 km of National and Regional Highways, predominantly bitumen-&#13;
surfaced, and about 10,000 km of FRAs mostly paved with bitumen or brick surface. There are many&#13;
unbridged river crossings on RHD roads but vehicle ferries serve these gaps. Improvement of the&#13;
management of the road network under RHD is being pursued currently under various  donor-&#13;
supported projects initiated by GOB, with the leading projects setting the framework agenda being the&#13;
IDA-supported Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Projects 1&amp;2, (Credits 1827-BD and 2638-BD)&#13;
which are currently making good progress.&#13;
1.11   The Local Government road network, i.e. the rural road network, most of it managed through&#13;
the LGED which is the technical body established to assist the local bodies in infrastructure planning,&#13;
construction and maintenance, comprises:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Feeder Roads Type B (FRB): Connecting growth centers (important rural markets described&#13;
below) to the regional road network (RHD roads) or to the&#13;
Thana  headquarters.   (Prescribed  Standards:  7.32  m&#13;
embankment crest width; 3.7 m carriageway width).&#13;
Rural Roads Type 1 (RR1):   Connecting local markets and Union headquarters with the&#13;
Thana headquarters or the 'road system' (i.e. FRBs or RHD&#13;
roads).  (Standards: Embankment crest width 4.87  m;&#13;
carriageway width 3.05 m).&#13;
Rural Roads Type 2 (RR2):   Connecting villages and farms to local markets and Union&#13;
headquarters. (Embankment crest width 3.72 m).&#13;
Rural Roads Type 3 (RR3):   Roads within villages. (Embankment crest width: 2.44 m).&#13;
These roads are intended to be managed by the local governments, but currently the local governments&#13;
are very weak (see para. 1.30), and therefore LGED plays a leading role in their improvement and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
1.12   Although classified as 'roads', most RR3s are footpaths within villages and should be strictly&#13;
excluded from the category of engineered roads, particularly for purposes of comparison with other&#13;
countries. Excluding RR3s (which are managed and maintained by the UPs), the length and surface&#13;
condition of the LGED road network is as follows:&#13;
Feeder Roads Type B (FRB): About 8,400 km of which 23% paved with bitumen or brick,&#13;
the remainder earthen.&#13;
Rural Roads Type 1 (RRI):   About 38,000 km, predominantly earthen.&#13;
Rural Roads Type 2 (RR2):   About 49,000 kIn, predominantly earthen.&#13;
LGED is currently revising the road classification in the light of the recent increase in the number of&#13;
classified growth center markets from 1400 to 2100 (which should also increase the number of roads&#13;
designated as growth -center connecting roads or FRBs).  In view of the importance of road&#13;
classification for investment prioritization, it was agreed during negotiations that GOB would review&#13;
with IDA by September 30. 1997. road classification revisions made by LGED. and would take into&#13;
account IDA's views while finalizing the revised classification.&#13;
1.13   While the length of the rural road network is impressive, their technical quality is very poor.&#13;
Most of the LGED roads were first built as earthen embankments using Food For Work Program&#13;
(FFW), with no funds for mechanical compaction or provision of structures so that, while providing an&#13;
important service to rural areas through partial use, a large part of the network is less than fully&#13;
functional as roads providing unbroken and all-season mobility. Roads selected as FRBs (growth -&#13;
center connecting) which have generally high present or potential traffic, require additional earthworks&#13;
for raising them above flood level, bridges and culverts to provide drainage, and surfacing for smooth&#13;
flow of motorized and non-motorized traffic. A particular problem on FRB, RR1 and RR2 roads is the&#13;
lack of cross-drainage structures (culverts and bridges).  Additional cross-drainage structures are&#13;
needed on many embankmnents to allow balancing of water levels during floods, and there are a large&#13;
number of 'gaps' in embankments that have never been bridged. Further, many of the existing&#13;
structures are in poor condition, or are damaged and require immediate repair. According to a recent&#13;
survey, even the higher priority Feeder-Roads Type B are in very poor condition; only 17% of them&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
are in "good" condition, and only 23% of them are paved roads the rest being mainly earthroads&#13;
without any hard surface. Of the lower category rural roads (RR1 and RR2) about 97% are poor&#13;
quality earth roads, with about 35,000 gaps needing bridging or culverts (PID-1 gives more details on&#13;
road conditions). These gaps force closure of roads in rainy season and block smooth flow of traffic in&#13;
fair season. While FRBs need expensive improvements to bring them to adequate standards, in the&#13;
case of RI and R2 rural roads (and R3 roads), which is extensive, the prime need is to construct these&#13;
missing drainage structures, since the level of traffic on these roads can generally function without&#13;
major earth works and other surface improvements. For the whole network, the focus should be and is&#13;
on selective improvement of existing roads, with no new road construction.&#13;
The Road Vehicle Fleet and Non-Motorized Transport&#13;
1.14   A characteristic of the road transport system  in Bangladesh is the co-existence, and&#13;
complementarity, of a growing mechanized vehicle fleet with large numbers of non-motorized transport&#13;
vehicles (NMT), and the overall larger share of rural traffic carried in NMT. The motor vehicle fleet&#13;
has grown quite rapidly, but non-motorized means of road transport remain important and the numbers&#13;
of cycle rickshaws and bicycles continue to grow. The motor vehicle fleet in 1994 comprised about&#13;
0.35 million vehicles, equivalent to one per 350 persons, and grew by 40% from 1989 to 1994, an&#13;
annual growth rate of 6.9%; the major growth was in numbers of auto-rickshaws (which doubled&#13;
over the five-year period) and motor cycles which now account for nearly half the total motorized fleet.&#13;
(PID-1 gives more details).&#13;
1.15   The role of non-motorized transport remains very important for movement of people and goods&#13;
in rural areas, complementing the expanding services provided by motor vehicles and reaching down to&#13;
lower levels of the road network. Because of the informal nature of the operations, detailed and&#13;
reliable official statistics are not available. The main rural non-motorized means of transport, the&#13;
estimated numbers in use and their functions are summarized below: (a) Bicycles: There are about&#13;
1.5 million, 80% of them in rural areas, and they are owned by nearly 8% of households. They are&#13;
used for personal transport, and to carry goods, including bulky loads, on rural roads and earthen&#13;
paths; (b) Cycle rickshaws, which consist of passenger rickshaws (or simply rickshaws) and rickshaw&#13;
vans are pedal tricycles fitted with a two seater, passenger-carrying body (though they are also often&#13;
used to carry goods). Rickshaw 'vans' are similar to passenger rickshaws but used mainly for goods&#13;
fitted with a general-purpose flat body that can carry goods and/or passengers, and more robust&#13;
wheels. The current stock of rural rickshaws is conservatively estimated at about 300,000. Rickshaws&#13;
are found throughout the country, but rickshaw vans are more common in the west and north-west, and&#13;
are increasing in number and progressively spreading eastward. Passenger rickshaws and rickshaw&#13;
vans operate on rural roads including unimproved earth roads, albeit often with difficulty. They&#13;
provide the most extensive transport services in rural areas, and reach further down the system than&#13;
motorized vehicles. Rickshaw vans are better adapted to movement of both goods and people, and&#13;
provide a cheaper service for passengers. Rural rickshaw pulling provides employment for about&#13;
400,000 poor men. According to a recent survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, rickshaw's&#13;
share in yearly value addition is 30 percent of the transport sector's total contribution to the GDP; and&#13;
(c) Bullock carts: There are over 600,000 bullock carts, though there is evidence that numbers are&#13;
declining. They are concentrated in the higher, drier regions of the west and north-west. They tend to&#13;
be owned by larger farmers, and are used to move agricultural cargoes between the home and the fields&#13;
and on-road, and are also operated for-hire. The large diameter wheels with narrow width steal rims&#13;
damage paved roads at a faster rate. Recent studies show (see para. 1.49, PID-1) that both motorized&#13;
and non-motorized vehicles increased by about over 140% following road improvement.&#13;
1.16   The road designs under ongoing projects, and even more so under the proposed RRMIMP-2,&#13;
take into account the special needs of the non-motorized traffic, in providing smoother riding surface,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
hard shoulders (so that passenger rickshaws, rickshaw-vans and bicycles can easily give way to&#13;
motorized traffic to pass, without falling into a lower level shoulder), and in the provision of parking&#13;
and access in markets, as well as road safety training for operators.  The proposed project also&#13;
includes a pilot component to help improve the design of the NMT vehicles in use with a view to&#13;
improve their safety, ridability and efficiency.&#13;
The Water Transport System&#13;
1.17   Bangladesh has more than 24,000 km of perennially and seasonally navigable waterways.&#13;
Historically, the main means of transport was by non-mechanized, wooden country boats. The&#13;
Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) is responsible for the conservancy and&#13;
maintenance of some 6,000 km of waterway; for important inland ports, launch facilities and ferries;&#13;
and for the regulation of some 4,500 registered vessels. Below this level the informal, rural inland&#13;
water transport sector is much more extensive, comprising of many thousands of kilometers of smaller&#13;
waterways; many river jetties/ghats (boat landing, unloading and loading sites), though lacking basic,&#13;
safe, facilities; and rural ferry, passenger and cargo transport services provided by country boats.&#13;
1.18   The number of country boats is variously estimated at between 730,000 and 1.8 million&#13;
including large numbers of small, domestic boats. Of most significance are the 200,000 cargo and&#13;
100,000 passenger boats operating commercially on inland waterways. The operation of country boats&#13;
has suffered from siltation of some waterways; creation of barriers on some navigation channels&#13;
through construction of road embankment and low-level bridges; a perception that they are unreliable&#13;
and insecure; and increasing competition from the developing rural road transport system. However in&#13;
the 1980s there was a rapid process of mechanization of commercial boats, using low-cost diesel&#13;
engines imported to drive irrigation pumps - about 80% of commercial boats are now mechanized.&#13;
This has revived the country boat sector, making the boats faster, more reliable, more secure, and&#13;
more competitive with road transport. Efforts have also been made to increase the visibility and&#13;
'legitimacy' of the country boat sector through the formation of the Bangladesh Country Boat Owners&#13;
Association (BCBOA).&#13;
1.19   An ongoing IDA-supported IWT project (Credit No. 2232-BD) is currently addressing major&#13;
issues in institutional reforms and strengthening, training, navigation safety equipment and facilities,&#13;
dredging of river channels, and river port improvements, though its main focus is on the "formal"&#13;
sector of classified navigation channels and ports under the control of BIWTA, referred above. The&#13;
proposed RRMIMP-2 would provide improved facilities in many river ghats in the project area to serve&#13;
the informal boats sector and also provide support to BCBOA for assisting the country boat sector&#13;
through better information sharing and safety education. (See paras. 2.26 and 2.32).&#13;
The Rural Market Network&#13;
1.20   Bangladesh has an extensive network of about 8,000 rural markets, or 'hats', comprising:&#13;
*     6,000 primary markets, used primarily by farmers selling surplus produce to local&#13;
consumers and local traders.&#13;
*      1,500 local assembly markets, used by farmers and local traders exchanging with&#13;
intermediary traders who move agricultural produce up to higher levels of the&#13;
marketing system, and for the sale of foodstuffs, agricultural inputs and retail goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
*     about 450 secondary markets, typically serving a Thana.  They are used by&#13;
intermediary traders exchanging with large buyers, and are focal points for wholesale&#13;
and retail sale of agricultural and non-agricultural goods and services.&#13;
1.21   Complex, multi-stage trading systems prevail in rural Bangladesh for the accumulation and&#13;
evacuation of surplus agricultural produce and the distribution of 'imported' goods. Crops and other&#13;
goods change hands several times between producer and final consumer, and different categories of&#13;
trader are present at different levels of the marketing system. The more important markets are&#13;
characterized by the presence of permanent and semi-permanent structures including shops, storage&#13;
facilities, crop processing enterprises, banks and post offices. Many of the more important markets are&#13;
centers for the trading of a wide variety of agricultural produce and other goods, but some focus on the&#13;
exchange of large quantities of particular commodities such as rice, cattle, or locally-produced cloth.&#13;
1.22  In 1984 the GOB adopted a policy of identifying selected important markets as growth centers,&#13;
to be focal points for rural development where investments in rural economic and social infrastructure&#13;
should be concentrated (see para. 1.43). 1,408 rural local assembly and secondary markets were&#13;
designated as growth centers by the Planning Commission in 1984 selected with participation by the&#13;
local authorities based on a set of guidelines that included the revenue potential, trading volume,&#13;
area/population served, and a minimum distance between neighboring growth centers. In 1994 an&#13;
additional 700 markets were selected by the Planning Commission, reflecting population growth and&#13;
regional growth, giving a current total of about 2,100 growth centers. Each Thana has at least three&#13;
growth centers, some more; there is about one growth center for every two Union Parishads.&#13;
Market Organization and leasing&#13;
1.23   The markets (market facilities for public use) are managed by the Union Parishads under which&#13;
they are located, through Union Market Management Committee (UMMC) which is responsible for&#13;
operation and maintenance. (Annex 1.1 gives more details related to this section). The UMMC has&#13;
members from local market users, from the UP, and Thana level officials. Most market operations are&#13;
on designated market days (about two days in a week), when the markets operate at the busiest level,&#13;
or in some cases, on all days. The market vendors (mostly small farmers and poor traders) use&#13;
markets on short-term daily basis, and permanent shops are not allowed on the public market area,&#13;
though many permanent private shops develop and prosper around these public market centers. Each&#13;
market is leased out, for operations and collection of user charges from vendors, to the highest bidder&#13;
based on a competitive sealed tender system. The unit market rates or market tariff (per bag, basket,&#13;
or weight of goods sold) are fixed by Government at a uniform level for all markets in a District; these&#13;
tariff are increased from time to time. Developed markets earn more revenue with the increase of&#13;
turnover of goods transacted, as these markets attract more vendors and customers. The lease-holder&#13;
is responsible for regular cleaning of the market, while the UMMC is responsible for supervision of&#13;
operations by the lease-holder, and for regular maintenance and development of the market.&#13;
1.24   The market lease amount is distributed among UP, Thana Development and Coordination&#13;
Committee (TDCC, see para. 1.30), and GOB according to a prescribed formula. 15% of the lease&#13;
value is allocated for maintenance to the UMCC and another 10 % to the Thana for development and&#13;
emergency repairs after possible floods etc. (see Attachment 4, Annex 1.1). These provisions fully&#13;
cover operations and maintenance needs to keep the developed markets functioning on a sustainable&#13;
basis. Data from markets developed under RRMIMP-1 show that on an average, market improvements&#13;
of a medium-size market cost about Taka 2.4 million (about US$60,000); an average medium-size&#13;
developed market yields a lease revenue of about Taka 200,000 and needs an estimated Taka 18,000&#13;
for regular maintenance. The balance of the lease revenue, reflecting a positive financial return on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
investment, goes to the UP, TDCC and GOB for use in other development works. A study of 28&#13;
markets completed under RRMIMP-1 shows a wide variety of lease income levels: The average lease&#13;
income for all of them was Taka 850,000, with the following break-up: for the 9 large markets, the&#13;
average lease income was Taka 2,300,000; for the 10 medium markets, it was Taka 208,000, and for&#13;
the 9 very small markets (which also cost less), the average was Taka 64,000. As discussed below,&#13;
there is scope for increasing lease income by improving the leasing processes.&#13;
1.25   The market development, which provides basic facilities for hygiene and cleanliness (for&#13;
slaughter of animals for sale of meat, for drainage, garbage disposal, clean water, and sale of food&#13;
produce and perishable goods under sheds on a paved platform rather than on muddy ground) is a&#13;
valuable social investment in public health considerably benefiting the mostly poor traders and vendors&#13;
who use the markets. UPs and GOB do not favor the idea of a higher tariff level (tariff per unit of&#13;
quantity sold, such as per basket, bag, etc.), as this may drive the vendors to use unauthorized,&#13;
undeveloped and unhygienic locations along roadside, losing revenue for UPs and health benefits for&#13;
the public; they point out that higher revenue from increased turn-over, using the same tariff level&#13;
would be adequate for cost recovery, particularly since a 30-40% increase has been observed in lease&#13;
values after development of markets due to increased turnover. Moreover, the present system allows&#13;
full recovery of operation and maintenance costs, with minor exceptions. Field Studies also show that&#13;
the lease holders actually get much higher revenue (often about 100% more) than the bid lease value,&#13;
due to possible collusiveness in the bidding process; and the lease holders often charge more than the&#13;
fixed unit tariff from the poor vendors. With a view to increase revenue from the markets for use in&#13;
other development works, without hurting the poor vendors who are the main market users, the project&#13;
proposes measures to increase transparency and competition in the bidding process to increase lease&#13;
value by squeezing the surplus profit made by the lease holder (see para. 1.35); there will be also more&#13;
user participation in managing the markets better.&#13;
C. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS&#13;
The Administrative Structure&#13;
1.26   Bangladesh is divided administratively into six Divisions (Dhaka, Barisal, Chittagong, Khulna,&#13;
Rajshahi and the newly created Sylhet Division) plus four Metropolitan urban areas (Dhaka,&#13;
Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi). The Divisions are divided into Districts and then into Thanas (and&#13;
Pourashavas or Municipalities for urban localities within the Districts), Unions and Villages. The&#13;
characteristics of the rural administrative structure are summarized as follows:&#13;
64 Districts (also         average population, 1.8 million&#13;
known as Zilas):           average land area, 2,300 sq.km&#13;
460 Thanas (formerly       average population, 250,000&#13;
known as Upazilas):        average land area, 320 sq.km&#13;
4,451 Unions:              average population, 25,000&#13;
average land area, 33 sq.km&#13;
About                      average population, 1,350&#13;
85,000 Villages:           average land area, 1.75 sq.km&#13;
1.27   At central government level the Planning Commission develops rural infrastructure policies&#13;
and strategic plans. The plan period of the Fourth Five Year Plan (1991-1995) has now ended. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
place of Five Year Plans, the Planning Commission has prepared a longer-term fifteen year Perspective&#13;
Development Plan which is now under review by the Government. This Perspective Plan emphasizes a&#13;
participatory approach to development, and there has been considerable participation from local bodies&#13;
and local interests in its preparation. The Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and&#13;
Cooperatives (MLGRD&amp;C) is responsible for rural development and for managing and supervising the&#13;
local government system.  It comprises the Local Government Division (LGD) and the Rural&#13;
Development Division (RDD). The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), which is an&#13;
agency of the LGD, and has a decentralized set up, plays the most important role in rural infrastructure&#13;
development in coordination with the local government bodies.&#13;
1.28   Agencies and departments of central government are strongly represented at Divisional,&#13;
District and/or Thana level. In addition each Division has a Divisional Commissioner, each District a&#13;
Deputy Commissioner (DC), and each Thana a Thana Nirbahi Officer (TNO), all employees of central&#13;
government. Thana is the lowest level where central government offices operate.&#13;
Local Government Bodies&#13;
1.29   When the ongoing RRMIMP-1 project was approved by IDA in 1988, local government in&#13;
Bangladesh had an elected body at the level of the Thana (called the Upazilla Parishad) which had&#13;
significant responsibilities in many areas of development and social services, including the maintenance&#13;
and partly development of rural infrastructure, financed by funding allocated to them from central&#13;
Government and revenue raised on their own. The Union Parishads (about ten in each Thana) were&#13;
the elected bodies which operated at the Union level, below the Upazilla Parishads. The RRMIMP-1&#13;
project had proposed many measures to further improve the operation of the Upazilla Parishads with&#13;
regard to rural infrastructure.&#13;
1.30   The system of local government changed radically with a legislation passed in 1991 which&#13;
abolished the Upazila (thana) Parishads. This also made the local government structure much weaker&#13;
than before. The only level of elected local government is now the level of the Union (group of about&#13;
twenty villages). The Union Parishad (Council) has existed in one forn or another in Bangladesh since&#13;
the 19th century. Union Parishads (UP) have now been given increased powers of local revenue&#13;
generation and responsibilities for rural development activities. They are responsible for certain small&#13;
infrastructure projects, for maintenance of Rural Roads (except important RR1s for which LGED takes&#13;
responsibility) and, through the Union Market Management Committees (UMMC) for operation and&#13;
maintenance of markets. The Upazila Parishads have been partially replaced by the establishment of&#13;
Thana Development Co-ordination Committees (TDCCs). The Chairmen of each Union Parishad&#13;
constitute the voting membership of the TDCC; Thana-level officials of central government agencies,&#13;
including the LGED Thana Engineer, sit on the TDCC as non-voting members, the TNO acts as&#13;
secretary and local Members of Parliament acts as advisors. The TDCCs are essentially concerned&#13;
with co-ordination and monitoring of development project activities within the Thana. More details of&#13;
the local government system are given in Annex 1. 1.&#13;
1.31   Each UP has ten elected members, (nine ward members plus Chairman) and three women&#13;
members elected by the ward members. At present the Union Parishads are weak, and they are still in&#13;
the process of adapting their new responsibilities under the revised local government system. The&#13;
physical area of each UP is very small (about 30 sq. km. and a population of about 25,000), which&#13;
limits their involvement in planning of certain types of infrastructure development. They have very&#13;
limited executive staff capacity (one Union Secretary), so that the work of the UP must be done by its&#13;
elected members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
1.32   UPs are also financially weak, their average annual income, though widely varying among&#13;
them, being only about US$16,000 equivalent, from all sources: from directly raised revenue, share of&#13;
market leases, and the annual "Block Grant" from central government which is allocated based on&#13;
some socio-economic criteria for spending under pre-fixed guidelines. UPs have significant local&#13;
revenue raising powers but at present collection performance is very poor, averaging only about Taka&#13;
5 per adult per annum. A proportion of the revenue from the annual leasing of smaller markets is&#13;
channeled directly to the UPs, while a proportion of that from larger markets is channeled to the&#13;
TDCC to be allocated to development activities in the Unions. At present the major source of revenue&#13;
for development activities is the GOB Annual Development Program (ADP) Block Grant for Union&#13;
and Thana Development. This amounts to an average of Taka 0.45 million per Union in FY95/96 and&#13;
is channeled through the TDCC so that decisions over its allocation to development projects are made&#13;
by the UP Chairmen; 25-60% of the Block Grant is earmarked for work on roads, culverts and bridges&#13;
in the Unions. (Annex 1.1 gives more details on the financial status and revenue distribution).&#13;
1.33   Union Parishads are already involved in the planning and implementation of infrastructure&#13;
development activities including the LGED/CARE RMP, to which they contribute 10% of the cost; the&#13;
LGED/CARE RRNC project, to which they contribute 10% of the cost of cross-drainage structures;&#13;
the LGED/WFP GCCR program; and GOB food for work schemes (see paras. 1.37 and 1.38). The&#13;
powers of the UPs to implement infrastructure projects are limited by law. Except for earthworks and&#13;
tree plantation they can only contract for works up to Taka 50,000 in value. Infrastructure works in&#13;
excess of this value, including those financed from the Block Grant, are tendered through a Thana&#13;
Tender Committee (on which the concerned UP Chairman sits), contracts are let by the LGED Thana&#13;
Engineer, and the funds are managed by the TNO and the Thana Engineer. This system gives good&#13;
control and accountability for project funds.&#13;
1.34   There is considerable potential to strengthen the capability of the Union Parishads and related&#13;
bodies. GOB and LGED have recently taken some measures to increase local participation within the&#13;
existing local government framework and LGED has taken leadership to help increase their planning&#13;
capability through the introduction of the Union Plan Book. Much more needs to be done to develop&#13;
their capacity for effective operation and maintenance of markets and ghats; the proposed project&#13;
would assist in this regard. The most important issue is to increase the financial resources of the&#13;
Union Parishads, so that they can hire staff to take on specific tasks, and mobilize funds for&#13;
improvement and maintenance of local-level infrastructure. The proposed project addresses this issue,&#13;
and several measures have been identified to increase local financial resources.&#13;
1.35   One of the main financial issues affecting the project would be that the UPs, which are the&#13;
lowest level elected Government in the country have a weak financial basis, and are unable to find&#13;
adequate funding for maintaining the infrastructure under their jurisdiction on a sustainable basis and&#13;
for constructing essential drainage structures to fill gaps on their roads. A related issue is the poor&#13;
arrangements for revenue collection from growth center markets and an inadequate distribution system&#13;
of the market lease revenue which gives a very low share of income to the UPs and does not leave&#13;
enough incentives for UPs to improve their management. In dealing with these issues, the project&#13;
includes two sets of actions: First, up-front actions completed before Board presentation of the project;&#13;
second, follow-up measures within about 24 months after Board presentation in the light of future&#13;
studies funded under the project.&#13;
(a)    The up-front actions (all of these have been completed by October 1996) are the&#13;
following: (i) Government reduced its share of market lease revenue from the present&#13;
35% to 25% and allowed the additional 10% to go directly to the UPs (this may add&#13;
average US$500 equivalent, to UP annual revenue); (ii) Government allocated half of&#13;
the land-transfer-tax revenue going now to the Zila Parishad (district), to the UPs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
generating this revenue, compared to none at present (average allocation from this&#13;
source is currently about 10 million Taka per district). Therefore, average increase in&#13;
UP revenue from half of this reallocation will be about US$1,800 equivalent). Since&#13;
land value increases with improved rural infrastructure, this is a good way of levying&#13;
user charges for maintenance; (iii) Government increased the lease value threshold for&#13;
UP-managed markets from the current value of Taka 50,000 to Taka 100,000, keeping&#13;
the present 40% allocation of lease revenue to the UPs; and (iv) More transparent&#13;
procedures and wide based competition have been introduced to reduce collusion in&#13;
market leasing, with better information sharing arrangements, publicity arrangements,&#13;
tendering done by district level agencies and appropriate user participation under&#13;
agreed guidelines. This should apply at least to the developed markets in the project&#13;
area. Measures (i) to (iii) may increase the average UP income by about 15% from its&#13;
present level of about US$16,000 equivalent. The impact of these measures on central&#13;
Government's revenue will be negligible (a reduction of about 0.3% from the present&#13;
annual revenue of Taka 141 billion.&#13;
(b)   In addition to above interim measures, a study on improving revenue mobilization by&#13;
UPs (para. 2.32) including better system for ghats and markets management and&#13;
leasing should be completed by about December 1997.  It was agreed during&#13;
negotiations that GOB would complete the study on UPs Financial Resource&#13;
Mobilization by December 31. 1997 and, in consultation with IDA. prepare a plan of&#13;
action based upon the study results, and carry it out by December 31. 1998.&#13;
The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) - (The project implementation agency)&#13;
1.36   LGED is currently one of the remarkably successful organizations in the Government sector in&#13;
Bangladesh. LGED originated as a small cell in the LGD in the late 1970s. It has evolved, through&#13;
the formation of the Works Program Wing in 1982 and of the Local Government Engineering Bureau&#13;
in 1984 (which was upgraded to a Department in 1992), into a large and dynamic engineering agency.&#13;
LGED has its headquarters in Dhaka, and its infrastructure works are executed though fully established&#13;
offices in each of the 64 Districts, each headed by an Executive Engineer (XEN), and in each of the&#13;
460 Thanas, each headed by a Thana Engineer (TE). LGED has a decentralized set-up, with an&#13;
engineering staff of about 700, and works closely with UPs and TDCCs, and more recently has been&#13;
trying to build in more community participation in its operations. Almost all works are contracted out&#13;
to private contractors and in the case of some small works to worker groups, with LGED providing&#13;
overall management and supervision on behalf of central and local governments.  The present&#13;
organization structure of LGED, and its staffing, is in Annex 1.2.&#13;
1.37  In accordance with the 1984 Strategy for Rural Developments Projects LGED is implementing&#13;
a portfolio of donor-supported RDPs in different regions of the country (see Annex 1.3, Table 1),&#13;
primarily concerned with improvement of the rural road and market network. Up to end FY1994/95,&#13;
some 2,300km of FRB have been improved, about 33,000 running metres of bridges and culverts&#13;
constructed, and about 300 growth center markets improved, under these projects.&#13;
1.38   The RDPs are complemented by the following food-aided rural development projects, also&#13;
implemented through LGED:&#13;
*  The WFP-supported growth center Connecting Roads Program (GCCR) which constructs&#13;
improved FRB earthen embankments (about 4,000km to date) and small FRB cross-&#13;
drainage structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
*   A nationwide medium and large bridges construction program financed by UNSAID PL-&#13;
480 monetized food-aid.&#13;
*   The LGED/CARE Road Maintenance Project (RMP), recently transferred from  the&#13;
Ministry of Relief. This national program uses monetized CIDA food-aid to support the&#13;
maintenance of Rural Roads by teams of assetless women.&#13;
*   The Rural Road Network Component (RRNC) of the USAID-supported Integrated Food&#13;
for Development (IFFD) program. This national program, implemented in partnership&#13;
with CARE, supports earthworks improvements and the construction of small cross-&#13;
drainage structures on Rural Roads,&#13;
*   The EC-supported Integrated Food-Assisted Rural Development Project (IFADEP).&#13;
LGED implements the IFADEP component concerned with improvement of earthern&#13;
growth center Connecting Roads.&#13;
1.39   The rural road and market related infrastructure development and maintenance projects under&#13;
the responsibility of LGED, as listed in Annex 1.3. Tables 1 and 2, have a total estimated cost of&#13;
about US$1.3 billion with estimated expenditure (foreign and local) in FY95/96 of about US$180&#13;
million. This excludes allocations for rural road maintenance (US$16.3 million in 1995/96) also&#13;
handled through LGED.&#13;
1.40   LGED's broader infrastructure responsibilities include small-scale water resources, irrigation&#13;
and flood control, rural water supply and sanitation, urban infrastructure development in secondary&#13;
and rural towns, and construction of cyclone shelters and primary schools. LGED contributes to the&#13;
generation of productive employment by emphasizing the use of labor-intensive methods for&#13;
construction and maintenance works wherever appropriate, including the employment of labor groups&#13;
known as Labor Contracting Societies (LCS, organized by workers as contracting firms for small&#13;
works).&#13;
1.41   Many of the donor-supported projects in LGED have technical assistance inputs which aim to&#13;
develop planning, implementation and management capability.   The SIDA/NORAD  financed&#13;
Institutional Support Project (ISP) provides long-term support focusing on physical planning and&#13;
mapping, technical design and management, and training. The proposed third phase of ISP (1996-&#13;
2000) was appraised in late 1995. As part of RDP-18 the ADB is financing long-term technical&#13;
assistance on maintenance management, training, and the Management Capability Strengthening Study&#13;
(MANCAPS) for LGED. The institutional components for strengthening LGED proposed under&#13;
RRMIMP-2 are designed in close coordination with these efforts by SID/NORAD, ADB and other&#13;
agencies.&#13;
1.42   LGED is recognized by all funding agencies as efficient in managing and implementing&#13;
projects in co-ordination with donors. The first phase of MANCAPS has produced an action plan for&#13;
the management strengthening of LGED1 which concludes that the organization is effective and&#13;
successful, and is characterized by team work, field orientation, dynamic leadership and hard work.&#13;
However, following a period of rapid growth LGED personnel are now overloaded with work, and&#13;
this has led to a number of ad hoc organizational arrangements. As LGED reaches maturity and enters&#13;
a new phase of development it is important to consolidate and strengthen the organization. MANCAPS&#13;
I          Draft Action Plan - Directions in Management Development of LGED. MANCAPS, March&#13;
1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
therefore recommends a comprehensive re-organization of LGED including a new level of management&#13;
between the Districts and headquarters so as to reduce the present span of control under which about&#13;
80 officials report directly to the Chief Engineer; strengthening of the headquarters management&#13;
structure; the integration of ISP functions into the established structure including the creation of a&#13;
Design Cell; and the strengthening of planning, monitoring and evaluation, management information&#13;
systems (MIS) functions. The MANCAPS recommendations, and the proposed organization structure,&#13;
are in Annex 1.2. The RRMIMP-2 Appraisal Mission agreed with many of the MANCAPS&#13;
recommendations and, in co-ordination with inputs from other financing agencies and GOB, a number&#13;
of them will be implemented and financed under the project in order to contribute to the management&#13;
strengthening of LGED. In addition, the project would also reinforce LGED's ongoing efforts in&#13;
making it a participatory organization with active involvement of project beneficiaries, by&#13;
incorporating participation specialists and training in its organization (see paragraphs 2.33 and 3.1).&#13;
D. RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY&#13;
1.43   The Government has followed a consistent strategy in recent years to improve rural&#13;
infrastructure on a selective basis while also improving its highway network, with emphasis on better&#13;
integration of the transport sector investments and policy, and better coordination among transport&#13;
agencies, such as RHD and LGED. GOB published a "Rural Development Strategy" in 1984, which&#13;
enunciated a strategy based on focusing resources to develop "growth centers" with maximum potential&#13;
for growth  in rural areas, selected on the basis of clearly defined criteria of socio-economic&#13;
importance and development potential; this also defined Government's rural infrastructure strategy,&#13;
directed to help growth center development as its main focus. The rural infrastructure strategy as&#13;
defined in the Five Year Plans, in line with the above Rural Development Strategy, has been to focus&#13;
on improving: (a) Type B feeder roads (FRBs) (also called growth - center- connecting roads) which,&#13;
by definition, connect selected "growth centers" in sub-districts (Thana) to thana headquarters or the&#13;
nearest all-weather road; there are 2100 "growth centers" in the country; (b) selected other rural roads&#13;
(Rl, R2), which connect villages with growth centers or feeder roads; (c) provision of drainage&#13;
structures (culverts/bridges) on important rural roads; and (d) market structures and facilities in the&#13;
growth centers. The "growth center connecting roads" is a good concept in selectivity, this being&#13;
treated as the core of rural roads; though classified as FRBs, they are mostly earth roads and need&#13;
upgrading into reasonable minimum quality standards to provide expected service. Similarly, the&#13;
selected growth center markets form a core group of high priority, from among about 8,000 local&#13;
markets. The emphasis has been on improving existing facilities, with minimal new construction,&#13;
particularly in the case of roads. In the light of a recent review of the working of this strategy which&#13;
basically endorsed its continuation (see para. 1.45 below) the Government is now continuing with this&#13;
rural infrastructure strategy into the future, through the Perspective Development Plan for the Country&#13;
(1995-2010) recently formulated by the National Planning Commission.&#13;
1.44   Recent Progress: The 1984 Strategy Paper envisaged a 10-year infrastructure improvement&#13;
program (1985-1995) with construction/upgrading of 6,400 km of FRBs, 9,600 km of rural roads,&#13;
132,000 running meters of culverts/bridges, and 1,400 markets. This infrastructure program is being&#13;
implemented mainly through some eight different ongoing projects (and some completed projects)&#13;
(called Rural Development Projects - RDPs, please see Annex 1.3. Tables 1 and 2. listing ongoing&#13;
RDPs), spread over the country, all with financial assistance from aid-agencies (including IDA, and&#13;
ADB: IDA has an ongoing project, this proposed one being a follow-up project; ADB has completed&#13;
one project, and has recently launched a second project). Many of these ongoing projects are regional&#13;
projects focusing on different regions, while two are national projects (one funding rural bridges in the&#13;
country, financed by USAID, and another, funded by Swedish aid, providing technical assistance and&#13;
institutional support to LGED for improving planning and implementation of rural road programs in&#13;
coordination with the local Government agencies.  Separate regional projects allow  separate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
procurement and other rules applicable to different funding agencies, make projects more manageable,&#13;
and the projects are well-coordinated by the GOB and LGED and fit into national and regional&#13;
priorities, as shown by the results of a recent review (see para. below). LGED has five additional&#13;
national programs fully funded by Government, focusing on rural infrastructure development. The&#13;
total cost of all these ongoing projects is about US$1,300 million equivalent, of which infrastructure&#13;
components (roads and markets and related technical assistance) are about US$1,100 million&#13;
equivalent. LGED is recognized by all funding agencies as efficient and competent in managing these&#13;
projects. These projects are progressing satisfactorily and have already produced good impact on the&#13;
rural areas where they serve, as demonstrated by impact studies. However, in terms of physical&#13;
progress, these projects have collectively been able to achieve so far only about 30% of national targets&#13;
for 1995 fixed 10 years ago, due to (1) the ambitious nature of these targets which were not matched&#13;
by resources and projects needed to meet them, and (2) the slow start of many projects due to the&#13;
learning process in building up institutional and contractor capacity for efficient implementation. This&#13;
has left huge unmet demands for improvement, further increased by population growth. This, and the&#13;
generally poor condition of rural infrastructure in the country, underline the need to continue efforts at&#13;
a faster pace.&#13;
1.45   A review of the GOB's rural infrastructure strategv and performance was recently undertaken&#13;
jointly by IDA, LGED and GOB agencies, in consultation with other domestic stakeholders and&#13;
cofinanciers (see Bangladesh Rural Infrastructure Strategy Study by IDA/LGED, February 1996; BD-&#13;
SR-15732). The main conclusion of the review is that the current strategy's growth center approach&#13;
remains valid and no major changes are required; only some readjustments or 'fine tuning' may be&#13;
justified in the light of the experience acquired by the different Rural Development Projects, as&#13;
discussed below: Targets will have to be reset after the recent increase from 1400 to 2100 growth&#13;
centers; and some minor readjustments will be needed in the spatial distribution of infrastructure&#13;
investments to be fully in line with agricultural production and potential. The review recommends,&#13;
further, to put more emphasis on user/community participation in planning, implementation and&#13;
monitoring and in funding; improved use of local resources such as local materials and the use of labor&#13;
based techniques; coordination in the use of complementary modes of transportation, specifically&#13;
waterways; increasing the role of the private sector, strengthening contractor capacity, and use of&#13;
bigger contracts (compared to average 2-3 km contracts now); and, institutional strengthening of&#13;
LGED and its wide network at local levels with a greater orientation towards community participation.&#13;
The review emphasizes greater selectivity in investments in keeping with priority needs, and much&#13;
greater emphasis on building and funding a sustainable maintenance system. The study has established&#13;
that rural infrastructure investments have produced significant impact and that "improved roads and&#13;
markets" are strongly correlated with higher agricultural production. A spatial analysis (presented in&#13;
the report) has demonstrated that past investment in rural roads and markets through the growth -center&#13;
based strategy has responded well to the regional location of demand for services, demonstrating that&#13;
the strategy has led to rational distribution of rural road investments.&#13;
1.46   The strategy study also estimates that larger investment than in the past decade and the current&#13;
annual level would be needed to meet essential needs of estimated demand for improved infrastructure.&#13;
Currently, Bangladesh spends about 5.5% of its development budget (based on foreign and local&#13;
resources) on rural roads and markets development (about 5.5 billion Taka; see Annex 1.3). The&#13;
strategy study notes that to achieve a modest target of meeting about 70% of the current infrastructure&#13;
improvement needs over the next 10 years, a total of Taka 63 billion would be needed (about US$1.5&#13;
billion in 1995 prices), indicating an annual development expenditure of about Taka 16.3 billion (about&#13;
US$155 million) for the next 10 years. In addition, maintenance cost will have to go up from the&#13;
present requirement of 1,300 million Taka to about 2,900 million Taka by year 2006.  Using&#13;
cumulative annual average maintenance for the next five years, these figures indicate an annual&#13;
resource requirement of about 8.1 billion Taka (6.3 billion Taka for development and 1.8 billion Taka&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
for average annual maintenance) over the next five years, followed by similar development and more&#13;
maintenance funding in the subsequent 5 years, for reaching the goal of improving 70% of the existing&#13;
network by year 2005. Resources available at present are about 6.8 billion annually (54% foreign,&#13;
46% domestic) (Annex 1.3). This underlines the need for raising more resources, particularly from&#13;
domestic resources.&#13;
1.47   GOB has accepted in principle the changes suggested above (para. 1.45) in future infrastructure&#13;
strategy, and the proposed project, in particular, is designed on the basis of the findings of the above&#13;
strategy review.&#13;
E. MAINTENANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
1.48   To ensure sustainability of the rural infrastructure being improved, it is important to build up a&#13;
good maintenance system and a viable funding mechanism based on local resources, particularly, in&#13;
view of the increased maintenance needs estimated above (para. 1.45).   GOB has accepted this&#13;
principle and has recently allocated adequate funds for maintenance. The LGED has set up a national&#13;
maintenance system but this system needs to be made operationally more efficient, which is sought to&#13;
be done through the proposed project. Currently funds for maintenance of most rural roads and&#13;
highways come from domestic Government revenue and some UP revenue (the amount collected from&#13;
road users through fuel levies and other charges is estimated to be adequate to cover maintenance needs&#13;
of the total road network); only in the case of Rural roads (Rl, R2 and R3) the foreign-funded Food-&#13;
for-Work program funds part of maintenance through the Road Maintenance Program (RMP) funded&#13;
by Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA); this is a well-designed program targeting&#13;
destitute women as workers, and with participation of the UPs in road selection and in financial&#13;
contribution of minimum 10% of the maintenance costs (see para. 2.15) for maintenance allocations.&#13;
This foreign aid program which covers about 44% of total maintenance funding may be expected to&#13;
continue for some years as this is an effective poverty -reduction program and may therefore receive&#13;
priority in the aid programs for Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world. During Credit&#13;
negotiations. assurance was obtained from Governrnent to match these funds from own or other&#13;
sources, if this RMP program is downsized or discontinued in future. It is important for sustainability&#13;
and ownership that the local government resources for maintenance should progressively increase; the&#13;
proposed project seeks to do this through measures to enhance the resource base of the UPs (see para.&#13;
1.35) and increased Government allocation for maintenance. Maintenance of markets is adequately&#13;
financed by direct user charges levied from market users (see para. 1.25), and a similar system would&#13;
be introduced also for the developed river jetties under the project. The ongoing use and promotion of&#13;
labor-intensive technology for maintenance with appropriate small equipment makes infrastructure&#13;
maintenance technology affordable and available in the rural areas, enhancing sustainability, in addition&#13;
to generating employment. Assurances on adequate maintenance funding and arrangements in the&#13;
project area and at the national level would be obtained during Credit negotiations. (See paras. 2.15,&#13;
2.16, and also Annex 2.8 on maintenance details).&#13;
F. IMPACT OF RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.49   A major study on the impact of rural infrastructure in Bangladesh was published in 19902.&#13;
This surveyed 129 villages which were classified as "developed" and "undeveloped" based on access to&#13;
transport, modern inputs, electricity and economic, social and administrative services, and were&#13;
2          R. Ahmed and M. Hossain. Developmental Impact of Rural Infrastructure, Bangladesh.&#13;
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in collaboration with Bangladesh Institute&#13;
of Development Studies (BIDS), 1990&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
comparable in all other respects. The study found that, comparing the two categories, the villages with&#13;
"developed" infrastructure were significantly better off as reflected in: higher farm agate prices for&#13;
produce, lower fertilizer prices paid, higher house-hold income, higher wage rates benefiting the poor,&#13;
and higher level of employment and income for the landless and the poor women.&#13;
1.50   Socio-economic monitoring and evaluation (SEM&amp;E) studies carried out under different Rural&#13;
development Projects (RDP) implemented by LGED, including the IDA-supported RRMIMP-1,&#13;
provide consistent evidence that FRB road improvements:&#13;
(a)    generated a substantial increase in the total movement of people and goods: on&#13;
improved RRMIMP-1 roads the volume of both passenger and cargo traffic (in&#13;
passenger-km and ton-km) has increased by over 70% in the case of cargo and over&#13;
174% in the case of passenger traffic within a year of development;&#13;
(b)    reduced transport charges: on improved RRMIMP-1 roads unit transport charges for&#13;
goods and passengers have decreased by 63 % and 59% respectively (reflecting reduced&#13;
operating costs and shift to more efficient modal composition, such as reduced head-&#13;
porterage and bullock cart use);&#13;
(c)   resulted in a transfer to more efficient modes, with substantial growth  in vehicular&#13;
traffic - both non-motorized and motorized -- and a reduction in pedestrian and bullock&#13;
cart trips;&#13;
(d)   increased the number of both motorized and non-motorized vehicles by 165%  and&#13;
146% respectively; and increased the relative share of traffic volumes (tkm and pkm)&#13;
carried by motorized traffic: from 47 % share to 73 % share after road development in&#13;
the case of cargo, and from 22% to 47% in the case of passenger traffic;&#13;
(e)    stimulated the operation of bus services for the first time (except on short FRBs below&#13;
about 2 kIn) which bring many social benefits;&#13;
(f)   reduced the operating costs and transport charges of rickshaws and rickshaw-vans by&#13;
up to 60%, because of the provision of a smooth running surface; and&#13;
(g)    produced significant new employment for the poor through direct and indirect impacts.&#13;
1.51   The LGED SEM&amp;E studies have also analyzed the impact of improving marketing facilities.&#13;
They show that, after improvement, the number of market visitors and the volume and value of goods&#13;
traded increases, losses due to spoilage decrease, the lease values (bid prices) of the markets rise, and&#13;
new shops and commercial activities start up around the markets, and land value of the areas near the&#13;
market increases significantly. The markets become more efficient, and busier and more active trading&#13;
and commercial centers.&#13;
1.52   Based on a partial analysis (that is, counting only easily quantifiable transport cost savings&#13;
from road improvements, and spoilage reduction due to market improvements, and ignoring the several&#13;
other economic and social benefits from increased access and mobility such as improved school, health&#13;
and banking facilities, and more employment creation particularly for the poor) completion studies&#13;
under RRMIMP-1 sub-projects show an average 22% (range 14 - 45%) economic rate of return (ERR)&#13;
from road projects, and about the same rate from markets, which shows the very high economic impact&#13;
of these investments. They also show major impact in creating employment (see para. 4.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
1.53   The Rural Infrastructure Strategy study (see para. 1.45) also documents the significant&#13;
regionwide impact of road and market development on agricultural productivity. Another recent IDA-&#13;
sponsored study3 shows significant impact of rural infrastructure investment on non-farm production,&#13;
especially trade and services. Another recent IDA-sponsored study shows significant impact of rural&#13;
infrastructure investment on on-farm employment. Since SEME impact studies have been focused&#13;
mainly on traffic impact and partial benefits, the proposed project would finance a fuller study of the&#13;
impact of the road and market investments on poverty, income levels, and agricultural productivity&#13;
based on more comprehensive data collection including house-hold surveys and analysis, which should&#13;
help guide the massive investments needed in the sector. (Annex 1.4 gives more details on past impact&#13;
studies).&#13;
G. IDA INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECTOR: LESSONS&#13;
1.54   IDA's first major investment in Bangladesh in rural infrastructure development (apart from&#13;
infrastructure components in other projects), has been in financing the Rural Roads and Markets&#13;
Improvement and Maintenance Project (RRMIMP-1, approved in 1988 with an IDA credit of SDR&#13;
45.0 million with cofinancing from KfW and SDC) implemented by LGED, and aimed at improving&#13;
rural infrastructure conditions in Districts of the Northwest region, and at institutional strengthening of&#13;
LGED. The project comprises the improvement of 500 km of FRB roads to bitumen-surfaced&#13;
standard; tree plantation on the sides of the roads; construction of improved public facilities - internal&#13;
roads, paved areas, raised and covered selling areas, drainage, potable water supply and latrines - at 65&#13;
growth center markets; construction of 4,000 meters of structures on Rural Roads; maintenance of the&#13;
inproved roads; and institutional development activities including construction of a new LGED&#13;
headquarters building, construction of LGED District offices and laboratories, training, contractor&#13;
development, and socio-economic monitoring and evaluation. It also included rehabilitation works&#13;
following major floods in 1988. In view of the need to evolve new systems, standards, procedures and&#13;
local capacity of LGED, contractors and consultants in planning and implementing rural infrastructure&#13;
projects on a sustainable basis, this project was designed and approved as an experimental project in its&#13;
early phase, with an implementation period of 8 years. The project faced initial delays in appointing&#13;
supervision consultants and disruptions caused by two major floods in the project area, but is now&#13;
making excellent progress, has issued all contracts for works, and is expected to complete in June&#13;
1997, fully achieving all its physical and most of its institutional objectives, within the original cost&#13;
estimates. The project investments have also made significant economic impact in removing rural&#13;
mobility and marketing constraints, and shown high economic returns from completed components (see&#13;
para. 1.49). The project has been very successful in establishing good quality standards for road&#13;
construction with local materials and expertise through trial prograrns, which are now being replicated&#13;
nationally, and also in enhancing capacity of LGED and local consultants and contractors. Some&#13;
lessons from the experience of this project are: (a) starting bidding processes before project start, and&#13;
appointing supervision consultants before Credit approval so as to avoid delays, (b) more local&#13;
community participation in priority setting, design and implementation, (c) greater emphasis on rural&#13;
road structures, (d) emphasis on river jetties to better integrate inland water transport and road&#13;
transport, (e) continued training and equipment support to small contractors but at the same time&#13;
supporting increase in contract sizes to enhance contractor output and efficiency (f) early action on land&#13;
acquisition with suitable compensation procedures, (h) greater emphasis on field-level training and&#13;
implementation of maintenance programs, (i) overhauling rural market management and leasing&#13;
systems with greater user participation to improve efficiency and increase revenue and (j) strengthening&#13;
the financial status of local bodies (Union Parishads) in ensuring sustainability of infrastructure&#13;

maintenance.  These lessons from  the ongoing project and other RDPs have been carefully&#13;
incorporated in designing the proposed larger RRMIMP-2, which is designed with a shorter&#13;
implementation period of five years since the experimental phase is considered over and much more&#13;
prior preparation has been done before start of the project, and LGED has now proven capacity to&#13;
implement projects more expeditiously.&#13;
1.55  IDA's experience as reflected in the Operations Evaluation Department's (OED's) reports of&#13;
similar "regional" rural road projects have shown that they would achieve their developmental&#13;
objectives with greater impact only if the project components also include improving national standards&#13;
in maintenance, design and planning, and promotion of network-wide maintenance. This has been&#13;
taken into account in designing the proposed project by supporting the implementation of an effective&#13;
maintenance program in the project area to be replicated nationally and by requiring allocation of&#13;
adequate maintenance funds for the national rural road network and designation of maintenance&#13;
engineers in LGED's field offices. (see para. 2.16 and 2.17).&#13;
1.56  In the overall transport sector, IDA has funded eight projects so far, of which three have been&#13;
completed and five are on going. The completed projects are - two highway projects, and one port&#13;
project. The road projects faced implementation problems which were resolved, and their Completion&#13;
report (1989) highlighted lessons for future action (such as preparation of road master plans for&#13;
prioritizing rehabilitation and maintenance, better maintenance systems, improved contracting&#13;
procedures, and contractor strengthening) which have been incorporated into the subsequent projects.&#13;
The port project was very successful and its Completion Report (1993) highlighted the need for timely&#13;
funding of equipment along with berth facilities, and greater emphasis on container facilities; these&#13;
lessons are being taken into account in the ongoing port sector studies and port project preparation,&#13;
with emphasis on private sector provision of equipment, other facilities and operations. The five&#13;
ongoing projects are: (i) Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP-1 approved in 1987,&#13;
with IDA credit of SDR 78.1 million, with cofinancing from OPEC Fund), which will complete in&#13;
December 1996, (ii) and RRMP-2 (approved in 1994 with IDA credit of SDR 103.9 million, with&#13;
cofinancing from the British Overseas Development Administration (ODA); both these projects focus&#13;
on the physical rehabilitation and maintenance needs, and on planning and maintenance systems, and&#13;
institutional support, for the national and regional roads managed by RHD (as distinct from rural roads&#13;
managed by LGED); (iii) the RRMIMP-1 project for rural roads and markets, already discussed in the&#13;
previous paragraph; (iv) the Inland Water Transport Project for which IDA credit of SDR 31.3 million&#13;
was approved in 1991; and (v) the Jamuna Bridge Project for which IDA credit of SDR 143.6 million&#13;
was approved in 1994, with cofinancing from ADB and OECF. The IWT project faced many initial&#13;
problems due to delays in starting important institutional reform studies, which have later been&#13;
resolved. All ongoing projects are progressing satisfactorily. IDA has also been involved as executing&#13;
agency for a UNDP-funded study on transport sector planning and strategy, which was completed in&#13;
1995; Government has accepted its recommendations for follow-up.&#13;
&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND CONCEPT&#13;
2.1    At the Mid-Term Review of the RRMIMP-1 project in May 1992 it was agreed to prepare a&#13;
new rural infrastructure Improvement project as a follow-up to continue similar programs. The concept&#13;
of the proposed project has been developed during the course of the ongoing project and of IDA's&#13;
review of the GOB rural infrastructure strategy, which highlights continued need to invest on&#13;
improving rural infrastructure. GOB's and IDA's review of agriculture strategy also emphasizes rural&#13;
infrastructure improvements as a priority. Much has been learnt from the experience of the RRMIMP- 1&#13;
(see para. 1.53), and from the simultaneous SDC-financed rural development project (RDP-6) in&#13;
Manikganj District of Greater Dhaka, and also from other RDPs. During the period of implementation&#13;
of these projects the LGED has grown and evolved rapidly as an effective, rural infrastructure&#13;
development institution.&#13;
2.2    The proposed RRMIMP-2 project will be co-financed with the SDC and will include additional&#13;
physical works in the Northwest Region but with greater emphasis on works in the contiguous Greater&#13;
Dhaka Area where there has been only limited rural infrastructure investment to date. As noted,&#13;
individual projects under RDP series focus on infrastructure needs of particular regions, funded by&#13;
different agencies, well coordinated by LGED. The project area for RRMIMP-2 was selected for the&#13;
following reasons: (a) continuity with on-going IDA and SDC work; (b) relatively higher poverty&#13;
level; (c) absence of any previous RDP in the Greater Dhaka Area (except in one District); and (d)&#13;
poor infrastructure conditions in the whole project area.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.3    The overall development objective of the proposed project is to help increase rural employment&#13;
and incomes and reduce rural poverty by establishing an improved, sustainable rural transport and&#13;
trading infrastructure. More specifically, the project objectives would be to:&#13;
(a)    help remove physical bottlenecks, improve quality, and reduce costs in rural transport&#13;
and marketing;&#13;
(b)    create employment and income-generating opportunities among the rural poor, and&#13;
particularly for disadvantaged women;&#13;
(c)    promote participation of local communities and NGOs in project activities; and&#13;
(d)   increase institutional capacity for efficient rural infrastructure management, including&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
2.4   Performance indicators for monitoring progress in achieving the project objectives are given in&#13;
Annex 3.7.&#13;
C. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.5    The project would support GOB's and IDA's overall strategy to increase agricultural&#13;
production and rural incomes, and to reduce poverty through removing rural infrastructure constraints.&#13;
IDA's Strategy for the Transport Sector and rural infrastructure in Bangladesh follows the 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by IDA Board in September 1995, which emphasized&#13;
improving physical infrastructure, their maintenance, and related services, as they are critical for both&#13;
international competitiveness of exports and the growth of agriculture and rural incomes. It also&#13;
emphasized, for rural infrastructure, encouraging greater participation by local communities, increasing&#13;
resource mobilization, adopting national standards, and strengthening local contractors.  CAS also&#13;
stresses labor-intensive growth, and special measures for poverty-alleviation. The proposed RRMIMP-&#13;
2, which relies on appropriate labor-intensive technology for most civil works with special provisions&#13;
for employing the poor, and which gives high priority for improving rural infrastructure and&#13;
community involvement is fully consistent with the CAS.&#13;
2.6    The ongoing project, RRMIMP-1, has set many good, new standards in rural road design&#13;
specifications and maintenance; it is important to provide continuity by replicating them in other areas&#13;
and by building on institutional and policy gains already achieved through the first project so as to&#13;
keep the momentum  of progress in rural development going at an accelerated pace.  IDA's&#13;
involvement, which is much appreciated by the Government and other donors, will provide such&#13;
continuity.  IDA support is needed also to: (a) encourage appropriate technology, cost-effective&#13;
standards; and sustainable maintenance systems, (b) attract cofinancing support; and (c) help implement&#13;
the findings of the IDA/GOB rural infrastructure study.&#13;
D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Components&#13;
2.7    The main components of the project are:&#13;
(i)    improvement and upgrading of about 575 km of feeder roads Type B (FRBs) in&#13;
the Project Area (14 districts in the Northwest and Greater Dhaka areas, see&#13;
para. 2.9), with small bridges, culverts and tree planting alongside the roads.&#13;
It also includes bridges and culverts on other FRB roads not selected for full&#13;
improvement, and road safety improvements;&#13;
(ii)   establishment and  implementation  of a planned  routine  and  periodic&#13;
maintenance system for the LGED road network in the project area covering&#13;
all FRB roads, important RR1 roads, and structures on rural roads for&#13;
replication nationally in the following years;&#13;
(iii)   construction of about 6000 culverts and small bridges (about 31,600 linear&#13;
meters) of drainage structures on existing rural roads (mainly RR1 &amp; RR2)&#13;
(Nationwide), together with ancillary earthworks, which will fill existing gaps&#13;
on about 10,500 km of rural roads and make them passable year-round, and&#13;
also correct drainage problems created by existing rural roads; this component&#13;
will particularly emphasize local participation, use of labor-intensive&#13;
technologies, and employment of landless poor and disadvantaged women;&#13;
(iv)   improvement of rural markets (i.e., raised and covered sales platforms,&#13;
walkways, drainage, potable water supply, sanitation) in about 136 growth&#13;
center markets in the project area, and improvement of about 14 UP center&#13;
markets in the project area;&#13;
(v)    rehabilitation/construction of 41 priority river jetties, or river 'ghats', in the&#13;
project area, to improve landing/unloading facilities for country boats;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
(vi)   pilot program to improve safety and efficiency of NMT, particularly rickshaw&#13;
vans and passenger rickshaws, which are extensively used in the country in the&#13;
movement of goods and passengers in rural areas, with participation of&#13;
appropriate NGOs;&#13;
(vii)  supply of equipment for road construction and maintenance, of vehicles for&#13;
supervision of works, and of office and training equipment;&#13;
(viii)  institutional and human resources development for increasing and strengthening&#13;
managerial and technical capacity of LGED, local Government agencies, and&#13;
the local construction industry, including support for fiscal and technical&#13;
audits; and;&#13;
(ix)   implementation support including  technical assistance  for the  design,&#13;
supervision, monitoring and evaluation of annual work programs, and support&#13;
for a follow-up rural infrastructure project preparation.&#13;
2.8   The additional features in this project compared to the first are: addition of river transport and&#13;
integration of rural transport; support for improving non-motorized transport; more community&#13;
participation, raising more local resources and more emphasis on rural drainage structures on existing&#13;
rural roads; and greater emphasis on maintenance, and on adoption of national standards in&#13;
construction and maintenance.  The proposed project, in design and concept, will provide the&#13;
cornerstone for a new generation of road transport and infrastructure projects; it will build on&#13;
experience and lessons learned from the ongoing RRMIMP-1, and will complement and reinforce its&#13;
achievements.&#13;
Project Area&#13;
2.9   The project area (Map IBRD No. 27808) covers 14 Districts of Bangladesh (out of total 64)&#13;
comprising: (a) six Districts of Greater Dhaka Area (Map IBRD No.27727) - Manikganj, Munshiganj,&#13;
Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narshingdi and Dhaka Districts - of which only Manikganj District has&#13;
benefited from other RDPs; and (b) eight districts of the Northwest Region (Map IBRD No. 27726) -&#13;
Rajshahi, Naogaon, Natore, Nawabganj, Pabna, Sirajganj, Bogra and Joypurhat Districts - which&#13;
already benefit from the ongoing RRMIMP-1 in the Northwest Region. The Northwest Area has 64&#13;
Thanas and 608 Union Parishads (UPs), and the Greater Dhaka Area has 33 Thanas and 361 UPs. In&#13;
addition, the rural structure component (25 % of the project cost) covers all UPs in the whole country.&#13;
2.10   The project area covers about 25,000 sq. km and has a population of about 22 million people&#13;
within this area. The Northwest Area is larger (72% of the land area) but less densely populated (62%&#13;
of the population) than the Greater Dhaka Area. The construction of the Jamuna Multi-Purpose Bridge&#13;
will significantly improve communications between the Northwest Region and the rest of the country,&#13;
and create opportunities for economic development. The rural road network in the project area&#13;
comprises about 3200 km of FRB, and 29,800 km of rural roads (9,450 km of RR1, 10,150 km of R2&#13;
and 10,200 km of R3), and there is a total of 425 growth center markets. By mid-1997, when the&#13;
RRMIMP-1 and the SDC financed RDP-6 (which covers Manikganj) projects end, about 31 % of the&#13;
FRB network (39% in the Northwest Region and 14% in the Greater Dhaka Area) will be in good,&#13;
bitumen-surfaced condition, and 18% of the growth center Markets (25% in the Northwest Region,&#13;
6% in the Greater Dhaka Area) will have been improved. Even after the completion of the proposed&#13;
project, the total coverage of rural infrastructure improvement needs in these 14 districts will be about&#13;
50-60%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Detailed Features&#13;
(a)   Improvement and Upgrading Feeder Roads B: (Base cost US$58.60 million)&#13;
2.11   Many FRBs in the project area are earthen embankments - most of them constructed under&#13;
food for work programs but without mechanical compaction - often with unspanned 'gaps' across&#13;
rivers and flood land. Some FRBs have been paved with Herring Bone Bond brick (HBB) but often&#13;
without full compaction of the embankment resulting in a rough riding surface, and a few sections have&#13;
been given a bituminous seal. The project would improve and upgrade about 574 km FRB roads (312&#13;
km in the Greater Dhaka Area and 262 km are in the Northwest Region on about 69 roads in all),&#13;
including construction of 1915 metres of bridges and culverts, to provide all-weather road access to&#13;
serve rural growth center markets. In addition to the full improvement and upgrading of FRB roads to&#13;
bitumen-surfaced standards (including all necessary structures), the project includes a sub-component&#13;
'construction of structures on other FRB roads'. This reflects the need to bridge existing gaps and&#13;
replace damaged structures on some of the other FRBs not selected for full upgrading in order to&#13;
extend the mobility on the FRB road network in the project area. This would comprise construction&#13;
of about 1,750 linear meters of small bridges and structures; two-third of these, will be in the more&#13;
riverine Greater Dhaka Area. The project would include provision for improved road safety.&#13;
2.12   The FRB roads and structures have been selected using a participatory approach involving&#13;
consultation with local bodies - UPs, TDCCs and NGOs - to derive a short-list of roads based on local&#13;
priorities, which were then subjected to economic appraisal. All selected roads have an EIRR greater&#13;
than 12%. Structures larger than 30 linear meter span will be subjected to economic appraisal before&#13;
bidding. The selection procedures and criteria, and implementation procedures and time-frame, using&#13;
active involvement of beneficiaries, based on specially designed participatory processes (para 3.1) for&#13;
proposed physical investment schemes under various project components are given in Annex 2. 1; these&#13;
criteria, procedures and pro grams were agreed during negotiations. Most FRB roads and FRB&#13;
structures have been selected; if changes are needed they will follow the agreed selection criteria, and&#13;
the changes will be reviewed during mid-term review. The list of proposed FRB roads, markets and&#13;
river jetties, is given in Annex 2.2; this was confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
2.13   The proposed FRB design standards (PID-3) are based on  the design standards of ongoing&#13;
RRMIMP-1, with refinements made in the light of experience for various RDPs and trials. The&#13;
pavement structure will comprise an improved sub-grade, coarse aggregate (brick) sub-base and water&#13;
bound macadam (WBM) base course using brick aggregate, and a 25 mm bituminous carpeting (BC)&#13;
surface. In specific circumstances where the traffic level on FRB is high, the thickness of BC will be&#13;
increased to 40 mm provided if it is economically justified, and where the traffic level on FRB is low,&#13;
the thickness of the BC will be reduced to 15 mm. The surfacing specification of providing 25 mm BC&#13;
under normal traffic conditions, is based on a studies carried out by LGED and the consultants, on the&#13;
performance of several trial sections of different specifications observed during the implementation&#13;
phase of various RDPs. Furthermore the design of 25 mm BC for surface treatment on FRBs, has&#13;
been determined from the extensive discussions held between the experts of IDAISDC and LGED in&#13;
the context of all economical and technical implications involved in the selection of pavement&#13;
thickness. A special factor to take into account in the context of Bangladesh is the fact that the broken&#13;
bricks (used for surfacing in lieu of natural laterite stones due to non-availability of the latter) lacks&#13;
plasticity to bond; such paving eliminates the risk of these surfacing materials being washed away in&#13;
the heavy rains common in Bangladesh, thus giving longer life and lesser maintenance costs. It also&#13;
significantly reduces the roughness of the surface, allowing the predominant cycle-rickshaws (human-&#13;
pedaled) easy ridability; transport cost savings justified the additional cost on paving of these important&#13;
roads. The project includes the construction of trial sections in order to promote the use of possible&#13;
bitumen emulsions, which if successful can prove to be highly cost-effective in the construction of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
rural roads. The base course will be extended 600 mm on either side of the carriageway to provide a&#13;
hard shoulder on both sides. This hard shoulder will protect the earth shoulder from damage during&#13;
rains, and will also improve safety particularly under the prevailing conditions where the traffic is mix&#13;
of motorized and non-motorized.&#13;
2.14   Groups of disadvantaged women will be contracted to plant and take care of the trees alongside&#13;
FRB roads and to carry out routine maintenance of the embankment slopes and earth shoulders, thus&#13;
creating long-term employment. Based on GOB policy, ownership of the trees will be arranged so that&#13;
the income they generate provides revenue for the UPs and gives benefits to the destitute women&#13;
caretakers. The project will also finance the construction of a new LGED District&#13;
office/laboratory/workshop facility in Dhaka District (which is the one project district where LGED&#13;
does not yet have such a facility) and improvement of existing facilities in other Districts.  The&#13;
technical standards and unit cost for various road construction activities are given in PID-3.&#13;
(b)    Road Maintenance: (Base cost US$10.76 million)&#13;
2.15   The project attaches great importance to building an adequate maintenance management system&#13;
in the country, based on best practice and techniques. LGED received its first GOB annual revenue&#13;
budget for maintenance in FY 1992/93, and the budget has increased progressively since then - Taka&#13;
300 million (US$7.5 million) in 1992/93, Taka 400 million (US$10.0 million) in 1993/94, Taka 550&#13;
million (US$13.8 million) in 1994/95 and Taka 650 million (US$16.3 million) in 1995/96. A Rural&#13;
Infrastructure Maintenance Cell (RIMC) was established within LGED in 1992, and since then it has&#13;
made considerable progress in establishing the framework for road maintenance by setting up a road&#13;
inventory system, introducing national maintenance guidelines and establishing a training program.&#13;
However actual maintenance works in the field is still inadequate in many respects and need&#13;
improvements. The other main source for funding maintenance of rural roads is the CIDA/CARE&#13;
Road Maintenance Program (RMP), which is designed as a poverty-alleviation program for destitute&#13;
women.  To complement and support its efforts for setting up an effective, planned periodic&#13;
maintenance system, the project would provide 50% of the periodic maintenance costs in the project&#13;
area on a declining percentage basis over the implementation period, starting 80% in the first three&#13;
years and decreasing to 30% in the last two years. The project would finance: (a) TA for setting up&#13;
and designing an effective and efficient management system in the project area, which would be part of&#13;
the DSM consultant services (para. 2.38); and (b) provide partial funding of periodic maintenance in&#13;
the project area. This assistance would be provided in coordination with RIMC's program and other&#13;
ADB financed inputs for maintenance strengthening.&#13;
2.16   Tables 3 and 4 in the Annex 2.8 provides an estimate of the needs and costs (including unit&#13;
cost) of routine and periodic maintenance within the project area over the project period.  These&#13;
figures will be used for preparing annual maintenance plans and budgets (see para. 2.17). These&#13;
amounts will be revised by mutual agreement in the light of further studies planned to be carried out&#13;
during project implementation.&#13;
2.17   The project also attaches significant importance to the routine and periodic maintenance of the&#13;
national rural road network. RIMC is taking leadership in improving national maintenance strategy.&#13;
The recently prepared GOB rural infrastructure strategy paper has projected that the country will need&#13;
an annual recurrent cost (annualized routine and periodic maintenance costs) of about US$33 million&#13;
equivalent in 1995-96, increasing to about US$73 million annually in ten years as the road network is&#13;
upgraded requiring more maintenance (See Annex 1.4). Although GOB has increased its maintenance&#13;
budget allocations substantially in the current year 1995/96 to US$16.3 million to meet full current&#13;
needs compared with the allocations made in previous years (para. 2.15), it will need to make increases&#13;
in this amount in future as maintenance capability increases. The estimated maintenance needs for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
1995-96 are being fully met from various sources, including Government budget allocation for&#13;
maintenance, UP contributions, some project inputs and the food-aid-supported Road Maintenance&#13;
Program (RMP) funded by Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) (about US$11 million&#13;
for 1996-97), which is a well-designed project targeting income generation for destitute women by&#13;
involving them and UPs in a very effective and participatory rural road maintenance program. Based&#13;
on some projection of continued UP and other project contributions (see Annex 1.4), and assuming the&#13;
continuation of the RMP program, it has been estimated that Government's budget allocation for rural&#13;
road maintenance will have to increase as a minimum to about US$21 million in 1997-98 and US$31&#13;
million in 2001-02. To get assurance of meeting full maintenance funding, agreement was obtained&#13;
during negotiations that the GOB would provide adequate fundinig for meeting full routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance costs for all maintainable FRBs. RRs and structures during the project period, and for this&#13;
purpose would increase its budget allocation for rural road maintenance to US$21 million in 1997-98,&#13;
and thereafter annually increase it by US$2.5 million up to the year 2001-02. It will also be agreed&#13;
that in case the RMP program, which currently provides about US$11 million equivalent for rural&#13;
infrastructure maintenance, is downsized or discontinued, the Government would provide additional&#13;
budget allocation or ensure other funding to continue similar program and to make up for the resulting&#13;
reduction in maintenance funding. These amounts will be revised by mutual agreement in the light of&#13;
further studies planned to be carried out during project implementation. In addition, the poor rural&#13;
roads which are not in a maintainable condition due to prolonged deterioration, are in the immediate&#13;
need of rehabilitation. At present there is no separate line for rehabilitation works under LGED's&#13;
budget system. It is therefore necessary that the GOB and LGED should include separate allocation&#13;
for rehabilitation until the roads are improved and placed under a sustainable maintenance program.&#13;
2.18   Agreement was reached during negotiations that LGED would agree with IDA before June 30&#13;
of each year annual maintenance program for the project area for the following fiscal year; the&#13;
program for 1996-97 would be provided by January 31, 1997. The annual maintenance program would&#13;
include the estimated funding requirements for routine and periodic maintenance separately for FRB,&#13;
RRs, and structures for the project area. In order to carry out maintenance operations more effectively&#13;
and efficiently in the field, agreement was reached during negotiations that LGED would designate a&#13;
maintenance engineer in each district and thana by March 31. 1997. In addition, as part of agreed&#13;
implementation procedures (para. 2.12 and Annex 2.1), LGED would promote greater community&#13;
participation in road maintenance, and for this purpose would, in consultation with IDA, pilot greater&#13;
community involvement in maintenance in two districts, starting not later than June 30, 1998. LGED&#13;
would also set up District-level road user committees in the project area (para. 3.2).&#13;
(c)    Construction of Drainage Structures on Rural Roads (SRR) (Base cost US$55.08 million)&#13;
2.19   This component, which is national in scope and not limited to the 14 districts, would assist&#13;
through participatory process, to fill large number of gaps existing in the rural road network and will&#13;
help local communities in removing a major constraint they face in rural transport; it will also help to&#13;
build new drainage structures where existing roads block cross-drainage. In Bangladesh, there are&#13;
about 40,000 gaps (200,000 linear meters), yet to be bridged on its rural road network, which make&#13;
the roads fragmented and less effective for all-weather mobility. Since the central government has to&#13;
focus on FRB improvements costing over US$1.5 billion over the next 10 years, the only solution&#13;
would be for the UP's to raise own resources and take on their own initiative to fill these road gaps.&#13;
These gaps force closure of roads in rainy season, and block smooth flow of traffic in fair season. The&#13;
structures are good investments in reducing transport costs and mobility constraints in the rural areas&#13;
and reducing waterlogging in farms.  Because it involves a large number of small, dispersed&#13;
investments where priorities are best defined locally, the SRR component provides the opportunity to&#13;
encourage the participation of communities, local bodies and other interest groups in planning,&#13;
decision-making and implementation. Field interviews show that there is enthusiasm among UP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
Chairmen to participate in this program. All the participatory aspects of the component are detailed in&#13;
Annexes 2.1 and 2.3. This component, through participatory process, community ownership, and&#13;
initial deposit by UPs to signal (para 2.22) their commitment, will start a new culture in the planning,&#13;
development and maintenance of transportation infrastructure in the rural areas.&#13;
2.20   On the 16,000 km of RRI and RR2 roads in the main project area there are estimated to be&#13;
5,600 unspanned gaps with a total length of about 30,000 linear meters, and a further 3,400 existing&#13;
structures, with a total length of about 14,000 linear meters, which are in poor or damaged condition&#13;
and require replacement or repair. This equates to more than one gap or damaged structure for every&#13;
1.75 km of Rural Road. The project will finance the construction of about 6,000 structures (31,600&#13;
linear meters) on RRs all over the country - primarily pipe and slab culverts and small bridges - to&#13;
span gaps and replace damaged structures, together with ancillary earthworks. It will also finance new&#13;
structures where existing road embankments block drainage between farm areas. This will make about&#13;
10,500 km of seasonal rural roads into all-weather roads, thus enhancing the value of existing&#13;
investments (one structure of US$8,000 releasing full economic use of about U$50,000 worth of&#13;
investment on 1.75 km roads).  The annual construction program, and its geographic scope, is&#13;
presented in PID-2. It is expected that some of the structures will be built on R3 roads subject to UP's&#13;
preferences.&#13;
2.21   An amount of about US$55.08 million as base cost, is allocated for this component, of which&#13;
US$47.70 million equivalent is for drainage structures (culverts and small bridges not exceeding 20 m&#13;
length) on rural roads, and about US$7.38 million equivalent for ancillary earth works on rural roads&#13;
(as approaches to the structures or elsewhere on the rural roads).  As an indicative figure (not&#13;
restrictive), the average length (span) of culvert is likely to be 5 meters, at a cost of about US$8,000&#13;
equivalent. All UPs will be allowed to participate on a first-come-first-served basis, according to the&#13;
date of registration. The participating UP has to deposit an initial Taka 10,000 (US$250) into LGED&#13;
SRR account for registration, and indicate the location for the structures. After registration, LGED will&#13;
inspect the selected site and make drawings and estimates and discuss with the UP choices of types and cost&#13;
estimates. Technical standards for structures were developed under RRMIMP-1 and would be further&#13;
improved as indicator in PID-3. Before award of contract, the UP must deposit the remaining contribution&#13;
(above the initial deposit) to LGED's SRR account. UP's total contribution will be 10% of total costs&#13;
during the first three years of the project and 20% during the last two years of the project. After selection&#13;
of site and design by the UP, LGED Thana Engineer through the TDCC Tender Committees, will invite&#13;
bids from small contractors and eligible labor contracting societies (LCS)/Labor Groups, and select lowest&#13;
evaluated bidder following usual procedures acceptable to IDA.  Earthworks outside the structure&#13;
approaches will be awarded to LCSs/labor groups of poor women/landless laborers based on negotiated&#13;
contracts and unit rates under procedures acceptable to IDA. These selection criteria and processes are&#13;
listed in Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.22   The construction of SRR will be a continual process and the sites will be selected by UPs&#13;
through a participatory process involving two stages (see para. 3.1 and Annex 2.3) and in accordance&#13;
with the agreed selection criteria given in Annex 2.1. In addition, each participating UP should&#13;
undertake to provide: (a) regular maintenance of structures after its completion; (b) monitoring data&#13;
relating to funding resources, length passable, traffic growth and employment of the poor. The&#13;
implementation procedures agreed (para. 2.12) require that UPs should conform to the following and&#13;
other criteria/procedures given in Annex 2. 1: (a) site selection criteria agreed for the construction of&#13;
SRR; (b) initial deposit of Taka 10,000 into the LGED SRR account for registration; (c) deposit of&#13;
total UP's contribution before inviting bids; (d) sustainable maintenance program for the completed&#13;
structures, and (e) provide agreed data for  monitoring project success and evaluation of its&#13;
development impact on the rural economy. LGED will undertake to provide the completed structure&#13;
within one year of registration by UP; this guarantee will apply only to the first 1500 structures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
registered for each year, because of possible capacity limitations, and further there may also be a limit&#13;
on the total number of structures per UP.&#13;
(d)   Improvement of Rural Markets: (Base cost US$10.69 million)&#13;
2.23   Growth center markets are focal points for the sale and processing of rural produce, for the&#13;
distribution of agricultural inputs and consumer goods imported into rural areas, and for other&#13;
economic and social activities. Unimproved markets are congested, unhygienic, dusty in the dry and&#13;
muddy in the wet - a problem compounded by the fact that many markets are low-lying, close to rivers&#13;
and not free-draining. Many markets trade in meat and fish, but without adequate facilities for&#13;
hygienic operations. The project would finance basic infrastructure and improved common facilities at&#13;
136 growth center markets, 67 in the Greater Dhaka Area and 69 in the Northwest Region. The main&#13;
improvements would include covered sheds for the sale of perishable goods, slaughter slabs, sales&#13;
platform, internal roads and walkways within the market areas and connecting with the main feeder&#13;
roads serving the market area, drains, latrines, garbage pits, provision of parking space and an office&#13;
for market administration. Production of bio-gas from garbage pits will be tried on a pilot basis. The&#13;
project would also include improvement of about 14 other rural markets - one in each project district -&#13;
to be developed as model UP market centers with improved transport terminal facilities and access.&#13;
2.24   Priority has also been given to integrating road, inland water transport, and market&#13;
improvements in order to enhance the efficient operation of the rural transport and trading network.&#13;
The selection procedure, and criteria  for markets are given in Annex 2.1, and the list of selected&#13;
markets and is given in Annex 2.2. The design standards and costs for market improvements are&#13;
detailed in PID-4. The 'Users Input' participatory approach will be applied to the detailed design of the&#13;
markets, which will involve market vendors and other users in design. The user participation in&#13;
selection and detailed design will develop a sense of local ownership of the improved markets.&#13;
Additional participatory measures will be adopted to improve the operation of the markets. The UPs&#13;
will contribute 10% of investment costs. The project will assist and support the formation of Market&#13;
Management Committees, and will provide them with training and assistance in planning and managing&#13;
the operation and maintenance of the improved markets. Maintenance will be financed from the lease&#13;
revenue of improved markets which is allocated for this purpose and which is considered generally&#13;
adequate (see para. 1.24).  According to the implementation procedures agreed (para. 2.12),&#13;
LGED/UPs will use participatory processes, involving market vendors, to improve the structure and&#13;
operation of the existing Market Management Conmmittees, and to improve market leasing processes to&#13;
enhance revenue.&#13;
(e)    Rehabilitation/Construction of River Jetties (Ghats): (Base cost US$2. 00 million)&#13;
2.25   Inland water transport (IWT) through country boats remains important for the rural movement&#13;
of people and goods. The project will provide improved facilities for the safe, dry, loading and&#13;
unloading of cargo and people at 41 rural river ghats, 14 in the Northwest Region and 27 in the&#13;
Greater Dhaka Area which is more riverine. This will increase the efficiency of loading/unloading,&#13;
increase the role of IWT, reduce transport costs, and will reduce the accidents, injuries and losses that&#13;
presently occur during this process and will provide a healthy environment.  This component&#13;
emphasizes local participation in selection, detailed design and operation of the improved ghats, using&#13;
the same methodology as for the growth center markets. The ghats to be improved have been selected&#13;
by the same procedure as for the markets, and the UPs will contribute 10% of the costs of&#13;
improvement. Attention has also been given to integrating ghat improvements with the improved FRB&#13;
and market network. The selection procedures and criteria are given in Annex 2.1, the list of ghats in&#13;
Annex 2.2, and their annual construction program is given in PID-5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
2.26   The ghat improvements will consist of 'river-bank' facilities for safe loading and unloading and&#13;
for mooring, and 'on-land' facilities comprising a paved area with drainage, footpaths, a passenger&#13;
shed, clean water supply, sanitary latrines, garbage bins, a small administration office and an internal&#13;
access road to connect the ghat to the nearby FRB or main road. The aim is to provide low-cost but&#13;
effective river-bank facilities, and design standards will be evolved as the project develops practical&#13;
experience of designing for different conditions. Most of the ghats selected for improvement serve&#13;
Growth center markets, and their improvement will contribute to the integration of the water/road&#13;
transport and trading network. Ghat users and boat operators will participate in the detailed design of&#13;
the ghats, through application of the Users Input approach. Details of ghat designs and costs are in&#13;
PID-5. All ghats construction works will be on public land, and all improved ghats will be operated&#13;
through competitive leasing.   Measures will be adopted to establish effective operation and&#13;
maintenance of the ghats by the ghat management committees, using the same participatory procedures&#13;
as for the markets component. Involvement of country boat operators/owners associations, one of the&#13;
main user groups of ghats, in the management of the ghats will be emphasized. It was agreed as part of&#13;
implementation procedures (para. 2.12) that GOB will: (a) cause ghat management committee to be&#13;
established for all developed ghats before completion of each ghat improvement, modeled on the&#13;
market management committees; (b) ensure that operation of these ghats and markets will have&#13;
adequate user participation.&#13;
(f)    Pilot Program to Improve Non-Motorized Transport (NMT): (Base cost US$0.96 million)&#13;
2.27   NMT (rickshaw-vans, cycle-rickshaws, bicycles and bullock carts) play a very important role&#13;
in rural transport system in Bangladesh (see para. 1.15). The project includes a pilot component for&#13;
promoting safety and design improvements in rickshaw and rickshaw-vans (which carry more than&#13;
50%  of rural road traffic) and bullock-cart wheels (which damage road pavement).  This pilot&#13;
component will focus on the development and introduction of improvements in the design of rickshaw&#13;
vans, cycle rickshaws and bullock carts on making trial runs through user-groups to further improve&#13;
designs through their feedback; and on measures to stimulate the provision of credit for the purchase of&#13;
the improved designs. While there have previous efforts to improve designs, they were not supported&#13;
by adequate field trials and promotion.   The component, if successful, will increase the&#13;
competitiveness and service level of rickshaw vans and passenger rickshaws by improving their&#13;
performance, cost-efficiency, safety and load carrying capability, and will sustain and increase income-&#13;
generation for the rural poor from rickshaw pulling, it will also reduce the efforts and hardship&#13;
involved in rickshaw driving. The component will also help increase the efficiency and reduce the&#13;
damage caused to improved roads by, bullock carts.&#13;
2.28   The pilot component will adopt a participatory approach to technical innovation. It will be&#13;
implemented through experienced local NGOs and vehicle users, and can potentially make a major&#13;
impact on rural transport in the long run. The approach will be to develop specific improvements to&#13;
the design of cycle rickshaws and rickshaw-vans - e.g. bodies, braking and gear systems - which can&#13;
be fitted to the existing rickshaws as well as incorporated into new vehicles. For bullock carts the&#13;
emphasis will be on introducing wheel/axle assemblies using rubber tires. The improved designs will&#13;
be disseminated through promotion, demonstration and training, in collaboration with the Bangladesh&#13;
National Working Group of the International Forum for Rural Transport and Development (IFRTD,&#13;
and other local NGOs and community groups. This will develop an informed network of organizations,&#13;
including credit-financing NGO agencies, to assist the dissemination of the improved designs and to&#13;
encourage the provision of loans for the purchase of the improved designs by the rural poor. The&#13;
project will also provide for the mobility need assessments related to the improvement and operation of&#13;
NMT. The design, strategy, related issues, implementation program and cost estimate for the&#13;
proposed pilot NMT component are described in more detail in Annex 2.4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
(g)    Equipment: (Base cost US$7.27 million)&#13;
2.29   The project will provide: (a) Construction equipment mainly for compaction and concreting to&#13;
complement existing LGED equipment stocks in the project area; (b) laboratory and field testing&#13;
equipment for the five project Districts in the Greater Dhaka Area that do not have these facilities, and&#13;
a limited provision to upgrade the existing laboratories in the other nine project Districts in the&#13;
Northwest Region; (c) supervision vehicles to complement the existing LGED fleet; (d) office and&#13;
training equipment for project implementation; and (e) the urgently needed MIS related accessories.&#13;
The equipment to be provided under the project is listed in Annex 2.5.&#13;
2.30   The project will help develop, and introduce in the project area, through design improvements,&#13;
innovative items of low-cost, appropriate, locally made equipment to improve the quality and&#13;
efficiency of construction and maintenance activities. Examples are: (a) temperature-controlled bitumen&#13;
heater, temperature-controlled aggregate heater, drum mixer and trolley - to improve the quality and&#13;
efficiency of production and laying of batched quantities of BC; (b) bitumen sprayer for use with both&#13;
hot bitumen and bitumen emulsion; (c) a mobile bitumen trolley to carry one drum of emulsion and&#13;
with a hand pumped spray lance; (d) a manually propelled compaction roller to improve compaction&#13;
for ancillary earthworks on Rural Roads.&#13;
2.31   The equipment produced under the project will ensure the timely completion of project because&#13;
the small local contractors do not have their own equipment and largely depend on LGED equipment&#13;
fleet. LGED fleet is not sufficient to meet the project requirements. The existing scale of rental&#13;
charges for LGED equipment is not sufficient to recover their operating and replacement costs, though&#13;
they are adequate to recover operating and original investment costs. In order to avoid low LGED rent&#13;
rates, discouraging the contractors in buying their own equipment, and to encourage the private sector&#13;
to enter the equipment rental market, agreement was reached during negotiations that GOB would: (a)&#13;
ensure that charges for renting such equipment are sufficient to cover the maintenance and replacement&#13;
costs of such equipment. and (b) make available to LGED annually, through budget allocations into a&#13;
separate identifiable 'item' in LGED's budget, for maintenance and replacement costs of such&#13;
equipment, funds equivalent to the estimated rent collections for the following financial year. To&#13;
promote labor based methods and encourage local contractor to have their own equipment, project&#13;
would help promote use of low-cost locally produced equipment (para. 2.30), and also provide&#13;
mobilization advance to contractors to help purchase of own equipment. To ensure adequate quality&#13;
control in the execution of civil works the project would also finance urgently needed laboratory and&#13;
testing equipment. The DSM consultants would provide technical assistance to LGED to set up an&#13;
efficient equipment management system.&#13;
(h) Institutional and Human Resource Development: (Base cost US$3.54 million)&#13;
2.32   Technical Assistance (Capacity Building): The project will provide Technical assistance to&#13;
strengthen the institutional capacity and capability of LGED, local government bodies and the private&#13;
sector contracting industry. The main focus would be on training district and thana level staff in: (a)&#13;
supervision, quality control and financial and reporting procedures; (b) maintenance planning and&#13;
management; (c) implementation procedures for the SRR component; (d) the methodologies and&#13;
procedures for enhancing local community and beneficiary participation with an emphasis on&#13;
information sharing and "Users Input" approaches in the selection, design, operation and maintenance&#13;
of investment schemes, and in (e) improving maintenance systems. The project will also develop the&#13;
capability of local contractors through training in technical and management aspects of contracting,&#13;
prompt payment of bills, progressive introduction of larger construction contracts, and measures to&#13;
encourage contractor-ownership of construction equipment.  It will also support NGOs active in&#13;
improving the country boats operations in the informal sector, in extending information-sharing, safety&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
education and training. The experience gained in Socio-economic monitoring and evaluation (SEM&amp;E)&#13;
of the project effects under RRMIMP-1, would be further harmonized in order to develop better rural&#13;
investment planning and policy making. Technical assistance will be provided through consultants&#13;
(local and foreign) as part of Design, Supervision and Monitoring (DSM) consultants, and as additional&#13;
specialists, and through training programs (internal and external). Further details are given in Annex&#13;
2.6. The training program will be reviewed during negotiations, which will be subjected to annual&#13;
review before March 31 each year.&#13;
2.33   The project will support LGED efforts in its capacity building, and based on the MANCAPS&#13;
recommendations (para. 1.42), the project would finance seven incremental high level staff positions&#13;
given in (Annex 1.2), which have been found necessary to implement project activities and will form&#13;
part of LGED's subsequently reorganized establishment. Agreement was reached during negotiations&#13;
that LGED will fill these positions by December 31, 1996, and GOB would fund these seven positions&#13;
from the revenue budget from the fifth year of the proiect (2000-2001) onwards. Agreement was&#13;
reached with GOB that it would implement the MANCAPS (see para. 1.41) recommendations on: (i)&#13;
improved financial management and internal auditing: (ii) reduction of span of control through more&#13;
delegation of responsibilities, and creation of 6 regional offices headed by Superintending Engineer&#13;
before March 31. 1997. The other details including MANCAPS recommendations and proposed&#13;
organization chart for the management strengthening of LGED are given in Annex 1.2.&#13;
2.34   Technical Assistance (Policy Support): It is proposed to carry out the following studies on:&#13;
(a) long-term socio-economic impact to evaluate and quantify the impacts of rural infrastructure&#13;
investment in the project area on the transport and trading system, on economic and social&#13;
development, and on poverty alleviation (which will supplement traffic impact studies carried out as&#13;
part of SEM&amp;E (see para. 1.53)); (b) small scale contracting industry to develop a better understanding&#13;
of its financial, management and operating characteristics and of the constraints to its development; (c)&#13;
study of pavement behavior of various trial sections constructed on FRB roads under the project; (d)&#13;
road construction contractor unit costs to develop competitive unit cost rates for different construction&#13;
activities; (e) Feeder Roads Regional prioritization study to define guidelines for the prioritization of&#13;
FRBs rural roads and markets improvements and for reviewing roads classification; (f) financial&#13;
resource mobilization of local bodies; (g) financial audit studies; and (h) technical audit studies. The&#13;
outline TOR for the proposed studies is shown in Annex 2.7, with details in PID; these were reviewed&#13;
and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
2.35   Development of Small Scale Construction Industry: LGED implements a large number of&#13;
construction schemes including rural roads, structures and markets through award of contracts. The&#13;
capacity of local construction industry largely consisting of petty contractors, is severely constrained&#13;
on account of lack of contractor's owned construction equipment (rollers and trucks), training in&#13;
contract procedures and management, and weak credit worthiness for receiving mobilization advances&#13;
from LGED. Limited construction season, generally December to May, is another key factor which&#13;
discourages the small contractors from buying construction equipment. In order to keep the contract&#13;
size within the capacity of local contractors, and to help train them, LGED has been awarding&#13;
contracts of smaller size (2-3 km with contract value not more than US$100,000) with the time limit of&#13;
one construction season, and has also been giving their equipment on rent. The proposed project&#13;
would encourage to enlarge the size of contracts by extending the time limit into two construction&#13;
seasons. To strengthen the capability of local construction industry, the project will initiate several&#13;
next steps including: (a) improving technical and management capacity of small contractors through&#13;
training; (b) financing of equipment for leasing to contractors at commercial rates; (c) encouraging the&#13;
contractors to own low-cost locally made construction equipment; (d) progressive increase in the size&#13;
of contracts. To review these initiatives systematically, a study on small scale contracting industry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
(para. 2.34) has been proposed and based on its finding an action plan would be prepared to develop&#13;
the existing construction industry in Bangladesh.&#13;
2.36   Promotion of Private Sector: To promote private sector participation, Working Committee&#13;
consisting of representatives from LGED, RHD, Ministry of Industry, Bangladesh University of&#13;
Engineering and Technology (BUET), Contractor's Association, leasing companies, and private&#13;
investors, would be created. This committee would help information sharing regarding future road&#13;
investments and private sector's role and growth potential in road sub-sector industries. It is expected&#13;
that the committee could speed up the introduction of plant hire pools for the small contractors, the&#13;
production of bitumen emulsions and the manufacturing of precast concrete units for the construction&#13;
of drainage structures on rural roads. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the GOB would&#13;
create a Working Committee with representatives from private and public sectors, for promoting&#13;
private sector in the rural infrastructure sector before March 31. 1997, and would make best efforts to&#13;
implement its recommendations.&#13;
2.37   The project will support improved co-ordination and co-operation between the LGED and the&#13;
RHD. Possible areas for co-ordination and co-operation are: (a) training of engineers, technicians and&#13;
small contractors; (b) promotion of a consistent maintenance approach with increased participation of&#13;
road users and clear assignment of responsibilities; (c) selection criteria for upgrading and&#13;
improvement and FRB and FRA roads; (d) standard design and specifications for road pavements and&#13;
drainage structures; (e) information sharing on the performance of pavement trial sections; (f) quality&#13;
control procedures, development of construction equipment, rental charges for plant and equipment,&#13;
and unit rates for construction cost estimates.  IDA will promote such cooperation through its&#13;
continued project involvement with both LGED and RHD.&#13;
(i)   Implementation Support: (Base cost US$14.92 million)&#13;
2.38   Given LGED has sufficient experience in implementation of similar rural development projects&#13;
and performance of the RRMIMP-1 is quiet satisfactory, LGED can well handle the implementation of&#13;
the proposed project on its own. However, for the major project components especially improving&#13;
FRB roads and construction of structures on rural roads, where the quality control is a matter of&#13;
concern, the project would strengthen the institutional capacity of the Project Implementation Office&#13;
(PIO) by financing DSM consultant services, incremental staff positions and the urgently needed&#13;
operating costs following similar arrangements under RRMIMP-1. The proposed implementation&#13;
support would ensure the timely completion of all project components, will build institutional capacity&#13;
and technical capability of LGED in the planning and management of RDPs. The project will include:&#13;
(a)   Incremental staff and Operating Costs: (US$3.82 million). The project will finance&#13;
incremental staff positions and operating costs  for project implementation, but&#13;
excluding staff whose costs can be recovered from fees and charges, e.g. equipment&#13;
operators. It will include 394 staffing positions or about 1961 person-year. Annex 3.2&#13;
provides more details of project incremental staffing.  LGED's established staff&#13;
strength cannot handle many additional tasks related to the project; these staff&#13;
requirements were estimated after using private sector consultants to the extent&#13;
feasible.&#13;
(b)    Design. Supervision and Monitoring (DSM): (US$10.59 million) The project will&#13;
finance DSM consultant services. The DSM consultants will be responsible for&#13;
engineering design and checking of supervision including signing certificates of&#13;
payment and disbursement; will assist LGED in project planning, contracting,&#13;
implementation, training, monitoring (including SEM&amp;E) and reporting; and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
provide technical assistance on different aspects of the project, including TA in setting&#13;
up a maintenance management system in the project area. It is estimated that about&#13;
3,376 professional staff months of constancy services will be required including 220&#13;
staff months of international consultants. The Terms of Reference for the DSM&#13;
consultants are in PID-6.&#13;
E. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
2.39   The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is estimated at US$192.36&#13;
million, of which the foreign exchange component is US$46.22 million (24%). Duties and taxes are&#13;
estimated at US$13.49 million. Physical contingencies are estimated at 5-10% for civil works, 10%&#13;
for equipment and, because of uncertainties about market values of land, 25% for land acquisition.&#13;
Price contingencies and foreign exchange rates are estimated on the basis of expected rates of local and&#13;
foreign inflation. Local inflation is estimated at rates ranging from 2.5% per annum during the first&#13;
year and 4.5% during the remaining period, while foreign inflation is estimated at 2.5% per annum. It&#13;
is assumed that exchange rate adjustments would, on average, maintain purchasing power parity during&#13;
the project implementation period. The project cost is summarized in Table 2.1 below and details are&#13;
in Annex 2.9.&#13;

2.40   Project cost estimates are based on consultant's preliminary design and are derived from: (a)&#13;
proposed design standards, and costs of recently awarded contracts for similar works and current&#13;
LGED unit cost rates; (b) preliminary survey of market prices for land; (c) inquiries on current prices&#13;
of equipment in Bangladesh and costs of recently procured equipment on similar projects; (d)&#13;
prevailing staff costs; and (e) prevailing fees for consultants on rural infrastructure projects in&#13;
Bangladesh. Duties and taxes are estimated at 7% of gross cost of civil works executed by contractors,&#13;
13% of the cost of locally procured equipment, and 45% of the cost of imported equipment and 75%&#13;
for imported four-wheel-drive vehicles.&#13;
F. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
2.41   The project would be financed by IDA, SDC, GOB and UPs. The overall financing plan is:&#13;
IDA credit US$133.00 million (69% of the total cost); SDC grant US$15.00 million (8% of the total&#13;
cost); GOB, US$36.42 million (19% of the total cost); and UPs, US$7.94 million (4% of the total&#13;
cost). The IDA credit would cover: 80% cost of the civil works (FRB, SRR, growth center markets&#13;
and river jetties); 100% cost of equipment excluding taxes; 100% cost of technical assistance (policy&#13;
support); 14% cost of the project implementation support; 14% cost of pilot program to improve&#13;
NMT; and average of 50% of the periodic maintenance on FRB roads in the project area on a&#13;
declining scale (para. 2.15). The SDC grant of US$15 million would be under joint financing&#13;
arrangements, which means that IDA procurement procedures will be applicable to the total project.&#13;
SDC participated in the IDA-GOB credit negotiations, and has subsequently signed its Grant&#13;
Agreement with GOB. SDC and IDA would sign a trust-fund agreement covering joint-financing&#13;
arrangements. SDC Grant would cover: 100% cost of the training and study tours; 86% cost of the&#13;
pilot program of NMT; 86% cost of DSM and audit services; and 66% cost of the incremental staff&#13;
and operating costs. Project cost estimates and financing plan were reviewed during negotiations.&#13;
Fulfilling the conditions of effectiveness of the cofinancing agreement between GOB and SDC (other&#13;
than those related to the effectiveness of the GOB-IDA credit agreement) would be a condition of IDA&#13;
credit effectiveness. Table 2.2 summarizes the project financing plan by components.&#13;
2.42   The Government counterpart resources would finance : 100%  cost of the land acquisition;&#13;
average of 50% of the periodic maintenance in the project area; 20% cost of civil works (FRB); 10%&#13;
cost of Structures of Rural Roads (SRRs) (only for the first three years); 10% cost of the growth&#13;
center markets and river jetties; 20% of the incremental project staff and operating costs; and all costs&#13;
(US$13.79 million) in taxes and duties. The UPs will finance 10-20% of the cost of SRRs (10% in the&#13;
first three years and 20% in the last two years); 10% of the cost of the growth center markets, and&#13;
river jetties. These local contributions are detailed in Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.43 One of the main financial issues affecting the project would be that the UPs, which are the&#13;
lowest level elected Government in the country have a weak financial basis, and are unable to find&#13;
adequate funding for maintaining the infrastructure under their jurisdiction on a sustainable basis and&#13;
for constructing essential drainage structures to fill gaps on their roads.  The project proposes&#13;
measures to partly improve this situation (see para. 1.35).&#13;

G. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
2.44   The LGED has prepared the project in the light of its considerable past experience, with&#13;
assistance from international and local consultants, and in partnership with the IDA and the SDC. The&#13;
main project components (roads, markets, ghats) have been selected following an intensive process&#13;
involving beneficiary participation, subject to possible essential changes in future; for smaller&#13;
components (rural structures etc.) selection process will start following credit approval.  Out of the&#13;
list of FRB roads selected for improvement under the project, five roads in Greater Dhaka Area (41&#13;
hcm) have already been tendered under retroactive financing (para. 3.21) and work started in January&#13;
1996. Supervision consultants for this part of the work have also been appointed following IDA&#13;
procedures.&#13;
2.45   Engineering designs of FRB roads, markets and ghats proposed for implementation in 1996/97&#13;
(first year) have been completed, and contracts for most first year works, particularly for FRB roads,&#13;
have already been awarded. Further preparatory work, including preparation of the engineering&#13;
designs and bidding documents for second year (1997-98) FRB roads, markets and ghats, is in an&#13;
advanced stage and would be completed by end of January 1997. LGED has appointed DSM&#13;
Consultants in November 1996, following IDA guidelines. LGED has already appointed Project&#13;
Director and other key staff of the Project Implementation Office (PIO). Work on designing markets&#13;
with community iilputs is in progress with assistance of preparation consultants, and has been&#13;
completed for about eighteen markets. Process of selecting NGOs for further NMT component has&#13;
been started and will be completed soon after IDA credit approval. The Land Acquisition Action Plan&#13;
(para. 3.28), and the Sector Environmental Assessment (para. 3.29) for the related civil works have&#13;
been prepared in accordance with IDA guidelines and have been agreed during negotiations.&#13;
2.46   Considerable preparation for the component of SRR component has been completed including&#13;
the agreement on participatory procedures in consultation with the local bodies, UPs, TDCC and the&#13;
local communities. The actual physical work on this component will start only after the project&#13;
approval, since the local bodies who are required to put up initial deposit to signal their participation&#13;
in this component, need confirmation on project funding from IDA. The low-cost engineering design&#13;
for all sizes of structures have already been developed under RRMIMP-1 and it will take only about&#13;
two days for LGED field engineers to finalize the design after site selection is done by local&#13;
communities. About 1200 similar structures have already been constructed under RRMIMP-1, and the&#13;
experience shows that this component would move expeditiously. The UP chairpersons have shown&#13;
enthusiastic support for this component and have indicated that if each UP goes for two structures, the&#13;
proposed 6,000 structures would be fully committed early in the project cycle. Since these are several&#13;
separate contracts to be executed under the supervision of LGED Thana Engineers, contracts in the&#13;
different locations can move simultaneously. The procurement and account-keeping arrangements&#13;
acceptable to IDA for small structures have already been established under RRMIMP-1 and would be&#13;
followed under the proposed project. To increase public awareness of this nationwide component and&#13;
to encourage local community to prepare for active participation in it, the LGED has already launched&#13;
public campaign through the media and other channels. Given the innovative features introduced on&#13;
participatory process for the structure's site selection and the requirement of an initial deposit by UPs,&#13;
it is likely that the physical progress of this component may be slow during the first year, but should&#13;
gain momentum in the subsequent years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. AN OVERVIEW OF THE PARTICIPATORY PROCESS&#13;
3.1    The project is considered by IDA as a "flagship" operation in using participatory approach in&#13;
view of its emphasis on using borrower and beneficiary participation in the selection, design and&#13;
implementation of the project. The participatory approach was emphasized right from the start of&#13;
project preparation by organizing several participatory meetings with 'users', rural communities,&#13;
beneficiaries,  local government and the related government and non-government organizations.&#13;
Locations of main project components (roads, river jetties, markets), have been selected using active&#13;
involvement of beneficiaries. Rural structures (SRR costing more than 35% of the project costs), will&#13;
be selected using specially designed participatory processes agreed during negotiations (see Annex&#13;
2.1). The local bodies (UPs) will put 10-20% (para.2.42) of the structure costs up-front to signal&#13;
their financial stake. Actual selection of the structures will be done through a participatory process&#13;
involving two stages: (i) selection by UP residents through group meetings for discussing alternatives&#13;
using user-inputs techniques (such as, map-making etc.), most likely with assistance of LGED's&#13;
community organizers and the projects' participation facilitators (which assistance may not be available&#13;
in all cases); and (ii) voting by UP council on the proposed sites (see para. 2.17). Road designs take&#13;
into account user preferences, particularly, concerns of NMT operators who are major users. In the&#13;
case of growth center markets, the design and layout of facilities is being done in full day meetings&#13;
with poor vendors and others who would be the main users of these market facilities; they will also be&#13;
given a key role in managing the markets (regarding level of user charges, auctioning of market lease,&#13;
maintenance arrangements and funding), through market committees of users, reporting every six&#13;
months to an "assembly" of market users, with special emphasis on information sharing. Similarly,&#13;
country boat operators and other user groups will be actively involved in Ghat selection, design and&#13;
management. For road components, user committees will be set up to give feed back on design and&#13;
quality of on-going works. LGED will also initiate pilot programs in at least two districts to try out&#13;
new ways for greater community involvement in road maintenance.  Many of the participatory&#13;
processes used are based on lessons learned from different pilot programs undertaken in Bangladesh in&#13;
which LGED has been involved.&#13;
3.2    To ensure the participatory process to be more transparent and well implemented, the project&#13;
would finance 17 positions of local specialists in community participation (sociologists or equivalent)&#13;
and one expatriate expert with local experience; of these one community specialist will be placed in&#13;
each project district, and three community specialists (supervisors) will be assigned to advise and&#13;
assist the Project Director and LGED headquarters. In addition, suitable LGED personnel at Thana&#13;
level will be trained as "community organizers;" LGED already trained and appointed 10 community&#13;
organizers with effect from February 1996. Project implementation actions (para. 2.12. Annex 2.1)&#13;
include appointment by LGED of 17 qualified community specialists before March 31, 1997: eight of&#13;
them have been appointed, as an advance measure agreed during negotiations. In addition, LGED&#13;
would set up, before December 31, 1997, District level Road User Committees in the project area&#13;
which would include representatives from different user groups and will promote information sharing&#13;
and selection of priorities, and facilitate feedback from users on quality of on-going works.&#13;
3.3    The participation specialists will also assist poor workers and destitute women to organize&#13;
labor contracting societies (to work as contractors in labor based road works and road maintenance) in&#13;
two pilot districts, with the help of NGOs. UP's financial position will be strengthened under the&#13;
project (para. 1.35) so that they can effectively participate in their infrastructure maintenance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
improvements. Professional participation facilitators will help implement many aspects of the project,&#13;
and will also help create a participatory institutional system for future projects. The project agency&#13;
(LGED) is fully committed to promoting local participation in projects, and has good track record in&#13;
working closely with local communities; overall, the project will strive hard to promote effective local&#13;
participation in the design and implementation of rural infrastructure projects, and more importantly&#13;
promote a sense of community ownership of rural infrastructure.  Further details of community&#13;
participation in rural infrastructure development under the project are given in Annex 2.3.&#13;
3.4    The project emphasizes participation of women, who would be some of the main project&#13;
beneficiaries in receiving and in getting better facilities as market vendors and users. To increase&#13;
participation of women, as part of project implementation actions (see para. 2.14 and Annex 2.1),&#13;
LGED would nominate one of its senior staff (the sociologist in the LGED headquarter's office&#13;
provided as incremental staff) to look after gender issues. LGED would also recruit more women&#13;
engineers as its staff (it has currently only 30 women engineers out of total engineering staff of about&#13;
700), and would give special emphasis to the training of the women members of UPs under its&#13;
participation training programs under the project so as to strengthen their role in local development&#13;
matters. LGED/UPs will also help increase the number of women members in the market and ghat&#13;
user committees. The participatory procedures agreed with GOB (para. 2.12 and Annex 2.1) include&#13;
these actions.&#13;
3.5    The project components have been agreed with the government after extensive deliberations&#13;
with the concerned agencies and main user groups. LGED deputed three high level staff to participate&#13;
in the pre-appraisal and appraisal teams. In addition, two local consultants with specialized knowledge&#13;
on participation also contributed in designing participatory process.&#13;
B. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.6    LGED, a well established department with a proven record on implementation of similar rural&#13;
roads and market improvement projects. Following the successful model of RRMIMP-1 a separate&#13;
Project Implementation Office (PIO) with full-time Project Director (PD) who reports to the Chief&#13;
Engineer, LGED has recently been established with its headquarters in Dhaka. The PD will be&#13;
responsible for: (a)  rural infrastructure components of the project; (b) selected Institutional and&#13;
Human Resource Development sub-components which are specific to the project area; (c) procurement&#13;
of equipment and goods; (d) management of the DSM consultants; and (e) financial management and&#13;
reporting. The Additional Chief Engineer (Design, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation) will be&#13;
responsible for: (a) the implementation of the Institutional and Human Resource Development sub-&#13;
components which focus on LGED as an organization and/or have a nationwide perspective; and (b)&#13;
the pilot program to improve NMT; and (c) the development of low-cost, appropriate construction&#13;
equipment. The project management organogram, and the division of responsibilities between the PD&#13;
and the ACE, are detailed in Annex 3.1.&#13;
3.7    The PIO will work directly with the offices of the LGED Executive Engineers in the 14 project&#13;
Districts and, through them with the offices of the Thana Engineers. At headquarters, the PD will be&#13;
assisted by two Deputy Project Directors (DPD): one DPD will head a Unit to look after the project&#13;
components in the Greater Dhaka area; and the second DPD will manage project activities related to&#13;
the SRR which is national in scope. One senior engineer will be in charge of performance reporting.&#13;
To strengthen technical, managerial and administrative capacity,  the PIO  incremental staff at&#13;
headquarters will include one Economist to undertake the SEM&amp;E work and two Sociologists (one of&#13;
them for SRR follow-up) to work on participatory aspects of the project. The incremental staffing at&#13;
District level will include one Sociologist per District to provide additional capacity on land acquisition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
and participatory aspects of the project. LGED has already appointed Project Director and other key&#13;
staff of PIO in October 1996. as agreed during nezotiations.&#13;
3.8   Defects Liability Period of Last Year's works: In view of the 5-year implementation period and&#13;
since no foreign contractors are likely to be involved in the project works, it has been agreed that the&#13;
one year guaranteed maintenance period (defects liability period) of the last year's contract will be&#13;
monitored by LGED; the retention money for this maintenance period will be retained by LGED (from&#13;
the Government's 20% contribution) in a separate account and paid to the contractors on due&#13;
completion. This arrangement will be confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.9   The project will be implemented over a period of about 57 months between Board date and&#13;
Project Completion date (December 1996 to September 2001); Credit closing date will be March 31,&#13;
2002.  The proposed implementation schedule is shown in Annex 3.4; this was agreed during&#13;
negotiations. For the civil work components the peak level of construction activity is scheduled for the&#13;
years 2, 3 and 4 with a minimum level of activity in the year 5.&#13;
3.10   Equipment will be procured in two phases: (a) first phase in 1996/97 to equip the PIO and the&#13;
five 'new' Districts that have not previously benefited from an RDP; (b) second phase in 1998/99 to&#13;
replace existing equipment at District level that has reached the end of its useful working life. The low-&#13;
cost, appropriate construction equipment will be developed in the early stages of the project so that it&#13;
can be tested in selected Districts in 1997/98 and introduced to all Districts in 1998/99. The impact&#13;
study will be carried out in three phases: (a) to collect baseline data; (b) to examine short-term effects&#13;
of infrastructure improvements; and (c) to examine longer-term socio-economic impacts - starting in&#13;
early 1997 and ending in end-2001. Technical assistance studies will be carried out in the first half of&#13;
the project period so that their findings can be applied during the project period.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.11   Procurement of civil works and goods under the project will be in accordance with World&#13;
Bank Procurement Guidelines. Table 3.1 summarizes the procurement arrangements for the project.&#13;
The procurement plan for civil works packages appears in Annex 3.5.&#13;

3.12   Civil Works: In view of small size of contracts scattered over a large area, civil works for the&#13;
improvement and upgrading of FRB roads, for construction of FRB structures, for periodic&#13;
maintenance of roads, for construction of structures on rural roads (SRRs), for improvement of&#13;
markets, for rehabilitation/construction of ghats and for the construction of the LGED Dhaka District&#13;
office are expected to be procured on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures&#13;
which do not preclude international participation, using the latest Bank's Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
(SBD) for Procurement of Smaller Contracts. The individual value of these contracts will not exceed&#13;
US$1.5 million equivalent, and their aggregate value will not exceed US$148 million equivalent. All&#13;
civil works contracts with individual value exceeding US$1.5 million equivalent will be procured&#13;
under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) following IDA Guidelines. Prequalification of&#13;
contractors for inclusion in a roster for the works will be completed in accordance with&#13;
prequalification procedures agreed with the World Bank prior to project-start, and the prequalification&#13;
will be updated mid-way through the project period. Contract awards for all works estimated to cost&#13;
more than US$200,000 equivalent (some 60 contracts) will require IDA's prior review and approval.&#13;
About 30% of the total estimated civil works and goods procurement would be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review; post review would be undertaken of the remainder.&#13;
3.13   For the early implementation of FRB works in the Greater Dhaka Area in 1995/96, estimated&#13;
to cost US$3.0 million, pre-qualified contractors under the ongoing IDA financed RRMIMP-1, RDP-6&#13;
and RDP-14, together with LGED licensed Special Category contractors in the five concerned&#13;
Districts, will be allowed to bid for contracts, but will be eligible for awards only up to the value of&#13;
works for which they are pre-qualified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
3.14   Because of the social objectives of the project, which encourage involvement of labor&#13;
contracting societies (LCS) set up by landless laborers and destitute women, small work contracts for&#13;
tree plantation and care-taking on project FRBs will be procured by direct, annual contract with groups&#13;
of disadvantaged women and laborers at fixed payment rates. Also, some SRR works for installation&#13;
of pipe culverts, including production of the pipes, estimated to cost up to US$8,000 each, will also be&#13;
procured by direct negotiated contract with LCS and other organized labor groups at fixed payment&#13;
rates based on the prevalent rates for works. Similarly, ancillary earthworks for the SRR component&#13;
will be procured by direct contract with LCS and/or organized labor groups, and by casual&#13;
employment of laborers at agreed daily rates. Contract documents for procurement of these works will&#13;
be based on existing LGED procedures, acceptable to the Association; LGED has sound procedures for&#13;
such contracts, and performance will be closely monitored by DSM consultants and technical auditors&#13;
(para. 3.25). All these direct contracts for small works will not exceed cumulatively US$10 million;&#13;
their individual contract value will not exceed US$10,000 equivalent.&#13;
3.15   Equipment and Goods: Imported equipment and goods will be procured by International&#13;
Competitive Bidding using the World Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Goods,&#13;
except that minor items or groups of items estimated to cost less than US$200,000 will be procured on&#13;
the basis of national competitive bidding within an aggregate value of US$5 million. Procurement of&#13;
equipment and goods, with items or groups of items estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent,&#13;
upto an aggregate value of US$1 million, will be procured by local shopping. This will include the&#13;
procurement of production batches of appropriate, low-cost construction equipment and improved&#13;
NMT vehicles.&#13;
3.16   Contracts for procurement of equipment and goods and works with a value of over&#13;
US$200,000, and the first two NCB contracts for works, will be subject to IDA's prior review and&#13;
approval. Procurement of construction equipment and vehicles shall be made with due consideration, in&#13;
the preparation of procurement documents and the evaluation of bids, of (a) necessary quality and&#13;
durability; (b) the standardization of the LGED equipment and vehicle fleet; and (c) the availability in&#13;
Bangladesh of reliable spare parts supply and maintenance support service.&#13;
3.17   Consultancy services and technical assistance: under the project will be procured in accordance&#13;
with principles and procedures satisfactory to the IDA, based on the Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and The World Bank as Executive Agency (August 1981). The&#13;
Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultant's Services for Time-Based Assignments (June 1995)&#13;
will be used for consultancy contracts. The proposed consultancy services under the project would&#13;
involve contracts of the following sizes: one costing around US$10 million; one costing around&#13;
US$1.5 million equivalent, and about ten costing less than US$0.5 million equivalent each. The short-&#13;
list, terms of reference, final selection and contract of the DSM consultants, the private auditing firm&#13;
and the consultants for the preparation of the follow-up project will be subject to review and approval&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;
3.18   Consultant services for the conduct of the Impact Study (approximate cost US$0.4 million) will&#13;
be procured by direct negotiated contract with a premier economic research institute in Bangladesh&#13;
with considerable international recognition. This is essential for continuity of the impact study work&#13;
from that which is already being carried out by this institute (Bangladesh Institute of Development&#13;
Studies (BIDS)) under RRMIMP-1, and because of their specialized expertise. The terms of reference&#13;
and the contract for the study are subject to review and approval of the IDA. The services of suitable&#13;
NGO's under sub-contract to LGED to execute the Pilot Program to Improve NMT and for building up&#13;
labor contracting societies and other participatory processes, estimated to cost a total of US$1.0&#13;
million, will be procured by invitation and evaluation of proposals from selected NGOs and/or&#13;
consortia of NGOs who have been identified as having the necessary capabilities to undertake the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
work. The terms of reference, evaluation and contract will be subject to review and approval by the&#13;
IDA. Small contracts for other studies and technical assistance services will be allowed under&#13;
negotiated contracts subject to IDA's approval. All consultancy contracts with an individual value of&#13;
over US$50,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA's prior review and approval.&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.19   Disbursements under the proposed credit and SDC funds will be made as indicated in Table&#13;
3.2 below. The project Implementation Office (PIO) will prepare all withdrawal applications. Full&#13;
documentation will be sent to the IDA in support of withdrawal applications except for (a) civil works&#13;
and goods contracts awarded under national competitive bidding procedures costing less than the&#13;
equivalent of US$200,000 each; (b) civil works let by direct contracts to labor groups or through the&#13;
Union Parishad, i.e. tree plantation on FRBs and installation of culverts and ancillary earthworks on&#13;
Rural Roads; (c) consultants contracts costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each; and (d)&#13;
expenditures on training, incremental staff and operating costs. Withdrawal applications for such&#13;
expenditures will be supported by certified Statements of Expenditure (SOE), the documentation for&#13;
which would not be submitted to IDA but retained by the PIO and made available for review during&#13;
the course of project supervision. It is estimated that about US$70 million equivalent would be&#13;
disbursed through SOEs. All withdrawal applications in respect of civil works apart from SRRs and&#13;
ancillary earthworks will be accompanied by certificates from the DSM consultants attesting that the&#13;
works concerned are consistent with the sub-component selection criteria, that the works and materials&#13;
meet the design standards and specifications agreed by IDA, and that payments are in accordance with&#13;
the works completed. For the SRRs and ancillary earthworks the DSM consultants will annually&#13;
inspect all works after completion and certify that they comply with the selection criteria, that they&#13;
conform to the agreed technical standards, and that payments which have been made are consistent&#13;
with the completed works. Accredited private auditors will conduct financial and performance audit&#13;
including sample checking of payment certificates and progress reports by field verification. The&#13;
technical and financial audit (see para. 3.25) will have a special focus on reviewing expenditures&#13;
through SOEs.&#13;
3.20   Disbursements will occur over a five-year period compared with the 7.5 year standard&#13;
disbursement profile for Bank funded road projects. The estimated disbursement schedule is given in&#13;
Annex 3.6. Civil works are expected to be completed by September 30, 2001, and, with allowance for&#13;
six months for final disbursements, the Credit closing date will be March 31, 2002. The Mid-Term&#13;
Review will provide an opportunity to adjust the quantum of works under different categories to reflect&#13;
implementation capacity as judged from experience in the first half of the project period.&#13;
3.21   Retroactive financing and special account: To expedite early start up, IDA would retroactively&#13;
finance some urgently needed road works under the project, which were agreed in principle during&#13;
appraisal and on which expenditure was incurred after January 1, 1996, provided IDA procurement&#13;
procedures and land acquisition guidelines are followed strictly, and the implementation and civil&#13;
works have been adequately supervised and the payments have been properly certified by the&#13;
consultants acceptable to IDA. Some retroactive financing for consultancy services (supervision and&#13;
impact studies, surveys for fixing bench marks) has also been agreed. The total limit for retroactive&#13;
financing would be US$3.5 million. To facilitate timely payment of project expenditures, and to avoid&#13;
payment delays to the small contractors, a Special Account amounting to US$10.0 million (equal to&#13;
four months' average disbursement) would be established at the Bangladesh Bank in Dhaka. IDA&#13;
would provide an initial Special Account deposit of US$6.0 million; the Borrower would receive the&#13;
full authorized Special Account allocation of US$10.0 million, when aggregate amount of withdrawals&#13;
from the Credit Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments shall be equal to&#13;
the equivalent of SDR 15.0 million.&#13;

43&#13;
F. REPORTING&#13;
3.22   LGED would prepare, with the assistance of the DSM consultants, quarterly progress reports&#13;
covering all components of the project and other pertinent information as required. LGED would&#13;
submit to IDA: (a) quarterly report within one month of the end of each quarter; and (b)&#13;
implementation completion report in accordance with IDA guidelines. These reports will include: (a)&#13;
progress achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules, and key monitoring&#13;
performance indicators; (b) work program and cost estimates for the coming quarter and for the total&#13;
project. LGED will also prepare an Implementation Completion Report in accordance with IDA&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
3.23   Mid-term Review: To examine project progress, IDA and GOB would carry out a mid-term&#13;
review before the end of third year (allowing completion of fair-weather season for works). PIO and&#13;
LGED would organize the review and prepare terms of reference in consultation with IDA. During the&#13;
review the compliance to covenants and performance standards and item wise implementation progress,&#13;
against original targets will be closely assessed; based on careful review of progress and possible&#13;
future slippage, if likely, the project could be restructured if considered necessary by IDA. The review&#13;
would focus on: (a) overall progress achieved both in terms of physical and financial targets and key&#13;
indicators for the evaluation of development impact; (b) value of contracts issued as against targets,&#13;
and likely programs for issuing, completing new contracts; (c) progress in implementing individual&#13;
components, particularly the component of SRR, NMT and maintenance; (d) progress in promoting&#13;
participatory approach in the planning and implementation of civil works; (e) improvement in the&#13;
financial position of local government (UPs); (f) LGED institutional strengthening; (g) contractor's&#13;
performance and growth; and (h) equipment management procedures; revision of rental charges and&#13;
cost accounting system. The mid-term review of the project would be completed by October 31, 1999.&#13;
G. ACCOUNTS&#13;
3.24   LGED would maintain adequate records, in line with guidelines on financial reporting and&#13;
auditing of IDA projects, to identify physical progress and financial transactions.  Individually&#13;
identifiable accounts would also be kept for: (a) all expenditure for which credit withdrawals are made&#13;
on the basis of statement of expenditures (para. 3.19); and (b) the flow of funds from the Special&#13;
Account. The PIO will use the Financial Management System developed under RRMIMP-1 to record&#13;
details of all contracts including expenditures, and will collate the project accounts of LGED District&#13;
and Thana offices. The PIO will prepare consolidated statements for all project components and would&#13;
be responsible for maintaining project accounts and financial reports in accordance with IDA&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
H. FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL AUDITS&#13;
3.25   Financial Audit (once in a year) is required to ensure that: (a) Credit proceeds have been used&#13;
in accordance with the terms of Credit Agreement and solely for the project purposes; (b) civil works,&#13;
goods and services have been procured by the methods specified in the Credit Agreement; and (c) other&#13;
Credit Agreement provisions have been complied with satisfactorily. Accredited private auditors,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, will be appointed by LGD to carry out financial audit of the project. Performance&#13;
of auditing under the ongoing RRMIMP-1 has been satisfactory. In addition to the traditional financial&#13;
audit, the project will introduce technical audit to ensure adequate quality of civil works. Technical&#13;
Audit (twice in a year) will include on a sample basis the verification of actual work performed and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
quality as per approved specifications. Technical audits would be performed by the qualified&#13;
consultants acceptable to IDA and may be contracted as a part of the financial audit or separately.&#13;
Agreement was reached that the Financial Accounts and Audit Report will be sent to IDA not later&#13;
than nine months after the end of the Fiscal Year. and the six-monthly technical audit report not later&#13;
than three months after the end of each six-month period of works. The TORs for the financial and&#13;
technical audit services are given in PIDs 12 and 13.&#13;
I. MONITORING, SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION&#13;
3.26   Monitoring indicators have been developed in consultation with the LGED (Annex 3.7) to&#13;
show the progress with respect to physical and financial targets on each component. Time-bound&#13;
monitorable quantitative and qualitative targets have been designed to measure implementation success&#13;
and progress of project components. For evaluation of project objectives and development impact,&#13;
performance indicators have been proposed, which will show the status at project start and progress&#13;
achieved by mid-term review and project completion. In addition to normal SEM&amp;E studies and&#13;
surveys to assess impact of proposed project on traffic levels and transport costs, a larger socio-&#13;
economic impact study which will focus on distribution of project benefits and poverty impact, will be&#13;
carried out under the project (para. 2.34). All monitorable targets and performance indicators at the&#13;
sector level, project level and beneficiary level (shown in Annex 3.7) have been reviewed during&#13;
negotiations. The dispersed nature of the project, the involvement of different agencies, tiers of&#13;
government and communities and large number of small contracts would necessitate the use of&#13;
computerized project management (CPM) software (for example, see the output of software in Annex&#13;
3.4) for effective monitoring of project progress. LGED would make use of CPM (preferably&#13;
Microsoft Project software) for monitoring of project progress and in the preparation of quarterly&#13;
project reports, which would also summarize the activities of the past period, emerging problems and&#13;
issues, and recommendations for further steps.&#13;
3.27   Project supervision would be closely linked to the project objectives and the annual&#13;
implementation plans. It would involve monitoring a number of key indicators and assessing both&#13;
quality and quantity aspects of project implementation and their impact. In addition, the PIO would&#13;
oversee supervision of project activities to assess field implementation progress and problems,&#13;
involvement of beneficiary participation, and impact. The IDA would field normally two missions in a&#13;
year, each of about two or three weeks duration, to focus primarily on key implementation issues. The&#13;
first mission would concentrate on detailed review of the annual work plan at the onset of budget year;&#13;
the second would resolve problems, assess benefits, and draw lessons. The missions would review the&#13;
physical components of the project and the institutional and policy development measures proposed&#13;
under the project, and it would be done in the context of agreed targets. The LGED will co-ordinate&#13;
and provide all necessary information to these missions. Supervision between missions will be assisted&#13;
by the infrastructure unit in the Bank's Resident Mission. Main supervision missions (which are&#13;
expected to be two per year) will be done in coordination with SDC, which has agreed to actively&#13;
support project supervision. In case efforts of coordination in mission would result in timing conflict&#13;
between IDA and SDC, the mission timing proposed by IDA, the lead agency, would prevail.&#13;
J. LAND ACQUISITION&#13;
3.28   Most of the improvement works would be on existing alignments, with some additional land&#13;
needed for widening at a few points. Land acquisition of marginal pieces of land for feeder road&#13;
improvement will be needed (about 225 hectares, spread over about 575 km of roads in 14 districts;&#13;
this equates to about 0.4 ha of land per km of road, or strips of land 2.2 meter wide on either side of&#13;
the existing embankments). Rural families welcome proximity to an improved road as it gives better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
access, and increases land values. Affected households will lose narrow strip of land from their plots.&#13;
Arrangement for prior payments of compensation based on market rates, before work starts on any&#13;
land to be acquired, has been agreed. No resettlement is expected to be involved. If the land&#13;
acquisition reduces the home-stead plot to less than an agreed minimum size, the household will be&#13;
fully compensated for purchase of a replacement plot; the number of such cases would be small, and&#13;
their location cannot be identified until the land acquisition is under way for each road. In the unlikely&#13;
event that genuine squatters are found on any land to be acquired, contingency resettlement measures&#13;
have been agreed. IDA reviewed the Land Acquisition Action Plan (Annex 3.8) prepared by the&#13;
Government and it was substantially agreed. Agreement was reached during negotiation with&#13;
GOB/LGED on the Land Acquisition Action Plan including the following: (a) grievances procedures&#13;
including UP members in the process: (b) monitoring by LGED. and periodic performance evaluation&#13;
by an independent local individual or agency: and (c) acceptance in principle of resettlement&#13;
procedures for affected persons to be applied if needed. A major difficulty observed in processing the&#13;
land acquisition payment, is the time consuming bureaucratic procedure for according administrative&#13;
approval by LGD of the land proposed to be acquired. In order to expedite the processing of land&#13;
acquisition payments, it was agreed during negotiations that LGD would set up a commnittee headed by&#13;
a Deputv Secretary (who will directly report to the LGD Secretary) with representatives from LGED&#13;
before Board presentation, which will: (a) ensure that the Ministry's administrative approval is given&#13;
within seven days of request by LGED, (b) liaise with respective district commissioners to speed up&#13;
the process of land acquisition and compensation. and (c) ensure that LGED will report to IDA on&#13;
progress of land acquisition. This committee has been set up in October 1996.&#13;
K. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
3.29   An environmental analysis of the project was carried out by reviewing each project component&#13;
in accordance with Bank guidelines. Based on this analysis, the project was categorized as "B". The&#13;
project will have substantial positive environmental impact, and is not expected to have adverse impact&#13;
on the physical or ecological environment. No new road alignments are involved and the proposed&#13;
works are improvement, upgrading and maintenance of existing roads. The road works will have&#13;
positive environmental impacts - the provision of drainage structures will reduce water logging, the&#13;
bitumen surfacing will eliminate the dust hazard, the hard shoulders will improve safety, and trees will&#13;
be planted alongside all project roads.  The project will encourage the use of NMT which is&#13;
environmentally friendly. The physical environment, health standards and quality of life in the markets&#13;
and ghats will be improved through provision of clean, dry, free-draining areas, potable water supplies&#13;
and sanitation: bio-gas production from the garbage pits will be tried on a pilot basis in some market&#13;
improvement projects. Mitigation measures acceptable under IDA guidelines would be taken to avoid&#13;
any adverse environmental impact during project implementation. An environmental impact study and&#13;
Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) have been carried out by the LGED with the assistance of&#13;
consultants. The SEA, and the proposed mitigation measures, monitoring plan and recommended&#13;
actions have been reviewed with IDA, and are acceptable under IDA's Environmental Assessment&#13;
Guidelines. LGED has agreed to ensure: (a) adequate provisions for waste water and drainage facilities&#13;
in the design of rural markets and ghats; (b) the embankment slopes in the design of FRB and&#13;
structures, to maintain soil stability; and (c) erosion protection measures, where necessary. It was&#13;
agreed during negotiations that LGED will take actions in conformity with SEA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
4. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION &amp; RISKS&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC RETURN&#13;
Nature of project benefits&#13;
4.1    The project would benefit the project area through improvement in access and more efficient&#13;
marketing, and would also bring several other socio-economic benefits which are difficult to quantify.&#13;
The following discusses the general nature of benefits based on previous impact studies, and also&#13;
presents a partial economic return analysis of the proposed project based on easily quantifiable&#13;
benefits.&#13;
4.2    The critical importance of improving the condition of rural roads and markets in Bangladesh as&#13;
a way to improve rural income and reduce poverty has been recognized in the country's development&#13;
strategy.  The Rural Infrastructure Strategy study carried out by the IDA in collaboration with&#13;
GOB/LGED confirms that much of the rural road system, and most of the important markets, remain&#13;
in poor condition; it also found that investment on improving these facilities is essential to develop&#13;
rural economy and to reduce rural poverty, and recommends a larger investment program than&#13;
undertaken in the past decade. Recent IDA/GOB study on agricultural strategy also underlines the&#13;
need for improving rural infrastructure in support of agricultural diversification and growth, and&#13;
IDA's Country Assistance Strategy emphasizes rural transport development in view of its impact on&#13;
agriculture, rural economic growth, employment and poverty alleviation.&#13;
4.3    There is evidence to demonstrate the strong relationship between socio-economic well-being&#13;
and rural infrastructure supply, in the light of various studies in Bangladesh. Studies further show that&#13;
these investments benefit the rural poor more: the functionally landless and small farmers gained a&#13;
larger share of the increase from crops, wages, and livestock and fisheries, and there was a higher&#13;
proportion of employment of women.  Socio-economic monitoring and evaluation studies under&#13;
different LGED RDP projects show that improvement of FRBs produces a significant increase in non-&#13;
motorized and motorized transport services, a shift to more efficient transport modes, lower transport&#13;
costs for goods and passengers, a reduction in the dependence on travel by foot and head-porterage for&#13;
carrying of goods, and a substantial increase in traffic volumes, with overall improved access to goods&#13;
and to social services.  The same studies show that the improvement of rural market facilities,&#13;
combined with FRB improvements, leads to increases in throughput of goods, number of market&#13;
visitors, market turnover and market lease value, to reduced spoilage of goods, with the markets&#13;
developing into more efficient and hygienic trading centers for the poor farmers and vendors who are&#13;
their main users. More specifically, post appraisal of completed project components under the ongoing&#13;
RRMIMP-1 (RDP-7) show that traffic volumes in ton-km and passenger-km increased over 70% in&#13;
cargo and over 172 % in passenger traffic on the improved roads in the first year following&#13;
development, that bus services started for the first time on these roads which brought major benefits to&#13;
local people, and that partial quantified benefits from the project showed about 22% (range 14 - 45%)&#13;
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) from road investments and from market investments. Further,&#13;
estimates based on surveys of employment created under the completed rural infrastructure components&#13;
show, that on completion in 1997, these components, costing about US$64 million equivalent, would&#13;
have created: about 18,000 person-years of direct employment through labor-based construction&#13;
activities, and indirect employment at a rate of about 6000 person-years per year (in maintenance about&#13;
1000, and the rest in rickshaw-van and other transport operations, in markets, new road-side shops&#13;
etc.) which would be continued during the project life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
4.4    The Project Area: The Northwest Region remains economically and socially disadvantaged -&#13;
agricultural wage labor rates, GDP per capita, and male and female adult literacy rates are all below&#13;
the national average. Communications between the Northwest Region and the rest of the country will&#13;
be improved with the completion of the Jamuna Multi-Purpose Bridge; further development of the road&#13;
and market network will allow the area to exploit the economic opportunities that this will provide.&#13;
The rural Greater Dhaka Districts (except one) did not benefit from any RDPs, so far, and have severe&#13;
deficiencies in its rural transport and market infrastructure to serve its fast-growing high-price&#13;
horticultural crops which need timely transport and marketing; this area has higher population density&#13;
and higher traffic (NMT-dominated) than the North-West Region. Even after the completion of the&#13;
proposed project, both these areas would still meet only about 50-60% of the estimated current&#13;
requirements in infrastructure improvements.&#13;
Economic Return Analysis&#13;
4.5    The project's Economic Rate of Return (ERR) has been estimated based on quantifiable&#13;
benefits with reference to three main components: FRB road improvements, growth-center markets,&#13;
and Structures on Rural Roads (SRRs), as summarized below; a composite ERR for the project was&#13;
then estimated based on these three components.&#13;
4.6    FRB road improvements: The detailed analysis of economic costs and benefits of improvement&#13;
and upgrading of FRB roads, is given in PID-15. The analysis is at 1995 prices. The costs in the&#13;
economic analysis comprise the estimated investment in road improvement and upgrading and&#13;
construction of structures, land acquisition and tree plantation, routine and periodic maintenance over&#13;
the predicted 15 year life of the roads, and 7% of construction costs as an allowance for design and&#13;
supervision. Taxes, duties and contingencies are excluded. Costs of imported goods are taken at&#13;
border prices (cif prices), and the local costs are adjusted to border prices using a general conversion&#13;
factor of 0.9. Similar adjustments are also made for the value of benefits. The economic benefits&#13;
accrue to savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC). For vehicles, VOC savings are estimated from&#13;
input prices and cross-checked and verified against actual tariff charges in the rural transport market.&#13;
For non-motorized means of transport VOC savings are based on actual differentials in charges&#13;
between existing poor and improved roads, as they substantially reflect the cost variations due to&#13;
greater exertion and energy levels (food as fuel) needed for rougher roads, in the highly competitive&#13;
markets for these services. A good body of comparative data on these charges has been collected in&#13;
Bangladesh from past studies under ongoing projects and through surveys for the proposed project&#13;
which provide a consistent pattern of cost differences for different road conditions and vehicle types.&#13;
Impact studies on completed projects (see para. 1.49 and Annex 1.4) also show a consistent pattern of&#13;
changes in vehicle types as roads are improved, for example from walking to bicycles and buses, from&#13;
bullock carts to rickshaw vans and small trucks, etc. which provide reliable estimates of traffic pattern&#13;
and growth. Transport cost differences are estimated based on changes in modal-mix assumed based&#13;
on such information. Bench-mark traffic surveys have been made for all 69 roads selected for the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.7    Traffic growth has been estimated as follows: annual 8% for normal growth (about 1.5 times&#13;
the expected economic growth rate, based on available country-wide estimates); a generated traffic due&#13;
to road improvement using a price elasticity of demand for goods and passenger transport of -1 with&#13;
reference to transport cost reductions, and for diverted traffic based on the actual potential as assessed&#13;
through surveys as this varies from case to case. Overall , the traffic projected is very conservative&#13;
compared to actual growth recorded in the case of similar road improvements completed under the&#13;
IDA-SDC-KfW -supported RRMIMP-1, and under the GTZ - supported RDP-14, where traffic&#13;
increased steeply (motor vehicles and NMT vehicles by 160% and 146% respectively; passenger traffic&#13;
volume in passenger-kms by over 172% mainly because of starting of bus services, and cargo ton-kms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
by 70%) the pre-development level within about a year after road development; this shows that the&#13;
dynamism of economic and traffic growth is higher than conventionally assumed growth rates, and that&#13;
even as a road is improved (preceded by a long process of preparation and public awareness) change&#13;
begins to take place without much time-lags. The traffic assumptions made in this study lead to an&#13;
overall traffic growth of the following order for a typical road: total traffic increase (in ton-kmn and&#13;
passenger-kin) after three years after work completion (giving time for full generated traffic and traffic&#13;
diversion to come about) of about 55% in passenger and 104% in goods, the latter consisting of about&#13;
26%  normal growth in three years (at cumulative annual rate of 8%), 37% generated traffic (total one-&#13;
time growth spread over three years) and 41 % diverted traffic (total one-time growth); after the three&#13;
years, total traffic is assumed to increase at the normal growth rate of 8%. Compared to the post-&#13;
appraisal traffic growth rates noted above, these projections are very conservative, particularly for the&#13;
passenger traffic. The transport cost differences are estimated using changed modal mixes and costs,&#13;
following development, as discussed earlier, taking into account the characteristics of each road. Full&#13;
transport cost savings are included as project benefits for normal traffic growth, and only 50% savings&#13;
for generated and diverted traffic as well.&#13;
4.8    The economic rate of return on the investment in FRB improvement and upgrading, based on&#13;
the transport cost savings, is estimated as 30.4%. The flow of costs and benefits for a sample project&#13;
road, and other details of the analysis are presented in PID-15.&#13;
4.9    SRRs:  The main economic significance of SRR investment is that an investment of about&#13;
US$8,000 on an SRR will convert about 1.75 km of existing rural road (costing about US$70,000)&#13;
from a seasonal to all-season road. The economic analysis of the Structures on Rural Roads (SRR)&#13;
component (see PID-16) is based on a 'typical investment scheme to construct small structures on a&#13;
length of Rural Road in order to span two gaps and provide a continuous road alignment. The costs in&#13;
the analysis include the investment in the construction of the structures and the ancillary earthworks,&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance of the road and the structures over the predicted 15 year life, and 7%&#13;
of construction costs as an allowance for design and supervision. The benefits from the investment&#13;
have been derived based on field surveys of a sample of Rural Roads with and without gaps. These&#13;
show that the major benefit from providing continuous alignments is to eliminate the delays that occur,&#13;
particularly in the wet season, in crossing gaps or diverting to other, longer routes to avoid the gaps.&#13;
The spanning of the gaps will stimulate the growth of wheeled traffic and generate passenger and&#13;
goods movement on the road. The benefits are estimated as the time savings to normal and generated&#13;
traffic - pedestrians, passengers and vehicles - from eliminating the delays caused by gaps plus the&#13;
savings in ferry charges - 'informal' ferry services operate across some gaps during the wet season.&#13;
The base case economic rate of return for the SRR component, based on a 'typical' scheme is 30.2%.&#13;
The flow of costs and benefits for a typical SRR scheme is presented in PID-16. Nearly 30% of the&#13;
benefits accrue to the poorest beneficiaries, the pedestrians who continue to travel on foot after the&#13;
structures have been constructed because the cannot afford to use other means of transport.  The&#13;
component will benefit them in terms of better access to work, to markets and to social services.&#13;
4.10   The SRR component will comprise a large number of small investment schemes (each structure&#13;
(usually a culvert) costing about US$8,000 equivalent, with significant variability in the structures&#13;
required and the traffic volumes between individual schemes. Tests have therefore been carried out to&#13;
analyze the sensitivity of the rate of return to these variables. If the size of the structures required is&#13;
larger than in the typical scheme, costs will increase. A cost increase of 20% reduces the rate of&#13;
return to 25%, and a cost increase of 50% reduces it to 19%. Costs must increase by over 120% to&#13;
bring the rate of return down to 12 %. If traffic volume is less than in the typical scheme, benefits will&#13;
decrease. A decrease of 20% in traffic volume reduces the rate of return to 24%. A traffic volume&#13;
45%  of that on the 'typical' scheme is sufficient to give an economic rate of return of 12%. The&#13;
economic justification for the SRR component is therefore very robust.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
4.11   Growth Centre Markets: Many Growth Centre markets (public facilities for trading produce&#13;
and goods with basic facilities for cleanliness, drainage and paved areas partly under roof, each&#13;
costing about US$60,000 a piece) will be improved at the same time that the FRBs that serve them are&#13;
improved and upgraded; in some cases roads are already improved. It is therefore difficult to isolate&#13;
the respective contributions of the market investment and the road improvements. One benefit that is&#13;
specific to the market improvements is the reduction in spoilage of marketed produce. Because the&#13;
improved market is clean, and the produce is protected from the elements and sold more quickly,&#13;
spoilage losses for items such as rice, fish, meat, eggs, milk and vegetables are reduced.  The&#13;
economic analysis for market improvement (PID-17) is therefore based on the benefits from reduced&#13;
spoilage - this can be seen as a proxy for the increased profitability to sellers of produce directly due to&#13;
the market improvements. The costs included in the analysis are the investment in the improved&#13;
facilities, the routine and periodic maintenance over the assumed 15 year life of the market and 7% of&#13;
construction costs as an allowance for design and supervision. The RRMIMP SEM&amp;E studies show&#13;
that market improvements reduce spoilage losses by about 3 % of the value of the vulnerable produce.&#13;
Based on the characteristics of, and the volumes of goods sold in, the Growth Centre markets proposed&#13;
for improvement, a spoilage savings of 3% will generate an economic rate of return for the project&#13;
markets of 20.2%. The return is higher for large markets (25%) and lower for small markets (14%).&#13;
The flow of costs and benefits for a medium-sized market is presented in PID-17. These rates of&#13;
return are based on partial benefits since:&#13;
(a)   there are other economic benefits to market users, particularly the regular traders, from&#13;
the much more hygienic conditions in the improved markets; (the usually dirty and&#13;
stinking market areas where the poor vendors trade would turn into clean dry areas,&#13;
garbage giving place to clean bio-gas in some cases where small low-cost pilot&#13;
facilities will be installed for the purpose); moreover, new permanent private shops&#13;
open up around the public markets while existing shops expand, land values and rents&#13;
increase).&#13;
(b)   the integration of investments in improvement of markets, roads and ghats will together&#13;
stimulate increased trading and economic activity at the markets. It is reasonable to&#13;
argue that a proportion of these benefits is attributable to the market investment.&#13;
4.12   Seen as a joint investment with roads (with market investment being about 10%  of the&#13;
investment on a typical 7 km road improvement, the latter producing about 30% ERR), the investment&#13;
has high ERR even if market benefits are excluded. Testing of the sensitivity of the economic rate of&#13;
return to the key assumptions made in the SRR analysis shows that if the costs are 20% higher than&#13;
estimated the rate of return is 17%. If the spoilage savings is only 2.4% rather than the 3.0%&#13;
predicted, the rate of return is 16%. A spoilage savings of 2% is sufficient to give an economic return&#13;
rate of 12%.&#13;
4.13   The composite rate of return for the three components for which economic analysis has been&#13;
carried out ( weighted average) is 29.5%. Table 4.1 shows that the three components for which&#13;
economic analysis has been carried out represent 71 % of the total financial cost of the project. The&#13;
economic costs included in the analysis amount to 75.5% of the total economic cost of the project.&#13;
The components that have not been analyzed will also generate economic benefits. The construction of&#13;
'Structures on Other FRB' can be expected to have similar impacts to the SRRs. The road safety&#13;
measures will reduce losses due to accidental injury and death. Periodic maintenance of roads is&#13;
known to be economically efficient, and the ghat improvements will generate benefits through reduced&#13;
spoilage and increased safety. The pilot component to improve NMT will ultimately lead to more&#13;
efficient provision of rural transport services, and the technical assistance will increase the efficiency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
of LGED as a rural infrastructure provider. Further, as noted above, there are additional, unquantified&#13;
economic benefits from the three components that have been analyzed.&#13;
Other Development Impacts&#13;
4.14    The rate of return can be regarded as being based on partial benefits.  While transport cost&#13;
savings are the mechanism through which many of the economic impacts are generated, given that&#13;
transport and trading permeates so many aspects of rural life in Bangladesh the provision of improved&#13;
access will generate other effects such as new income-generation opportunities, faster diffusion of&#13;
agricultural technologies and increased utilization of health and educational services.&#13;

4.15    The main project beneficiaries will be the rural population within the influence of the project.&#13;
These investments are extensive and widely dispersed, and a substantial proportion of the population of&#13;
the project area will benefit. The project will have a direct impact on the income of farmers and farm&#13;
laborers, market traders, transport operators, construction and maintenance workers including&#13;
disadvantaged women, small and cottage industries, contractors, workshops and local manufacturing&#13;
industries, and local government bodies. More generally, the rural population will benefit through&#13;
increases in economic activity, employment and income-generation and through better access to work-&#13;
places, and to health, education, administrative and social services.  The improved transport and&#13;
trading system should lead to lower prices for basic commodities. Small and cottage rural industries&#13;
will benefit from improved access to raw materials and to markets. Rural health conditions will be&#13;
improved through the provision of clean, dry, hygienic facilities at rural markets and ghats.&#13;
4.16    The project will  also develop the capacity of local government bodies to assume greater&#13;
responsibility for local-level infrastructure and its financing, and will increase the participation of rural&#13;
communities in sustainable infrastructure development. The use and promotion of appropriate labor-&#13;
intensive technology in road improvement and maintenance will leave behind a valuable skill in the&#13;
rural areas for easily affordable maintenance systems strengthening future sustainability. The project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
will also strengthen LGED' s management and implementation capacity and capability as the&#13;
government agency with the main responsibility for rural infrastructure, and will increase the&#13;
capability and involvement of the private sector in rural infrastructure development.&#13;
4.17   Employment and poverty reduction:  The Project is part of IDA's program  of targeted&#13;
intervention due to its focus on low-income commnunities. The critical importance of improving the&#13;
condition of rural roads and markets in Bangladesh as a way to improve rural income and reduce&#13;
poverty has been recognized in the country's development strategy. The project focuses on rural areas&#13;
where the incidence of poverty is more widespread (see para. 2); its special focus is on Northwest&#13;
region, which is the poorest region in the country. Choice of project facilities has given priority to&#13;
areas where people suffer from inadequate access and poor market facilities. Overall, the proportion&#13;
of the poor among project beneficiaries will be significantly larger than their proportion in total&#13;
population (see para. 3). Improvement of markets will provide better and more healthy facilities for&#13;
poor market vendors. The use of labor-intensive methods for civil works will create over 20,000&#13;
person-years of employment in construction, and more than 2,000 person-years of employment&#13;
annually in maintenance which will continue beyond the project period; based on RRMIMP-1&#13;
completion studies, other new employment as transport operators (mainly NMT), vehicle repairs and&#13;
service, and small trading and shop-keeping could exceed 10,000 persons annually. Most of the&#13;
beneficiaries from increased employment will be the landless poor, destitute women, and under-&#13;
employed small farmers.  Most works would be done through labor-intensive methods, using&#13;
appropriate small equipment, to maximize employment impact. Many construction works, and all&#13;
routine maintenance works, will be targeted at the landless and at disadvantaged women, particularly&#13;
through the use of labor contracting societies under which poor workers organize themselves as small&#13;
contractors thus earning more than the usual wage.&#13;
B. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.18   There are no major risks in proceeding with the project. Project risks have been minimized by&#13;
special design features and measures taken or built into project preparation and implementation. The&#13;
project concept has already been tested successfully through the ongoing RRMIMP-1. The project has&#13;
been carefully designed to achieve effective implementation, and many of its features such as definition&#13;
of the PIO management structure, incremental staffing, tasks of the DSM consultants, and monitoring&#13;
procedures, are modeled on the ongoing project experience with necessary improvements based on&#13;
lessons learnt. LGED has demonstrated its capability to implement projects efficiently and coordinate&#13;
effectively with donors, and the project will further strengthen its management capacity. To sustain the&#13;
flow of benefits from project investments, Government funds are available for FRB maintenance, and&#13;
LGED has already established the basis of a maintenance management system, which will be further&#13;
supported through the project components.&#13;
4.19   The following assesses potential project risks, and measures adopted to minimize them: the&#13;
risks discussed relate to: (a) possible constraints in contractor capacity to implement the project which&#13;
is much larger than the ongoing project and is to be implemented in a shorter period; (b) possible&#13;
constraints in LGED's implementation capacity for the larger project; (c) delays in land acquisition, (d)&#13;
the large national component on rural structures which was not in the first project; (e) possible&#13;
failure of the participatory processes being tried out for the first time on such large scale; and (f)&#13;
inadequate maintenance funding and arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
(a) The project size and contractor capacity&#13;
4.20   Reference is invited to Annex 3.3 which  presents a full analysis of project size increase&#13;
compared to the ongoing first project, and assesses the capacity of contractors and LGED to implement&#13;
such a larger project. The proposed project is about 50% larger than the ongoing project comparing&#13;
levels of total physical output; considering also its shorter implementation period of five years, the&#13;
annual output level is about 107% more; if a six-year implementation period is considered, the annual&#13;
output is about 72% higher. Against this, the project area is about 75 % larger (14 districts versus 8),&#13;
which means that there is also about 75% increase in contractor capacity as the small size contractors&#13;
to do feeder road works and markets and river ghats are generally available in all districts, their&#13;
operations being generally limited by logistical problems to one or two districts; the project would&#13;
provide training and other support , including equipment on lease, to enhance the quality and capacity&#13;
of these contractors; in fact, recent bidding under retroactive financing for 45 km of roads (about 11&#13;
contracts) under the new project in the new project districts (greater Dhaka) has already shown an&#13;
average qualified bidders per contract.&#13;
4.21   Thus, about 75% capacity increase can be explained from the increased project area with its&#13;
own contracting capacity. The remaining extra capacity (of about 32%) is expected from the fact that&#13;
the new project is not a pilot project and is built on lessons already learnt from the first project in&#13;
trying out various specifications, standards and procedures.   LGED  have also become more&#13;
experienced; the new project has also many measures to increase contractor efficiency and capacity&#13;
(larger size contracts of average 4-6 km, with 2-year contracts, provision of mobilization advances for&#13;
buying own equipment, as against one-year contracts of 2-3 km without mobilization advance under the&#13;
first project; higher standards in prequalifying contractors, more training etc.); it also will give about&#13;
100 km of the roads to a new category of medium size contractors (for 10 km, US $ 1 m value&#13;
contracts) who currently work on the main roads projects under RHD, who will infuse new capacity to&#13;
the feeder road sector). In addition, 45 km FRB improvements have already started under retroactive&#13;
financing before project approval. Many initial delays which affected the first project would be avoided&#13;
by making the appointment of supervision consultants and bidding for first year works a condition&#13;
before Board presentation. The second project is much better prepared and its implementation in all&#13;
aspects would be more efficient. No significant risk in contractor capacity is therefore expected.&#13;
4.22   A sensitivity analysis shows that if a 6-year implementation period is used instead of 5 years,&#13;
the extra output and capacity needed is only 72% above the first project, which can be fully met from&#13;
the capacity gain due to area expansion; the factors of efficiency increase noted above will, in this&#13;
case, create a slack in capacity and give a large extra cushion. Therefore, if implementation is found&#13;
lagging, a decision can be made at mid-term review to extend the implementation period by one year or&#13;
to restructure the project with more allocation for fast moving components.&#13;
4.23   As regards the national components, the SRR components would be done mainly through a&#13;
different category of very small labor contractors (contracts of about $8000 each), for which there is&#13;
no shortage (see para. below on SRR). The NMT component would be implemented almost entirely&#13;
through experienced local NGOs with minimal supervision from LGED.&#13;
(b) LGED capacity to implement the project&#13;
4.24   LGED capacity to implement the project as noted has expanded very much under various&#13;
management improvement measures, and its institutional capacity would be further enhanced through&#13;
the project and through other donor support. LGED has become a much more experienced body over&#13;
the past decade (now implementing about US$1 billion worth of projects portfolio mostly funded by&#13;
foreign agencies) and is rated a successful and dynamic agency; (see para. 1.42). In addition, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
project would provide incremental staff in the project areas, will have a larger PIO with deputy&#13;
director for the new project districts as they need special attention and another Deputy Director to look&#13;
after the SRR components through participatory specialists to be recruited, and additional senior staff&#13;
for project monitoring and other functions (see para. 3.6), it will also have a large DSM consultants&#13;
support appropriate for the larger size project. A new feature would be technical audit by a private&#13;
sector firm, which will carry out regular six-monthly inspection of work verification and technical&#13;
quality as an additional  control and monitoring tool  to ensure  efficient and timely project&#13;
implementation. All these measures would minimize any possible risk about LGED's capacity to&#13;
manage the project.&#13;
(c) Delays in land acquisition&#13;
4.25   Procedure for acquisition of land in accordance with OD 4.30 will be more rigorous than on&#13;
the RRMIMP-1 in respect of compensating all affected persons at full market value of losses, and&#13;
paying compensation prior to commencement of construction works on the land to be acquired. The&#13;
risk is that land acquisition will take longer than planned so that implementation of FRB improvement&#13;
and upgrading works is delayed. This risk has been reduced by the following factors: Most works are&#13;
on existing alignments, and only marginal additional land needs to be acquired; LGED has experience&#13;
in land acquisition in the first project though compensation in that project was not insisted to be paid&#13;
before start of works (the typical land acquisition is for marginal addition to road width on existing&#13;
roads from land -owners alongside roads, who in many cases are willing to give land free for road&#13;
improvement since improved road will give them much better access to markets and health ,school and&#13;
other facilities, and will also enhance value of their remaining land); LGED has a decentralized field&#13;
office network which would help them to implement and monitor land acquisition work in&#13;
coordination with the various land-related agencies and local affected persons and UPs; LGED land&#13;
acquisition capacity will be reinforced with incremental staffing in each District and DSM consultant&#13;
inputs; and, a realistic action plan for land acquisition has been agreed.&#13;
(d) Large National SRR component&#13;
4.26   It is true that this is the first time a nationwide component with such participatory process is&#13;
being designed. However, risks of its failure are minimized by many factors. As noted (see para.&#13;
2.17) there is general enthusiasm among UPs, based on preliminary interviews, to go for this&#13;
component, as it meets a critical local need, with only 10-20% contribution of UP funds. The 6000&#13;
structures under the project could be absorbed by 1-2 structures in each UP, or more likely with more&#13;
in some UPs since a competitive system has been designed for eligibility. Though the initial selection&#13;
process may be delayed, their construction period is only about 2 months each. Contractor capacity&#13;
already exists as demonstrated by another ongoing nationwide structures project funded by USAID;&#13;
and the proposed project's efforts to involve labor-contracting societies will further enhance capacity.&#13;
LGED has already helped build about 1200 such rural structures with good success under the first&#13;
project (though selection was not participatory), and this has already established a good supervisory&#13;
and financial control system. The work will be supervised by LGED's Thana engineers who operate&#13;
in all Thanas; DSM engineers will also supervise the work on a selective basis. An experienced&#13;
Deputy Director will coordinate and provide overall supervision for the PIO. Even though UPs have a&#13;
major voice in selection and implementation, contracts will be awarded through TDCC Tender&#13;
Committees (which has LGED and UP representation) under IDA procurement procedures, as done&#13;
for the first project, and project accounts will be maintained as under the first project; therefore, there&#13;
is no risk of lack of financial control; private financial auditors and "technical performance" auditors&#13;
(new feature) would further keep close watch through sample checks of quality and financial aspects&#13;
with special emphasis on this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
(e) Insufficient community participation&#13;
4.27   Effective community participation is an important innovative feature. It is intended to achieve&#13;
selection of SRR schemes and design of market and ghat facilities to meet local priorities and user&#13;
preferences, and to develop community ownership of rural infrastructure. This being a new feature&#13;
and a slow process, there is a risk this may slow down the project components or may not be effective.&#13;
The factors reducing this risk are: GOB's and LGED's own present strategies emphasize community&#13;
participation, and LGED's commitment has already been shown through training schemes they have&#13;
started under project preparation phase and their action (already taken) to train and designate some of&#13;
their local staff as social organizers; the project further provides some expatriate support and additional&#13;
Laval experts to assist LGED to facilitate the process, and there will be close supervision and&#13;
monitoring of this component.&#13;
0) Inadequate maintenance&#13;
4.28   While lack of adequate maintenance is a usual risk, the present project should be considered&#13;
free from it. This risk has been minimized by: LGED's and Government's willingness to increase&#13;
maintenance budget allocations to adequate levels as observed during the current year (see para. 2.17),&#13;
LGED's ongoing special efforts to improve maintenance efficiency which will be assisted through the&#13;
project's maintenance component, and the project's provisions seeking Government assurances for&#13;
providing adequate maintenance funds in the project area and nationally.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
4.29   Most of the risks mentioned above, if they materialize, would express themselves as delays in&#13;
project completion and deferment of benefits and possibly increased costs. These situations are&#13;
analyzed through the Table 4.2 which shows that the project will yield an ERR above 17%, exceeding&#13;
even under very adverse situations (of costs up by 20%, along with benefits down by 20% or deferred&#13;
by one year); moreover, this ERR estimation excludes several project benefits.  The project is&#13;
therefore free from significant economic risks, even if some delays and slippages occur.&#13;

4.30   The project's monitoring system provides indicators and warning signals to enable action to be&#13;
taken if delays or other problems materialize. In the event of significant, unforeseen delays, the&#13;
comprehensive Mid-Term Review would provide an opportunity to revisit project design and to&#13;
restructure it with light of actual performance of various components to incorporate lesson learned.&#13;
The road sections and markets and ghats are largely discrete, separate, items, and excluding some of&#13;
them from the final project at that stage would not reduce benefits from the remaining components.&#13;
However, the overall assessment is that such risks are minimal.&#13;
5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1    During negotiations agreements were reached with GOB and LGED on the following:&#13;
(a)    GOB would review with IDA by September 30, 1997 road classification revisions&#13;
made by LGED, and would take into account IDA's views while finalizing the revised&#13;
classification (para. 1.12);&#13;
(b)    GOB would complete the study on UPs Financial Resource Mobilization by December&#13;
31, 1997 and, in consultation with IDA, prepare a plan of action based upon the study&#13;
results, and carry it out by December 31, 1998 (para. 1.35);&#13;
(c)    LGED would follow the criteria for selection and design of sub-components, and&#13;
implementation procedures and timeframe for various physical components under the&#13;
project, as agreed at negotiations (para. 2.12 and Annex 2.1);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
(d)    GOB will provide annual budget allocation for routine and periodic maintenance of all&#13;
maintainable FRBs, RRs and structures in the country from FY 1997/98 to 2001/02,&#13;
estimated at US$21 million in 1997/98, increasing annually by US$2.5 million&#13;
equivalent; and will provide additional budget allocation or other funding if funds from&#13;
external sources for the Road Maintenance Program (RMP) is discontinued or reduced&#13;
below the FY 1995/96 level (para. 2.17);&#13;
(e)    LGED will agree with IDA the annual maintenance program for the project area for&#13;
the following year before June 30 of each year, and designate a qualified maintenance&#13;
engineer in each district and thana in the country by March 31, 1997 (para. 2.18);&#13;
(f)    GOB would: (a) ensure that charges for renting equipment bought under the project are&#13;
sufficient to cover the maintenance and replacement costs of such equipment; (b) make&#13;
available to LGED annually, through budget allocations into a separate identifiable&#13;
item in LGED's budget, for maintenance and replacement costs of such equipment,&#13;
funds equivalent to the estimated rent collections for the following financial year; and&#13;
(c) ensure use of these accounts exclusively to fund maintenance and replacement of&#13;
equipment (para. 2.31);&#13;
(g)    GOB would implement the MANCAPS recommendations regarding LGED on: (i)&#13;
improved financial management and internal auditing; (ii) reduction of span of control&#13;
through more delegation of responsibilities, and creation of about 6 regional offices&#13;
headed by Superintending Engineers before March 31, 1997; and would fund from&#13;
revenue budget, from the fifth year of the project, seven positions of high level staff in&#13;
LGED, initially funded under the project (para. 2.33);&#13;
(h)    GOB would set up a committee with representatives from private and public sectors for&#13;
promoting private sector in the rural infrastructure sector, before March 31, 1997 (para&#13;
2.36);&#13;
(i)    GOB/LGED would furnish to IDA: (a) annual financial audit reports not later than&#13;
nine months after the end of each FY; and (b) six-monthly technical audit report not&#13;
later than three months after the end of each six-month period of works (para. 3.25);&#13;
and&#13;
(j)   Implement the Land Acquisition Action (para. 3.28) and Sectoral Environmental&#13;
Action Plans (para. 3.29).&#13;
5.2    As agreed during negotiations, GOB/LGED has already taken the following actions to facilitate&#13;
effective project implementation:&#13;
(a)   In order to increase resources available to UPs for infrastructure development and&#13;
maintenance, GOB has: (i) reduced its share of market lease revenue from 35% to 25%&#13;
and allowed the additional 10% to go directly to the UPs, where it is generated; (ii)&#13;
allocated half of the land-transfer tax revenue, currently going to District Development&#13;
Committees, to the UPs; (iii) increased lease value threshold for UP-managed markets&#13;
from Taka 50,000 to Taka 100,000; and (iv) introduced more transparent procedures&#13;
and wide based competition in market leasing in the project area (para. 1.35);&#13;
(b)    LGED has appointed the DSM  Consultants (para. 2.45); appointed 8 community&#13;
participation experts (para. 3.2); appointed all key PIO staff (para. 3.7); and they have&#13;
also completed contract award for most first year works (para. 2.45); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
(c)    GOB has also appointed a land acquisition monitoring committee at LGD to facilitate&#13;
land acquisition and compensation (para. 3.28).&#13;
5.3    Agreement was reached during negotiations that the condition of credit effectiveness would be&#13;
as follows:&#13;
(a)    That all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the GOB-SDC cofinancing&#13;
agreement should have been fulfilled, other than those related to the effectiveness of&#13;
the IDA-GOB Credit Agreement (para. 2.41).&#13;
5.4    With the above conditions and agreements, the project would be suitable for an IDA Credit to&#13;
the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh of US$133.00 million equivalent on standard IDA terms with a&#13;
maturity of 40 years.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
SECOND RURAL ROAD AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM,&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT OF MARKETS AND GHATS&#13;
1.    Introduction&#13;
Local Government is an important partner in the RRMIMP-2 for several reasons:&#13;
1.    Investment in rural infrastructure development continues to be a priority in Bangladesh.&#13;
Several Rural Development Projects (RDPs) such as the RRMIMP-2 provide this rural infrastructure.&#13;
This will increase the future requirements for maintenance for which responsibility lies to a great&#13;
extend with Local Government.&#13;
2.    In crder to make sure that the real needs of the rural population are addressed it is important to&#13;
associate Local Government and the local population from the planning stage on.  Responsible&#13;
management and maintenance of the rural infrastructure will improve when Local Government and the&#13;
population are involved early on in the process of provision of the infrastructure. Their participation&#13;
in planning and monitoring is therefore a necessary aspect of the project. Institutional strengthening&#13;
will improve the capacity of local governments to take up these tasks.&#13;
3.    The financing of infrastructure maintenance and investments is another aspect of the Local&#13;
Governments' responsibilities. The mobilisation of local resources, both to contribute to the cost of&#13;
infrastructure investment, and to finance the maintenance of certain types of rural infrastructure, is also&#13;
important in ensuring that infrastructure investment schemes meet local priorities, in developing a&#13;
sense of local ownership of the improved infrastructure, and in achieving sustainability of the&#13;
infrastructure investment. Finding ways to increase local resources will be necessary if the local&#13;
governments are to take up their responsibilities.&#13;
2.    Evolution of Local Government in Bangladesh&#13;
Local Government exists in the sub-continent since ancient times. In the Rig Vedas, the oldest Hindu&#13;
religious writings, dating from approximately 1200 B.C., forms of village self-government are&#13;
mentioned. Panchayets (village councils) seem to have existed since very early times even if their&#13;
functions, power and their place in the system of self-government vary considerably.&#13;
Under the early British rule a policy of curbing the powers of indigenous local institutions was&#13;
adopted, but by the end of the 19th century the need for responsible local government was recognised&#13;
and introduced by passing the "Local Self-Government Act of 1885". The "Bengal Village Self-&#13;
Government Act of 1919" introduced more representative local government bodies. The Union Boards&#13;
comprised two-thirds of elected members and one-third nominated, they covered 10 to 12 square miles&#13;
and a population of about 6,000 to 8,000 people. At the higher up level Local Board members were&#13;
chosen by open election and finally at the upper local government level, District Boards were for two-&#13;
thirds elected and one-third nominated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 2 of 18&#13;
After the partition of India in 1947, the Government of Pakistan retained the system of Union and&#13;
District Boards - the intermediate local boards had slowly died out - , this situation persisted until&#13;
1959.                                                                                  The&#13;
military junta which staged a coup d'etat in 1958 introduced an authoritarian government and&#13;
promulgated the "Basic Democracies Order". In contrast with earlier local government enactments,&#13;
this order was a central legislation having jurisdiction over the whole of Pakistan.  The local&#13;
government system consisted of four tiers in rural areas: Union Councils, Thana Councils,&#13;
District Councils and Divisional Councils. One-third of the Union Councils were nominated but in the&#13;
three higher up Councils the official nominees could represent up to 50 percent of the membership.&#13;
In 1972 soon after the emergence of Bangladesh all local bodies except the Divisional Council were&#13;
dissolved and administrators appointed to take over their functions. The Divisional Council was later&#13;
abolished. In 1976 the new government promulgated a Local Government Ordinance with three tiers:&#13;
Union Parishad, Thana Parishad and Zila Parishad. After Ershad took power in 1982, local&#13;
govermnent was reorganised with the Thana as focal point of administration. Responsibility for all&#13;
developmental activities at the local level was transferred to the Thana Parishads, renamed Upazila&#13;
Parishads. The central government retained direct responsibility for all major development activities.&#13;
After the political upheavals of 1990, the new democratic government which came to power in 1991&#13;
abolished the Upazila Parishads. Further legislation created a two tier local government with Union&#13;
Parishads and District Parishads. At the thana level a Thana Development Co-ordination Committee&#13;
was created and at the village level a Village Development Committee.&#13;
3.    The Actual Situation of the Union Parishads (UPs)&#13;
The Union Parishad is an elected representative body. Its functions have been defined in the Local&#13;
Government (Union Parishad) (Amendment) Act, 1993, which lists about 38 functions, the most&#13;
important of these concern:&#13;
* maintenance of security;&#13;
* adoption and implementation of development schemes;&#13;
* promotion of family planning;&#13;
* development and use of local resources;&#13;
* protection and maintenance of public property such as roads, bridges, canals, embankments,&#13;
ghats, markets, telephone and electricity lines;&#13;
* registration of births, deaths, blind people, beggars and destitutes;&#13;
* conducting of census of all kinds;&#13;
* etc.&#13;
In addition the Union Parishad is also charged with the planning function, the UP is required to&#13;
prepare Five-Year and Annual development Plans. Unfortunately most UPs do not have the required&#13;
staff to carry out this activity.&#13;
The structure and staffing of Union Parishads are detailed in Attachment 1.&#13;
In the area of infrastructure the relevant responsibilities of Union Parishads can be summarised as&#13;
follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 3 of 18&#13;
* Implementation of earthworks and tree-plantation works (excluding FRB works) and of&#13;
other infrastructure improvement schemes with a value of less than Taka 50,000.&#13;
* Maintenance of Rural Roads - though LGED may maintain some important RR1 roads and&#13;
is also responsible for maintenance of Structures on Rural Roads.&#13;
* Maintenance, through the relevant management committee, of markets and ghats within the&#13;
Union.&#13;
The key weaknesses in the new system are of institutional and of financial nature&#13;
(a) institutional:&#13;
* Unions are at very low level - 4,450 Unions, average area 30sq.km., average population&#13;
25,000.&#13;
* Union Parishads have very limited staff capacity or capability, and much of the work must&#13;
be done by the elected members - yet at the same time progressively increasing demands are&#13;
placed on the Union Parishads.&#13;
(b) financial:&#13;
* The new procedures, responsibilities and revenue powers are not well understood, and&#13;
funds do not necessarily flow, nor are they necessarily used, as defined.&#13;
* There is a political reluctance for the elected members to collect revenue from 'their&#13;
electorate".&#13;
4.1    The Union Parishads' Financial Situation&#13;
4.1.1  Union Parishad Revenue Sources&#13;
Union Parishads have several sources of revenue:&#13;
4.1.2  Annual Revenue Budget from Central Government&#13;
This contributes towards the costs of honoraria for the UP chairman (33%) and&#13;
members (50%), and the salaries of the Secretary, Dafadar and Chowkidars -&#13;
in each case the GOB contribution is 50% (see Attachment 1).&#13;
4.1.3 Revenue Raised Locally&#13;
Following the re-organisation of local government, Union Parishads have the&#13;
power, since 1993, to raise revenue from the following sources:&#13;
* Annual tax on value of homesteads, or Union 'rate'.&#13;
* Taxes on professions, trades and callings.&#13;
* Taxes on cinemas, dramatic and theatrical shows, and other entertainments and&#13;
amusements of like nature.&#13;
* Fees for licences and permits granted by the UP.&#13;
* Lease money from specific, bazaars, ghats and ferries within the Union&#13;
boundaries as determined by the GOB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 4 of 18&#13;
* Lease money from specific water bodies within the Union boundaries, as&#13;
determined by the GOB.&#13;
4.1.4  Income From Leasing of Markets. (See Attachment 2)&#13;
Union Parishads should receive 15% of the lease value of all markets in the&#13;
Union for market development and maintenance; and 40% of the lease value of&#13;
markets in the Union with a lease of up to Taka 50,000 in the Bengali Year&#13;
1400, for Union development.&#13;
4.1.5  Financing at Thana Level for Infrastructure Development&#13;
Following the abolition of the Upazila (Thana) Parishads in 1991, and the&#13;
abolition of revenue-raising authority at this level, Thana Development Co-&#13;
ordination Committees (TDCC) were formed - See Attachment 3. Certain funds&#13;
flow to Thana level, and decisions over the allocation of those funds is made&#13;
by the TDCC. The key feature of the TDCC is that its voting membership&#13;
comprises the Chairmen of the Unions in the Thana. However Thana-level&#13;
representatives of Central Government also sit on the TDCC, and the Member&#13;
of Parliament acts as an adviser - in practice these persons inevitably have&#13;
some influence over decisions.&#13;
There are two sources of funds at Thana level:&#13;
Income from Leasing of Markets. As per Attachment 2, the Thana receives&#13;
10% of the lease revenue from all markets for "market development and&#13;
emergency and disaster work" and 40% of the&#13;
lease value of all markets with a lease of more than Taka 50,000 in the Bengali&#13;
Year 1400 for Thana development.&#13;
The Development Assistance Fund for Union and Thana Development -&#13;
financed by GOB from the Annual Development Program and known as the&#13;
'Block Grant for Union and Thana Development'. See Attachment 4. In&#13;
1995/96 the total block grant is Taka 2,000 million, allocated between Thanas&#13;
using a formula that takes account of population, land area and 'backwardness'.&#13;
The average grant per Thana is Taka 4.4 million, of which up to 60% can be&#13;
used for transport and communications works including construction and&#13;
maintenance of Rural Roads, small bridges and culverts.&#13;
4.2    Union Parishad Revenues: A Survey&#13;
At present revenue generation by the Union Parishads is weak. A survey of 15 Unions (by the&#13;
Project preparation consultants) indicated that:&#13;
*     The average local revenue collected (excluding market leasing) was about Taka 55,000&#13;
per Union per annum (range from Taka 21,000 to 135,000). This equates to about&#13;
Taka 2 per person, or Taka 5 per adult.&#13;
*     The revenue actually collected was only 46% of that budgeted (range 24% to 76%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 5 of 18&#13;
Union Parishads do not exploit effectively their powers to collect revenue from&#13;
business activities and leasing of water bodies, though they do collect such items as&#13;
village court and pound fees.&#13;
*     About 15% of the revenue collected is used to cover collection fees.&#13;
*     Various collection methods are used including salaried tax collector, collection agent&#13;
on commission basis, village police on commission basis, and collection by UP&#13;
members.&#13;
Other sources indicate that revenue collection by Union Parishads is typically less than&#13;
Taka 100,000 per annum.&#13;
The present annual income of a 'typical' Union Parishad is estimated below (though it&#13;
should be emphasised that there are considerable variations around this 'typical' situation) is:&#13;
Taka&#13;
Revenue from GOB                         50,000&#13;
Locally Collected Revenue                75,000&#13;
15% of Market Lease for Maintenance      30,000&#13;
40% of Lease Value of Small Markets      10Q000&#13;
Total                                   165,000&#13;
The Revenue from GOB must be used for the operating costs of the UP, and&#13;
the locally collected revenue will be consumed by this item (the estimated&#13;
staffing cost of a Union Parishad is about Taka 100,000), and by collection&#13;
costs. Thus, a typically UP may have Taka 40-50,000 to devote to&#13;
development activities. If the Union is in the RMP program (see below), Taka&#13;
10,000 to 15,000 will be allocated to this.&#13;
The picture in respect of funds available at Thana level is healthier. Income per&#13;
average Thana is estimated at:&#13;
Taka&#13;
40% of Leas of Larger Markets           700,000&#13;
10% of Market Lease of All Markets      200,000&#13;
Block Grant                           4,350,000&#13;
Total                                 5,250,000&#13;
If these funds are equally divided among the Unions (which is not necessarily&#13;
the case), then each Union has an allocation of about Taka 530,000 per annum.&#13;
4.3    Actual Union Parishad Involvement in Infrastructure Projects&#13;
Union Parishads are involved in certain infrastructure development projects because funds flow&#13;
to the Unions and/or because the Unions have to make financial contributions:&#13;
* The CARE Road Maintenance Project (RMP) which was implemented through the Ministry&#13;
of Relief, will transfer to LGED in 1995/96. The project monetises Canadian food-aid and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 6 of 18&#13;
channels funds to Union Parishads for routine road maintenance by crews of destitute&#13;
women. Under the revised system in LGED:&#13;
0 The project will operate in the majority of Unions (about 3,600) maintaining about&#13;
20km of road per Union. A new development is that some of the maintenance work&#13;
will be on earthen FRBs and the remainder on RRs, whereas previously it was all on&#13;
RRs.&#13;
0 Union Parishads will contribute 10% of the cost (Taka 10,000 to 15,000 per Union).&#13;
0 The GOB contribution will increase from 10% in 1995/96 to 15% in 1996/97 to 25%&#13;
in 1997/98.&#13;
* The LGED/CARE IFFD project finances structures and earthworks on rural roads.&#13;
Structures works are implemented by the Thana, with a 10% cost contribution from the&#13;
Union Parishad (this contribution can come eventually from the block grant). Earthworks,&#13;
with payment in food, are implemented through the Union Parishad.&#13;
* The WFP-supported GCCR programme is essentially implemented at Thana-level. However&#13;
the Union Parishad has to make a 5 % contribution to any small structures built on the roads&#13;
using monetised food-aid.&#13;
The new EC food-aided IFADEP includes provision for use of food-aid for maintenance of&#13;
improved embankments.&#13;
* There are also GOB food-for-work schemes, and a new GOB scheme for structures on&#13;
Rural Roads.&#13;
5.    Co-funding by UPs of Infrastructure Investments under RRMIMP-2&#13;
5.1   Structures on Rural Roads (SRR) Scheme&#13;
The UPs will participate in the investments at the rate of 10% of the construction cost&#13;
from July 1996 to June 1999 and 20% from this date on. Agreement has been reached&#13;
with LGED and CARE that LGED would co-ordinate between projects so that the&#13;
same figures are used on all projects. Discussion with beneficiaries showed an&#13;
enthusiastic response.&#13;
5.2    Market Improvement&#13;
The average market improvement will cost Taka 2.6 million, the most expensive about&#13;
Taka 4.5 million. A 10% local contribution is proposed, average Taka 260,000,&#13;
maximum Taka 450,000. The project will construct 136 markets in 97 Thanas, i.e. an&#13;
average of 1.5 markets per thana over a five year period. If the local contribution was&#13;
paid from the 40% of lease value of larger markets that is allocated to the TDCCs, this&#13;
would consume 12% of that allocation.&#13;

5.3    Ghat Improvement&#13;
The average ghat improvement will cost Taka 1.7 million. A 10% local contribution is&#13;
proposed, average Taka 170,000. The project will construct 41 rural river jetties or&#13;
ghats over a five-year period.&#13;
6.    Recommendations for the Institutional Strengthening of UPs&#13;
Several actions are under way to improve the functioning of the UPs, in particular training by the&#13;
National Institute for Local Government (NILG) and the development of the Union Planbook and&#13;
training in its use by LGED.&#13;
The main problem encountered remains that not enough funds are available to hire qualified personnel&#13;
to assume the different tasks assigned to the UPs with the result that the elected members must execute&#13;
these tasks. The elected members are often not familiarised enough with these tasks and further&#13;
training will be necessary. The project in collaboration with the LGED training cell and NILG will&#13;
contribute to this training. As soon as more funds become available (see chapter 7) additional staff&#13;
may be hired and will have to be trained&#13;
As explained elsewhere community participation is an important issue in the project and the project&#13;
will assist UPs in this area with the help of the LGED community organisers.&#13;
7.    Recommendations for Increasing UPs' Financial Resources&#13;
The main bottleneck for an efficient functioning of the UPs is the scarcity of funds available.&#13;
The project will examine this issue and make recommendations in order to increase their resources.&#13;
Several areas of possible intervention have been identified.&#13;
1. Market Leasing&#13;
2. More Efficient Collection from Existing Revenue Sources&#13;
3. Transfer of Central Government resources to UPs&#13;
4. New Revenue Raising Measures&#13;
5. Contributions from Local 'Interest Groups&#13;
7.1    Market Leasing&#13;
Based on the analysis of market leasing in the project area, lease revenue is distributed&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Central Government: 35%&#13;
Thana-Level:        45%&#13;
Unions:             20%&#13;
The Union Parishads get only limited direct benefit from the markets within their&#13;
Unions.&#13;
Lease values are very substantially below the income potential of the markets. Surveys&#13;
indicate returns on investment to the leaseholder typically in excess of 200% per&#13;
annum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 8 of 18&#13;
The following measures are to be considered in relation to market lease revenues:&#13;
Allowing Union Parishads to lease larger markets, and to retain a greater proportion of&#13;
the revenue, would provide an incentive for them to push up lease values. The project&#13;
recommends as an up-front action the raising of the lease value threshold from Tk.&#13;
50,000 to Tk. 100,000. An in depth study to be executed under the project will&#13;
consider further raising of this threshold.&#13;
*     Another way to increase UP revenue from market leases would be to reduce the central&#13;
governments share and increase the UPs share. The project recommends as an up front&#13;
action to reduce the central governments share from 35% to 25% and allow the&#13;
additional 10% to go directly to the UPs;&#13;
*     Adopting measures to make the leasing process more truly competitive and reducing&#13;
collusion would generate substantial additional revenue. Based on the analysis of&#13;
market leasing in the project area, if leases were increased by 50% in the project area,&#13;
this would generate Taka 100 million per annum - which would cover routine&#13;
maintenance cost of 10,000km of Rural Road. Measures include:&#13;
- wider advertising of lease bidding (national level)&#13;
- monitoring of income from market to set "reserve value" for leases&#13;
- encourage NGOs to become involved in bidding for market leases&#13;
- tendering done by district level agencies&#13;
- appropriated user participation under agreed guidelines&#13;
7.2    More Efficient Collection from Existing Revenue Sources&#13;
Two direct approaches can be examined:&#13;
i)    Focus on collecting more revenue from beneficiaries of infrastructure investments:&#13;
c collect licence fees from bicycles, rickshaws, rickshaw vans&#13;
- generate revenue from motor vehicles that use the improved roads, e.g. bus stands,&#13;
parking fees at markets, mooring fees at ghats&#13;
* licensing of businesses that grow up around improved markets and along roads&#13;
ii)    General Increase in the Efficiency of Revenue Collection:&#13;
* Indexation&#13;
* Setting of Targets&#13;
* Contracting-Out Revenue Collection&#13;
* Incentives for Efficient Revenue Collection&#13;
* Collection Camps&#13;
Making matching grants available as in the SRR, Market and Ghat components may make tax&#13;
collection also more interesting to the UP authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 9 of 18&#13;
7.3    Transfer of Central Government resources to Ups&#13;
Another way to increase resources of UPs would be to transfer tax revenues directly to&#13;
UPs. An in depth study to be executed under the project will make recommendations in&#13;
this area.&#13;
As an up front action the project recommends that Government should allocate at least&#13;
half of the land-transfer-tax revenue going now to the Zila Parishad (district), to the&#13;
UP's generating this revenue, compared to none at present (average allocation from&#13;
this source is currently about 10 million Taka per district). Since land value increases&#13;
with improved rural infrastructure, this is a good way of levying user charges.&#13;
7.4    New Revenue-Raising Measures&#13;
Some suggestions have been made in this area.&#13;
*Convert disused land to ponds, and lease out&#13;
eLegitimise 'non-legal' use of land around markets&#13;
*Tree planting scheme on Rural Roads can provide income for UPs (fast-growing ipil-&#13;
ipil)&#13;
*UPs to collect marriage registration fee&#13;
An in depth study will be executed under the project and will make recommendations&#13;
in this area.&#13;
7.5    Contributions from Local 'Interest Groups':&#13;
Community participation work by the project preparation consultants indicates:&#13;
*  a willingness by market users to pay more for improved markets if the&#13;
improvements reflect their needs (participation in design)&#13;
*  willingness by communities to have system for paying for use of structures, e.g.&#13;
tolls.&#13;
People may even put up money in advance to contribute to investment schemes.&#13;
7.6   In Depth Study on UPs Financial Resources&#13;
As mentioned above an in depth study will be executed under the project and will make&#13;
recommendations on ways to raise UP resources. The terms of reference of this study&#13;
is given in Annex 2.12: "Outline Terms of Reference for Studies". (see also&#13;
Attachment 4).&#13;

STRUCTURE AND STAFFING OF UNION PARISHAD&#13;
Each Union consists of three wards. From each ward three members are directly elected to the Union&#13;
Parishad (Council) on the basis of adult franchise from the concerned ward. The Chairman of the&#13;
Union Parishad (UP) is directly elected on the basis of adult franchise from the whole of the Union. In&#13;
addition there are three reserved seats on the Union Parishad exclusively for women members, who are&#13;
elected by the nine ward members. Thus a UP comprises 12 members and a Chairnan.&#13;
Each UP has a full-time Secretary, appointed by the Deputy Commissioner (DC) of the concerned&#13;
District. In addition, each UP employs a Dafadar (a 'local' policeman) and Chowkidars (village&#13;
watchmen) who are appointed by the Thana Nirbahi Officer (TNO). Thus none of the UP staff are&#13;
directly recruited and employed by the UP.&#13;
The UP Chairman receives an honorarium (Taka 500 per month), one-third paid by the GOB and two-&#13;
thirds from revenue raised locally by the UP. The ward members receive an honorarium of Taka 200&#13;
per month, 50% paid by the GOB and 50% from revenue raised locally by the UP. The salary of the&#13;
Secretary is determined by the DC, and is in the range Taka 2,500 - 4,000 per month. 50% of the&#13;
salary of the Secretary, and of the Dafadar and Chowkidars, is paid by the GOB and 50% from&#13;
revenue raised locally by the UP. Thus the UPs have to contribute, from the revenues that they raise,&#13;
to the salaries of their staff and to the honoraria of the Chairmen and members. In practice these&#13;
expenditures are the first call on locally-raised revenue.&#13;

THE THANA DEVELOPMENT CO-ORDINATION COMMITTEE DETAILS&#13;
Each Thana has a Development Co-ordination Committee (TDCC), whose functions are to:&#13;
* Review and co-ordinate project feasibility, area-wise priorities for development projects,&#13;
and other matters.&#13;
* Prepare development projects.&#13;
* Advise UPs in preparing and implementing rural development programs.&#13;
* Co-ordinate between locally prepared projects and national development programs.&#13;
* Advise on acceptance and implementation of development projects upon the request of the&#13;
UPs.&#13;
* Resolve inter-Union and inter-sectoral conflicts.&#13;
* Review the progress of development projects under implementation in the Thana.&#13;
The membership of the TDCC comprises:&#13;
* One person from amongst the UP Chairmen who acts as Chairman of the TDCC on a&#13;
rotating basis (the chairmanship changes for every meeting).&#13;
* The Chairmen of all Union Parishads of the Thana who are voting members of the TDCC.&#13;
* Three persons from the female members of the UPs in the Thana (nominated by the&#13;
government) who are voting members of the TDCC.&#13;
* Heads of different government offices in the Thana who are non-voting members of the&#13;
TDCC:&#13;
-     Thana Nirbahi Officer&#13;
-     Thana Engineer&#13;
-     Thana Health and Famnily Planning Officer&#13;
-     Thana Education Officer&#13;
-     Thana Agriculture Officer&#13;
-     Thana Co-operative Officer&#13;
-     Thana Livestock Officer&#13;
-     Thana Fisheries Officer&#13;
-     Thana Social Welfare Officer&#13;
-     Police Officer in charge of Thana&#13;
-     Thana Ansar and VDP Officer&#13;
-     Thana Food Controller&#13;
-     Thana Statistical Officer&#13;
-     Thana Rural Development Officer&#13;
The TNO acts as Secretary of the Committee. Members of Parliament whose constituency includes part&#13;
of the Thana act as advisers to the Committee.&#13;
The TDCC is important in respect of rural infrastructure development because it is responsible for the&#13;
allocation to projects of the Block Grant for Union and Thana Development, and for the allocation of&#13;
funds that flow to the Thana from market leasing.&#13;

THE BLOCK GRANT FOR UNION AND THANA DEVELOPMENT&#13;
The nation-wide budget allocation for the Block Grant for Union and Thana Development was Taka&#13;
1,000 million in 1993/94, increased to Taka 1,500 million in 1994/95 and Taka 2,000 million in&#13;
1995/96. The allocation between Thanas is based on a formula with the following weights - population&#13;
50%, land area 25%, and backwardness 25%. On average, the budget equates to an allocation of Taka&#13;
2.2 million per Thana (equivalent to Taka 0.23 million per Union) in 1993/94, Taka 3.3 million per&#13;
Thana (equivalent to Taka 0.34 million per Union) in 1994/95, and Taka 4.4 million per Thana&#13;
(equivalent to Taka 0.45 million per Union) in 1995/96.&#13;
The guidelines for allocation of the Block Grant (Government Circular of 25th October 1993) are:&#13;
Sector                       Minimum          Maximum&#13;
a.    Agriculture and Irrigation                 15%               30%&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70&#13;
Annex 1. I&#13;
Page 13 of 18&#13;
The guidelines state that priority should be given to:&#13;
Completion of unfinished Rural Roads and maintenance of finished schemes.&#13;
*  Construction of bridges/culverts on Rural Roads, particularly where one or two structures&#13;
will give complete access along a road.&#13;
*  Projects which facilitate inter-village and inter-Union communication and bring benefits to&#13;
the people.&#13;
*  Road-side tree plantation.&#13;
Implementation of projects financed by the Block Grant (and from the Thana receipts from market&#13;
leasing) is through a Project Supervision Committee comprising the relevant Union Chairman, a&#13;
member of the concerned Department at Thana Level, an SAE nominated by the Thana Engineer, and&#13;
a concerned ward member of the UP. Infrastructure contracts for earthworks, for tree plantation and&#13;
for other works up to Taka 50,000 can be administered by the UP. Other infrastructure contracts are&#13;
tendered through a Thana Tender Committee and let by the LGED Thana Engineer. The relevant&#13;
Union Chairman, the TNO and the Thana Engineer sit on the Tender Committee. The UP is&#13;
responsible for visiting the schemes regularly and reviewing progress. Infrastructure works are&#13;
supervised by the Thana Engineer. Funds for works tendered by the Tender Committee do not flow&#13;
through the concerned UP accounts, they are managed at Thana level with approval for payment by the&#13;
TNO and the Thana Engineer.&#13;

MANAGEMENT OF MARKETS AND GHATS&#13;
1.    The Existing Situation&#13;
1.1    Market Leasing and Management&#13;
1.1.1. Leasing of Markets&#13;
A UP may lease one or more markets within the Union boundaries whose lease value does not exceed&#13;
Taka 50,000, based on the value in the Bengali year 1400. All other markets are leased by the Thana.&#13;
Leases are let annually, and this should be by sealed competitive bidding.&#13;
The distribution of revenue from market leasing is shown on the next table. 35% of the revenue is&#13;
transferred to central government, and 10% to the Thana. 15% is allocated to maintenance of the&#13;
concerned market. Until recently this was reduced to 5% if the market had been improved under an&#13;
RDP. However this has now been changed so that the allocation can be increased to 25% for an&#13;
improved market - this reflects recognition of the need to maintain the investment in the improved&#13;
markets. The balance of 40% is allocated as follows:&#13;
For small markets with a lease value up to Taka 50,000, to Union development activities.&#13;
For larger markets with a lease value of more than Taka 50,000, to Thana development&#13;
activities.&#13;

Thus, only limited revenue from market leasing flows to the concerned UP, in particular because of the&#13;
division at a lease value of Taka 50,000. Unions obtain little direct benefit from important markets&#13;
within their boundaries.&#13;
1.1.2  Management of Markets&#13;
Each leased market is managed by a Union Market Management Committee (UMMC) which is&#13;
responsible for operation and maintenance. The membership of the UMMC comprises:&#13;
*     Union Parishad Chairman (chairman of the UMMC)&#13;
*     Three Union Parishad members, one from each ward, plus one female member, all to&#13;
be nominated by the UP.&#13;
*     One Government Officer in the Thana to be nominated by the TNO.&#13;
*     One Teacher from a High School in the Union to be nominated by the TNO.&#13;
*     The Union Tahsildar.&#13;
*     Two Representatives from shopkeepers and traders in the concerned market.&#13;
*     The Union Secretary who also acts as Secretary of the UMMC.&#13;
However it is reported that many of these UMMCs are not fully effective.&#13;
1.2    Ghat Leasing&#13;
The situation concerning the leasing of ghats is less clear, ghats can be leased out by:&#13;
. the RHD, this is the case when the ghats have been build by RHD and are being used by&#13;
ferry launches;&#13;
* the district (Zila Parishad), this is case for the majority of the ghats;&#13;
* the Union Parishad, in some isolated cases;&#13;
* and even in some cases by individuals who have invested in the construction of private&#13;
Ghats.&#13;
.&#13;
Sometimes when a ghat forms an integrated part of a market it can be leased out as part of the market&#13;
lease. The proposed project would require Government to set up ghat leasing procedures and ghat&#13;
management committees on the lines of UMMC's for the ghats to be completed in the first two years in&#13;
consultation with IDA. This process and procedures will be reviewed and refined further in the light of&#13;
the UP financial study is finalised.&#13;
2.    Weaknesses and Shortcomings of the System&#13;
Only limited revenue from market leasing flows to the UPs, in particular because of the lease value&#13;
threshold of Taka 50,000. Unions obtain little direct benefit from important markets within their&#13;
boundaries.&#13;
There is also considerable evidence to show that the present lease auctioning system is not fully&#13;
competitive and that cost recovery is very poor. A survey of 20 markets carried out as part of the&#13;
RRMIMP Upazila Financing Study in 1992 showed that on average the net income to the leaseholder&#13;
from leasing a market - ie. the toll revenue less the lease and the operating costs - was over 300% of&#13;
the amount paid to lease the market. In 65 % of the cases the return was more than 200%. Further, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 16 of 18&#13;
return tended to be higher for the markets with lower lease values. This suggests that low lease values&#13;
to a considerable degree reflect uncompetitive lease bidding, rather than low income potential of the&#13;
markets. A feasibility study for an ADB-financed RDP found similar results. Based on data from eight&#13;
markets studied in detail under the RRMIMP SEM&amp;E, the net income to the leaseholder is more than&#13;
250% of the lease value.&#13;
Many UMMCs do not function effectively. The defined membership puts the committee too close to&#13;
the UP; the functions and responsibilities of the committee cf. the market leaseholder are not well&#13;
understood; the leaseholder is considered to exercise the real power; the system for allocation of funds&#13;
to market maintenance is not fully understood and these funds do not appear to flow. one of the&#13;
consequences is that often the leaseholder of the market does not do the cleaning and routine&#13;
maintenance of the market. The UMMCs seem often to be powerless to enforce the conditions of the&#13;
contract.&#13;
3.    Economic Benefits and Cost Recovery from Market Improvements&#13;
3.1    Cost of Market Improvements&#13;
For project costing purposes, markets have been divided into three categories with different&#13;
improvement costs. Markets will be improved in two phases over two years. The costs of&#13;
improvement, and of routine and periodic maintenance, are:&#13;
Category A (small):  Improvement Cost:   Year 1, Taka 1.14 million&#13;
Year 2, Taka 0.76 million&#13;
Routine Maintenance: Taka 0.006 million per annum&#13;
Periodic Maintenance: Taka 0.036 million per 5 years&#13;
Category B (medium): Improvement Cost:   Year 1, Taka 1.56 million&#13;
Year 2, Taka 1.09 million&#13;
Routine Maintenance: Taka 0.009 million per annum&#13;
Periodic Maintenance: Taka 0.053 million per 5 years&#13;
Category C (large):  Improvement Cost:   Year 1, Taka 2.16 million&#13;
Year 2, Taka 1.44 million&#13;
Routine Maintenance: Taka 0.014 million per annum&#13;
Periodic Maintenance: Taka 0.074 million per 5 years&#13;
Assuming a 15 year life of the market after improvements are completed, with no residual value, and&#13;
an interest rate of 12%, the discounted investment and maintenance costs of the improved markets are:&#13;
Category A (small):   Taka 1.884 million&#13;
Category B (medium): Taka 2.630 million&#13;
Category C (large):   Taka 3.588 million&#13;
Market improvement costs (including daily cleaning) are borne by the leaseholder. Studies show that&#13;
average lease revenue of vendors is high enough to cover al remaining operation and maintenance&#13;
costs, and yield a positive financial return on the investment (though often less than 12%), making the&#13;
investment sustainable. The large hygienic, health and other social benefits and economic benefits to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 17 of 18&#13;
the poor vendors and farmers further reinforce this investment. Various measures to increase lease&#13;
revenue would be considered under this project.&#13;
4.    Recommendations for Improving Management and Cost Recovery.&#13;
(see also para. 1.35 in SAR)&#13;
As in other countries, markets are potentially an important source of income for the development&#13;
budget of local government. But as indicated above, UPs get only part of the income (40%) from the&#13;
smaller markets and only a fixed lump sum (Tk. 20.000) from the markets with a lease above Tk.&#13;
50,000, the main income from the markets goes thus to central and thana level government. This&#13;
regulation does not create enough of an incentive to motivate UPs to develop their markets into&#13;
dynamic income generating operations. This is probably one of the main reasons for the ineffectiveness&#13;
of the Union Market Management Committees. Another reason for their ineffectiveness is probably the&#13;
fact that members of this committee are not rewarded for the work they do in this commission.&#13;
A number of measures could be taken to increase the part of the income going to the UPs in order to&#13;
motivate them into developing the markets, such as: increasing the limit of Tk. 50,000 to Tk. 100,000&#13;
or Tk. 200,000 and decreasing the part of central government. But it could also be argued that well&#13;
functioning markets are of prime importance for the country and that therefore important incentives&#13;
must be given to UPs to efficiently manage and develop their markets. This could be done by letting&#13;
them keep all the income generated by the markets and even by providing them with matching grants to&#13;
increase proportionally the income generated by the markets. These measures would provide powerful&#13;
incentives to UPs to develop these markets and would at the same time provide the UPs with an&#13;
important source of revenues. The argument that the income of markets must be distributed to all&#13;
unions, also to those that do not have important markets, should be put in the context of the global&#13;
resources of the UPs - most of the income of UPs comes from central government anyway and it is&#13;
very well possible to compensate UPs that do not have an important market, without taking income&#13;
away from UPs that do have an efficient income generating market.&#13;
Other measures to improve revenue from markets would be to increase the tolls paid by the market&#13;
vendors. Tolls (unit rates per bag, basket or quantity of produce sold) are now the same for all markets&#13;
in each district and are fixed by the districts authorities without differentiating between improved and&#13;
non-improved markets. Market revenue after development goes up through increased turn-over of&#13;
trading even with same unit rate. GOB does not favour unit tariff increase, as this would discourage&#13;
the poor vendors to use the unhygienic road side markets thus losing many social benefits. There are&#13;
also complaints that the leaseholders often charge more than the official tariffs from the vendors.&#13;
The higher toll would translate into higher revenues for the UPs only if the leasing system is fully&#13;
competitive, as mentioned above this is not the case and certain measures could be taken to improve&#13;
the situation such as the use of more transparent procedures and wide based competition to reduce&#13;
collusion in market leasing, with better information sharing arrangements, publicity arrangements,&#13;
tendering done by district level agencies and appropriate user participation under agreed guidelines.&#13;
Therefore it is recommended for the project to focus on developing the management capability of&#13;
market/ghat committees for operation and maintenance. The 'information sharing' approach will&#13;
contribute to this but the project will also include:&#13;
-     definition of procedures for cleaning and maintenance, removing responsibility from&#13;
the leaseholder;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 1.1&#13;

training of and advice to committees in market/ghat management, including the&#13;
preparation of maintenance plans;&#13;
monitoring of the flow of funds for, and effectiveness of, maintenance.&#13;
However, specific attention will be given to market leases as a source of funds for local revenue&#13;
generation. There are two aspects:&#13;
i)    the present allocation of market lease revenue gives only limited incentive to UPs to&#13;
generate the maximum funds from their markets and to develop those markets. The&#13;
present re-distributive mechanism to allocate some of the revenue from a large market&#13;
in a particular Union to other Unions in the Thana through the TDCC, is excessive (in&#13;
simple terms for markets with a lease revenue of more than Taka 50,000, that part of&#13;
the lease revenue which is retained at local level is allocated to the TDCC rather than&#13;
the UP);&#13;
ii)    at present the potential value of market leasing is not realised, and many of the&#13;
leaseholders make large profits - it is variously estimated that the total income from a&#13;
market is 3-11 times, and 5 times, the lease value. This is a complex socio-political&#13;
issue in the context of rural Bangladesh (one large NGO, BRAC, has become involved&#13;
in the leasing of markets but recognises that it is fraught with difficulties). However&#13;
practical possibilities have been identified:&#13;
-      leasing by users' collectives;&#13;
*     increasing the visibility and transparency of the lease bidding process.&#13;
*     monitoring of market toll revenue as a basis for assessing lease bid values.&#13;
The project includes a number of up-front actions as an interim measure before Board presentation of&#13;
the project, and further follow-up measures within about 18 months after Board presentation in the&#13;
light of further studies (funded under the project).&#13;
(a) The up front actions related to market/ghat leasing and management are given in para. 7.1 of this&#13;
annex.&#13;
(b) In addition to the above interim measures, a study on improving revenue mobilisation by UP's&#13;
including better systems for ghats and markets management and leasing should be completed by about&#13;
December 1997 (a year after IDA Board date), and its recommendations reviewed and implemented in&#13;
consultation with IDA/SDC before about June 1998. The study should examine, among other things,&#13;
(i) the case for and feasibility of increasing unit toll rates of markets after they are developed, and (ii)&#13;
suitable procedures for management of ghats with user participation, preferably on the lines of the&#13;
UMMCs.&#13;

SECOND RURAL ROAD AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT AND MAUNTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
INSTrnlUTONAL DEVELOPMENT OF&#13;
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGIEERING DEPARTMENT&#13;
1.    Introduction&#13;
LGED originated from a small cell in the Local Government Division (LGD) during the late&#13;
1970s. This led to the formation of the Works Programme Wing in 1982, and of the Local Government&#13;
Engineering Bureau in 1984, which was upgraded to a Department in 1992. LGED's task load has&#13;
increased at a very rapid rate during this period of growth. Its tasks have been widened and it now&#13;
implements a large portfolio of donor-supported and GOB financed programs. Its responsibilities&#13;
include construction and maintenance of FRBs and rural roads, drainage structures and mnarkets; small-&#13;
scale water resources schemes; construction of schools and cyclone shelters; food-aided rural&#13;
infrastructure programs; provision of technical supervision and advice to local government bodies; and&#13;
infrastructure works with pourashavas (secondary towns). Annex 1.4 gives more information about&#13;
road and market related rural infrastructure development projects being executed by LGED.&#13;
Most of the donor-financed infrastructure projects implemented by LGED include institutional&#13;
development activities. In addition:&#13;
*      sThe Institutional Support Project (ISP) of the SIDA/NORAD financed Rural Employment&#13;
Support Program (RESP) provides long-term institutional support to LGED through three units&#13;
- the Training Unit (TU), the Technical Design and Management Unit (TDMU) and the&#13;
Physical Planning and Management Unit (PPMU). The third phase of ISP was appraised in&#13;
September 1995 and the report finalised in December 1995.&#13;
*     In parallel with the RDP-18 project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is financing three&#13;
technical assistance components - Training, Maintenance Management, and the Management&#13;
Capability Strengthening Project (MANCAPS).&#13;
The aim of the first phase of MANCAPS is to carry out an institutional and management&#13;
analysis of LGED, and make recommendations for its future management development, focusing on&#13;
four issues -institutional management, institutional organisation, financial management and engineering&#13;
management. MANCAPS has prepared a draft action plan for the management strengthening of&#13;
LGED'. The MANCAPS report concludes that:&#13;
*  LGED is effective and successful in the implementation of the tasks assigned.&#13;
* Its strengths lie in teamn work, field orientation, dynamic leadership, hard work, informal decision&#13;
making, and emphasis on training and management of its external relations.&#13;
* LGED is now reaching maturity and entering a new phase in its development, where it is important&#13;
to consolidate and even further strengthen the organisation.&#13;
Draft Action Plan - Directions in Management Development of LGED. MANCAPS, March&#13;
1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77&#13;
Annex 1.2&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
*  LGED should become the most efficient delivery channel for rural and semi-urban infrastructure&#13;
development.&#13;
* With tihe rapid increase in work-load most LGED personnel are heavily loaded, and this has led to&#13;
a number of ad-hoc organisational arrangements. The current organisation has large management&#13;
spans, matrix organisational structure, and complex inter-action with ISP.&#13;
The MANCAPS study therefore recommends:&#13;
*  A comprehensive re-organisation of LGED to reduce the management span, including the&#13;
introduction of a 'circle' level of management between the 64 Districts and headquarters.&#13;
* The formation of seven departments at headquarters each headed by a Superintending Engineer,&#13;
and the creation of a second Additional Chief Engineer post.&#13;
* The integration of ISP functions into the established LGED structure including the creation of an&#13;
LGED Design Cell to prepare manuals, specifications and design standards and to provide&#13;
technical supervision and co-ordination of the work of design consultants.&#13;
* The strengthening of the planning, and management information systems (MIS) functions including&#13;
monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), and the preparation of a MIS master plan.&#13;
The existing LGED organisation structure and the organisation chart proposed by MANCAPS&#13;
are attached (Attachments 1 and 2). The IDA/SDC appraisal mission agreed with many of the&#13;
recommendations of MANCAPS and, in order to contribute to the management strengthening of LGED&#13;
a number of them will be implemented and financed under the project.&#13;
The RRMIMP-2 will finance 7 positions as incremental staff:&#13;
- The position of a second Additional Chief Engineer in charge of Design, Planning, and Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation (this position is referred to in the organisation chart as Additional Chief&#13;
Engineer - 1)&#13;
* The position of Superintending Engineer (Design, Quality control and Research and Development)&#13;
to head the Design Cell. under the second Additional Chief Engineer.&#13;
* Two Assistant Engineer positions (Roads and Structures) in the Design Cell.&#13;
* The positions of a Transport Economist and a Monitoring &amp; Evaluation expert in the Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation cell under the second Additional Chief Engineer&#13;
* The position of a Sociologist (Participation and Land Acquisition) in the Planning Cell under the&#13;
second Additional Chief Engineer.&#13;
This will contribute to institutionalising functions now taken up on a temporary basis under&#13;
Technical Assistance provided by the ISP. These positions will be funded from the GOB revenue&#13;
budget from the fifth year of the project on. This will be done in such a way as to avoid conflict or&#13;
duplication with the next phase of the ISP, and SIDA/NORAD have welcomed this participation in the&#13;
strengthening of the institutional structure of LGED.&#13;
The staffing of these positions will provide the capacity to implement institutional and human&#13;
resource development activities under the project in respect of structures and road pavement design&#13;
standards, land acquisition policy, participation in rural infrastructure development, and SEM&amp;E.&#13;
&#13;

ADB intends to fund the implementation of MANCAPS recommendations related to improved financial&#13;
management and internal auditing. The MANCAPS recommendations concerning the reduction of the&#13;
span of control through more delegation of responsibilities and the creation of regional offices (circles)&#13;
headed by Superintending Engineers, is in the process of being implemented by the Government. IDA&#13;
will seek Government's commitment on implementing main MANCAPS recommendations (see para.&#13;
2.32 in SAR).&#13;

rural infrastructure (rural roads and markets) development and maintenance&#13;
projects funded by foreign agencies and the Government. These projects are&#13;
generally designated as Rural Development Projects (RDPs) in a series, as they&#13;
are designed mainly to implement the rural development strategy which the&#13;
Government announced in 1984 (see para. 1.37 and 1.43 in the SAR). Some&#13;
of these projects have other titles, and have components other than rural&#13;
infrastructure (such as minor irrigation, schools, etc.) Table 1 of this Annex&#13;
presents the current list of these ongoing projects, their total costs, annual&#13;
allocation for the most recent year, and rough estimate of the value of rural&#13;
infrastructure components in each project. The Table shows that the total cost&#13;
of the portfolio is about 41.5 billion Taka (about US$1 billion equivalent), and&#13;
annual budget allocation (from domestic and foreign funds) about 5.4 billion&#13;
Taka; annual allocation for the infrastructure component is about 3.8 billion&#13;
Taka in 1995/96.&#13;
2.    In addition, there are food-aided rural infrastructure projects, as listed in Table&#13;
2 of this annex; this amounts to about 1.4 billion Taka in 1995/96.&#13;
(b)    Estimate of Resources needed for rural infrastructure development and maintenance&#13;
3.    The Rural Infrastructure Strategy prepared by IDA/LGED  (April 1996 -&#13;
Report No. BDSR-15732) estimates future resource requirements for&#13;
developing existing rural roads and markets over the next 10 years, as well as&#13;
the increasing maintenance costs which would go up as the road network is&#13;
upgraded. These are based on an ambitious scenario, and a "realistic scenario"&#13;
taking into account mainly implementation capacity. If funds are available, the&#13;
realistic scenario can be implemented, but this will require some increase, over&#13;
existing level, of annual development and maintenance funds available from&#13;
foreign and local sources. Tables 3 and 4 indicate the estimated resource&#13;
requirements for development (improvements) and maintenance, respectively,&#13;
under the two scenarios.&#13;

4.    The assumptions relating to Table 3 (development) are given below:&#13;
(i)    The present FRB network is 8,403 km. An additional 5,500 km of&#13;
FRB will be created from existing Rural Roads I (RR1) roads, due to&#13;
recent increase of classified growth center markets from 1,400 to&#13;
2,100. However, the size of the RR1 and Rural Roads 2 (RR2)&#13;
networks will remain unchanged because one can expect some increase&#13;
in the total length of roads, with upgrading from Rural Roads 3 (RR3)&#13;
roads.&#13;
(ii)   Ambitious Scenario:&#13;
*     All existing and additional FRBs upgraded to full bitumen-&#13;
surfaced standard, including bridging all gaps, replacing all&#13;
damaged structures, and repairing all "poor" structures.&#13;
*     20% of RR1 roads upgraded to WBM standard or equivalent&#13;
(for simplicity, it is assumed that they are all upgraded from&#13;
earthen standard).&#13;
*     All gaps on RR1 and RR2 roads bridged, all damaged&#13;
structures on RR1 and RR2 roads replaced, and all "poor"&#13;
structures on RR1 and RR2 roads repaired.&#13;
*     All unimproved Growth Center markets improved.&#13;
*     All jetties serving Growth Centers improved.&#13;
This equates to the following scope of work:&#13;
Upgrading of FRB to BC standard:        13,178 km&#13;
Construction of FRB structures:        45,897 m&#13;
Upgrading of RR1 to WBM standard&#13;
(or equivalent standard):              6,535 km&#13;
Construction of RR structures&#13;
(excluding repairs):                   232,274 m&#13;
Construction of improved markets:       1,890 markets&#13;
Construction of improved jetties:      700 jetties&#13;
The total investment cost is Taka 89,662 million (US$2,242 million).&#13;
&#13;

(iii)   Realistic Scenario:&#13;
*     80% of existing and additional FRBs upgraded to full bitumen-&#13;
surfaced standard, including bridging all gaps, replacing all&#13;
damaged structures, and repairing all "poor" structures.&#13;
*     10% of RR1 roads upgraded to WBM standard or equivalent&#13;
(for simplicity, they are all upgraded from earthen standard),&#13;
including all structures works.&#13;
*     60% of gaps on remaining RR1 and RR2 roads bridged, 60%&#13;
of damaged structures on remaining RR1 and RR2 roads&#13;
replaced, and 60% of "poor" structures on remaining RR1 and&#13;
RR2 roads repaired.&#13;
*     50% of unimproved Growth Center markets improved.&#13;
*     All jetties serving Growth Centers improved.&#13;
This equates to the following scope of work:&#13;
Upgrading of FRB to BC standard:        10,542 km&#13;
Construction of FRB structures:         36,718 m&#13;
Upgrading of RR1 to WBM standard&#13;
(or equivalent standard):              3,268 km&#13;
Construction of RR structures&#13;
(excluding repairs):                   143,300 m&#13;
Construction of improved markets:       945 markets&#13;
Construction of improved jetties:      700 jetties&#13;
The total investment cost is Taka 62,732 million (US$1,568 million).&#13;
5.    Table 3 shows that to achieve targets under the realistic scenario, which will&#13;
substantially improve the condition of rural roads and markets to good&#13;
standards, a total amount of about 63 billion Taka (in 1996 prices) would be&#13;
needed; with an average annual development expenditure of about 6.3 billion&#13;
(about US$155 million equivalent).&#13;
6.    Projected Maintenance Expenditures:  Table 4 shows estimated increase in&#13;
maintenance requirements during 1996-2006, for both scenarios. For the&#13;
'realistic scenario'. it shows that average annual maintenance for this period&#13;
would increase from 1.3 billion Taka in 1996 to about 2.9 billion Taka in&#13;
2006, which implies: annual increase of 0.16 billion Taka for maintenance, and&#13;
a cumulative annual average maintenance over the first 5-years of 1.78 billion&#13;
Taka, and a cumulative average maintenance over 10 years of 2.1 billion Taka.&#13;

(c)    Estimate of currently Available resources for rural infrastructure&#13;
7.     The main sources of funds at present (for development and maintenance) are&#13;
discussed below. They total an average (based on the last two years) of Taka&#13;
6.3 billion. About 54% of this is from foreign sources, and 46% domestic&#13;
resources (see para. 9 below). It is expected that because of the good design of&#13;
these projects focused on key rural infrastructure and their poverty-orientation,&#13;
efficient management, and the continuing high poverty level of the country,&#13;
this level of foreign assistance would continue in future. The present annual&#13;
development spending is about 5.4% of the country's annual development&#13;
budget (foreign and domestic).&#13;
(i)    Block Grant for Union and Thana Development&#13;
The nationwide block grant from Government's budget for FY94/95&#13;
was Taka 1,500 million, and for FY95/96 Taka 2,000 million. The&#13;
conditions applied to this Block Grant state that 25%-60% should be&#13;
allocated to the "transport and communications sector - roads, bridges,&#13;
culverts, etc". Thus, the maximum funds available from this resource&#13;
for rural transport infrastructure works are:&#13;
FY94/95:      Taka 900 million&#13;
FY95/96:      Taka 1,200 million&#13;
However, different Unions and Thanas will have different priorities for&#13;
use of the Block Grant.  Therefore, it is considered reasonable to&#13;
estimate the resources available for rural transport infrastructure on the&#13;
basis of the median figure, i.e., 42.5% of the Block Grant. This gives&#13;
resources of:&#13;
FY94/95:      Taka 637.5 million&#13;
FY95/96:      Taka 850 million&#13;
Note: Some infrastructure projects require local contributions from the&#13;
Union Parishads, and the main source of this local financing is the&#13;
Block Grant. Care has been taken to avoid double-counting in the&#13;
estimates provided in this note).&#13;
(ii)    LGED Revenue Budget for Maintenance&#13;
Governments' regular revenue budget allocation for rural road&#13;
maintenance (all spent through LGED) maintenance is as follows:&#13;
FY94/95:      Taka 550 million&#13;
FY95/96:      Taka 650 million&#13;
100% of this allocation is utilized for maintenance works.&#13;

(iii)   Donor and Government Financed Rural Infrastructure Projects (RDPs&#13;
and others)&#13;
The Donor and Government Financed Rural Infrastructure Projects,&#13;
excluding those using international food-aid, are listed in Table 1. The&#13;
percentage of the total budget allocation applied to physical&#13;
infrastructure works has been estimated in Table 1 on the following&#13;
assumptions:&#13;
i.     RDPs, and similar donor-supported projects which emphasize&#13;
roads or roads and markets, 70%;&#13;
ii.    donor-supported projects in other sectors, but which include&#13;
roads, 30%; and&#13;
iii.    GOB-financed projects, 90%.&#13;
These estimates are intended to exclude any local contributions from&#13;
the Block Grant, in order to avoid double-counting. Based on this&#13;
analysis the Project Funds for rural infrastructure works, excluding&#13;
food-aid, are:&#13;
FY94/95:       Taka 3,328 million&#13;
FY95/96:       Taka 3,835 million&#13;
(iv)   International Food-Aided Infrastructure Projects&#13;
There are five international food-aided rural transport infrastructure&#13;
projects in LGED  at present, which are listed in Table 2.  This&#13;
includes the CIDA funded Road Maintenance Project (RMP) which&#13;
focuses on rural roads maintenance through employment of destitute&#13;
women in the villages, and it is important part of the rural road&#13;
maintenance program.&#13;
(v)    Summary of Available Resources (development and maintenance)&#13;
The estimated resources available for rural infrastructure (development&#13;
and maintenance) are summarized below:&#13;
Item                        1994/95          1995/96&#13;
1. Block Grant for Union and Thana Development  637              850&#13;
2. Revenue Budget for Maintenance               550              650&#13;
3. Food-Aid                                     1,417           1,420&#13;
4. Project Funds                                3,328           3,835&#13;
Total                        5,932            6,755&#13;
The average annual figure over the two financial years is Taka 6,343 million.&#13;

8.     Road Maintenance Resources&#13;
Based on the above analysis and using the 1995/96 data, the funds available for&#13;
road maintenance can be estimated as follows. (These exclude maintenance of&#13;
markets, which are generally fully covered, by markets own lease revenue).&#13;
Block Grant:                  Taka 42.5 million&#13;
LGED Revenue Budget:          Taka 650 million&#13;
Food Aid (RMP):               Taka 455 million&#13;
UP Contribution to RMP:       Taka 45.5 million&#13;
Project Funds:                Taka 120 million&#13;
Total:                        Taka 1,313 million&#13;
This estimate is derived as follows:&#13;
(i)    5 % of Block Grant for transport infrastructure is assumed to be&#13;
used for maintenance in addition to UP contribution to RMP;&#13;
(ii)    100% of LGED revenue budget for maintenance;&#13;
(iii)    Food-aid is the RMP expenditure funded through CIDA;&#13;
(iv)    UPs make a 10% matching contribution to the RMP from their&#13;
own revenue;&#13;
(v)    Project funds. - it is estimated that, out of the 1995/96 ADP&#13;
allocation to infrastructure development projects (including&#13;
donor financed projects) of about $150 million, about 2% is&#13;
spent on maintenance.&#13;
These amounts totaling 1.3 billion Taka are adequate to meet&#13;
present maintenance needs, but has to go up significantly to&#13;
meet future needs (Para. 6). Of the current total maintenance&#13;
expenditure, 575 million Taka (about 44%) is from foreign aid.&#13;
(d)    Share of foreignldomestic resources&#13;
9.     With reference to the 1995-96 fund allocations, the share of domestic resources&#13;
is estimated below.&#13;

expenditures (1995-96) are given below:&#13;

Domestic Funding           2345                735                 3083&#13;
(43%)               (56%)               (46%)&#13;
Foreign Funding            3097                575                 3672&#13;
(57%)               (44%)               (54%)&#13;
Total Funding              5442                1313                6755&#13;
(100%)              (100%)              (100%)&#13;
11.    With reference to these figures, the following observations can be made:&#13;
(i)    The 43 % domestic share for development for rural infrastructure is&#13;
higher than the domestic share in total development budget. The share&#13;
of domestic contribution with Annual Development Program (ADP) for&#13;
1995-96 was 37%.&#13;
(ii)    Domestic share for maintenance is even higher (56%). Overall&#13;
domestic funding for the sector is about 3 times the total maintenance&#13;
expenditure required (about 1315 million Taka, see para. 6). The&#13;
share of foreign expenditure in maintenance is largely from RMP&#13;
which is a well-designed poverty-targeted, food-aided program which&#13;
may continue under RRMIMP-2 project, it is being agreed with&#13;
Government that they would provide alternative funds to sustain&#13;
maintenance, in case there is reduction in RMP allocation in future (see&#13;
also para. 13).&#13;
(iii)   The domestic funds for development in 1995-96 (pre-election budget)&#13;
was about 500 million Taka more than in the previous year budget.&#13;
(iv)   Annual development allocation for rural roads/markets (5.4 billion&#13;
Taka) in 1995/96 is about 5.4% of the country's total development&#13;
budget (covering foreign and domestic resources).&#13;
12.    Annual Future  Needs (development and  maintenance) under Realistic&#13;
Scenario: Annual future resource requirements (using 5-year maintenance&#13;
average) would be 8.1 billion (see paras. 5 and 6); as against this, the current&#13;
level of resource availability is about 6.8 billion (54% foreign, 46% domestic;&#13;
see para. 9); this indicates the need for about 19% increase in annual&#13;
resources to meet future needs if Bangladesh is to meet the realistic 10-year&#13;
targets proposed in the Strategy Paper. The implementation capacity exists for&#13;
this level. The increase in financial resources needed would seem justified in&#13;
view of the proven major economic and poverty alleviation impacts of such&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;

(e)    Estimate of minimum Government budget allocation needed for future maintenance&#13;
(during the project period)&#13;
13.   As noted in para. 5, as the road network is improved, the future maintenance&#13;
requirements will increase from about 1,300 million Taka in 1996 to about&#13;
2,900 million Taka in 2006. The current maintenance needs are fully met from&#13;
various sources, including 650 million Taka from Government's budget for&#13;
rural infrastructure and maintenance allocated to LGED (para. 8). The&#13;
minimum level of Government budget allocation needed during the project&#13;
period, discussed in SAR para. 2.17, is estimated on an approximate basis as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Annual increase needed during the 10-year period to reach "realistic scenario"&#13;
targets: (2,900 million - 1,300 million = 1,600/10 = 160 million Taka).&#13;
Assuming only 80% development targets would be met (because of resource&#13;
constraint), the increase in maintenance level will be 128 million Taka. Of&#13;
this, 25% increase is expected from UP's resources and the rest about 96&#13;
million Taka from increase in budget allocation. Adjusting for inflation, an&#13;
annual about 100 million Taka (about US$2.5 million) is assumed as minimum&#13;
increase needed from the 1995-96 level of 650 million Taka (about US$16&#13;
million): 750 million Taka in 1996-97; this implies 850 million Taka (US$21&#13;
million equivalent) in 1997-98, and thereafter at an annual increment of&#13;
US$2.5 million equivalent to the last project year (2001-2002).&#13;

SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
IMPACT OF RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.    The IFPRI Study&#13;
A major study on the impact of rural infrastructure development in Bangladesh, carried out by the&#13;
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) with the Bangladesh Institute of Development&#13;
Studies (BIDS) was published in 19901. This study surveyed 129 villages which were classified as&#13;
"developed" and "undeveloped" based on an infrastructure index which considered access to transport,&#13;
markets, schools, banks, modem inputs, electricity, and local administrative offices. From this sample&#13;
16 villages, seven "developed" and nine "undeveloped", were selected and detailed household surveys&#13;
conducted. The study found that, comparing the two categories, the villages with "developed"&#13;
infrastructure were significantly better off in a number of areas:&#13;
*     Farmgate prices of rice were 7 % higher.&#13;
--    Fertilizer prices were 14% lower and fertilizer utilization was 92% higher.&#13;
105% more land was irrigated and 71% more sown with HYV seeds.&#13;
Household income was 8% higher.&#13;
*;    The wage rate was 12% higher.&#13;
There were particular benefits for the poor - wage income of landless laborers was 36%&#13;
higher, and the proportion of female workers was 135% higher.&#13;
2.    Impact of FRB Road Improvements&#13;
There is increasing emphasis on socio-economic monitoring and evaluation (SEM&amp;E) activities in the&#13;
Rural Development Projects implemented by LGED. Through the SEM&amp;E activities of different&#13;
projects, a data-base of time-series information on the effect of FRB improvements on traffic (traffic&#13;
level; modal mix; and frequency, reliability and cost of transport services) is progressively being&#13;
accumulated. It is these changes in traffic, resulting from the road improvements, that generate the&#13;
longer-term economic and social impacts of the investments.&#13;
The evidence from the SEM&amp;E work, including that carried out under the RRMIMP, is that FRB road&#13;
improvements to all-weather standard result in a growth of motorized and non-motorized vehicular&#13;
traffic and some transfer of pedestrian trips to more efficient motorized and non-motorized modes, a&#13;
reduction in transport charges and an increase in the total movement of goods and people. Provision of&#13;
an all-weather road tends to stimulate the operation of bus services (except on short roads) and auto-&#13;
rickshaw (tempo) services. Use of rickshaw services also tends to increase, but rickshaw traffic grows&#13;
at a slower rate than motorized services. However the use of bullock carts on the FRBs tends to&#13;
decline.&#13;

Annex 1.4&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
The FRB road investments under the ongoing RRMIMP project have already had a demonstrable socio-&#13;
economic impact, as a result of increased traffic volumes, a switch to more efficient modes of&#13;
transport, and reduced transport costs. Based on the SEM&amp;E survey of nine completed project roads in&#13;
the first year of project completion (1995):&#13;
*     Total traffic volumes (passenger-km and tonne-km) on the nine roads increased by 120% for&#13;
passengers and 300% for goods. This data set includes one road where there was a huge&#13;
increase in goods traffic volume. However, comparing the median values passenger traffic&#13;
volume increased by 100% and goods traffic volume by 140%.&#13;
*     Average daily motorized traffic on the nine roads increased by 154%. The major increases&#13;
were in buses (from zero to 14 vehicles per day), motor cycles (178% increase) and auto&#13;
rickshaws (100%). Non-motorized traffic increased by 90%, the major increase being in&#13;
passenger rickshaws and rickshaw vans (197%). Bullock cart traffic decreased by 54%.&#13;
*     Average unit transport costs decreased by 69% for passengers and 48% for cargo. The benefits&#13;
to rickshaw operation of a smooth running surface are shown by the fact that the transport&#13;
charges of rickshaw van operators reduced by nearly 40%.&#13;
The same study also showed that along improved roads compared to non-improved roads, net farm&#13;
income is about 9% higher, cropping intensity 1-2% higher, and fertilizer and pesticide use&#13;
respectively 4-5% and 34% higher. The overall economic return from  the road improvement&#13;
investments is about 26% based on partial benefits of transport cost savings.&#13;
The report of findings from the monitoring of the first phase of RDP-14, the GTZ-financed Tangail&#13;
Infrastructure Development Project, was published at the end of 19942. Its findings on the impact of&#13;
improving FRB roads to bitumen-surfaced standard are as follows:&#13;
*     Within one year of FRB improvement, transport charges decreased significantly. Average&#13;
passenger charges dropped by 18.7%, and average cargo charges by 23.3%. The most&#13;
significant decreases in charges were for passenger rickshaws and rickshaw vans.&#13;
*     On two FRB roads where improvements had been initiated at the start of the monitoring study&#13;
and were essentially complete by the end of the study, the total number of road users (based on&#13;
average daily traffic) increased by 43% over a period of about one year, the number of non-&#13;
motorized vehicle trips increased by 85% and the number of motor vehicle trips by 135 %. The&#13;
number of pedestrian trips declined. Regular bus services had commnenced on one of the roads.&#13;
These traffic growth rates can be compared with an average of 12.7% normal annual growth of&#13;
non-motorized traffic over a ten-year period, and 7.0% for motor vehicles, derived from a&#13;
control road where traffic counts were taken in 1984 and 1994.&#13;
Performance monitoring of RDP-6 roads commenced with monsoon season traffic counts in 1993,&#13;
which are repeated twice per year. The latest findings3, derived from four rounds of traffic counting,&#13;
are that:&#13;

The market improvements result in a reduction in crop spoilage of 2-4% of the value of the&#13;
crops marketed due to better protection from the elements and faster sales turnover. This is&#13;
sufficient to generate a 12 % EIRR from the investment in market improvements.&#13;
*     Between 1992 and 1994 there were increases in all eight markets in the number of sellers&#13;
attending (41%), the total turnover of the markets (48%) and the number of permanent shops&#13;
(18%). In four&#13;
of the eight markets the market turnover increased by substantially more than the number of&#13;
sellers. However in three of the markets the situation was reversed, with increased competition&#13;
among sellers to market their goods.&#13;
*     Between 1992 and 1994 the auction lease value increased in seven of the eight markets, by an&#13;
average of 35%. Toll collection increased by an average of 70%.&#13;
The findings from the monitoring of the first phase of RDP-14 in respect of the effects of improving&#13;
facilities at Growth Center markets are as follows:&#13;
For the three markets improved, auction lease value has increased by nearly 100% compared&#13;
with 28% for Growth Center markets in the District as a whole.&#13;
Land prices in the vicinity of the markets have increased by more than 180%.&#13;
The average daily number of market visitors has increased by 22%.&#13;
The total cargo brought for sale has increased by 24%, with an increase in estimated weekly&#13;
market turnover of 71 %.&#13;
The monitoring of the RDP-4 project examined the changes that resulted from improvement of Growth&#13;
Center markets. The main conclusions are that:&#13;
The number of permanent shops doubled between the benchmark and final surveys, the total&#13;
number of shops increased, and they were open for more days per week, indicating that the&#13;
Growth Centers are developing as commercial trading centers.&#13;
The number of visitors to Growth Center markets increased by 31 % on market days and 23%&#13;
on non-market days.&#13;
It should of course be noted that the significant increases in the level of economic activity in improved&#13;
markets result from the combination of the improvements to the market and the better road access, ie.&#13;
from the integrated development of the rural transport and trading network.&#13;
4.    Employment Generation&#13;
An important impact of rural infrastructure development projects is on direct and indirect employment&#13;
and income generation. It is estimated that, up to and including the 1994/95 Financial Year, 15 rural&#13;
infrastructure projects implemented by LGED have created some 70 million person-days of direct paid&#13;
employment on implementation of project activities. This does not include the direct employment&#13;
created on the various food-for-work programs implemented by LGED.&#13;
Longer-term employment and income-generation opportunities are created from the stimulus that the&#13;
improvement of infrastructure gives to agricultural production and to other economic activities:&#13;

and income generation. It is estimated that, up to and including the 1994/95 Financial Year, 15 rural&#13;
infrastructure projects implemented by LGED have created some 70 million person-days of direct paid&#13;
employment on implementation of project activities. This does not include the direct employment&#13;
created on the various food-for-work programs implemented by LGED.&#13;
Longer-term employment and income-generation opportunities are created from the stimulus that the&#13;
improvement of infrastructure gives to agricultural production and to other economic activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98&#13;
Annex 1.4&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
*      The RDP-14 monitoring study concludes that more than 2,700 permanent jobs have been&#13;
created indirectly as a result of the project infrastructure investments, most of them in the&#13;
expansion of transport operations but also in newly-established shops and workshops along the&#13;
improved FRB roads and near the improved markets.&#13;
The RDP-4 monitoring study estimated that, in addition to short-term direct employment on&#13;
project activities, long-term employment in the project area had increased by about 14% (the&#13;
majority in the non-agricultural sector) over the three-year period of the survey from 1989&#13;
to 1992. While the infrastructure investment had contributed to this, it was difficult to isolate&#13;
its impact from that of other initiatives in the area.&#13;
5.     Macro-Economic Analysis&#13;
As part of the IDA/LGED Rural Infrastructure Strategy Study7, macro-level analysis of the rural road&#13;
network has been carried out. There is a close association between the spatial distribution of good rural&#13;
roads across the country and the distribution of agricultural production densities, showing that&#13;
Govermment's past policies under the Strategy for Rural Development Projects, and the resulting&#13;
regional investments, have led to a generally rational distribution of resources.&#13;
An analysis of the relationship between agricultural productivity and the condition of the rural road&#13;
network has been carried out, using a nationwide District-level regression model. The key findings are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
*      With statistical significance at the 5 % and 1 % confidence levels respectively, the densities of&#13;
good Feeder roads and paved Rural Roads have positive productivity elasticities. The analysis&#13;
suggests that an increase of 10% in the density of good Feeder roads is associated with an&#13;
increase of almost 1 % in agricultural productivity. The same increase in the density of paved&#13;
Rural Roads is associated with a 0.5 % increase in agricultural productivity.&#13;
*      Analysis using the density of all rural roads does not yield significant results, indicating that it&#13;
is the condition, not the extent of the network that is important.&#13;
*      There is a negative relationship between agricultural productivity and gap density (measured as&#13;
the number of gaps per km of FRB and Rural Road).&#13;

SELECTION CRITERIA, IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES AND&#13;
TIME FRAME FOR PHYSICAL COMPONENTS&#13;
A.    Procedures Used in the Selection of FRBs, Growth Centre Markets and Ghats&#13;
1.    The FRB, market and ghat investment schemes have been selected (as listed in Annex 2.2)&#13;
using the 6-step procedure which is summarised below:&#13;
1.1    An inventory was prepared of all FRB roads and Growth Centre markets in the project&#13;
area. The inventory of Growth Centres included those designated in the early 1980s&#13;
and the additional markets designated as Growth Centres in 1993. In preparing the&#13;
inventory a strict definition of FRBs eligible for consideration under the project was&#13;
applied, based on two criteria:&#13;
(a) All FRBs should connect to a Growth Centre located remote from the RHD road&#13;
network;&#13;
(b) No Growth Centre should have more than one FRB road connection.&#13;
1.2    The inventory of FRB roads and Growth Centres was then screened to prepare ong&#13;
lists of 'possible' investment schemes excluding all FRBs and markets included in the&#13;
RRMIMP and RDP-6 projects', all other FRBs improved to good, all-weather bitumen-&#13;
surfaced standard under other programs, and all Growth Centre markets under the&#13;
Pourashava Parishad or at serious risk from erosion.&#13;
1.3    Using the long-list of possible schemes as the starting point, participatory meetings&#13;
were organised in each of the 97 Thanas in the project area, attended by local&#13;
representatives including Union Parishad members, NGOs and beneficiaries. At these&#13;
meetings the local representatives were requested to discuss, reach a consensus on, and&#13;
rank, their priorities for FRB and Growth Centre markets. They were also asked to&#13;
identify priority ghats for improvement in the Thana. The meetings were facilitated by&#13;
the preparation consultants' staff, but the consensus and decisions were reached by&#13;
local representatives through open debate. During this field work consultations were&#13;
also held with TNOs, LGED staff and some Members of Parliament.&#13;
1.4    The locally-defined priorities were used to prepare short-lists of 'probable' FRB&#13;
upgrading and Growth Centre market improvement schemes. The short-lists were&#13;
based on indicative targets for the extent and distribution of the physical investment&#13;
schemes across the project area, aimed at achieving approximately equivalent coverage&#13;
at project-end in relation to the infrastructure needs of the Northwest Region and the&#13;
Three FRB roads which RDP-6 will upgrade only to HBB standard were included for possible bitumen-&#13;
surfacing.&#13;
&#13;

Greater Dhaka Area. In preparing the short-lists the greatest weight was given to the&#13;
locally-defined priorities determined during the participatory meetings. However some&#13;
adjustments were made to reflect rational selection criteria, as follows:&#13;
(a)    Most FRBs less than 2km long were excluded;&#13;
(b)    A few FRBs were added where particular requests had been made and where&#13;
initial field investigations indicated that the roads were important;&#13;
(c)    Growth Centre markets located very close to existing, improved markets were&#13;
excluded;&#13;
(d)    Some priority was given to complementing existing RRMIMP investments by&#13;
short-listing unimproved Growth Centre markets located on FRBs improved&#13;
under the RRMIMP; and&#13;
(e)    Priority was given to short-listing both FRBs and the markets that they serve,&#13;
but in some cases FRBs were short-listed without the accompanying market.&#13;
1.5   a)     All short-listed FRBs were subjected to detailed economic appraisal, based on&#13;
initial inventory surveys to prepare estimates of improvement costs, and on&#13;
traffic surveys to provide the data for estimation of economic benefits. The&#13;
final list of selected FRBs was made based on the results of the economic&#13;
analysis, rejecting all roads with an EIRR of less than 12% and selecting those&#13;
with the highest EIRRs.&#13;
b)     Economic and physical data was collected from the field for all short-listed&#13;
Growth Centre markets and for all ghats identified locally as priorities. The&#13;
final list of selected Growth Centre markets was derived from the short-list,&#13;
primarily based on the locally-identified priorities but:&#13;
(i)    Eliminating any markets located on FRB which do not provide, and&#13;
which will not be upgraded under the project to provide, all-weather access;&#13;
(ii)    Choosing between alternatives where adjacent Thanas had prioritised&#13;
markets located very close together - in such cases the more important market&#13;
was chosen based on the economic data collected; and&#13;
(iii) Eliminating certain markets where the field data raised serious doubts&#13;
about viability of improvement, most commonly where the available land area&#13;
is very small, or where the market has very low lease value, attendance and&#13;
turnover.&#13;
c)    The final list of selected ghats was made, from the priorities identified by local&#13;
representatives, as follows:&#13;
(i)    Since most of the priority ghats serve markets, all ghats serving&#13;
Growth Centre markets selected for improvement under the project or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
101                                Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
improved under RRMIMP were included except where the utilisation of the&#13;
ghat is very low; and&#13;
(ii)   The more important of the remaining ghats were selected, importance&#13;
being defined in terms of throughput of boats and use for river transport rather&#13;
than simply for cross-river ferry services.&#13;
1.6   The TDCCs were subsequently requested by LGED, through the TNOs, to confirm&#13;
their agreement with the selection of the investment schemes which was subsequently&#13;
confirmed after voting by each TDCC. Such formal approval is required under&#13;
Government's procedures.&#13;
B.    Criteria for Selection of New Components or Revision of List of Selected ComDonents&#13;
2.    FRBs. Growth Centre Markets and Ghats&#13;
2.1    General: It is recognised that the FRB roads, growth centre markets and ghats for&#13;
inclusion in the project have been pre-selected during the appraisal process, as listed in&#13;
Annex 2.2, and as discussed in Section A above. The following selection criteria&#13;
would be used in case new FRB roads, growth centre markets or ghats are to be added&#13;
to the project either as new items or as replacement of existing locations in the list. It&#13;
is expected that such changes in the list in Annex 2.2 would be made only during mid-&#13;
term review or later, unless otherwise agreed. The selection criteria are listed below:&#13;

vii. GOB will: (a) cause ghat management committee to be established for all&#13;
developed ghats modelled on market management committee;  (b) ensure that&#13;
operation of these ghats and markets will have adequate user participation.&#13;
3.    Selection of Structures on Other FRBs (i.e. FRBs not selected for full development)&#13;
Except as otherwise agreed with the Association, for purposes of Part A of the Project, the&#13;
selection of structures to be constructed on other FRBs shall be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
procedures and criteria set forth below.&#13;
3.1    General Procedure:&#13;
LGED, with the assistance of the preparation consultants, and in consultation with&#13;
user groups and TDCC, will select the structures to be included in this sub-component,&#13;
and prepare the annual construction program, for approval by the IDA prior to project-&#13;
start. Each scheme will comprise construction of one or more structures on a particular&#13;
FRB road. The annual construction program will be drawn from the selected schemes&#13;
but, in the same manner as for other components where schemes have been pre-&#13;
selected, some modifications to the pre-selected schemes could be made under mutual&#13;
agreement between LGED and IDA.&#13;
3.2    Criteria:&#13;
(a)    Each proposed structure must either bridge an existing gap or replace a poor or&#13;
damaged structure on an FRB road, all as defined in the LGED road inventory.&#13;
It could also be new structure for improving cross-drainage between farming&#13;
areas.&#13;
(b)    The FRB  road on which the proposed structure or structures will be&#13;
constructed must (i) serve a Growth Centre Market located remote from the&#13;
FRB road network and (ii) be the most important road serving the Growth&#13;
Centre Market.&#13;
(c)    The construction of the proposed structure or structures must result in a&#13;
continuous FRB alignment between a Growth Centre Market and the Thana&#13;
HQ/RHD network which, at the minimum, is passable by motor vehicles in the&#13;
dry season and by non-motorised transport throughout the year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104                                 Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
(d)    Each proposed structure that exceeds 30 linear metres in span shall be subject&#13;
to an economic appraisal and a minimum 12% EIRR.&#13;
4.    Selection of Structures on Rural Roads (SRR)&#13;
4.1    General:      The SRR Component will comprise the construction of small structures&#13;
to span existing gaps, replace damaged structures or provide additional drainage&#13;
structures to allow new cross-drainage where required on RR1 and RR2 roads ( also&#13;
R3 roads if&#13;
local communities prefer them), together with ancillary earthworks on the roads. Each&#13;
scheme will comprise of a length of RR1/RR2/RR3 road plus the structure(s) to be&#13;
constructed on it. All schemes will be selected through participation of the local&#13;
government bodies, rural communities and other user groups - using the 'Information&#13;
Sharing' and 'Users Input' approaches (see annex on community participation), and all&#13;
formal proposals for investment will be submitted to the project by the Union&#13;
Parishads. The proposed scheme should meet the following criteria:&#13;
4.2    General Criteria:&#13;
a)    The proposed scheme must increase the connectivity of the Rural Road network, i.e.&#13;
the implementation of the scheme should result in a continuous alignment of road,&#13;
passable by wheeled vehicles, and serving a rural area and connecting it either to an&#13;
important local place or to a higher level of the road network which is also a&#13;
continuous alignment passable by wheeled vehicles. Alternatively, it could be for&#13;
improving cross-drainage where an existing road embankment blocks such drainage.&#13;
b)    Schemes will be limited to rural drainage structures (culverts and small bridges not&#13;
exceeding 20 m length) on rural roads, ancillary earth works on rural roads (as&#13;
approaches to the structures or elsewhere on the rural roads) will be included for an&#13;
amount of 15% of the cost of the drainage structures.&#13;
c)    The proposed scheme must not be scheduled to be taken up under any other program.&#13;
d)    This will be a national program.  All Union Parishads (UPs) will be allowed to&#13;
participate on a first come-first-served basis, according to the date of registration. The&#13;
participating UP has to deposit an initial Tk.10,000 into LGED SRR account for&#13;
registration. LGED will undertake to provide the completed structure within one year&#13;
of registration. This guarantee will apply only to the first 1500 structures registered for&#13;
each year, because of possible capacity limitations, and further there may also be a&#13;
limit on the total number of structures per UP.&#13;
e)     After registration, LGED  will inspect the selected site and make drawings and&#13;
estimates and discuss with the UP choices of types and cost estimates. After selection&#13;
by the UP, LGED Thana Engineer will invite bids from small contractors and eligible&#13;
labour contracting societies (LCS)/Labour Groups, and select lowest evaluated bidder&#13;
following usual procedures acceptable to IDA.  Earthworks outside the structure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
105                                 Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
approaches will be awarded to LCSs/labour groups of poor women/landless labourers&#13;
based on negotiated contracts and unit rates under procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
f)    Before award of contract, the UP must deposit the remaining contribution (above the&#13;
initial deposit) to LGED's SRR account. UP's total contribution will be 10% of total&#13;
costs (structure plus 15 % added as ancillary earth works for road improvements/spot&#13;
improvements) during the first three years of the project (tentatively from July 1996 to&#13;
June 1999) and 20% for the next (last) two years of the project. UP's who deposit&#13;
funds for registration before December 31, 1998 (allowing some lead time for&#13;
construction period), will be eligible for the 10% rate, and those who register after this&#13;
date will have to pay at 20% of costs. Government will contribute 10% when UP&#13;
contribution is 10%, so that total domestic contribution is 20%.&#13;
g)     The site will be selected by UPs through a participatory process involving two stages:&#13;
(i) selection by UP residents through a public meeting for discussing alternatives using&#13;
user-inputs techniques (such as, map-making etc.), most likely with assistance of&#13;
LGED's community organisers (which assistance may not be available in all cases). (ii)&#13;
Voting by UP council on the proposed sites.&#13;
h)    The UP should undertake to provide for regular maintenance of the structures and&#13;
earthworks.&#13;
i)     UP's should agree to provide to LGED data regarding extent of the funding done&#13;
through new resource mobilisation, data on employment of the poor, length of road&#13;
made passable, and also some data on traffic growth (All these through a proforma to&#13;
be filled on completion of works and a year after completion).&#13;
j)     UP should contribute its share partly in advance as described earlier. It can raise new&#13;
resources (preferred method) or use UP's ADP allocation or other revenues.&#13;
5.    Selection of Other Components: (such as small rural markets) would be according to selection&#13;
criteria to be agreed between LGED and IDA.&#13;
C.    Monitoring of Land Acquisition&#13;
6.1    LGD will set up a committee headed by a Deputy Secretary (who will directly report to&#13;
the LGD Secretary) with representatives from LGED, which will: (i) ensure that the Ministry's&#13;
administrative approval is given within seven days of request by LGED; (ii) liaise with respective&#13;
district commissioners to speed up the process of land acquisition and compensation. LGED will report&#13;
to IDA monthly on progress of these actions.&#13;
D.    Participatorv Processes&#13;
7.1    The project components, to be eligible, should use participatory approach in selecting&#13;
components; and as far as feasible in design and implementation of the project. Main&#13;
project components (roads, river jetties, markets), have already been selected using&#13;
active involvement of beneficiaries; changes in these lists will be done through&#13;
participatory processes defined earlier in this annex. (see also Annex 2.3 in SAR which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106                                Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 8 of 8&#13;
describes participation processes in more details). Rural structures will be selected&#13;
using specially designed participatory processes and "user input" techniques. In the&#13;
case of growth center markets, the design of facilities will be done in full day meetings&#13;
with vendors and others who would be the main users of these market facilities; they&#13;
will also be given a key role in managing the markets (regarding level of user charges,&#13;
auctioning of market lease, maintenance arrangements and funding), through market&#13;
committees of users, reporting every six months to an "assembly" of market users,&#13;
with special emphasis on information sharing. These procedures would be reviewed&#13;
during project implementation with IDA, and changes if necessary will be agreed. For&#13;
road components, user committees will be set up to give feed back on design and&#13;
quality of on-going works.&#13;
7.2    To ensure the participatory process to be more transparent and well implemented, the&#13;
project would finance 17 positions of local specialists in community participation&#13;
(sociologists or equivalent) and one consultant with international and local experience;&#13;
of these one community specialist will be placed in each project district, and three&#13;
community specialists (supervisors) will be assigned to advise and assist the Project&#13;
Director and LGED headquarters. In addition, suitable LGED personnel at Thana level&#13;
will be trained as "community organizers". These positions will be filled by March 31,&#13;
1997.  Services of NGO's would also be used, as needed, in promoting the&#13;
participation process, particularly in market/ghat planning.&#13;
7.3    The participation specialists will also assist poor workers and destitute women to&#13;
organize labor contracting societies (to work as contractors in labor based road works&#13;
and road maintenance) in two pilot districts, with the help of NGOs. However,&#13;
selection/formation of LCS will have to be recognized by UPs.&#13;
7.4   In addition, LGED, during project implementation, will pilot, with the help of NGO's&#13;
as needed, new methods for community-level participation in road maintenance in at&#13;
least two pilot districts, and provide a report on its findings. This pilot program will be&#13;
started, in consultation with IDA, before June 30, 1998, and a report on lessons&#13;
learned will be provided to IDA before December 31, 2000.&#13;
7.5    LGED will also set up by December 31, 1997, District level road user committees with&#13;
representatives from different user groups to promote information sharing and selection&#13;
of priorities and to facilitate feed back from users on quality of ongoing works.&#13;
7.6    To enhance participation of women, LGED would nominate one of its senior staff(the&#13;
sociologist in the LGED headquarter's office provided as incremental staff) to look&#13;
after gender issues. LGED has also agreed to recruit more women engineers as its staff&#13;
and to give special emphasis to training of women members of UPs under its&#13;
participation training programs under the project so as to strengthen their role in local&#13;
development matters. LGED/UPs will also help increase the number of women&#13;
members in the market and ghat user committees.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT AND MAIENANCE PROJECT&#13;
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN THIE PROJECT&#13;
RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.    Introduction&#13;
Participation of major stakeholders and beneficiaries has been incorporated into the design of the&#13;
project from the start of preparation. The Feeder Roads, markets and ghats for improvement have&#13;
already been selected through a process of participation to identify local priorities (see Annex 2.1).&#13;
The remaining components will follow similar procedures. During the course of project preparation,&#13;
major opportunities have been identified to expand the scope of participation. SAR, paragraphs 3.1 to&#13;
3.5 sunmmarize the main participatory features of the projects.&#13;
It is a very fortunate situation for the project preparation that all parties are very positive about the&#13;
participatory approach. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) has become an&#13;
enthusiastic promoter of the participatory approach; this is very important because co-ordination by&#13;
LGED at the national level ensures that successful approaches will be replicated in the whole country.&#13;
Also the National Planning Commission has made participation a major emphasis of their new&#13;
development plan under preparation. This is clearly implied by the title of the document under&#13;
preparation: "Participatory Perspective Plan for Bangladesh 1995 2010".&#13;
As part of the preparation work a series of studies have been carried out on different aspects of&#13;
participation, the findings of which are presented in four working papers produced in early 19951. This&#13;
note, which supplements discussions in SAR (paragraphs 3.1 to 3.5), summarises the findings from the&#13;
work on participation, and the participatory measures that will be applied in the implementation of the&#13;
different components of the project.&#13;
2.    Context&#13;
*     In the context of LGED rural infrastructure development activities, there is an array of&#13;
stakeholders in participation:&#13;
LGED, and its staff at HQ, District and Thana level.&#13;
The rural communities such as rural social leaders, landless men and women, men and&#13;
women professionals, destitute men and women, etc.&#13;
Particular target and interest groups among the rural communities - e.g. poor women&#13;
and men, men and women market users, boat operators, lessees, etc.&#13;
'Community Participation in Rural Infrastructure Development' by Dr. Dee Jupp.&#13;
'Use of Labour Contracting Societies in Rural Infrastructures' by Mr. Mohammed Faizullah.&#13;
'Financing Local Level Infrastructures' by Mr. Mohammed Faizullah.&#13;

Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
-      NGOs, youth clubs, women's organisations etc., who may have a role to play in&#13;
particular aspects of participation.&#13;
-      Local government bodies - Union Parishads (UP) including their women members,&#13;
Thana Development Co-ordination Committees (TDCC), Market Management&#13;
Committees (MMC) including women representatives, and Ghat Management&#13;
Committees (GMC).&#13;
-      Officials of Central Government working at local level - Deputy Commissioner (DC),&#13;
Thana Nirbahi Officer (TNO), District Women Affairs Officer etc.&#13;
-      Local Government Division (LGD) responsible for local government, and National&#13;
Institute of Local Government (NILG).&#13;
-      Project Beneficiaries: including users of rural roads, structures, markets, river jetties,&#13;
i.e. most of the rural population in the project areas.&#13;
*      There are four levels of Participation:&#13;
1.    Information Sharing&#13;
2.     Consultation&#13;
3.     Shared Control over Decision-Making&#13;
4.     Initiation of Action&#13;
Participation should be perceived as encompassing all aspects of rural infrastructure&#13;
development. However it must be practical and manageable, and will involve different&#13;
stakeholders, and operate at different levels, for different aspects:&#13;
-      Planning and Selection of Infrastructure Schemes&#13;
-      Detailed Design of Infrastructure Schemes&#13;
-      Implementation of Infrastructure Works&#13;
-      Monitoring of Infrastructure Works&#13;
-      Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure&#13;
-      Financing of Infrastructure Improvement and Maintenance.&#13;
*      Many aspects of LGED's activities already involve participation, and it has embarked upon a&#13;
number of initiatives to develop more participatory approaches:&#13;
-      it is a rural infrastructure development agency with a genuine poverty focus in its&#13;
work, has a significant presence throughout the country at local-level (Thana and&#13;
District) and inter-acts with different stakeholders at local-level.&#13;
the concept of LGED  staff as 'social engineers' is emerging, training in socio-&#13;
economic issues is being developed, and LGED is taking steps to strengthen its 'social'&#13;
staffing capacity - most importantly by the conversion of selected staff in each Thana&#13;
office to the post of 'community organiser', and the provision of training to these&#13;
community organisers.&#13;
LGED is already involved in developing planning capacity at union and thana level,&#13;
e.g. through extensive training, the use of the Union and Thana Plan Books, and is&#13;
refining procedures to increase the level of participation. LGED's existing training&#13;
programs needs to be reviewed and tailored according to the needs of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 3 of II&#13;
LGED already works with UPs and TDCCs in the implementation of different&#13;
programs, e.g. the Growth Centre Connecting Roads (GCCR) program, and the&#13;
Integrated Food for Development (IFFD) project which LGED implements with&#13;
CARE.&#13;
LGED pioneered the concept of Labour Contracting Societies in Bangladesh to exploit&#13;
the opportunities of infrastructure works to provide employment for the rural poor men&#13;
and women (see attachment 1)&#13;
LGED is now expanding this concept to employ disadvantaged, assetless women for&#13;
routine maintenance, tree caretaking on FRBs, and other infrastructure building&#13;
activities.&#13;
As part of the development of the FRB maintenance system, LGED is involving the&#13;
UPs in monitoring of maintenance works.&#13;
LGED is now addressing the needs of women at improved markets.&#13;
*     LGED's participatory approach has been further developed in the preparation of the RRMIMP-&#13;
2 project - a participatory approach has been adopted for the pre-selection of FRBs, Growth&#13;
Centre markets and ghats for improvement under the project, involving group discussions at&#13;
Thana level with representatives including women members of each Union (together with the&#13;
Thana Engineer and the TNO) to identify and rank local priorities for improvement.&#13;
*     Activities under the project should aim to build upon, reinforce and extend existing LGED&#13;
initiatives in participation. However there are some institutional issues that extend beyond&#13;
LGED and relate to the Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local Government,&#13;
Rural Development and Co-operatives (MLGRD&amp;C).&#13;
3.    Community Participation in Infrastructure Development&#13;
*     The project area covers 14 Districts, 97 Thanas, 960 Unions and about 22 million people.&#13;
Initiatives under the project in respect of community participation must be both practical and&#13;
manageable within the scale of the project.&#13;
*     Field investigations have been carried out to assess the scope and identify the mechanisms for&#13;
community participation in selection of schemes (SRR), in detailed design (markets and ghats),&#13;
and in monitoring (SRR, markets and ghats). Specific attention was given to the participation&#13;
of women in these aspects.&#13;
*     The key findings from the field investigations are as follows:&#13;
Rural people including target and interest groups (the end-users) would like to become&#13;
more involved in the selection and design of rural infrastructure schemes - SRR,&#13;
Markets, Ghats. They have something valuable to offer in terms of their local&#13;
knowledge of needs and  priorities, and  in  recommending  detailed  design&#13;
improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
117&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
Simple mapping exercises by road users (men &amp; women) provide a good basis for&#13;
community discussion on priorities for SRRs, and for presenting proposals to officials.&#13;
Group discussions and ranking exercises provide a mechanism for users' requirements&#13;
and priorities to be incorporated into the design of market and ghat improvements.&#13;
End-users are ill-informed about proposed development initiatives, about decision-&#13;
mraking processes and about procedures for operation and management of rural&#13;
infrastructure (e.g. markets). End-users are also ill-informed about sources and&#13;
allocation of funds. More information will result in greater transparency and will allow&#13;
'monitoring from below'.&#13;
Women are increasingly using roads and markets, and should be involved in&#13;
community participation processes. Market improvement schemes offer an opportunity&#13;
to stimulate increased use by women. Women groups, and NGOs that promote&#13;
income-generating activities for women, should be involved in determiining the need&#13;
for, and the design of, any special market facilities for women and in monitoring of its&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Market and ghat users indicate that they would be prepared to pay increased tolls for&#13;
improved facilities as long as they are consulted about the improvements.&#13;
Community discussions indicate that people have some reservations about the role of&#13;
NGOs in participatory planning, particularly in acting on their behalf as 'advocates' to&#13;
higher authorities. NGOs may also be reluctant to take on this role.&#13;
However there are possibilities for NGOs to support LGED in developing participatory&#13;
planning capability. A participatory process demands people to develop their capacity&#13;
to question about the issues that relate to them. So, NGOs who have the objectives of&#13;
social mobilisation to ascertain people's rights need to be selected.&#13;
*     The findings from the field investigations indicate that initiatives under the project in respect of&#13;
community participation should focus on:&#13;
i)    providing more information to rural men and women on infrastructure development&#13;
and management in their locality;&#13;
ii)   involvement of communities (men and women) in selection of SRR;&#13;
iii)   involvement of men and women users in the design of market and ghat improvements;&#13;
iv)   involvement of men and women groups in result based monitoring. To enable them to&#13;
do the monitoring using selected indicators will require field testing and training since&#13;
they will need to understand and to be familiarised with the indicators in order to play&#13;
an effective role.&#13;
*     Based on these conclusions, the project will incorporate two approaches to community&#13;
participation:&#13;
1 .    Throughout the project area 'Information Sharing' and feed back mechanisms will be&#13;
incorporated into the project. The aim is to inform rural people about:&#13;
broad plans in place for the area under the project, how these have been made,&#13;
and the financial implications including contributions that will be made by local&#13;
bodies.&#13;
aspects of the project where people can make an input to selection and design&#13;
(SRR, markets, ghats), and the channels for making their inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-      decisions that are made about, reasons for such decisions, and arrangements for&#13;
implementation of, investment schemes in their locality.&#13;
-      procedures for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure, sources and&#13;
allocation of funds, and responsibilities of local bodies (particularly in respect&#13;
of Rural Roads, markets and ghats).&#13;
The UPs will be an important partner in the process of information sharing. They will&#13;
require training and support from the LGED Community Organisers (who will also&#13;
require training in information dissemination techniques) and/or from other non&#13;
government organisations. A range of appropriate methods will be used for&#13;
dissemination of different types of information including:&#13;
-      'banging' of drums - a traditional method for spreading news. This should also&#13;
be done in the residential areas so that women get the information.&#13;
-      distribution of flyers.&#13;
-      public meetings.&#13;
-      posting of notices in prominent places, e.g. presentation of plans for market&#13;
improvement, and listing of members of the market management committee, in&#13;
Growth Centre markets.&#13;
-      advertising (of the SRR schemes).&#13;
-      use of local institution such as schools, madrasha, NGOs and social leaders.&#13;
This information sharing approach will include feed back from the beneficiaries and&#13;
sharing of information on problems faced, lessons learnt, strengths and weaknesses of&#13;
the implemented activities, special provisions for women in different activities, and&#13;
facilitate 'monitoring from below'. The project will monitor the performance and&#13;
effectiveness of the information sharing approach and methodologies.&#13;
2.    In a more targeted manner, community participation will be taken a stage further by&#13;
adopting a 'Users Input' approach:&#13;
i)    for the detailed design of Markets and Ghats, the approach will be applied&#13;
extensively to the proposed improvement schemes, but with representative&#13;
samples of users. Group discussions and ranking exercises will be used to&#13;
define local priorities for specific improvements and to provide inputs on&#13;
detailed aspects of design. This Users Input approach will be integrated into&#13;
the standard LGED procedure for physical planning and design of market&#13;
improvements. Draft plans and designs for improvement will be posted in each&#13;
market/ghat for review prior to finalisation.&#13;
ii)    for the SRR component, an extensive application of this approach will be made&#13;
in selected 'pilot' Districts, and in sample communities in those Districts,&#13;
identification of priorities for SRRs through mapping exercises will be&#13;
facilitated; the communities (men and women) encouraged and assisted to&#13;
represent their priorities to local officials; and participation in monitoring will&#13;
be included. Because of the national activities of this component (i.e. also&#13;
outside the project area of all the other components) the extensive approach&#13;
cannot be applied everywhere, yet for all the projects some level of&#13;
participation of beneficiaries, at least consultation by UP will be done.&#13;

Annex 2.3&#13;

The implementation of this approach will require capacity for facilitation of community&#13;
participation. The main mechanism for this will be to develop the capability of the&#13;
LGED Community Organisers, and the project will provide them with training and&#13;
monitor their performance. However the project may also experiment in specific areas&#13;
with other mechanisms including the temporary employment of university graduates&#13;
living in the rural&#13;
area; use of an NGO (though there are significant risks involved and the NGO must&#13;
have capability in PRA); the recruitment of a TA team to carry out the facilitation; and&#13;
the involvement of local individual experts in PRA. could be involved.&#13;
Special attention will be paid to ensuring that the approach incorporated inputs by&#13;
women as users' of infrastructure, and to involving women in the design of market&#13;
facilities to encourage women to use the markets for income-generating activities and&#13;
monitoring of their implementation. .&#13;
The users input approach will also be applied to the pilot program to improve NMT&#13;
(see Annex 2.4).&#13;
The project will be responsible for ensuring quality control of the users input approach&#13;
and for monitoring its effectiveness..&#13;
4.    Participatory Processes in the Different Components of the Project&#13;
Participation is build in into the different components of the project. The main features of each&#13;
component are summarised below.&#13;
4.1.   Feeder Roads Type B (FRB) Component&#13;
The FRB roads to be improved under this component have been selected using a participatory&#13;
approach involving consultation with local bodies - Union Parishads, TDCCs and NGOs - to derive a&#13;
short-list of roads based on local priorities, which were then subjected to economic appraisal.&#13;
4.2.   Maintenance component: Road User Committees&#13;
There is a need for involving road users in setting priorities for the development and&#13;
maintenance of the network. As roads are improved bus and truck operations become more important&#13;
and the opinions of bus and truck operators do matter, this is also true for the business community in&#13;
general. Since the road network provides also access to social services, the opinions of officials and&#13;
users of health and educational infrastructure are also important. Therefore the project emphasizes the&#13;
creation of Road User Committees. These committees will approve maintenance schemes and may be&#13;
involved with the approval of future investment schemes, these committees will include all above&#13;
mentioned stakeholders. After examining different options LGED proposes to create these Road User&#13;
Conmnittees at Thana level.&#13;

Annex 2.3&#13;

4.3.   Structures on Rural Roads (SRR) Component&#13;
It is in the SRR component that community participation plays a most important role. Under&#13;
the project a fund will be created to provide matching grants and the project will provide technical&#13;
services, but the decision to build a structure, where and when to build it and the local financial&#13;
contribution will be decided by the local people in collaboration with their elected local&#13;
representatives. The LGED Community Organisers will assist in this process using the "information&#13;
sharing" approach and in selected UPs using the "users input" approach.&#13;
The procedures of this component have been detailed during meetings with UP Chairmen and&#13;
the UP Chairmen association.&#13;
This component will include a national information campaign in order to create a demand from&#13;
the bottom up. Another important aspect is increasing UP resources by the transfer of central&#13;
government income to local government, matching grants will further increase resources and encourage&#13;
improved local revenue collection. Involving local NGOs, youth clubs and women's organisations will&#13;
increase local community participation and execution of part of the works by Labour Contracting&#13;
Societies (LCSs) will provide income to local poor men and women.&#13;
4.4.   Markets and Ghats Components&#13;
The design of markets and ghats will be based on participatory processes in order to take into&#13;
account users needs.&#13;
But the project will also formulates recommendations and implement changes in the&#13;
management of the markets and ghats. These changes aim at increasing participation by the users.&#13;
Proposed changes will aim at increasing the number of users as members of the existing but hardly&#13;
functioning Market Management Committees (MMC), and to provide further measures to improve the&#13;
functioning of these MMCs such as providing salaries to MMC members and the creation of an&#13;
assembly of all market users to supervise its activities periodically. Training and assistance will be&#13;
provided through the Community Organisers.&#13;
Market vendors will play a key role in managing the improved facilities through the users&#13;
committees; it is expected that procedures evolved in consultation with market users will set up&#13;
"assembly of market-users" for each market, to which the market committees will report every six&#13;
months. Similar procedures will be used for ghat management country boat owners/operators will play&#13;
key role in ghat management. There will also be more women-user members in these communities.&#13;
4.5.   Non Motorised Transport (NMT) Component&#13;
The Non Motorised Transport component aims at improving transport by rickshaws and&#13;
bullock carts. In order to work closely with the operators of these means of transport and to ensure&#13;
their interest and collaboration these activities will be executed by experienced local NGOs and other&#13;
stakeholders with only minimal supervisory involvement from LGED. Dissemination will be done in&#13;
close collaboration with the Bangladesh National Forum Group of the International Forum for Rural&#13;
Transport and Development, local NGOs and other community groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
121&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 8 of l1&#13;
4.6.   Human Resource Development (HIRD) Component&#13;
The HRD component will include the training required to improve the participatory aspects of&#13;
the project. First of all this component will include training of the Community Organisers (see also&#13;
above) but also of other LGED staff such as the Thana Engineers in order to make them aware of the&#13;
need for community participation, to guarantee their understanding of the approach and their full co-&#13;
operation, and finally give them the ability to manage a participatory process.&#13;
In the training of UP members and staff, understanding and implementing community&#13;
participation will be an important part of their training.&#13;
The trained LGED staff and specially the Community organisers will enable the beneficiaries&#13;
(including women) to assume and develop their capacity as stakeholders.&#13;
LGED training program under the project will give special emphasis to training of the women&#13;
members of UPs.&#13;
4.7.   Technical Assistance (TA) Component&#13;
In order to guarantee a successful implementation of the participatory approach the project will fund a&#13;
number of specialist positions to assist with the implementation of the approach. In order to provide&#13;
field training and supervise the LGED Community Organisers based in each Thana, the project will&#13;
provide a full-time Sociologist in each of the 14 districts covered by the project. These sociologists&#13;
will be assisted by two Senior Sociologists at the project headquarters. The project will also fund a&#13;
permanent position of a Sociologist (Participation and Land Acquisition) at the LGED headquarters in&#13;
the Planning Cell under the second Additional Chief Engineer. Finally the international DSM&#13;
consultants will provide 24 person-months of a Participation Specialist to advise on the development of&#13;
the methodologies and the implementation of the participatory approach, to develop the related training&#13;
programs, to advise on the monitoring of the effectiveness of the participation, and to define training&#13;
and human resource development needs to develop participatory capability in LGED.&#13;
5.    Institutional Issues&#13;
*     In addition to activities in the field, the project will contribute to the development of&#13;
participatory capability in LGED through:&#13;
-     organisation and conduct of seminars for senior staff, drawing on experience from the&#13;
project, from other agencies in Bangladesh and from other countries;&#13;
-     further development of the training course on socio-economic issues to incorporate&#13;
community participation, gender and development, case studies and practical sessions;&#13;
incorporation into the course of practical experience from the project, and extension of&#13;
training to all XENs and TEs, and to other engineering staff;&#13;
-     applying the experience from the project, particularly in respect of the 'Information&#13;
Sharing' and 'Users Input' approaches, to the refinement of the Union/Thana Plan&#13;
Book planning processes.&#13;
-     ensuring effective performance in participatory process by the engineers. Their&#13;
accountability would be linked to performance of the participatory aspects and their&#13;
performance evaluation would be done on the basis of these.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122                               Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
LGED should develop a policy and standard procedures for the use of labour groups for&#13;
different types of infrastructure works.&#13;
*     It is desirable that Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and other&#13;
tertiary engineering education institutions should incorporate social issues into their&#13;
undergraduate curricula. To get Engineers with knowledge on social aspects, LGED should&#13;
raise to the Ministry of Education through the Local Government Division a proposal in this&#13;
respect.&#13;
*     There are certain broader institutional issues related to the role of local government bodies in&#13;
rural infrastructure development that are within the responsibility of LGD rather than LGED.&#13;
These include:&#13;
-     policy action on revising the procedure for market lease bidding and on revising the&#13;
distribution of lease revenue;&#13;
-     development of the role of NILG in supporting the strengthening of local government&#13;
bodies;&#13;
-     measures to improve the effectiveness of the TDCC;&#13;
-     changing the composition of the MMC to make it more effective and more responsive&#13;
to the needs of market users.&#13;
6.    Gender Issues&#13;
The project help enhance women's participation by employment of women for small works;&#13;
better facilities in markets created in consultation with women-users; an employment of more&#13;
women engineers; encouraging more women-user members in market committees; and training&#13;
of the women members of UPs in project participation processes.&#13;
7.    Role of NGOs&#13;
The project includes many innovative features and will promote beneficiary participation in&#13;
many different ways, including the use of NGOs, because NGOs are in a better position to&#13;
organise the participation of poor beneficiaries in the area of rural development. There are&#13;
many areas in which NGOs would be contracted to help implement project components: in&#13;
implementing the non-motorised transport (NMT) pilot component; in assisting training and&#13;
participation of country boat owners involved with the river jetties, and training of poor&#13;
workers in organising themselves into labour contracting societies for doing earthworks in two&#13;
project districts and in piloting greater community involvement in maintenance. In addition, in&#13;
the large nation-wide component of rural drainage structures (culverts) which will be&#13;
implemented with local community participation (in selection, funding and supervision), it is&#13;
expected that following national advertisement of this competitive component, many small,&#13;
local NGOs will come forward to assist in these areas. Informal NGOs of market vendors and&#13;
users would likewise be involved in helping the design, maintenance and management of rural&#13;
markets under the project.&#13;

Attachment 1&#13;
Income-Generation for the Poor&#13;
*     LGED pioneered the concept of LCS as a means of targeting employment on infrastructure&#13;
works at the rural poor men and women. The concept has now been taken up by a number of&#13;
LGED projects, and by other agencies, under several different names - as a general term,&#13;
'labour groups' may be used. There are substantial variations in the different systems used in&#13;
respect of:&#13;
'targeting': e.g. the LGED/CARE Road Maintenance Project employs only assetless&#13;
women while a Project Implementation Committee set up by a UP for a food for work&#13;
scheme may simply employ 'local labour';&#13;
tasks: labour groups are variously used for construction earthworks, pipe culvert&#13;
casting and installation, HBB works, tree planting and caretaking, and routine&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
contractual arrangements: LGED does not enlist LCS as contractors, whereas under the&#13;
Early Implementation Project (EIP) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board they&#13;
are enlisted as Class D contractors (i.e. the lowest level of contractor). However LCS&#13;
engaged in construction works normally receive some advance payment.&#13;
payment: LGED pays labour groups engaged in maintenance regularly but in arrears.&#13;
The groups under the EIP receive staged payments including an advance. Labour&#13;
groups engaged in culvert making and installation normally receive an advance for&#13;
materials.&#13;
*     The labour group concept has the advantage that it targets employment directly at the rural&#13;
poor and eliminates middle-men, and offers the potential for assisting beneficiaries&#13;
subsequently to move on to other income-generating activities. However the formation and&#13;
social/economic development of such groups is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Further,&#13;
LCS engaged in earthworks construction normally only have a life span of only one&#13;
construction season (since there is no continuity of construction earthworks in the locality&#13;
where members of the group live).&#13;
*     There is considerable scope for the project to provide employment opportunities for the rural&#13;
poor through its infrastructure works. The scope for use of contracting groups has been&#13;
assessed as follows:&#13;
i)    embankment earthworks on FRBs must be mechanically compacted, and it is difficult&#13;
to combine use of labour groups for the earthworks with contractors for compaction.&#13;
Further, such labour groups would only have a life of one construction season. Labour&#13;
groups will not be used for FRB embankment construction. However they will be used&#13;
for ancillary earthworks on the SRR component, in conjunction with the introduction&#13;
of simple compaction equipment. But LGED will not expend significant effort on the&#13;
formation and development of labour groups for this activity wherever labour groups&#13;
are available through NGOs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
124                                Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 11 of 11&#13;
ii)    labour for pipe culvert casting and installation offer greater prospects for sustainability&#13;
and longer-term income-generation. The project will utilise such groups for some pipe&#13;
culvert works under the SRR component. The groups will require training and skill&#13;
development, and substantial advance payment to procure materials (or supply of the&#13;
materials by LGED);&#13;
iii)   labour groups have great potential for routine maintenance of FRB roads (shoulders,&#13;
embankments, cleaning of structures) combined with tree planting and caretaking.&#13;
Under the project this work will be targeted at disadvantaged, assetless women,&#13;
building on the procedures already being developed in LGED. The long-term&#13;
continuity of this work allows the project to assist group members to be self reliant -&#13;
through forced savings and/or credit provided by NGOs - to other income-generating&#13;
activities.&#13;
*     Labour groups must be trained in the technical aspects of their work and in work management,&#13;
supervision and payment procedures - the training in technical aspects is particularly important&#13;
for PCCI and routine maintenance groups, and responsibility for such training, and for&#13;
supervision of the works, will lie with LGED and the project.&#13;
*     The social aspects of group formation, mobilisation, gender and development, and 'self&#13;
reliance' represent very time-consuming tasks which LGED is not well placed to undertake. It&#13;
is preferable for LGED to:&#13;
-     work with other organisations (Bangladesh Rural Development Board and NGOs) who&#13;
are already involved in group formation and in the provision of credit. Thus, for&#13;
ancillary earthworks, groups which have already been formed by other organisations&#13;
can be used. Yet depending on the socio-economic situation of the area, willingness to&#13;
work on infrastructure, availability of labour group through NGOs will vary. Option&#13;
will be kept open for the project to form its own labour groups, if necessary.&#13;
-     develop longer-term relationships with 'affiliate' NGOs to focus on group development&#13;
but it is not advisable to groom new NGOs..&#13;
However LGED will take the lead in defining the targets (e.g. assetless women) for particular&#13;
types of labour group.&#13;

SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMIENT&#13;
AND MAINTANCE PROJECT&#13;
PILOT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE NON-MOTORISED TRANSPORT (NMT)&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
Non-motorised transport (NMT) plays a very important role in the rural transport system in&#13;
Bangladesh, and foremost among the different types of NMT are the cycle rickshaws.&#13;
There are estimated to be at least 300,000 cycle rickshaws in rural areas, comprising passenger&#13;
rickshaws (which mainly carry people but also move goods) and rickshaw vans (which mainly move&#13;
goods but also carry people). Cycle rickshaws provide affordable, flexible, demand-responsive and&#13;
extensive transport services in rural areas. They complement motor vehicle services on improved roads&#13;
and provide the main means of transport for rural people and their goods on lower levels of the&#13;
network where, because of poor road conditions, motor vehicles operate only with difficulty or not at&#13;
all. Cycle rickshaws give rural people in Bangladesh who cannot afford to own any means of transport&#13;
of their own a level of mobility which is not possible in other rural societies that do not have such&#13;
vehicles. A recent study on the impact of non-motorized transport on rural household's activity&#13;
patterns showed that of 100 sample households none had any motorized vehicle, only 12 percent had a&#13;
bicycle and 4 percent owned boats. The study further revealed that less than 1 percent of the activities&#13;
to which the household had to have access could be accessed solely using motorized vehicles; the rest&#13;
had to be done using either NMT (13 percent) or walking (41 percent) or any combinations of,&#13;
predominantly non-motorized modes (31 percent). Accordingly, there exists an enormous potential&#13;
demand for NMT to assist in meeting household's basic socio-economic transport needs. The potential&#13;
for motor vehicles to meet rural household's day to day transport demand is negligible because they are&#13;
not affordable: 31 percent of the households ruled out use of any type of vehicle, even in the case of&#13;
emergency, simply because they are beyond their financial means. Of the 69 percent who can afford&#13;
vehicle use, only 20 percent can afford motorized vehicles, while the remaining 80 percent can afford&#13;
only NMT. It was found that the time saved by the introduction of NMT would be used mainly for&#13;
productive purposes (44 percent and 23 percent for resp. work and domestic tasks). NMT are well-&#13;
suited to many of the mobility demands of rural people - travel over relatively short distances and&#13;
movement of relatively small volumes of goods. The RRMIMP-2 project traffic counts carried out on&#13;
98 unimproved FRB roads in the project area give an indication of the level of use of cycle rickshaws -&#13;
there is an average of 360 cycle rickshaw vehicle trips per day on each of these roads. It is estimated&#13;
that at least 400,000 people in rural areas are employed in the production, operation and repair of cycle&#13;
rickshaws. Most of the rural cycle rickshaws are owned by the men who pull them, and rickshaw&#13;
operation is a very important source of employment for the rural poor. A recent survey by the&#13;
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics found that rickshaw's share is 30 percent of the transport sector's total&#13;
contribution to the GDP.&#13;
There has tended in the past to be an assumption that it was not necessary to pay attention to&#13;
NMT, except as a hindrance to motor traffic, as they would rapidly disappear with the improvement of&#13;
the condition of the road network and economic development. There is some evidence of decline in the&#13;
ownership of bullock carts and in their use on improved rural roads. However the numbers of cycle&#13;
rickshaws and bicycles in rural areas is continuing to increase, especially on improved roads: recent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
126                                   Annex 2.4&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
studies show an increase of non-motorized vehicles on the improved road network of about 40 percent&#13;
one year after improvement to about 60 percent three years after improvement. NMT will continue to&#13;
play an important role in the rural transport system, and remain an important means of income-&#13;
generation for the rural poor, for the foreseeable future.&#13;
Although these figures indicate the large potential of NMT in meeting the transport needs of&#13;
the rural poor, there is the potential danger that the positive impact will be biased towards males and&#13;
the wealthier classes. Women's activity patterns show a low involvement in direct income generating&#13;
activities (on average 6.3 hrs per day is spent on domestic tasks, only 1.1 hr on income generating&#13;
activity). Cultural factors play a central role here and the proposed NMT project will include careful&#13;
investigation of the social, cultural, and economic factors related to the use of NMT.&#13;
The bicycle is the first means of independent, wheeled transport that a rural Bangladeshi can&#13;
afford to own. The ownership and use of bicycles can therefore be expected to continue to increase as&#13;
rural incomes increase. In rural areas bicycles have the advantages that they can be used to carry&#13;
significant amounts of goods as well as the rider, and they can be used on earthen tracks and narrow&#13;
footpaths (where larger vehicles cannot move) as well as on the road network.&#13;
2.     Design, Manufacturing and Financing Issues&#13;
The design of cycle rickshaws - passenger rickshaws and rickshaw vans - is based on bicycle&#13;
technology. They use a standard bicycle frame with the rear wheel removed, bicycle front forks, and&#13;
the bicycle front brake (rear brakes are not fitted). The extended rear frame, the rear axle, and the&#13;
passenger or goods-carrying body of the cycle rickshaws are fabricated in local workshops and bolted&#13;
on to the bicycle frame. There have been some innovations in design - stronger wheels on rickshaw&#13;
vans and minor variations in body designs - but to a very large extent the cycle rickshaws have&#13;
remained unchanged for many years, except for some regional adaptations.  The result of the&#13;
unchanged technology is that cycles rickshaws are widely available throughout the country and can be&#13;
produced, maintained and repaired anywhere. On the other hand the present designs are technically&#13;
deficient in many ways - they require great effort in pedalling, they have limited load space, and have&#13;
insufficient braking capacity. They are also subject to frequent breakdown - broken wheels, punctured&#13;
tyres, damaged frames and front forks - and require a lot of maintenance and repair.&#13;
Bullock carts are a traditional technology in Bangladesh, and are produced by highly skilled&#13;
carpenters in roadside workshops. The traditional, large wooden cart wheels, sometimes with iron&#13;
plated rims, are inefficient, and are a source of damaged to improved roads - in 1993 the Local&#13;
Government Division issued a circular that requires bullock carts used on paved roads to be fitted with&#13;
rubber-tyred wheels.&#13;
There could be potential to increase the load carrying-capacity and utility of bicycles in&#13;
Bangladesh through the introduction of bicycle trailers, particularly since the same basic design could&#13;
also be used as a hand-cart - a similar initiative is having growing success in Sri Lanka. Small scale&#13;
introduction and testing of such transport innovations that are successful in other countries is included&#13;
in the pilot program, with special attention for the transport needs of women, including addressing&#13;
current design constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
127                                Annex 2.4&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
There have been several previous initiatives to improve the design of NMT in Bangladesh, and&#13;
in particular to improve the design of cycle rickshaws. These initiatives have had no significant impact&#13;
on the many cycle rickshaws in use in rural areas, for several reasons:&#13;
*     The emphasis was purely on technical improvement to make the cycle rickshaws more&#13;
efficient, based on 'outsiders' perceptions of what was required, rather than basing innovations&#13;
on the needs and priorities of the rickshaw pullers, makers and users and setting the technical&#13;
developments in the context of the social and economic conditions within which cycle&#13;
rickshaws function.&#13;
*     The emphasis was on producing completely new designs of cycle rickshaws which were&#13;
different from the traditional technology, and which proved to be more expensive. The&#13;
successful adoption of these improved designs therefore required the rickshaw owners to invest&#13;
in a completely new, costly and, in their eyes unproven, technology. This they were reluctant&#13;
to do. Also, the new designs tended not to be suited to manufacture in the existing workshops.&#13;
*     To overcome the problems of cost, there was a tendency to try and introduce the new designs&#13;
through co-operatives. However co-operatives are rare among rural rickshaw pullers who&#13;
operate as individual owner-riders, although they do often form into local associations to&#13;
protect their common interests. No attempts were made to co-ordinate technical innovation&#13;
with the provision of credit for purchase of the new cycle rickshaws.&#13;
Market prices of new passenger rickshaws vary from Tk 8,000 to Tk 9,000, while prices of&#13;
rickshaw vans are slightly lower at Tk 6,000-7,000. Prices of used vehicles vary from Tk 3,000 to Tk&#13;
3,800. Monthly net income of rickshaw pullers varies from Tk 1,500 to Tk 1,700, with similar income&#13;
levels for rickshaw van pullers. Both categories reported that the monthly income reported is the only&#13;
source of income. Depending on the family size, their monthly expenditures vary from Tk 1,000 to Tk&#13;
1,500, making it very hard to put aside savings.&#13;
Commercial banks do not finance the purchase of NMT, regarding it as too risky. A number of&#13;
NGOs who operate as rural credit financing agencies offer loans to the rural poor which can, inter-alia,&#13;
be used to buy cycle rickshaws. However, in most cases the loans are not tailored specifically to&#13;
rickshaw purchase - thus, for example, the maximum credit limit may be too low for a poor person to&#13;
buy a new cycle rickshaw.&#13;
&#13;

3.    Objective, Benefits and Strategy for the Pilot Program to Improve NMT&#13;
The objective of the pilot program is to improve the performance and safety, increase the&#13;
reliability, improve the efficiency and load-carrying capacity, and increase the passenger comfort of&#13;
NMT.&#13;
The benefits will be reduced operating costs and improved levels of transport services at lower&#13;
fares, thus increasing the contribution of NMT to an efficient rural transport and trading system, and&#13;
sustaining and increasing the opportunities for the rural poor to generate income from production,&#13;
operation and repair of NMT. Furthermore, in combination with upgrading rural roads to all year&#13;
accessibility (not necessarily for motorized vehicles, but at least for NMT) under the project, mobility&#13;
and accessibility of the rural poor to centers of economic activity, health and education will be&#13;
improved substantially.&#13;
The strategy for the pilot program to improve NMT is determined primarily by learning from&#13;
past failures, and adopting an approach that will maximise the chances of success. The key features of&#13;
the strategy are as follows:&#13;
The program will focus first on improvements in cycle rickshaw design, second on design&#13;
improvements for bullock carts (with emphasis on alternatives for narrow-rimmed, damaging&#13;
wheels). Thirdly, the program will also examine the problems faced by women in using NMT&#13;
for their transport tasks and will introduce adapted designs (e.g. women bicycles) to cater for&#13;
women's transport needs. On a small scale, the program will demonstrate successful&#13;
technologies, developed abroad, such as bicycle trailers and wheelbarrows. The program will&#13;
learn by experience, and have the flexibility to adjust priorities based on that experience.&#13;
*     The program  will not attempt to introduce a 'better rickshaw'. Rather it will focus on&#13;
improvements to the design of specific aspects of the cycle rickshaw - eg. bodywork,&#13;
transmission, braking, front fork, wheels, etc. - which can be retro-fitted to existing rickshaws&#13;
as well as incorporated into newly-manufactured vehicles, and which can be produced in the&#13;
existing workshops. This will allow the many thousands of existing rickshaw pullers to benefit&#13;
from the improvements without making a large investment in a new vehicle.&#13;
*     The program will work from the start together with its target groups - rickshaw owners and&#13;
pullers, rickshaw makers, bullock cart owners and makers, and women. It will be guided by&#13;
their priorities for design improvements, and will work in partnership with them to develop,&#13;
test, modify and finalize the improved designs.&#13;
*     The program will emphasize the promotion and dissemination of the improved designs within&#13;
the project area and to other parts of the country, and the provision of credit to the rural poor&#13;
to purchase the improved designs. To this end it will from the start generate the interest of,&#13;
and involve, rural credit financing agencies and government, NGO and private sector actors&#13;
who can contribute to dissemination.&#13;
*     One successful technology to be demonstrated is a simple wheel-making technology, developed&#13;
and proven by the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG), which can be used&#13;

by existing small workshops to make strong, light, low-cost wheels for rickshaws, for rubber-&#13;
tyred bullock carts, for bicycle trailers and for other NMT.&#13;
4.    Implementation of Pilot Program&#13;
The pilot program will be in two Phases - Development and Dissemination - each of two years&#13;
duration. LGED will sub-contract the implementation of the program to an NGO, with the first phase&#13;
beginning in January 1997. The contracted NGO will combine the capability to work in a participatory&#13;
manner with grassroot NGOs and target groups in rural areas with the technical capacity needed to&#13;
develop the improved designs and the resources to organise and conduct training of local workshops in&#13;
the project area. Limited provision is made in Phase 1 for technical assistance to support the NGO in&#13;
technical and socio-economic aspects. LGED will select the NGO to execute the program, following&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency. To avoid delays in implementation of the component, LGED will invite shortlisted&#13;
NGOs no later than September 1, 1996, to submit their proposals and award the contract for Phase I&#13;
by March 10, 1996.&#13;

SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT&#13;
AND MAINTEANCE PROJECT (RRMIMP 2)&#13;
EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT&#13;
1.    Strategy&#13;
An inventory of the existing stock of equipment - construction, transport, laboratory and office&#13;
equipment - in each of the fourteen project Districts has been carried out.&#13;
The equipment procurement strategy for the project is:&#13;
a)    To provide the necessary vehicles, and office and training equipment, for efficient&#13;
operation of the Project Implementation Office (PIO).&#13;
b)    To ensure that each project District has:&#13;
-     sufficient reliable construction  equipment, in good  working  order so  that&#13;
implementation of civil works is not delayed by lack of equipment;&#13;
-     a well-equipped laboratory, and field testing equipment, so that quality control of civil&#13;
works can be maintained through laboratory and field testing of soils and materials;&#13;
-     sufficient vehicles - four-wheel drive, pick-up, motor cycles and bicycles - for effective&#13;
operation of the District and Thana offices, and to ensure the mobility of staff that is&#13;
necessary for effective supervision of works;&#13;
-     essential office and communications equipment for efficient project administration and&#13;
reporting;&#13;
-     essential training equipment.&#13;
c)    Initially to equip the PIO, and the five Districts in the Greater Dhaka Area which,&#13;
because they have not yet benefited from an RDP, have only very limited equipment.&#13;
Subsequently to procure additional equipment for the remaining nine project Districts to&#13;
replace existing equipment which will reach the end of its useful working life during the course&#13;
of project implementation.&#13;
d)    To introduce in each of the project Districts the items of low-cost, appropriate, locally-&#13;
made construction and maintenance equipment that the project will develop, for use on project&#13;
civil works and for demonstration to contractors.&#13;
&#13;

SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT&#13;
AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT (RRMIMP 2)&#13;
TRAINING COMPONENT UNDER THE PROJECT&#13;
1.    Objectives, Policy and Administrative Issues&#13;
Training is the essential method for acquiring knowledge, skills and for changing attitude in order to&#13;
cope with the quickly changing world. Development of competence of staff within LGED is&#13;
prerequisite in order to: assume the wider role played by LGED in rural infrastructure development -&#13;
not only related to hard-core engineering but also related to other aspects of development, like,&#13;
monitoring impact of infrastructure on socio-economic development, community participation in&#13;
infrastructure planning etc.; take up the challenging tasks of increased work-load; and cope with the&#13;
rapidly changing technology with regard to infrastructure planning, development and maintenance.&#13;
With donors' support LGED has taken a very ambitious program for the staff and some groups outside&#13;
LGED . On top of the program undertaken by LGED with regard to training of LGED staff, there is&#13;
still some opportunity to support LGED in its effort to develop trained manpower in order to cope with&#13;
the added responsibility warranted by this project and other projects. The following sections deal with&#13;
the current aspects of training in LGED; objectives, policy and administrative aspects of the training&#13;
program to be undertaken under this project.&#13;
2.    Training and LGED&#13;
The training activities at LGED started in the former Works Program Wing (WPW) in 1981 which&#13;
gained a real momentum in 1984 with the establishment of Local Government Engineering Bureau&#13;
(LGEB). At present all training programs in LGED are coordinated and implemented through the Head&#13;
Quarter Training Unit (HQTU) at Dhaka and fifteen other District Training Centers (DTC). The&#13;
Training Unit is headed by a Superintending Engineer (SE) who is assisted by an expatriate Training&#13;
Adviser and local training specialists and two Senior Training Specialists (STSs), three Training&#13;
Specialists (TSs), one Assistant Training Specialist (ATS) and fifteen District Training Officers&#13;
(DTOs). District Executive Engineers of LGED provide administrative support to the DTOs when&#13;
required.&#13;
The responsibilities of the LGED Training Units include:&#13;
* develop an overall policy for LGED training&#13;
* assess training needs for different categories of staff&#13;
* develop training materials for all courses&#13;
* arrange and conduct training courses at HQ and district levels in order to fulfill national training&#13;
requirements in the sector&#13;
* arrange and conduct on-the-job-training during preparation and implementation of schemes&#13;
* provide assistance for specific training programs of all projects under LGED&#13;

Training Unit provides training for Projects Directors (PDs), Executive Engineers (XENs), Thana&#13;
Engineers/Assistant Engineers and other staff at the Thana and District level. The training program is&#13;
based on the a need assessment made five years ago. Currently another need assessment exercise is&#13;
being conducted by the Training Unit. Future training program will be based on the needs assessed&#13;
from this exercise.&#13;
HQTU is responsible for the overall coordination of all training courses. The courses offered by the&#13;
HQTU are conducted by the concerned TS. DTOs conduct those courses which are conducted in the&#13;
district level. The HQTU and District offices of the Training Unit are organized and well equipped&#13;
with modern teaching aids and the staff are professionally competent.&#13;
* In addition to the implementation of the National Training Program, HQTU of LGED also&#13;
centrally coordinate the training courses planned under different projects implemented by LGED.&#13;
The TU also provides assistance to different projects in conducting project specific training&#13;
courses. The TU has also shown its flexibility in responding to the needs of LGED arise from time&#13;
to time due to the change of training needs - like training on environmental and socio-economic&#13;
aspects - and targeted trainee - like, contractors, laborers.&#13;
3.    Objectives of the Training Program Under the Project&#13;
3.1   Immediate Objectives:&#13;
* to increase capability of LGED staff to implement project components effectively;&#13;
* to increase capability of local government bodies (Union Parishads, Market and Ghat Management&#13;
Committees) with respect to local level infrastructure planning following users input approaches;&#13;
* to increase technical and management capability of local contractors.&#13;
3.2    Long-Term Objectives&#13;
* to increase sustainability and efficiency of rural infrastructure investments with optimum input&#13;
from all actors in the process.&#13;
4. Training Strategies&#13;
The training component of the project will have the following strategies:&#13;
*     the component will play a complementary role to the ongoing training activities of LGED;&#13;
* the courses offered under the training component will be chosen in such a way that it will have&#13;
sustainable impact;&#13;
* the project will finance on priority basis training related to the components either first introduced&#13;
with an option for institutionalization or other components with an options for institutionalization&#13;

Implementation office (Headquarters) and the District Training Engineers in this respect. The Project&#13;
Implementation Office will maintain close liaison with the Training Unit of LGED in relation to the&#13;
planning and implementation of the training courses of the project. Before the beginning of each&#13;
financial year, the Project Director with the help of the STC and the Training Unit will chalk out&#13;
detailed training program for training related component of this project for the following financial&#13;
year. The Project Director will ensure that the training programs undertaken under the project is&#13;
included in the Training Calendar of LGED with name of the specific courses and duration of such&#13;
courses. The courses which are envisaged to have direct implication on the planning and&#13;
implementation of the project will be undertaken as soon as the start of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

For the overseas training, project related personnel - both working in the field and at the PIO - will get&#13;
preference. Upon returning from the overseas training courses, the trained personnel - individually or&#13;
in a group - will present the salient features of the overseas training in a seminar organized by the&#13;
project. The trainee(s) (overseas) will also submit to the Chief Engineer, LGED a detailed report on&#13;
the overseas training courses elaborating on the courses undertaken, training methodology adopted for&#13;
conducting such courses and relevance of such training in relation to rural infrastructure development&#13;
in Bangladesh. Unless otherwise required due to extraordinary circumstances, the overseas trained&#13;
project personnel should not be transferred from the project area within one year of returning to&#13;
Bangladesh from the overseas courses to ensure their contribution to the project. The overseas trainees&#13;
will get daily allowances as per SDC rule as SDC is the major contributor of this component.&#13;
The Project Director with the help of STC will review at least on a half yearly basis about the progress&#13;
of implementation of training component with the Training Unit. Deliberations of such a meeting will&#13;
be recorded and copy of the meeting minute should be circulated to all concerned. The Project Director&#13;
with he help of STC will also review the modules prepared by the Training Unit for project specific&#13;
training and arrange revision of modules, wherever necessary.&#13;

OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR STUDIES&#13;
1.           TOR FOR SMALL-SCALE CONTRACTING INDUSTRY STUDY&#13;
Objectives of the Study&#13;
The objectives of the study are:&#13;
1 .    To develop a better understanding of the nature and characteristics of small-scale civil&#13;
engineering contractors who work, or wish to work, for LGED and of the technical, financial,&#13;
commercial and management constraints to their development.&#13;
2.    To advise on improvement of the existing measures that are being applied, and additional&#13;
measures that could be adopted, by LGED under the RRMIMP-2 to increase the capability of&#13;
contractors in the project area, particularly in respect of their technical and management skills,&#13;
their ability to bid for and implement higher value and more technically demanding contracts,&#13;
and their level of ownership of equipment.&#13;
3.    To identify broader measures that could be adopted by LGED, and by LGED in co-ordination&#13;
with other agencies such as the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) and in the context of&#13;
future donor-supported projects, to develop the small-scale civil engineering contracting&#13;
industry in Bangladesh and to promote the development of a thriving plant hire contracting&#13;
industry.&#13;
Scope of Works&#13;
1 .    Review of LGED and RRMIMP-2 pre-qualification, tendering and contracting documents and&#13;
procedures, and of their experience with small-scale contractors (through discussions with&#13;
LGED staff at HQ, project, District and Thana level) and of earlier initiatives to develop&#13;
contractor capability.&#13;
2.    Review of the activities in respect of contractor development, and of equipment management&#13;
by LGED, that are being carried out under RRMIMP-2.&#13;
3.    Review  of initiatives to develop standard contract documents for donor-financed small&#13;
infrastructure works in Bangladesh, and to establish common pre-qualification of contractors&#13;
by LGED and RHD.&#13;
4.    Preparation of an overview of the extent and characteristics of the small-scale contracting&#13;
industry, primarily through examination of LGED's records and procedures for pre-qualifying&#13;
contractors to work on RDP projects, and of their experience of these contractors. This,&#13;
together with analysis of other sources of information will provide the basis to develop an&#13;
assessment of the extent of the small-scale contracting industry, and a classification of different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

categories of small-scale contractors based on key indicators such as equipment owned, number&#13;
of skilled and qualified staff, and types of work that they are able to undertake.&#13;
5.     Based on this analysis, a detailed survey (which might include workshops with groups of&#13;
contractors) of a cross-section of different categories of small-scale contractors in the project&#13;
area. This cross-section will include contractors pre-qualified for and working on RRMIMP-2&#13;
contracts (some of these in the RDP-7 areas will have several years of experience of such&#13;
work, while others in the Greater Dhaka area will have only limited experience); and other&#13;
contractors who wish to work for LGED, including those who have failed to pre-qualify and&#13;
those who undertake smaller works for the RHD. The purposes of the survey are to:&#13;
i)     define the business structure and financial situation of the different categories of small-&#13;
scale contractors, and identify the financial constraints that they face in taking on&#13;
different types of contract with LGED and other agencies;&#13;
ii)    define the numbers and types of unskilled, skilled, and qualified staff that they employ,&#13;
and the basis of employment (e.g. casual, fixed-term or permanent);&#13;
iii)   assess the perceptions of small-scale contractors about the long-term security of their&#13;
businesses, the types and level of commercial risks involved, and the constraints that&#13;
they face in investing in longer-term business development (e.g. in employing technical&#13;
staff on a permanent basis);&#13;
iv)    examine the attitudes towards and constraints to investment in equipment, and attitudes&#13;
towards the development of plant hire companies;&#13;
v)     assess needs for developing the technical and management capability of the contractors.&#13;
6.     Discussions with other interested parties in Bangladesh - including other government agencies&#13;
(and in particular the RHD and the Institutional Development Component of its RRMP2&#13;
project), IDA and SDC and other donor agencies, the Dhaka office of the IFC, leasing&#13;
companies, equipment manufacturers and importers, banks who have small-scale contractors as&#13;
clients, and contractors' associations - to assess:&#13;
i)    issues relating to financing of small-scale contractors by commercial banks;&#13;
ii)    the feasibility of and mechanisms for co-ordinated actions to develop the small&#13;
contracting industry;&#13;
iii)   the feasibility of and mechanisms for, financing the purchase of construction&#13;
equipment, including supporting the development of plant hire companies, and the&#13;
possible role of the IFC;&#13;
iv)    the potential role of contractors' associations in assisting the development of the small-&#13;
scale contracting industry.&#13;
7.     Preparation of a report of findings and conclusions, together with specific recommendations&#13;
on:&#13;
i)    improvements to existing measures, and additional measures to be adopted, by LGED&#13;
under the RRMIMP-2 to increase the capability of contractors in the project area,&#13;
particularly in respect of their technical and management skills, their ability to bid for&#13;
and implement higher value and more technically demanding contracts, and their level&#13;
of ownership of equipment;&#13;

ii)    broader measures by LGED, and by LGED in co-ordination with other agencies and in&#13;
the context of future donor-supported projects, to develop the small-scale civil&#13;
engineering contracting industry in Bangladesh, and to encourage the development of a&#13;
plant hire contracting industry, with recommendations on institutional mechanisms and&#13;
implementation modalities to apply these measures.&#13;
A summary of findings will be prepared, and a one-day workshop will be conducted with&#13;
LGED, project, and financing agency staff, representatives of small-scale contractors and other&#13;
interested parties (as defined in Para. 6 of the scope of works) to review the findings prior to&#13;
the finalisation of the report.&#13;
Inputs&#13;
It is envisaged that the study will require:&#13;
*     A two-month input by an international specialist with extensive experience, including Asia&#13;
region experience, of the development of small-scale civil engineering contracting industries.&#13;
*     Inputs of two months each by two national consultants - a contracting specialist and an&#13;
enterprise development specialist, each with extensive relevant experience.&#13;
*     All necessary support services including transport, office services and communications.&#13;
LGED and the RRMIMP-2 project will ensure all necessary advisory support and access to relevant&#13;
information and personnel.&#13;
2.         TOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR UNIT COSTS STUDY&#13;
Objectives of the Study&#13;
The objectives of the study are to:&#13;
*     Develop a model which can be applied by the RRMIMP-2, and by the other RDPs in LGED,&#13;
for the compilation of standard unit cost rates for the major work items in the construction of&#13;
improved FRBs, culverts and bridges on FRBs and Rural Roads, and improved facilities at&#13;
Growth Centres, and in the periodic maintenance of FRB roads and structures. Also to define&#13;
the most reliable sources of the information to estimate actual costs incurred by contractors.&#13;
*     Apply this model to prepare standard RRMIMP-2 unit cost rates for the major items of&#13;
construction and maintenance works, and define the procedure for annual updating of the unit&#13;
cost rates.&#13;
Scope of Works&#13;
1.    Review of the existing RRMIMP-2 contract documents, Bills of Quantities, and estimates of&#13;
unit cost rates.&#13;
2.    Discussions with other RDPs and with the LGED Design Cell to review and analyse variations&#13;
in Bills of Quantities and estimates of unit costs rates within LGED.&#13;
3.    Review of the full economic rates for hire of LGED equipment to contractors developed in&#13;
each of the 14 project Districts under the RRMIMP-2.&#13;

Page 4 of 11&#13;
4.     Review, with a sample of RRMIMP contractors in different project Districts, of their&#13;
compilation of unit cost rates (rate analysis), and of their estimates of:&#13;
-      labour and equipment productivities;&#13;
-      labour and equipment cost rates;&#13;
-      material costs;&#13;
-      other direct cost components;&#13;
-      overheads and profits that they must incorporate into their unit cost rates;&#13;
-      lump sum costs.&#13;
5.    Cross-checking of the competitiveness and validity of the cost, productivity, overhead and&#13;
lump sum estimates used by contractors in their rate analyses. This will comprise:&#13;
-      field investigations in the same project Districts including discussions with materials&#13;
suppliers, LGED staff and other sources of cost data, and site analyses of productivity&#13;
rates and of labour costs;&#13;
-      identification and analysis of other sources of cost information, including available&#13;
statistical data and relevant reports produced by LGED projects.&#13;
6.    Preparation, review with RRMIMP and other project and LGED Design Cell staff, and&#13;
finalisation of recommended formats for calculating standard unit cost rates for all major&#13;
construction and periodic maintenance work items.&#13;

3.                TOR FOR FRB REGIONAL PRIORITISATION STUDY&#13;
Objectives of the Study&#13;
The objectives of the study are to:&#13;
*     Develop guidelines for prioritising the needs for investment in improvement of FRBs between&#13;
the 64 Districts in the country, which can be applied in making decisions on the geographic&#13;

allocation of financing agency resources for RDPs and GOB resources for FRB improvement.&#13;
*     Develop guidelines for selecting and prioritising specific FRB roads to be improved in a&#13;
particular area.&#13;
The findings of the study will be applied, inter-alia, as inputs to the identification and preparation of a&#13;
new RDP as a follow-up to the RRMIMP-2 project.&#13;
Approach, and Scope of Work&#13;
The purpose of the study is not to produce a prescriptive master plan for the development of the FRB&#13;
network in Bangladesh. Rather, it aims to:&#13;
i)    provide rational guidelines for selecting and prioritising the geographic areas for new RDP&#13;
projects, for defining the scope of FRB works in those areas, and for geographic targeting of&#13;
GOB FRB investments. This will be based on assessment of the present level of improved FRB&#13;
provision in relation to the road network needs and to the economic status and potential, and&#13;
the social situation, in the different Districts of the country;&#13;
ii)    develop standard guidelines, which can be applied across different FRB investment programs,&#13;
for selecting and prioritising specific FRB roads for improvement, taking account of the needs&#13;
for economic viability and for local participation in the selection of investment schemes to meet&#13;
local priorities.&#13;
The guidelines must also take account of the future availability of GOB revenue financing for routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance of the improved FRBs, in order to sustain the investments made.&#13;
The study will involve:&#13;
1.    Review with LGED of its existing FRB data-base (comprising a comprehensive road inventory&#13;
and maps), complemented by selective field surveys and collection of additional data from&#13;
LGED District Offices as necessary, to define the present extent, surfacing and condition of&#13;
the FRB network (including structures on FRBs) by District.&#13;
2.     Review of the criteria actually used by LGED to define this network; the costs of routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance of improved FRBs; and the present and likely future availability of GOB&#13;
revenue funds for such maintenance. Based on this, and to the extent necessary, refine the&#13;
criteria and define a smaller, 'core' maintainable FRB network and its distribution across the&#13;
Districts, and assess the cost of improving and upgrading this network to good, all-weather&#13;
bitumen surfaced standard.&#13;
3.     Definition of easily quantifiable indicators to compare the present level of provision of&#13;
improved, bitumen surfaced, good condition FRBs in the 64 Districts in relation to the present&#13;
economic status, future economic potential and social situation of those Districts. This will&#13;
draw upon, but refine and expand, the indicators used in the IDA/LGED rural infrastructure&#13;
strategy study.&#13;
4.     Using these indicators, and with selective additional field surveys as necessary, preparation of&#13;
an analysis of the present level of improved FRB provision by District.&#13;
5.     Based on the analysis of the maintainable FRB network and the present level of improved FRB&#13;
provision:&#13;
-      preparation of guidelines for selecting and prioritising Districts for FRB investments;&#13;

-     definition of procedures that can be applied by LGED to update the analysis of the&#13;
network and the level of FRB provision.&#13;
6.    Review  with LGED of the methodologies used by different LGED  rural infrastructure&#13;
programs to select FRB investment schemes; of the LGED socio-economic monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (SEM&amp;E) activities and findings; of efforts to harmonise SEM&amp;E in LGED; and of&#13;
methodologies used in LGED for local participation in selection of priorities for FRB&#13;
improvement.&#13;
7.    Based on this review, and complemented by selective field investigations, preparation of&#13;
guidelines for selecting and prioritising specific FRB roads to be improved in a particular area,&#13;
including local participation in the identifications.&#13;
8.    Review of all findings and recommendations with LGED and the IDA and the SDC prior to&#13;
finalising the report.&#13;
Inputs&#13;
It is envisaged that the study will require:&#13;
*     A ten week input by an international transport economist/planner with specialist experience,&#13;
including Asia region experience, in the planning and development of rural road networks.&#13;
*     Ten person-months of inputs by a team of experienced national consultants whose combined&#13;
expertise will cover transport economics, rural transport planning and rural road engineering.&#13;
*     All necessary support services including transport, office services and communications.&#13;
The consultants will work closely with the Rural Infrastructure Maintenance Cell, the Planning Unit&#13;
and the Management Information Systems Cell in LGED. LGED and the RRMIMP-2 project will&#13;
ensure all necessary advisory support and access to relevant information and personnel.&#13;
4.            TOR FOR LONG-TERM SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY&#13;
Objective of the RRMIMP-2 Impact Study&#13;
The objective of the RRMIMP-2 impact study is to evaluate the impact of FRB, Rural Road, market&#13;
and ghat investments, and the resulting increased efficiency in the transport and trading system, on&#13;
economic and social development within the influence area of the investments. The study will:&#13;
i)    analyse and quantify the effects of the FRB, Rural Road and ghat investments on transport;&#13;
ii)    analyse and quantify the effects of the market investments on marketing;&#13;
iii)   in respect of economic development, evaluate and quantify the impact of the different&#13;
categories of transport investments, and of market investments, on agricultural production and&#13;
productivity, business activity, direct and indirect employment, income-generation and poverty&#13;
alleviation, and consumption and investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
148&#13;
Annex 2.7&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
iv)    in respect of social development, focus on evaluating and quantifying the impact of the road&#13;
improvements on the efficiency and use of rural health (including family planning) and&#13;
education services.&#13;
The study will evaluate the impact of the investments on all sectors of the rural population in the area,&#13;
but will be designed in such a way that the impact on sub-sectors of the rural population which are of&#13;
special interest - the poor, destitute women, women engaged in income-generating activities, transport&#13;
operators including rickshaw pullers, vehicle owners and market traders - can be evaluated.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
The methodology will be based on, but refined and extended from, that used for the RDP-7 impact&#13;
study. In addition to the RDP-7 FRB roads for which some data has already collected, the study will&#13;
focus on RRMIMP-2 FRB roads and markets to be improved (including markets where the adjacent&#13;
ghat will also be improved), and Rural Roads where SRRs are to be constructed, in the 1996/97&#13;
Financial Year. Samples of these FRB and RR roads and markets (including ghats) will be selected for&#13;
detailed investigation, together with 'control' roads, markets and ghats which will not be improved&#13;
during the duration of the study. Benchmark Surveys will be carried out prior to the construction&#13;
works, and Follow-Up Surveys will be carried out at two stages after the works have been completed -&#13;
one year after completion to collect data for analysis of short-term effects and impacts; and three years&#13;
after completion to collect data for analysis of longer-term effects and impacts.&#13;
Based on the RDP-7 study the survey methodology will comprise:&#13;
i)    selection of survey villages within the influence area of, but at different distances from, each&#13;
sample road and market;&#13;
ii)    surveys in each village with a sample of households to collect household level data. The sample&#13;
will be stratified to cover different land-owning classes - landless and marginal (up to 0.4 ha.),&#13;
medium (0.4-1.0 ha.) and large (more than 1.0 ha.) - plus the population sub-groups which are&#13;
of special interest. The Benchmark and Follow-Up Surveys will use the same household&#13;
samples;&#13;
iii)   community, 'key informant' and any other surveys to collect other necessary data, e.g. in&#13;
relation to markets, schools, heath centres, business enterprises, price and wage levels, and the&#13;
effects of the road improvements on transport; and in relation to 'special interest' sub-samples&#13;
such as transport operators and market traders.&#13;
Scope of Work and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
The RRMIMP-2 impact study will be carried out under contract to LGED by the same consultants who&#13;
are already carrying out the RDP-7 impact study. These consultants have specialised expertise in the&#13;
conduct of rural impact studies, and this arrangement allows the data and findings from the RDP-7&#13;
study to be incorporated into the larger study.&#13;
The study will be managed by the LGED Additional Chief Engineer (Design, Planning, Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation) and the consultants will co-ordinate with the SEM&amp;E unit the RRMIMP-2 Project&#13;
Implementation Office. The services of LGED field staff will be used to the extent possible for data&#13;
collection but the consultants will be fully responsible for the efficient and effective conduct of the&#13;
study, including supervision of all data collection.&#13;
&#13;

149                                  Annex 2.7&#13;
Page 8 of 11&#13;
Prior to commencing work the consultants will prepare, for review and approval by LGED and the&#13;
IDA, a proposal for the conduct of the study which will:&#13;
i)    define the possible impacts to be evaluated, and the indicators which will be used to evaluate&#13;
those impacts;&#13;
ii)    summarise the types of data to be collected, the methods of data collection, and the analytical&#13;
procedures that will be adopted to derive findings on the impact of the infrastructure&#13;
investments;&#13;
iii)   define the arrangements for incorporation of the data-base and findings from the RDP-7 study&#13;
into the larger study;&#13;
iv)    define the sampling frame - numbers of FRB and RR roads and markets, numbers and location&#13;
of villages, sizes of stratified survey samples - to ensure that the findings on the impacts of the&#13;
investments on different sectors of the rural population are statistically significant. This&#13;
sampling frame will take account of the fact that there will be some decay of the original&#13;
sample - as a result of death, people moving away from the area, etc. - between successive&#13;
surveys;&#13;
v)    define the procedure for use of 'controls' to isolate the impacts of the investments from other&#13;
economic and social changes that take place in the study area over the duration of the study;&#13;
vi)    present a work plan for the conduct of the study;&#13;
vii)   define the resources and budget required for the conduct of the study.&#13;
The study will be carried out in three Phases:&#13;
Phase 1:      Benchmark Survey. July 1996 to March 1997&#13;

SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
MAINTENANCE OF RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
1.1   Introduction&#13;
This annex sumnmarizes the extent and objectives for maintenance of Feeder Roads B (FRB),&#13;
Rural Roads (RR), structures on FRBs and RRs and other infrastructures (markets, ghats) which are&#13;
maintainable condition in the project area of the RRMIMP-II or which will be improved under the&#13;
Project. It describes the responsibilities and organizational setup for the implementation of a sustained&#13;
maintenance program, the funding requirements and the measures to strengthen human and institutional&#13;
capacities. For the later it proposes possible links to the ongoing Institutional Development Component&#13;
(IDC) of the 2nd RRMP (RHD Project funded by ODA &amp; IDA). Regarding the implementation of&#13;
maintenance it relies on the "Guidelines for Implementation of Rural Infrastructure Maintenance&#13;
Program", LGED, July 1995.&#13;
1.2   The Challenge for Maintenance of Road Assets&#13;
The flat and low lying terrain as well as heavy rains and high flood levels in the country&#13;
require high embankments and numerous bridges and culverts to assure an all-weather transport&#13;
network linking growth center markets to the national roads and to ensure the access for the rural&#13;
population to those poles of development. Sufficient routine and periodic maintenance will&#13;
safeguard these expensive national assets over an extended number of years. Maintenance works&#13;
generate short and long term incomes to small contractors, landless farmers and destitute women.&#13;
The upkeep of infrastructure will have a positive impact on agricultural production and income&#13;
through reduction of transport costs. Generally speaking, sustained improvement of the life of&#13;
rural (and urban) population and thus poverty alleviation will not be possible without an adequate&#13;
access to economic, social and welfare services.&#13;
2.   Objectives of Routine and Periodic Maintenance Components of RRMIMP-II&#13;
The overall development objective of the proposed project is to increase rural incomes and&#13;
reduce rural poverty by establishing an improved, sustainable rural transport and trading infrastructure.&#13;
The routine and periodic maintenance of the infrastructures shall guarantee that they function over an&#13;
extended period of time and safeguard the investments made. In line with the objectives of the project&#13;
(see Annex 2.1) the strategy shall focus on i) planning, progranmming and implementation of routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance for FRBs and structures, and important RRs in maintainable condition, ii)&#13;
supporting the maintenance of SRRs, Markets and Ghats by local bodies at Thana and Union Parishad&#13;
(UP) level, iii) use of the private sector for the execution of works (contractors, LCSs) and iv) support&#13;
to human, institutional and technical capacity building at all institutional levels of the Project.&#13;
3.    Rural Road Network and other Rural Infrastructures&#13;
3.1   Inventory and Condition of Rural Road Network in Project Area&#13;
The total rural road network of the Project area (Greater Dhaka, Rajshahi, Pabna and&#13;
Bogra Districts) which is under the current responsibility of LGED, amounts in rounded&#13;
figures, to (details of total length of the rural road network in km and structures in lin.m are in&#13;
Table 1) are as follows:&#13;
3,200 km of Feeder Roads Type B (FRB), and&#13;
29,800 km of Rural Roads (9,450 km of RI, 10,150 km of R2 and 10,200 km of R3).&#13;

The LGED Road Inventory 1994/95 mentions 3,200 km FRB, out of which 800 km&#13;
(25%) are classified as in good, 1,900 km (59%) in average and 500 km (16%) in poor&#13;
condition. The recent increase in Growth Centers is not yet considered in these figures. Upon&#13;
completion of the 1995/96 program of RDP-6 and RDP-7, 1,100 km of the FRB network will&#13;
be surfaced, 700km with a bituminous surfacing, 400 km with a HBB or WBM surface. The&#13;
Project will increase the length of bituminous surfaced roads by 570 km, so that the final&#13;
length will be 1,270 km. About 1,000 km of RRs are surfaced, 300 km with bituminous&#13;
surfacing and 700 km with HBB or WBM. The details are shown in Table 2.&#13;

3.2   Inventory of Structures on Feeder Roads-B and Rural Roads (SRR)&#13;
Many of the rural roads were first built under food for work schemes, with no funds&#13;
for mechanical compaction or for provision of structures. The rural road network in the project&#13;
area is thus characterized by a large number of gaps. The LGED inventory shows that there&#13;
are 16,600 linear meters of structures and 9,600 lm of gaps on FRBs, and 58,700 Im of&#13;
structures and 86,700 Im of gaps on RRs. Details are presented in Table 1&#13;
3.3   Inventory of Hats and Ghats&#13;
There are a total of 425 growth center markets in the project area, out of which 100&#13;
markets have been covered under the RRMIMP and 136 markets have been proposed for&#13;
improvement under RRMIMP-Il. Moreover, a total of 41 ghats have been identified for&#13;
upgrading under RRMIMP-II.&#13;
4.    Present Responsibilities of LGED and External Support&#13;
4.1    The Local Government Engineering Department(LGED)&#13;
The task and authority of the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), an&#13;
agency of the LGD, is extensively described in Annex 1.3.&#13;
LGED's responsibilities which are directly relevant to the maintenance of rural&#13;
infrastructures in the area of the RRMIMP-2 project are:&#13;
* routine and periodic maintenance of FRBs, including structures.&#13;
*  the maintenance of important RR1 roads, and the maintenance of structures on Rural&#13;
Roads.&#13;
* the provision of technical supervision and advice to local government bodies to assist them&#13;
in fulfilling their responsibilities for the operation of rural infrastructures.&#13;
These responsibilities of LGED have to be seen equally in the national context of rural&#13;
infrastructure development, in which the department's broader infrastructure activities include&#13;
small-scale water resources, irrigation and flood control, rural water supply and sanitation,&#13;
urban infrastructure development in secondary and rural towns, and construction of cyclone&#13;
shelters and primary schools. Following the objectives of the Strategy for Rural Development&#13;
Projects, LGED emphasizes the use of labour-intensive methods for construction and&#13;
maintenance works wherever appropriate.&#13;
4.2    External Assistance to Maintenance of Rural Infrastructures&#13;
Due to the fact that the Government is responsible for maintenance, only few donor-&#13;
assisted projects (e.g. RDP-6 and RDP-7) gave attention to maintenance with the exception of&#13;
maintenance by contractors in the first year after construction. This course is changing and&#13;
more external assistance is made available to strengthen the capacity of local institutions. The&#13;
ADB financed RDP-18 is to be mentioned, where a long-term technical assistance on&#13;
maintenance management, training, and management capability strengthening is provided,&#13;
through Rural Infrastructure Maintenance Cell (RIMC). The RESP/ISP provides support to&#13;
RIMC, focusing on road condition surveys. This is in the context of the improvement of the&#13;
data base for planning in general at Thana level. Discussions during appraisal have shown that&#13;
the coordination and integration of data collection and utilization should be further enhanced.&#13;
The ISP Training Unit offers training in maintenance to District and Thana Engineering staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 4 of 12&#13;
5.    Local Government Bodies&#13;
5.1    Union Parishad and TDCC&#13;
Since the last local government reform in 1991, the Union Parishads (UP) have been&#13;
given increased responsibilities for the maintenance of rural infrastructures (e.g. priority&#13;
setting in planning, preparation and supervision of contracts, financial autonomy), the Project&#13;
will have to put much efforts on capacity building at that level. Through the Union Market&#13;
Management Committees (UMMC) they are responsible for operation and maintenance of&#13;
markets, too. More details of the local government system are given in Annex 1.4.&#13;
An important platform for planning and programming of rural infrastructures is the&#13;
Thana Development Coordination Committee (TDCC), regrouping the Chairmen of all Union&#13;
Parishads as the voting members; the TDCC constitutes the lowest government body. More&#13;
direct participation by the users for planning and programming of rural infrastructure works&#13;
will be enhanced by the Project. The LGED Thana Engineer sits on the TDCC as non-voting&#13;
member.&#13;
In conjunction with the Local Government Division the project will further analyze&#13;
existing shortcomings in resource mobilization and will provide practical assistance to the local&#13;
government bodies in the project area, with emphasis on greater cost recovery from the leasing&#13;
of improved markets and retention of lease monies by local government bodies. Local&#13;
financing issues are discussed in more detail in Annex 1.04.&#13;
5.2   Present Exteral Assistance at Thana and UP-level for Infrastructure Management&#13;
Only routine maintenance of RRI and RR2 is substantially covered through well&#13;
designed food for work programs (Road Maintenance Program, RMP) giving job opportunities&#13;
to the poor. Funding is through counterpart funds generated by Canadian food aid. The&#13;
management support by CARE Bangladesh has been integrated into LGED in 1995-96.&#13;
6.    Maintenance Systems and Practices&#13;
6.1   Road (routine and periodic) Maintenance System, incl. structure&#13;
Since its establishment in 1992, LGED's Rural Infrastructure Maintenance Cell&#13;
(RIMC) has made considerable progress in establishing the framework for road maintenance by&#13;
setting up a preliminary road inventory system, introducing national maintenance guidelines&#13;
(July 1995) and establishing a training program. The assistance by ADB is in its early stages.&#13;
Although coordination meetings among staff of projects supporting capacity building for&#13;
maintenance (RDP-6, RDP-7 and ISP) have started, no detailed plan of action for the further&#13;
development of an appropriate maintenance management system could be presented to the&#13;
mission during appraisal. Such a plan of action shall be required prior to negotiation of the&#13;
project.&#13;
Thus it was agreed that the project will, in coordination with RIMC, introduce, test&#13;
and refine a planned routine and periodic road maintenance system for the LGED network in&#13;
the project area covering all FRB roads, important RR1 roads, and structures on FRBs and&#13;
RRs. This will demonstrate how maintenance work can be planned and implemented effectively&#13;
. It is expected that experience gathered within the project will be replicated nationally by&#13;
LGED.&#13;
Since there will be a significant stock of improved, bitumen-surfaced FRBs in the&#13;
project area at the start of the project, the implementation of planned road maintenance will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
157                                 Annex 2.8&#13;
Page 5 of 12&#13;
given immediate priority. The project will finance periodic maintenance (with the following&#13;
sliding scale: 80% years 1-3, 40% in year 4 and 20% in year 5). Routine maintenance will be&#13;
financed from the GOB revenue budget. The project will finance periodic maintenance of all&#13;
FRBs &amp; important RRs, and all structures on FRBs &amp; RRs in the project area.&#13;
6.2    Monitoring and Review of GOBILGED Guidelines&#13;
The guidelines of GOB/LGED define the following maintenance categories:&#13;
* Routine Maintenance (day to day work including earthwork and pavement patching)&#13;
* Periodic Maintenance (pavement re-sealing and structures)&#13;
* Emergency Maintenance (mainly flood damages during monsoons)&#13;
* Rehabilitation-type Maintenance (restoration of structure to its intended purpose)&#13;
The Project will follow these guidelines but will closely monitor the proposed&#13;
maintenance programs for the fourth category. It is a category of works which is normally not&#13;
to be funded by maintenance budgets. The risk lays in investing funds for rehabilitation instead&#13;
of maintenance. Furthermore, such funds often are used also for improvement and upgrading&#13;
of roads and structures. During mid term review the experiences will be analyzed and&#13;
eventually corrective measures be proposed.&#13;
Although emergency maintenance needs can by definition not be predicted, the&#13;
presently used system of block allocation to districts seems neither to be sufficient nor properly&#13;
accounted for. Experiences will be collected and reported at mid term review with the aim to&#13;
propose a more rational and efficient allocation of budgets if and when required.&#13;
6.3   Planning and Programming&#13;
Planning and implementation of LGED maintenance is in principle under the&#13;
responsibility of the Thana Engineer (TE). There is one Sub-Assistant Engineer (SAE) to&#13;
second the TE specifically for maintenance, although this does not happen in practice. The&#13;
Executive Engineer (XEN) has the approving and overall supervision authority of all such&#13;
maintenance activities in his district. In order to match with the available budgets, desirable&#13;
maintenance works per district and Thana need to be prioritized in an iterative programming&#13;
exercise. The GOB/LGED guidelines indicate criteria for prioritization:&#13;
i)    FRB constructed under foreign- aided projects&#13;
ii)    FRB with high traffic volume&#13;
iii)   other FRB (partially paved, missing structures)&#13;
iv)    Structures on Important Rural Roads (after meeting&#13;
demand of FRB) with priority on RCC structures&#13;
While these criteria are practical at the present stage, where there is limited network,&#13;
needing mainly routine maintenance, a rational network approach will have to be introduced to&#13;
properly integrate periodic maintenance of pavements. While it is estimated that periodic&#13;
pavement maintenance will be required every 5 years in average, the detailed and economically&#13;
optimal timing and level of intervention has to be defined individually for the road section&#13;
based on:&#13;
* pavement and surface condition expected future deterioration, dependent on type and&#13;
volume of traffic&#13;
* available funds&#13;
The project shall propose simple and flexible procedures to obtain the necessary data&#13;
and define the yearly periodic and routine maintenance program. Sufficient time will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
158&#13;
Annex 2.8&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
allowed to discuss the proposed annual programs prior to approval. The schedule of the&#13;
guidelines shall be monitored and any improvement can be proposed if deemed necessary. For&#13;
example, the inspection of the roads has to be carried out in May, which coincides with the end&#13;
of the construction season when LGED staff is generally very busy with supervision.&#13;
However, with the introduction of the AE &amp; SAE maintenance positions, this bottleneck&#13;
should be removed. In the context of increased participation the project shall assist LGED in&#13;
developing and introducing procedures to expand membership of the District Maintenance&#13;
Committees to include user representatives (bus and truck, auto-rickshaw and rickshaw&#13;
operators) in order to promote sharing of information and user input into selection of&#13;
maintenance priorities.&#13;
7.    Maintenance Needs and Funding&#13;
7.1    Maintenance Needs, Costs and Preliminary Estimate&#13;
An initial assessment has been made for the requirements of all FRBs (about 3,200&#13;
km), important RRs (1,000 km) and existing structures on FRBs &amp; RRs (45,000 linear meters)&#13;
in the project area. Tables 3 and 4 present an estimate of the needs and costs (including unit&#13;
cost) of routine and periodic maintenance within the project area, over the period 1995/96 to&#13;
2003/04. The tables are based on:&#13;
-     the existing stock and condition of the LGED network as defined in the road inventory,&#13;
excluding RR3 roads.&#13;
*     assumptions about the road improvements that will be carried out over the next nine&#13;
years (new stock).&#13;
-     the assumption that periodic maintenance should be applied to paved roads (FRBs &amp;&#13;
RRs) and structures (FRBs &amp; RRs) in maintainable condition, and that periodic maintenance is&#13;
required every five years.&#13;
-     unit costs of routine and periodic maintenance which are derived from the consultants&#13;
and LGED figures.&#13;
The maintenance requirements of roads and structures will increase progressively as&#13;
the roads and structures in the project area become due for maintenance following the&#13;
improvement/construction under existing projects (RDP-7 &amp; RDP-6) and the new project&#13;
(RRMIMP-II). Details of the annual construction programs for the physical components are in&#13;
Annex 2.03 The subsequent maintenance requirements of, and the performance of routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance on the LGED road network in the project area will be monitored and&#13;
reported upon by the PIO with the assistance of the DSM consultants. The first year routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance program for the project area will be planned and prepared prior to&#13;
the project start.&#13;
7.2    Maintenance Funding&#13;
The maintenance funds allocated from the GOB revenue budget for LGED have&#13;
continuously increased from 3000 lakh Tk (US $7.5 million) in 1992-93 to 5500 lakh Tk (US&#13;
$13.8 million) in 1994-95, with a further increase to 6500 lakh Tk (US $16.3 million) for&#13;
1995-96. The main source of funds for maintenance of Rural Roads is the CARE Road&#13;
Maintenance Program (RMP). RMP was previously in the Ministry of Relief and funded&#13;
through Canadian food aid; it was transferred to LGED in 1995-96. RMP includes routine&#13;
maintenance of about 72,000 km of earth roads (mainly RRs and some FRBs) in about 3,600&#13;
Unions throughout the country (20 km per Union). Crews of destitute women (10 per Union)&#13;
are paid to maintain the roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

In addition, most of the RDPs have some budget allocation for maintenance of project&#13;
FRBs. The following Table shows the present situation of funding.&#13;

The estimated routine maintenance cost for 1995-96 for the project area is Tk. 1,193 lakh and periodic&#13;
maintenance cost for RRMIMP-II project period (1996-97 to 2000-2001) is Tk.12,190 lakh. It appears&#13;
that the available funds of LGED would in principle be sufficient to cover the routine maintenance of&#13;
all FRBs, important RRs and structures (FRBs &amp; RRs) in 1995-96, whereas the RMP/CARE program&#13;
covers most of earth roads (Rl &amp; R2) maintenance. Although the periodic maintenance costs will be&#13;
financed by the project during 1996-2001, the GOB maintenance allocation from 2001-2002 onward&#13;
has to be increased substantially to cover both routine and periodic maintenance of all rural&#13;
infrastructures in the project area.&#13;
Rehabilitation works shall only be funded from the maintenance budget if all routine and periodic&#13;
maintenance requirements are fully met.&#13;
[NOTE: Details of Maintenance funding sources and needs for the National System are given in Annex&#13;
1.31.&#13;
8.     Implementation&#13;
8.1    Routine Maintenance and Periodic Maintenance&#13;
The routine maintenance and periodic maintenance for the project are classified as&#13;
follows:&#13;
a)     Routine Maintenance of the Earth shoulders and Embankment Slopes, Care taking of&#13;
trees and Cleaning of waterways in structures:&#13;
-      trimming/filling and compaction of earth shoulders and slopes and reforming the&#13;
camber&#13;
-      cutting/removal of vegetation from road shoulders, slopes and structures&#13;
-      repair of rain-cuts , pot holes, ruts and rat-holes in the embankment&#13;
-      re-fining of turfing&#13;
-      care taking of trees&#13;

replacement of missing bricks in structures&#13;
minor concrete repair to structures&#13;
c) Periodic Maintenance of Road Pavement and Structures:&#13;
-     resurfacing&#13;
-     repairs of hard shoulders&#13;
-     replacement/repair/painting of all sign posts and guard posts&#13;
-     replacement of brickwork in structures&#13;
-      replacement of poor concrete and replastering&#13;
-      reforming of the railing on the bridge deck&#13;
-     painting of steel work&#13;
8.1.1  Work Standards and Implementation Methods&#13;
Routine maintenance of embankment earth shoulders and embankment slopes,&#13;
care taking of trees and cleaning of waterways in structures will be carried out by&#13;
groups of disadvantaged women, providing them with long-term employment. LGED&#13;
will enter into direct contracts with the group.&#13;
Routine maintenance of the pavement and structures will be carried out by the&#13;
contractors. Experiences in RDP-6 and RDP-7 show that the contractors are not&#13;
interested in small maintenance contracts. The project will thus seek to propose and&#13;
test alternative methods. One option could be, to let a contract for routine maintenance&#13;
of the carriageway covering maintainable network of a district or several Thanas.&#13;
Another option is the "term contract", which will let the contract of whole network of&#13;
a district for a given period (usually one year). Other options could also be explored&#13;
and tested by the project. The RIMC is still an early stage to develop the contracting&#13;
arrangements for routine pavement maintenance. The project will assist the RIMC in&#13;
developing and refining routine maintenance contracting procedures, including with&#13;
respect to the testing of different options in the field.&#13;
The periodic maintenance works will be carried out by the local contractors&#13;
prequalified under the project using the same contracting procedures as for FRB&#13;
improvement and upgrading works. The DSM consultants will prepare the engineering&#13;
designs, tender documents and engineers' estimates and will assist the PIO in the&#13;
evaluation of tenders and the processing of contract awards. Contracts for periodic&#13;
maintenance will be let over the period September to November each year so that&#13;
works can commence the following January. The periodic maintenance works will be&#13;
supervised by LGED with the assistance from the DSM consultants who will certify all&#13;
payments to the contractors. Quality control procedures and contractor defects liability&#13;
will be the same as for FRB construction works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
161                                Annex 2.8&#13;
Page 9 of 12&#13;
The project will assist LGED at District and Thana level in all aspects of&#13;
maintenance planning, implementation and management, inventory and condition&#13;
survey, contracting inspection and supervision as well as monitoring and reporting.&#13;
The project will provide low cost equipment and tools for routine maintenance&#13;
works, together with supervision vehicles since mobility of LGED staff is essential if&#13;
maintenance at dispersed sites is to be properly planned and supervised.&#13;
8.1.2 Procurement&#13;
Civil works for routine (carriageway) and periodic maintenance of roads will&#13;
be procured by National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Contract documents will be&#13;
prepared based on those used on RDP-7; moreover, they will be made consistent both&#13;
with GOB regulations and the latest World Bank Standard Bidding Documents for&#13;
Procurement of Smaller Contracts. Prequalification of contractors for project works&#13;
will be completed in accordance with the Bank's guidelines prior to project start, and&#13;
the prequalification will be updated by screening out the poorly performed contractors&#13;
at Mid Term Review.&#13;
Civil works for tree plantation and care taking on project FRB will be procured&#13;
by direct, annual contract with groups of disadvantaged women at fixed payment rates.&#13;
Contract documents for procurement of these works will be based on existing LGED&#13;
procedures.&#13;
8.2    Maintenance Management System&#13;
Based on the experience of the RDP-7, a Project Implementation Office (PIO) will he&#13;
established with its headquarters in Dhaka, headed by a Project Director (PD). The PIO will&#13;
work directly with the offices of the LGED XENs in the 14 project districts and, through them&#13;
with the offices of the Thana Engineers. The project will finance the PIO operating costs, the&#13;
PIO incremental staff positions (including maintenance staff) at Headquarters, District and&#13;
Thana level in the project area to provide implementation support to the LGED staff.&#13;
Under the project management, there will be a maintenance unit comprising separate&#13;
maintenance staff at the Headquarters, District and Thana level. The maintenance unit will be&#13;
headed by one Assistant Engineer (a senior and experienced Engineer) at the Headquarters. He&#13;
will be supported and assisted by the Maintenance Advisers (expatriate and local) under the&#13;
DSM Consultancy. One of the Assistant Engineers (AE) at District level (either incremental&#13;
staff or LGED staff) and one of the Sub Assistant Engineers (SAE) at Thana level (either&#13;
incremental staff or LGED staff), will be exclusively responsible for all maintenance activities.&#13;
Their positions will be AE (maintenance) and SAE (maintenance) respectively. The SAE will&#13;
carry out the road inventory, condition survey, planning, programming, supervision,&#13;
monitoring and reporting of maintenance activities of all rural infrastructures in the respective&#13;
Thana with the help of DSM consultants. He will assist the Thana Engineer in the procurement&#13;
of all maintenance contracts. He will report his activities to the AE (maintenance) at district&#13;
who will coordinate the maintenance works of all Thanas in the district and will report to the&#13;
AE (maintenance) at Headquarters. The positions of SAE (maintenance) and AE (maintenance)&#13;
will be on permanent basis which will be continued even after completion of the project. This&#13;
will help to sustain the maintenance system at local level. After the completion of the project,&#13;
these positions will be integrated in the RIMC.&#13;
The maintenance unit of the project will coordinate with the RIMC and with other RD&#13;
projects on specific issues to share views and experiences. The maintenance system and&#13;
practices to be developed in the project area should also be discussed with RIMC so that the&#13;
system, if found effective, could be replicated nationally through the RIMC.&#13;
&#13;

9.    Training&#13;
Training will be provided to LGED District and Thana staff to increase their capability to&#13;
implement maintenance works effectively. The training will include:&#13;
-     planning (including conduct of condition surveys)&#13;
-     inspection, supervision, monitoring and reporting&#13;
-     standardization and contracting of routine and periodic maintenance of pavements&#13;
-     work methods, techniques and implementation of routine maintenance (labour groups)&#13;
and   pavement maintenance&#13;
-     management and organization of Labour groups&#13;
The training will result in LGED staff at District and Thana level in the project area being able&#13;
and motivated to effectively plan, implement and manage routine and periodic maintenance.&#13;
The project will coordinate with the LGED training unit to design an effective training&#13;
program for maintenance in the project area in order to fulfill the objectives of the project's&#13;
maintenance component and also to avoid any duplication in training programs within LGED &amp; the&#13;
project.&#13;
Training will be provided to local bodies (Union Parishads, Market and Ghat Management&#13;
Committee) in the Information Sharing and Users Input approaches, and in management and&#13;
maintenance of roads, structures, markets and ghats.&#13;
The project will establish a coordination with the IDC of 2nd RRMP(RHD) as far as possible&#13;
and will share information and experiences to contribute to Human Resource Development of LGED.&#13;
10.   Growth Center Markets and Ghats&#13;
The participation in selection and detailed design of growth center markets and ghats will&#13;
develop a sense of local ownership of the improved markets. The project will assist and support the&#13;
formation of Market Management Committees, and will provide them with training and assistance in&#13;
planning and managing the operation and maintenance of the improved markets. Maintenance of the&#13;
improved markets will be financed from the 15% of lease revenue allocated to the Union Parishad for&#13;
this purpose. The MMC shall play a key role in the decision for the use of the maintenance funds&#13;
which will be administered by the Thanas. The market management procedure will include, along with&#13;
other aspects, the preparation of a budget and procedures for markets maintenance, and the&#13;
implementation of routine and periodic maintenance. The day to day maintenance (cleaning) of markets&#13;
is the responsibility of the lessee which is hardly in practice. To ensure the regular cleaning, the MMC&#13;
will take over the responsibility for cleaning the market from the lease holder, but at his cost, and&#13;
employ disadvantaged people for this work. Alternatively, the amount of money required for a year for&#13;
cleaning and day to day maintenance of the markets, could be taken as security from lessee. One&#13;
twelfth of this amount could be released at the end of each month to the lessee, provided the MMC&#13;
certifies that the requisite work has been performed satisfactorily.&#13;
The project will provide assistance to the formation of Ghat Management Committee and to&#13;
establish an effective operation and maintenance system of the ghats, using the same procedures as for&#13;
the markets. Emphasis will be placed on the setting of toll rates which will generate sufficient funds&#13;
for establishing maintenance a system.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT&#13;
AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
ASSESSMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
Since the project is larger and the implementation period shorter than the ongoing project&#13;
(RRMIMP-1), there is a question whether there is adequate implementation capacity to complete the&#13;
project as scheduled. Implementation capacity is related to mainly the following factors:&#13;
(a) the size of the project in terms of physical output;&#13;
(b) the implementation period;&#13;
(c) contractor capacity to complete the works; and&#13;
(d) LGED's capacity to manage the project( procurement, supervision, disbursement, and&#13;
monitoring).&#13;
These aspects with reference to the proposed project are discussed below: (a) . (b). and&#13;
:The national SRR component and NMT pilot component are reviewed separately as contractors&#13;
and agencies implementing them form a different category which does not compete with the rest of&#13;
the main project components which consist of the FRB roads, markets, and ghats. These latter are the&#13;
items which call on contractor capacity to the maximum. (The component on periodic maintenance is&#13;
an ongoing project through contractors and what the project will do is mainly to improve the quality&#13;
and only to small extent more coverage). In the first project, there were 500 kms of FRB roads, 65&#13;
growth center markets and no ghats, while the present project has 575 FRB roads, 135 markets, and&#13;
41 river ghats. Market improvements and ghat construction are comparable in the complexity, period&#13;
and cost of contracts ( about US $ 60,000 to 75,000 each) all done by small local contractors; one&#13;
market improvement contract can be equated to a contract of about 2km FRB road improvements (&#13;
from earth to BC paving; costing about $ 200,000) in terms contractual length and difficulties. On&#13;
this rough basis of output comparison, the physical output of this group of works under the first&#13;
project can be equivalent to about 630 kms of FRB improvements, as against 930 km FRB works&#13;
under the new project). This indicates a capacity increase of about 50% over the first project.&#13;
The above increase would be more intensive annually, considering the shorter span of&#13;
implementation period proposed in the second project ( five years). The first project actually would&#13;
take nine years, but effectively for comparison with new project only 7 years, because its first year&#13;
was lost due to delays in appointing supervision consultants and delays in issuing contracts which&#13;
will not happen in the present project as consultant's appointment is a condition of Board&#13;
presentation, and the first year bids would be invited before project approval by the Board; in&#13;
addition, the last year of the first project was mostly to cover the contractor's defect liability period&#13;
which, in the case of the new project, will fall outside the IDA-implementation period of five years&#13;
due to special arrangements being made (see para ...). Combining increased size and reduced time,&#13;
the new project needs to have a capacity increase of about 107 %. This increase is feasible due to the&#13;
following factors: larger project area, of about 75% ( increase from 8 districts to 14 districts); these&#13;
new areas have large number of suitable small contractors who operate there, as Bangladesh has a&#13;
long tradition of doing many projects through contractors; these contractors usually work in their&#13;
own localities, usually limited to one or two districts. (The first project's output in this group of&#13;
works was produced through about 280 smnall contracts involving about 100 different contractors,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

about 2.5 km road improvements per average contract, each contract running through about 10 to 15&#13;
months: Delete this later?). The project would further assist the contractors in&#13;
improving their capacity and work-quality through project supervision and training as done during&#13;
the first project. There has been adequate response from contractors with average three or four pre-&#13;
qualified contractors bidding for each contract. The experience of recent bidding for retroactive-&#13;
financing works under the new project in the new project districts showed a similar response for the&#13;
about 15 contracts recently bid and awarded, indicating adequate capacity and response in these new&#13;
areas as well.&#13;
Thus, about 75% capacity increase can be explained from the increased project area with its&#13;
own contracting capacity. The remaining extra capacity (of about 32% ) is expected from the fact that&#13;
the new project is not a pilot project and is built on lessons from the first project in trying out new&#13;
specifications, standards and procedures etc. ( see para..1...); LGED has become a much more&#13;
experienced body (now  implementing about US$1.5 billion worth of projects portfolio)  and&#13;
contractors have also become more experienced; the new project has also many measures to increase&#13;
contractor efficiency and capacity (larger size contracts of average 4-6 km, with 2-year contracts,&#13;
provision of mobilization advances for buying own equipment, higher standards in prequalifying&#13;
contractors, more training, etc.); it also will give about 100 km of the roads to a new category of&#13;
medium size contractors (for 10 km , US $1.0 m value contracts) who currently work on the main&#13;
roads projects, who will infuse new capacity to the feeder road sector). In addition, 45 km FRB&#13;
improvements have already started under retroactive financing before project approval. The second&#13;
project is much better prepared and its implementation in all aspects would be more efficient.&#13;
As regards the national components , the SRR components would be done through very small&#13;
Labour contractors ( contracts of about $8000 each), for which there is no shortage (see para.. on&#13;
SRR). The NMT component would be implemented almost entirely through experienced local NGOs&#13;
with minimal supervision from LGED.&#13;
2.     LGED's Capacity to Implement the Project&#13;
LGED's capacity, as noted, has expanded very much under various management&#13;
improvement measures, and would be further enhanced through the project and other donor support&#13;
(see para...). In addition, the project would provide incremental staff in the project areas, will have a&#13;
larger PIO with a separate deputy director for the new project districts as they need special attention&#13;
(see para....), and will have additional staff in LGED to look after the SRR components through&#13;
participatory specialists to be recruited; it will also have a large DSM consultants support appropriate&#13;
for the larger size project. A new feature would be technical audit , which will carry out regular six-&#13;
monthly inspection of work verification and technical quality as an additional control and monitoring&#13;
tool to ensure efficient and timely project implementation.&#13;
It should be emphasized here that the capacity increase of total 107% estimated above is&#13;
based on a 5-year implementation period for the new project. However, a sensitivity analysis shows&#13;
that if a 6- year implementation period is taken for the new project, the capacity increase needed is&#13;
only about 72%, which can be easily met from the area expansion factor alone (75%); the increased&#13;
capacity from efficiency factors would, in this case, provide considerable slack in capacity. This&#13;
means that one strategy for reducing any risk related to implementation capacity would be to extend&#13;
the implementation period by one year to 6 years at the time of the mid-term review, if considered&#13;
appropriate, based on an assessment of the performance and conditions at that time.&#13;

SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION PLAN AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
A. Monitoring And Evaluation Plan&#13;
1.    The proposed project would be monitored and evaluated both in terms of quantity and quality&#13;
from the perspective of input, output, outcome and impact. In order that the indicators should serve an&#13;
meaningful purpose, the project objectives and components/inputs has been adequately linked with the&#13;
expected processes, outputs and impacts. The 'input indicators' would measure the quantity of&#13;
resources provided, 'output indicators' would measure the quantity services that have been created,&#13;
'Outcome indicators' would measure the quantity of direct results that have been achieved through the&#13;
provision of project goods and services and the impact indicators would measure the degree to which&#13;
wider sector/project objectives are being achieved through the direct outcome of project activities.&#13;
2.    The input monitoring and evaluation would focus on weather all the required resources&#13;
including counterpart funding for maintenance and GOB's financing, are in place in timely fashion to&#13;
implement the program activities and services. The input information would include mainly on the&#13;
progress of land acquisition, and timely contract awards for the procurement of civil works, goods and&#13;
consulting services. The Input indicators would be regularly monitored and assessed through quarterly&#13;
and semi-annually and annually reports with an emphasis to identify problems in the delivery of inputs&#13;
so that they may be resolved before causing significant delays in progress achievements. The output&#13;
monitoring and evaluation would focus on the immediate results of activities, as demonstrated, for&#13;
example in kms of road build, number of structures completed, number of markets developed and&#13;
number of river jetties (ghats) constructed. LGED will monitor continuously all the input and output&#13;
indicators through progress reports and send the reports to IDA. The summary of the progress reports&#13;
would reflect the progress in respect of the proposed indicators, and in case of significant changes, the&#13;
reports would specify the reasons as well as the remedial action proposed.&#13;
3.    The 'Outcome' evaluation would focus on the direct results that have achieved through the&#13;
provision of project's services. This would be monitored by measuring number of vehicle usage in case&#13;
of feeder roads, mobility increased by increasing number of all weather rural roads, amount received&#13;
on leasing of markets and ghats, amount spent on regular maintenance of markets and ghats. The&#13;
Impact evaluation would measure the degree to which the project objectives are being achieved through&#13;
the direct outcome of the project activities. This would include efficient service delivery to number of&#13;
thanas, accessibility to number of poor communities in the rural areas, safety, cost efficiency, improve&#13;
service quality to reduce transportation cost, income generated from developed market and ghats; and&#13;
employment generated. It is proposed to launch a project workshops where all the stakeholders would&#13;
be invited to decide the responsibilities of each stakeholders and specifically focus on how and who&#13;
would maintain the baseline date for monitoring evaluation of all above referred indicators.&#13;
4.    During negotiations, assurance would be sought that: (a) quarterly and annual progress reports&#13;
for all project components would be prepared by the PD and submitted to the Chief Engineer LGED,&#13;
who in turn will submit them to IDA; (b) a joint mid term review would be conducted by July 1999,&#13;
whichever is earlier; and (c) an Implementation Completion Report would be submitted by the&#13;
Government to IDA within six months of the closing date of the project. The detailed format of the&#13;
quarterly and annual progress report will be agreed at negotiations.&#13;

5.     A sumnmary of performance indicators prepared in consultation with LGED, is provided in&#13;
Tables A and B. Except for impact indicators, the input, output and financial indicators, LGED would&#13;
monitored on a computer based program, which would also be used by IDA during the supervision&#13;
missions. The achievement of key indicators would be reflected in the supervision report form 590.&#13;
The guidelines for measuring the outcome and impact indicators would be designed during the project&#13;
launch workshop in consultation with the UPs, TDDC, and LGED. Based on the availability of the&#13;
base line data, the input, output and outcome indicators would be monitored during every supervision&#13;
mission, but the Impact indicators would be reviewed at the project start, mid-term review and&#13;
implementation completion.&#13;
IDA Supervision Requirements&#13;
6.     Table 1 summarizes resources needs for supervision. These inputs are in addition to resources&#13;
needs for the review of progress reports, procurement, supervision report preparation and&#13;
correspondence (which are estimated at six staff weeks (to be checked) per year throughout project&#13;
implementation).&#13;

7.     Main supervision missions (which are expected to be two per year) will be done in coordination&#13;
with SDC, which has agreed to actively support project supervision. In case efforts of coordination in&#13;
mission would result in timing conflict between IDA and SDC, the mission tinming proposed by IDA, the&#13;
lead agency, would prevail. SDC's contribution therefore will mainly consist of (a) active participation&#13;
on mid-year and annual review missions by SDC resident rnission, (b) active participation on the mid-&#13;
term review mission and other events of overall importance for project steering by SDC headquarters&#13;
and/or resident mission, and (c) making available additional local or foreign consultant services if&#13;
deemed necessary in specific areas such as maintenance or training or others. Those additional&#13;
consultant inputs will require prior consultation with IDA and LGED.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
LAND ACQUISITION ACTION PLAN: SUMMARY&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
The infrastructure works comprise construction of large numbers of small, widely scattered rural&#13;
schemes. Land acquisition is required only for improvement/upgrading of FRB roads. Strucures on other&#13;
FRB roads and on Rural Roads (SRR) will be built within existing alignments on public (khas) land. The&#13;
local government bodies will confirm, before implementation of any market or ghat scheme commences,&#13;
that there are no disputes over the public land on which the improved facilities will be constructed. If any&#13;
additional land is needed, no formal land acquisition will be involved, and the local government body will&#13;
arrange for purchase of the additional land prior to implementation.&#13;
FRB road improvement/upgrading works will be on existing road alignments. Land, or more&#13;
precisely asset, acquisition will be required to acquire:&#13;
Narrow strips of land adjacent to the existing embankments in order to widen and/or raise them to&#13;
meet the defined pavement cross-section standard.&#13;
*     On some FRB roads, land for minor re-alignment of sections of the existing embankment.&#13;
*     Standing trees, crops and small buildings within the widened road alignment.&#13;
2.    Impacts of Land Acquisition&#13;
Impacts have been assessed from a Land Acquisition Assessment (LAA) study based on surveys of&#13;
the land acquisition impact of FRB improvements under the RRMIMP and the RDP-6 projects; and a&#13;
Preliminary Inventory Survey of all FRB roads short-listed for improvement which included estimation of&#13;
the land area, and numbers of buildings and trees to be acquired.&#13;
The LAA confirmed the inadequacy of present land acquisition practices in Bangladesh. The level&#13;
of compensation is generally below the full replacement value; not all affected persons receive&#13;
compensation; and there can be long delays in payment of compensation, with physical occupation of the&#13;
land before payment is made.&#13;
Table I presents a summary of land acquisition impact by District. The project will acquire about&#13;
254ha. of land, 73% of it cultivated agricultural land, the remainder homestead land; about 260 small,&#13;
pernanent 'pucca' buildings; many more 'kutcha' buildings; and large numbers of trees'. The affected&#13;
persons will be owners of the agricultural, homestead and commercially developed land; owners of trees&#13;
and standing crops; owners of homestead dwellings and commercial buildings; mortgagees of land,&#13;
sharecroppers and agricultural labourers; renters of homestead dwellings; and owners and employees of&#13;
businesses operating from commercial buildings.&#13;
The environmental impact of loss of these trees will be more than compensated by the tree&#13;
plantation program on all improved FRB roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
188&#13;
Annex 3.8&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
Large numbers of people will be affected. About 24,000 households (estimated as 42 per km of&#13;
FRB road) will suffer losses. About 72% of affected households will lose agricultural land, and about 36%&#13;
homestead land. Land acquisition will be 'neutral' in its effect on different sectors of the rural population,&#13;
ie. affected households are a normal cross-section of landowners. The level of effect will be small. Land&#13;
acquisition equates to about 0.44ha per km of road or, on average, strips of land 2.2m wide on each side of&#13;
the existing embankments. Thus most households will lose narrow strips of land (plus standing trees and&#13;
buildings on that land) from their plots. Two-thirds of affected households will lose less than 5% of their&#13;
total land-holding, 87% less than 10%, and 98.5% less than 20%. The acquisition of land may result in a&#13;
few households having to re-locate their homesteads but numbers will be small, and their location cannot be&#13;
determined until land acquisition is underway on each road.&#13;

3.     Land Acquisition and Compensation Policy&#13;
Land acquisition will be carried out, within the legal framework of the Bangladesh Requisition of&#13;
Immovable Property Ordinance of 1982 and its subsequent amendments, by application of the agreed Land&#13;
Acquisition Action Plan (LAAP). The LAAP accords with World Bank Operational Directive OD 4.30 in&#13;
respect of minimising land acquisition, and ensuring full and prompt compensation of all project affected&#13;
persons (PAPs) for loss of assets and actual temporary loss of income so that PAPs are not adversely&#13;
affected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
189                                Annex 3.8&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
The land acquired will be the minimum needed to improve and upgrade the FRB alignments to the&#13;
defined technical standard. The alignments of the widened embankments will be carefully designed to avoid&#13;
all religious/historical sites, schools and large/important buildings; and to avoid buildings where permanent&#13;
businesses operate and to acquire lower value land wherever possible. Sections of road will be re-aligned&#13;
only for safety reasons (to increase radii of curves), or where re-alignment has less asset acquisition impact&#13;
than upgrading the existing alignment.&#13;
The compensation policy is presented in Table 2. Given that the level of impact on PAPs will be&#13;
small, it focuses on monetary compensation for losses. PAPs will be compensated at full replacement value&#13;
for loss of assets, estimated based on assessed local current market values of the assets. PAPs will be given&#13;
advance warning of land acquisition, and a three-month eviction period following payment of&#13;
compensation, so that they can take actions to deal with the disruption caused, and to minimise temporary&#13;
displacement problems. PAPs will also be allowed to salvage trees, standing crops and building materials&#13;
as additional compensation for any temporary displacement problems.&#13;
Since the area of land acquired from individual plots will be small, and PAPs will be given advance&#13;
warning of land acquisition, it is not necessary to compensate mortgagees, renters or sharecroppers of&#13;
agricultural land; renters of homestead dwellings; casual agricultural labourers; or for seasonal crops.&#13;
Where acquisition of homestead land results in the household which owns the land and the dwelling on that&#13;
land having to re-locate its homestead (defined as the plot size being reduced below 0.01 ha.) the household&#13;
will receive sufficient compensation to purchase a replacement plot and construct an equivalent dwelling.&#13;
The losses, and rights to compensation, of genuine uthulis (persons who construct buildings on&#13;
private land with the permission of the landowner) and squatters (persons who construct buildings on&#13;
private or public land without the permission of the landowner) are recognised. As owners of buildings they&#13;
will be compensated for the value of the buildings. If they are operating businesses from those buildings&#13;
they will be compensated for temporary loss of income. If they have trees or perennial standing crops on&#13;
public land they will be compensated for the value of these. In the unlikely event that serious problems are&#13;
encountered with a large concentration of genuine uthulis/squatters within the alignment of a particular&#13;
road, LGED will adopt additional contingency measures, including the possibility of re-location assistance&#13;
(provision of a plot of land or of a cash grant equivalent) to deal with this.&#13;
While PAPs will be fully compensated, exploitation of the procedure and over-compensation will&#13;
be minimised. Measures will be adopted to discourage the construction of 'fraudulent buildings' by&#13;
landowners, uthulis or squatters simply in order to obtain compensation. Also, the project will not&#13;
compensate for temporary selling platforms and the like which can bc uplifted, removed and re-located&#13;
elsewhere without loss of value.&#13;

4.    Institutional Arraiwements and Implementation Procedures&#13;
The Deputy Commissioner's (DC) office in each District will acquire the land, acting on behalf of&#13;
LGED as the requiring body. To support the DCs, and to ensure timely implementation in accordance with&#13;
the LAAP, LGED will take a pro-active role. As a rural development agency with a social as well as&#13;
technical perspective, and with offices in every District and Thana, LGED is well-placed to do this. The&#13;
key LGED actors will be the District XENs, the Thana Engineers, and the Community Organisers at thana&#13;
level. They will be supported by the PIO, whose incremental staffing includes a Sociologist in each of the&#13;
14 project Districts, and the Design, Supervision and Monitoring Consultants (DSMC), whose staffing&#13;
includes two national Land Acquisition Field Advisers. The DSMC advisers will work full-time on land&#13;
acquisition and will set up and operate the monitoring system. The incremental staffing also includes a&#13;
Socio-Economist in PIO headquarters in Dhaka to work on land acquisition and participation aspects, and&#13;
a Sociologist in LGED headquarters who, inter-alia, will develop LGED land acquisition practices. Union&#13;
Parishads will be involved in the information campaign and grievance redressal procedure.&#13;
This is the first Bank-financed project in Bangladesh where land acquisition procedures&#13;
conforming to OD 4.30 will involve only government machinery, without availing of NGO support. As&#13;
such it represents a major step forward in the institutionalization of land acquisition procedures.&#13;
The implementation strategy allows ample time for land acquisition so that, for each year of full&#13;
implementation of FRB works, it can be completed prior to the planned start of construction. The annual&#13;
implementation schedule (Figure 1) allows a 13 month period for land acquisition up to the end of the three&#13;
month eviction period, so that land is available for physical occupation by LGED prior to completion of&#13;
road construction contract tendering. The schedule allows some slack for delays in the process.&#13;
At the time of submission of the case to the DC, the DSMC will make a photographic record of the&#13;
road, to document the pre-existence of buildings and trees on the alignment, as one measure to discourage&#13;
'fraudulent' compensation claims. A Joint On-Site Inventory and Verification will be carried out, involving&#13;
the LAO, LGED, the DSMC Field Adviser, and the PAPs. This will define and record the PAPs, the assets&#13;
to be acquired, the losses, and any disputes over ownership of assets. People within the vicinity of the road&#13;
will be informed in advance of the exercise. This inventory and verification will form the basis for all&#13;
subsequent stages of the land acquisition, and for monitoring.&#13;
The DSMC Field Adviser and the PIO will undertake a market survey in the area of each road to&#13;
assess the values of agricultural, homestead and developed commercial land; of buildings; and of standing&#13;
trees and perennial crops. LGED and the P10 will then negotiate with the DC with the aim of reaching&#13;
agreement on assessed values that reflect full market values. If such agreement is not reached, and if the&#13;
DC's assessed values are lower than LGED's market values, LGED will make additional, 'top up' payments&#13;
directly to PAPs. Payment of compensation to PAPs will be made at Union headquarters, in order to avoid&#13;
the problems that PAPs often face in travelling long distances to obtain small compensation amounts.&#13;
LGED will assist the DC in arrangements to make these payments. There will be some cases, where&#13;
ownership of assets is unresolved, or where legal disputes are in process, that will not be completed prior to&#13;
physical occupation of the land.&#13;

5.    Information, Assistance and Grievance Procedures&#13;
LGED will disseminate information about the land acquisition and compensation process. The&#13;
information campaign in the vicinity of each road, which will involve the Union Parishad and will include&#13;
the posting of notices and the distribution of leaflets, will start when the case is submitted to the DC.&#13;
LGED will inform people that it is intended to acquire land. It will advise them of the procedures to be&#13;
adopted and of the assets and losses that will be compensated (and of those that will not be compensated);&#13;
of the persons entitled to compensation; of their rights and the steps that they should take to protect those&#13;
rights; and of the assistance available from LGED to resolve problems and grievamces. During the Joint&#13;
On-Site Inventory and Verification PAPs will again be advised of the procedures and of the support&#13;
available from LGED. After the issue of Notice No.7, PAPs will be informed of compensation payments&#13;
arrangements. At the time payments are made, PAPs will be informed of the time they have to vacate the&#13;
land, and of the entitlement to salvage certain assets.&#13;
LGED will assist PAPs to resolve queries and redress grievances. The grievance redressal&#13;
procedure will operate through a committee in each Thana chaired by the Thana Engineer and comprising&#13;
the District Sociologist and a member of the Union Parishad, which will meet regularly (about twice per&#13;
month) at advertised times at the TE's office, when PAPs can formally present and discuss their queries and&#13;
grievances. PAPs can ask a Union Parishad member to assist them. This committee will resolve some&#13;
matters, and will determine that certain grievances are not legitimate. Where necessary, the committee will&#13;
ask the District Sociologist, assisted by the DSMC Field Adviser, to follow-up. This may involve field&#13;
investigations on-site with the PAP and his/her Union Parishad representative. The committee will then&#13;
meet again with the PAP to review the findings of the investigation. For legitimate grievances which the&#13;
committee is unable to resolve, a report will be submitted to the XEN, who will take further steps to resolve&#13;
the grievance and if necessary will submit a formal request to the DC to consider the matter. The Thana&#13;
Engineer will maintain a register of all queries and grievances presented to the committee, and of the&#13;
actions taken and decisions made. This grievance procedure will not replace the existing legal appeal&#13;
process, but will minimise the number of cases that reach the stage of legal action and will expedite the&#13;
resolution of problems.&#13;
6.    Monitoring and Reporting Procedure&#13;
The DSM consultants, working with the PIO Sociologist, will monitor the progress and&#13;
performance of land acquisition. The project Annual Plan of Operations (APO) will include targets for&#13;
objectively verifiable indicators of progress of land acquisition. Monitoring and reporting will be based on&#13;
comparison of actual progress on each road with these targets. Key progress indicators will be:&#13;
*      Date of submission of land acquisition case to DC&#13;
*     Date of completion of land market survey&#13;
*     Number of plots acquired&#13;
The Joint On-Site Inventory and Verification will form the basis for monitoring performance. A&#13;
computerised data-base will be set up for each road to record information for each identified PAP. It will&#13;
then be used to track the performance of land acquisition as implementation proceeds. Performance will be&#13;
monitored in terms of&#13;
&#13;

location&#13;
*     Resolution of grievances&#13;
*     Numbers of legally disputed and other unresolved cases&#13;
*     Compliance with the eviction period&#13;
The project will report twice per year on progress and performance. This will be incorporated into&#13;
the relevant project quarterly progress reports. The DSMC, as part of their input to the SEM&amp;E activities,&#13;
and in collaboration with PIO and LGED SEM&amp;E staff, will undertake broader studies of the impact of&#13;
land acquisition on affected persons. The IDA and SDC will review the progress and performance by&#13;
LGED of land acquisition as part of project supervision. About once per year, as required by IDA/SDC, an&#13;
independent review of compliance by LGED of the policies set out in the LAAP will be carried out.&#13;
7.    Budget&#13;
The costs of land acquisition have been estimated using the data on quantities from the Preliminary&#13;
Inventory Survey, and the findings from the LAA on market values of assets. Table 3 details the direct cost&#13;
by District for acquisition of land, buildings and trees. The total estimated cost is Taka 150.8 million&#13;
(US$3.77 million), or 7.3% of total FRB improvement and upgrading costs. The total cost is based on&#13;
broad estimates of unit values of assets, and given this degree of uncertainty a 25% physical contingency&#13;
has been included for land acquisition. Land acquisition will be 100% GOB financed.&#13;
Table 3 also details the overhead and administrative costs of implementing the land acquisition&#13;
process in accordance with the LAAP. The estimated cost is Taka 16.1 million (US$0.4 million), about&#13;
11% of the direct cost of land acquisition. In addition, some permanent LGED District and Thana staff will&#13;
spend time on land acquisition matters. The total direct, overhead and administrative cost of land&#13;
acquisition, including physical and price contingencies, is estimated at Taka 219.3 million (US$5.5&#13;
million).&#13;

SECOND RURAL ROADS AND MARKETS IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT: SUMMARY'&#13;
1.    Introduction&#13;
The project is not expected to have a major impact on the physical or ecological environment. No new&#13;
road alignments are involved. The proposed works are improvement, upgrading and maintenance of&#13;
existing roads and will have positive environmental impacts - the provision of drainage structures will&#13;
reduce waterlogging; bitumen surfacing will eliminate the dust hazard; the hard shoulders will improve&#13;
safety; road safety measures will be applied to reduce congestion and accidents; and trees will be&#13;
planted on the embankment slopes of all project roads, more than compensating for tree felling during&#13;
construction. The physical environment, health standards and quality of life in the markets and ghats&#13;
will be improved through provision of free-draining paved areas, hygienic latrines, garbage disposal&#13;
facilities and potable water supplies. Bio-gas generators will be installed at markets to process solid&#13;
waste. The use of labour-intensive construction and maintenance methods, and of local materials&#13;
provides a sound environmental approach, and the use of environmentally-friendly construction&#13;
materials will be promoted, including bitumen emulsion which eliminates the need for firewood to heat&#13;
bitumen. The environmental category for this project is Category B.&#13;
LGED has carried out an environmental impact study with assistance from the preparation consultants,&#13;
based on LGED environmental guidelines, to identify all positive and negative project impacts and&#13;
define the mitigation measures. This has been used to prepare a Sectoral Enviromnental Assessment.&#13;
2.    Measures to Mitigate Negative Environmental Impacts of Road Improvements&#13;
The potential negative impacts are primarily related to the FRB works. Table 1 details these - classified&#13;
as High, Medium and Low risk - the proposed mitigation measures, and responsibilities for those&#13;
measures, which will be applied to design, contracting, supervision, and operation of roads.&#13;
Design&#13;
Environmental considerations are incorporated into the technical design standards. Alignments will be&#13;
adjusted to avoid cultural features. Sufficient structures will be provided, with adequate openings, to&#13;
maintain natural drainage and navigability of channels - locations and sizes of structures will be&#13;
determined based on field surveys, consultations with local people, and hydrological investigations.&#13;
All improved embankments will be above the high flood level, constructed from suitable soil and&#13;
mechanically compacted, with rigorous testing. Cambers and embankment slopes are specified to shed&#13;
surface water and maintain soil stability, and erosion protection measures will be applied where&#13;
necessary. All roads will be constructed with hard shoulders on each side of the pavement, and road&#13;
safety signs and warning markers will be installed. Road safety measures will be incorporated at&#13;
junctions, blackspots and adjacent to markets. Four project roads are within wildlife sanctuaries&#13;
(Bhawal, Bil Bhatia and Chalan Beel) but project activities will not disturb the critical natural habitats.&#13;
' Details are in the Project file, in Document entitled "Sectoral Environmental Assessment for RRMIMP-2"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.9&#13;
198                                  Page 2 of 6&#13;
Contracting&#13;
The contract documents incorporate environmental considerations. They detail the design standards and&#13;
the procedures for testing of soil and compaction. They define the responsibilities of, and the&#13;
procedures that will be adopted by, contractors for location and operation of site camps; location,&#13;
excavation and reinstatement of borrow pits; temporary diversion of water channels and protection of&#13;
unstable embankments; haulage of materials; storage and handling of materials; disposal of waste; and&#13;
provision of road diversions and temporary traffic safety measures during construction.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
The compliance of contractors with the environmental requirements will be supervised by LGED, with&#13;
the assistance of the DSM consultants. Soil and compaction testing will be a key element of&#13;
supervision. LGED supervision staff will be trained in supervision of environmental aspects of&#13;
construction works. Attention will be paid to mitigating negative impacts of disposal of waste&#13;
materials, and the project will develop standards and indicators to monitor this. Trees will be planted&#13;
on road embankment slopes, except on the inside of curves.&#13;
Operation&#13;
Routine maintenance will be applied to all project roads, including caretaking of the trees. This will&#13;
mitigate against longer-term negative environmental impacts and sustain the environmental benefits.&#13;
Maintenance of the smooth road surfaces will encourage the use of non-motorised transport (NMT).&#13;
The pilot program to improve NMT will also promote the use of environmentally sound vehicles. The&#13;
extension of routine and periodic maintenance to non-project roads will enhance the environment.&#13;
Local government bodies will be encouraged to control development adjacent to the roads.&#13;
3.     Measures to Mitigate Negative Environmental Impacts of Market and Ghat Improvements&#13;
The environmental impacts of market and ghat improvements will be predominantly positive. Users&#13;
will participate in the detailed design of the improvements to ensure that the numbers and types of&#13;
facilities - including latrines and potable water supplies - meet local requirements. The main potential&#13;
negative impact is if inadequate provision is made for the drainage and disposal of surface and waste&#13;
water. The following measures will be taken to mitigate against this:&#13;
*     The DSM consultants will establish the design levels of the market and ghat paved areas to&#13;
ensure that they are free-draining. Internal drains, designed for easy cleaning, will be provided&#13;
in the market/ghat areas. Adequate, safe drain outfalls will be designed to ensure that there is&#13;
no drainage congestion.&#13;
*     LGED and the DSM consultants will supervise construction works to ensure that the paved&#13;
areas are built to the design levels and grades, and with the necessary outfalls. The project will&#13;
train LGED staff in the supervision of market and ghat construction.&#13;
*     The project will develop the capability of the Market and Ghat Management Committees to&#13;
maintain the markets and ghats. Improved procedures for cleaning the markets, maintaining&#13;
free-drainage and disposing of garbage will be introduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.9&#13;
199                                Page 3 of 6&#13;
Following the pilot initiative taken by LGED under the RDP-6 project, bio-gas generators will be&#13;
installed in improved markets to process human, animal and vegetable waste to produce gas and&#13;
compost. Management Conmnittees will be trained in the operation of the generators.&#13;
4.    Monitoring&#13;
Monitoring of short-term negative environmental impacts during the construction phase will be&#13;
integrated into the supervision of the works. Longer-term environmental impacts of road improvement&#13;
works will be monitored in four ways:&#13;
*     Monitoring of compliance with design standards and specifications will be part of the&#13;
supervision of construction works.&#13;
The regular inspection of roads for the planning and implementation of maintenance will&#13;
generate data on their condition in respect of erosion, surface condition, state of tree&#13;
plantations, blockage of drainage structures and condition of road signs and markings.&#13;
Project SEM&amp;E activities will include regular traffic counts on improved roads, generating&#13;
data to monitor changes in the levels of motorised and non-motorised traffic.&#13;
*     Special surveys will be carried out of a sample of improved roads to monitor the extent to&#13;
which any of the following negative impacts are occurring:&#13;
-     turbidity of roadside water;&#13;
-     drainage congestion during floods;&#13;
-     interference with boat communications;&#13;
-     pollution of surface and ground water;&#13;
-     disruption of fish migration and breeding;&#13;
-     encroachment of commercial and residential activities.&#13;
*     Monitoring of the environmental situation of improved markets and ghats will be incorporated&#13;
into monitoring of the effectiveness of project actions to increase the capability of Market and&#13;
Ghat Management Committees.&#13;
The project will report annually on the environmental impact of its activities, and on the effectiveness&#13;
of avoidance, mitigation and enhancement measures. The PIO staffing includes a full-time&#13;
Environmental Engineer who will have direct responsibility for monitoring and reporting.&#13;
5.    Institutional Strengthening&#13;
LGED has a program to address environmental issues at the planning and design stages. It has&#13;
guidelines on environmental assessment and two in-house environmental specialists. The guidelines are&#13;
now being revised. LGED also has an environmental training program for XENs.&#13;
The National Environmental Management Action Plan (NEMAP) will provide the national policy&#13;
framework on environmental management within which LGED will operate in future. LGED would&#13;
benefit from an in-house Environmental Unit to be responsible for environmental planning and&#13;
management. The LGED training program on environmental impact assessment should be expanded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

200                                  Annex 3.9&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
and made mandatory for all levels of personnel. Training in environmental matters should be extended&#13;
to contractors, and to Union Parishads and Market and Ghat Management Committees.&#13;
LGED should develop standard clauses on environmental aspects, similar to those adopted for the&#13;
RRMIMP-2, for inclusion in technical specifications and conditions of contract, together with&#13;
procedures for monitoring and supervision of mitigation measures during construction. The integration&#13;
of environmental concerns into LGED planning procedures, and the increased participation of local&#13;
people in all stages of infrastructure development, will enhance LGED's environmental performance.&#13;

            Bangladesh - Second Rural Roads and Markets
            Improvement and Maintenance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Second Rural Roads
            and Markets Improvement and Maintenance Project is to help
            increase rural employment and incomes and reduce rural
            poverty. More specifically, the project will: a) help remove
            physical bottlenecks, improve quality, and reduce costs in
            rural transport and marketing; b) create employment and
            income-generating opportunities among the rural poor; c)
            promote participation of local communities and NGOs in
            project activities; and d) increase institutional capacity
            for efficient rural infrastructure management. The main
            components of the project are: a) improvement and upgrading
            of feeder roads; b) establishment and implementation of a
            road network maintenance system; c) culvert and bridge
            construction; d) physical improvement of rural markets; e)
            rehabilitation and construction of river jetties; f) pilot
            program to improve safety and efficiency of non motorized
            transport, particularly rickshaws; g) supply of road
            construction and maintenance equipment, vehicles, and office
            and training equipment; i) institutional and human resources
            development; and j) implementation support.
