FARM PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
I. AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN AZERBAIJAN: PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Reform and restructuring of the agricultural sector in Azerbaijan is vital to improve the living&#13;
standards of the rural people, who comprise 46 percent of the growing population. The agriculture sector&#13;
employs an estimated 36 percent of the labor force, and contributes between 26 and 30 percent of its&#13;
GDP. It generates about 30 percent of total exports mostly from cotton, fruits and vegetables. Increasing&#13;
agricultural productivity in the immediate term is important and will continue to be in the future, even&#13;
if the foreign exchange earnings from petroleum exports were to recover. After independence in 1991,&#13;
agricultural production declined (by 13 percent in 1994 following declines of 12 and 25 percent in the&#13;
preceding two years) and yields have dropped by 30 percent or more for grain, cotton, grapes and&#13;
tobacco. The overall contribution of agriculture to exports has also declined from about 30 percent to&#13;
about 10 percent since 1991. Traditionally, agricultural production mostly occurred on collective and&#13;
state farms, which is gradually being replaced by individual private farms. Agriculture encompasses nine&#13;
distinct agro-climatic zones giving rise to a highly diversified crop mix. It is dependent on irrigation and&#13;
imports of the key inputs, viz. hybrid seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, farm machinery and equipment. About&#13;
half of the total agricultural land (4.4 million ha) is used for crop production with the remainder being&#13;
used for natural pastures. About 75 percent of the land (1.5 million ha) used for crop production is&#13;
dependent on irrigation.&#13;
B. PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
1.2   The main problems and the opportunities in the agricultural sector are:&#13;
(i)    Weak Institutional Support: The traditional role of the Government to guide and provide&#13;
all the necessary means for agricultural production, distribution and marketing for&#13;
agricultural inputs and outputs has been on the decline during the last four years.&#13;
However, the absence of alternative support systems has led to rent seeking and control&#13;
by the few remaining Government monopolies. There is a need to redefine the role of&#13;
the public and private sectors in the agricultural sector - strengthening those Government&#13;
institutions which must continue to play a role in a market economy to provide research,&#13;
extension, public infrastructure and developing private structures to perform direct&#13;
production, marketing and trade;&#13;
(ii)   Incomplete Liberalization of the Sector: Complete liberalization in output prices of&#13;
perishable products, viz., fruits, vegetables and livestock products has taken place,&#13;
which has led to their production almost exclusively in the private sector. However, the&#13;
agro-processing industries still continue to be predominantly in the public sector, thereby&#13;
limiting the realization of the full production potential and income increasing&#13;
opportunities in these products. The Government has partially liberalized the wheat and&#13;
cotton sectors. With respect to wheat, although the Government is committed to buy 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
percent of production at domestic market prices, it is unable to do so due to the hard&#13;
budget constraints and the producer's requirement for delivery on a cash basis only. In&#13;
response to these policy changes, the domestic prices of wheat has been rising and they&#13;
are currently about 55 percent of the average projected import parity price of about&#13;
US$175/mt (1997-2001).   With  respect to  cotton, while state orders have been&#13;
eliminated, the Government owned ginneries offer the only alternative, at the present&#13;
time, for the producers to sell their cotton. While the privatization of the cotton&#13;
ginneries is being contemplated, the government has consistently raised the procurement&#13;
price closer to export parity price equivalent. The current farm gate price for cotton has&#13;
moved significantly towards export parity prices (from US$205/mt during 1994 to&#13;
US$290/mt during 1995 compared to the average projected export parity price of&#13;
US$335/mt (1997-2001). These price increases are having the desired effect on farm&#13;
profitability, which has shown an improvement in the last year; and&#13;
(iii) Slow Implementation of Land Reforms: The Government's overall land policy aims at&#13;
providing security of land tenure to individuals in the near term and creation of land&#13;
markets in course of time. The Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic provides for&#13;
private land ownership (Article 29) and was adopted by a National Referendum on 12&#13;
November 1995. In this regard, after much debate and time, the Parliament has passed&#13;
the Land Reform Law (July 16, 1996), which would legalize private land ownership and&#13;
establish the land distribution procedures. The principle features of this land reform law&#13;
are described in Text Box 1.1.&#13;
Box 1.1 Principle features Sof Land Reform Law passed by the Parliament:&#13;
* Provides for privawe ownetship of land, permanent, temporary and leasing of land and land use types, land&#13;
owner's ights,h users and leasers (Article 4);&#13;
* Establishes common land fund, defines types of land which could be pnrvatized and those which would remain&#13;
under Government jurisdiction (Articles 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12);&#13;
* Gives authorit to regional and local :agricultural refonn conmissions to implement provisions of land law&#13;
(Article 5);:&#13;
* Defines principles and procedures to determine die area of land to be allotted to the individual (Article 16);&#13;
* Provides for exit mechanism with the land or its value for those wishing to leave the farm (Article 13);&#13;
* Defines eligibility criteria for obtaining land from sovkhozesikolkhozes (Article 15); and&#13;
* Establishes procedures for detennining cost of land; defines buying, selling and mortgaging regulations&#13;
(Articles 19, 20, 21:,22, 23):&#13;
imoratonum on sale of land for initial 5 years after receiving the lanid allotment (Article 23);&#13;
- provides for ceiling: on private individual toeownagricultural and non-agricultural land (Article 21); and&#13;
- permits mortgaging of land within 3 years for undertaking 'farm activities (Article 24).&#13;
The procedures for the implementation of the Land Reform Law are being evolved and&#13;
appropriate amendments would be made in the land code, which was passed by the&#13;
Government in November 1991. During this transitionary process, agricultural lands,&#13;
in selected raions, are being operated on by voluntarily created groups of former state&#13;
and collective farm employees as though they have been privatized and have land&#13;
ownership rights. The passage of the land reform law by the Parliament and its signing&#13;
by the President provides an opportunity to create the appropriate institutional&#13;
mechanisms to legitimize the land privatization processes already taking place at the&#13;
grass-roots level. It would also provide security of land tenure to individuals to set up&#13;
and operate independent farms and any other types of private farm organizations in the&#13;
five representative farms of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iv)   Border Uncertainties: Although the open hostilities over the Nagorno-Karabakh region&#13;
have come to an end and progress has been made in negotiations for a durable settlement,&#13;
the country continues to confront a large economic burden as a result of the internally&#13;
displaced and refugee population of about one million (about 13 percent of the total&#13;
population). Moreover, the continuing severance of transport links with Russia in the&#13;
northern border has disrupted traditional marketing channels.&#13;
C. WORLD BANK INITIATIVES&#13;
1.3    The Bank's agricultural sector review (July 1995) concluded that Azerbaijan has considerable&#13;
production potential in many agricultural commodities, especially in cotton, grain, vegetables, fruits and&#13;
silk production, given the availability of water resources, developed irrigated areas, and stable agro-&#13;
ecological systems. It has identified the following areas for action: (a) land privatization and farm&#13;
restructuring of state and collective farms; (b) implementation of market oriented price and trade policies;&#13;
(c) demonopolization and privatization of state agribusiness enterprises; (d) development of an appropriate&#13;
rural financial system to serve private farming and agro-enterprises; (e) improve efficiency of water&#13;
delivery and use for agriculture; and (f) realignment of the role of the Government in the agricultural&#13;
sector.&#13;
1.4    The CAS for FY97-99 was developed in collaboration with the Government and focuses on&#13;
agriculture, poverty alleviation and post war reconstruction. The Bank's program would emphasize four&#13;
main areas: (i) enhancement of competitiveness in critical economic sectors: for the CAS period, the&#13;
sector focus will be on agriculture with emphasis on: (a) creation of land markets and accelerating the&#13;
privatization of state and collective farms within an appropriate transparent legal framework; (b)&#13;
demonopolization of state owned enterprises involved in input and output marketing channels and&#13;
commodity exchange; (c) designing a rural credit scheme to serve the emerging private farmers; and (d)&#13;
rehabilitation of dilapidated irrigation and drainage systems and rural infrastructure; (ii) establishment of&#13;
a policy and institutional framework conducive to efficient and equitable private sector led sustainable&#13;
growth. This would be implemented through mainly institution building components in agriculture,&#13;
finance and industrial sectors; (iii) alleviating poverty through the development of improved targeting of&#13;
social assistance, increasing efficiency of health care services, and designing a national poverty alleviation&#13;
strategy; and (iv) resettlement and rehabilitation of IDPs and refugees through building institutional&#13;
capacity in the Government to support and implement the reconstruction effort and undertaking&#13;
reconstruction of occupied territories. These program initiatives translate into a base case lending&#13;
program of four IDA and one IBRD operations totalling US$170 million over FY97-99. If the country&#13;
performance improves, the lending program would expand to comprise up to five IDA and two IBRD&#13;
operations totalling US$295 million over the FY97-99 CAS period, which is about US$12 per capita per&#13;
annum - an average for similarly performing economies.&#13;
1.5    The farm privatization project is fully consistent with the CAS and has been developed in close&#13;
consultation with the Government. The project directly supports the Government's program to transform&#13;
the agricultural sector into one based on market principles. The Government's recent initiatives to create&#13;
an appropriate policy environment for land privatization and farm restructuring provides the basis for the&#13;
proposed project. Successful and speedy implementation of the proposed project would induce more&#13;
efficient use of scarce resources and enable the new farm structures to base their production decisions on&#13;
market forces rather than to the dictates of the state.&#13;

II. LAND PRIVATIZATION AND FARM RESTRUCTURING&#13;
A. LAND PRIVATIZATION&#13;
2.1      The Government is placing high priority&#13;
on privatization of the agrarian sector. The Land&#13;
Reform    Law   provides   for  individual  land                Box 2.1: Steps in Land&amp;AUocation and&#13;
ownership  which would permit the freedom  to                                Registration&#13;
use, buy, sell, present, exchange, mortgage, rent&#13;
out and inherit land.  The implementation of the                One:.    Formation of local commission with representatives&#13;
land law has two aspects: (i) administration of the                       of l:farm  employees,   village  administration,&#13;
community  groups  to  decide  the  farm&#13;
process;  and  (ii) registration  of  land  of  the                       reorgamnizationi&#13;
prospective landowners.  The administration of&#13;
the process is the responsibility  of a three-tier              Two:    Demarcation of land within each farm for prvate&#13;
of:   (a)   federal   level  ~   Iownership, together with limited arem  that will&#13;
system    consisting    of:   (a)   federal   level                       remain under state an municipal ownership ;&#13;
commission;  (b) raion  level  agrarian  reform&#13;
commission; and  (c) local commissions at the                   Three:,   Determination of list of citizens who would have&#13;
farm  or village level. At raion and local levels,                        rightstoprvatzedland - qualifyingiafutid&#13;
or village level                                 1~~~~~~~~~~~~i di  land reformn  law and qualifying imividuals&#13;
the membership to the commission is elected by                            for each farm   deternmined  by raion and local&#13;

B. PRESENT STATUS OF FARM RESTRUCTURING&#13;
2.3    Until 1991, the farming structure in Azerbaijan consisted of 983 collective farms and 820 state&#13;
farms, cultivating a total of 1.46 million hectares. The Government intends to privatize 70 percent of&#13;
the farms and agribusinesses as soon as possible. However, the progress in creating the necessary&#13;
conditions and implementation has been slow due to lack of resources and the know-how. The decision&#13;
making process for farm restructuring involves the following steps: the raion Administration notifies the&#13;
eligible farms to submit their proposals for privatization of the farm for consideration and approval. The&#13;
decision to re-organize is taken by the local farm Commission'!. The concerned farm in the General&#13;
Body meeting discusses the reorganization plans and takes decisions concerning the division of farm land&#13;
into independent parcels and the form of organization, such as joint stock companies, association of&#13;
peasant farms, collectives, cooperatives, or independent units.&#13;
2.4    Local initiatives by voluntarily created groups are being taken for the division and distribution&#13;
of agricultural lands of state and collective farms at the village level. For example, in the Salyan raion,&#13;
24 out of 27 farms have completed the following steps: (i) carried out a complete inventory and valuation&#13;
of movable and immovable properties of the farm including land assets; (ii) defined the eligibility criteria&#13;
for sharing of movable farm property among the members of the farm and the criteria for distribution&#13;
of land among the inhabitants of the village after reserving certain portions of the land for future&#13;
contingencies; and (iii) have decided and allocated the land to individual, family or groups of farmers on&#13;
the basis of lottery. The raion administration has issued temporary land ownership certificates to each&#13;
of the group leaders, family head or individual land parcel holder. The certificates indicate the area,&#13;
coordinates, boundary, land quality and locational details. The raion administration would replace the&#13;
temporary land certificate with a legally valid land certificate. These records will be maintained officially&#13;
by the State Land Committee. A similar situation exists in all the farms proposed for pilot development&#13;
under the project (para. 2.8).&#13;
2.5    While improvements are noticeable both in the quantities and qualities of vegetables, fruits and&#13;
livestock products, farms are unable to exploit the full potential of the available resources. This is&#13;
because a majority of the farm members have not yet been able, to claim individual ownership; to&#13;
voluntarily determine how to use their newly acquired land and non-land assets; and to reconstitute&#13;
themselves as individual farms, joint stock companies, holding companies, partnerships and lease holders&#13;
or other suitable forms. The guiding principles which would govern the process of farm restructuring&#13;
has been described in Box 2.2. Some of these principles are implicit in the present decision making&#13;
process for the restructuring of state and collective farms.&#13;
C. STATE AND COLLECTIVE FARMS TO BE PRIVATIZED AND RESTRUCTURED&#13;
2.6   In order to accelerate the process of land privatization and farm restructuring, to try alternative&#13;
supporting mechanisms and most importantly, to determine the levels of resources needed for farm&#13;
restructuring, five representative farms have been chosen in five raions of Barda, Lenkoran, Salyan,&#13;
1/     The Local Commission at farm or village level consists of the President of the Farm (Kolkhoz or Sovkhoz);&#13;
and the finance and accounts representative of the farm together with elected representatives of farm&#13;
workers; village administration; service section (teaching, health etc.); pensioners; and senior member of&#13;
the community "Aksakhal".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Udjar and Xachmaz (see Map IBRD No. 28120).&#13;
The main criteria used by the Government in                  2.2: Gdinglnpknfer Land&#13;

timely irrigation and total area                 restructing procesg.&#13;
ranging from 715 ha in Lenkoran&#13;
to 5400 ha in Xachmaz consisting&#13;
of medium and heavy soils. The&#13;
farms are serviced by public electricity and water services. The permanent labor force&#13;
on each of the farms range between 300 and 600 people. There are also significant&#13;
numbers of pensioners and other dependents reliant on each farm. Reflecting the agro-&#13;
ecological regions, production on Salyan, Udjar and Barda involves a rotation of cotton,&#13;
cereals and forage crops, Xachmaz has a range of fruit crops alongside cereals and&#13;
forage, and Lenkoran has fruits, vegetables, tea, cereals and forage crops. Most of the&#13;
farms operate livestock units with dairy cows of indigenous breeds, (although two farms&#13;
have herds of Freisan cows), some buffalo, and sheep;&#13;
(ii)    Farm Infrastructure.  Most of the main irrigation systems in the five project farms are&#13;
gravity irrigation fed, and some portions of the farms are equipped with pumping&#13;
facilities that supply water to irrigate higher lands or to raise the water pressure in the&#13;
closed pipes for sprinkler irrigation. All main canals and most of the secondary canals&#13;
were originally lined. The tertiary canals are mostly pre-cast reinforced concrete sections&#13;
or concrete lining cast in-situ. However unlined open earth canals or closed pipe systems&#13;
made of steel or cement pipes are found in more than 50 percent of the tertiary canal&#13;
systems in the project farms. Each farm has a range of production and administrative&#13;
buildings and a farm machinery park. The past legacy of centralized planning and severe&#13;
shortage of budgetary resources have resulted in dilapidated infrastructure, non-&#13;
functioning pipelines and blocked drainage systems. Inadequate maintenance, lack of&#13;
spare parts and centralized management have reduced the productive use of farm&#13;
machinery, affecting standards of soil cultivation and efficiency; and&#13;
(iii)    Private Allotments of Land. Each farm member in the project farms have retained their&#13;
traditional private plot, usually surrounding the house. The area of plots varies from 600&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sqm. in the densely populated raion of Lenkoran to about 1200 sqm in the less densely&#13;
populated raion of Udjar. The plots are used for producing a range of crops (especially&#13;
vegetables and fruit), raising small livestock, compost and storage. Most of these plots&#13;
are meticulously maintained and the quality of produce is better than on the collectively&#13;
managed farms.&#13;
D. STATUS OF PRIVATIZATION IN THE FIvE PROJECT FARMs&#13;
2.7    Significant progress was made in the second half of 1995 in initiating privatization on the project&#13;
farms. In all five locations, procedures are being followed as laid-down by the Government regulation&#13;
on privatization. There are, however, differences between farms in the precise arrangements and pace&#13;
of transition. Each of the five rayons has established a privatization commission with membership&#13;
including rayon-level specialists and farmers' representatives nominated by the intended farmers. A&#13;
technical committee on each farm was elected, in association with each commission, specifically to&#13;
undertake inventories and valuations of fixed and movable assets and to make recommendations to the&#13;
commission on mechanisms for dividing them between qualifying residents on the kolkhozes and&#13;
sovkhozes. In addition to this, at Barda, a "disputes" committee has been established, with membership&#13;
consisting of agricultural researchers, experienced farmers and legal specialists, to advise individuals or&#13;
groups of intended farmers on organizational, technical and legal questions.&#13;
2.8    Decisions have been made, discussed and accepted by the intended farmers on the distribution&#13;
of assets on all five project farms. For three farms in Barda, Udjar and Lenkoran, a land share has been&#13;
allocated to all persons of 18 years or over currently living on the kolkhozes. In Salyan, the qualifying&#13;
age is fourteen years and on Xachmaz all residents are shareholders, irrespective of age. The individual&#13;
land share-holdings vary: Barda 1.3 ha, Udjar 1.6 - 2.0 ha, Salyan 1.2 ha, Lenkoran 0.1 ha and Xachmaz&#13;
0.3 ha. In all cases, farm workers, pensioners, social workers (schools and health), disabled people and&#13;
off-farm workers (e.g., military) qualify as land shareholders.&#13;
2.9    Shareholders on all farms are free to exit with land rights and there is no control over prospective&#13;
buyers. Land and property within the villages is already being traded. The newly emerging farmers on&#13;
all five farms do not anticipate sale of farmland in the foreseeable future, because of its security value.&#13;
However, where necessary, there is provision for payments to be made in accordance with shares values&#13;
established by the Privatization Commission. Shares in the few farm buildings on two project farms&#13;
(Barda and Udjar) are being distributed amongst the personnel currently working in them.  On the&#13;
remaining farms, shares are divided between all members. In all cases it has been agreed that charges&#13;
will be levied on individual farmers that use of the buildings, e.g., farm produce stores. Machinery&#13;
shares in four of the project farms have been allocated to all shareholders; the exception is Barda where&#13;
the local commission agreed to provide the share to the workers directly involved. Livestock shares also&#13;
have been allocated either to the workers directly involved as in Barda or to all shareholders in the other&#13;
four project farms, where shares in livestock have been allocated to all members, shareholders will&#13;
generally receive annual dividends; in the case of Lenkoran the dividend is part of a monthly salary.&#13;
2.10   Organization of the newly privatized farms will inevitably change considerably in the coming&#13;
years. However, for the immediate future, a majority of new farmers have opted to create groups&#13;
(similar to working brigades in the previous system) and to cultivate their land in blocks. These are&#13;
organized on a village basis and their location is decided in accordance with proximity to the village&#13;
concerned. Precise land allocation within each block will be decided by lottery. Provisional certificates&#13;
to each shareholder are being issued. Group of farmers on most of the project farms took charge of the&#13;
land in late 1995 and, therefore, these kolkhozes/sovkhozes are, in effect already disbanded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
2.11   All groups clearly intend to continue present production patterns. Shareholders on three of the&#13;
five farms have agreed to maintain the existing machinery pools on all project farms as a single operation&#13;
and the groups mostly intend to contract with the privatized machinery pool (agro-service) for basic&#13;
cultivation work. The active labor force in each group is excessive for the most economical operation&#13;
of the blocks of land concerned and the new farmers have clearly accepted that profitable operation&#13;
depends on maximizing manual labor, e.g., for weeding and cotton picking. In the same way, the new&#13;
farmers are enthusiastic to participate in reconstruction work of the irrigation schemes. They also accept&#13;
their responsibilities for maintaining irrigation and drainage channels on their blocks of land and the&#13;
payment of water charges. Similarly, new farmers accept the need for and implications of obtaining&#13;
credit for initiating production on their farm blocks.&#13;
Prospects&#13;
2.12   The present production systems are physically and economically suited to the farms and with&#13;
rehabilitation, extension, and modernization of irrigation and drainage facilities, offer good potential as&#13;
profitable intensive farming enterprises. With improved macroeconomic conditions and the liberalized&#13;
price and trade regimes, the emerging farms would be able to operate as independent units, if they are&#13;
provided with working capital for seasonal inputs and investment in more efficient technologies. As&#13;
international experience has demonstrated, individual farms and enterprises have proven to be far more&#13;
efficient and productive than state and collective farms, especially in vegetable and livestock production.&#13;
This is evident from the factor productivity differentials in private plots and collective farms in project&#13;
areas.&#13;
E. KEY PROBLEMS FACED BY PROJECT FARMS&#13;
2.13   Other key problems confronting the farms are:&#13;
(i)    Deteriorated On-Farm and Inter-Farm Infrastructure. The irrigation systems in these&#13;
farms were built during 1966 and 1970s and due to lack of maintenance in recent years&#13;
have deteriorated. These were designed to serve large scale farms with cropping and&#13;
management for arable lands ranging in size from 700 to 4500 hectares. Off-farm&#13;
irrigation water conveyance efficiency is low (less than 50 percent) as the system has&#13;
deteriorated from lack of maintenance. The poor status of irrigation and drainage canals&#13;
is the major constraint to farm productivity and, without reconstruction, will further&#13;
erode farm profitability. Farm buildings and farm access roads also suffer from poor&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
(ii)    Obsolete Farm Machinery. The neglected state of most machines and equipment poses&#13;
a serious constraint for timely farm operations. Most of the farm machinery is outdated,&#13;
obsolete and in need of repairs and replacements;&#13;
(iii)   Lack of Credit and Input Availability. Most of the farms are facing liquidity constraints&#13;
and are not able to buy inputs. Most inputs such as nitrogenous and potash fertilizers,&#13;
pesticides, herbicides, seeds, farm machinery are imported; and&#13;
(iv)   Deterioration of Social Services and Quality of Life. Most of the farm population in the&#13;
five project farms could be classified as vulnerable, resulting from their inability to sell&#13;
their produce, unpaid salaries, and withdrawal of Government support. Most of the able&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
bodied working men have migrated to neighboring countries in search of better&#13;
employment opportunities. The farms are no longer able to provide social services such&#13;
as health facilities, child care, schooling, drinking water and sanitation facilities, etc,&#13;
which once belonged to the former state and collective farm operations. The removal of&#13;
explicit and implicit food subsidies and the elimination of bread subsidies in 1995 has&#13;
placed increased hardship, especially on non-working pensioners, women and children.&#13;
F. LESSONS FROM EXPERENCE FROM OTHER TRANSmON ECONOMIES&#13;
2.13   Experience in countries which are undergoing transition from a centrally planned to a market&#13;
economy has proved that land privatization and farm restructuring is best undertaken in a phased manner&#13;
consistent with the development of markets, functioning financial intermediaries and overall macro-&#13;
economic stabilization to yield desired results. The process is accelerated as the distortions in the&#13;
economy are eliminated, procedures refined, legal systems developed and supporting institutions evolve&#13;
to provide timely support services. Fundamental to this program is to give titles to farm land and&#13;
property in the hands of farm members - with an opportunity to voluntarily decide how to use these newly&#13;
acquired rights. Assistance programs should address the severe constraints faced by the privatized farms,&#13;
in particular: (i) the lack of appropriate information on re-organization laws and procedures; and&#13;
(ii) inadequate institutional capability to effect the transfer, limited technology choices, need for focused&#13;
social services, lack of working capital and investment funds for restructuring production systems&#13;
appropriate for private small-scale farming, and the poor state of irrigation and road infrastructure. The&#13;
proposed farm privatization project takes into consideration these factors and the components have been&#13;
designed to address the critical constraints identified from the lessons of experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1    The main objective of the Farm Privatization Project (FPP) is to accelerate the Government's&#13;
program for land privatization and farm restructuring of representative state and collective farms in a&#13;
systematic manner and to provide models which could serve as a basis for wider geographical&#13;
replicability. This objective would be achieved through the provision of: (i) essential support services&#13;
which are necessary to sustain privatized agriculture at the raion and farm levels. These are: land&#13;
registration, farm information and advisory services, credit services, and rehabilitation of critical&#13;
irrigation and drainage infrastructure; (ii) an enabling environment which would help build linkages&#13;
between key institutions, viz., Ministry of Agriculture, State Land Committee, State Irrigation&#13;
Committee, Agrarian Reform Commissions and agricultural banking institutions; and (iii) community&#13;
based social services and formation of village groups in support of land privatization and farm&#13;
restructuring.&#13;
3.2    The project activities are regional and farm specific in nature, and which have been designed to&#13;
be replicable. At the raion level, the project would support the land registration system, advisory&#13;
services, credit delivery mechanisms, and re-orientation of the department of agriculture functions to&#13;
service privatized farms. These support services would have the capability to service the needs of the&#13;
privatized farms throughout the participating raions and would form the basis for the subsequent&#13;
development of national systems. At the farm level, the project would develop a business oriented&#13;
outlook in the privatized farms by providing advisory and credit support to those activities which are&#13;
financially and economically viable; rehabilitate the main water supply works and field level irrigation&#13;
and drainage works, and initiate new concepts of field level water management through the formation of&#13;
water user's associations and implementation of cost recovery mechanisms. The project area consists of&#13;
representative state and collective farms chosen from the raions of Barda, Lenkoran, Salyan, Udjar,&#13;
Xachmaz and Sharur in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3    The project would consist of four components to be implemented over a period of five years.&#13;
These are: (i) Farm  Privatization Support Services at the national level and in the raions;&#13;
(ii) Rehabilitation of Main Irrigation Water Supply and Drainage Works; (iii) Community Development&#13;
Program; and (iv) Project Management and Implementation.&#13;
Farm Privatization Support Services (US$20.03 million)&#13;
3.4    The farm privatization support services consists of four sub-components: (i) Land Registration&#13;
Services; (ii) Farm Information and Advisory Services; (iii) Water User's Association (WUAs); and (iv)&#13;
Privatized Farm Credit Services.&#13;
3.5    Land Registration Services (US$2.32 million). This sub-component would enable the State&#13;
Land Committee in Baku and in the raions to systematically register new land parcels and issue land titles&#13;
to individuals, so that they can operate as independent farm units in a market-oriented environment. This&#13;
component would provide support in two critical areas: (a) Land Registration System; and (b) Land&#13;
Mapping and Surveying.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(a)    Land Registration System. The system will be based on parcels or units of land that&#13;
have been allocated in accordance with the land privatization process. It will operate on&#13;
personal computers and have the hardware and software security required to ensure that&#13;
the records are reliable, protect the interests of the new land owners and are secure. It&#13;
will be capable of linking land information to ownership, fixed assets, such as buildings,&#13;
store basic land use data and information required for land valuation. Its design would&#13;
permit it for future expansion to record all other interests associated with each parcel of&#13;
land, such as mortgages, leases, rights of access and servitudes. The central office of&#13;
State Land Committee and the land registration offices (LRO's) in the raions, where the&#13;
representative farms are located will be strengthened and appropriate training provided&#13;
to staff, so that they could provide the necessary land registration services required to&#13;
preserve and record the land rights of the emerging privatized farm units. Initially, the&#13;
LRO's would serve the needs of these representative state and collective farms and then,&#13;
support the privatization of farms within the raion by providing technical services for&#13;
land registration. This would result in legitimizing the presently used temporary land&#13;
certificates being issued by the raion administration and replacing it with official "State&#13;
Land Acts" (Land Registration Certificates). These would then constitute the legal&#13;
documents for the eventual purchase and sale of land, inheritance, gift, mortgaging,&#13;
leasing, subdivision and consolidation of land, once the land markets become operational.&#13;
The LROs would provide open access to their records and information, and a prescribed&#13;
schedule of fees would be implemented to sustain the system. The project would finance&#13;
field vehicles, office equipment, rehabilitation of offices and incremental operating costs,&#13;
technical assistance and training; and&#13;
(b)    Land Surveying and Mapping. Large tracts of land that will be subdivided and allocated&#13;
as part of the privatization process in each of the project farms will be delineated using&#13;
physical features, wherever possible. The existing 1:10,000 land cadastre maps produced&#13;
by the Land Institute will be used as a guideline. These boundaries will be verified in&#13;
the field as well. Land suitability information from the land cadastre maps will be&#13;
transferred on to the legal cadastre base maps, in order to more precisely calculate the&#13;
land share. Legal cadastral mapping at 1:2000 scale for villages and 1:5000 or 1:10,000&#13;
for the rural areas will be undertaken and all mapping, will be related to the national&#13;
mapping grid. It consists of the following activities:&#13;
(i)    Existing air photography that is less than five years old will be used to compile&#13;
initial legal cadastral base mapping of the project areas. Areas with photography&#13;
greater than five years old, or village areas where existing photography does not&#13;
meet the accuracy requirements for 1:2,000 mapping, will require new&#13;
photography. If new photography is required, it will be necessary that this&#13;
photography be flown under "leaf-free" conditions so as not to obscure ground&#13;
features;&#13;
(ii)    Existing geodetic survey control within the project area will be densified using&#13;
GPS, as required, to support photogrammetric mapping;&#13;
(iii)   Kolkhoz, sovkhoz and village boundaries will be surveyed using GPS or ground&#13;
survey techniques;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(iv)    Legal cadastral base maps will be compiled photogrammetically with as much&#13;
information transferred from existing topographic mapping as possible. The legal&#13;
cadastre maps will include basic planimetric features such as roads, buildings,&#13;
rivers, lakes, etc. Existing physical features visible on the photography that&#13;
define property boundaries such as fences, hedges, tree lines, irrigation ditches&#13;
etc. will be mapped. It is anticipated that most household and garden plots&#13;
within village limits will be determined photogrammetically using existing&#13;
features. It will, however, be necessary to verify these features in the field;&#13;
(v)    Based upon the land allocation and registration procedures described in Text Box&#13;
2.1, individual land parcels will be planned, allocated and drawn on the legal&#13;
cadastre base maps;&#13;
(vi)   These parcels will then be demarcated in the field using temporary markers such&#13;
as wooden stakes, and surveyed. At the same time, all other information on the&#13;
legal cadastre base maps will be verified and any necessary measurements will&#13;
be taken; and&#13;
(vii)   The legal cadastre base maps will be updated with field information, linked to&#13;
land ownership information and individual plot plans and State acts will be&#13;
prepared for approval, and issued to landowners.&#13;
3.6    Farm Information and Advisory Services (US$2.81 million). This component would support&#13;
the establishment of Farm Development Centers at the Ministry of Agriculture in Baku and in the&#13;
Department of Agriculture (Agrokombinats) in each of the project raions. The project will finance the&#13;
rehabilitation of offices, equipment, vehicles, communication materials, training of staff, technical&#13;
assistance and operating costs. These centers would provide two broad types of services: (a) information&#13;
services; and (b) advisory services for land privatization and farm restructuring.&#13;
(a)    Information Services. Two types of information will be provided: (i) General: such as&#13;
information on the privatization process; land reform laws; how to start new business,&#13;
keep simple accounts, how to make business plans, etc; and (ii) Raion specific: such as&#13;
information on local market conditions of farm inputs and outputs, agronomic practices,&#13;
environmental matters, methods to reduce harvest losses, etc. All information generated&#13;
by these centers would be provided free of charge, as a public good.  Periodic&#13;
information campaigns would be undertaken through the mass media; and&#13;
(b)    Advisory Services. The advisory services would focus on assisting the representative&#13;
state and collective farms to go through the land privatization and restructuring process.&#13;
Advisory services on land privatization will focus on: providing assistance to state and&#13;
collective farms to go through the land privatization process in accordance with the&#13;
guiding principles for farm privatization set out in Chapter 2; assisting the state and&#13;
collective farm employees to understand and follow the procedures for obtaining land,&#13;
clear titles to land and registration of the state acts to ensure protection of property rights.&#13;
Advisory services on farm restructuring will focus on providing assistance to state and&#13;
collective farms to: (i) to evaluate various types of re-organization options, such as&#13;
individual farm units, cooperatives, joint stock companies, association of private farms,&#13;
service organizations, etc; (ii) to evaluate alternative business plans for crops and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
livestock activities; (iii) to prepare applications for obtaining the term loan from&#13;
Agroprombank under the project; (iv) to enable the new farm units to procure essential&#13;
farm inputs from inputs and develop linkages with the Agricultural Academy at Ganj a for&#13;
technical back-stopping and technical research support; (v) to prepare detailed designs for&#13;
on-farm irrigation and drainage works and farm access roads; and (vi) to develop a&#13;
program for the divestiture of social assets and assisting in the transfer to local&#13;
administration or private operators.&#13;
3.7    Water Users' Association (WUA's) (US$1.46 million). The emergence of the private farmers&#13;
provides an opportunity to assume the responsibility for the overall water management of their respective&#13;
farms. In this regard, the project farmers would be organized into specialized WUA's, as in many other&#13;
countries, for water management. The main objectives of the WUA's are: (i) to provide equitable,&#13;
efficient and timely distribution of irrigation water at the field level; and (ii) mobilize and train farmers&#13;
to form groups and take responsibility for operation, maintenance, cost recovery and management of&#13;
water resources.  The Water Users' Association would be formed through a participatory process&#13;
approach in each of the project farms. The membership of the association may be either individual&#13;
persons or juridical entities owning land located in the territory of the Association. The process and&#13;
approaches would be revised, adjusted and improved based on the lessons learned from the on-going&#13;
implementation experiences. The WUA's would be formed as private juridical self supporting,&#13;
independent entities for the operation, maintenance and management of irrigation and drainage systems.&#13;
A water user group (WUG) would be formed for each hydrologic unit, a tertiary bloc, representing 10&#13;
to 15 farmers. These groups would be established through dialogue and consent of the beneficiaries,&#13;
The WUA's would follow the establishment of WUG's on the basis of the command area of a secondary&#13;
and/or main canal and would require the agreement of at least 80 percent of the respective WUG 's under&#13;
each secondary or main canal. The WUA's would have three main functions: (i) operation and&#13;
maintenance of the irrigation and drainage systems; (ii) collection of water charges; and (iii) resolution&#13;
of conflicts amnong its members, arising out of water allocation and use. The rehabilitation of field level&#13;
irrigation and drainage works would be planned and implemented in consultation with the water users.&#13;
The rehabilitation works would be designed and carried out with the active participation of the water user&#13;
groups. The project would assist the private farms to organize into cohesive groups, provide technical&#13;
support and guidance to WUA's. At the raion level, field agents would be deployed - at least one per&#13;
village - to promote the formation of WUA's and to serve as a contact point for the delivery of the&#13;
component support and services. The project would finance office equipment, vehicles, training in&#13;
communication skills, farmer training, regulations of WUA's and water management techniques.&#13;
Technical assistance of a WUA specialist and legal aspects and operating costs.&#13;
3.8    Privatized Farn Credit Services (US$13.44 million). The main objective of this sub-component&#13;
would be to provide credit services to the emerging private farms to enable them to operate as&#13;
independent units in a market enviromnent. The project would use Agroprombank on an agency basis&#13;
for channelling seasonal and long term investments to privatized farm units emerging from the&#13;
privatization process. A preliminary financial review of APBZ' undertaken during project preparaation&#13;
found it to be suitable as an agency bank, if appropriate training and institutional support is provided to&#13;
allow the existing staff, who are knowledgeable about agriculture, to undertake the necessary credit&#13;
2/    It recommends a full financial audit, restructuring and recapitalization of APB, separation of commercial&#13;
lending from directed credit, staff training and development and modernization of accounting systems and&#13;
procedures. The Institution Building and Technical Assistance (IBTA) project of the World Bank together&#13;
with UNDP, is in the process of undertaking a complete review of the Agroprombank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
analysis for lending in a market economy. The Bank's financial sector review (May 22, 1996) concludes&#13;
that APB is currently the only agricultural bank which has the capacity to do agricultural financing, but&#13;
limit its lending only to those that are current in both interest and principal and require collateral. In the&#13;
medium term, the sector review recommends the privatization of the APB. The project would provide:&#13;
(a)    Institutional Support consisting of training of a limited number of staff, provision of the&#13;
most essential equipment and operational supplies at the Headquarters and in the project&#13;
raions, in order to service the credit needs of the privatized farm units; and&#13;
(b)    Credit. Provision of credit for seasonal working capital, medium  and long-term&#13;
investment credit for farm units in the project raions to enable them to operate&#13;
independently and commercially. The major investment categories are expected to be:&#13;
(i)    Farm Machinery and Eguipment including tractors and ancillary machinery and&#13;
equipment, milking and cooling devices, critical spare parts for various types of&#13;
existing farm machinery, storage and small scale processing units to suit the&#13;
needs of individual farms, private farm groups and associations;&#13;
(ii)    Farm  Buildings and Other Construction Works such as rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of livestock sheds, grain storage sheds, fencing, watering&#13;
facilities, marketing centers;&#13;
(iii)   Seasonal Working Capital for the purchase of seasonal farm inputs, such as&#13;
seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, labor, fuel, machinery services and transport;&#13;
(iv)   Field Level Irrigation and Drainage Works. Field level works consists mostly of&#13;
land levelling and provision of water supply and drainage ditches. The density&#13;
of the field ditches would vary with the nature and cropping pattern of individual&#13;
farm units. Land levelling operation will also vary from unit to unit depending&#13;
upon the topography of land and density of field irrigation and drainage design&#13;
adopted for cropping pattern intended by individual land owner. The program&#13;
of on-farm improvement would include support for enhancing irrigation&#13;
application efficiencies and offer opportunities for investment in drainage&#13;
facilities to mitigate, cure or prevent problem of salinization. It is estimated that&#13;
the water supply field ditches of cross section 1.0 M2 with a density of 100 m to&#13;
120 m/ha will be constructed and land levelling operation will consist of earth&#13;
cutting and filling which will be within the limit of 800 M3/ha. An attempt to&#13;
introduce, where feasible, new technology for field drains with pre-wrapped PVC&#13;
pipes to substitute for the use of expensive gravel filter;&#13;
(v)    Sprinkler/Bubble Irrigation Systems will be introduced on a pilot scale to&#13;
demonstrate its technical feasibility for vegetable and fruits production. In&#13;
particular the irrigation water management of more intensive high value crop mix&#13;
with appropriate irrigation water conservation technology to overcome production&#13;
constraints with the adoption of low pressure sprinkler, drip, bubbler, micro-jet&#13;
etc., will be demonstrated over an area of 10 ha in Yergouz farm of Xachmaz&#13;
raion and in about 20 ha in Narimanov farm in Lenkoran; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(vi)   Community Development Activities. These are expected to be rehabilitation of&#13;
domestic water supply systems, provision of fuel/fodder trees; small scale&#13;
activities such as sericulture, apiculture, carpet weaving, silk reeling, sewing,&#13;
weaving, poultry, etc.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Main Irrigation Water Supply and Drainage Works in Project Farms (US$5.52&#13;
million)&#13;
3.9    The following six broad categories of rehabilitation works for the main irrigation water supply&#13;
would be carried out:&#13;
(a)    Desiltation of Open Canals and Drains. Cleaning and desilting of about 500 km of main,&#13;
secondary and tertiary irrigation canals and 245 km of collectors and field drains would&#13;
be undertaken;&#13;
(b)    Repairs and Reconstruction of Existing Structures. Most of the irrigation structures on&#13;
all the project farms are totally defunct and in need of complete reconstruction. This&#13;
would involve the reconstruction of 330 water control structures and 320 tertiary outlets;&#13;
(c)    Rehabilitation of Hydrant Systems. The Narimanov farm in Lenkoran raion and Yergouz&#13;
farm in Xachmaz are served by a system of pressurized irrigation system with&#13;
underground pipelines equipped with hydrants. These are only partly functional. The&#13;
project would repair and re-operationalize about 80 km of underground pipelines,&#13;
replace/repair about 220 hydrants and reconstruct three pipeline intake structures on the&#13;
Yergouz farm;&#13;
(d)    Rehabilitation of Sub-surface Drainage Systems. This would consist of: (a) cleaning and&#13;
repairing, where necessary, the sub-surface drainage pipelines of about 150 km; (b)&#13;
repair the existing 480 drainage pumps (control pits and junctions); and (c) construction&#13;
of 80 new drainage sumps in Gulaband-Hatai farm;&#13;
(e)    Construction of New Canals. The splitting of the state farms would result in increasing&#13;
the density of the tertiary canal network. The present spacing in Ghiliinjili is 500 and&#13;
in Gulaband-Hatai is 1000 meters. In preparation for the sub-division of land, the density&#13;
would be increased by spacing of 250 meters, which would require 30 km of new tertiary&#13;
canals in Ghiliinjili and 60 km on Gulaband-Hatai; and&#13;
(f)    Construction of New Irrigation Structures. This would consist of: (a) Construction of&#13;
90 tertiary intakes; (b) 80 canal regulators; (c) 430 tertiary outlets; (d) construction of&#13;
a weir on the Dizdaru river to improve the water intake to Narimanov farm; (e) two&#13;
storage reservoirs - one on Narimanov and the other on Yergouz; and (f) the installation&#13;
of a pumping unit to lift water for about 300 ha in Yergouz farm.&#13;
Community Development Program (US$1.04 million)&#13;
3.10   This component would provide support for the development of people based community&#13;
development activities; establishment of business centers and preparation of a broader social development&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(a)    Participatory Approaches. Participatory approaches would be developed to implement&#13;
the guiding principles presented in Text Box 2.2; to ensure equity in the land distribution&#13;
and farm restructuring process and so that equal opportunity is provided to all persons&#13;
to actively participate in the agricultural transformation process.  This would be&#13;
undertaken through the training of community development workers and wide-spread&#13;
education and awareness raising campaign using different mass media;&#13;
(b)    Establishment of Business Centers. This sub-component would support: (a) the&#13;
establishment of functioning business centers with the ability to provide potential&#13;
entrepreneurs with technical, financial and managerial advice; (b) create an initial core&#13;
of trained entrepreneurs in different fields; and (c) promote small-scale off-farm&#13;
businesses in the project areas. Business centers would be opened in the project raions,&#13;
but operating on either a full time or part time basis, depending on the circumstances&#13;
prevailing in each raion. These centers would provide business advice and information&#13;
facilities; technical and managerial training and credit for new enterprises. Typical&#13;
activities which could merit support are carpet making, knitting and sewing, milk&#13;
processing, flour mills, fish, and small scale food processing activities; and&#13;
(c)    Preparation of a Broader Social Development Project. The project would provide&#13;
support for the preparation of a larger social development project taking into account the&#13;
lessons learnt from the participatory approaches.&#13;
Project Management and Implementation (US$2.23 million)&#13;
3.11   The project would support the establishment of: (a) a project management unit in the Cabinet of&#13;
Ministers at the Federal level in Baku; and (b) Project Implementation Units in each of the project raions.&#13;
The detailed functions and responsibilities have been elaborated in Chapter IV. The project would&#13;
provide support for technical assistance, training, study tours, equipment and supplies, operating costs,&#13;
conmmunication facilities, utilities, vehicles and rehabilitation of offices.&#13;
Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
3.12   The success of the project depends on the timely availability of trained manpower to undertake&#13;
various activities envisaged in the project. The main objective of the training would be to provide&#13;
relevant technical, managerial, financial skills to a large number of personnel who would be responsible&#13;
for the implementation of the project. The project requires new types of skills and experience as many&#13;
of the project activities require new approaches, that are quite different from those now being practiced&#13;
in Azerbaijan. It is envisaged that a large number of persons drawn from different ministries, agencies&#13;
departments from the participating raions and from the project farms would benefit from training.&#13;
3.13   Training. Training for the project would be spread over five years and would be developed in&#13;
consultation with the various institutions involved in the project. It would support in-country and foreign&#13;
training. The duration of training ranges from short courses to five day workshops, to extended programs&#13;
of one month or even longer. The in-country training would focus on various aspects of farm&#13;
privatization; water management techniques; farm information development and dissemination; farm&#13;
business planning and various aspects of land registration. The foreign training would focus on land&#13;
registration processes and procedures in market economies, organization and operational aspects of water&#13;
user's associations, farm information and advisory services, finance and accounting aspects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
3.14   Technical Assistance. The objective of technical assistance would be to provide specialized&#13;
assistance in a variety of skill areas needed for the effective implementation of the proposed project&#13;
components. The technical assistance package has been developed in close consultation with the various&#13;
institutions involved in the project. The main emphasis is to provide the most critical skills that are not&#13;
presently available in the country and transfer these skills to the Azeri counterparts. The technical&#13;
assistance delivery will be carried out in two ways: (i) long term individual or multi-disciplinary task&#13;
oriented services from one to two years; and (ii) short term individual or firm services for six months&#13;
or less.&#13;
(a)    Long Term Services (6 months to two years). The long term services would be in the&#13;
areas of: (i) rural credit specialist; (ii) agri-business specialist; (iii) farm re-structuring&#13;
specialist; (iv) procurement specialist; and (v) services of a Non-Governmental&#13;
Organization; and&#13;
(b)    Short Term Services (less than 6 months). The short term services will be in the areas&#13;
of: (i) land legislation: to assist in the review and modifications of the draft land law,&#13;
amendments to the land code, law on easements or servitudes, or amendments to draft&#13;
land reform law; (ii) land cadastre and mapping specialists; (iii) computer systems&#13;
specialists; (iv) irrigation engineering; (v) farm information and advisory services; (vi)&#13;
selected technical areas of crop, fruit and vegetable and livestock production; and (vii)&#13;
accounting and auditing.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.15   The project is estimated to cost US$28.82 million, based on October 1996 prices. The cost of&#13;
various components and sub-components have been summarized in Table 3.1. Detailed project costs have&#13;
been provided in Annex H. The foreign exchange component has been estimated at US$21.21 million&#13;
or 72 percent of the total cost. This cost includes physical and price contingencies of US$3.14 million&#13;
(13 percent of base cost, but excludes duties and taxes, as the goods and services to be procured under&#13;
this project would be exempted). Physical contingencies vary from 0 percent to 20 percent depending&#13;
on the items. Local costs have been converted to their US$ equivalent using the projected annual average&#13;
exchange rates of 4302, 4412, 4335, 4295, and 4207 manats to US$1 from 1997 to 2001. Price&#13;
contingency estimates assume an increase in local currency costs of 17.5, 5.6, 1.2, 2.1 and 0.9 percent&#13;
per year from 1997 to 2001 (which is the projected GDP deflator) and 2.7, 2.5, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 percent&#13;
from 1997 to 2001 for foreign currency costs.&#13;

D. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
Source of Finance&#13;
3.16   The project will be financed by an IDA credit, an IFAD loan and by the Government of&#13;
Azerbaijan and participating privatized farms. IDA's contribution is US$14.7 million and IFAD will co-&#13;
finance US$9.3 million of project costs. Funds from IDA would be used to finance, in part, the goods,&#13;
works and services required for project management and implementation, land registration services, farm&#13;
information and advisory services, privatized farm credit services, rehabilitation of main irrigation and&#13;
drainage works for the farms in Salyan, Xachmas, Barda and Lenkoran. IFAD funds would be used to&#13;
finance, in part, the works, goods and services for Water Users' Association; community development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
activities, rehabilitation of the main irrigation water supply and drainage works for the farm in Udjar&#13;
raion, and seasonal loans. Table 3.2 provides details of financing for each component and source. Given&#13;
the fiscal difficulties of the state and raion administrations and lack of financial resources in the farms,&#13;
IDA credit and IFAD loan will finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs and a portion of local&#13;
costs. This would result in an IDA/IFAD contribution of about 83 percent of the project costs, and the&#13;
remainder 17 percent would be financed by the Government and participating farms/enterprises.&#13;
Agreement was reached during negotiations on the project financing plan; budgetary provisions and&#13;
allocation of counterpart funds, and provision of counterpart funds in the project account prior to credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;

3.17   Project Preparation Facility: A project preparation facility is in place for US$900,000. This is&#13;
being used to finance: (i) the procurement of essential equipment for strengthening land registration&#13;
services, vehicles, office equipment, computers and related accessories, operating materials, project&#13;
management unit and project implementation units at the raion levels; and (ii) obtain the services of short&#13;

3.18   The IDA Credit and IFAD Loan would be channelled through two mechanisms: (i) through the&#13;
Agroprombank, which will act as an agent bank for working capital, medium and long term investments&#13;
and community development activities; and (ii) through the Government fiscal channels to finance&#13;
institutional development activities, critical infrastructure support services, technical assistance, training&#13;
and project related studies. (See Figure 3.1 which describes the flow of funds from IDA/IFAD). During&#13;
negotiations, an assurance from the Government was obtained that the signing of the IFAD Loan&#13;
agreement would be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;

3.19   Agroprombank (APB) as an Agent Bank. APB was reviewed during the appraisal mission as&#13;
an intermediary for the proposed Farm Privatization Project. APB has a wide network of branches&#13;
covering all the raions including the location of the five project farms. Its staff has considerable&#13;
experience in lending to state owned agro-industries and farms. In light of the above, Agroprombank&#13;
would be used for on-lending IDA credit and IFAD funds on agency basis, that is, without taking the&#13;
financial and credit risk - which will remain with the Government. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
obtained on the Subsidiary Financing Agency Agreement. between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and&#13;
Agroprombank., eligibility and financing criteria, on-lending arrangements for sub-borrowers and the&#13;
provision to extend project support to any farm willing to undertake the agreed privatization process. The&#13;
execution of this agreement would be a condition of effectiveness. This agreement and the financial&#13;
situation of the Agroprombank will be reviewed in mid 1998 with a view to make appropriate&#13;
modifications at that time, including the consideration of making a restructured Agroprombank to take&#13;
the credit risk. APB will open a revolving fund for re-lending the proceeds of sub-loan repayments,&#13;
which would be limited to principal, with the interest payments from the beneficiaries being made to the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, which would be used to service the IDA credit. The raion level implementation unit,&#13;
consisting of representatives of the State Land Committee, State Irrigation Committee, Department of&#13;
Agriculture, Water User Association, local APB branch and credit advisors would be responsible for&#13;
approving sub-loans, thereby avoiding any unilateral decisions by APB, and they would have the authority&#13;
to approve the sub-loans of upto US$30,000. Sub-loans amounting to US$30,000 and above would need&#13;
the approval of the State Commission for Farm Privatization, which would be charged with the&#13;
responsibility of monitoring APB's performance on the basis of semi-annual reports submitted by APB.&#13;
APB will be strengthened in accounting and management information systems, training for staff and&#13;
technical assistance; and provided with computers and related accessories, office equipment, and vehicles.&#13;
The technical assistance will be used to hire two international experts, an agricultural credit specialist and&#13;
an accounting and financial systems specialist for one year to train staff and develop systems and&#13;
procedures. It was agreed during negotiations that the Ministry of Finance will provide to Agroprombank&#13;
an amount of not more than US$500, 000 from the IDA credit for a period of 10 years at an interest rate&#13;
of 0. 75 percent and 5 years grace for this purpose. These activities are expected to result in a core of&#13;
well trained staff and the introduction of a modern accounting and banking practices in the headquarters&#13;
and in the APB branches of the project raions. These arrangements are interim measures designed to&#13;
support the urgent needs for farm restructuring; a longer term strategy for the financial sector and APB&#13;
is being worked out in the context of the discussions of the Bank's financial sector report (No. 5422 dated&#13;
May 22, 1996) and a possible future Structural Adjustment Credit.&#13;
3.20   Rural Credit Cooperatives. Rural credit cooperatives remains an alternative option for on-&#13;
lending of project funds. The establishment of such an operation is being considered in Salyan raion,&#13;
with the assistance of EC-TACIS. The project would consider the possibility of on-lending part of the&#13;
proceeds through such cooperatives, following a review of their charter and operations during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.21   Government Fiscal Channels. The Government fiscal channels would be used to finance critical&#13;
infrastructure support services, technical assistance, training and project related studies and would be&#13;
administered by the State Government and provided to the raions. The raion level Project Implementation&#13;
Units (PIU's) would prepare the annual work plan and budget for investments in critical infrastructure,&#13;
such as main irrigation and drainage canals, farm access roads, etc. These will be reviewed by the State&#13;
Commission for Farm Privatization which would be responsible for giving approval for the annual work&#13;
plan and budget.&#13;

E. ON-LENDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#13;
3.22   The terms and conditions for the subsidiary loan agreement between the Agroprombank and the&#13;
privatized farming units or associations thereof would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    Terns of On-lending for Sub-loans. Agroprombank will on-lend IDA and IFAD funds&#13;
to eligible beneficiaries as defined in sub-para 3.22 (ii) for maturities varying from one&#13;
to ten years. The sub-loans would be denominated in Manats and the interest rate charged&#13;
would be the twelve month manat rate set by the National Bank. The Agroprombank will&#13;
charge a 2 percent loan appraisal fee and also receive an annual commission of upto 2&#13;
percent to be collected from interest paid by borrowers in cash on an arrears basis, based&#13;
on loan recovery performance. The on-lending terms will be reviewed periodically and&#13;
modified by agreement between IDA/IFAD and the Government, as necessary, to ensure&#13;
that they continue to reflect the market rates, and the fees to APB are linked to its&#13;
performance;&#13;
(b)    Loan  Beneficiaries.   Sub-loans&#13;
from  the Agroprombank will be          Box3.1 Eligbi 0    Cir Pfo   r Obining&#13;

(c)    Loan Ceilings: Loan ceilings per&#13;
eligible borrower would be placed&#13;
for the following categories of borrowings: (i) Seasonal working capital up to a maximum&#13;
of US$500 per hectare; (ii) Farm machinery, equipment and small scale processing units&#13;
- up to a maximum of US$30,000; (iii) Land improvements and field level infrastructure&#13;
works - up to a maximum of US$1500 per hectare; and (iv) community development&#13;
activities - upto a maximum of US$1000 per eligible comrnunity development activity.&#13;
Any deviations from these loan ceilings will have to be cleared by IDA/IFAD.&#13;
Agreement was reached during negotiations on loan ceilings on sub-loans to prevent&#13;
concentration in large land holdings and to ensure effective utilization of grants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.23   Loans will be made by Agroprombank and only for the following four broad types of&#13;
transactions:&#13;
(a)    Working Capital Requirements. Up to 90 percent of the capital required for one to three&#13;
year period and grace period ranging from six months to one year. A working capital&#13;
credit ceiling will be determined depending upon the needs of the crop/livestock/small&#13;
business activity to be undertaken;&#13;
(b)    Farm Machinery, Equipment and Small-scale Processing Units. Up to 90 percent of&#13;
the investment required for a term of 7 years with a two year grace period. The loan&#13;
approvals would be determined on the basis of business plans, eligibility criteria as&#13;
indicated in Text Box 3.1 and economic and financial viability;&#13;
(c)    Land Improvements/On-farm Infrastructure Works.  A one time grant of up to 25&#13;
percent of the investment required would be provided. The remaining 75 percent of the&#13;
investment required for land improvement/on-farm infrastructure works would be&#13;
provided for up to a term of 10 years with a five year grace period and would depend&#13;
upon the collateral arrangements and the repayment capability of the borrowers; and&#13;
(d)    Community Development Activities. Working capital loans of up to 90 percent of the&#13;
capital required for one to three years and a one-time capital grant of up to 50 percent&#13;
of the total capital required for commercially viable activities and the remaining balance&#13;
of 50 percent will be provided as a term credit to the beneficiaries.&#13;
F. COST RECOVERY&#13;
3.24   The Government has a provision for cost recovery for publicly funded irrigation and drainage&#13;
works. Presently, the farms are charged an annual water charge, based on calculations of water use and&#13;
this has little or no relationship to cost recovery of irrigation investments and operation and maintenance&#13;
costs. The parliament has passed the Irrigation and Amelioration Law, (June 5, 1996), which provides&#13;
for the establishment of Water Users Associations, cost recovery mechanisms and operation and&#13;
maintenance at the farm level. This law has been signed by the President. Under the project, the&#13;
following charges would be applied: (a) a betterment levy on all works associated with all off-farm&#13;
infrastructure improvement so as to recover about 50 percent of costs; and (b) water charges to recover&#13;
100 percent of the operation and maintenance of irrigation and drainage works.&#13;
3.25   The one-time capital grants channelled through APB amount to US$600,000 over five years for&#13;
on-farm works and community development activities. These grants are necessary to allow the project&#13;
farms to initiate on-farm works essential for start up, for which in the initial period, they cannot afford&#13;
to borrow. Community development grants are necessary because they are targeted at the most&#13;
vulnerable groups, with little or no marketable skills or assets. This grant will not constitute a serious&#13;
drain on the Government budget. At the end of the three year period, the Government will evaluate the&#13;
benefits and replicability of the grant program.&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   Successful implementation of all project components requires people with different skills and&#13;
functions to work together to achieve mutually agreed goals to meet the needs of the newly emerging&#13;
privatized farms. This will require effective and timely coordination of principally the staff of the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture, State Land Committee, State Irrigation Committee, State Property Committee,&#13;
Agroprombank and the farm members undergoing the privatization process. The project organization and&#13;
management would consist of the State Commission for Farm Privatization and Project Management Unit&#13;
at the National level and Project Implementation Units at the Raion level. The Organization and&#13;
Management chart is shown in Figure 4.1.&#13;
National Level&#13;
4.2   State Commission for Farm Privatization: Since the project requires inter-ministerial and inter-&#13;
agency co-operation, a state commission for farm privatization has been set up to perform this function,&#13;
and a Presidential decree has been issued. (Presidential decree No. 495 dated September 19,1996). This&#13;
commission is chaired by the First Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of Agrarian Reform&#13;
Commission, with the Minister of Agriculture as the Deputy Chairman, and members drawn from the&#13;
President's Administration, Agro-industrial Department of the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministry of Finance,&#13;
Justice, State Land Committee, State Irrigation Committee, State Veterinary Committee, State Property&#13;
Committee, Agroprombank, Cabinet of Ministers from Nakhichevan Republic and Raion administrators&#13;
from Barda, Lenkoran, Salyan, Udjar and Xachmaz. The commission would provide national policy&#13;
guidance, and co-ordinate various project activities needed for implementation. The commission has&#13;
endorsed the first year work plan and budget for the implementation of the project and this was agreed&#13;
during negotiations.&#13;
4.3   Project Management Unit (PMU): The day to day implementation of the project will be carried&#13;
out by the PMU. It is headed by a director assisted by a deputy director and a few specialists drawn&#13;
from the MOA, SLC, SIC, and other areas as required. The director of the PMU will report to the&#13;
Deputy Prime Minister of Agriculture and work in close coordination with the Minister for Agriculture.&#13;
Its main functions will be: (i) to provide overall guidance and assist each Project Implementation Unit&#13;
in the preparation, design and implementation of the project; (ii) carry out all work related to&#13;
procurement, disbursement, audit, reporting and monitoring of progress. Initially, in the first and second&#13;
year of project implementation, the Project Management Unit is expected to play a significant role in the&#13;
implementation of the project at the raion level.&#13;
Raion Level&#13;
4.4   Project Implementation Units (PIUs): The PIU's will be responsible for the implementation of&#13;
the project in the raions. It would consist of members drawn from the Agrokombinat, raion level SIC,&#13;
SLC, APB branch, WUA chairman and representatives from the farm. They will jointly develop the&#13;
farm level privatization program and the agreed work plan and budget would be sent to the State&#13;
Conmmission for Farm Privatization for review and approval. The raion administrator will be in charge&#13;
for overall project management at the raion level. The PMUIPIU would be assisted by short-term&#13;

consultants. It was agreed during negotiations that the Government would appoint qualified staff and&#13;
provide them with an incentive system linked to performance for PMU and in the project implementation&#13;
units. The roles, responsibilities and functions of the various institutions/agencies at the state and raion&#13;
levels involved in the implementation of the project have been described in Annex A-1.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
4.5    The farm privatization sub-components will be implemented in two overlapping operations. The&#13;
first operation would consist of activities required for the privatization of land and preparing it for farm&#13;
restructuring to take place in the project farms. The second operation would consist of investment&#13;
activities to enable the privatized farm units resulting from the restructuring process to operate as&#13;
independent units in a market economy. During negotiations, agreement was reached that land&#13;
privatization and farm restructuring process would be carried out in accordance with the guiding&#13;
principles described in Text Box 2.2, which are in accordance with the Law on Land Reform (Law No.&#13;
166 dated July 16, 1996) and Law on Kolkhoz and Sovkhoz Reform (Law No. 978 dated February 18,&#13;
1995).&#13;
First: The activities to be carried out during the first operation are:&#13;
(i)    Technical and administrative processes for providing certificates and titles for the&#13;
privatized farm units on each farm, so that they can operate as independent units/&#13;
enterprises in a market economy;&#13;
(ii)    Complete the rehabilitation of water distribution structures, desilting and cleaning of&#13;
canals, drainage and sub-surface drainage systems and field level improvements and&#13;
irrigation layouts for the project farms;&#13;
(iii)   Create legally registered water users associations;&#13;
(iv)   Complete the training of the staff of Project Management Unit, Project Implementation&#13;
Units at the raion levels, Agroprombank, State Land Committee and the farm&#13;
development units both in Baku and in the project raions; and&#13;
(v)    Initiate the process of preparing business plans for private farm units for evaluation by&#13;
Agroprombank.&#13;
Second: The activities to be carried out in the second stage are:&#13;
(i)    Establish privately operated agricultural input supply service centers for fertilizers,&#13;
pesticides, machinery services, processing and marketing services for the privatized farm&#13;
units emerging out of the restructuring process;&#13;
(ii)    Continue the training of staff of PMU, PIU's, Agroprombank, SLC and Farm&#13;
Development Units in Baku and in project raions;&#13;
(iii)   Evaluate business plans and process loan applications for working capital, on-farm&#13;
investments, input and machinery services, processing and marketing activities, etc. and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
(iii)   Obtain approval of the sub-loans from the raion level implementation unit for loans upto&#13;
US$30,000 and from the State Commission for Farm Privatization for loans above&#13;
US$30,000.&#13;
Implementation of Farm Privatization Support Services&#13;
4.6    Land Registration Services: The successful implementation of the land registration services will&#13;
require a multi-disciplinary team of specialists in geodesy, agricultural land use, land registration and law.&#13;
A central registration support unit would be established at Baku in the offices of SLC and the registration&#13;
offices at each of the project raions will be strengthened. The central unit would consist of specialists&#13;
drawn from the State Land Committee, State Land Use Organization and Project Institute (SLUOP), State&#13;
Committee on Geodesy and Cartography (SCGC) and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). During the initial&#13;
period of project implementation, the central unit is expected to play an important role in the management&#13;
and implementation of the registration services in the project farms. During this period, the raion level&#13;
officials would be trained in new methods and techniques that can subsequently be replicated to other&#13;
farms. These functions would be carried out by the state committee for geodesy and cartography and&#13;
land institute, consisting of specialists in geodesy, survey and agricultural land use, acting as registration&#13;
support units. They will provide support in the following areas:&#13;
(a)    Development of standardized procedures and methodologies for adoption of aerial&#13;
photographs, ground surveying, demarcation of land features and updating of maps to&#13;
function as a registration support unit;&#13;
(b)    Specialized support services such as photogrammetric mapping and land surveys; and&#13;
(c)    Training support to rayon SLC and LI zonal offices in the use of computers, total station&#13;
surveying and other specialized equipment.&#13;
4.7    Farm Information and Advisory Services. The successful implementation of farm information&#13;
and advisory services would require a multi-disciplinary team of specialists in agriculture, livestock, farm&#13;
management, irrigation, economics, finance and law. The farm development unit (FDU) in the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture in Baku and in the Department of Agriculture (Agrokombinat) in each of the project raions&#13;
would be responsible for the implementation of the farm information and advisory services. Since the&#13;
process of farm privatization requires involvement and support of multiple agencies, the staff will be&#13;
selected from the existing personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture (Baku) and the Agrokombinats in&#13;
the raions, state land committee and state irrigation committee. The selected staff will be redeployed to&#13;
work as a team in the farm development units. The FDU would include an agronomist, economist,&#13;
veterinarian, credit specialist, irrigation water management engineer and construction engineer and land&#13;
registration specialist. The Ministry of Justice would provide support for formalizing certificate and title&#13;
deeds. FDU personnel would be provided with necessary training in farm privatization principles,&#13;
procedures, information development and dissemination.  During the initial period of project&#13;
implementation, the central unit in Baku is expected to play an important role in the management and&#13;
implementation of the farm support services in the project farms. During this period, the raion level&#13;
officials would be trained in new methods and techniques that can subsequently be replicated to other&#13;
farms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Irrigation and Drainage Works&#13;
4.8    Field Level Irrigation and Drainage Works will be executed by the privatized farm units&#13;
following the guidelines, standards and estimates recommended by the State Irrigation Planning and&#13;
Design Institute (SIPDI) under the guidance of farm guides of raion level Agrokombinat. Credit for the&#13;
on-farm works will be provided out of the project funds through the Agroprombank, as term loan, subject&#13;
to the eligibility criteria set out in Text Box 3.1.&#13;
4.9    Main Irrigation Water Supply and Drainage Works. These, including the access roads, will&#13;
be executed by contractors in accordance with the standard specification of SIPDI and will be supervised&#13;
by the raion level irrigation engineer of the SIC. The Raion Administration, Department of Agriculture&#13;
and SIC would adopt a set of criteria and weights by which the individual canal, drainage collector, and&#13;
access roads would be ranked for execution. SIPDI will be responsible for overall supervision of these&#13;
works,&#13;
4r 10   Community Development Component. The implementation of this pilot operation will be&#13;
carried out with the assistance of an International Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). Priority for&#13;
support would be based on: (a) income level; (b) existing social services and infrastructure networks; and&#13;
(c) willingness of the community to adopt a participatory approach. Agreement was reached during&#13;
negot iations that before initiation of any community development activities, the Government would select&#13;
and appoint a suitably qualified Non-Governmental Organization, acceptable to IDA/IFAD to assist in&#13;
the preparation and execution of the community development program.&#13;
C. STATUS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Present Status&#13;
4. 11  The status of project design, components, implementation and financing arrangements is as&#13;
follows: (i) the concepts underlying the farm privatization process; limited scope of the project; and the&#13;
activities to be undertaken in each of the project components have been agreed; (ii) privatization&#13;
commissions at the raion and farm levels have been established; the process of assessing non-land assets&#13;
and allocation of land shares is being completed; (iii) a memorandum of understanding between the&#13;
Agroprombank and MOF outlining the terms and conditions of on-lending has been agreed; (iv) the State&#13;
Irrigation Committee has awarded the contract to SIPDI for farm irrigation and drainage rehabilitation&#13;
works; and (v) training of eight key officials in land registration aspects was undertaken in Canada,&#13;
funded by the Canadian Trust Fund, to obtain first hand information about the functioning of land&#13;
registration office, real estate office, land market transactions, state surveying and mapping agency,&#13;
municipalities, etc.&#13;
Iniplementation Schedule&#13;
4.12   The project will be implemented over a five year period. A summary of the implementation&#13;
schedule for various critical activities and their timings are presented in Annex A-2. Agreement was&#13;
reached during negotiations that the Government shall not reverse the provisions provided in the land&#13;
reform law for individual land ownership and the freedom to use, buy, sell, present, exchange, mortgage,&#13;
rent out and inherit land during the execution of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES&#13;
4.13   Procurement of all goods and services for the project would follow World Bank guidelines,&#13;
(Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA credits, January 1995). Locally manufactured&#13;
goods would be eligible for domestic preference as provided in Appendix 2 of the Guidelines. The use&#13;
of Bank's standard bidding documents: Procurement of Goods (January 1995) would be mandatory for&#13;
all ICB procurement. Selection of consultants for technical assistance and training would follow World&#13;
Bank guidelines, (Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency, August 1981). A general procurement notice will be published in the Development&#13;
Business in January 1997, informing potential bidders of procurement activities and the expected release&#13;
of bidding documents. The Project Launch Workshop will be conducted in Baku, Azerbaijan in February&#13;
1997, where project components, organization and implementation arrangements, procurement methods,&#13;
and disbursement procedures to be used for all project financed contracts will be discussed with the&#13;
project staff and the beneficiaries.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
4.14   All Procurement for the project would be coordinated and approved by the Project Management&#13;
Unit. The State Irrigation Committee (SIC) would be responsible for the procurement of irrigation and&#13;
drainage works. State Land Committee (SLC) will be responsible for the procurement of the goods and&#13;
services required for land registration. All procurement related activities will be carried out by trained&#13;
staff located in each of the implementing agencies. They will be responsible for the organization and&#13;
management of project procurement activities within their agencies and would report to PMU. However,&#13;
the Director, PMU will be responsible for the overall management and supervision of project&#13;
procurement. The local procurement staff would be trained by an internationally recruited procurement&#13;
specialist in Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, on a full time basis for an initial period for&#13;
six months. The performance of the procurement consultant and the need for extension would be assessed&#13;
during project supervision and appropriate modifications, will be made accordingly. The project involves&#13;
the procurement of civil works, goods and equipment and services by public and by private sector&#13;
agencies. Procurement procedures are described in the following paragraphs and summarized in Table&#13;
4.1. The project procurement plan providing details of various procurement packages is presented in&#13;
Annex B.&#13;
Goods and Equipment&#13;
4.15  International Competitive Bidding (ICB):  Goods and equipment, estimated to cost above&#13;
US$200,000, such as equipment for PMU/PIU offices, cadastral survey and mapping equipment,&#13;
laboratory equipment for SLC, maintenance machinery for SIC, computers and vehicles would be&#13;
packaged appropriately and procured following ICB procedures. Domestic manufactures would be given&#13;
a preferential margin which would be determined according to the methodology described in Appendix&#13;
2 (Domestic Preference) of the Guidelines.&#13;
4.16  International Shopping (IS) and National Shopping (NS): International Shopping will be used for&#13;
readily available, off the shelf goods and equipment valued at US$200,000 or less per contract up to an&#13;
aggregate amount not to exceed US$500,000. IS would be based on quotations from at least three&#13;
suppliers in two different countries. National Shopping would be used where the desired goods are&#13;
ordinarily available locally from more than one source at competitive prices and normally for small value&#13;
purchases valued at US$50,000 or less per contract.&#13;

kl       Cofinanced with IFAD (US$0.8 million).&#13;
1/       PPF refinancing for goods, services, civil works and operating costs, includes Direct Contracting for the design of Irrigation and&#13;
Drainage Works from SIPDI, total value US$ 160,000.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
4.17    Civil works mostly consists of rehabilitation of main and secondary canals and water control&#13;
structures. These will be grouped together, as far as possible, into one contract for each raion. A total&#13;
of five contracts are expected ranging in size from a minimum of US$150,000 to a maximum of US$1.7&#13;
million in the five raions. Only one contract for irrigation rehabilitation works is expected to be below&#13;
US$200,000, following NCB procedures. The remaining four contracts would be procured through ICB,&#13;
using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for small works. Domestic contractors would be eligible&#13;
for domestic preference according to Bank guidelines. Civil works construction organizations are present&#13;
in nearly all five raions, which during the Soviet era, developed considerable construction capabilities.&#13;
These former state organizations have recently been privatized and converted into joint stock companies;&#13;
have financial and managerial autonomy and do not receive subsidy from Government and therefore meet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
the eligibility criteria of the Bank's guidelines.  These joint stock companies would be permitted to&#13;
participate in the bidding for works, provided they meet the qualification criteria.&#13;
4.18   Procurement of pumping and sprinkler irrigation system equipment would generally involve&#13;
supply and install contracts which would include proper installation of imported pumping and sprinkler&#13;
equipment by the supplier. The project would finance three such contracts costing about US$60,000&#13;
each. Civil works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 for office rehabilitation will be undertaken&#13;
using simplified NCB procedures, i.e. lump sum, fixed price contract awarded on the basis of quotations&#13;
from three domestic contractors in response to a written invitation.&#13;
Procurement Under On-Lending Terms and Conditions by Final-Borrowers&#13;
4.19  In the first year of project implementation, the PMU in coordination with Agroprombank would&#13;
assist the privatized farms/enterprises in procurement activities. In the following years, assistance will&#13;
be provided only if required by the farm units. Subprojects would be financed in part by the IDA/IFAD&#13;
credit line and in part by the final beneficiaries' own funds. Therefore, the subproject size will exceed&#13;
the sub-loan amounts. Based on this, the following procurement thresholds will apply: (i) procurement&#13;
of goods estimated to cost up to US$50,000 may be procured on the basis of three quotations in the&#13;
domestic market; (ii) contracts for goods between US$50,000 and US$200,000 will be required to follow&#13;
the Bank's International Shopping (IS) procedure, and above US$200,000 will follow ICB procedures;&#13;
(iii) all field level civil works, estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract,would be awarded on&#13;
the basis of three quotations in the domestic market, in response to written invitation. Those works which&#13;
are estimated to cost between US$50,000 and US$200,000 will follow NCB procedures acceptable to&#13;
Bank. The borrower will use Bank's sample NCB document. There is little likelihood that there will&#13;
be works which would cost above US$200,000 under line of credit. In the event that such a contract may&#13;
cost above US$200,000, then ICB procedures will be followed. The general sub-loan agreement between&#13;
the farms/enterprises and the Agroprombank would provide for such an arrangement.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
4.20   The project would finance technical assistance and training program for institutional development.&#13;
A number of short-term and long-term consulting services for various specialized activities such as farm&#13;
privatization, land registration system, credit, accounting and financial systems, construction and&#13;
management of irrigation systems, Water User Association, etc, would be provided for the&#13;
implementation of the project. As far as possible, the consulting services required for the project&#13;
implementation will be aggregated and will be procured on the basis of short listing of firms. For short&#13;
term assignments of specialized nature, individual consultants would be used and the selection will be&#13;
made from short-listed candidates acceptable to the Bank which will review the candidate's CVs&#13;
experience and performance. The project will provide for a sole source (SS) contract for the preparation&#13;
of detailed irrigation and drainage design between the State Irrigation Committee and the Irrigation&#13;
Design Institute (SIPDI). This sole source contract is not expected to exceed US$160,000. This is being&#13;
done since SIPDI has the necessary basic data and expertise and would be cost effective.&#13;
Prior Review&#13;
4.21  IDA shall review the procurement arrangements, including contract packaging, applicable&#13;
procedures and the scheduling of the procurement process as stated in Appendix 1 of the Guidelines. All&#13;
ICB procurement of goods and works will be subject to prior review. The Bank will also pre-review the&#13;
first two NCB contracts for civil works. Consultancy assignments valued at greater than US$100,000&#13;
with consulting firms, if any, and assignments valued at greater than US$50,000 with individuals, if any,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
will be subject to prior review by the Bank. However, prior review shall apply to all terms of references,&#13;
sole source selection and assignments of critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank.&#13;
Incremental Operating Costs&#13;
4.22  Incremental operating costs consist of incremental staff salaries, vehicle operating costs, office&#13;
supplies and office communication expenses. Incremental operating costs will be financed to operate&#13;
PMU and PIUs on a sliding scale, 80 percent in the first and second year, 60 percent in the third and&#13;
fourth year and 40 percent in year five. Procurement of small equipment and supplies, if any, under&#13;
operating costs will follow the threshlolds and prior review requirements specified in paragraphs 4.15 and&#13;
4.16.&#13;
E. DISBuRSEMENT&#13;
4.23   The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2001. IDA funds would be disbursed&#13;
either directly or through the Special Account on the basis of "Withdrawal Requests" signed by authorized&#13;
signatories under the control of the Project Management Unit (PMU). IDA financing would follow the&#13;
normal World Bank disbursement procedures as summarized in the Disbursement Handbook. A schedule&#13;
of the estimated disbursement of the proposed IDA credit is shown in Annex C.&#13;
4.24   Disbursements would be made against eligible project expenditures for civil works, goods,&#13;
technical assistance, training and studies; credit; and operating costs according to the percentages of&#13;
expenditures indicated in Table 4.2. Disbursements for contracts of or above US$50,000 equivalent would&#13;
be made against full documentation, and for those less than this amount will be made against statements&#13;
of expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documents would be retained in the Project Office in Baku and in&#13;
the raion project implementation units and will be made available for IDA/IFAD supervision missions&#13;
and for external auditors. These will be kept for at least three years after disbursement. It was agreed&#13;
during negotiations that as a condition of disbursement, payments for expenditures in respect of civil&#13;
works and credit to privatizedfarm units from IDA and IFAD proceeds would be made only for the sub-&#13;
project selected, approved and implemented in accordance with the procedures and eligibility criteria,&#13;
specified in Schedule I of the Credit Agreement and satisfactory to IDA/IFAD.&#13;
F. SPECIAL ACCOUNT&#13;
4.25    The Government of Azerbaijan Republic has established, under conditions acceptable to IDA,&#13;
a special account in US Dollars in the International Bank of Azerbaijan to facilitate timely project&#13;
implementation. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the Special Account would&#13;
be limited to US$100,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached&#13;
the level of US$1.00 Million equivalent, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized&#13;
allocation of US$300,000 by submitting the relevant application for withdrawal. Replenishment&#13;
application should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements&#13;
as well as other appropriate supporting documents. The Ministry of Finance will send requests to IDA&#13;
for replenishment of the Special Account, accompanied by detailed monthly bank statements for the&#13;
account in Baku. IDA will replenish only the principal special account established in the name of the&#13;
Government of Azerbaijan. It was agreed during negotiations that a project account will be opened in&#13;
a commercial bank satisfactory to the Bank by the Government and would deposit US$150, 000 in local&#13;
currency equivalent to meet the needs of counterpart funds requiredfor project implementation. This is&#13;
a condition of project effectiveness.&#13;

G. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
4.26   The project would establish an accounting and control system which will have the capability of&#13;
recording and retrieving all financial transactions associated with the project in a timely manner and&#13;
comply with internationally accepted accounting standards. This will be used for tracking both the&#13;
counterpart funds and that to be provided by IDA credit and IFAD loan. These accounts will be&#13;
maintained at PMU, Baku; in each of the participating raion administrations and by Agroprombank for&#13;
the credit provided to privatized farms.&#13;
4.27   The annual accounts for the project, including SOEs and special accounts for each fiscal year,&#13;
and sub-project accounts of the borrowers, would be audited in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
auditing standards. It will be carried out by an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA The auditors&#13;
would be appointed by the borrower and sub-borrowers early in the fiscal year, so that the auditors may&#13;
commence their reviews sufficiently early in the fiscal year to complete the audit on a timely basis. It was&#13;
agreed during negotiations that the Government would provide, within six months of the end of each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Governmentalfiscal year, an audit report of such scope and details as IDA/IFAD may request, including&#13;
a separate opinion by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA/IFAD, on disbursements. This would&#13;
be a project covenant.&#13;
H. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS&#13;
4.28   The Project Management Unit, with the assistance of each of the PIUs and the Agroprombank&#13;
will be responsible for the preparation of necessary reports to be submitted to the Government and to&#13;
IDA/IFAD. These periodic reports will monitor the progress of the project, identify potential problem&#13;
areas in implementation and assist the periodic supervision missions to be carried out by IDA/IFAD.&#13;
Agreement was reached during negotiations on the provision and content of periodic progress reports,&#13;
which reviews the status of project execution, identification of problems relating to project execution or&#13;
areas in which the project execution could be improved to ensure the efficient implementation of the&#13;
project and the achievement of project objectives. These reports will focus on the following broad areas:&#13;
(i)    Privatization Process. This would consist of quarterly reports indicating the status of the&#13;
privatization of the project farms, individual land parcels allocated, issuance of titles,&#13;
main bottlenecks encountered and remedial actions to be taken;&#13;
(ii)   Physical Performance of the Project. This would consist of semi-annual reports showing&#13;
actual and planned performance of all the physical indicators of the project, such as on-&#13;
farm and off-farm irrigation and drainage works, farm access roads, etc. These reports&#13;
will be submitted to IDA no later than 30 days after the end of each quarter and would&#13;
specifically highlight problem areas, bottlenecks and show an action plan for remedial&#13;
actions;&#13;
(iii)   Financial Progress. This would consist of quarterly reports indicating: (i) a schedule&#13;

V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1    The main benefit of the project is the development of new models of farm restructuring, farm&#13;
support and production structures necessary for the transformation of the agricultural sector into a&#13;
competitive market oriented system and which could be replicated to other parts of the country. This&#13;
requires reasonably secure and registered land rights; improved information and advisory services;&#13;
favorable relative agricultural input and output prices; combination of credit/grants to provide for&#13;
seasonal working capital requirements, longer term finance for essential farm equipment, land levelling&#13;
and rehabilitation of irrigation systems to provide reliable water supply to farms and relief from the&#13;
obligation to finance social assets.&#13;
B. ECONOMic AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
5.2    Consistency with Country Assistance Strategy: The objectives and the activities envisaged in the&#13;
proposed project are consistent with the Bank's overall priorities for private and financial sector strategies&#13;
outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),3' with the recommendations made in the Bank's&#13;
Agricultural Sector Review undertaken in July 1995, 4' and as agreed with the Government of Azerbaijan&#13;
Republic. The Government's recent initiatives to create an appropriate policy environment for land&#13;
privatization and farm restructuring provides the basis for the proposed project. These include the recent&#13;
passage and approval of the Land Reform Law and Irrigation and Amelioration Law in the Parliament,&#13;
gradual movement of energy prices towards international prices, reduction in Government's role in the&#13;
procurement of agricultural products and the liberalization of agricultural input and output prices and&#13;
trade.&#13;
5.3    Economic Benefits: The project would yield principally two broad types of economic benefits,&#13;
one, create and promote an enabling environment for privatized agriculture and two, increased crop&#13;
productivity and farm incomes.&#13;
5.4    Enabling environment for privatized agriculture: This would result from the following project&#13;
activities:&#13;
(a)    Land Registration System. The modernization and security of the land registration&#13;
system with appropriate procedures would provide clarity of land titles, instill confidence&#13;
in individuals over legal rights to land ownership, and form the basis for land mortgaging&#13;
terms, which would contribute to the development of land markets. During the project&#13;
period, it is expected that about 4800 land titles would be issued to private individuals;&#13;
(b)    Farm Information and Advisory Services. The farm information and advisory services&#13;
component is critical for ensuring that farmers are well informed about business and&#13;
organization alternatives and how to function in a market economy. The project's&#13;
emphasis on timely and wide dissemination during the privatization and restructuring&#13;
process beyond the project raions is expected to have a significant impact on similar&#13;
processes in other farms. The use of mass media and participatory workshops to build&#13;

consensus and to develop community based programs is expected to promote "project&#13;
ownership" by the beneficiaries and the various agencies - critical elements to ensure&#13;
speedy project implementation. Increasing awareness of market economy would enable&#13;
the privatized farm units to evaluate relative profitability of alternative crop and livestock&#13;
activities and to enter new markets. The training and technical assistance being provided&#13;
is expected to result in a large number of trained people in the privatization process,&#13;
modern farm and enterprise management practices appropriate to a market economy;&#13;
(c)    Credit Services Support. Training the staff of the raion level branches of Agroprombank&#13;
in project appraisal methods, risk evaluation and techniques for financing working capital&#13;
and investment requirements for privatized farm structures, putting in place a modern&#13;
accounting system and providing credit on the basis of financial, economic, social and&#13;
technical viability are expected to provide valuable lessons in the development of a rural&#13;
financial system; and&#13;
(d)    Reorienting the Functions of Agriculture Department.  The management approach&#13;
suggested for this project is expected to begin the process of transformation of the&#13;
traditional functions of the Ministry of Agriculture at the state and raion levels. At the&#13;
state level, it would help to instill a team work ethic, while the collaborative work of&#13;
MOA, SLC, SIC is expected to improve work efficiency and reduction in duplication of&#13;
tasks. At the raion level, the new irrigation and drainage systems based on hydrological&#13;
boundaries would encourage greater efficiency and sustainability and make it easier for&#13;
the collection of water user charges and foster the formation of water user's associations.&#13;
Quantification of these institutional benefits would be made through periodic monitoring&#13;
of select indicators (provided in Annex A-4).&#13;
5.5   Increase in Crop Productivity and Farm Incomes: The complete liberalization of fruit, vegetable&#13;
and livestock products and all agricultural inputs, increase in prices of wheat and cotton, and prevalence&#13;
of a stable exchange rate regime over the last two years has increased the per hectare returns of the major&#13;
crops in the project area, which are: cotton, wheat, barley, forage crops, fruits and vegetables and&#13;
livestock products.  Given the good agro-ecological conditions and abundant supplies of energy,&#13;
Azerbaijan has a comparative advantage for efficient production in these agricultural products.&#13;
5.6    Given the nature of this project, and the difficulties in predicting the exact number of privatized&#13;
individual sub-projects to be financed, a project wide economic rate of return is not possible. However,&#13;
typical farm models have been analyzed to indicate the crop profitability and impact on farm incomes.&#13;
The financial rate of return for typical farm models are about 20 percent. Under fully liberalized&#13;
conditions, and using economic prices for inputs and outputs, the economic rates of return are about 25&#13;
percent. The underlying assumptions have been provided in Annex F. With privatization, changes in&#13;
the present cropping pattern are expected to occur which will involve an increase in perennial forage&#13;
legumes, introduction of maize, intensification of cotton, wheat, fruits and vegetables. Improvement in&#13;
the irrigation and drainage system would increase the cropping intensity from the present 83 percent to&#13;
117 percent, which would result from the cultivation of early maturing vegetables in addition to wheat&#13;
or cotton. The projected crop yields and cropping pattern are presented in Figure 5.1. Farm incomes&#13;
are expected to rise by about 50 to 100 percent in real terms over a five year period. Improved&#13;
technology practices combined with the efficiency expected from an "owner operated farm enterprise"&#13;

is expected to increase the overall farm profitability and farm incomes. This analysis reveals that typical&#13;
farm units would be able to pay for the betterment tax to recover 50 percent of the costs of improvements&#13;
in irrigation and drainage structures and land, as well as water charges covering the full costs of operation&#13;
and maintenance of irrigation and drainage works and service the debt on their loans.&#13;
5.7    The economic and financial rates of return on these model farms drop to about 13 and 10 percent&#13;
respectively, if there is a 20 percent or more increase in total costs or decrease in total revenues. To&#13;
ensure that the project yields are achieved in the privatized farm units, the project would provide the&#13;
necessary farm support services and credit support. The risk of cost overruns is reduced by limiting the&#13;
investments to only rehabilitation works and those which meet the eligibility criteria (see para 3.17).&#13;
C. MARKETING ASPECTS&#13;
5.8    The market for agricultural produce is firmly set on adjusting to the market economy. Sales of&#13;
most farm products, including vegetables, fruit and livestock products are totally dictated by the free&#13;
market. In theory, state orders have continued to apply in 1995 to old kolkhozes and sovkhozes for&#13;
production of strategic commodities wheat (30 percent of output) and cotton. These state orders have&#13;
now been abolished.&#13;
5.9    Wheat marketing occurs at two levels: (i) any products contracted to the Government are paid&#13;
for at the point of delivery (local silo); and (ii) output beyond any contracted commitment is partially&#13;
conserved on the farm as seeds stock and the remainder is distributed to the farm workers as wages. Any&#13;
part of the workers' share not retained for family consumption is sold in local markets. It is expected&#13;
that all grain products in 1996 will be sold on the open market. With respect to cotton, it has been sold&#13;
mostly through the Liverpool commodities exchange and historically, the export crop has been sold to&#13;
a small number of European importers. Export sales are generally made f.o.b. at the Iran border on the&#13;
Caspian Sea and cotton is carried by lorry from the ginneries to the Persian Gulf for shipment.&#13;
Therefore, cotton exports are not affected by international blockades. Since 1993, Government has been&#13;
unable to totally refinance the cotton crop before export. Therefore, a payment of 30 percent of the lint&#13;
value is paid on delivery and the remainder from the export receipts - typically in April of the succeeding&#13;
year. This delay in payment is proving a major disincentive for producers and cotton production has&#13;
declined drastically, from 400,000 tons in 1991 to 273,000 tons in 1995. During negotiations, it was&#13;
agreed that the Government would adopt a plan, not later than March 31, 1997, for providing prompt&#13;
payments to farmers for the procurement of cotton.&#13;
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.10   The project would be successful if it is replicable and the activities are sustainable beyond the&#13;
project life. The project's emphasis on essential support services, such as, land registration, farm&#13;
information and advisory services, (estimated to cost about US$5 million over a five year period in six&#13;
regions of the country) would lay the basis for building such services across the country.  It is&#13;
anticipated, that beyond this initial phase, the costs associated with public investment on these support&#13;
services could be recovered from the beneficiaries, through taxes, betterment levy or cess. The recurrent&#13;
costs of the support services beyond the project period has been estimated at about US$590,000 per year,&#13;
or about US$6 per hectare, and assumes that 50 percent of the total area in the five raions would be&#13;
serviced by this support service. Of this, about 22 percent comprises salaries of staff, and the remainder&#13;
are vehicle operating costs, office supplies, utilities and communication. As this project is part of the&#13;
Government's program for land privatization, the recurrent costs would be financed from existing&#13;
resources and through revenue collection from taxes and fees for land titles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
5.11   The investment needs for on-farm and inter-farm irrigation works are based on the minimum&#13;
required for rehabilitation so as to ensure timely water supply and improve water use efficiency in the&#13;
main, secondary and tertiary canals. These works are simple in their design, use locally available&#13;
materials and are easy to operate and maintain. Assuming that about 70 percent of the 1.4 million ha&#13;
of total agricultural lands under irrigation need to be rehabilitated, at the rate of about US$700/ha would&#13;
require a total investment of about US$700 million - averaging about US$35 million per year over a&#13;
twenty year period. In the case of the grant element, it is to be provided to on-farm investments only,&#13;
which at the assumed rate of 25 percent of US$400/ha, a total of US$100 million for a million hectares -&#13;
or US$5 million per year over a twenty year period is needed. The capitalization grants is necessary to&#13;
jump-start the privatization process and provide incentives to the first timers who are willing to take&#13;
market risks. Regarding the Government's ability to afford such a grant scheme, according to the&#13;
estimates provided by IMF and the World Bank, per capita GNP growth rates are expected to show large&#13;
increases beginning in 1998 of about 14 percent per year through the year 2003, largely fueled by&#13;
revenues from petroleum exports which are expected to be about $0.7, $1.1, $1.6 and $2.4 billion in&#13;
2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively. Given the possibility of such a scenario, the investment needs&#13;
and grant element incorporated in the project could be easily absorbed, if replicated in a nationwide scale,&#13;
with little or no fiscal impact.&#13;
E. POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
5.12   The proposed project's design incorporates several elements to minimize the potential and any&#13;
likely negative impact on certain farm members, especially in light of the significant decline in real wages&#13;
of the working population and erosion of savings during the last three years. This vulnerable group are&#13;
expected to be the newly laid off farm laborers, comparatively low income small holding farmers,&#13;
agricultural laborers, women,children and pensioners of the privatized project farms. The community&#13;
development component would: (i) promote people based community development activities using&#13;
participatory approaches; (ii) provide one-time grants to start new entrepreneurial activities; (iii)&#13;
strengthen local groups to take an active part in the land privatization and farm restructuring process&#13;
through participation, education and media campaign; (iv) provide opportunities for training to target&#13;
groups in a variety of new skill areas; and (v) encourage the development of support organizations such&#13;
as the water user's association and involve NGO's and local civic groups in various community&#13;
development programs.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.13   In accordance and consistent with the requirements of the Bank OD 4.01, "Environmental&#13;
Assessment", the project has been screened and placed into EA Category "B", which requires the&#13;
preparation of an environmental analysis to define environmental management, monitoring and mitigation&#13;
measures as necessary. The proposed actions are: (i) regular monitoring of effluents into collector drains&#13;
and ensuring that they are within environmentally acceptable limits; (ii) permit use of only&#13;
environmentally safe (FAO Codex) pesticides for crop production (a negative list of pesticides will be&#13;
provided to the concerned institutions; (iii) monitoring of soil and water salinity levels; and (iv) undertake&#13;
environmental and sociological studies to identify other environmental concerns and to determine&#13;
mitigatory measures. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the procedures, timing, and related&#13;
institutional arrangements for environmental assessment.&#13;
5.14   The project is expected to have a positive impact on the environment. The rehabilitation of&#13;
irrigation and drainage works is expected to help improve water use efficiency, check the process of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
salinization and water logging, arrest the process of land degradation and enable more prudent use of&#13;
land. The ownership of land assets is expected to instill a greater sense of individual and community&#13;
responsibility and stimulate measures for the protection of the environment. The land use map using&#13;
modem techniques will enhance the ability to integrate data sets into the land register with beneficial&#13;
applications for monitoring and control of the environment. Details of the project environmental analysis&#13;
and the review procedures have been presented in Annex G.&#13;
G. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
5.15   The process and outcome of project interventions will be monitored and evaluated. A baseline&#13;
survey would be carried out during the first year of project implementation, covering all the project&#13;
raions participating in the project. Non-project farms would be included in the evaluation to form the&#13;
control group. As the pace of privatization is expected to proceed rapidly, annual surveys would be&#13;
conducted to determine the lessons learnt, what works and what does not work. Sufficient flexibility&#13;
would be provided in the project design to make changes as the lessons are learnt. The monitoring&#13;
indicators have been provided in Annex A-4. These are: (i) Farm Privatization Indicators covering a&#13;
wide range of variables, such as ownership, organization, attitudes, etc.; (ii) Privatization Impact&#13;
Indicators focussing on assessment of the effectiveness of information development and dissemination,&#13;
crop and livestock production, income levels, crop diversification, etc.; (iii) Social Impact Indicators&#13;
focussing on impact on target group, provision of social services, social stress, etc.; (iv) Project&#13;
Replicability Indicators, such as average cost of privatization support services per privatized farm,&#13;
irrigation and drainage, on-farm investment costs per ha of privatized farm, etc.; (v) Physical Indicators&#13;
focussing on inter-farm irrigation and drainage works, on-farm investments, etc.; and (vi) Financial&#13;
Indicators, such as recovery rates of sub-loans, debt service, cost recovery for infrastructure investment,&#13;
expenditures, etc. Special studies would be carried out by independent groups and a mid-term review&#13;
undertaken to draw lessons from the privatization process in the project farms. During negotiations, it&#13;
was agreed that all project beneficiaries would report to IDAIIFAD on a half-yearly basis on the status&#13;
of the agreed key monitoring and evaluation indicators which would be a project covenant.&#13;
H. PARTICIPATORY APPROACH&#13;
5.16   The administration of the land privatization process in the Azerbaijan Republic essentially is a&#13;
bottom up approach, where the broad based local commissions at the farm or village level are provided&#13;
with adequate authority to decide on important issues concerning land distribution. The project has built&#13;
in several features which would strengthen this approach and consistently involve the beneficiaries in the&#13;
management of the project and be responsible for the outcome. The representation of the farms by&#13;
elected officials in the Project Steering Committee, Central Project Implementation Unit and the Raion&#13;
project implementation units in each of the project raions would ensure that their interests are made&#13;
known and actions by consensus are taken, so as to maximize beneficiary involvement. The creation of&#13;
water users' associations and groups would secure farmer's participation in decision making for water&#13;
scheduling, distribution, cost recovery operation and maintenance. Project's emphasis on wide-spread&#13;
dissemination and awareness campaign using different mass media of the privatization procedures and&#13;
experience of the process would help the beneficiaries make informed decisions. The involvement of an&#13;
NGO would help develop, promote and implement people-based community development activities.&#13;
Participatory approaches which were used during the preparation of the project to develop needs based&#13;
components and to build consensus would be an integral part throughout project implementation period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
I. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.17   The project faces four main risks. These relate to: (i) sustainability of privatized farms as&#13;
financially viable units; (ii) replicability of this project; (iii) Government's ability to co-ordinate the multi-&#13;
disciplinary activities needed for privatization and farm restructuring; and (iv) lack of implementation&#13;
experience.&#13;
(i)    Project Replicability.  The first risk relates to the extent to which the incentives,&#13;
procedures, policies, investments and selection criteria used in this project could be&#13;
replicated to other parts of the country, for, herein, lies the success of the project.&#13;
Although the project farms have been chosen to be representative and have agreed to the&#13;
principles of farm restructuring, there is a risk that some may not co-operate. In this&#13;
event, the project would provide for other farms in the raion to participate who are&#13;
willing to go through the agreed processes and procedures. In addition, the project's&#13;
emphasis on periodic public dissemination of the privatization and restructuring process&#13;
throughout the raion and in other parts of the country is expected to jump start other&#13;
privatization initiatives;&#13;
(ii)    Sustaining Financial Viability of Privatized Farms. The second risk is the continued&#13;
ability of the privatized farm units to operate as financially viable operations and be able&#13;
to service the working capital and investment loans. In this regard, the financial analysis,&#13;
based on conservative yield increases and current market prices, reveals that the "new&#13;
privatized farms" would be able to generate sufficient cash flows to repay loans. The&#13;
size of farm holdings would range between 5 to 10 ha per family household, which&#13;
together with their household "garden plots" and cattle would provide adequate income&#13;
to continue farming. However, if the price liberalization policies were to be reversed,&#13;
and the prices remain unchanged, then the rate of return becomes marginal, yielding&#13;
about 12 percent. The implementation of the Government's price and trade liberalization&#13;
policies, expected macro-economic stabilization in the near term, resolution of border&#13;
conflicts and opening of marketing channels is expected to sustain the financial viability&#13;
of the privatized farms. In this regard, a proposed Structural Adjustment Credit, which&#13;
would address the broader policy reform areas of liberalization of input and output&#13;
prices, dismantling of state monopolies and removal of trade restrictions on agricultural&#13;
inputs and outputs is expected to further minimize this risk;&#13;
(iii)   Coordination and Sequencing of Pre-and Post-Privatization Activities. The third risk&#13;
is the ability of the Government to co-ordinate the various tasks, sequencing and timely&#13;
delivery of the services required for farm privatization and restructuring to take place.&#13;
A clear assignment of agency responsibilities and supervision by the State Commission&#13;
for Farm Privatization is expected to mitigate the co-ordination problem; and&#13;
(iv)   Lack of Implementation Experience. The fourth risk relates to potential delays in&#13;
project implementation due to lack of experience of the implementing agencies in&#13;
IDA/IFAD procedures; obtaining Government agreement to the various criteria, funding&#13;
mechanisms and co-financing arrangements. The project has taken steps to commence&#13;
project start up activities through training of key officials in various project related areas,&#13;
provision of technical assistance; obtaining the most important agreements and&#13;
commitments from the Government before negotiations and involving IFAD at an early&#13;
stage of project processing to avoid delays in finalizing co-financing arrangements.&#13;
&#13;

AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC&#13;
FARM PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
PROFILE OF PARTICIPATING FARMS&#13;
1.    The project farms are situated in the raions of Barda, Salyan, Udjar, Lenkoran, Xachmaz and&#13;
Sharur. The first five farms, agro-ecologically, fall under three major zones, i.e. Salyan, Udjar and&#13;
Barda in the Kur-Araz Zone, Lenkoran in the Talish Zone, and Xachmaz under the large Caucasus zone.&#13;
The sixth farm in Sharur raion of Nakhchivan autonomous republic, is located west of Arpa river, under&#13;
agro-ecologically dry climate in Arpa-Arakh zone. These farms are representative of the agroclimatic&#13;
zones of Azerbaijan. Only five farms i.e. Ghilingili farm of Barda, Gulaband-Hatai farm of Udjar,&#13;
Shafag farm of Salyan and Yergouz farm of Xachmaz have been appraised. The sixth farm is proposed to&#13;
be appraised in 1997.&#13;
Land Resources&#13;
2.    The total geographical area of the five appraised project farms is about 14,970 ha of which about&#13;
9900 ha is cultivable land and is dependent on irrigation (7646 ha). Detailed land resources by farm is&#13;
presented in Table 1.&#13;

* Water- logged, poorly irrigated or saline land; # After rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation canal systems.&#13;
3.    Rehabilitation of the for crop production is constrained by lack of sufficient and timely&#13;
irrigation, lack of farm equipment and machinery and lack of working capital. The irrigation and&#13;
drainage infrastructure is dilapidated due to neglect of the canal and drainage system maintenance&#13;
which are silted and choked, water control structures are non-functional, leading to water logging and&#13;
salinity. Excellent potential exists to enhance the crop productivity through multiple cropping and&#13;
cropping intensity provided the present irrigation, drainage and other infrastructure are rehabilitated.&#13;

Farm Characteristics:&#13;
4.     All farms are well endowed with natural resources and can sustain the rural population.&#13;
However, there is a large (more than required) number of labor force who have been working in the&#13;
farm for many years (Table 2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62 -                                   ANNEX D&#13;
5.    The representative farms have been chosen by the Government because: (i) they are&#13;
representative of the major agro-ecological systems and have different cropping patterns; (ii) the farms&#13;
sizes are typical for the region concerned; (iii) they include different socio-economic groups; (iv) the&#13;
new owner's wish to follow different methods of farm re-restructuring; and (v) farm and raion&#13;
administration are committed to privatize and restructure the farm operations:&#13;
Agro-Ecological Characteristics: The main agroclimatic characteristics of the project farms are&#13;
described below:&#13;
*    Chilinjili-Barda has an annual average rainfall of 329 mm and annual average temperature of&#13;
14°C. The monthly average maximum and minimum rangesbetween 26.2°C and 2. 1C. The&#13;
region is hot, semi-dry lowland and crops like cotton, wheat, vegetables, fodder, grapes and&#13;
sub-tropical fruits trees are grown.&#13;
*    Narimanov-Lenkoran is situated in the south east, on the coastal plains between the foothills of&#13;
the Talish mountains and the coast of the Caspian Sea. It is characterized by an annual average&#13;
rain fall of 1402 mm and fertile soils suitable for the production of sub-tropical fruits,&#13;
vegetables and rice. An all-year round growing season necessitates irrigation, mainly to cover&#13;
dry summer months.&#13;
*    Shafag-Salyan, on the road from Baku to Lenkoran is characterized by a half dry and hot, with&#13;
low wind velocities up to 3 m/s. The average annual rainfall is 283 mm and the temperature&#13;
ranges from 2.5°C to 26.2°C. The major crops grown in this area are cotton and wheat.&#13;
*    Gulaband/Hatai-Udjar lies in the lowland plains of the Kur-Araz zone, temperatures soar up&#13;
to 41°C with low averages of only 14°C, dropping to below freezing point during winters.&#13;
The average precipitation ranges from 200 to 400 mm.&#13;
*    Yergouz-Xachmaz is located in the zone of the Big Caucasus and borders Russia in the north.&#13;
Its climate is moderately warm with annual precipitation of 334 mm. Suitable crops for the area&#13;
are: wheat, maize, tobacco, grapes, sunflower, rice, vegetables and deciduous fruits.&#13;
*    Sharur-Sharur raion is located west of Arpa river in Nakhachivan Autonomous Republic of&#13;
Azerbaijan. The total geographical area of the farm is 2027 ha of which 1222 ha is annually&#13;
cropped, 54 ha is under grape orchard and 92 ha is covered by fruit trees. Main crops are&#13;
cereal grains, tobacco, vegetables, and fruit crops like grapes, apple and pear. The average&#13;
annual precipitation is around 300 mm and the agriculture is irrigation based.&#13;
Cropping Systems&#13;
6.    These farms have fertile agricultural land that have considerable potential for growth in&#13;
agricultural productivity. develop economic potential and ensure sustained growth. Yet, during the&#13;
last few years, production levels in these farms have declined sharply. Low relative humidity and high&#13;
sunshine hours during crop growing season create a very favorable environment for crop growth, with&#13;
relatively low incidence of pests and diseases. The cropping pattern of the farns covered under the&#13;
project is presented in Table 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                                   ANNEX D&#13;
Present Yield Levels of the Farms&#13;
7.     Present yield levels of all crops grown on the project farms are relatively low for various&#13;
reasons. Under the former Soviet Union, and Azerbaijan was no exception, the State and collective&#13;
farns were rewarded on the basis of performance to State directed production orders, and not for their&#13;
productivity. The system did not, allow for incentives to raise productivity. Moreover, there was no&#13;
incentives: salaries of the farm workers were, with minor variations, fixed and private efforts simply&#13;
did not pay off. Crop yields of cereals, fruits and vegetables in these farms are about 50 -100 percent&#13;
below the potential. With privatization and restructuring, these farms would now seek to grow and&#13;
produce those crops and livestock activities for which there is a comparative advantage and respond to&#13;
market forces.&#13;
8.    There is ample scope to improve present crop yield levels. A reasonably secure and registered&#13;
land rights; improved information and advisory services, favourable relative agricultural input and&#13;
output prices, credit to provide for seasonal working capital, longer term finance for essential farm&#13;
equipment, land levelling and rehabilitation of irrigation systems to provide reliable water supply to&#13;
farms will provide a favourable conditions for increased crop productivity and farm incomes.&#13;

The complete liberalization of fruit, vegetable and livestock products and all agricultural inputs, increase&#13;
in prices of wheat and cotton, and prevalence of a stable exchange rate regime provides ample scope to&#13;
increase the per hectare returns of the major crops of the project farms. With privatization, changes in the&#13;
present cropping pattern are expected to occur which will involve an intensification of cotton, wheat,&#13;
fruits and vegetables, introduction of maize, increase in perenmial forage legumes. Increases in crop yields&#13;
of about 15-30 percent can be achieved through replacement of mono-cropping with double cropping&#13;
systems, specifically, introducing short duration high value vegetable crops preceding the main winter&#13;
wheat, replacement of F2 poor quality corn seeds with quality hybrid Fl seeds and use of high quality&#13;
&#13;

cotton seeds. Given the competitive market prices, farm incomes are expected to rise substantially by the&#13;
end of project period. Improved technology practices combined with the efficiency expected from an&#13;
"owner operated farm enterprise" is expected to increase the overall farm profitability and farm incomes.&#13;
The crop yields with and without project scenario is summarized in Table 5.&#13;

Livestock Production&#13;
9.    The average national livestock herd consists of 60 percent local breed and 40 percent imported&#13;
strains. There is a tendency to change from cattle to water buffalo in the private farms because of their their&#13;
efficient conversion rates from natural grasses to meat, resistance to diseases and greater reproduction&#13;
capacity, will result in higher incomes. Although s-'ne buffalo meat is sold at local markets, they are not&#13;
being used for draught purposes. A typical family owns 4 cows/buffalo and 4 sheep, which could&#13;
considerably higher when the workers are being paid in kind (livestock) instead of wages. The condition of&#13;
the livestock herds in Lenkoran and Salyan are relatively good in comparison with the ones in Xachmaz,&#13;
Udjar and Barda.&#13;

ANNEX E&#13;
PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    This report is prepared as a part of the environmental program of the Farm Privatization Project&#13;
in preparation to meet the environmental assessment requirements of Azerbaijan Government and the&#13;
World Bank. The Bank rules require that an Environmental Analysis (EA) is done prior to the&#13;
implementation of the Farm Privatization Project. EA is a process by which environmental impacts,&#13;
alternatives, and costs associated with development programs or investment programs are identified,&#13;
analyzed and evaluated. On the basis of this analysis, monitoring and mitigation measures are proposed&#13;
for incorporation into the design of the project programs and components, allowing required time to make&#13;
design changes and to explore environmentally cost effective alternatives. The project was presented to&#13;
Ministry of agriculture and referred to an expert team consisting of Dr. Assaf Assadov, Advisor in the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Mr. Nadim Kazibekov, Deputy Chairman of State Irrigation Committee;&#13;
Mr. Akif Veliyev of Land Committee and Mr. Arif Mansurov of State Committee for Ecology and&#13;
Natural Resources Utilization Control.&#13;
2.    The team examined the project documentation to identify the potential impacts (positive or&#13;
negative) of the Farm Privatization Project on environmental issues with the following in view:&#13;
(i)    To assess the actual environmental situation, before Farm  Privatization Project&#13;
implementation, and to identify potential direct and indirect impacts on the environment;&#13;
(ii)   To review the existing legislations as it relates to ensure sustainability of agriculture&#13;
production and the safe use and handling of pesticides, agrochemicals, and plant&#13;
fertilizers and guide the Ministry of Agriculture to develop environmental "best practice"&#13;
guidelines for the advising the farmers through extension personnel of FDUs.&#13;
3.    The Operational Directive 4.01 of the World Bank requires that project options under&#13;
consideration for Bank financing are environmentally sound and sustainable. The EA evaluates a&#13;
project's environmental impacts in its area of influence and identifies ways of improving project design&#13;
and implementation by preventing, minimizing, or compensating for adverse environmental impacts and&#13;
enhancing positive impacts.&#13;
4.    According to World Bank regulations the Farm Privatization Project is placed into EA category&#13;
"B" which means that it has a limited impact on the environment. The project is expected to foster more&#13;
prudent use of land, particularly agricultural land and environmentally sustainable farming practices with&#13;
greater sense of individual and community responsibility for the environment. The rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of irrigation and drainage system is expected to help improve water use efficiency, check&#13;
the process of salinization and water logging, arrest the process of land degradation. The project&#13;
activities to be implemented have a great importance for the promotion and recognition of ecologically&#13;
sustainable management the national resources of Azerbaijan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                                ANNEX E&#13;
5.    It is realistic to expect that the effects of some project components will strengthen the national&#13;
sustainable agriculture which combines technologies, policies, and activities aimed at integrating&#13;
socioeconomic principles with environmental concerns so as to maintain or enhance farm production,&#13;
reduce the risk of diminishing productivity, protect natural resources and prevent degradation of soil&#13;
fertility and water quality, all with a view to be economically viable, socially acceptable and technically&#13;
feasible. Hence it could be safely concluded that in implementing this Farm Privatization Project, no&#13;
negative impacts are expected.&#13;
6.     Since no direct negative environmental impacts are anticipated in the context of implementing&#13;
farm privatization project, this EA does not propose a specific mitigation plan (nor does it cost mitigation&#13;
efforts). However, as a an abundant caution against possible future intensive agriculture practices and&#13;
likely use of excessive agricultural chemicals and pesticides MOA would need to develop special ("best&#13;
practices") guidelines for the extension personnel to advise farming community in support of the concept&#13;
and practices of sustainable agriculture and appropriate handling of agriculture chemicals including the&#13;
hazardous pesticides.&#13;
7.     A major contribution to the development of the best practice guidelines is expected from the&#13;
findings of the National Environmental Action Plan (NAEP) collaborative study with the Government of&#13;
Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan Government has positively responded to the stipulation of the International&#13;
Development Association (IDA) to undertake a comprehensive environmental sector study. This study&#13;
will be the first input into the NAEP, which is conceived as an interactive strategy requiring periodic&#13;
updating. Considering the importance of the Azerbaijan's natural resources for economic growth, the&#13;
Bank has particularly targeted the agricultural sector for assistance under NAEP. The Joint NAEP team&#13;
is expected to contribute to the Government's overall development strategy by: (a) focussing the use of&#13;
scarce resources on immediate priority needs; (b) supporting institutional and regulatory improvements&#13;
over the near to medium-term; and (c) designing high priority investments and technical assistance for&#13;
funding from domestic and donor sources.&#13;
Status of Environmental Legislation&#13;
8.    The Law of Azerbaijan Republic "On Nature and Natural Resource Utilization" adopted in 1992&#13;
provides the broad legal base for State Committee for Ecology and Natural Resources Utilization&#13;
(SCE&amp;NRU) to review any investment projects in the state. Environmental legislation in Azerbaijan&#13;
Republic is not yet formed as uniform and systematic body. Azerbaijan has no previous experience in&#13;
conducting either project-specific or sectoral EA for agricultural development, including irrigation and&#13;
drainage management. At present, the FSU environmental, design and construction standards are being&#13;
used in the country.&#13;
9.     The environmental concerns are addressed in Azerbaijan as follows: First, "Otsenka&#13;
Voshzdeistviya na Okrujajushuiu Sredu" (OVOS), which is Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), done&#13;
usually by the project proponent, and second, "Gosudarstvennaya Ecologicheskaya Expertise" which is&#13;
State Ecological Expertise (SEE), which is mandatory for all investment projects, and constitute a process&#13;
of state review of the project's design together with the EIA. The SEE is required under the law "On&#13;
Environmental Protection", while the EIA process is instituted through a number of instructions and&#13;
guidelines issued by the SEC &amp; NRU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                                ANNEX E&#13;
Project Approach to Address Environmental Concerns&#13;
10.   There is a division for environmental analysis and management within the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture. Besides this, the PMU will get assistance of the SCE &amp; NRU for implementation,&#13;
coordination and enforcement of EIA in the project area through EIA/SEE legislation, procedures and&#13;
guidelines. The SCE &amp; NRU fills in the gaps by issuing directives, the applicability and validity. There&#13;
are shortcomings of the existing situation, clear rules as well as institutional capacity in the sector for&#13;
environmental monitoring and management, including development of "best environmental practices"&#13;
for agricultural sector, require improvement.&#13;
11.   The project PMU will secure the services of SCE &amp; NRU for: (i) development and introduction&#13;
of environmental "best practices" procedures, guidelines and manuals for the safe use and handling of&#13;
pesticides, agrochemicals, and plant fertilizers (as recommended by FAO and adopted elsewhere in&#13;
foreign countries) to enable the Ministry of Agriculture for the advising the farmers through extension&#13;
staff; (ii) develop techniques for the safe use of irrigation waters and drainage disposals; (iii) assist the&#13;
MOA to build-up its internal environmental institutional capacity to implement adoption of such&#13;
recommended practices; (iv) establish and strengthen procedural arrangements for implementation of EA&#13;
through EIA/SEE; and (v) work out procedures for cross-sectoral coordination of implementation and&#13;
enforcement of EIA and SEE requirements.&#13;
12.   This project has been classified into EA Category "B" which requires an environmental analysis,&#13;
even though potential adverse environmental impacts are not visualized, and no component would&#13;
significantly affect human populations or environmentally important areas and its activities are limited&#13;
to rehabilitation of existing irrigation and drainage systems and improvement of their operation, and&#13;
mitigatory measures can be easily designed during implementation.&#13;
13.   The project will thus develop and expand the professional skills and capacities of the staff&#13;
involved in implementing the project through training. Participants in the training program will include:&#13;
(i) head quarter and field staff from irrigation committee, agriculture, state land committee, and farmers.&#13;
The training will comprise: (a) one annual course of one week duration with a purpose to upgrade&#13;
existing knowledge and to introduce new concepts about environmentally sustainable agriculture,&#13;
including irrigation and drainage; (b) short courses, seminars, and study tours to be offered by national&#13;
institutions; (c) a series of one-day seminars on various aspects of environmental management,&#13;
monitoring, EIAs, water management, maintenance, problem solving, etc.; (d) field days for farmers.&#13;
These would promote modern on-farm irrigation and drainage technologies and increase farmers&#13;
awareness of environmentally sustainable good water and best farm and land management practices. Field&#13;
days will be organized by the RIUs. Maximum use will be made of the international experiences and&#13;
lessons learnt elsewhere on environmental management in similar projects, EIA and other relevant manu-&#13;
als.&#13;
14.   The project would support the incremental operational costs. Government's commitment is sought&#13;
for allocation of necessary budget that will be made available to the Department of Agriculture and State&#13;
Committee for Ecology and Natural Resource Utilization for meeting such needs. A review of the&#13;
Government program which addresses the enviromnental concerns of the project would be made during&#13;
project implementation by IDA/IFAD missions. The Participating Commercial Bank will follow the&#13;
Environmental Assessment Procedures as suggested in the note enclosed to this report.&#13;

II. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCEDURES&#13;
15.   This note is intended to provide guidelines to the participating commercial banks (PCBs) in&#13;
reviewing and appraising credits/loans so that the project can be implemented in an environmentally sound&#13;
manner. The procedures and requirements described herein are designed specifically for implementation&#13;
by the PCBs and are independent but parallel to the Azerbaijan Republic's regulatory requirements for&#13;
Environmental Review. Environmental screening will be carried out by the PCBs at an early stage in&#13;
their credit review procedures and may require the contracting of external expertise or the hiring of&#13;
permanent environmental staff. Following screenings will be recommended for identifying the type of&#13;
environmental analysis that will be required. A list of example sub-projects which may fall under each&#13;
defined category is given in Para 18.&#13;
Screening Categories&#13;
16.   Sub-project screening categories are defined as follows, with examples of sub-projects likely to&#13;
be included under each category listed in para 18. The sub-project screening process will be carried out&#13;
by the PCBs environmental expert(s).&#13;
*     Category I (low risk): These would include sub-projects whose environmental impacts are&#13;
expected to be negligible, for which no environmental evaluation would be required. There may&#13;
be opportunities here to incorporate environmental measures which would enhance the sub-project&#13;
through minor (low-cost) modifications in the design without reducing efficiency.&#13;
*     Category II (intermediate risk): These would include sub-projects with impacts that can be&#13;
readily identified and standard preventive and/or remedial measures can be prescribed without&#13;
a full EA. This category also includes projects which may have immediate levels of regular and&#13;
accidental emissions (see Para 18). A limited EA would be recommended in these cases which&#13;
may simply require specifying well-defined mitigating measures and adopting accepted operating&#13;
practices. An environmental assessment would follow a simplified outline of that presented&#13;
herein with relevant sections pertaining to an area outside the potential impact of the sub-project&#13;
omitted (to be determined by the environmental specialist).&#13;
*     Category III (high risk): These would include sub-projects which may have highly significant,&#13;
negative and/or long-term environmental impacts, the magnitude of which are difficult to&#13;
determine at the project identification stage. A full environmental assessment (EA) would be&#13;
prepared by the sub-borrower in parallel with the techno-economic feasibility study of the sub-&#13;
project.&#13;
*     Category IV: Projects which would include the production or use of these materials ( Para 18)&#13;
are normally not financed by international financial institutions.&#13;
17.   During project implementation, IDA/IFAD missions will supervise the overall screening process&#13;
and implementation of environmental recommendations for selected projects. The supervision team will&#13;
also review, ad-hoc, environmental documentation. Therefore, all this documentation should be kept on&#13;
file with PCBs and forwarded to the PMU as needed.&#13;

Environmental Assessment Categories for lending by Participating Commercial Banks&#13;
18.   The following examples of sub-projects and their suggested categorization are indicative only and&#13;
will need to be reviewed throughout Project Implementation to assess their appropriateness concerning&#13;
the types of sub-projects which are actually submitted to the participating commercial banks (PCBs). As&#13;
it would be impossible for this list to be exhaustive, sub-projects which cannot be identified as belonging&#13;
to one of the categories below should be brought to the attention of the Borrower to transmit to the World&#13;
Bank for further guidance.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC&#13;
FARM PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX F&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    Crop budgets for the major crops and livestock activities.were developed to evaluate financial and&#13;
economic viability. The main crops analyzed were winter wheat, barley, cotton, corn for grain, forage&#13;
crop, fruits (apples), eggplant and onions. The analysis was carried out under two cases; first using the&#13;
current input-output technical coefficients and productivity levels - representing the "Without Project&#13;
Situation" and second; under improved technological practices with improved input-output relationships&#13;
and higher productivity levels - representing the "With Project Situation". The current market prices&#13;
for all inputs and outputs were used to evaluate financial viability in both the cases.&#13;
(i)    Without Project Situation: The first case reflects the present status of crop profitability.&#13;
It shows that the gross margins of the cereal crops, even though positive, are not&#13;
significant enough to justify new investments unless their operations are restructured and&#13;
productivity increases are obtained. The gross margins per hectare for wheat, barley,&#13;
corn for grain and forage crops are in a range between US$47 to US$146 per hectare.&#13;
Cotton returns are about US$263 per hectare. Vegetables provide the maximum margins&#13;
of over US$3500 per hectare. The low margins of cereal crops are due to low input use,&#13;
obsolete technological practices and distortions in relative input-output prices.&#13;
Productivity, in terms of yields per hectare is low, especially given the high potential of&#13;
increasing the yields by 50 to 100 percent for most of the crops. In the case of dairy&#13;
operations, the gross margins are US$153 per cow. This low return is due to poor&#13;
quality feed - which is low in protein, lack of vitamins, poor livestock management and&#13;
low hygienic standards;&#13;
(ii)    With Project Situation:  The second case analyzes the returns under improved&#13;
conditions, with better and timely use of inputs, more efficient use of water resources&#13;
(implied through water charges and formation of water users association), lower&#13;
harvesting and transport losses and better quality products. Under this likely scenario,&#13;
which is possible under a privatized system of farm operations, the gross margins per&#13;
hectare for all the cereal crops are found to increase from 100 to 300 percent and by&#13;
about 75 percent in the case of fruits and vegetables. Higher productivity and increase&#13;
in gross returns of more than 400 percent could be achieved in dairy operations through&#13;
investments in improved feeds, timely veterinary services and better management; and&#13;
(iii)   Economic Analysis: The following were the main assumptions used:&#13;
(a)    Tradeable outputs. All tradable goods, such as fertilizers, chemicals and other&#13;
imported inputs have been priced at import parity ex-farm gate prices. These&#13;
have been derived from the prevailing and projected world market prices (World&#13;
Bank projections). In the case of fuel and energy, since Azerbaijan is a producer&#13;
and exporter, the export parity prices have been used. In the case of tradeable&#13;
outputs, such as wheat and maize, import parity prices have been used and export&#13;
parity prices in the case of cotton have been used. These prices have been&#13;
presented in Table 3. All calculations have been carried out in constant 1996&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                                ANNEX F&#13;
US$ using the G-5 manufacturing unit value indices for conversion from current&#13;
price projections to constant 1996 values. Appreciation of the manat vis-a-vis the&#13;
dollar has been assumed in line with the projections made by the World Bank;&#13;
and&#13;
(b)    The policy reforms being pursued by the Govermnent are expected to restore the&#13;
incentive structure in agriculture, thereby having a positive impact on agricultural&#13;
productivity. The rate of increase in crop yields, however, is expected to be&#13;
slow as compared to the with project situation; full development, without the&#13;
project is expected to occur in year 15 as compared to year 5 with the project.&#13;
The difference is accounted for by the slower process of privatization and&#13;
ownership and slower development of post privatization assistance. The period&#13;
of analysis is for fifteen years of project operation.&#13;
2.    3 Ha Crop and Dairy Farm Model. The above assumptions have been used in the financial and&#13;
economic analysis of a 3 ha crop and diary farm model which is presented in Table 4.&#13;

FARM PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX G&#13;
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. THE TARGET GROUP&#13;
1.    Due to the collapse of the centrally managed system of production, trading blockage, unsold&#13;
products, unpaid salaries, most of the farm population in the project raions including people with working&#13;
capacity are going through an economic crisis. The main problem of majority of population in the project&#13;
farms is to find new ways of generating income both in the farm and outside. To identify the target&#13;
group for this proposed project, the population in all the project farms can broadly be divided into the&#13;
following two broad categories: (i) people with low or no working capacity; and (ii) people with working&#13;
capacity. Tables 1 and 2 provide details of these two categories by farms.&#13;
2.    The first category includes handicapped people, invalids, elderly living alone, single parent&#13;
families, and pensioners. The total size of these groups is between 15 and 46 percent of the total farrn&#13;
population. These groups are permnanently in need of assistance (welfare). The land privatization process&#13;
is expected to legally protect these groups by allowing the use of land as a source of income through&#13;
leasing. At the conmmunity level, these groups may also be supported through social safety networks.&#13;

3.    The second category includes people with working ability (people between ages 16-60, and able&#13;
bodies). The total size of this group is between 55 and 62 percent of the total farm population (see Table&#13;
1). During this transition, budgetary constraints, lack of new skills required in a market economy, lack&#13;
of markets, access to credit have adversely affected this group of people with working capacity.&#13;

* The number of unpaid farm workers = number of farm workers.&#13;
4.    Out of the total population with working capacity, the declared unemployed people and unpaid&#13;
farm workers' are presently in need of finding productive employment and to generate income to support&#13;
themselves and their families (see Table 2). The total size of these groups (declared unemployed and&#13;
unpaid farm workers) is between 18 and 48 percent of the total farm population.&#13;
Causes of Poverty&#13;
5.    The major causes of poverty in the project farms are: (i) lack of alternative sources of&#13;
employment, particularly outside agriculture; (ii) underdeveloped basic community services (e.g. piped&#13;
drinking water supply, gas supply for heating etc.); (iii) lack of inputs and technical advice for&#13;
improved/profitable crop and livestock production; (iv) availability of credit for agriculture and local&#13;
enterprises; (v) lack of technical knowledge and skills for creation and management of non-farm&#13;
enterprises; (vi) inadequate marketing facilities; (vii) trading blockage and border conflicts; (viii) lack of&#13;
community based organizations or self help groups; (ix) unpaid salaries for workers, and late (and low)&#13;
payment of pensions; (x) high inflation rate; (xi) limited amount of arable land in some cases (e.g. in&#13;
Narimanov Farm); and (xii) farm population contains significant percentage (15-28 percent) of people&#13;
Since all farm workers have not been paid their salaries, the number of unpaid farm workers equals the&#13;
number of farm workers.&#13;

B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
6.    The primary objective of the Community Development component is to support suitable&#13;
mechanisms for people based community development activities and strengthen local groups to take an&#13;
active part in the land privatization and farm restructuring process. Specifically, this component will&#13;
support activities that will: (i) ensure that the privatization process is used as an opportunity to increase&#13;
involvement of the population and that the land distribution process takes place equitably; (ii) assist the&#13;
people of the villages and target group members to establish confidence in their ability to manage their&#13;
own affairs at the community level; (iii) provide support to critical community infrastructure through&#13;
rehabilitation; in particular domestic water supplies and small social infrastructure which could be&#13;
sustained by the community; and (iv) lay the basis for the sustainable development of off-farm small scale&#13;
enterprises in the project area.&#13;
C. STRATEGY&#13;
7.    The strategy of this component is to actively involve the ordinary village population and provide&#13;
them with sufficient knowledge and training in order to: (a) develop their ability and confidence in&#13;
participatory community activities through  encouraging members' participation in planning and&#13;
implementing community initiatives; (b) take an active role in the process of privatization and ensure that&#13;
their interests as individuals and groups are given due consideration through assuring a demand-driven&#13;
approach in the identification, assessment and selection of community initiatives; (c) initiate and manage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81-                                  ANNEX G&#13;
community level activities and investments through improving their capacity to implement and monitor&#13;
community initiatives; and (d) diversify income sources and increase employment alternatives through&#13;
the development of off-farm small-scale enterprises.&#13;
8.     The component would assist in the development of a community based approach to problems&#13;
which can be dealt with and sustained at the village level and which will not require further involvement&#13;
of national institutions. Priority would be given to meeting women's needs. Applications from women&#13;
for training in technical, business and marketing skills as well as for credit would be given first priority,&#13;
and carefully monitored.&#13;
D. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
9.     This component consists of four major activities: (i) mass information campaign on the&#13;
privatization process; (ii) development of local capacities in participatory community development; (iii)&#13;
rehabilitation of critical community infrastructure; and (iv) creation of new types of employment&#13;
opportunities in the project area.&#13;
(i)    Information Campaign: This component would initiate and operate a mass information&#13;
campaign in each village of the project raions. This information campaign would involve:&#13;
(a) an information campaign to the beneficiaries on the status of the privatization as well&#13;
as the procedures and options available; and (b) organization of public meetings for the&#13;
discussion of privatization procedures in each village.&#13;
(ii)    Development of Local Capacities in Participatory Community Development: Once the&#13;
privatization is underway and the community members have been informed, activities that&#13;
would speed up the involvement of people in the privatization process and development&#13;
of local capacities in community development would be undertaken. These would consist&#13;
of: (a) introduction of participatory planning processes to enable communities to state&#13;
their needs and priorities, and to enable Community Development Workers and other&#13;
project staff to translate these needs and priority into coherent community plans; (b)&#13;
identification and selection of the community level organizers who would be responsible&#13;
for coordinating community activities; (c) providing community level organizers and&#13;
community members with the training required to be able to effectively facilitate such&#13;
processes; and (d) strengthening the ability of communities to select, implement and&#13;
manage community initiatives.&#13;
(iii)   Rehabilitation of Critical Community Infrastructure: The project would support the&#13;
rehabilitation of critical community infrastructure in the project farms. Reliable domestic&#13;
water supply has been found to be a pressing need in most of the project farms,&#13;
especially in Gulaband and Hatai farms2 in Udjar raion..&#13;
2 Supply pipelines exist but need rehabilitation of about 1 km. The distribution point for three&#13;
villages is located next to the offices of Hatai farm, which is also in need of repair and replacement of&#13;
some equipment. Some new parts of the village are not connected by the pipeline system, which need&#13;
to be extended by about 1 km. Additional pumps would need to be installed. There are currently no&#13;
house connections. The system is also turned off due to considerable debts by the farms which were&#13;
responsible for paying the bills until recently. Similar interventions could be planned later for other&#13;
communities. In Gilinjili where water is supplied from four unequipped artisan wells (3 free flowing and&#13;
one with pump-set), an entirely autonomous community level user's organization for water management&#13;
could be developed and the wells equipped with basic facilities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                                 ANNEX G&#13;
10.    The rehabilitation of the system would require the willingness of members of the community to&#13;
organize themselves into a user's group to take over the responsibility of future operation and&#13;
maintenance of the system, through collection of water charges3. The formation of user's group would&#13;
be promoted and guided by the community organiser. The project would provide for the necessary&#13;
training of leaders. The formation of such user groups would be initiated in Gilinjili and if successful,&#13;
would be replicated to other villages in the five project farms where development of village level water&#13;
supply systems are technically feasible and financially within the possibilities of the project. It is estimated&#13;
that some eight villages would have the potential of having an independent village based domestic water&#13;
supply systems.&#13;
11.    To help communities in the development of community initiatives, such as purchase of materials&#13;
for construction or rehabilitation of health post, kindergarten, construction of community centers or other&#13;
community facility, purchase of milling machines for use by an entire community or other equipment or&#13;
community facilities, repair of sports facility, etc. each village would have access to loans provided by&#13;
the project which would be used to finance selected aspects of community initiatives. Loans will be&#13;
made by Agroprombank and only a one-time capital grant up to 50 percent of the total capital required&#13;
for commercially viable activities and the remaining balance of 50 percent would be provided as a term&#13;
credit to the beneficiaries. These loans could be spent on one or more community initiatives.&#13;
12.    The basic criteria for approval of funds would be:&#13;
e      existing social services and infrastructure networks;&#13;
*      supply some input or skill not available locally;&#13;
=      the initiative should benefit the community as a whole or a group of vulnerable people&#13;
and contribute to the improvement in social welfare;&#13;
*      willingness of the community to adopt a participatory approach;&#13;
*      contain a sufficient gender mix to meet component objectives;&#13;
*      initiative would be operated and maintained by the community itself after the initial&#13;
investment;&#13;
*      ability to handle the financial payment associated with the initiative as established by the&#13;
credit program; and&#13;
*      have adequate extension support.&#13;
13.    The community would participate through its contribution of management, design, labour and&#13;
other inputs available locally. In the early stages when the communities lack investment capital, it is&#13;
essential that the project provide some material input as a form of encouragement.&#13;
14.   Implementation of related social infrastructure would involve appraisal of costs, engineering&#13;
design and contracting mechanisms by the technicians from specialized agencies, component and NGO&#13;
staff. In order to avoid complication of the involvement of different government agencies in the project,&#13;
it is most likely that construction for water supply and other social infrastructures would be contracted&#13;
to NGOs or the private sector.&#13;
The emergence of private farmers provides an opportunity to assume the responsibility for overall&#13;
water management of their respective farms. The water user's association would be formed through a&#13;
participatory process as planned for the rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(iv)    Creation of Employment Opportunities and Training:&#13;
15.    The conmmunity development component would support the creation of business centers, would&#13;
encourage and assist the development of small- and medium-scale enterprises. The business centers would&#13;
provide training and advisory services to individuals or groups of people who want to establish viable&#13;
business either as individuals or in groups, and whose business proposal has been carefully examined by&#13;
the project to ensure its feasibility from technical, financial and economic points of view. The likely&#13;
skills to be developed in each of the farm population have been presented in Table 4.&#13;
Table 4: Likely Skills to be Developed&#13;
Farm                                     Skills to be Developed&#13;
Ghilinjili            * Sewing and knitting&#13;
* Improved farming techniques (as 76 % of the work force is engaged in&#13;
agriculture)&#13;
* Food processing&#13;
* Electricity repair &amp; maintenance&#13;
* Basic accounting &amp; marketing&#13;
Gulaband &amp; Hatai      * Cotton processing &amp; manufacturing (small-scale) of cotton products&#13;
* Food (vegetable and fruits) processing&#13;
* Wood working (e.g. furniture making)&#13;
* Basic accounting &amp; marketing&#13;
Narimanov             * Food (fruits &amp; vegetables) processing&#13;
* Tea processing &amp; packaging&#13;
* Sewing &amp; knitting&#13;
* Milk processing (e.g. hard cheese making for export)&#13;
* Baking ( some women have already initiated cake &amp; bread making)&#13;
* Repair &amp; maintenance of machineries and equipments&#13;
* Basic accounting and marketing&#13;
Yergouz               * Food processing&#13;
* Poultry farming (as people already have basic know how)&#13;
* Wood working (window frame &amp; furniture making)&#13;
* Repair &amp; maintenance of machines &amp; equipments&#13;
* Basic accounting &amp; marketing&#13;
Shafag                * Cotton processing and manufacturing (small-scale) of cotton products&#13;
* Wood working&#13;
* Repair &amp; maintenance of machines, equipments&#13;
* Poultry farming&#13;
* Basic accounting &amp; marketing&#13;
16.    The types of businesses which could merit support would be sewing and knitting, small scale food&#13;
processing, plumbing, electricity, machinery services, etc. In the project area, there is considerable&#13;
interest in the development of certain types of traditional economic activities carried out by women, such&#13;
as carpet making, knitting and sewing, milk processing, grainmills, development of fish in ponds, or food&#13;
processing which can range from small scale preserves to larger scale canning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                               ANNEX G&#13;
17.   The business centers would provide support and assistance to women and men interested in&#13;
diversifying income sources through starting small- and medium-scale off-farm activities. Each of the&#13;
centers would be staffed by a Business Adviser, who would be recruited and trained by the project.&#13;
Business centers in the project raions would be established.&#13;
18.   These Business Centers, through its Business Advisers, would play an instrumental role in: (a)&#13;
provision of basic information services on the operation and management of small businesses; (b)&#13;
identification of training needs at local level; (c) organization of training sessions locally when sufficient&#13;
demand is reached, for either technical or managerial aspects; (d) addressing people to the right&#13;
specialized agencies for advice; (e) assisting people in establishing recognized manufacturing or trading&#13;
companies, cooperatives or other institutions; (f) assisting people in preparing proposals for start-up credit&#13;
for new enterprises; and (g) supporting new enterprises and providing advisory services.&#13;
E. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
19.   The implementation of this pilot operation will be carried out with the assistance of an&#13;
International Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with demonstrated sound knowledge and&#13;
experience in carrying out the required activities. The Community Development Officer, under the&#13;
supervision of the Project Management Unit, would be responsible for the coordination of the&#13;
component staff and activities, as well as for liaison and coordination with the NGO. NGO and the&#13;
PMU would sign a Memorandum of Understanding or an agreement. The participation of the NGO&#13;
in the project would be governed by this agreement and would describe the activities of the NGO in the&#13;
organization and supervision of communities activities, provision of training and technical assistance&#13;
roles, responsibilities and authority. It will also include the definition of the operational arrangements,&#13;
required inputs and expected outputs of their participation in the implementation of the community&#13;
development component.&#13;
F. MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
20.   The component would be monitored at two levels: first, by the PMU and the M&amp;E Officer and&#13;
second, by the Agroprombank for those activities related to the credit program.&#13;
21.   The qualitative nature of this component makes it difficult to establish a quantifiable monitoring&#13;
indicators. Some of these indicators are the following:&#13;
*     The manner in which the Business Centers functions;&#13;
*     The CDWs degree of success in mobilizing support from the community;&#13;
*     The degree to which community members know about the project;&#13;
*     Level of participation of women and youth in project activities;&#13;
*     Beneficiary perception of project ownership;&#13;
*     The degree to which beneficiaries' needs/requirements are addressed by the CDWs and&#13;
NGO staff;&#13;
*     The degree to which the component has contributed to beneficiaries' utilization of credit&#13;
for income generating activities and minor community infrastructure and other&#13;
community initiatives; and&#13;
*     Views of non-participants of the project and the component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                               ANNEX G&#13;
Some of these indicators could be converted to quantitative measures, for example:&#13;
*     Number of queries, membership and types of training courses;&#13;
*     All participants in all projects activities recorded by gender;&#13;
*     Credit applications and approval recorded by gender;&#13;
*     Minor community infrastructures financed by the project by type of infrastructure;&#13;
*     Credit applications for community development initiatives and business development&#13;
and approvals by gender;&#13;
*     Training requests;&#13;
*     Enterprises started by type and gender;&#13;
*     Attendance at meetings and interest in the component's activities;&#13;
*     Regular enquiries among the concerned populations, including non-participants; and&#13;
*     Others.&#13;
The above list of indicators is an indicative one. Appropriate monitoring and evaluation&#13;
indicators will be developed to suit the specific needs of the component during project implementation.&#13;

            Azerbaijan - Farm Privatization Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Farm
            Privatization Project (FPP) is to accelerate the
            Government's program for land privatization and farm
            restructuring of representative state and collective farms
            in a systematic manner and to provide models which could
            serve as a basis for wider geographical replicability.  This
            objective will be achieved by providing: (1) essential
            support services necessary to sustain privatized agriculture
            at the raion and farm levels.  These are: land registration,
            farm information and advisory services, credit services, and
            rehabilitation of critical irrigation and drainage
            infrastructure; (2) an enabling environment which will build
            linkages between key institutions, viz., the Ministry of
            Agriculture, the State Land Committee, the State Irrigation
            Committee, Agrarian Reform Commissions and agricultural
            banking institutions; and (3) a community based social
            services and formation of village groups in support of land
            privatization and farm restructuring.  The project will
            consist of four components to be implemented over a period
            of five years.  These are: (1) farm privatization support
            services at the national level and in the raions; (2)
            rehabilitation of the main irrigation water supply and
            drainage works; and (3) a community development program; and
            (4) project management and implementation.
