Foreword&#13;
The past year brought the first sigigs of recovery from the financial crisis that swept the globe in&#13;
1997. It also brought a stronger and more focused comiittiment to reducing poverty in the world.&#13;
These are both encouraging signs. Economic growth provides the resources needed to improve peo-&#13;
ple's lives-creating new jobs, increasing productivity, and producing goods and services. But only&#13;
growth with equLity-growth that reaches the poor can close the gap betweeii the rici anid the poor.&#13;
Low income is just one of poverty's many dimensions. The poor lack material goods, education,&#13;
medical care, and information. They also lack security and the means to protect their families.&#13;
And they suffer the indignity of being displaced and dispossessed. even in their own comnimuni-&#13;
ties. So we cannot look for a single solution to poverty. Nor can we measure poverty by just one&#13;
indicator. We must look at a range of indicators.&#13;
That is why the Development Assistance Commiiittee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation&#13;
and Development (OECD) in 1996 selected seven international development goals from the res-&#13;
olutions of UN conferences. Then, in 1998 a joint meeting of the UN, the OECD, and the World&#13;
Bank proposed 21 indicators to track progress toward those goals.&#13;
This year's World Developmnent Indicators tells us that achieving those goals will be difficult but&#13;
still attainable in many countries. Progress in reducing poverty rates stalled, especially in Asia,&#13;
as a consequence of the financial crisis. and in Europe and Central Asia income distributions wors&#13;
ened. Even so. the goal of reducing poverty rates to half of their 1990 levels can still be achieved&#13;
in most regions. if growth resumes without further increases in inequality.&#13;
Looking at other social indicators, we find that many countries will achieve equal school enroll-&#13;
ments for girls and boys in the next five years. Overall, we may fall short of the goal, but the progress&#13;
toward it will bring benefits that extend beyond the classroom to all society. Reaching full priiiary&#13;
school enrolmenit in the next 15 years will be more difficult. It now appears that 75 millioni cliil-&#13;
dren will be out of school in 2015, two-thirds of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even harder will be&#13;
reducing child mortality to two-thirds of its 1990 level by 2015. Only 13 countries are on track.&#13;
Some are falling back. But many more could achieve this goal by increasing health services for&#13;
the poor and stemmirig the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&#13;
These are only some of the enormous challenges we face in eliminating poverty-challenges we can&#13;
begin to address only with knowledge. with energy, and with resolve. The beginning point is knowledge-&#13;
knowledge of how far we have come and how far we have to go. And that is the purpose of the World&#13;
Development Indicators. which we are pleased to offer now in its fourth year of publication.&#13;

This book and its companion volumes, the World Bank Atlas and the Little Data Book, were pre-&#13;
pared by a team led by Eric Swanson. The team consisted of Swaminathan Aiyar, Mehdi Akhlaghi,&#13;
David Cieslikowski, Richard Fix, Amy Heyman, Masako Hiraga, M. H. Saeed Ordoubadi, Sulekha&#13;
Patel, K. M. Vijayalakshmi, Amy Wilson, and Estela Zamora, working closely with other teams in&#13;
the Development Economics Vice Presidency's Development Data Group. The CD-ROM development&#13;
team included Azita Amjadi, Elizabeth Crayford, Reza Farivari, Angelo Kostopoulos, and William Prince.&#13;
K. Sarwar Lateef served as adviser to the team and provided substantial inputs. The work was car-&#13;
ried out under the management of Shaida Badiee.&#13;
The choice of indicators and textual content was shaped through close consultation with and&#13;
substantial contributions from staff in the World Bank's four thematic networks-Environmentally&#13;
and Socially Sustainable Development; Finance, Private Sector, and Infrastructure; Human Devel-&#13;
opment; and Poverty Reduction and Economic Management-and staff of the International Finance&#13;
Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. Most important, we received sub-&#13;
stantial help, guidance, and data from our external partners. For individual acknowledgments of&#13;
contributions to the book's content, please see the Credits section. For a listing of our key part-&#13;

Preface&#13;
S    Statistics are thought to be dry and narrow. The aim of the World Development Indicators is to&#13;
make them lively and comprehensive-to paint a picture of the world and its peoples. The num-&#13;
bers in this book tell us that people in most places are living longer, but that in countries gripped&#13;
by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, life expectancies are going down. Average incomes continue to rise for&#13;
most developing countries, but some of the poorest have slipped backward, subjecting millions&#13;
more to extreme poverty. We can also see that the developing countries are becoming more impor-&#13;
tant participants in the global economy. But the picture is flawed, and those flaws arise from the&#13;
data: too often they are incomplete or unreliable or entirely unavailable.&#13;
Why do statistics matter? Put sirnply, they are the evidence on which policies are built. They help&#13;
to identify needs, set goals, and mor itor progress. Without good statistics, the development process&#13;
is blind-policymakers cannot learn from their mistakes, and the public cannot hold them accountable.&#13;
The World Bank's new poverty reductior strategy process calls for a country-driven, outcome-based approach&#13;
to reducing poverty, and that approach depends on publicly accessible and reliable statistics.&#13;
Why are good statistics so hard to obtain? A cyc e of underfunding has left many statistical&#13;
agencies without the resources to carry out their tasks. Often the value of good statistics goes&#13;
unappreciated. In some cases politicians, government agencies, and civil society-failing to&#13;
understand their role in policymaking and democratic decisionmaking-fail to ask for the information&#13;
they need. In other cases the demand for immediate answers leads to short-term responses-&#13;
quick surveys and guesstimates-that take resources away from long-term development of the&#13;
statistical system. Added to this, statisticians in developing countries need better training, better&#13;
equipment, and better treatment tc carry out the important work they are charged with.&#13;
Recognizing the many flaws in the statistical system and the need to address them directly by&#13;
improving the capacity of countries tco produce statistics, a consortium of more than 90 countries and&#13;
international organizations has come! together under the banner of Partnership in Statistics for Devel-&#13;
opment in the 21st Century, or Paris2l. The aim of Paris2l is to raise awareness of the value of good&#13;
statistics-and to increase the resources for statistical capacity buLilding in developing countries. The&#13;
World Bank, as a member of Paris2:L, has pledged to work closely with all its development partners&#13;
in this effort. Although the process of building strong statistical systems is slow, we hope that future&#13;
editions of the World Development Indicators will reflect the new work that we embark on today.&#13;
As we work together toward im )rovements, we continue to be grateful for the support and co-&#13;
operation of our many partners-the international organizations, statistical offices, nongovernmental&#13;
organizations, and private firms that have provided their data and contributed to this product. We&#13;
also appreciate the comments and responses from users-helping us measure how we are doing&#13;
in continuing to make the World Development Indicators a useful tool. So please write to us at&#13;

Defining, gathering, and disseminating international statistics is a collective effort of many peo-&#13;
ple and organizations. The indicators presented in the World Development Indicators are the fruit&#13;
of decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who administer censuses and house-&#13;
hold surveys to the committees and working parties of the national and international statistical&#13;
agencies that develop the nomenclature, classifications, and standards fundamental to an inter-&#13;
national statistical system. Nongovernmental organizations and the private sector have also made&#13;
important contributions, both in gathering primary data and in organizing and publishing their results.&#13;
And academic researchers have played a crucial role in developing statistical methods and car-&#13;
rying on a continuing dialogue about the quality and interpretation of statistical indicators. All these&#13;
contributors have a strong belief that available, accurate data will improve the quality of public&#13;
and private decisionmaking.&#13;
The organizations listed here have made the World Development Indicators possible by shar-&#13;
ing their data and their expertise with us. More important, their collaboration contributes to the&#13;
World Bank's efforts, and to those of many others, to improve the quality of life of the world's&#13;
people. We acknowledge our debt and gratitude to all who have helped to build a base of com-&#13;
prehensive, quantitative information about the world and its people.&#13;

lhe World Bank's classification of economies&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World&#13;
Bank's main criterion for classifying economies is                                       2.4&#13;
gross national product (GNP) per capita. Every econ-&#13;
omy is classified as low income, middle income (sub-                                                  wLIt,,               I,,,,,'3&#13;
divided into lower middle and upper middle), or high&#13;
income. For income classifications see the map on                                                         FZ&#13;

A sixth of the world's people produce 78 percent of its goods and services&#13;
and receive 78 percent of world income-an average of $70 a day. Three-fifths&#13;
of the world's people in the poorest 61 countries receive 6 percent of the&#13;
world's income-less than $2 a day. But their poverty goes beyond income. While&#13;
7 of every 1,000 children die before age five in high-income countries, more&#13;
than 90 die in low-income countries. How do we bridge these huge and grow-&#13;
ing income gaps, matched by similar gaps in social living standards? Can the&#13;
nations of the world work together to reduce the numbers in extreme poverty?&#13;
This is the fundamental challenge of the 21st century.&#13;
Recent trends in poverty&#13;
New data from the World Bank suggest that the number of people in extreme&#13;
poverty (living on less than $1 a day) has been relatively stable in the past&#13;
decade, rising in the early 1990s to a peak of 1.3 billion and then falling slightly&#13;
to 1.2 billion in 1998-roughly the same as in 1987 (table 1 a) .' But the regional&#13;
picture is varied. In East Asia and the Pacific the number in poverty fell sharply&#13;
from 452 million in 1990 to 278 million in 1998, mainly because of progress in&#13;
China, with thc rest of East Asia cutting its numbers by a third. Almost all other&#13;
regions had their number in poverty increase. South Asia's rose from 495 mil-&#13;
lion to 522 million, and Sub-Saharan Africa's from 242 million to 291 million.&#13;
The proportion of people living in extreme poverty-the poverty rate-went&#13;
down modestly from 29 percent in 1990 to 24 percent in 1998. Here again East&#13;
Asia took the lead, reducing its rate from 28 percent to 15 percent. South Asia, home&#13;
to the largest number of the world's poor, saw a modest decline of four points to&#13;
40 percent over the same period. Sub-Saharan Africa (46 percent) and Latin&#13;
America and the Caribbean (16 percent) had barely discernible reductions.&#13;
Some regional trends:&#13;
* While the overall trend in East Asia and the Pacific is impressive, much of&#13;
this gain was made before 1997. The financial crisis of 1997-98 checked the&#13;
strong momentum of growth. Data from national surveys, based on national&#13;
poverty lines, suggest that Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand&#13;
had sharp increases in poverty. VTietnam seemed the exception-its poverty&#13;
continued to decline. In China, where growth slowed but was still high, the&#13;
pace of poverty reduction slowed sharply after 1996, and the numbers in&#13;
poverty may even have increased.&#13;

Note: Theestimates in thetable are based on datafromthecountries in each regionforwhich at leastonesurveywas available in 1985-98. Where surveyyears do rotcoincidewith the&#13;
years in the table, the survey estimates were adjusted usingthe closest available survey for each country and applyingthe consumption growth rate from national accounts. The number&#13;
of poor in each region wasthenestimated usingthe assumption thatthe sample ofcountries covered by surveys is representative ofthe region as awhole. This assumption is obviously&#13;
less robust in the regions with the lowest surveycoverage. The headcount index is the percentage of the population below the poverty line. Formore details on the data and methodology&#13;

This consensus is based on general agreement that:&#13;
&#149;   Multidimensional societal transformation is the ultimate goal&#13;
of development.&#13;
*   We need to ensure that such transformation is country led&#13;
rather than donor led.&#13;
&#149;   We need to work together through strategic partnerships to&#13;
support countries anxious to move ahead.&#13;
*   We need to focus such efforts on a clear set of monitorable&#13;
development outcomes.&#13;
Building on this consensus, the annual meetings of the World&#13;
Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C.,&#13;
in September 1999 set two priorities for action. First, greatly&#13;
expand the debt relief granted to reforming heavily indebted&#13;
poor countries and link such relief to their efforts to reduce&#13;
poverty. Second, help indebted countries and all other recipients&#13;
of concessional aid develop clearly articulated poverty reduction&#13;
strategies in close consultation with civil society and their devel-&#13;
opment partners.&#13;
Such strategies would:&#13;
*   Aim   at a better understanding of the nature and locus of&#13;
poverty.&#13;
*   Identify and implement public policies that have the greatest&#13;
impact on poverty.&#13;
*   Set clear goals for progress in poverty reduction, tracked in a&#13;
participatory manner through carefully selected intermediate&#13;
and outcome indicators.&#13;
Early candidates for this approach would be the heavily&#13;
indebted poor countries pursuing policy and institutional reforms,&#13;

The challenge of meeting our goals&#13;
I believe that the greal:est moral challenge we face is the fact that&#13;
one in four of the people with whom we share this small and beautiful&#13;
planet live in abject poverty. I also believe that we live at a time&#13;
when it is possible to inake massive reductions in poverty. But to do&#13;
so, we must turn the development efforts of the international&#13;
community from an obsession with inputs and generalized rhetoric&#13;
about poverty to a clear focus on outputs and year-on-year&#13;
effectiveness in reducing poverty measured against our agreed goals&#13;
in each and every country.&#13;

child-rearing.&#13;
Life expectancy has increased for both men and&#13;
women in all regions, but female morbidity and mor-&#13;
tality rates sometimes exceed male rates, particularly&#13;
during early childhood and the reproductive years. In&#13;
high-income countries women tend to outlive men by&#13;
four to eight years on average, while in low-income coun-&#13;
tries the difference is narrower-about two to three&#13;
years. The female disadvantage is best reflected in dif-&#13;
ferences in child mortality rates in some countries.&#13;
Child mortality captures the effect of preferences for&#13;
boys because adequate nutrition and medical inter-&#13;
ventions are particularly important for the age group&#13;
1-5. Because of the natural female biological advan-&#13;
tage, when female child mortality is as high as or higher&#13;
than male child mortality, there is good reason to&#13;
believe that girls are discriminated against.&#13;

The next billion people: who? where?&#13;
No social phenomenon has attracted more attention in the past half century&#13;
than the "population explos-ion"-that surge from about 2.5 billion people in&#13;
1950 to more than 6 billion in 1999, making the 20th century one of unprece-&#13;
dented population growth. As the number of people grew, the interval for&#13;
adding another billion people became shorter and shorter, with the increase&#13;
from 5 billion to 6 billion occurring in only 12 years (figure 2a).&#13;
According to recent projections,l the 7 billion mark will be exceeded in&#13;
2014-the first time since reaching one billion that adding the next billion peo-&#13;
ple is expected to take longer than for the previous billion (box 2a). More than&#13;
half of the next billion will come from South Asia (310 million) and Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa (240 million'. East Asia and the Pacific will add about 220 mil-&#13;
lion, and the remaining 230 million will be divided mostly between the Middle&#13;
East and lNorth Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Europe and Cen-&#13;
tral Asia will add 9 million people-just 1 percent-and the world's high-&#13;
income countries will add 30 million (figure 2b).&#13;
Why the differences? Because of different rates of population growth and&#13;
different base populations. Regions with the same growth rate will add more&#13;
people when the rate is applied to a larger base. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
is growing at a much faster rawe than South Asia, but South Asia will claim a larger&#13;
share of the next billion pecple because of its larger population base.&#13;
The next billion people will also be born into less favorable economic cir-&#13;
cumstances. The majority-just under 600 million-are projected to be in low-&#13;
income countries (as defined in 1999). Middle-income countries will add 375&#13;
million people, most of theni in the lower-middle-income group. Today's high-&#13;
income countries will add a scant 30 million, or 3 percent of the total, in the&#13;
next 15 years (figure 2c).&#13;
And the next billion people will be predominantly urban, concentrated in cities&#13;
and areas of current population settlement, particularly environmentally stressed&#13;
seacoasts and river valleys. During these 15 years the urban population will increase&#13;
from about 47 percent of the total to 54 percent, a net gain of 925 million, mostly&#13;
due to migration from rural tD urban areas and to the urbanization of rural areas.&#13;
Population's momentum in developing countries&#13;
The population growth rate is a key demographic characteristic of a country,&#13;
but the composition of the population by age can have more important con-&#13;
sequences. The age structure determines not only the allocation of resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Projecting the future&#13;
By far the most common methodology for projecting future populations is  recent past. The result: countries that had a fast fertility decline over the&#13;
the cohort component method, used in the projections by the World Bank  past 10 years are projected to maintain a faster than average decline. A&#13;
and by many other international organizations and national statistical  similar assumption is made for changes in mortality: countries in which&#13;

The cohort component method involves first compiling information on  continued mortality decline in the near future. Models-such as model&#13;
the characteristics of a country's population in the starting, or base, year  life tables and model fertility and migration schedules-are used to&#13;
for the projection. The necessary pieces of information consist of   supplement and adjust empirical data.&#13;
estimates of the population by age and sex in the projection's base    Future patterns of vital rates and migration thus play a major role in&#13;

Population and development&#13;
The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development&#13;
(ICPD) held in Cairo adopted a program of action calling for new       1. For summary statistics see tables 2.1 and 2.2. The full set of demog'aphic projections by&#13;

sustainable development. Human development issues-women's&#13;
reproductive health, gender equality, adolescence-are at the core of the&#13;
agreed action plan.&#13;
The conference endorsed an approach to population that&#13;
deemphasizes demographic targets and instead stresses individuals'&#13;
reproductive health rights, such as access to family planning, safe&#13;
pregnancy and delivery, and prevention and treatment of sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases. Sustainable population growth is seen as best&#13;
achieved through individual reproductive choices freely made by women&#13;
and men. The ICPD action plan led to the formulation of several&#13;
indicators and targets that are now core international development goals,&#13;
such as maternal mortality ratios (to be reduced by 75 percent by 2015),&#13;
or that inform other goals, such as access to reproductive health. This&#13;
second group includes universal access to safe and effective&#13;
contraceptive methods, by 2015; a 50 percent reduction in the number&#13;
of people who want to space or limit births but are not using family&#13;
planning, by 2005; and an increase in the presence of skilled attendants&#13;
to 90 percent of all births, by 2015.&#13;
In 1999, five years after the Cairo conference, the United Nations&#13;
reviewed progress by countries in implementing the action program, at an&#13;
ICPD + 5' intergovernmental meeting. Among the achievements noted&#13;
at ICPD + 5 was the widespread acceptance of viewing population as&#13;
more than a demographic concept: population has become recognized as&#13;
part of the development agenda, with governments and nongovernmental&#13;
organizations jointly implementing reproductive health programs.&#13;
Nevertheless, some parts of the action plan were seen as lagging,&#13;
among them the capacity for data collection and analysis. Inadequate&#13;
capacity in many countries is making it difficult to monitor ICPD goals for&#13;
improving reproductive health.&#13;

Most of the increase in the global population over the past five&#13;
decades has occurred in developing countries, and future&#13;
increases are projected to occur in the poorest of them, mainly&#13;
in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Has this rapid population&#13;
growth been good or bad for the economic prospects of these&#13;
countries?&#13;
The links between population growth and poverty are com-&#13;
plex. Evidence suggests that high fertility is as much a symptom&#13;
of poverty as a cause. The poor continue to experience unac-&#13;
ceptably poor reproductive health, including unwanted fertility,&#13;
malnutrition, and high child and maternal mortality rates (box&#13;
2b). While poverty affects all, many of the burdens of poverty weigh&#13;
more heavily on girls and women. In most parts of the develop-&#13;
ing world fewer girls than boys enroll, stay, and learn in school-&#13;
with negative implications for future reductions in fertility and child&#13;
mortality.&#13;
Some of the factors that affect fertility, and thus population&#13;
growth, can be addressed by ensuring that programs in health and&#13;
education are more focused, taking into account the different sit-&#13;
uations and needs of women and men. Since investment in health&#13;
and education is the most widely accepted way of improving the&#13;
asset base of the poor, gender-sensitive investment in human cap-&#13;
ital now not only will improve the environment in which future&#13;

mation method requires fertility, mortality, and net migra-&#13;
tion data, which are often collected from sample surveys,&#13;
some of which may be small or limited in coverage. These&#13;
estimates are the product of demographic modeling and&#13;
so are also susceptible to biases and errors because of&#13;
shortcomings of the model as well as the data. Popula-&#13;
tion projections are made using the cohort component&#13;
method (see box 2a in the introduction to this section).&#13;
The quality and reliability of official demographic data&#13;
are also affected by the public trust in the government,&#13;
the government's commitment to full and accurate enu-&#13;
meration, the confidentiality and protection against mis-&#13;
use accorded to census data, and the independence of&#13;
census agencies from undue political influence.&#13;

on the estimation method for low- and middle-income&#13;

Because the underlying household surveys differ in&#13;
method and in the type of data collected, the distrib-&#13;
ution indicators are not strictly comparable across&#13;
countries. These problems are diminishing as survey&#13;
methods improve and become more standardized, but&#13;
achieving strict comparability is still impossible (see&#13;
About the data for table 2.7).&#13;
The following sources of noncomparability should&#13;
be noted. First, the surveys can differ in many respects,&#13;
including whether they use income or consumption&#13;
expenditure as the living standard indicator. The dis-&#13;
tribution of income is typically more unequal than the&#13;
distribution of consumption. In addition, the definitions&#13;
of income used usually differ among surveys. Con-&#13;
sumption is usually a much better welfare indicator,&#13;
particularly in developing countries. Second, house-&#13;
hold units differ in size (number of members) and in&#13;
extent of income sharing among members. And indi-&#13;
viduals differ in age and consumption needs. Differ-&#13;
ences between countries in these respects may bias&#13;
comparisons of distribution.&#13;
World Bank staff have made an effort to ensure that&#13;
the data are as comparable as possible. Whenever pos-&#13;

Well-trained and motivated teachers are a critical&#13;
input to education, but they come at a cost. Typically, two-&#13;
thirds of education spending goes to teachers' com-&#13;

are defined here as including both ful- and part-time teach-&#13;

of persistence or survival-is estimated as the pro-&#13;
portion of a single-year cohort of stucents that even-&#13;
tually reaches a particular grade of school. It measures&#13;
the holding power and internal efficiency of an education&#13;
system. Progression rates approaching 100 percent indi-&#13;
cate a high level of retention and a low level of dropout.&#13;
Because tracking data for individual students gen-&#13;
erally are not available, aggregate student flows from&#13;
one grade to the next are estmated using data on enroll-&#13;
ment and repetition by grade for two consecutive years.&#13;
This procedure, called the reconstructed cohort method&#13;
(Fredricksen 1993), makes three simplifying assump-&#13;
tions: dropouts never return to school; promotion, rep-&#13;
etition, and dropout rates remain constant over the&#13;
entire period in which the cohort is enrolled in school;&#13;
and the same rates apply to all pupils enrolled in a given&#13;
grade, regardless of whether they previously repeated&#13;
a grade. Given these assumptions, cross-country com-&#13;
parisons should be made with caution, because other&#13;
flows-caused by new entrants, reentrants, grade&#13;
skipping. migration, or school transfers during the&#13;
school year-are not considered.&#13;
The percentage of the cohort reaching grade 5,&#13;
rather than some other grade, is shown because it is&#13;
generally agreed that children who reach grade 5&#13;
should have acquired the basic literacy and numeracy&#13;
skills that would enable them to continue learning. This&#13;
indicator provides no information on learning out-&#13;
comes, however, and only indirectly reflects the qual-&#13;
ity of schooling. Assessing learning outcomes requires&#13;
setting standards and measuring the attainment of&#13;
those standards. In general, national assessments are&#13;
concerned with the performance not of individual stu-&#13;
dents, but of all or part of the education system.&#13;
The repetition rate is often used to indicate the inter-&#13;
nal efficiency of the education system. Repeaters not only&#13;
increase the cost of education for the family and for the&#13;

definition. The illiteracy rate is defined as the per                                         projections.&#13;
centage of people who cannot, with understanding, read&#13;
and write a short, simple statement about their every-&#13;
day life. In practice, illiteracy is difficult to measure.&#13;
To estimate illiteracy using such a definition requires&#13;
census or survey measurements under controlled&#13;
conditions. Many countries estimate the number of illit&#13;
erate people from self-reported data, or by taking&#13;
people with no schooling as illiterate.&#13;
Literacy statistics for most countries cover the pop-&#13;
ulation aged 15 and above, by five-year age groups, but&#13;
some include younger ages or are confined to age&#13;
ranges that tend to inflate literacy rates. As an alter&#13;
native, UNESCO has proposed a narrower age range&#13;
of 15-24, which better captures the ability of partici-&#13;
pants in the formal education system. The youth illit-&#13;
eracy rate reported in the table measures the&#13;
accumulated outcomes of primary education over the&#13;
previous 10 years or so by indicating the proportion&#13;
of people who have passed through the primary edu-&#13;
cation system (or never entered it) without acquiring&#13;
basic literacy and numeracy skills. Reasons for this may&#13;
include difficulties in attending school or dropping out&#13;
before reaching grade 5 (see About the data for table&#13;
2.11) and thereby failing to achieve basic learning&#13;
competencies.&#13;
The indicator expected years of schooling is an esti-&#13;
mate of the total years of schooling that an average child&#13;
at the age of school entry will receive, including years&#13;
spent on repetition, given the current patterns of enroll-&#13;
ment across cycles of education, It may also be inter-&#13;
preted as an indicator of the total education resources,&#13;
measured in school years, that a child will acquire over&#13;
his or her "lifetime" in school-or as an indicator of an&#13;
education system's overall level of development.&#13;

these countries is early childbearing, which is clearly&#13;
incompatible with schooling. Many girls, especially in&#13;
South Asia. still remain outside the formal education&#13;
system. And girls who attend school tend to be directed&#13;
away from science, mathematics, and other technical&#13;
subjects in high demand in the labor market, and&#13;
toward vocations considered "feminine," such as&#13;
nursing, teaching, and clerical work.&#13;
Limited employment opportunities and lower market&#13;
returns for women discourage parents of girls from&#13;
investing in education. Consequently, female partici-&#13;
pation in the labor market is limited, with many women&#13;
concentrated in the informal sector and those in the mod-&#13;
ern sector relegated to the low end of the hierarchy.&#13;
Ensuring that the market is competitive, making labor&#13;
laws gender-neutral, and strengthening the machinery&#13;
that enforces labor laws can improve women's employ-&#13;
ment prospects. Traditionally, teaching has been one&#13;

Rural and urban development can bring relief to more than 1.2 billion poor.&#13;
But only with more attention to the links between development and the envi-&#13;
ronment, including the environment's impact on health and the productive capac-&#13;
ity of natural resources, can development be sustainable.&#13;
More people are using more natural resources than ever, and demand will&#13;
only increase. Food supply needs to double in the next 35 years to satisfy the&#13;
growth of populations and economies. This will happen, to a large extent, at&#13;
the expense of forests, wetlands, and biodiversity. More than a fifth of the&#13;
world's tropical forests have been cleared since 1960, and at least 484 animal&#13;
species and 654 plant species have become extinct since 1600 (Watson and oth-&#13;
ers 1998).&#13;
Water stress and water scarcity affect almost half a billion people; in 25 years&#13;
that number will rise to 3 billion. Without efficient management, existing&#13;
freshwater supply cannot meet the needs of growing populations in many&#13;
countries. Millions of people die every year from contaminated water-almost&#13;
all of them in lowv- and middle-income countries. And the irony is that the poor&#13;
'   pay more than the rich for potable water (World Bank 1999d).&#13;
To balance demand for grDAth and the use of resources and to monitor their&#13;
environmental impact. we need information on how the environment is chang-&#13;
ing and how its degradation affects the poor-in both rural and urban areas.&#13;
But lack of meaningful data with meaningful breakdowns constrains the efforts&#13;
to address the consequences of rural and urban development.&#13;
Rural development should preserve the environment&#13;
Poverty is overwhelmingly rural, with about 70 percent of the poorest people&#13;
in developing countries in rural areas. Although the number and proportion&#13;
of poor people in cities are expected to grow rapidly in the next decades, the&#13;
majority of the poor will continue to live in the countryside. Reducing poverty&#13;
and ending hunger thus requi res more attention to the rural economy and rural&#13;
development.&#13;
Environmental problems affect the poor for several reasons. Dirty water and&#13;
dirty air are major causes of diarrhea and respiratory infections, the two biggest&#13;
killers of poor children. And standing water and accumulated solid waste pro-&#13;
;   mote the transmission of malaria and dengue fever.&#13;

rural and environmental indicators is sparse.&#13;
Another problem: many environmental indicators have little&#13;
meaning at the national level. Some national activities have transna-&#13;
tional consequences, and some environmental issues are highly&#13;
localized and location specific. So in many cases global, regional, or&#13;
rural and ciy indicators are more meaningful than national aggre-&#13;
gates (tables 3.11 and 3.13). Moreover, even on a national level&#13;
many relevant indicators cannot be compiled because adequate or&#13;
comparable data are lacking. And many do not capture depletion&#13;
of natural resources-a serious constraint on measuring the state of&#13;
the environment and designing sound policies.&#13;

Data on water pollution are more readily available&#13;
than other emissions data because most industrial pol-&#13;
lution control programs start by regulating emissions&#13;
of organic water pollutants. Such data are fairly reli-&#13;
able because sampling techniques for measuring&#13;
water pollution are more widely understood and much&#13;
less expensive than those for air pollution.&#13;
In their study Hettige, Mani, and Wheeler (1998)&#13;
used plant- and sector-level information on emissions&#13;

tection agencies and sector-level information on out-&#13;
put and employmentfrom the United Nations Industrial&#13;
Development Organizaton (UNIDO). Their economet-&#13;
ric analysis found that the ratio of BOD to employment&#13;
in each industral sector is about the same across coun-&#13;
tries. This finding allowed the authors to estimate&#13;
BOD loads across countries and over t me. The esti-&#13;
mated BOD intensities per unit of employment were&#13;
multiplied by sectorai employment numbers from&#13;
UNIDO's industry database for 1980-97. The sectoral&#13;
emissions estimates were then totaled to get daily BOD&#13;
emissions in kilograms per day for each country and&#13;
year.&#13;

            This is the fourth annual edition of the
            World Bank's statistical reference. It provides an
            expanded view of the world economy for 148 countries with
            chapters focusing on world view, people, environment,
            economy, states and markets, and global links as well as
            introductions highlighting recent research on major
            development issues. This edition includes some key
            indicators for 1999. This report aims to make statistics
            lively and comprehensive-to paint a picture of the world and
            its people. The numbers in this book tell the reader that
            people in most places are living longer, but that in
            countries gripped by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, life
            expectancies are declining. Average incomes continue to rise
            for most developing countries, but some of the poorest have
            slipped backwards, subjecting millions more to extreme
            poverty. It can also be seen that the developing countries
            are becoming more important participants in the global
            economy. But the picture is flawed because too often the
            data are incomplete or unreliable or entirely unavailable.
            Recognizing the many flaws in the statistical system and the
            need to address them directly by improving the capacity of
            countries to produce statistics, a consortium of more than
            90 countries and international organizations has come
            together and pledged to increase the resources for
            statistical capacity building in developing countries. Hence
            future editions of this report may prove even more useful.
