                               had just been negotiated when in October 1990 the country was&#13;

                               reconciliation and political reform led to a formal cease&#13;

                                         The cease fire has been generally respected , despite&#13;

                               skirmishes along the northern border. Since that date, the&#13;

&#13;
                                           On the economic front, Rwanda had been a good&#13;
&#13;
                              performer in the 1970s when growth averaged 4 percent per&#13;
&#13;
                              year.     However, in the 19805 the authorities pursued inap-&#13;

                              propriate policies to deal with external shocks, especially&#13;
&#13;
                              the decline in the price of coffee, the main foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
                              earner.&#13;
&#13;
                                           By 1990, the incentive structure had become highly&#13;
&#13;
                              distorted with widespread price and foreign exchange controls. i&#13;
&#13;
                              The exchange rate became highly overvalued. These policies&#13;
&#13;
                              led to losses in competitiveness, the development of ineffi-&#13;
&#13;
                              cient economic activities and a decade of steadily declining&#13;
                              per capita income.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The government took a long time to arrive at the&#13;
&#13;
                              conclusion that 'an adjustment program was necessary to&#13;

                              Directors last December.     It will be followed by two other&#13;
&#13;
                              adjustment operations:     a financial sector adjustment credit&#13;
&#13;
                              and an agricultural sector adjustment credit aimed at&#13;
&#13;
                              deepening sector reforms to stimulate a supply response.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The program supported by the proposed credit was&#13;

                              on target. We note that the problem of overvalued exchange&#13;

                                to improve export competitiveness and to reduce the current&#13;
&#13;
                                account deficit.&#13;
&#13;
                                             It is, therefore, of critical importance that the&#13;
&#13;

                                this loan.&#13;
&#13;
                                             It is critical to get control of the fiscal deficit&#13;
&#13;
                                and thereby of domestic indebtedness, especially bank&#13;
&#13;
                                borrowing.&#13;
&#13;
                                             The program establishes a detailed agenda for&#13;
&#13;
                                reducing the deficit, but does not again mention the subject&#13;

                                Does the staff believe that this is an issue requiring&#13;
&#13;
                                further attention?     If so, perhaps additional comments could&#13;
&#13;
                                be made there.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Given the need to improve export competitiveness,&#13;
&#13;
                                we wonder why export taxes are to be retained on coffee. This&#13;
&#13;
                                is referred to on page 6, paragraph 17.&#13;

                                             We applaud the emphasis given to encouragement of&#13;

                                exchange allocation is an interim measure for moving to the&#13;

                                concerned about the government's institutional capacity to&#13;

&#13;
                                       Likewise, the elimination of import restrictions&#13;

&#13;
                            represents important changes which donors are eager to&#13;

                            address this problem.     In the same vein, what measures have&#13;

&#13;
                                             I am fully supportive of this operation. There is,&#13;
&#13;
                               however, one question which is on the basis of reading of&#13;
&#13;
                               Table 1 and Table 3. Maybe it is answered properly but, if it&#13;
&#13;
                               is a dumb question in terms of what Mr. Potter said, it is&#13;
&#13;
                               because   I   have not been able to read the whole thing very&#13;
&#13;
                               carefully.&#13;
&#13;
                                             NOW,   the question was that if you look at -- I&#13;
&#13;
                               couldn't find the terms of trade calculation anywhere, how&#13;
&#13;
                               they have moved. But if one looks at the export volume growth&#13;
.-                             between 1986 and 1990 or so, the export volume has increased&#13;
&#13;
                               by about 36 percent.&#13;
&#13;
                                             But the export receipts have gone down even in&#13;
&#13;
                               nominal terms.        It is a very disastrous situation.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Imports have gone down by 16 percent, but the&#13;
&#13;
                               import payments have more or less remained at the same level&#13;
&#13;
                               as in 1987.&#13;
&#13;
                                             NOW,   under this situation if we are going to have -&#13;
&#13;
                               - obviously, these exports are impoverishing the country&#13;
&#13;
                               almost continuously. And we are going to encourage an export&#13;

                               poor country still more poor.&#13;
&#13;
                                            So, all that we are told here is that the diver-&#13;
&#13;
                               sification program should be done, and there is a timetable&#13;
&#13;
                               which says that by 1991 it will be done.       What is the content&#13;
&#13;
                               of the diversification, what is the role which the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
                               playing in giving them due assistance for diversifying their&#13;
&#13;
                               economy so that they don't really keep on exporting whatever&#13;
&#13;
                               little net wealth they have?&#13;

                                            Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;

&#13;
                               operation.     I think it addresses the main issues facing the&#13;
&#13;
                               country.&#13;
&#13;
                                            I have a couple of comments, one on the health&#13;
&#13;
                               sector. This has been subject to discussion bilaterally with&#13;
&#13;
                               the staff, but I think this is an important area that the&#13;
&#13;
                               authorities should look into, especially, as the report&#13;
&#13;
 -                             indicates, that the country is facing diseases as AIDS and&#13;
&#13;
                               malaria, and some efforts should be given to this sector.&#13;
&#13;
                                            The other is on energy.    I welcome the intention to&#13;

&#13;
                                              I would like to say immediately that we support&#13;
&#13;
                                 obviously without any reservation the document before us&#13;
&#13;
                                 today. And I would like today to limit my comments to the&#13;
&#13;
                                 content of the program, going rather quickly on the macro-&#13;
&#13;
                                 economic framework since less than two months ago we had an&#13;
&#13;
                                 opportunity to discuss the PFP during our meeting of April 23&#13;

&#13;
                                 make only three observations on three traditional subjects:&#13;
&#13;
                                 first, the importance in controlling budgetary expenditures&#13;

                                in this country, which is heavily dependent on external aid;&#13;
&#13;
                                regarding currency to recall our concern of having not only a&#13;
&#13;
                                decrease in the growth of the aggregate but also to have&#13;
&#13;
                                positive interest rates, but this obviously will be part of&#13;
&#13;
                                the structural adjustment loan in financial sector; and&#13;
&#13;
                                finally, regarding the exchange rate, in view of the important&#13;
&#13;
                                devaluation.&#13;
&#13;
                                          A question is raised about the possibility of a&#13;
&#13;
                                consolidation phase since the tables referred to by Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                                Baijal do show that we can have a phase of stabilization of&#13;
&#13;
                                the exchange rate between the Rwandese franc and the dollar.&#13;
&#13;
                                This is compatible with the program before us today.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Therefore, I would like to concentrate my interven-&#13;
&#13;
                                tion on the elements which are relating to the content,&#13;
&#13;
                                first, to welcome the importance granted to the social and&#13;
&#13;
                                population component of the project itself, the project which&#13;
&#13;
                                is next on the agenda under the Special Procedure, which fits&#13;
&#13;
                                perfectly this logic.   We consider as particularly welcome&#13;
&#13;
                                the safety net which will be put in place under this problem.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The second source of satisfaction is also the&#13;
&#13;
 ,--                            emphasis placed in a rather diffused way on the technical&#13;
&#13;
                                assistance to help with the problem of institutional capacity&#13;
&#13;

                             the two points, which is the emphasis placed on the greater&#13;
&#13;
                             flexibility of inputs, particularly the mObility of labor&#13;
&#13;
                             which is one of the components of this program.&#13;
&#13;
                                        The fourth element on which I would like to come&#13;
&#13;
                             back, a question for the staff under the chapter "Reform of&#13;
&#13;
                             the Public Sector" on page 17, it is indicated there that the&#13;
&#13;
                             public enterprises will be part of the privatization program,&#13;
&#13;
                             but nothing is said about what will happen on the exoneration&#13;
&#13;
                             of taxes for this public enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Is this already done or is this part of this&#13;
&#13;
                             program?   Paragraph 55 says nothing on this point, while&#13;
&#13;
                             paragraph 54 talks at length on the disappearance of all the&#13;
&#13;
                             public enterprises, including whether or not they are&#13;
&#13;
                             profitable in the country.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Another comment which I note in paragraph 71, page&#13;
&#13;
                             22 of the document, which traditionally in all adjustment&#13;
&#13;
                             programs indicates the risks of a project and, therefore, I&#13;
&#13;
                             am rather surprised, in fact, in finding in paragraph 71&#13;
&#13;
                             which implicitly involves the will of the authorities of&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
                                         I thought I understood that, if the management was&#13;
&#13;
                              giving us a product, it was convinced of the will of the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                        I support the first structural adjustment program&#13;
&#13;
                           for Rwanda.     It is ambitious and I can only hope that the&#13;
&#13;
                           envisaged growth rates of GOP and exports will be realized.&#13;
&#13;
                           But there is no alternative to structural adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Given the difficult situation in the country and&#13;
&#13;
                           the recent ethnic strife, a careful design of the adjustment&#13;
&#13;
                           credit is very important. The emphasis put on measures to&#13;
&#13;
                           alleviate the negative impact of adjustment on the poorest&#13;
&#13;
                           strata of the society is, therefore, very well taken. This&#13;
&#13;
                           will help to make more sustainable the structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
                           process that Rwanda is embarking upon.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Allow me one observation that I have made before,&#13;
&#13;
                           and that is of some important to Rwanda but also to other&#13;
&#13;
                           countries in the regions. The measures envisaged in the SAL&#13;
&#13;
                           to promote the private sector are necessary indeed. But this&#13;
&#13;
                           might not be enough.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Right now, Rwanda and the neighboring countries are&#13;
&#13;
                           producing more or less the same products. So, the potential&#13;
&#13;
                           of trade in the area is probably rather small.&#13;
&#13;
                                        But with diversification in the long-run there will&#13;
&#13;
                           be a need to export to neighboring countries and, therefore,&#13;
&#13;
                           there might be a case for the Central African Economic&#13;
&#13;
                           Community.     Without open borders to neighboring countries,&#13;

&#13;
                                   population project that is on our agenda under Special&#13;
&#13;
                                   Procedure.     Reading this document really made clear to me how&#13;
&#13;
                                   important a successful population policy is for Rwanda.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Without putting a cap on population growth, all the adjustment&#13;
&#13;
                                   efforts will lead to nothing in the long-run.&#13;
&#13;
                                                I strongly support the population project.&#13;

&#13;
                                                I think there will be further comment on that last&#13;

&#13;
                                                We have a number of issues here before us, Mr.&#13;

                             be eliminated and be reduced.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The export tax on coffee can be criticized in the&#13;
&#13;
                             sense that it may reduce&#13;

                                       MR. DEVAUX:     It makes coffee less competitive.     On&#13;
&#13;
                             the other hand, it is the only way to tax a large sector of&#13;
&#13;
                             the economy.     In fact, there is an income tax which is&#13;
&#13;
                             perceived at the time the product leaves the country. And,&#13;
&#13;
                             therefore, it is very embarrassing to eliminate a tax which&#13;
&#13;
                             is, after all, the normal contribution of a sector. There are&#13;
&#13;
                             other ways to make it more competitive.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Concerning the private sector, the credit recognizes&#13;
                             that improving the private sector is very important, but that&#13;
&#13;
                             is certainly not the only thing. We are trying to establish&#13;
&#13;
                             the proper framework for private sector development.&#13;

&#13;
                             are trying to do their best to increase that capacity.      In&#13;

                             low in the past few years. We are very conscious of that and&#13;
&#13;
                             we have undertaken last summer steps to improve the rate of&#13;

&#13;
                                        Number one, we had a seminar on disbursement&#13;
&#13;
                             procedures for Bank credit. The administrative procedures as&#13;
&#13;
                             to weakness of institutions in Rwanda are sometimes cumbersome&#13;
&#13;
                             and we had to remind them how they should ask for requests of&#13;

                             disbursements of Bank loans.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Secondly, the procurement procedures in Rwanda are&#13;
&#13;
                             extremely delicate and cumbersome, and we also during the&#13;
&#13;
                             same seminar had a special session on procurement procedures&#13;

                                        Normally, we should have seen some impact of those&#13;

                             seminars if the war had not prevented the implementation of a&#13;

                             percent minimum tariff on all imports as an obstacle to&#13;

&#13;
                             to exempt capital goods from any import tax. The 10 percent&#13;
&#13;
                             across the board tariff is essential to manage to reduce the&#13;

&#13;
                               you that the terms of trade have been seriously deteriorated&#13;
&#13;
                               over the last five years on account basically of the decline&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                            In fact, the sarne speaker was indicating that he&#13;
&#13;
                               was concerned with the decline of exports in value, and the&#13;
&#13;
                               export was increasing in volume, in fact just reflecting the&#13;
&#13;
                               sad situation of coffee prices which have been declining over&#13;
&#13;
                               the last few years.&#13;
&#13;
                                            We obviously are concerned about the program of&#13;
&#13;
                               diversification and these actually create the environment for&#13;
&#13;
                               this diversification. What we see in a country like Rwanda is&#13;
&#13;
                               an industrialization towards exports, an export-led growth.&#13;
&#13;
                               That is what we are looking at.&#13;
&#13;
                                            We would like to take advantage of the differential&#13;

                                important and, more important, the marketing system. Without&#13;
&#13;
                                the proper marketing system, there is no way you can export.&#13;
&#13;
                                          So, what we have been doing is to establish the&#13;
&#13;
                                proper framework for Rwanda, to get a lower exchange rate,&#13;
&#13;
                                liberalize the economy, open up the borders, try to establish&#13;
&#13;
                                the right kind of tariffs which are the preconditions for any&#13;
&#13;
                                kind of development.&#13;
&#13;
                                          NOw, we know that it will take time for the&#13;
&#13;
                                industrial development to take place.   In the short-term we&#13;
&#13;
                                are working on improving coffee production, in improving tea&#13;
&#13;
                                production, in trying to diversify agriculture, and that is&#13;
&#13;
                                one of the objectives of the reform program on coffee that we&#13;
&#13;
                                have in this program, but also of the operations of agricul-&#13;

                                          You mentioned the problem of the health sector. We&#13;
&#13;
                                are very concerned about the health sector and in the social&#13;
&#13;
                                safety net.   One of the key things we took care of was to&#13;

                                  will remain at least the same as the existing one.&#13;
&#13;
                                            On top of that, we made a special provision to make&#13;
&#13;
                                  sure that the resource allocation for the purchase of&#13;
&#13;
                                  medicine will be considerably increased.&#13;
&#13;
                                            On energy, we are obviously trying to help the&#13;
&#13;
                                  government to develop the gas methane project. We have a&#13;
&#13;
                                  sector energy project in our lending program, and this 'is&#13;
&#13;
                                  going to be dealt with in that context.&#13;
&#13;
                                            The tariff increase in electricity is not at all&#13;
&#13;
                                  incompatible with the effort to diversify and to industria-&#13;
&#13;
                                  lize. The problem is that we cannot afford to have the&#13;
&#13;
                                  electricity company to lose money. At this juncture, a large&#13;
&#13;
                                  share of the electricity use in Rwanda is imported from&#13;
&#13;
                                  neighboring countries, and is sold at a price which is below&#13;
&#13;
                                  the price of companies. We have to put back a reasonable&#13;
&#13;
                                  company on a financial situation which is appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
                                            Concerning the risk, we raised the question of the&#13;
&#13;
                                  risk not because we have a doubt that the government will&#13;
&#13;
                                  implement the program; otherwise, we will not have presented&#13;
&#13;
                                  it to the Board. But there were a number of important&#13;
&#13;
                                  considerations in the case of Rwanda.&#13;
&#13;
                                            First of all, Rwanda has been extremely reluctant&#13;
&#13;
                                  for a number of reasons for a number of years to embark on an&#13;

                                adjustment program. So, given those hesitations which took&#13;
&#13;
                                four to five years, we felt it was important to reassure the&#13;
&#13;
                                Board that this period of hesitation was actually the reason&#13;
&#13;
                                why we believe the government is committed to the program.&#13;
&#13;
                                           On top of that, the government demonstrated its&#13;
&#13;
                                commitment by taking some very, very politically sensitive&#13;
&#13;
                                measures in the midst of the difficult political situation.&#13;
&#13;
                                We have absolutely no doubt this program will be implemented.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Interest rates:   Yes, of course, we are looking for&#13;
&#13;
                                positive interest rates. At this juncture, interest rates are&#13;
&#13;
                                positive in Rwanda. The inflation, the latest figures of&#13;
&#13;
                                inflation shows us an inflation rate on an annual basis of 15&#13;
&#13;
                                percent.   The interest rates are 19 percent. They are&#13;
&#13;
                                positive for the first time.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Now, obviously, we will have to review it and the&#13;
&#13;
                                financial sector adjustment credit will obviously take care&#13;
&#13;
                                of that.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Exoneration of tax on public enterprises:   We don't&#13;
&#13;
                                see any reasons why public enterprises should be exonerated.&#13;
&#13;
                                They are enterprises like any enterprise. There is a need in.&#13;
&#13;
                                Rwanda to improve the fiscal situation. All enterprises have&#13;
&#13;
                                to be taxed, either if they are private or public.     There is&#13;
&#13;
                                no discrimination.   If they have not been taxed in the past,&#13;

&#13;
                                  heard incorrectly the staff explanation on the coffee export&#13;
&#13;
                                  tax.   I believe I have heard that the export tax was accep-&#13;

                                  coffee sector. Can you please clarify this subject, because&#13;
&#13;
                                  if this is the case, we are very much distorting some of our&#13;

                                  basic principles?&#13;
&#13;
                                            MR. CONABLE:     What about real estate taxes?&#13;
&#13;
                                            MR. JAYCOX;     This country doesn't have real estate&#13;
&#13;
                                  taxes except in the Cities. This country doesn't have income&#13;
&#13;
                                  taxes on small peasants.&#13;
&#13;
                                            The only way that this sector can be taxed is&#13;
&#13;
                                  through an export tax on the product. It is easy administra-&#13;
&#13;
                                  tively and it is the only sector in this country.     It also&#13;
&#13;
                                  is, as a result of devaluation, very profitable, even at the&#13;
                                  low prices.&#13;
&#13;
                                            In fact, we don't want to not tax this product&#13;
&#13;
                                  because we want to diversify. We certainly don't want to have&#13;

                                to diversify, not to privilege this sector so much.&#13;

&#13;
                                diversifying your revenue sources?&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. JAYCOX:    Sure.&#13;

&#13;
                                          MR. JAYCOX:    But you can do that only if your&#13;
&#13;
                                revenue take is larger than the administrative costs of&#13;
&#13;
                                getting the take. And these things are under very careful&#13;
&#13;
                                review with the IMF and the World Bank staff, looking at&#13;
&#13;
                                these issues of how to raise revenues in a country like&#13;
&#13;
                                Rwanda without dampening economic activity.&#13;
&#13;
                                          There is nothing very secret about it. After the&#13;
&#13;
                                devaluation, I think we should look at what percentage of the&#13;
&#13;
                                world market price is actually going to end up in the hands&#13;
&#13;
                                of the peasants. That is the bottom line because if it isn't&#13;
&#13;
                                adequate, they will not produce coffee.&#13;

                                       I thank Mr. Devaux for the response on the energy.&#13;
&#13;
                             Actually, the electricity rates are important as far as the&#13;
&#13;
                             competitiveness is concerned, but also the other side, the&#13;
&#13;
                             petroleum which, as the document indicates, is substantially&#13;
&#13;
                             higher than national prices, and the rates are already&#13;
&#13;
                             increased by, I think, 67 percent and now the tariff.&#13;
&#13;
                                       The question is obviously there is a budgetary&#13;

                             impact    I see Mr. Abu-zobaa there from the Fund -- this is&#13;

                             a very important element. But at the same time, how is this&#13;
&#13;
                             reconciled with the attempts to promote exports?   When you&#13;
&#13;
                             increase the inputs, obviously it affects the competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                             And how would this increase affect the promotion of exports&#13;
&#13;
                             and the diversification of such exports?&#13;
&#13;
                                       So, there are two sides to that issue:   one, the&#13;
&#13;
                             budgetary, which is important; the other is the structural&#13;
&#13;
                             element and especially as far as exports are concerned.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Thank you.&#13;

                                       Before we answer that question, we have a follow-up&#13;
&#13;
                             from Monsieur de Fontaine Vive.&#13;

&#13;
                                taxation on public enterprises, I never advocated for any&#13;
&#13;
                                exemption.     I think my question was misunderstood.&#13;
&#13;
                                             My question was I read in the last sentence in&#13;
&#13;
                                paragraph 54 that all PEs are exempt from income taxes.       So,&#13;
&#13;
                                that is your statement about the present situation, and that&#13;
&#13;
                                is what I am challenging. And then when we are turning to the&#13;
&#13;
                                action plan, which is supposed to be described on the&#13;
&#13;
                                following paragraph, which is 55, I don't find anything about&#13;
&#13;
                                that.&#13;
&#13;
                                             That was my question. Why don't we have something&#13;
&#13;
                                about that?     Is it an implicit part of the action?   That was&#13;
&#13;
                                my question.&#13;
&#13;
                                             My second follow-up is about the risk, the so-&#13;
&#13;
                                called risk about the commitment of the government. The&#13;
&#13;
                                explanation about the slow and the long discussion between&#13;
&#13;
                                the government and the World Bank, among some other donors,&#13;
&#13;
                                is given in paragraph 72 as the third risk. So, I don't see&#13;
&#13;
                                any reason to have this risk about the commitment of the&#13;
&#13;
                                government. As a matter of fact, I was wondering generally if&#13;
&#13;
                                we could avoid such a paragraph in any loans because, as you&#13;
&#13;
                                said, when you are presenting such a loan to the Board, we&#13;
&#13;
                                think you have solved the problem.&#13;
&#13;
                                             MR. CONABLE:   Mr. Jaycox, do you want to respond?&#13;

&#13;
                                         MR. JAYCOX:     I will just speak to this last point.&#13;
&#13;
                               What was meant to be said on risk was the internalization&#13;
&#13;
                               process, not the will of government, but the fact that the&#13;
&#13;
                               population has been fully brought onboard with respect both&#13;
&#13;
                               to the aims and the trials and tribulations that the popula-&#13;
&#13;
                               tion is going to have to go through.&#13;
&#13;
                                         We do not feel that this is done very well in most&#13;
&#13;
                               of Africa. We raised the issue that if the population is not&#13;
&#13;
                               brought onboard in these projects, in these programs, they&#13;
&#13;
                               are not explained to them properly, that, in fact, there will&#13;
&#13;
                               be hitches in the implementation.     And this is raised not as&#13;
&#13;
                               a question of political will but a question of internaliza-&#13;
&#13;
                               tion.&#13;
&#13;
                                         I think the paragraph has been misinterpreted. This&#13;
&#13;
                               is the paragraph that we were both referring to earlier, I&#13;
&#13;
                               believe. Is it not?     Have I responded to the question?&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. DE FONTAINE VlVE:     As usual, we fully agree&#13;
&#13;
                               with Mr. Jaycox about Africa. So, I have no problem, but what&#13;
&#13;
                               he is explaining about internalization, which is quite right,&#13;
&#13;
                               is what you call the third risk on paragraph 72.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. JAYCOX:     Yes. That is what I thought.&#13;
&#13;
                                         MR. DE FONTAINE VIVE:     And I am not changing all&#13;

&#13;
                                       What I was challenging is the previous one, which&#13;
&#13;
                             is the 71 and which is only about government's willingness.&#13;
&#13;
                             And this one I think could be avoided.&#13;
&#13;
                                       MR. CONABLE:   Mr. Aguirre-Sacasa wants to respond&#13;
&#13;
                             also.&#13;
&#13;
                                       MR. AGUIRRE-SACASA:   Let me just say two or three&#13;
&#13;
                             things.   Number one, the government demonstrated at a very&#13;
&#13;
                             delicate moment, in fact during the moment of greatest&#13;
&#13;
                             fighting back in October, that it was committed to the&#13;
&#13;
                             adjustment program by taking many of the actions that Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Devaux referred to.&#13;
&#13;
                                        But there are vested interests in Rwanda, as there&#13;
&#13;
                             are in many countries, that stand to lose from the adjustment&#13;
&#13;
                             process. And some of these groups will clearly continue to&#13;
&#13;
                             put pressure on the government to roll back under the&#13;
&#13;
                             reforms. This happens in every country. And we have seen many&#13;
&#13;
                             examples around the world of countries that.embark on an&#13;
&#13;
                             adjustment program and then for diverse reasons, many of them&#13;
&#13;
                             political, falloff of the adjustment track.&#13;

                             there. But there is always a risk -- and that is what we were&#13;
&#13;
                             trying to indicate here -- that at some point a constellation&#13;

&#13;
                             interests in the country could cause the government to pause&#13;
&#13;
                             and perhaps even roll back the reform.&#13;
&#13;
                                       It is very difficult to predict what is going to&#13;
&#13;
                             happen here. We feel comfortable that the Rwandese Government&#13;
&#13;
                             is going to adhere to the reform process, but there is always&#13;
&#13;
                             a small risk, Mr. de Fontaine Vive -- and that is what we are&#13;
&#13;
                             trying to say here -- that government commitment at some&#13;

                             risk. And, in fact, I think it was put there to show that we&#13;

&#13;
                                 what they were doing is anticipating their skepticism when&#13;

&#13;
                                           However, I agree with Mr. de Fontaine Vive, we&#13;

                                 should not raise issues if they are not really big issues.&#13;

&#13;
                                 remote.   I think this particular section of the reports are&#13;
&#13;
                                 appropriate there.&#13;
&#13;
                                            I found as a lender for many years that risks&#13;

                                 rarely disappear by simply closing your eyes to them. At&#13;

                                 that we address them appropriately as opposed to pretending&#13;

&#13;
                                       So, I take into consideration clearly what my&#13;
&#13;
                             colleague has said about why raise straw issues, issues that&#13;
&#13;
                             don't exist.   And I think that is an appropriate conunent.        If&#13;
&#13;
                             it is a risk, bring it up; if it isn't a risk, don't put it&#13;
&#13;
                             in, don't raise it as a strawman. But for goodness sakes, I&#13;
&#13;
                             would hate for staff to take that to be that we only want&#13;
&#13;
                             selectively to raise risk issues at the Board.&#13;
&#13;
                                       I think the risk issues, as staff perceives them,&#13;
&#13;
                             should be fully put into the reports.&#13;
&#13;
                                       MR. CONABLE:    I think it is a reflection of more&#13;
&#13;
                             generalized experience than it is necessarily a prediction of&#13;
&#13;
                             what is likely to happen in Rwanda.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Yes, Mr. Jaycox.&#13;
&#13;
                                       MR. JAYCOX:    If I may, I would like to answer Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                             Rehm's question, or the implied question about where we&#13;
&#13;
                             stand, where we are going with respect to regional cooperation&#13;
&#13;
                             and economic integration for these landlocked countries, not&#13;
&#13;
                             only the landlocked countries but all the small economies of&#13;
&#13;
                             Africa.&#13;
&#13;
                                       In our Long-Term Perspective Study, we set out a&#13;
&#13;
                             perspective, if you will, of an increasing cooperation&#13;
&#13;
                             amongst African states on the economic front. Clearly, they&#13;
&#13;
                             are not highly complementary economies to begin with, in many&#13;

                             set up on too small a scale in the past and which would&#13;

                             benefit from a wider market integration financially and in&#13;

                             specialization, all the things that lead to efficiencies in&#13;

&#13;
                                        There does exist now in this part of Africa the&#13;
&#13;
                             preferential trade area, the PTA of Eastern and Southern&#13;
&#13;
                             Africa.    Rwanda is a member, and all of its neighbors are&#13;
&#13;
                             members.   They are in many ways finding their way at the&#13;
&#13;
                             moment.&#13;
&#13;
                                        We are trying to assist them with basically good&#13;
&#13;
                             ideas which can be the basis for international negotiation of&#13;
&#13;
                             certain new arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
                                         It is not easy to start, as I say, with competitive&#13;
&#13;
                             economies and aim toward complementary ones, where indeed the&#13;

                               off to a start which we can support, and hopefully we are&#13;

&#13;
                               till now technically.&#13;
&#13;
                                           You mentioned Pays des Grands Lac in Central&#13;
&#13;
                               Africa. This is also an entity.     There are lot of these&#13;
&#13;
                               ~ntities.    In fact, there are over 100 cooperative, interna-&#13;
&#13;
                               tional cooperative entities now in Africa.     Most of them are&#13;
&#13;
                               dead letters.    Many of them really have no support from their&#13;
&#13;
                               membership. At least they don't pay their dues, and, as a&#13;
&#13;
                               result, they can't pay their staffs. So, they cannot function.&#13;
&#13;
                                           I think sorting out has to be done as to which one&#13;
&#13;
                               of these is worthy of development.     I am not sure that&#13;
&#13;
                               outsiders can make those choices, but it is very important&#13;
&#13;
                               that we start a process whereby some kind of selectivity is&#13;
&#13;
                               fostered and indeed Africa puts forward a fewer number with&#13;

                               greater possibilities for economic cooperation.&#13;

                               quality rather than expansion of acreage.&#13;

                               was buried somewhere.     It wasn't answered about the recon-&#13;

&#13;
                              that of the cost structure of industry, energy costs tended&#13;
&#13;
                              to be very low, as low as 10 percent, and even lower in some&#13;

                              cases.&#13;

                                                MR. AL-ASSAF:          Mr. Chairman,   I   think it was last&#13;
&#13;
                                  week when we discussed the Senegal transportation sector, and&#13;
&#13;
                                  it was clear at that time that the impact of the high cost of&#13;
&#13;
                                  energy -- and also that was the case in other countries --&#13;
&#13;
                                  and   I   think, despite the small size of the industrial sector&#13;
&#13;
                                  in Rwanda,     I    am sure it has an impact, whether it is in the&#13;
&#13;
                                  industrial sector or agriculture, other products, not&#13;
&#13;
                                  necessarily coffee.&#13;
&#13;
                                                So,    I   believe it has an impact, like other countries       r&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  in Africa, and we should have a closer look at it, especially&#13;
&#13;
                                  that these prices are, as I mentioned, substantially higher&#13;
&#13;
                                  than international levels and neighboring countries, regional&#13;
&#13;
                                  competitiveness,          I   think, is important here.&#13;

                                           MR. JAYCOX:     Perhaps we should go back just a&#13;
&#13;
                                 little bit over the Senegal issue.      In Senegal, we have an&#13;
&#13;
                                 absolute crisis in competitiveness. The country cannot change&#13;
&#13;
                                 its exchange rate.   It has to. reduce the civil service&#13;
&#13;
                                 dramatically and the nominal wages eventually of all the&#13;
&#13;
                                 formal sector.    It has to also reduce the prices of every&#13;
&#13;
                                 kind of input to industrial activity in order to become&#13;
&#13;
                                 competitive if it cannot change its exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
                                           And in so doing, it is going to forego some of the&#13;
&#13;
                                 major receipts.   Now, we do not advocate this point of view&#13;
&#13;
                                 for a country that does have the flexibility. We find that&#13;
&#13;
                                 what I am talking about has a highly deflationary effect on&#13;
&#13;
                                 the economy in many cases, and it is a very, very difficult,&#13;
&#13;
                                 most difficult course of structural adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
                                           In Rwanda we don't have this problem, but we need&#13;
&#13;
                                 the revenues. This economy will not be able to be stabilized&#13;
&#13;
                                 without these revenues.&#13;
&#13;
                                           There aren't any other sources of revenues. This is&#13;
&#13;
                                 a very small economy.     Its coffee and imports have to pay for&#13;
&#13;
                                 everything -- schools, clinics, everything. And if they are&#13;
&#13;
                                 not available, then they run deficits. And if they run&#13;
&#13;
                                 deficits, then they have to continuously devalue their&#13;

                                              So, we don't have all these options.   I think the&#13;
&#13;
                                  balances that have been taken in the case       I mean, obviously&#13;
&#13;
                                  we are not going to so tax petroleum that we put productive&#13;
&#13;
                                  enterprises out of business; obviously not.&#13;
&#13;
                                              We are not going to tax exports of anything to the&#13;
&#13;
                                  extent that we somehow can inhibit one bag of exportable&#13;
&#13;
                                  coffee to leave the country. That is not the objective. The&#13;
&#13;
                                  objective is to balance these things, get the revenues and&#13;
&#13;
                                  get the productive activity.&#13;
&#13;
                                              I don't know if we need input from the IMF, but I&#13;
&#13;
                                  mean these are the kind of considerations that go into these&#13;
&#13;
                                  recommendations. We don't just go after revenue in a blind&#13;
&#13;
                                  feeding frenzy.    Obviously, where we go for it depends on&#13;
&#13;
                                  what kind of economic impact it has.&#13;

                                          On the amount of remuneration in effect paid to the&#13;
&#13;
                                Rwandan small coffee producer, we estimate that it is about&#13;
&#13;
                                75 percent of the world market price even after the taxes&#13;
&#13;
                                that are paid. So, this is one of the highest retention&#13;
&#13;
                                rates, if you will, of any country.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:   In Africa.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. AGUIRRE-SACASA:     In fact, one of the big&#13;
&#13;
                                problems that we have had in Rwanda all along is that the&#13;
&#13;
                                producer price for coffee in Rwanda has been very high, and&#13;
&#13;
                                there has actually been a subsidy from the government to the&#13;
&#13;
                                coffee producer.&#13;
&#13;
                                          On the gasoline or petroleum derivative prices, at&#13;
&#13;
                                today's exchange rate a gallon of high test gasoline in&#13;
&#13;
                                Kigali retails for about $3.80.     It is lower than in many&#13;
&#13;
                                European countries, and when you consider the distance from&#13;
&#13;
                                Mombasa and from Dar es Salaam, the ports from which this&#13;
&#13;
                                gasoline is brought, it is not, in our view, excessively high.&#13;
&#13;
                                          MR. CONABLE:   All right.    I don't think Mr. Al-&#13;
&#13;
                                Assaf is going to agree with you easily on this.&#13;
