&#13;
                          April 12, 1993 
&#13;
Q:   I'm william Becker with George Washington university and&#13;
the Business History Group.     I'll be conducting this&#13;
interview.&#13;
A:   And I am William Diamond, a former staff member of The&#13;
World Bank, retired now, but still reasonably active.&#13;
Q:   To begin with would you review briefly your career with&#13;
the Bank?&#13;
A:   Ves, I will.     I joined the Bank on August 11, 1946.     I&#13;
had been working in Europe with UNRRA, the united Nations&#13;
Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.     I had an offer&#13;
from the then Director of the Operations Department -- or&#13;
Loan Department.     I'm not sure. what the title was at that&#13;
particular moment.     I returned to Washington and made the&#13;
decision, in the light of other alternatives, to start here.&#13;
However, I remained only one month and then went off, at the&#13;
request of the u.s. government, to be a member of the staff&#13;
of the Foreign Trade Administration of Greece.     I returned&#13;
after a year and started again at the Bank as a Junior Loan&#13;
Officer working on Turkey.     I remained, a Loan Officer but at&#13;
rising levels of seniority, until the latter part of 1955.&#13;
In that period I dealt with various countries in the Middle&#13;
East, southern Europe,&#13;
&amp;#12;                               - 2 -
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Afrioa, Asia; I was Junior Loan officer, senior Loan Officer,&#13;
ultimately Division Chief.&#13;
     In 1955 I left the normal staff of the bank to join Dr.&#13;
Alec (now Sir Alec) Cairncross (he had held Adam Smith's&#13;
chair at the University of Glasgow) to help him set up the&#13;
Economic Development Institute, a staff college which the&#13;
World Bank established to help raise the level of economic&#13;
management among the senior officials, of the developing&#13;
oountries.&#13;
     I remained with EDl for three years and then returned to&#13;
the Bank, first as a Division Chief and, in due course, as&#13;
Assistant Director of the Western Hemisphere Department of&#13;
the World Bank.    After two years there, Martin Rosen, the&#13;
Executive Vice President of IFC, asked me to head up the new&#13;
Development Bank services Department in the International&#13;
Finance corporation.    There I remained until President&#13;
McNamara came, in 1968.     About six months after his arrival,&#13;
he moved the entire Development Bank services Department from&#13;
the IFC to the World Bank.     I remained as head of that&#13;
Department so long as it existed.&#13;
     On Ootober 1, 1972, the MoNamara reorganization of The&#13;
World Bank took place and that Department was broken up and&#13;
regionalized.     I became head of the South Asia Department for&#13;
three years.    I then decided the time had come to go to a&#13;
&amp;#12;                              -   3 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
different kind of post , a non-managerial one: and I was&#13;
invited by Peter Cargill, who had been Vice President for&#13;
South Asia and was then the Senior Vice President for&#13;
Finance, to join him as an advisor on the mobilization of&#13;
resources for IDA.&#13;
     That's where I was when I had my big heart problem which&#13;
knocked me out for almost a year and which was responsible&#13;
for my long residence at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.     When I&#13;
returned to work, I decided I had had enough of being a boss&#13;
and bossing other people and I decided to take early&#13;
retirement.    That I did at the end of March 1978.&#13;
Q:   In this long career, what would you see as your most&#13;
important contributions?&#13;
A:   Well, it may be hard to distinguish between the most&#13;
important contributions and the things that I most enjoyed&#13;
doing.   But I think I can identify some of those.    One was&#13;
participating in the creation of the Economic Development&#13;
Institute.    There wasn't anything quite like it in the World&#13;
at that time, although when the Institute was set up under&#13;
Alec Cairncross's direction, there were two models in his&#13;
mind and in the mind of The World Bank.    One was the Merrill&#13;
Center on Long Island, to which senior people from foreign&#13;
countries as well as senior executives and government&#13;
officials from the U.S. were invited for several months at a&#13;
&amp;#12;                               - 4 Â­&#13;
&#13;
time to exchange views with each other.     The other principal&#13;
model was the British Administrative Staff College at Henley&#13;
outside of London.&#13;
     The EDl was completely new, however, and we had no&#13;
guidelines except what we thought was right.     No rules or&#13;
precedents to follow.     Everything was brand new.   It was a&#13;
great experience to participate in its creation.      I believe&#13;
that the Economic Development Institute, although it has had&#13;
its ups and downs, has, in fact, paid its way and enjoyed a&#13;
pretty good reputation wherever it is known and wherever its&#13;
graduates, or Fellows, are working.     I'm very proud of my&#13;
involvement with the Institute.&#13;
     lim also proud of my contributions in the area of&#13;
development banks.   That subject was immensely popular in the&#13;
World Bank and in much of the donors' world outside of&#13;
Washington for a while.    Then it came on poor times.    But the&#13;
fact is that for a While, beginning in the early 50s the Bank&#13;
(alone and sometimes together with the International Finance&#13;
corporation) promoted the establishment of several dozen&#13;
financial institutions in the developing world of a kind&#13;
which the developing world didn't know, hadn't had before.&#13;
They were institutions to provide long-term capital both in&#13;
loan and equity form and to provide certain other kinds of&#13;
services.   The bilateral aid institutions and other&#13;
&amp;#12;                             -   5 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
international organizations, began to pursue the same course.&#13;
     There was a moment in the 50s and 60s when it was said&#13;
that when a nation achieved statehood, it wanted first of all&#13;
to become a member of the United Nations and, secondly, to&#13;
become a member of the World Bank and thirdly, to receive&#13;
assistance in the establishment of a steel mill and a&#13;
development bank.   sometimes an airline was added to this,&#13;
where airlines didn't exist already.    Development banks were&#13;
immensely popular, and despite the fact that many of them had&#13;
troubles, others have had a permanent impact on economic&#13;
development in their countries, on the behavior of&#13;
entrepreneurs, and on the activities of other financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
Q:   You talk about troubles.    What kind of troubles had the&#13;
development banks gotten into?&#13;
A:   Well, first of all, the managements of many development&#13;
banks discovered that they had a pretty cozy job after a few&#13;
years.   They could get capital almost any time that they&#13;
wanted it from the World Bank and from their own governments.&#13;
Many of them forgot that the object was to reduce their&#13;
reliance on international organizations, bilateral resources&#13;
and from resources provided by their own governments on&#13;
subsidized terms.   Capital was always easy to get.   It became&#13;
increasingly so from the World Bank, especially once McNamara&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 6 Â­&#13;
&#13;
became President because of his great stress on the transfer&#13;
of resources.   It was relatively easy for us to make loans to&#13;
development finance institutions in which we were already&#13;
involved, compared to making loans for new types of projects&#13;
that required study and evaluation    ~   DQYQ.&#13;
     Secondly, as many development bank officials were&#13;
becoming lazy and taking the easy way, the priorities of&#13;
their governments and of the World Bank began to change.        The&#13;
World Bank became increasingly interested in non-directly&#13;
productive projects (without neglect of the others.)&#13;
Priorities focused on health, education, the environment and&#13;
other such areas, thus reducing the priority given to&#13;
development banks.&#13;
     Then the managements, and this is perhaps one factor&#13;
that can be attributed to the easy life that they discovered&#13;
they led, the managements of development banks didn't pay&#13;
enough attention to environmental factors.        And here I am not&#13;
talking about the natural environment that is a principal&#13;
subject of concern these days, but the fact that the world&#13;
had changed, including the economic and financial sectors in&#13;
which they lived.    When they first came into existence they&#13;
had no competitors; but by the 70s and certainly in the 80s&#13;
there was important competition in the activities in which&#13;
they engaged.   Important competition, not only from other&#13;
&amp;#12;                               - 7 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
kinds of financial institutions in the countries in which&#13;
they were operating but also from financial institutions&#13;
abroad which began to lend and to invest more in the&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
        still another factor was the worsening economic&#13;
situation of the world which made it difficult for many of&#13;
their clients to service loans.        If a client had difficulty&#13;
surviving, it was inevitable that the development bank which&#13;
financed it would run into financial trouble.        There was&#13;
another factor.     It is likely that the Bank itself, when we&#13;
first started to promote and to deal with such institutions,&#13;
took too narrow a view of them.        We insulated them from the&#13;
rest of the financial sector.     We sort of made an elite of&#13;
them.     We didn't recognize the potential importance, even in&#13;
providing long-term finance, of other types of financial&#13;
institutions including commercial banks.        In the Bank's&#13;
concern for development banks, it lost sight of the financial&#13;
sector as a whole.&#13;
        If you read my 1957 book on development banks and the&#13;
speeches and papers of high-ranking Bank officials in the 10&#13;
or 15 years after that, you will discover that we always&#13;
talked and wrote about the potential role of the development&#13;
banks in capital markets and about the need to adjust their&#13;
operations--to change their mix of products--as the market&#13;
&amp;#12;                                 -    8 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
changed.     But we did very little to enforce that.&#13;
Q:     When you say "we," you mean the Bank?&#13;
A:     I mean the World Bank.        Now there were some development&#13;
bank managers who knew what it meant to scan the environment&#13;
and to adjust to changing circumstances.           You will find that&#13;
these changed and in 10 or 15 years became institutions in a&#13;
sense quite different from the ones that we and the original&#13;
promoters had in mind.     But most of them, as I said, led a&#13;
rather cozy kind of life.       capital was easy to come by, until&#13;
now.&#13;
       I guess this sums up what went wrong.         That is not&#13;
really the right phrase.     I shouldn't have used that phrase,&#13;
"what went wrong. n    The environment changed.        These&#13;
institutions remained stuck in a rut, stuck in what became a&#13;
rut.    They were created for a certain kind of environment;&#13;
and we helped dig a rut for them by providing funds&#13;
relatively easily, and, they didn't accommodate themselves to&#13;
the new situation in Which they had to operate.&#13;
       Let me add something to this.         It was not only the&#13;
development banks and their managements that were enjoying a&#13;
cozy life.    Bank staff also were.         They weren't keeping up&#13;
with their reading on what was happening.           ! might add that I&#13;
&#13;
was by this time no longer in development bank business, but&#13;
even before I left, I was writing and giving talks on the&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 9 Â­&#13;
&#13;
need to change in response to environmental change.       But for&#13;
most of the Bank staff involved in development banks, they&#13;
didn't keep up-to-date.&#13;
     Maybe I should add another point.    with the&#13;
reorganization of 1972, the development bank staff like that&#13;
of other technical departments, were regionalized.       They were&#13;
divided up, spread around to various parts of the Bank.       They&#13;
often came under people who didn't know much about the&#13;
subject and were not always interested in the subject.       And&#13;
it became increasingly difficult, with the regionalization,&#13;
to assure coordination, common policies and effective quality&#13;
control among technical staff (all of them, not just&#13;
development banks staff) in various parts of the world.       Does&#13;
that answer your question?&#13;
Q:   I think it does, yes.    I'd like to turn back to EDI,&#13;
which along with the development banks you saw as part of&#13;
your major contributions.    I wondered if you've been&#13;
following the developments in EDI since you retired?&#13;
A:   Since my retirement, very little.&#13;
Q:   Very little?&#13;
A:   Very little.   For a while, I followed developments more&#13;
closely than I do now because, not surprisingly, I'm among&#13;
the passe, so far as EOl is concerned.    For one thing I&#13;
remain associated with the original model of development&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 10 Â­&#13;
&#13;
banks which have become out of date.     Even though I left the&#13;
model behind a long time ago!     Also, because it becomes too&#13;
difficult, as an outsider, to follow everything that is going&#13;
on.&#13;
Q:     Well, generally rather than specifically then, do you&#13;
think that EDI, which, has gone through a series of changes,&#13;
has lived to the promise that you originally thought that it&#13;
had?&#13;
A:     Well, I have mixed feelings about that.   The original&#13;
thought was to establish a staff college for senior&#13;
officials.     These were supposed to be really big shots who&#13;
would come and spend six months in Washington.     There was an&#13;
error in our thinking here.     No really senior official in a&#13;
government can leave for six months and have his job when he&#13;
goes back.     Nevertheless, some people did come in the first&#13;
two or three years who were pretty senior and who rose to the&#13;
top ministerial or sub-ministerial level on their return,&#13;
                                                          L&#13;
persons like Song In song of Korea, and sunthorn HongladArom&#13;
of Thailand.&#13;
       It was in about the fifth, sixth, seventh year after the&#13;
creation of the institution that its orientation changed.&#13;
Already the six-month period had been reduced to three months&#13;
per course.     But what began to press on people's minds was&#13;
that the Bank's principal repute was in the area of&#13;
&amp;#12;                              -   11 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
individual projects:   project selection, project appraisal,&#13;
project supervision.   There grew, increasingly, a feeling&#13;
among senior Bank staff and among EDl staff that the EDl&#13;
courses should be more oriented towards dealing with the&#13;
project cycle.   In one sector after another, that became the&#13;
subject of the EDl courses.       Industrial projects course,&#13;
agricultural projects course, power projects course, and&#13;
ultimately, education and health and so forth.       That&#13;
remained, by and large, the principal orientation of EDl for&#13;
about 20 years, until the early part of the BOs.       I find it a&#13;
pity, not that there were courses devoted to project&#13;
evaluation, but that there was a diminution of interest in&#13;
general economic management for people in finance ministries,&#13;
planning agencies and other development management agencies.&#13;
Q:   Why was that?&#13;
A:   Well, I know why there was a new emphasis on projects.&#13;
This was what the Bank most, and with some justice, prided&#13;
itself on.   What I can't tell you is why at this time they&#13;
cut back on the policy orientation.&#13;
     There was another thing that troubled me.       You may&#13;
recall, from having read my bio data, that I went back to EDl&#13;
for my last six months in the World Bank, as a so-called&#13;
Senior Fellow with freedom to do anything I wanted.         During&#13;
that time, I looked at what was happening in development bank&#13;
&amp;#12;                            - 12 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
training, but I did other things as well.   I discovered that,&#13;
some years before, a decision had been taken to focus&#13;
increasingly on training, not here in Washington, but&#13;
training in the countries themselves.   I thought that&#13;
decision was a right one.   There was a serious limitation on&#13;
the amount of influence you could have and on the number of&#13;
people that you could reach by bringing them here to&#13;
Washington.   Besides, coming to Washington always provided a&#13;
temptation, not for serious work, 'but for tourism.    And the&#13;
decision was therefore taken to look for training&#13;
institutions in other countries to take on, together with&#13;
EDI, the job of training local people at home.   But very&#13;
little had been done about it.   (Shortly after I retired from&#13;
the Bank, I wrote a paper called "Training Starts at Home",&#13;
which has been reprinted about a dozen times.)   One of my&#13;
strong recommendations, when I became Senior Fellow in the&#13;
development bank field, was to abandon all development bank&#13;
training in washington with one exception, which was followed&#13;
for three years.   By this time, this was the latter part of&#13;
the 70s -- 1977, 1918 -- you could get as good a training in&#13;
project appraisal in many universities and other institutions&#13;
around the world as you could get from World Bank staff.&#13;
Besides which, there was the question of how many you could&#13;
reach if you bring 20 people into a course, once or even&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;                                              - 13 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                twice a year.     The individual courses were abandoned about&#13;
                that time.&#13;
                     The one exception I proposed was that I felt that there&#13;
                ought to be a course from time to time, say once a year -- it&#13;
                was actually given three times, once in French, twice in&#13;
                English -- for chief executives only.        It would be a one-week&#13;
                tour d'horizon, of principal issues with which CEOs of&#13;
                development banks have to deal.        That continued for three&#13;
                years.   Then that, too, was abandoned and all that remained&#13;
                of development bank training was a course called Training the&#13;
                Trainers.    This was for people who would be involved in&#13;
                passing on whatever experience we had as well as their own&#13;
                experience to others who would be the nucleus of EDI staffs&#13;
                in the Bank's member countries.&#13;
                     In 1982 there was something of a revolution in EDI.          It&#13;
                involved personalities and was very messy.&#13;
                                                 One of the results was that&#13;
                             Clausen, commissioned a task force under the&#13;
Q[2      6 .&#13;
f;:2::; '" 	                 of one of the senior bank staff members, VP Shahid&#13;

                force's report was to greatly tighten the links between EDI&#13;
                and the World Bank.     World Bank staff now became involved&#13;
                through task forces, and joint committees in determining&#13;

&amp;#12;                               -   14 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
curricula. This had not been the case before.          They had&#13;
always been involved, from day one, in participating in and&#13;
in leading seminars, but never in determining the curricula.&#13;
After this development, EDI became much more of a salesman of&#13;
the Bank's views than had been the case in the earlier days.&#13;
This shift to a promotional function shows how far EDI has&#13;
moved from its original conception.&#13;
     On the other hand, the EDI in recent years has become a&#13;
substantial publisher of books and training materials.            (Of&#13;
course, I can't attest as to their quality, but the volume is&#13;
there and some   I   know are good.)      This is what Alec hoped for&#13;
when he laid out the EDI, but it didn't happen for some time.&#13;
We also hoped the EO! would become a haven for Bank staff,&#13;
providing them with year-long "laureatships" during which&#13;
they would reflect and write.       I   don't know how many.of them&#13;
have been given--if any.&#13;
Q:   Yes.&#13;
A;   You asked about my role when I was in EDI.          You will&#13;
remember that the first Director was Alec Cairncross (now Sir&#13;
Alec) who was world renowned in his field.         The second staff&#13;
member was John Adler who was a principal economist in the&#13;
World Bank and also well known.         Each of them was known for&#13;
his expertise in several areas.         The way we divided the work&#13;
among us .in that first course was that they took every series&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 15 Â­&#13;
&#13;
of seminars in subjects they were well versed in, and I took&#13;
everything else.     As a result, you will discover, if you look&#13;
back at the first and second years' curricula, I ran the&#13;
course on agriculture.     I also had the seminar on historical&#13;
examples of development, which is what I want to comment on&#13;
in a moment.   I also had the seminars on public&#13;
administration and management.    Neither John nor Alec&#13;
considered himself expert or deeply interested in these&#13;
subjects, so I took them, plus some others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I did other odds and ends.    For instance, in the course&#13;
on financial policy and financial institutions, I conducted&#13;
the seminars on development banking.     And it was indeed as a&#13;
paper for discussion at the first seminar on that subject,&#13;
that I prepared the draft of what became my first book on&#13;
development banks.    That is the origin of it.&#13;
     I look back now at what I did in the seminar on&#13;
historical examples, and I find that it was pretty primitive.&#13;
I guess my problem was that I still had relatively little&#13;
conception of the development process or of the problems&#13;
facing the developing world, even though I had already been&#13;
working in the World Bank for 10 years.    I tried in the first&#13;
seminar, which I conducted myself, to provide an overall&#13;
framework but it was primitive.    Then we had case studies on&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 16 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, United states and Mexico.&#13;
I prepared the introductory papers on these, but we had&#13;
outside, eminent scholars to conduct them.&#13;
     Looking back on it, I feel I was pretty naive in running&#13;
a history course.    It wasnft really a history course, but a&#13;
series of cases of development.        Today I would not do that.&#13;
I would try to provide some kind of general framework, much&#13;
better than the one that I prepared for the first seminar.          I&#13;
remember that I sent my draft to my brother and he sent it&#13;
back to me with very little comment.        I should have taken&#13;
that as the indication of its value.        This is the brother&#13;
that was the professor of History at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Columbia.   He said, "Very interesting lf , or words to that 
&#13;
effect. 
&#13;
Q;   Is this sigmund? 
&#13;
A:   Yes, Sigmund.   I feel I did a much better job in&#13;
organizing the agricultural course and in preparing the&#13;
documentation for it.     I think we had a valid conception,&#13;
which I reflected, of the fundamental role of agriculture in&#13;
the development process.    And of the links between&#13;
agriculture and the rest of the economy        and the role of&#13;
credit which by that time was--no, EDI started up before&#13;
agricultural credit became an important subject in the world&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 17 Â­&#13;
&#13;
Bank, which didn't happen until George Woods became president&#13;
in 1963.&#13;
Q:   While we move to intellectual questions, let me ask you&#13;
a broad question about the Bank's view of economic&#13;
development, because you are touching on this, for right now.&#13;
It seems that what you are saying is that the Bank's view of&#13;
economic development obviously changed over time and we would&#13;
like to know what you think about these changes and the way&#13;
the Bank uses economic development today as opposed to,&#13;
perhaps, when you first started or ended your career.&#13;
A:   Well, let me start by saying that one often hears of a&#13;
dichotomy or an opposition between being a bank and between&#13;
being a development institution.       A dichotomy which I guess&#13;
McNamara popularized in a famous statement he made to a swiss&#13;
newspaper man in 1968 just before the first time he presided&#13;
over an Annual Meeting.    He said that, If I had wanted to&#13;
join a bank I would have joined a bank, but I wanted to join&#13;
a development agency.     The next day the Treasurer of The&#13;
World Bank resigned because he thought that statement would&#13;
hurt the sale of bank bonds.&#13;
     r think that is a false dichotomy.      The Bank always has&#13;
been a development-oriented institution.      You go back to the&#13;
early days, once the Bank switched from reconstruction to&#13;
development, which was in 1948, to the earliest speeches of&#13;
&amp;#12;                             - 18 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Black and other senior people and you can see that&#13;
development, raising the level of living of the developing&#13;
world, was seen as the Bank's underlying mission.&#13;
     What changed, however, was the conception of the&#13;
development process and how you go about stimulating that&#13;
improvement in living conditions.     In the early days, senior&#13;
Bank staff, and officials were very much oriented towards the&#13;
private sector, as they are today; but it was an orientation&#13;
based, not on experience of the developing world, but largely&#13;
on ideology and also on what they had seen in the United&#13;
states, especially in the 20s and 30s.&#13;
     Today, the orientation towards the private sector has a&#13;
somewhat different basis.   I wouldn't like to say that Reagan&#13;
had nothing to do with the return of the World Bank to its&#13;
intellectual origins.   But the primary factor has been the&#13;
Bank 1 s own experience of the developing world.   Another&#13;
point.   Although from the start, in speeches and annual&#13;
reports, there was much talk about the elements that are&#13;
necessary to establish and to maintain an environment of&#13;
encouragement and support for private activities, in fact,&#13;
lending was more or less divorced from those policy&#13;
prescriptions.   Lending didn't have much to do with policy.&#13;
Today, a sea-change seems to have occurred.    There seems now&#13;
to be relatively little emphasis on lending   ~~.      There is&#13;
&amp;#12;                            - 19 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a great deal more emphasis on the creation of the enabling&#13;
environment.   One can get the impression that capital is&#13;
being transferred (I'm exaggerating this no doubt) as a bribe&#13;
for changes in policies rather than for the creation of&#13;
productive facilities.&#13;
     NOw, I say there has been a big change in the&#13;
orientation of theBank over the last 46 years, but one must&#13;
not think of this as something that happened suddenly on&#13;
April 1, 1968, the date on which McNamara became president.&#13;
On the contrary, there was a gradual transformation through&#13;
the Black and Woods administrations.    without losing its&#13;
focus, without reducing its lending on projects, the Bank&#13;
devoted more attention to education, health, and matters&#13;
related to a productive environment.    If McNamara did&#13;
anything in this regard, he articulated them into a single&#13;
thesis focussed on improving human resources and reducing&#13;
poverty, and insisted on measures to raise the Bank's image&#13;
to the public and in the eyes of members governments.      The&#13;
size of the Bank's activity grew under his impetus.       Its&#13;
weight and its influence increased.    This was, it seems to&#13;
me, McNamara's main and most important contribution.      The&#13;
rearticulation of the Bank's mission and the quantum leap in&#13;
its volume of lending took place over a period of at least&#13;
five, and maybe 10 years.   Perhaps one should add that, in&#13;
&amp;#12;                               -   20 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the process, the Bank was politicized.&#13;
Q:   So you are saying that before McNamara, the Bank had to&#13;
take a more unilateral approach, a more single-minded kind of&#13;
approach to development, whereas under McNamara -Â­&#13;
A:   Well, let's not say under McNamara.       Originally, the&#13;
Bank felt that, if you provided roads, improved port&#13;
facilities and railways so that goods could reach market and&#13;
be exported: if you provided irrigation facilities so that&#13;
water could be brought to the dry areas; and provided&#13;
electric power, that the very existence of these facilities&#13;
would stimulate farmers and entrepreneurs to produce. They&#13;
would be attracted by the opportunities opening up, and would&#13;
act on it.   I don't think we put enough emphasis on the need&#13;
for improving training, education, basic education as well as&#13;
technical education.   We didn't see the link to health, nor&#13;
did we see the importance of incentives, and laws regarding&#13;
accounting, legal procedures, corporate behavior, etc.&#13;
     I say, "didn't see" it!       That's not quite right.       You&#13;
can see it in the Annual Reports of The World Bank.          I&#13;
particularly recommend to you Annual Reports number 3, 4 and&#13;
5, which are very good on this subject, especially 3.            You&#13;
see a great deal of this in the general survey missions,&#13;
which the World Bank sponsored from about 1950 until 1965.&#13;
You know what I mean by "general survey missions"?       Every one&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 21 Â­&#13;
&#13;
of them had someone on it dealing with education.     A lot of&#13;
them had someone dealing with health.     All of them dealt with&#13;
incentives.    Many of them dealt with entrepreneurial&#13;
training.     But there was a big gap between what the Bank&#13;
required in principle and its willingness to lend.       creditÂ­&#13;
worthiness was the main factor in lending, and the&#13;
availability of a "source" project.     Loans were not generally&#13;
linked to policy.     Actions along policy lines were perhaps&#13;
considered to be general conditions, but not conditions&#13;
precedent to lending.&#13;
     However, beginning before McNamara, and continuing much&#13;
more after him, there was much more emphasis than ever before&#13;
on the creation of the enabling environment and requiring&#13;
actions with respect to the enabling environment as&#13;
conditions for making loans.&#13;
Q:   When you say environment, you are talking about in many&#13;
ways the financial environment?&#13;
A:   The business environment, the environment for&#13;
enterprise.     I am not talking about clean air and the like.&#13;
Q:   HoW does this differ from the conditionality that the&#13;
A:   Well, it is part of the conditionality.     The Whole&#13;
subject of conditionality is a complex one, and I'm not the&#13;
best person to speak to about that.&#13;
     I see this as an important movement. It didn't start at&#13;
&amp;#12;                             -   22 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a particular moment, but it gradually dawned on the top Bank&#13;
officials.    It was a result of what they saw around them.&#13;
After all, by the time Woods became president of the World&#13;
Bank in 1963, Black had been president for 13 years.     He had&#13;
virtually no experience except as a tourist outside the&#13;
united states before then, but afterwards he traveled a great&#13;
deal outside the United States, and he saw the results of&#13;
Bank loans.    Woods also traveled a great deal outside of the&#13;
United states, on business, very often as a World Bank&#13;
consultant.&#13;
     In this connection, let met stick my neck out on&#13;
something.    When the World Bank started, almost everyone in&#13;
the Bank came from Europe or the United states.     Europe was&#13;
too busy getting its own economic house in order.     There were&#13;
very few people from the developing world.     That is one&#13;
point.   Also, virtually everyone who arrived in those first&#13;
10-15 years had experience working someplace else before.&#13;
They didn't start life in the World Bank.     Most of them had&#13;
experience someplace else, in government or in business.&#13;
sometimes good experience, sometimes not so good.&#13;
     Today, on the other hand, you have a different&#13;
situation.    I don't know what the exact percentages are, but&#13;
the proportion of Americans and Europeans is much smaller&#13;
than it was in the early years.     The number of people from&#13;
&amp;#12;                                - 23 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the developing world is far greater.         But what may be a&#13;
greater difference is that, if you take a look at the senior&#13;
people in the World Bank today, most of them started life in&#13;
the World Bank.      They never worked anywhere else.       This&#13;
situation, it seems to me, is a bad thing.         On the one hand&#13;
they have the experience of the World Bank under their belts,&#13;
but it is more an intellectual experience.        They lack the&#13;
life-based experience of having worked elsewhere, be it in&#13;
the private or the public sector.&#13;
Q:     They lack a comparative perspective.&#13;
A:     A broader perspective.&#13;
Q:     Talking about people in this way, raises another set of&#13;
questions related to the fundamental        relations~ips   in the&#13;
Bank and your experience of these rather broad, important&#13;
relationships.      Especially that between the staff and the&#13;
Board.     The question I would like to ask about this is:&#13;
Having been a member of management, what was your view of&#13;
your responsibility to     t~~also              your view of your&#13;
responsibility to the Board?&#13;
A:     Well, there is no question about where my responsibility&#13;
lay.      It was not with the Board.     It was to the President of&#13;
the World Bank.      It is true, he is Chairman of the Board, but&#13;
he was the Chief Executive Officer and he was head of the&#13;
stafOf.    In my view, there just can I t be any question about&#13;
&amp;#12;                                 - 24 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
this.     When it comes to how r felt towards the Board, a great&#13;
deal depended upon the individual Board member.        with some r&#13;
could and did become very friendly.        A great deal also&#13;
depended upon the temper of the times.        There were times, for&#13;
instance, when we were told, if a question was raised by a&#13;
Board member we had to let our supervisors (I don't remember&#13;
how far up it went) know in advance and get his agreement .to&#13;
our visiting the Board member.&#13;
        In those times, 11m sure, that, being a fairly careful&#13;
fellow, I followed the rule most of the time, not always,&#13;
because with some Board members, one develops a friendship&#13;
and a good relationship.        However, one always had to be&#13;
polite to them.     One had to try to answer their questions,&#13;
but you had to be careful.        Remember, they did not have and&#13;
still, I suppose, do not have access to the World Bank's&#13;
files.     Is that correct?&#13;
Q:      That is correct, yes.    They do get a great deal more&#13;
stuff today than they did before.&#13;
A:      I Know, more than they can read.     You had to maintain a&#13;
certain degree of confidentiality.        You had to have a feel of&#13;
what you could talk about openly and what you must not talk&#13;
about openly.     Also, the Executive Directors were the&#13;
representatives of the owners yet, they weren't the people to&#13;
whom you were responsible.        If you had a problem with them,&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 25 Â­&#13;
&#13;
it had to be solved by the President or somebody in the&#13;
presidential line.&#13;
     When one speaks of the relationship of staff to Board,&#13;
you have to distinguish between whether you mean individual&#13;
Board members or the Board as an institution.     Another kind&#13;
of distinction you must make concerns the object of the&#13;
discussions:   policy or individual operational matters.        I&#13;
had a close relationship with several Board members.      But&#13;
there was one in my time whom I want to mention particularly.&#13;
He was outstanding from the point of view of both types of&#13;
issues.   This was Peter Lieftinck of the Netherlands.     He was&#13;
a professor of economics before the war. I believe he was in&#13;
a prison camp for part, if not all of the war. He was also&#13;
the first post-war Finance Minister l who was responsible for&#13;
what came to be called the miracle of the Netherlands, in the&#13;
first five or six years after the war.&#13;
     Peter (now dead about four years) was always an&#13;
extremely useful member of the Board for staff.    He was an&#13;
avid reader and a very intelligent person.   He was maybe the&#13;
only the board member, who had read all the papers.      He never&#13;
missed, in my experience, commenting on the project or the&#13;
economic report or the policy issue, not from the point of&#13;
view of criticizing, of tearing apart, of tearing dOwn, but&#13;
of making helpful comments.    He might be critical of what had&#13;
&amp;#12;                              -    26 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
been done or what was proposed, but he was critical from a&#13;
point of view of indicating to you what you ought to be doing&#13;
differently the next time.        I think that, not only I, but&#13;
most staff members listened carefully to what Peter Lieftinck&#13;
said.     There were others of importance like this, but nobody&#13;
to match him.&#13;
        By the way, he was at one point a staff member of the&#13;
Bank.     The day after he left the Finance Ministry, he joined&#13;
the World Bank.     Later in his career he was a Board member of&#13;
both the Fund and the Bank at the same time.&#13;
Q:      Was there any American board member that you were&#13;
particularly close to?&#13;
A:      Yes, but not in the same way.     Lieftinck was&#13;
independent.     While in voting, where voting was necessary,&#13;
he, no doubt, spoke for the governments that he represented.&#13;
(About four:     The Netherlands, YUgoslavia, Israel, Turkey, if&#13;
I remember correctly.)     However, usually when he commented on&#13;
something, it was Lieftink himself that you were listening&#13;
to.&#13;
        There was an American executive director, Livingston&#13;
Merchant, that I knew quite well because I had worked with&#13;
him during the war.     We were on a committee, he from the&#13;
state Department, and I from the Foreign Economic&#13;
Administration.     I could see him any time and called him by&#13;
&amp;#12;                               -   27 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
h~s   first name, and vice-versa.     But even if he didn't&#13;
mention the fact that he was speaking for the U.s., you knew&#13;
that he was.     Whether he had freedom to do otherwise, I donlt&#13;
know.     For this you must look into the relationship between&#13;
the NAC, the National Advisory Council, not the Neighborhood&#13;
Advisory Council and the American Board members.&#13;
Q:      It is the same neighborhood though?&#13;
A:      Well, you know what a NAC is since you live here in&#13;
Washington.     I had a very close relationship with the Turkish&#13;
executive directors in the early days, because I had already&#13;
had a long association with Turkey, going back to 1943.           But&#13;
it wasnlt the same kind of thing.         I could talk to them.    I&#13;
felt that I could answer their questions, certainly the&#13;
questions of one of them, very freely, but not the other.&#13;
The relationship was not like the one with Lieftinck.         I&#13;
think two of the Canadian EDs in my time spoke for themselves&#13;
often, and not only just for the Canadian government, except,&#13;
of course, when it came to issues such as whether the capital&#13;
of the Bank should be increased or IDA should be replenished&#13;
and by how much.     But on operational matters they spoke for&#13;
themselves.     Does that answer your question?&#13;
Q:      Yes, very well.   Turning back to McNamara, I wanted to&#13;
ask you, especially now after 15 years away from the Bank,&#13;
how you would assess the contributions of Presidents Black,&#13;
&amp;#12;                               - 28 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Woods and McNamara.&#13;
A:   Well, these were three very different people.        With&#13;
Black I think the main feeling inspired among staff was&#13;
affection.     with Woods the main feeling inspired among staff,&#13;
I am told, was dislike.     As you well know from my reaction to&#13;
the biography that is now in the making about Woods,&#13;
obviously, a lot of people did dislike him.        I personally&#13;
never sensed that dislike among my colleaguesf and, if it&#13;
existed, I certainly didn't share it.        But he was very&#13;
different from Black.     Finally, about McNamara, I suppose the&#13;
main feeling was respect, tinged with a bit of fear.&#13;
Respect/fear, something like that.&#13;
     Black was a very gentle and soft-spoken person.           neither&#13;
Board members nor staff had to argue with him too much.           He&#13;
would listen and go his own way.        I don't think it made a&#13;
great deal of difference to him, certainly not in the early&#13;
years, what Board members thought.&#13;
     In the case of Woods, he argued aggressively with Board&#13;
members.     He was very blunt and outspoken.     He was from the&#13;
city streets, from Brooklyn.     He kept staff at arm's length.&#13;
That is also very clear, I think, from the biography in the&#13;
making, too.&#13;
     McNamara was all automation, a numbers cruncher; I guess&#13;
that phrase has been used for him very frequently.        He was&#13;
&amp;#12;                            -   29 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
quite a different person from Black and Woods.&#13;
     I feel that Black's main contributions were something&#13;
that had to be done at the very beginning and that was to&#13;
assure that the Bank would have an adequate supply of&#13;
capital.   He focused on the development of the Bank's&#13;
liabilities and on their management.     Woods knew where the&#13;
capital was coming from, except capital for IDA, for which he&#13;
had to struggle a great deal.    He knew the bank's capital was&#13;
safeguarded and he could get it; the Bank was adequately&#13;
credit-worthy.   What was of greater concern to him was how&#13;
the Bank's resources were to be used.     While he was&#13;
President, you find a great broadening, not so much of the&#13;
volume of Bank commitments, but of the range of activities&#13;
that the Bank dealt with and the creation of the economic&#13;
staff which he felt was absolutely essential in order to&#13;
justly and fairly allocate IDA resources.     This, I think, was&#13;
Woods' contribution.&#13;
     In due course, Black also became interested in expanding&#13;
the range of the Bank's activity.      There was a big difference&#13;
between Black in his first five years and Black in his last&#13;
five years.   He had already become what was called the&#13;
development statesman.   He was also beginning to be&#13;
interested in broadening the Bank's horizons.&#13;
     McNamara's contribution"    for better or for worse, was,&#13;
&amp;#12;                               -   30 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
first, making the elimination of poverty the central mission&#13;
of the world Bank.     I remember people saying, you don't find&#13;
poverty in the Articles of Association.         That is true.   It&#13;
doesn't appear in the charter of the Bank.          But it was his&#13;
interpretation, the meaning that he decided to give to&#13;
development.   There was justice in that, and it was quickly&#13;
and broadly accepted.&#13;
     Secondly, he raised the profile of the World Bank.          It&#13;
became an institution of public attention, public discussion,&#13;
and public controversy throughout the world.          So much so that&#13;
a bomb can be set off outside his hotel, in Copenhagen, in&#13;
1970, I guess it was.    The left wing was beginning to notice&#13;
the Bank and thought it wasn't fighting against trickle-down&#13;
fast enough.   The Bank assumed a higher profile partly&#13;
because of McNamara's rhetoric but also because of its&#13;
increasing volume of operations.          commitments were just under&#13;
a billion dollars in Woods' last year, and I guess when&#13;
McNamara left it must have been already, including IDA, to 15&#13;
billion.   Or close to that.       In any event, it was a&#13;
tremendous increase.&#13;
     Accompanying the raised profile and the increased volume&#13;
and weight of the Bank and the growing importance of IDA--was&#13;
the politicization of the Bank.       That process had started&#13;
earlier.   Indeed, the creation of IDA involved a certain&#13;
&amp;#12;                               - 31 Â­&#13;
&#13;
degree of politicization and certainly the regular IDA&#13;
replenishments always involved political issues.&#13;
        With these increases in size and weight, staff increased&#13;
greatly.     I don't remember what it was when Woods left the&#13;
presidency, but there was a very large staff expansion under&#13;
McNamara, which meant problems of bureaucracy in the bad&#13;
sense of the term, and of administrative coordination.        There&#13;
was never a problem of control under McNamaraJ but of&#13;
coordination, yes.&#13;
Q:      It's an important distinction!&#13;
A:      Because he kept his finger on all the nuts and bolts.&#13;
He was able to intellectually do so, plus he had the&#13;
inclination.     So, I would like to repeat that the movement&#13;
from Black to Woods to McNamara did not involve sharp breaks.&#13;
The Economics staff, for instance, sustained a big push under&#13;
McNamara.     It was diminished under Black from where it had&#13;
begun in 1946. It's role was enhanced under Woods, for a&#13;
variety of reasons.     McNamara, however, increased it even&#13;
more, and unjustifiably gets the credit for it all.&#13;
A:      Why was McNamara feared?&#13;
Q:      Well, he was a tough boss.   It was difficult to talk to&#13;
him.     At least I couldn't nor could many of the people I&#13;
knew.     I imagine there were people, but there couldn't have&#13;
been many, on the Bank staff to whom he listened and reacted&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 32 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
normally.     I must admit that my evidence of this, in some&#13;
cases, comes from a man who claimed that McNamara listened to&#13;
him.    We both (speaking to Kraske) know at least one.     I've&#13;
never known whether that was true or not.     Part of his&#13;
instrument of control was the new planning that he instituted&#13;
in the World Bank. The establishment of lending plans, yearÂ­&#13;
by-year, with a check being made by his "delegate" at monthly&#13;
meetings with each regional department, to discover where its&#13;
"plan" stood.    This wasn't simply a matter of updating the&#13;
loan schedule.    You had a critical path to follow; and if one&#13;
critical point was being delayed, you had to explain why.&#13;
There was an atmosphere of pressure.     In speaking of fear, I&#13;
don't mean fear of being fired.     It was the attitude, the&#13;
atmosphere.&#13;
Q:     Under his tenure, the Board increased in size.     The&#13;
Board developed a staff and increased its work, but do you&#13;
think he paid more attention to the Board than perhaps his&#13;
predecessors did?&#13;
A:     I don't know.   The relationship between the President of&#13;
the Board is a complex one, having to do with politics as&#13;
well as the personal chemistry.&#13;
       Black, although he paid little attention to the Board, I&#13;
believe was very much liked by the Directors.    He was smooth.&#13;
       Woods always argued with them.   There were Directors who&#13;
&amp;#12;                            - 33 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
disliked him and whom he disliked, and this was well known.&#13;
You could see the sparks flying across the room.      The Latin&#13;
American director from Colombia, Jorge Mejia palacios, and he&#13;
thoroughly disliked each other.   The Presidents were very&#13;
different people.   In Woods' case, he had the habit of&#13;
calling a spade a spade and, on top of that, he was ill.      He&#13;
had to have an emergency operation for an aortic aneurism&#13;
that was about to burst in his abdomen.   That no doubt&#13;
affected his bearing.&#13;
     There is another factor, woods had to worry much more&#13;
than Black ever did about IDA.    IDA was established in 1960&#13;
under Black.   The first replenishment consisted of&#13;
supplemental contributions to the original funding:     this was&#13;
accomplished in somethinq over a year, I think.    But the&#13;
second replenishment, whose negotiation started under Woods&#13;
had very tough going.   It was supposed to have taken place&#13;
quickly and easily in a year or two.    But, in fact, it wasn't&#13;
completed until 1969, a year after Woods left.&#13;
     Once IDA was underway, every time you came back for more&#13;
money you were in the midst of political issues because IDA&#13;
replenishment had to go to the legislatures of the donor&#13;
members.   It immediately was involved, not only with local&#13;
politics, but also with the local economic situation, as was&#13;
discovered during the negotiation of the second&#13;
&amp;#12;                              -   34 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
replenishment.     The U.S. tried to introduce conditions&#13;
related to its deficit balance of payments situation-Â­&#13;
conditions which would restrict the impact of IDA&#13;
disbursement on U.S. payments.&#13;
        In relations with the Board, I guess, McNamara was&#13;
somewhere between Black &amp; Woods.         For one thing, you should&#13;
remember, McNamara did something that the other two had not&#13;
done.     He built up for himself a constituency in the&#13;
developing world.     McNamara couldn't avoid being concerned&#13;
with where the united states stood, but much more than the&#13;
others he was interested in developing votes for his&#13;
constituency in the Third World, whose representatives made&#13;
up most of the members of the Board.        When he began talking&#13;
about stepping up of Bank commitments, the stress on poverty&#13;
alleviation, the increase in IDA replenishments, all this was&#13;
very popular in the developing world and that view was&#13;
reflected in the attitude of Board members towards him.&#13;
However, it takes a great many Board members from developing&#13;
countries to outweigh the U.S. Executive Director when an&#13;
issue has to come to a vote, which it rarely does.&#13;
Q:      As I listen to you talking about these presidents I&#13;
detect warm feelings and positive assessments towards Black,&#13;
but there must have been a downside.&#13;
A:      I can't think of one to tell the truth.     None comes to&#13;
&amp;#12;                               - 35 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mind.     Of course, nobody' is perfect, but I canlt think of an&#13;
important downside.&#13;
Q:      You don't seem to have that problem with McNamara.&#13;
A:      He knew the business, or thought he knew the business of&#13;
most of us, much better that we did and often he was right.&#13;
[To Kraske] Is that exaggerating?       One may argue about the&#13;
"often".     But he certainly thought he knew better.    I stopped&#13;
going to his Board meetings after I left the Bank in 178.&#13;
You continued going to his meetings for another three or four&#13;
years, until he left in f81.     And every meeting of his&#13;
President's Council that I attended was dominated by him.&#13;
The Vice Presidents at the time would know better because&#13;
they attended many more meetings than I did.       But that was my&#13;
impression.&#13;
Q:      What about the atmosphere or the culture of working at&#13;
the Bank during your time there?&#13;
A:      I wanted to make a point about that.   Under Black, at&#13;
the start, I stressed assuring the adequacy of capital which&#13;
meant mobilizing and safeguarding the liabilities.       But there&#13;
was another important thing and it was here I think that the&#13;
fundamental culture or the first culture, at least, of the&#13;
Bank was established.     The care exercised (maybe not always&#13;
effectively) in project selection and evaluation.       I say, not&#13;
always effectively, because there have always been different&#13;
&amp;#12;                               - 36 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
views about project evaluation, but the point is, the loan&#13;
had to be subjected to intensive examination before and then&#13;
had to be the subject of critical supervision in the years of&#13;
implementation.     To some extent, that was the result of the&#13;
mandates of the Articles of Association.      Those mandates,&#13;
however, focused on the specific project to try to make sure&#13;
that the project is "sound ll , and that the goods purchased&#13;
with the proceeds of the loan are used for that project&#13;
alone.     This was the result of one of the lessons of foreign&#13;
lending in the 20s and 30s, when loans were, to a&#13;
considerable extent, made on faith and defaults were common.&#13;
You didn't know how they were being used.      Here you must not&#13;
forget the man who was Black's only Vice President until&#13;
1956:     Robert Garner.&#13;
        Garner was the inside man.   He ran the staff.   He was&#13;
the chairman of the staff Loan Committee.      Black himself, did&#13;
not, I believe, pay a great deal of attention to individual&#13;
operations.     He was the CEO and the Bank was being run the&#13;
way he wanted it run.      It was Garner who established the&#13;
procedures, who played a key role in the selection of staff,&#13;
who deserves much of the credit for the establishment of the&#13;
culture of the early decades.&#13;
Q:      Obviously, there is difference in size and bureaucracy&#13;
and hierarchy as time goes on, as the staff gets larger.          But&#13;
&amp;#12;                             -   37 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
how would you characterize the relationships that people had?&#13;
Were they familial in the sense of a law firm or a&#13;
university, or were they more business-like, more like&#13;
working in a bank, a private bank or in a large corporation?&#13;
A:   Well, you are asking me to make a comparison with&#13;
institutions that I have never worked for.&#13;
Q:   Well, you associate with people who do, your brother at&#13;
the university, for example.&#13;
A:   Your question is difficult to reply to.     There was&#13;
certainly a degree of collegiality at the senior staff level&#13;
in the first decades.    This was supposed to be assured by the&#13;
staff Loan committee, of which Garner was the chairman.      And&#13;
later Burke Knapp, after Garner became the President of IFC.&#13;
Here is where the senior staff involved in any operation, any&#13;
major discussions of policy, came together to discuss issues.&#13;
But in the end, it was Garner, or Knapp, who drew the&#13;
conclusions.   sometimes they took into account what had been&#13;
said around the table, sometimes they didn't.     But I had the&#13;
feeling that the process was reasonably collegial.&#13;
     At a lower level, there was a great deal of interchange&#13;
among staff members.    The Bank was a small organization.    You&#13;
could see everybody every day.     You could stand at the&#13;
elevators on the first floor of 1818 H street, Building A,&#13;
which is now about to be torn down, and you could see&#13;
&amp;#12;                               - 38 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
everybody in the World Bank and every body at the IMF, four&#13;
times a day, when they arrived and left work and when they&#13;
went out to lunch and returned.         It was small enough so that&#13;
you knew almost everyone.     This nintimacy", if I can call it&#13;
that, went on for some time, certainly until the beginning of&#13;
the sixties.&#13;
        When McNamara regionalized the Bank, the staff grew&#13;
large.     Interchange was reduced and coordination became more&#13;
formal, but also more difficult to achieve.        I had the&#13;
impression that personnel from one region saw relatively&#13;
little of those from another region.        And, indeed, the way in&#13;
which they carried out the management's policies on some&#13;
SUbjects, seemed to diverge.&#13;
Q:      How did the working culture at IMF differ from that at&#13;
the Bank?&#13;
A:      I really don't know the answer to that.     Of course I&#13;
know people in the Fund, but I never had a close working&#13;
relationship with them.     To some extent, that reflects the&#13;
attitude of the Bank towards the Fund in the first 25 or so&#13;
years.     It is only in more recent years, I believe, that they&#13;
have begun to overlap operationally and often to come into&#13;
conflict with each other.     Bank staff would have much more&#13;
intimate contact with Fund staff today than they had in my&#13;
time.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                -   39 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:      I don't want to press too much on this, but we are&#13;
interested in this whole question of atmosphere and the&#13;
culture.     How did people display ambition in working at the&#13;
Bank?&#13;
A:      I believe that, in the first 20 years or so, people&#13;
liked working in the Bank.       They felt that they were doing&#13;
something important and that they had a say in it.         I&#13;
certainly felt that.       To some extent, this was because the&#13;
Bank was starting out and most things were being done for the&#13;
first time.      Also it was small, so you could see operations&#13;
moving or not moving as the case may be.        There was a general&#13;
feeling that this was a special place to work.         You must keep&#13;
in mind, however, that to elderly gentlemen the good days are&#13;
generally the good old days.&#13;
        Judging from what I hear from Bank friends that I see&#13;
frequently, that is no longer the case.        I asked a fellow,&#13;
two weeks ago, a Pakistani, who has been here now for 20-25&#13;
years, whether, if he were 20-25 years younger, he would want&#13;
to join the Bank.      He said, nDefinitely not. II   He would not&#13;
recommend it to his son either.        Again, this attitude is to&#13;
some    e~tent   a consequence of the Bank's size, and to some&#13;
extent a consequence of its complexity.        It is hard to know&#13;
the whole Bank, even for an insider, to say nothing of an&#13;
outsider, because there is such diversity in the matters&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 40 Â­&#13;
&#13;
dealt with by the Bank, such a diversity of products that it&#13;
offers.     I think the administrative freedom of choice of&#13;
people in the Bank is far less today than it was before.&#13;
Again, partly a consequence of size.&#13;
       I'm told that griping is a normal way of life in&#13;
virtually all large institutions.      Maybe the griping is a&#13;
little worse here because the Bank doesn't produce uniform&#13;
products.    The products put out are generally custom-made and&#13;
staff therefore feel that they as individuals should have an&#13;
opportunity to provide some significant input.      I have the&#13;
impression it is not a happy staff.      I know people who griped&#13;
30 years ago, too.&#13;
0:     Turning from 30 years to recent times.   We would like to&#13;
know a little about what work you have been doing since you&#13;
left the Bank.    Your consulting work in particular.&#13;
A:.    I would suggest, and my wife would insist, that you&#13;
don't call it retirement.    She maintains that I'm doing more&#13;
now than I used to do.    But part of the impression that she&#13;
has and which even I have occasionally, results from the fact&#13;
that everything now takes me much more time to do than it did&#13;
20 years ago.    lIm told that is not a unique experience among&#13;
people of my age.&#13;
       The day I left the Bank I already had a contract for a&#13;
job.    I have always refused to take a long-term job or one&#13;
&amp;#12;                             - 41 Â­&#13;
&#13;
that involved management or administrative responsibility.          I&#13;
wanted short assignments; they could go on for a time, but&#13;
not be full-time assignments.   Until two years ago, I had&#13;
them fairly regularly from the Bank.   Every year I signed on&#13;
for two or three, which might involve one or two month's&#13;
work, part-time.   There were very few things to which I&#13;
devoted full-time, except, for my 1988 paper regarding Bank&#13;
history, and my appointment with the IFe.&#13;
     These assignments, were Often, but not always, in the&#13;
area of financial institutions and development finance&#13;
companies, which is another word for development banks.       They&#13;
usually involved restructuring an existing institution with&#13;
which I had been involved many years earlier, or the&#13;
promotion of a new one.&#13;
     Aside from these assignments, I have had a few jobs&#13;
outside.   A short one of ten days for the government of Saudi&#13;
Arabia, again, advising on one of their development finance&#13;
institutions.&#13;
     I have had a long engagement for ten years on the board&#13;
of a consulting company in the U.K. which was created and is&#13;
managed by people who I had hired in the Bank but are no&#13;
longer here.    I still continue as an advisor to them, but&#13;
recently I decided that it was time to get off the board.       I&#13;
helped IFe to establish a new investment bank in Portugal,&#13;
&amp;#12;                              - 42 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and served on its board for 10 years.     I continue as an&#13;
advisor; we are in touch by phone and fax.     Things like that.&#13;
     Most of the work, but not all, for the World Bank Group;&#13;
and most of the work, but not all, connected with financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
     By the way, it had always bothered me that I never had a&#13;
oonsulting job in the United states.     It always involved&#13;
foreign institutions.     I always wanted an assignment on&#13;
Amerioan institutions.    One finally came my way, but believe&#13;
it or not it was for the Indians, the American Indians.        So&#13;
there I was back on Indian work.&#13;
Q:   My final question you might think of as being somewhat&#13;
self-indulgent.     But the question is, How has your historical&#13;
training been important to your career at the bank?&#13;
A:   Obviously my reaction to that question has got to be a&#13;
strictly personal one.     I don't think it had anything&#13;
Whatsoever to do with my employment by the World Bank on&#13;
August 11, 1947, although the personnel officer at that time&#13;
was Mike Lejeune, who majored in history in college.&#13;
     So far as my work is concerned, I like to think my&#13;
training in history was a plus--a substantial plus.        First,&#13;
it helped me to gain a broader view of the world and its&#13;
cultures than I would have had, if I had had a more technical&#13;
kind of training.    I am sure that it is a technical training&#13;
&amp;#12;                              -   43 Â­&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
which gets one into the Bank these days, rather than being a&#13;
history Ph.D.    My training at Johns Hopkins was largely&#13;
Europe- and America-oriented.      There was some of the Far&#13;
East; Latin American, only in the colonial period; and Africa&#13;
only in the colonial period.      I had the advantage, as far as&#13;
the Far East was concerned, of taking courses with OWen&#13;
Latimore, so I knew a little bit at least about "the inner&#13;
Asian frontiers of outer Mongolia."      At least at that time I&#13;
knew a bit.     I like to think all this helped in my general&#13;
view of the world and my place in it.&#13;
     Secondly, and maybe this is more important, I think it&#13;
may have helped me in the use of evidence, both documentary&#13;
and oral, in insisting on evidence before I wrote and spoke,&#13;
and before I believed what I read or heard.      The evidence of&#13;
two independent witnesses, not self-deceived, as somebody&#13;
else has said before me.&#13;
     Thirdly, related to this, I would like to think that I&#13;
was and remain a somewhat better writer than most of my&#13;
colleagues, thanks in part to my training in history.&#13;
     My last point, I guess, is that history study helped&#13;
give me a time outloOk.    Everything has a background, which&#13;
background led to where we are today, and today is the&#13;
beginning of tomorrow.     I am not sure that this became an&#13;
automatic part of the thinking of someone who had his&#13;
&amp;#12;                                - 44 Â­&#13;
&#13;
doctorate in chemistry or even in economics at the time that&#13;
I got mine in history.       Maybe it is different today.&#13;
        I guess those are the ways in which, I repeat, I like to&#13;
think history    w~s   of use to me.   I have often said that I&#13;
think it is the best training that one could have.&#13;
Q:      Well, thank you very much.     Actually, I would agree with&#13;
that.&#13;
