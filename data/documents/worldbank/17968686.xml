                          Boskey, Shirley E.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Professor Robert W. Oliver, on 1986-07-14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Boskey joined the Bank after serving for about nine years in the&#13;
U.S. Government as Assistant General Counsel of the Office of&#13;
Territories in the Interior Department. Boskey knew Dick Demuth who,&#13;
at one point, needed an assistant in his department. Boskey briefly&#13;
runs a comparison of the Presidents during whose tenure she served,&#13;
covering mainly their interaction with the staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Boskey began as a staff assistant, in the Technical Assistance&#13;
and Liaison Department, where she stayed--through its many&#13;
departmental name changes--until her retirement from the Bank 29 years&#13;
later. She became the first woman Department Director in 1975;&#13;
succeeding M. Hoffman who became director after Demuth's departure.&#13;
According to Boskey, Demuth was a man of ideas and the new&#13;
organizations created as Bank affiliates either originated with him,&#13;
or were confided to him to work over. Demuth also wrote the speeches&#13;
for the Annual Meeting. The principal responsibility of the department&#13;
was the Bank's relationship with the United Nations. The major&#13;
initiatives Boskey and Demuth were associated with included, drafting&#13;
the proposal to set up the McNamara Fellowship Program under the&#13;
auspices of EDI (Economic Development Institute), and working closely&#13;
with the Legal in designing the IDA Articles of Agreement which the&#13;
Bank's Executive Directors were commissioned to do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Boskey elaborates on the Board meeting informally as the&#13;
Committee of the Whole, where the Directors speak for themselves with&#13;
no vote taken and a Precis circulated as Secretary's memoranda. On the&#13;
other hand, when the Board meets formally, a record of the&#13;
&amp;#12;discussions-a verbatim-is not circulated. However, the minutes&#13;
summarizing the statements related to various Board approvals&#13;
contained in the meetings are circulated to the senior staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Boskey discusses the original proposal for Investment Insurance&#13;
which she jointly worked on with Demuth and the study she wrote in&#13;
1962. This, eventually died after ten years of work within the Legal&#13;
Department to reemerge as the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
(MIGA). She elaborates on MIGA's objective, purpose, rationale, and&#13;
its revival by President Clausen who proposed it in his first Annual&#13;
Meeting speech. Subsequently, Shihata, the Bank's Vice President and&#13;
General Counsel, making it a reality with a new Convention to function&#13;
as an organization separate from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Boskey elaborates on the procedures involved in handling the&#13;
various proposals and subsequent assignments thereof within the Bank;&#13;
some requiring close coordination with the EDs' offices, others when&#13;
work was dictated by the UN might not require Board involvement. The&#13;
assignments handled directly with the President, some came from the&#13;
governments through the President, and some were dealt with by the&#13;
senior staff directly with the governments such as the negotiations&#13;
for IDA Replenishment which were carried out directly with the&#13;
governments or through the IDA Deputies, whereby those of the Part I&#13;
countries would contribute to the Replenishment. However, the IDA&#13;
Articles of Agreement were considered in the Board and worked on in&#13;
close coordination with the Directors. Loan negotiations, are carried&#13;
out with various government representatives where the Board is not&#13;
involved until the lending stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Boskey discusses the notion of IFC (International Finance&#13;
Corporation) emerging in a report prepared outside the Bank and,&#13;
William Diamond writing what might have been the first book, with one&#13;
of the chapters written by Mervyn Weiner. Demuth and Boskey&#13;
subsequently organizing a conference of development bank managers,&#13;
resulting in Boskey producing a second book on development banks based&#13;
&amp;#12;on the precis of the discussions. The financing of development banks&#13;
becoming part of the Bank's activity and a separate department set up&#13;
which then went over to IFC. Boskey elaborates on the concept upon&#13;
which IFC was set up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Boskey mentions Demuth as the Bank's liaison person with outside&#13;
UN-type organizations, the UN Charter providing that organizations in&#13;
the various economic development fields enter into a relationship&#13;
agreement with it. She also talks about the uniqueness of the Bank's&#13;
agreement and its daily relationship with the UN, the Bank's&#13;
agreements with other international organizations, other agreements&#13;
made with the UN and the evolution of the various cooperative&#13;
programs, especially with the UNDP and her involvement therein.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Boskey talks about the Woods era ('63-'68), the introduction of&#13;
the Young Professional Program, the role of the resident missions,&#13;
Demuth taking the lead in organizing various committees comprised&#13;
mostly of senior staff to discuss and consider various initiatives,&#13;
her contribution to the "Development Services Department Newsletter"--&#13;
already in existence since the 60s--until its demise around '73, the&#13;
Horowitz proposal from UNCTAD and her extensive involvement therein&#13;
together with Demuth and Irving Friedman [economic adviser to Woods],&#13;
and her authoring the principal report and the proposal's final&#13;
demise. She mentions other proposals from UNCTAD asking the Bank to do&#13;
studies such as the one handled by Friedman on Supplementary Financing&#13;
and, the reason why it also died. Finally, her participation at the&#13;
meetings of UN agency heads, where on several occasions she sat in for&#13;
the President, as well as writing and delivering the Bank's speech to&#13;
the Economic and Social Council in Geneva.&#13;
