&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the development of the&#13;
&#13;
productive facilities and resources of the Republic of Indonesia and is in the interest of the&#13;
&#13;
Republic of Indonesia and of the members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
3.      Accordingly, the Committee finds that said program merits financial assistance from the&#13;
