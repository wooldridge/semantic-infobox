Attachment I&#13;
(provided for informational purposes only)&#13;
Global Gas Flaring Reduction Public-Private Partnership Charter&#13;
Adopted on September 28, 2009&#13;
Effective on April 26, 2010, as amended&#13;
A. Background&#13;
The World Bank estimates that over 150 billion cubic meters of natural gas associated&#13;
with crude oil production is being flared and vented annually. The flaring and venting of&#13;
natural gas associated with crude oil production and other greenhouse gases associated&#13;
with upstream petroleum operations ("Gas Flaring") wastes energy resources and adds&#13;
the equivalent of 400 million tons of CO2 in annual emissions.&#13;
Launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August 2002, as a Type&#13;
1I public-private partnership the Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership (the "GGFR")&#13;
is committed to reducing Gas Flaring globally as a means to address climate change&#13;
concerns. GGFR participants desire to overcome the barriers to flare reduction by&#13;
sharing global best practices and implementing country specific programs.&#13;
The GGFR facilitates efforts to reduce Gas Flaring globally by promoting effective&#13;
regulatory frameworks, and investments in infrastructure to support gas utilization in&#13;
local and international energy markets. Poverty reduction is an integral part of the GGFR&#13;
program through the supply of clean fuels and the creation of new employment.&#13;
B. Vision&#13;
The GGFR seeks a world free of routine gas flaring and venting.&#13;
C. Mission Statement&#13;
The GGFR is a catalyst for reducing wasteful and undesirable practices of gas flaring and&#13;
venting through policy change, stakeholder facilitation and project implementation.&#13;
D. Activities&#13;
The GGFR focuses on the following activities:&#13;
1 . Global activities&#13;
Global activities include but are not limited to (i) the support, adoption and&#13;
implementation of standards and practices recommended in the GGFR Report&#13;
Number 4, "Voluntary Standard for Global Gas Flaring and Venting Reduction",&#13;
dated May 2004, as may be amended from time to time (the "Voluntary Standard"),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-&#13;
and (ii) the development of recommendations on legal, regulatory, technical and&#13;
fiscal best practices to promote Gas Flaring reduction investments.&#13;
2. Country-specific activities&#13;
Country-specific activities include but are not limited to (i) assistance to governments&#13;
to gather Gas Flaring data from their countries and develop Gas Flaring reduction&#13;
strategies and associated Country Implementation Plans ("CIPs") based on&#13;
Associated Gas Recovery Plans ("AGRPs") prepared by companies, and (ii) the&#13;
promotion of gas commercialization through associated gas utilization reviews,&#13;
demonstration projects, small scale use of gas, development of Liquid Petroleum Gas&#13;
(LPG) recovery projects, and carbon financing.&#13;
3. Dissemination activities&#13;
Dissemination activities include but are not limited to (i) the organization of&#13;
country/regional workshops (for knowledge transfer, best practice dissemination,&#13;
etc.), (ii) the organization of high-level international conferences, (iii) publication of&#13;
reports, and (iv) communication and media outreach.&#13;
E. Participation&#13;
GGFR participants may be Partners or Associated Partners as follows:&#13;
Partners ("Partners") may be (i) governments, (ii) multilateral organizations, (iii) oil&#13;
companies, or (iv) organizations directly involved in promoting and executing Gas&#13;
Flaring reduction actions.&#13;
Associated Partners ("Associated Partners") are participants that do not fit in one of the&#13;
above four categories but seek to support the GGFR Vision and Mission.&#13;
New requests to become a Partner or Associated Partner may be made to the GGFR&#13;
Program Manager (as defined below) who will screen the candidate's request.&#13;
Admission of new Partners or Associated Partners will be subject to participation&#13;
requirements under this Charter and final approval by the Steering Committee.&#13;
F. Participant Commitments&#13;
To the extent applicable, each Partner and each Associated Partner will endeavor to work&#13;
within the scope of its respective rules, regulations and resources to:&#13;
1. Provide annual Gas Flaring data in accordance with the recommendations&#13;
contained in the Voluntary Standard.&#13;
2. Provide expert staff and resources to support Networks and Task Forces (as&#13;
defined below) as needed.&#13;
3. Develop policies and regulations to reduce Gas Flaring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
4. Utilize best practices to reduce Gas Flaring.&#13;
5. Support the development of commercial alternatives to Gas Flaring.&#13;
6. Develop, share and implement best measurement, operating, reporting and&#13;
monitoring practices for associated gases under their control or management.&#13;
7. Collectively support and seek to individually adopt and implement the Voluntary&#13;

H. Organization and Governance&#13;

In the event GGFR continues beyond 2015, potential extensions of the Trust fund may&#13;
be decided by the parties to it and additional funding requirements may be decided by the&#13;
Steering Committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-8-&#13;
Each Partner has the right to be represented by two (2) individuals, whose names will&#13;

between meetings through a no-objection process involving all Partner Members on&#13;
the current CTT list for a reasonable period, considering the decision to be made,&#13;
conducted by the GGFR Program Manager.&#13;
In the event that unanimity cannot be achieved, the chairman of the Steering&#13;
Committee will put forward a process for addressing the issue.&#13;
Associated Partners, non GGFR participants, and additional representatives of&#13;
Partners may attend Steering Committee meetings as observers by invitation of the&#13;
GGFR Program Manager.&#13;

The Technical Network will focus on the technical aspects of oil companies'&#13;
operational best practices concerning Gas Flaring reduction.&#13;
*  Carbon Finance Network&#13;
The Carbon Finance Network will share best practices for obtaining carbon&#13;
credit financing for Gas Flaring reduction projects.&#13;
*  Communication Network&#13;
The Communication Network will work to share Gas Flaring reduction&#13;
successes among Partners and Associated Partners, publicize relevant&#13;
information and promote Gas Flaring reduction events sponsored by the&#13;
GGFR.&#13;
Each Network is comprised of representatives of any interested Partner and/or&#13;
Associated Partner, each of whom may appoint up to two (2) members, whose names&#13;
will be current with the CTT at all times, to participate in the corresponding Network.&#13;
Each Network is led by a Chair who is agreed by the Steering Committee and is&#13;
normally a member of the CTT.&#13;
The members of the Network may also agree on a co-Chair. Decisions are made by&#13;
the same means as decisions by the Steering Committee. Within the scope of the&#13;
specific area for which it was established, each Network develops its own objectives,&#13;

ad-hoc task force ("Task Force") is being created to respond to a need for specific&#13;
information or guidance to support the activities of the GGFR. These teams are led&#13;
by members of the CTT. Membership and decision making for Task Forces will&#13;
otherwise be the same as for Networks.&#13;
Each Network and Task Force will meet in person or through electronic means as often&#13;
as necessary, but normally not less than once every ninety (90) days.&#13;
