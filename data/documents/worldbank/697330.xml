Project Description:    The main goal of the project is to promote sustainable land use in rural areas of&#13;
Punjab by redirecting public sector involvement towards the expansion of agro-forestry&#13;
production systems and the rehabilitation of degraded range and scrub land. The&#13;
project would inter ulia support the following components:&#13;
(a) Institutional Development would include: (i) reviewing the human resources&#13;
available to the forest sector by providing technical assistance and training; (ii)&#13;
improving the research facilities of the Punjab Forest Research Institute by providing&#13;
equipment, training, technical assistance and operating funds; and (iii) strengthening&#13;
PFD's capacity to monitor and evaluate sector development under the project.&#13;
(b) Farm Forestry Expansion would involve: (i) facilitating the transfer of&#13;
technology needed to expand private sector participation in the development of&#13;
sustainable supplies of wood and wood products through strengthening the extension&#13;
capability of the Forest Department with vehicles, equipment, training, and operating&#13;
funds; (ii) facilitating the transfer of information needed to increase smaliholder&#13;
participation in wood markets by providing the PFD with facilities, technical assistance&#13;
and operating funds; (iii) improving the availability of superior planting material by&#13;
providing the Punjab Forest Research Institute (PFRI) with operating funds to&#13;
undertake research on seed quality and to establish model nurseries; and (iv)&#13;
undertaking adaptive research by providing operating funds to conduct species/variety&#13;
trials and improve silviculture practices on farm lands.&#13;
(c) Social Range and Scrub Forests Rehabilitation would entail: (i) rehabilitating&#13;
and improving about 21,400 ha of range and scrub forests in Pothwar (10,200 ha) and&#13;
Thal (11,200 ha); (ii) introducing participatory planning and management systems for&#13;
public range and scrub lands through Community Organizations established in about&#13;
100 villages clustered around selected public reserves (68 villages in Pothwar, 32 in&#13;
Thal); (iii) testing mechanisms for cost recovery to sustain range and scrub&#13;
improvement; (iv) providing training and support to Punjab Forest Department staff&#13;
and farmers to promote a farmer oriented, participatory approach to range&#13;
management; and (v) supporting applied research on fodder trees and shrubs, range&#13;
systems ecology, feed quality, and related social and economic themes.&#13;
- iii -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d) Timber Plantations would cover a pilot component to enhance the positive&#13;
environmental conservation role of irrigated timber plantations and to define optimal&#13;
technical and organizational plans for the sustainable management of the plantations.&#13;
The pilot will involve operations over three plantations representing different&#13;
agroecological conditions and its results would be applicable to Punjab's 62&#13;
plantations.&#13;

Benefits:               The primary benefits of the project include increased rural production, improved&#13;
productivity and environmental quality of forest lands, soil conservation measures, on-&#13;
farm fodder production, improved public sector efficiency in the forest sector, and&#13;
development opportunities for local participation, employment and income. The&#13;
investments in farm forestry research, tree improvement and extension are expected to&#13;
increase mainly the quality of forest raw materials. The project is expected to have&#13;
some dampening effect on environmental degradation in scrub forests, rangelands and&#13;
other forest areas through the rehabilitation of wasteland, pasture development and the&#13;
demonstration of plantation rehabilitation. The project would reduce grazing pressure&#13;
on natural forest areas and enable natural grass and forest cover to re-establish itself&#13;
and provide vegetative growth which would improve the resource base in the project&#13;
area.&#13;
ERR:                    The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project is estimated at 14 percent: ERR of&#13;
the farm forestry component is estimated at 14-19 percent; the return to the social&#13;
range and scrub forests component is estimated at 12 percent.&#13;
Risks:                  For farm forestry the primary risks are: (i) the possibility that the implementation of&#13;
the phase-out programs for seedling subsidies and government nurseries might be&#13;
delayed, which would mean a continued stimulus of wood supplies that is weakly&#13;
attentive to the demand for various types of wood; and (ii) the possibility that the&#13;
relatively small base of farm forestry producers at present would destabilize wood&#13;
markets and so discourage further on-farm expansion of wood supplies. The project&#13;
would address these risks by: (i) obtaining prior government approval of the timed&#13;
phase-out programs for subsidies and public sector nurseries (practically all&#13;
government interference in the sub-sector would be discontinued in time for mid-term&#13;
review and evaluation); (ii) broadening the base of wood producers by directing&#13;
applied research and extension activities towards communities where wood markets do&#13;
not presently operate well for logistical reasons and where incremental production&#13;
would likely be consumed by households; and (iii) contracting a market information&#13;
service in the private sector that would assist the planning of wood users and producers&#13;
and the development of forward contracts between producers and industrial wood&#13;
users. For the range and scrub forests component the primary risk is the reluctance&#13;
of PFD staff accepting a resource management approach for this sub-sector that jointly&#13;
involves the department, private sector and communities in decision making,&#13;
administration and the negotiated sharing of resource benefits. The project will&#13;
address this risk by: (i) providing TA for the facilitation of participatory management&#13;
of scrub/range land through proven micro-planning processes that ensure benefits to all&#13;
stakeholders; and (ii) conducting and implementing the proposed Human Resources&#13;
Development study for the sector. Among its outputs, the study should provide an&#13;

indicative plan for the deployment of public and non-public resources within the&#13;
sector.&#13;
Poverty Category:      Program of Targeted Interventions. The project qualifies for inclusion in the PTI since&#13;
it would be targeting the poor and the proportion of the poor among project&#13;
beneficiaries would likely be larger than their proportion in the overall population. On&#13;
the basis of recent poverty studies, about one third of the rural population in Punjab&#13;
falls near or below several measurements of the poverty line. Most of these rural poor&#13;
are farm households cultivating small areas of land and have not had equal access to&#13;
assistance provided by previous farm forestry campaigns, which have generally&#13;
benefitted the largest land holders. It is therefore likely that over one third of the&#13;
direct beneficiaries of the farm forestry component would come from poor rural&#13;
households. In addition, there would be indirect impacts of the project in the form of&#13;
additional income and employment that would be generated for small farmers (as well&#13;
as for larger landholders) and landless laborers through incremental wood production&#13;
for fuel and industry. The expansion in the supply of fuelwood under the project&#13;
would discourage the increased substitution of dung cakes, an inferior biomass fuel, for&#13;
wood, which, because of the diversion of dung as a manure and soil conditioner would&#13;
over time adversely affect farm productivity and profitability. Also, the social range&#13;
and scrub forest component, by design, aims to improve the incomes of poor, rural&#13;
households reliant on livestock grazing.&#13;

PAKISTAN&#13;
PUNJAB FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
Proiect Identification&#13;
1.01        The Provincial Government of Punjab (GOPunjab) through the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has&#13;
requested International Development Association (IDA) assistance in undertaking institutional reforns and&#13;
operations in the forest sector that would promote, among other objectives, the protection and extension of the&#13;
province's forest resources. Specifically, GOPunjab has expressed interest in comprehensive, sector-wide support&#13;
to: (i) undertake policy reform to facilitate private sector participation in wood production and the management&#13;
of forest resources; (ii) improve the Forest Department's capabilities in social forestry; (iii) rehabilitate and&#13;
increase the sustainable productivity of existing natural and plantation forest resources; and (iv) promote farm&#13;
forestry. GOPunjab prepared the present project in collaboration with the Bank Group and with financial support&#13;
from the Japanese Government.&#13;
Proiect Background&#13;
1.02        The project region will range over most of the province of Punjab.&#13;
1.03        The farm forestry component will involve scattered sites in both irrigated and baran, (rainfed)&#13;
agricultural areas -- but primarily irrigated areas and areas outside Murree, Kahuta and Kotli Sattian --&#13;
throughout the province while the component for scrub forests and rangelands will be restricted to the interior of&#13;
the Pothwar Plateau and Thai.&#13;
1.04        Punjab occupies 20.6 million ha of the upper Indus plain. The plains rise from about 200 m in&#13;
the south up to 300 m at the Pothwar Plateau and into the Murree hills in the north. The climate of the province&#13;
ranges from arid to semi-arid. Average annual rainfall varies from 100 mm in the southern areas to over 1,500&#13;
mm in the northern sub-mountainous tracts and highlands. In most of Punjab the climate is suitable for year-&#13;
round cropping, provided that water supply is not a limiting factor.&#13;
1.05        Five major rivers traverse the plains, providing irrigation water through an extensive system of&#13;
canals. Although the availability of irrigation water in the plain lands is frequently constrained, particularly for&#13;
farmers at the lower reaches of canals, it has established Punjab's dominance within the agricultural sector of&#13;
Pakistan. About 0.2 million tubewells supplement canal irrigation in some areas or substitute for it in others.&#13;
Together about 57 percent of the land in Punjab is cultivated, representing well over half of all agricultural land&#13;
in Pakistan.&#13;
1.06        Pakistan's population is approximately 126 million and is growing at about 3 percent a year.&#13;
Since independence (1947) the population has more than tripled, and by the year 2000 Pakistan will have some&#13;
150 million people. More than 45 percent of the population is under 14 years of age.  Nearly 77 percent of the&#13;
population lives in the Indus River Valley System and almost 70 percent of the country's population is found in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rural areas. Punjab has more than half of the country's population. Of its projected 68.8 million residents, 46.7&#13;
million are rural and 22.1 million urban3!.&#13;
II. ISSUES, OBJECTIVES, STRATEGIES&#13;
Natural Resource Management Issues&#13;
2.01         A critical feature of the problem of natural resource management in Pakistan is that resource&#13;
degradation is not caused by a few, large-scale enterprises, but by the unchecked activities of numerous small&#13;
cultivators or graziers who, because of their numbers, small land holdings, social independence and isolation, are&#13;
difficult to influence. Much of the pressure on forests can be attributed to continuing land clearance for&#13;
agriculture, forest encroachment for grazing and expanded pasture and illegal felling of trees for timber.&#13;
Although wood needs are met primarily outside forests, indigenous forests are in serious decline. Neither&#13;
plantation forestry nor farm forestry would be able to replace biological resources found in them, although they&#13;
would be able to provide many of the same products. Indigenous forests will require greater management and&#13;
protection even if the entire household sector shifts away from fuelwood use towards modem fuels.&#13;
2.02         Forest types in Punjab consist of: (i) natural forests, including conifer, scrub and riverine forests;&#13;
and (ii) plantings on farmland and public lands for fuelwood and commercial timber production.&#13;
A. Natural Forest Resources&#13;
2.03         Conifer Forests. Only 30,000 ha of sparse forest are now left, including the tract enclosing the&#13;
hill resort of Murree, where the influx of visitors during summer aggravates the problem of forest over-cutting.&#13;
In the upland areas where these forests are generally found, soil erosion, land slides and general ecological&#13;
deterioration have set in.&#13;
2.04         This small area is the only source of softwood supply within the province. Against the provincial&#13;
annual consumption of 0.3 million m3 of softwood, these forests presently have the potential for the sustainable&#13;
harvest of only 45,000 m3 a year.&#13;
2.05         Scrub Forests and Rangelands . Local agricultural communities depend on the scrub forests and&#13;
rangelands for domestic fuel, grass and grazing for their livestock and have rights on parts of the forests for&#13;
these uses. Heavy over-grazing has depleted considerable areas of the scrub. At places the vegetation is totally&#13;
gone. Misuse and uncontrolled grazing by nomadic graziers have aggravated the situation and have made more&#13;
lands barren. The sustainable yield of wood is estimated at only 53,000 m3/year.  Most of the Pothwar Tract, a&#13;
large rural area in Punjab which contains scrub forest lands and some of the potentially most productive ranges&#13;
in Pakistan, is subject to heavy soil erosion.&#13;
2.06         Riverine Forests. These are small scattered floodplain forests, locally called belas, found on the&#13;
banks of the Indus, Chenab, Jhelum and Ravi rivers. Originally, these forests were managed to stabilize the river&#13;
banks, protect adjoining areas from floods and preserve the floodplain bio-diversity and environment. The&#13;
control of water on the upper reaches of these rivers has eroded their utility and engineered their decline. Of the&#13;
5 1,000 hectares of riverine forests administered by the Punjab Forest Department (PFD), only 53 percent, are&#13;
wooded. The rest are blank, of which only 3,000 ha are plantable. The contribution of riverine forests to flood&#13;
protection and wood production is marginal and diminishing. Constituting only 0.13 percent of the total land&#13;
1/ Based on 1980 census figures (in thousands) of 34,241 rural residents and 13,053 urban&#13;
residents and population growth rates of 2.58* for rural areas and 4.38t for urban areas.&#13;
- 2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
area, the forest is too small to be physically and ecologically effective. Also, even if fully forested, the belas&#13;
would not become a major source of wood.&#13;
B. Plantings&#13;
2.07         Timber Plantations. The Government-owned and managed timber plantations were initially set up&#13;
to supply fuelwood for the railways. Previously the management of these areas aimed at the production of high&#13;
quality commercial timber as well as fuelwood as a by-product. About 142,000 ha out of a total of 285,000 ha&#13;
of plantations have access to residual supplies of irrigation water for the initial period of the forest rotation. Out&#13;
of this area, 79,000 ha actually support a tree crop; 63,000 ha are treeless. Of the treeless area, 49,000 ha are&#13;
unplantable; the remaining 14,000 ha might be salvageable with reforestation.&#13;
2.08         Farm Trees. Punjab has about 12 million ha of farmlands, which is more than the combined&#13;
farmland area of all other provinces. Over the past decade, the trees planted on or bordering these lands have&#13;
become a prominent source of wood for the province. According to a farm forestry survey carried out by the&#13;
Forest Sector Master Plan (FSMP), on average 17.7 trees are growing per hectare of farmlands in the Punjab.&#13;
Assuming a tree density of 700/ha, the total area under farmland trees would be equivalent to some 306,000 ha&#13;
of block plantations with an estimated annual growth of 5,200,000 m3. At this scale farm production would&#13;
provide more than one-third of the total current wood requirement and five times the combined potential wood&#13;
supply from all other sources in Punjab.&#13;
Institutional Issues&#13;
A. Legislation&#13;
2.09         Numerous laws and regulations exist to govern the public and non-public forest sector, all of&#13;
which essentially emanate from a basic code promulgated over a century ago. The 1927 Forestry Act, which&#13;
replaced the Indian Forestry Act of 1878, defined permanent public forest reserves in Punjab, prescribed penalties&#13;
and framed the police role of the Forest Department. The fundamental approach of the legislation is&#13;
administrative and there is considerable debate over whether such acts have actually facilitated forest&#13;
exploitation. The legislation contributes little to the development of forestry in the private sector and does not&#13;
provide for popular participation in the formulation of policy or in the investment planning for or the&#13;
management of forests, rangelands and watersheds. According to the FSMP recommendations, the Forest Act&#13;
should eventually be repealed and replaced with legislation that reflects modern, sound environmental&#13;
management.&#13;
B. General Planning and Operations of the Puniab Forest Department&#13;
2.10         In the forest sector the Punjab Forest Department (PFD) is accountable for the technical&#13;
management of forests, the execution of development projects and the administration of rights related to the&#13;
sector. The plans for its operations in reforestation and range rehabilitation are generally set out in standardized&#13;
documents (PC-l's) which function as a control mechanism for the spending of funds, and which are extremely&#13;
inflexible in use. The measurement of success is judged solely by the fulfillment of the plan targets, regardless&#13;
of the true environmental, economic or social impacts. In practice, plans are rarely subsequently adjusted to&#13;
changing local conditions; moreover, PFD staff are reluctant to consider cost sharing arrangements or self-help&#13;
activities by villagers because these situations endanger control over work and potential departures from officially&#13;
sanctioned expenditures. The findings of the institutional review undertaken during project preparation agreed&#13;
with the FSMP in highlighting a number of institutional weaknesses in the forest sector: (i) lack of continuity&#13;
between policy formulation and implementation; (ii) dearth of useful data (on resources, use, etc.) for planning&#13;
purposes; (iii) weak capabilities in planning, monitoring and evaluation; (iv) mismanagement of human resources&#13;
due to political interference, low morale and inadequate training; (v) public-sector orientation of forest&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
department staff with limited experience or interest in community and private sector participation; (vi)&#13;
insufficient research support; and (vii) inadequate finances.&#13;
C. Natural Forest Management&#13;
2.11         Scrub Forests and Rangelands. There are many provincial and federal agencies that have range&#13;
and scrub land management interests as part of their mandates.  The complexity inherent in range and scrub&#13;
forest management is compounded by the segregation of responsibility for livestock management, animal&#13;
husbandry, veterinary medicine, etc., among a wide array of government agencies. This has resulted in partial&#13;
attempts at range and scrub forest development by many separate (and non-communicating) departments and a&#13;
confusion of recommendations and policies that are frequently at cross purposes with one another.&#13;
2.12         In Punjab a degree of specialization exists within the PFD with the presence of a Range&#13;
Management Circle that is headed by a Conservator of Forests who is trained in range management. This CF&#13;
has the responsibility of supervising and supporting the work of all staff assigned to range management tasks&#13;
within the PFD. Most of the Range Management Circle support staff members are, however, either junior or&#13;
non-professional. The training that they receive allows them to carry out instructions, but not to act as advisors&#13;
or on their own initiative. Range management science is also not considered to be a viable career path within&#13;
the PFD. Consequently, the number of PFD staff having advanced training or specialization in range&#13;
management is very limited and range science as a profession is not highly regarded.&#13;
D. Plantings&#13;
2.13         Irrigated Timber Plantations. The current yield of about 2.8 m'/ha per year is low; although,&#13;
according to FSMP estimates, the plantations can yield 3 to 4 times the current production. The major&#13;
constraints bearing on the inefficient performance of the timber plantations in the public sector are: (i) poor&#13;
management and supervision; (ii) inadequate water supplies; (iii) deteriorating irrigation systems and waste of&#13;
water; (iv) deteriorating site conditions due to waterlogging and salinity; (v) lack of skilled staff at lower levels;&#13;
(vi) poor logging, inventory and grading system; and (vii) inadequate operating funds. These constraints are as&#13;
much managerial and administrative as technical.&#13;
2.14         Farm Plantings.  Recent progress in the adoption of farm forestry has been significant and was&#13;
fueled in part by incentives given to farmers in the form of subsidized seedlings and the guaranteed procurement&#13;
of privately produced seedlings by the PFD. The progress, however, has come at the cost of economic efficiency&#13;
and equity as the government's interventions have inhibited the development of broad-based private sector&#13;
participation. A recent survey, for example, showed that two-thirds of those households who planted trees in&#13;
1990/91 planted on average fewer than four and accounted for only one-twentieth of total plantings; whereas just&#13;
over 1 percent of those who planted accounted for over half of the trees planted. This would imply these trees&#13;
were, for the most part, planted on the largest land holdings4'. The narrow base of participation introduces the&#13;
risk that wood supplies and prices could swing widely on the economic decisions made by relatively few&#13;
farmers. The possibility of this happening is not trivial as the HESS survey estimates that most of trees are now&#13;
almost certainly being planted on agricultural or marginally productive agricultural lands. Changes in&#13;
government agricultural policies that affect the profitability of cropping would undoubtedly have some bearing&#13;
on whether these past investments continue. The statistics moreover raise the question whether the government's&#13;
subsidized distribution of seedlings is fair: those who benefit more from the subsidies are those having the best&#13;
means to pay.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.15         Also, farmers undertook most of these plantings in anticipation of the development of marketing&#13;
channels to timber industries. Given the massive tree planting encouraged by government campaigns, it is&#13;
uncertain whether these local markets will be as extensive as would be required when the rotations are complete.&#13;
Credit markets in Pakistan for medium- to long-term industrial investments, particularly among wood-based&#13;
industries, are very thin. Apart from the problems of securing financing, the private sector is also likely to&#13;
contend with regulation and to face some technical difficulties related to the siting of new industries and the&#13;
logistics of collecting raw material.&#13;
Insufficient Community Participation&#13;
2.16         Symptomatic of the present approach of the PFD is the near absence of communication between&#13;
villages and the Department, especially where range management is concerned. Part of this may be attributed to&#13;
the requirement of officers to adhere to purely target-oriented work plans, which allow little scope, time or&#13;
incentive to involving villagers in forestry or range management activities.&#13;
2.17         Given the limited technical manpower available in the range management sector, the focus of&#13;
much of PFD's effort has been upon the planning, preparation and execution of range rehabilitation schemes on&#13;
public lands. There has been little or no effort focused on participatory strategies and methods. Where the PFD&#13;
does operate, the efforts undertaken to rehabilitate rangelands are not aimed at the overall management of the&#13;
areas per se, except when weakly enforced control of stocking rates are periodically imposed.&#13;
Technical Issues&#13;
2.18         Planting Stock. The quality of planting stock is consistently poor in Pakistan. This results in&#13;
lower productivity, uneven tree development, and increased weeding and maintenance costs. Most importantly,&#13;
poor quality of planting stock is causing very high rates of tree loss after planting. In farm forestry projects of&#13;
Jhelum and Attock regions of Punjab, average tree survival rates are below 40 percent. The provision of better&#13;
planting stock is one of the principal technical needs of the sector. Improving the planting stock will need to&#13;
consider two factors: better seeds selection and improved nursery operations. At present, PFD has limited&#13;
capacity to collaborate with the existing seed banks or to assist farmers in the proper selection and collection of&#13;
seeds. The calibre of nursery operations is also invariably low in both PFD and private nurseries.&#13;
2.19         Pastoral Use of Scrub Forests and Rangelands. One of the chief concerns regarding the use of&#13;
common property resources is the need to enhance the on-farm delivery of technical support to facilitate the&#13;
proper feeding, herd management and marketing of livestock and livestock products. These steps would&#13;
encourage an intensification of livestock production as a means of increasing income from the activity rather than&#13;
through an expansion of herd size and the extension of grazing.&#13;
2.20         Forestry Research. Nationally, the Pakistan Forest Institute (Peshawar) is the principal research&#13;
institution on forestry and range management. PFI has a number of research projects in the provinces and&#13;
collaborates with other research institutions such as the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC). GOP's&#13;
strategy is to retain the central role for PFI while promoting linkages with provincial research centers. Punjab is&#13;
one of the provinces (with Sindh, and AJK) that has a provincial research entity -- the Punjab Forestry Research&#13;
Institute (PFRI) located near Faisalabad in Gutwala. Established in 1982. PFRI is a relatively young institution.&#13;
2.21         A needs assessment for overall forestry research development in Punjab should be an integral part&#13;
of the general assessment of human resources development in PFD. Such a study would ensure that the available&#13;
resources for research are used efficiently. In the meantime, efforts in the areas of emphasis should be&#13;
streamlined and strengthened and a greater share of resources should be allocated to research on seed technology,&#13;
nursery practices, tree management and participatory management systems in the scrub forests and rangelands.&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Policy Issues&#13;
2.22          Seedling Subsidies. The current policy of large-scale seedling subsidization for farmers is fiscally&#13;
wasteful, inhibits the provision of quality nursery stock from the private sector and discourages the operation of a&#13;
market-oriented response by farmers to demands for short-rotation timber and fuelwood. HESS surveys indicate&#13;
that farmers have been planting trees mainly for the production of timber for sale. The production of fuelwood,&#13;
however, is a primary by-product of this activity, and so long as farmers perceive financial incentives in the&#13;
production of timber, the production of fuelwood benefits as well. The government's policy of supplying&#13;
seedlings to farmers at subsidized rates produced an unhelpful market distortion and diverted resources from&#13;
areas where the government, more than the private sector, could have usefully played a role in promoting farm&#13;
forestry.&#13;
2.23          Transport Taxes and Regulations. Although the system of wood trading and transport appears to&#13;
be competitive and efficient overall in Pakistan. the system of transit taxes encumbers the marketing of wood and&#13;
wood products. Transit taxes and other restrictions applied to hauling wood products show considerable variation&#13;
depending upon location. For traders in Punjab, overall transit taxes on average take up the same share as about&#13;
half the total en route cost, which could be considered a rather high tax burden for a non-manufactured good.&#13;
The tax structure appears to be poorly understood by transporters and is subject to widespread abuse. A well-&#13;
publicized simplification and standardization of the system of transit taxes and regulations should bolster&#13;
incentives to tree growing and efficient marketing.&#13;
National Conservation Strategy and Its Implications for Punjab&#13;
2.24          Historically, the forest resources in the areas now constituting Pakistan, may never have been&#13;
very extensive, and there are presently few scientific criteria that can define a specific magnitude of increase in&#13;
the forested area as an objective for forest management in Pakistan. Assigning a specific objective for&#13;
reforestation is not essential for the definition of a workable strategy for the protection of existing forest&#13;
resources.&#13;
2.25          The NCS prescribes a two-pronged approach for forests: protection of existing resources while&#13;
expanding the supply of wood (for timber, fuel and feed) from farmland. Within the Bank's regional&#13;
environmental and forestry strategies, Pakistan is identified as a forest-deficit country where significant&#13;
improvements are needed at the institutional level to allow for participatory protection and use of forest&#13;
resources. Other areas of emphasis include land tenure and reforestation efforts.&#13;
Bank Group Assistance Strategy&#13;
2.26          The country assistance strategy for Pakistan focuses on two closely linked development goals:&#13;
poverty reduction and the easing of constraints to sustained growth. To address the poverty reduction objective,&#13;
the Bank Group's approach stresses the improvement of inadequate basic services and weak social indicators. To&#13;
support the growth objective, Bank efforts include: structural reform --with and emphasis on public finance&#13;
issues and improving the enabling environment for the private sector; removal of constraints on agricultural&#13;
productivity; and protection of Pakistan's natural resource base. In the forest sector, application of this strategy&#13;
would require progress on the following priority issues: (i) expansion of the role of the private sector in market-&#13;
driven subsectors such as nurseries, farm forestry, and plantations; (ii) reorientation of government operations to&#13;
support this private sector role through appropriate policies, regulations, community extension, research and&#13;
training; and (iii) increasing the role of users in the management of natural resources.&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.27         The Bank Group has already supported projects in several sectors with components to improve the&#13;
environment or to rehabilitate and develop natural resources. In agriculture the Bank Group projects have&#13;
focused on correcting waterlogging and soil salinity arising from inadequate irrigation drainage and on reversing&#13;
deforestation and depasturing on watersheds and rangelands5'. The Bank has also been the executing agency for&#13;
a series of projects-' to repair environmental damage ensuing from the temporary settlement of large numbers of&#13;
Afghan refugees. In the energy sector, Bank Group projects have focused on strengthening energy production&#13;
and distribution institutions; rationalizing local energy prices and the price structure for different consumers, with&#13;
regard to international energy prices; introducing energy conservation technology; introducing emission standards&#13;
for the release of pollutants into Pakistan's air and water; and requiring environmental impact assessment (EIA)&#13;
procedures to be undertaken before investing in energy producing activities. The Second Energy Loan (Ln.&#13;
3107-PAK) is the main project with environmental protection components.&#13;
2.28         The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the Bank, and other bilateral and&#13;
multilateral agencies are assisting GOP and the provinces to implement an environmental action plan based for&#13;
Pakistan based on the country's National Conservation Strategy (NCS). Associated with this assistance, the Bank&#13;
is supporting the Environmental Protection and Resource Conservation Project (Cr. 2383-PAK), and the&#13;
Balochistan Natural Resource Management Project (Cr. 2548-PAK) which are initiating actions, at the federal&#13;
level and in Punjab, Sindh, NWFP, AJK and Balochistan: to develop institutions responsible for the environment&#13;
and natural resource management, to formulate policies and legislation, to undertake field operations; to address&#13;
specific problems of land degradation; and, to conduct public education of the environment.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Group Involvement&#13;
2.29         The present project will form part of the implementation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-&#13;
supported Forest Sector Master Plan (FSMP) of Pakistan and NCS, the aims of which are broadly endorsed by&#13;
IDA. The project would also be compatible with the Bank Group's emerging strategy of comprehensive resource&#13;
management in Pakistan with its emphasis on site rehabilitation, institutional strengthening, education, training&#13;
and community participation. The project should, moreover, contribute to the alleviation of rural poverty. The&#13;
involvement of IDA will contribute significantly to the solving of problems of policy formulation and&#13;
implementation and in facilitating the coordination of a number of donors operating in the sector. In particular,&#13;
IDA's close coordination with the Asian Development Bank on the approach to the sector will foster the first&#13;
instance of a comprehensive donor strategy for forest sector development in Pakistan.&#13;
2.30         This strategy for forest sector development is consistent with the overall country strategy for&#13;
natural resources conservation and with Pakistan's National Conservation Strategy. It aims at increasing and&#13;
maintaining the sustainable productivity of forest resources through: (i) expanding the role of the private sector&#13;
in agroforestry, seedling production and forest resources use; (ii) reorienting government operations to support&#13;
this private sector role through appropriate regulation, community extension, research and training; and (iii)&#13;
increasing the role of users in the management of natural resources.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
Proiect Obiective and Scope&#13;
3.01         The objective of the project is to improve the performance of the forestry sector in Punjab,&#13;
entailing the natural, financial and human resources operating in the sector. The impact of this improvement will&#13;
be an abatement in the deterioration in quantity and quality of the forest sector's sustainable contribution to the&#13;
welfare of rural and urban households in Punjab. Harvests of wood and other products for energy or for other&#13;
direct consumption by households, or for the development of wood-based industries that generate employment&#13;
and value added will be one form of contribution. Another may also take the form of a consumer surplus&#13;
realized in providing marketed wood energy less expensively. Other contributions will be environmental,&#13;
affecting incomes, for example, by reducing potential losses in agricultural productivity owing to the external&#13;
effects of certain land uses; influencing health; providing amenities; yielding recreational value; or providing&#13;
other intangible natural conservation benefits.&#13;
3.02         Characterizing the scope of operations, the main concerns of the project's intervention in the&#13;
sector are to:&#13;
(a)   improve the incentive framework governing the use of resources;&#13;
(b)   improve silvicultural productivity; and&#13;
(c)   improve development planning and the setting of resource management priorities.&#13;
Improving the incentive framework will encompass the decision making regarding investments in and use of&#13;
private, common and public property resources. Improving silvicultural productivity would include improving&#13;
planting materials, husbandry practices and the conduct of research. Improving development planning and the&#13;
setting of priorities will chiefly concern the collection and use of information on resources, and the provision of&#13;
environmental services.&#13;
3.03         The chief outcomes or goals of the project will include:&#13;
(a)    conditions that would encourage a broadening of the productive base of wood (for use as&#13;
an industrial raw material and as a fuel) supplied from farm land in terms of both numbers&#13;
of farms participating and quantities of wood produced per farm;&#13;
(b)    demonstrations of scrub forests rangeland and plantations rehabilitation and management&#13;
that maintain the availability of common benefits and forestall the deterioration of&#13;
resources through open access and the exploitative behavior of local populations and the&#13;
private sector; and&#13;
(c)   strengthened local public and community institutions managing the sector in Punjab.&#13;

(d)    implementing a pilot management and rehabilitation plan for three representative&#13;
plantations of Punjab's agroecological zones.&#13;
Detailed Features&#13;
Sector Activities&#13;
3.05          Human Resources Development. One of the main priorities for overall sector development is the&#13;
initiation of a comprehensive program of human resources development. This program would aim to foster&#13;
public/private interactions in the sector and to improve the efficiency of public sector services that facilitate&#13;
overall forest sector development without crowding out private sector roles. The first step in this direction will&#13;
be an in-depth study of human resources in the sector. GOPunjab has already agreed to the objectives of the&#13;
study and will implement the study as a priority task among the start-up activities of the project's launch.&#13;
Results of this study will be available by the end of first year of project implementation and will guide overall&#13;
institutional reform including, in particular: (i) implementation mechanisms for forest sector activities; (ii) the&#13;
strengthening and streamlining of PFD research; and (iii) the promotion of public/private interaction in fostering&#13;
demand for farm forestry products. Following up the HRD study, the project will provide funds to finance the&#13;
preparation of future projects in the sector based on the study's results and recommendations.&#13;
3.06          Research. The project will strengthen PFRI's human resources and facilities in areas directly&#13;
concerning this project, but primarily in the area of farm forestry, which is discussed further below. GOPunjab&#13;
will allocate funds to meet the specific research objectives of the project including the areas of planting stock&#13;
improvement, agroforestry technology and participatory rangeland rehabilitation. The development of this&#13;
research support program will take into account the research activities of PFI and other research institutes.&#13;
Another area of research will consider the environmental aspects of the public sector timber plantations and is&#13;
covered under the pilot component on plantations.&#13;
Farm Forestry&#13;
3.07          Objectives. The first objective of the farm forestry component is to encourage the farming&#13;
community to provide its own seedlings on a sustainable basis by the fifth year of the project. The PFD will&#13;
accordingly phase out its own farm forestry seedling production over the same period. Ideally, at the end of the&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
project farmers will have completely assumed all production aspects of farm forestry. The PFD would provide&#13;
seed, technical assistance, research and training to help ensure sustainability. In the past PFD's main objective&#13;
was to increase the numbers of trees planted by farmers using, for the most part, seedlings produced by the PFD.&#13;
The numbers planted were impressive, but survival percentages and tree quality were poor. The second objective&#13;
under this component is therefore for the PFD to increase its efforts to help the farmer improve the quality of&#13;
trees grown. The third objective is to help the farmer find profitable markets for the final products. These last&#13;
two steps will assist the farmer to maximize the net returns on his/her investment. The project will give high&#13;
priority to treating unproductive degraded/marginal lands and to encouraging a shift in emphasis towards&#13;
production by smaliholders.&#13;
3.08          Activities. Project activities will fall under three major headings: tree establishment, tree&#13;
management and marketing. The PFD, while maintaining a comparative advantage in research and extension on&#13;
tree establishment, will substantially increase its provision of technical assistance to farmers in tree management&#13;
and marketing.&#13;
3.09          Tree Establishment will involve introducing: (a) improved seed quality and quantity; (b) a wider&#13;
choice in species and varieties; (c) better seedlings through improved nursery practice; (d) better planting&#13;
techniques and spacing; (e) fertilizer application in the nurseries and at the time of planting; (f) development of&#13;
improved agroforestry practices; and (g) improved weeding and beating-up practices. Aiming to improve&#13;
seedling quality, species choice and establishment percentages, these tasks will require the coordinated efforts of&#13;
the Farm Forestry Wing (FFW) and PFRI.&#13;
3.10          Tree Management will undertake the introduction of: (a) appropriate watering practices; (b)&#13;
improved pruning schedules; (c) improved thinning schedules; and (d) determining optimum rotation ages. The&#13;
objective is to improve cultural practices to enhance significantly tree volume, quality and marketability. FFW,&#13;
PFRI and the PFD forest training schools will undertake these initiatives.&#13;
3.11          Marketing Intelligence will comprise: (a) introducing a log grading system based on measurements&#13;
that can be made by the farmer; (b) improving harvesting (felling, bucking, logging) practices; (c) improving&#13;
linkages between the producer (farmer) and the user (industry); (d) creating a data base; and (e) developing a&#13;
marketing strategy. The project will finance the purchase of private sector expertise and marketing services to&#13;
undertake these tasks with assistance from the PFD. Project financing will also support the contracting of private&#13;
sector services to provide periodic assessments of current marketing prospects and trends for various raw&#13;
materials and to produce information on wood purchase contracts and prices for regular dissemination by radio or&#13;
through other suitable mass media.&#13;
3.12          Phasing Out of PFD Nurseries. There are some 700 PFD nurseries currently providing farm&#13;
forestry seedlings requirements. These will be phased out by year 5 and replaced by over 1,000 farmer nurseries,&#13;
which are expected to be established by the same year. The project anticipates the following phasing of&#13;
nurseries:&#13;
Table 3.1 Phasing Out of PFD Nurseries&#13;

Year     0          1          2          3         4          5          6&#13;
PFD             700       560        280        210        140        0          0&#13;

Numbers for the PFD are firm but only indicative for the private farmer nurseries (FF), assuming an average of&#13;
three per Markaz.&#13;
- 11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.13          Targeting of Extension Activities. Although generally all farmers will have access to the&#13;
informational services of the project, extension activities will be organized primarily around groups of farmers&#13;
who hold each arable holdings of land of five hectares or less to broaden the production base of farm forestry.&#13;
These farmers, who form the largest percentage of cultivators, are greatly under-represented among participants&#13;
of previous farm forestry campaigns. As a group, these farmers constitute much of the rural poor in Punjab.&#13;
Moreover, the delivery of seedling subsidies will be directed towards those farming communities where average&#13;
household income are below the median income for the province, where farm tree planting is an unfamiliar&#13;
practice and where wood would be produced primarily for home consumption as fuel.&#13;
3.14          Implementation Arrangements. The delivery system will pattern the provincial civil administrative&#13;
structure, rather than the PFD's, to provide better coordination with other line departments, facilitate monitoring&#13;
and ensure even extension coverage throughout Punjab. One extension forester (Forester or Forest Guard) will&#13;
be posted to each of the 354 Markazs (there are on average 66 villages per Markaz). One Forest Ranger will&#13;
supervise the Extension Foresters in two Tehsils and there will be an SDFO to supervise Forest Rangers in each&#13;
of the 34 Districts. A DFO will be posted to each Divisional HQ. Three Conservators of Forests (CF) one each&#13;
at Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan will provide the overall supervision required to implement this component.&#13;
Heading the Farm Forestry Wing and Scrub/Rangeland conservancy will be the CCF(PD) stationed in Lahore.&#13;
Professional staff requirements will be as follows:&#13;

The project will finance these incremental staff: 58 professional, 70 technical staff, including drivers, and 162&#13;
support staff.  PFD will provide the remaining technical staff requirements through transfers. By the end of the&#13;
project, the PFD will absorb all technical staff below the level of CF, except for 34 Forest Rangers who will&#13;
remain at the Tehsil level to ensure continued farmer access to technical assistance. The CCF(PD) and two CF&#13;
posts will then discontinue, leaving one CF at the center.&#13;
3.15          Delivery Mechanisms for Seedling Subsidies. In its tree-planting campaigns PFD has provided&#13;
seedlings to farmers virtually free of cost. Under this project, the subsidy will be phased out over four years:&#13;
75% in year 1, 60% in year 2, 40% in year 3, 25% in year 4 and 0 in years 5 and 6. Under the current system,&#13;
when the farmer collects his/her seedlings from the private nurseryman, payment of the non subsidy element is&#13;
made (e.g., in year I of the project this would be 25% of Rs 1.75 or about Rs 0.44 per seedling). The&#13;
nurseryman is not paid the balance or subsidy element (in this case Rs. 1.31 per seedling) until the number of&#13;
seedlings actually planted by all the farmers obtaining seedlings from his/her nursery has been verified in the&#13;
field by a forest officer. Delays in the final payment (crossed check) to the nurseryman, by the DFO or his&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
designate, sometimes run into months. It is the nurseryman who is penalized if the seedlings are not planted, not&#13;
the fanner. The present project will intervene to simplify the process. One approach would be for a forest&#13;
officer to make payment (of the subsidy element) once he has verified that the nursery contains the contracted&#13;
number of quality seedlings of the correct species. As before, the farmer would pay the non-subsidy element on&#13;
collection of the seedlings. This would ensure prompt payment to the nurseryman and a reduction in the number&#13;
of PFD staff involved in the process. The project will use sampling techniques to determine the number of&#13;
seedlings planted. IDA and GOPunjab agreed that IDA funds would not be used for seedling subsidies. PFD&#13;
informed IDA that these subsidies will be covered by the Punjab Finance Department until the total elimination&#13;
of the subsidies (year 4 of the project).&#13;
3.16          Training. Critical to the success of the farm forestry component will be the training of territorial&#13;
forest guards, foresters, forest rangers and SDFO/DFO's in extension methods. PFD will undertake a crash&#13;
program before credit effectiveness using retroactive financing to train 200 foresters/FG's for two weeks, 40&#13;
SDFO/forest rangers for one week and 13 DFO/CF's for one week. The project will also finance under&#13;
retroactive financing before the project's launch training some 50 farmers in nursery and tree management&#13;
practices. PFD will run local training and refresher courses thereafter at both Forest Training Schools (Gora Gali&#13;
and Bahawalapur) and at PFRI for all technical staff and selected farmers. Some 1,350 staff and farmers will&#13;
have received in-service training by the time of the project's completion. The project will finance overseas study&#13;
tours (II senior officers for three weeks each) and short courses (12 weeks to a year for 37 DFO/SDFOs and&#13;
scientists from PFRI). These tours/study courses, to be conducted in countries with similar conditions will center&#13;
on farm forestry needs. Participants will be expected to produce comprehensive reports reviewing lessons&#13;
learned and their relevance to Punjab. The project will provide three PhD fellowships for PFRI staff covering&#13;
tissue culture, forest genetics and silvicultural practices on farmland.&#13;
3.17          Farm Forestry Research.  The two top priority areas for farm forestry research are the&#13;
improvement in seed quality/quantity (collection, processing, storage, etc.) and the improvement of nursery&#13;
practices. In addition, species/variety trials, improvement in cultural practices and dissemination of research&#13;
findings and farmer production should increase dramatically. The project will strengthen PFRI by financing&#13;
equipment, buildings, incremental staff (two Additional Directors, three Senior Research Officers, four Research&#13;
Officers, one Superintendent, one staff nurse and 56 support and technical staff) vehicles and technical assistance.&#13;
PFRI's Program Committee, which usually meets once a year to guide research priorities, will be reconstituted to&#13;
include a farmer representative from each territorial zone.&#13;
3.18          Technical Assistance in Farm Forestry. The project will finance consultancies covering the&#13;
following areas of farm forestry training and technology transfer: nursery techniques, extension and marketing.&#13;
Each consultant will be engaged for 6 months in the first year and a month each in years 2 and 3. In farm&#13;
forestry research, the project will finance a total of 24 staff months of technical assistance for improving seed&#13;
quality and quantity and for improving nursery practices. (See Technical Assistance Summary, Annex 3 Table&#13;
13; and Terms of Reference, Annex 4).&#13;
3.19          Taxes and Permits. Current tree cutting permits and transit taxes discourage planting by farmers.&#13;
PFD will abolish these permnits and transit taxes for all farm forestry trees except for Acacia modesta in all areas&#13;
and for trees within an 8-km belt along national boundaries. PFD agreed to contact local authorities to repeal the&#13;
octroi charges on farm forestry products, which penalize marketing between districts.&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Social Range and Scrub Forest Management&#13;
3.20         Working with communities lying adjacent to reserve range and scrub forest areas in selected tracts&#13;
of Pothwar and Thal, the project will initiate a pilot program of range management that aims to involve&#13;
stakeholders in the protection, management and utilization of resources. The project will support the&#13;
rehabilitation of degraded communal land and the promotion of fodder crops on private land. During project&#13;
implementation PFD and IDA will assess the feasibility of applying lessons learned from this component to&#13;
range/scrub areas outside of Pothwar and Thal.&#13;
3.21        The establishment of participatory management over selected scrub forests and range lands will&#13;
involve the following three processes:&#13;
(a)   the formation of Community Organizations (COs):&#13;
(b)   the preparation of microplans defining improved land use and management through participatory&#13;
planning; and&#13;
(c)   the sanctioning and implementing of formal agreements between communities and the Forest&#13;
Department.&#13;
3.22         Formation of Community Organizations. Following the selection of priority reserves and a&#13;
preliminary screening of villages, the project will invite communities where a majority of members wish to&#13;
participate to form COs. The COs will have a formal constitution and membership will be open to all members&#13;
of the community, both men and women. In some instances existing village organizations, for example, those set&#13;
up through the activities of NGOs, could form the basis for a CO.&#13;
3.23         Participatory Micro-Planning. The implementation of the component will use participatory&#13;
methods to define the resource use and priority needs of enlisted communities, concentrating particularly on those&#13;
uses and needs that impact range and scrub forest resources on public and communal land. The COs, working&#13;
with project personnel, will define alternative strategies for the use of these resources within the constraints of&#13;
technical options and their needs and priorities. The strategy would likely include pasture improvement,&#13;
afforestation with multipurpose trees, rehabilitation of degraded land, and the planting of fodder trees and crops&#13;
on private land (see physical treatments below). The micro-plan would also lay down grazing plans and&#13;
regulation for the protection and management of improved rangeland and scrub forest.&#13;
3.24         Joint Management Agreements. The micro-planning process will lead to a formal agreement&#13;
between the COs and the Forest Department defining the terms of participation in joint management of the&#13;
range/scrub forest area. The agreement will link the community to the management of a defined area of the&#13;
public reserve, specifying management treatments, protection measures, arrangements for sharing products,&#13;
sanctions, and conflict resolution procedures. The DFO will approve joint management agreements.&#13;
Physical Treatments&#13;
3.25         The technical options on offer during the participatory planning process will depend upon local&#13;
conditions and priorities. The following is a listing of a number of anticipated interventions with estimates of&#13;
the scale of their application.&#13;
3.26         Pasture Establishment on Public and Communal Lands. The project would establish improved&#13;
pasture on public land (Reserve Forest) in Pothwar and Thal and, where available, on community (shamlat) land&#13;
in Pothwar. The establishment would involve selective uprooting of undesirable plants, land levelling, plowing,&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and seeding, followed by protection for one year. About 5,100 ha in Pothwar and 8,000 ha in Thal would&#13;
receive this treatment together with approximately 500 ha of private lands.&#13;
3.27         Afforestation in Scrub Forests. The project will plant multipurpose tree and shrub seedlings,&#13;
raised in local nurseries, on public land in the scrub forest areas of both Thal and Pothwar (where available,&#13;
communal land in Pothwar would also be treated). Tree establishment would follow land preparation. and, in&#13;
Pothwar be accompanied by soil and water conservation measures. The establishment phase in Thal would likely&#13;
require watering. Lands undergoing this treatment may in total amount to about 5,100 ha in Pothwar and 3,200&#13;
ha in Thal.&#13;
3.28         Improved Range and Pasture Management. The project will introduce rotational and deferred&#13;
grazing systems on both improved pastures and untreated public lands in consultation with COs under the&#13;
technical guidance of the FD. The COs will subsequently regulate the use of these areas, which are expected to&#13;
total as much as 10,200 ha in Pothwar and 8,000 ha in Thal.&#13;
3.29         Development of Water Points. Where the groundwater is deep in Pothwar the project will assist&#13;
in the construction of mini-dams to create ponds on public land for the watering of livestock. In Thal, the&#13;
project will help install hand pumps at selected sites. In total, the project proposes the placement of 30 water&#13;
points in Pothwar and 20 handpumps in Thal.&#13;
3.30         Fodder on Private Land. To reduce livestock pressure on public land and to supplement fodder&#13;
during the winter deficit period, the project will encourage farmers to cultivate fodder crops on private land. As&#13;
part of this effort the project will provide seed of improved varieties of fodder crops (oats. vetches, sorghum and&#13;
maize) to introduce production on 400-500 ha. The project will also promote the cultivation of fodder trees&#13;
through the farm forestry component of the project.&#13;
3.31         The project will target in total the forming of 100 COs over the project life, 68 in Pothwar and 32&#13;
in Thal. The following table summarizes the expected average areas to be treated per community in Pothwar and&#13;
Thal.&#13;

In total. the 100 COs would participate in the improvement and joint management of about 39,600 ha of public&#13;
and communal range land and scrub forests.&#13;
3.32         Table 3.4 presents the expected phasing of CO formation under the project. These initial targets&#13;
are relatively modest to allow for close monitoring of progress.&#13;

Selection Criteria and Planning Methods&#13;
3.33         The project will finance an Initiation and Site Selection Study at the start of the project to identify&#13;
and select reserves for the introduction of participatory management. The study will assess current land use and&#13;
potential, as well as the expressed needs of adjoining communities and their willingness to participate in the&#13;
project (see Terms of Reference, Annex 4). Criteria for site selection will be both physical and socio-economic,&#13;
and will include the willingness of surrounding villages to participate.&#13;
3.34         In implementing participatory management, the project will adopt a cluster approach, through&#13;
which groups of villages around the same reserve would develop joint management plans in concert. The&#13;
objective of this strategy would be to handle management units in an integral and coordinated fashion, and to&#13;
consider concurrently the interests of neighboring villages. This would represent a departure from current PFD&#13;
practice, whereby planning is executed on a compartment by compartment basis without reference to neighboring&#13;
communities.&#13;
Terms of Participation&#13;
3.35         The project will finance the direct costs of range and scrub forest improvement. Through the&#13;
participatory planning process, COs will be jointly involved in decision making regarding which physical&#13;
treatments and proposed grazing systems to adopt. Joint management agreements will define COs responsibilities&#13;
for the protection of improved and rehabilitated areas and for the enforcement of agreed grazing systems.&#13;
3.36         CO members will also be entitled to free fuelwood during thinning of afforested areas and to a&#13;
share of the final yield. Grazing access and grass cutting will be available to community members on payment&#13;
of the regular per animal grazing fee. In addition, the COs will receive for a time a watch and ward fee,&#13;
equivalent to the wages of one guard per 150 hectares of treated land (approximately one guard per CO).&#13;
3.37         Cost recovery. Early in the implementation, the project will develop and test mechanisms to&#13;
mobilize funds from within the community for continuing investment in range land and scrub forest&#13;
improvement. This might take the form of a fund under the control of the CO into which members would make&#13;
contributions. The initiation and site selection study will examine candidate mechanisms for cost recovery taking&#13;
into account existing rights of access to reserves.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.38         Existing PFD staff from the Range Management and Rawalpindi Circles, under their respective&#13;
Conservators of Forests, will implement the component; however, over the course of the implementation the&#13;
project will provide financing on a declining basis for one draftsman and 18 technical and support staff to aid the&#13;
expansion of the work program in the two target areas. The professional staff implementing this component will&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
report to the Chief Conservator of Forests (Project Director), Lahore. By the end of the project professional staff&#13;
will return to their regular postings and contracts for other support and technical staff would be completed.&#13;
3.39         Two specially trained spearhead teams will assist and train PFD field staff in the processes of&#13;
forming Community Organizations, participatory planning, and formulating joint agreements. Each spearhead&#13;
team will consist of three Forest Department staff (a DFO, an SDFO, and a Forest Ranger) and two resource&#13;
persons. The project will recruit resource persons with skills in participatory appraisal and planning techniques&#13;
from universities, research institutes, and NGOs specializing in training in participatory work. Of the two&#13;
resource persons on each team, one will be a specialist in institution building and community development, and&#13;
the other in livestock and rangeland management. Spearhead teams will in all cases work alongside local FD&#13;
field staff, who will take responsibility for continuing SRSFM work in communities.&#13;
Training and Reorientation&#13;
3.40         Success in participatory management will depend upon a reorientation of PFD staff towards&#13;
providing a client-centered, flexible and responsive service. This will require training in participatory planning,&#13;
institutional building, and technical and training skills. The project will provide training for the two spearhead&#13;
teams, FD field staff, and farmers. The training program will draw upon the staff and facilities of the Punjab&#13;
Forest Research Institute, the Department of Rural Sociology of the University of Agriculture at Faisalabad, and&#13;
NGOs experienced in training in participation such as the South Asia Partnership and the Association for the&#13;
Development of Human Resources. Provision is also made for workshops, study tours and overseas training.&#13;
Studies and Research&#13;
3.41         The project will undertake a site selection study in the first year of the project. This would&#13;
identify priority reserves according to their ecology, biological potential, current patterns of land use, and&#13;
potential for involving adjoining communities in improved range management (see Terms of Reference, Annex&#13;
4).&#13;
3.42         An external evaluation of the component, assessing the progress and impact of the participatory&#13;
approach to land management, will take place in year 3 as part of the project's mid-term review. This study will&#13;
examine the extent to which SRSFM activities have been successful in meeting their objectives, especially with&#13;
respect to attempts to build effective and sustainable institutions; and make recommendations as to the&#13;
continuation of the component (see Terms of Reference, Annex 4).&#13;
3.43         Research themes will include:&#13;
- Introduction trials of grasses, shrubs, and trees;&#13;
- Establishment of exclosures for ecological studies;&#13;
- Range conditions and trend;&#13;
- Rotational and deferred grazing systems; and&#13;
- Economic analysis.&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements&#13;
3.44         Monitoring and evaluation will be particularly critical to this component given its innovatory&#13;
nature, and the importance of adopting a learning stance towards participating communities. Feedback from&#13;
participants will be essential in ensuring that strategies can be adjusted in a timely manner so as to meet agreed&#13;
objectives. In addition to conventional financial and physical monitoring criteria, the project will develop social,&#13;
institutional and attitudinal indicators with support from technical assistance. These will nevertheless be as&#13;
simple and standardized as possible, and designed to meet management needs. Suggested indicators are included&#13;
in Annex 3. The PFD Monitoring Unit will compile collected data. The project will actively involve COs in&#13;
moniitorinig through the selection of verifiable indicators of physical. social and economic impact and the&#13;
collection of data. As noted above, an external evaluation of the SRSFM component will occur in year 3.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
3.45         The project will provide 12 staff months of internationally recruited TA for human ecology in&#13;
range management (to help address issues defining the role of local participation and pastoral institutions), 6&#13;
moniths of internationally recruited TA for research on traditional and adapted grazing systems, and 18 staff&#13;
monithis of local consultancy training in participatory resource planning. Locally recruited resource persons will&#13;
support spearhead teams in participatory planning activities (See Technical Assistance Summary, Annex 3 Table&#13;
13; and Terms of Reference, Annex 4).&#13;
Irrigated Timber Plantations&#13;
3.46         The project will undertake a pilot operation to assess the land use of public sector timber&#13;
plantations and to explore alternative institutional arrangements, particularly those incorporating local community&#13;
or private sector participation, that would better support sustainable, socially profitable uses of the environmental&#13;
and biological resources enclosed in their areas. The operation will focus on three representative plantations,&#13;
whose selection the Bank and PFD will jointly agree upon following a general diagnostic study of all plantation&#13;
sites using the implementation arrangements presented in Annex 3 and technical assistance detailed in Annex 4.&#13;
3.47         Environmental Surveys. The project will undertake surveys of the topography, soils, fauna and&#13;
flora of public sector timber plantations. The objectives of these studies are to provide a) baseline measurements&#13;
of environmental/ecological conditions and constraints that delimit land management options; b) data to guide the&#13;
designi and analysis of contingent valuation studies of the plantation areas' principally non-timber forest products&#13;
among local stakeholder communities or groups in or around the sites; and c) parameters for an analysis of land&#13;
use involving some form of bio-economic optimization. Selected detailed studies will also include hydrological&#13;
surveys as necessary for drawing up detailed engineering options to re-design or rehabilitate existing irrigation&#13;
systems and structures as part of the exercise to formulate new management plans for the plantation areas.&#13;
3.48         Contingent Valuation Studies. The project will identify and count the principal local stakeholder&#13;
;,roups within and around the selected plantations, and describe their main socio-economic characteristics.&#13;
Separately, the project will undertake analyses of stakeholder use of plantation resources and of the values that&#13;
stakeholder groups impute to those resources with the use of contingent valuation surveys. These studies would&#13;
result in specific recommendations for increased community and private sector participation in the sustainable&#13;
maniagement of the plantations.&#13;
3.49         Management Plans. Given data from the environmental and contingent valuation studies and&#13;
engineering estimates, the project will select three representative plantation and specify, from estimated and&#13;
known biological relationships, a tentative zoning of the three pilot plantations into areas for xeric forest, tropical&#13;
thorn, timber production and other uses. The objective of the zoning exercise will be to optimize land use within&#13;
the plantations according to the comparative advantages of areas; the cost of incremental investments, operation&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and maintenance; and the nature of participatory, institutional arrangements with local communities.  Within the&#13;
non-timber production zones -- so called "low intensity production areas" -- the plan will outline improvements&#13;
to the production of non-timber products and suggested extraction rates. For the high intensity timber production&#13;
areas, the plan will entail an exercise to optimize harvest scheduling.&#13;
3.50          Improvement of Water Management. The project will undertake engineering trials of improved&#13;
water management options for the selected plantations to gauge their technical and economic efficiency. These&#13;
trials will include the range of requirements of various land uses and management objectives for different&#13;
compartments in each plantation. The project will produce detailed plans for the improvement or rehabilitation&#13;
of the irrigation systems at the three selected sites. These plans will be subject to IDA approval before they are&#13;
implemented by PFD.&#13;
3.51          Improvements in the Legal Framework and Institutional Arrangements. The project will&#13;
commission an independent study to propose specific changes in the legal framework currently applying to the&#13;
plantations to promote their environmental role and allow for their multipurpose management. The study will&#13;
consider the requirements for permitting a broad range of private/public sector institutional arrangements aiming&#13;
for the financially autonomous management of plantations and an increased role for the private sector. The&#13;
project will define amendments in the existing laws and propose new legislation on the basis of the study's&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
Proiect Costs and Financin2&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
3.52          Table 3.6 presents the summary cost estimates for the various project components. Project costs&#13;
are expressed at projected April 1995 value and include duties and taxes. For the most part, the base cost&#13;
estimates reflect the expenditures of comparable provincial government agency operations, including&#13;
reforestation, soil erosion control, forestry extension, staff training, construction contracts and vehicle and&#13;
equipment purchases. Consultant service costs are based on recent contracts for similar services in Pakistan.&#13;
The cost estimates include allowances for physical contingencies of 15 percent for civil works and 10 percent for&#13;
machinery, equipment, materials, training and technical assistance, where applicable. The cost estimates also&#13;
include allowances for price escalations during the implementation period based on IDA estimates for domestic&#13;
and foreign rates of inflation. The following are the fiscal year inflation rates on which the cost estimates were&#13;
based:&#13;
Table 3.5 Inflation Rates Used in the Project Costing&#13;

2000/01            6.0                2.4&#13;
The exchange rates used in the costings are constant purchasing power parity rates. The exchange rate at the&#13;
time of the appraisal (June/July 1994) was approximately Rs 30/US$. Adjusting for projected inflation, the cost&#13;
estimates employ an exchange rate of Rs 32.0/US$ up to the start of the project.&#13;

IDA/Bank Group financing will amount to approximately US$24.87 million. The Government's share of total&#13;
project costs tally to about US$8.88 million, including the financing of taxes. Of total project costs excluding&#13;
taxes and duties (US$29.80 million), IDA/Bank Group financing would cover 84 percent. Excluding taxes and&#13;
duties, the Government would finance approximately US$4.93 million equivalent. An IDA Credit of US$24.87&#13;
million would be made to GOP which would pass it on to GOPunjab in accordance with its standard budgetary&#13;
procedures.&#13;
3.54            GOPunjab will provide their share of project finances to the implementing agencies out of annual&#13;
budget appropriations. Funds for provincial expenditures would flow from the Federal Ministry of Finance&#13;
directly to the province as development funds. GOPunjab will provide its share of project finances to the&#13;
implementing agency PFD out of annual budget appropriations. Full amproval by the Executive Committee of&#13;
the National Economic Council (ECNEC) of the proiect's Planning Commission Form No.1 (PC-I) and&#13;
sanctioning of proiect expenditures would be a condition of project effectiveness.&#13;

and services. Retroactive financing up to US$3 11,000 for procurement of essential goods and services under all&#13;
categories of expenditure was requested by the Government of Pakistan to allow early start-up of project&#13;
activities and maintain the momentum achieved during project preparation. All retroactive financing is expected&#13;
to be for eligible expenditures incurred between January 1, 1995 and the date of Credit agreement signing.&#13;

3.56           Civil Works: Civil works estimated to cost US$4.70 million include afforestation (US$0.99&#13;
million), field works (US$2.89 million) and other works consisting of the construction of offices, staff housing,&#13;
garages, sheds, seed stores and fencing (US$0.82 million). These works, which are small in size and scattered&#13;
over various locations, are not expected to attract any foreign contractors. To maximize contract size, however,&#13;
these works will be packaged into groups valued at least equal to US$40,000 equivalent and undertaken&#13;
following local competitive bidding procedures (LCB) satisfactory and acceptable to IDA. PFD will invite bids&#13;
from CWD registered contractors of the appropriate categories for undertaking these works. GOPunjab's&#13;
procurement procedures have been reviewed during appraisal and found to be consistent with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines. It has been agreed that PFD will use LCB bidding documents developed under the 1992 Flood&#13;
Damages Rehabilitation Project for procurement of civil works (for contracts up to Rs. 15 million/ US$456,000&#13;
equivalent). Afforestation expenditures will occur under the scrub forest/range component and include nursery&#13;
expenditures, land preparation and planting out costs. These works will be undertaken at a number of sites and&#13;
would generally require close supervision of the staff of PFD. Field works include soil conservation works&#13;
(such as gully plugging, check dams, contour ripping, levelling and vegetative hedges), canal rehabilitation,&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
pasture establishment, adaptive research trials and demonstration plots. Similar to the afforestation works under&#13;
the same component, these works would be small and scattered, undertaken at many sites, and would generally&#13;
require the close supervision of forestry staff of PFD. As for afforestation, a combination of LCB procurement&#13;
and force account will be used for field works. At appraisal it was agreed that, wherever possible, civil works&#13;
will be executed through local contractors using suitably packaged LCB contracts. Where private contractors are&#13;
not available, the work will be executed by force account.&#13;
3.57         Vehicles and Equipment - (US$6.43 million). Vehicles, motorcycles, heavy machinery and&#13;
laboratory equipment estimated to cost the equivalent of US$5.86 million will be procured following&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in suitable packages by grouping similar items together. A&#13;
preference limited to 15 percent of the CIF bid price or the actual customs duty applicable to non-exempt&#13;
importers, whichever is lower, will be extended to qualified local manufacturers in the evaluation of ICB bids.&#13;
GOPunjab has formally , following loan signature, no further government/inter-ministerial clearances will be&#13;
required to initiate ICB procurement of vehicles and other equipment financed under the project. Computers&#13;
with peripherals and software worth US$0.31 million will be procured following LCB procedures as most&#13;
foreign suppliers of this equipment are represented in the country. Items or groups of items relating to office&#13;
furniture, tools and equipment including seed collection, testing and laboratory implements (other than motorized&#13;
transport, bulldozers, tractors with implements and some laboratory equipment) required at different places and in&#13;
small quantities and costing less than the equivalent of US$50,000 will be procured through international or local&#13;
prudent shopping by obtaining at least three quotations from reputed suppliers, subject to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$200,000.&#13;
3.58         Technical Assistance, Training. Mass Awareness, Studies and Marketing Services - (US$11.51&#13;
million). Technical Assistance (US$2.44 million) consisting of Institutional Development (US$1.79) and Project&#13;
Preparation, Evaluation and Supervision (US$0.65) and Marketing Services and Studies (US$3.30) will be&#13;
contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines - Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency. Studies include soil mapping and local support for the range/scrub forest&#13;
initiation and site selection study and will be subject to IDA approval. Foreign and local Training (US$5.77&#13;
million), including US$3.40 million for mass awareness expenditures, comprising art work, videos, films, service&#13;
awards and other publicity materials as part of the publicity and extension activities, will be procured following&#13;
normal GOPunjab administrative practices that are acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.59         All civil works and goods contracts in excess of US$200,000, and all consulting contracts in&#13;
excess of US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals will be subject to IDA's prior review. However,&#13;
with respect to all consulting contracts, irrespective of value, prior review will continue to be required for: (a)&#13;
terms of reference; (b) single source contracts regardless of value; (c) all consultant contracts and assignments of&#13;
a critical nature (because of environmental safety or public health considerations); and (d) contract amendments&#13;
valued at about US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 for individuals, or those that raise the total&#13;
contract value to about US$100,000 equivalent. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Works, Goods and&#13;
Consulting Services will be used. Bank staff will selectively post-review about 10 percent of the awarded&#13;
contracts (including bid evaluations) which are below the threshold levels.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
3.60         The Credit will be disbursed over six years, with the Credit closing June 30, 2001. The proceeds&#13;
of the Credit will be disbursed against:&#13;
(a)    90% of expenditures on afforestation and field works and 80% of expenditures of other&#13;
civil works;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures, 100% for ex-factorv, and 80% for locally procured&#13;
equipment;&#13;
(c)    100% of expenditures on consultant services, training and studies; and&#13;
(d)   incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis according to the following program: 80%&#13;
in FY96 and FY97. 60% in FY98 and FY99, and 40% in FY2000 and thereafter.&#13;
3.61         IDA will disburse against certified statements of expenditure (SOEs) for: (a) civil works and&#13;
goods contracts below US$200,000 equivalent; and (b) training, afforestation works, field works and incremental&#13;
staff salaries, allowances and operating costs. Disbursement applications for all other items will be fully&#13;
documented. Supporting documentation for SOEs will not be submitted to IDA, but will be retained by&#13;
GOPun jab and be made available to IDA staff during supervision.&#13;
3.62         To facilitate timely project implementation, PFD will open a special account for IDA project&#13;
funds with the National Bank of Pakistan with an authorized allocation of US$800,000. This account will be&#13;
used for both local and foreign expenditures of less than US$100,000 equivalent under all categories. All&#13;
expenditures above US$100,000 could be submitted directly to IDA for payment without using funds from the&#13;
special account after the implementing agency has made project expenditures. PFD will submit applications for&#13;
replenishment of the account to IDA on a monthly basis (the minimum replenishment being US$50,000) or&#13;
earlier if the account falls below 50% of its allocation. A schedule of disbursements is provided in Annex 3.&#13;
Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.63         The participating entities will establish separate accounts for the project. These accounts, together&#13;
with supporting documentation, including contributions from the Provincial Government, and the Credit, would&#13;
provide a comprehensive record of project financing and expenditures. Assurances are sought from GOP and&#13;
GOPunjab that: (a) these accounts would be maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound auditing&#13;
standards consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA; (b) certified copies of the&#13;
annual financial statements and SOEs. together with the auditor's report, which would comment separately on the&#13;
SOEs. would be submitted to IDA no later than nine months after the close of each fiscal year; and (c) the&#13;
Special Account would be audited annually and an audited statement of the account and the auditor's report will&#13;
be submitted to IDA no later than nine months after the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
Project Organization&#13;
Implementation&#13;
4.01         The Punjab Forest Department will be the main implementing agency for the project with the&#13;
Secretary serving as overall manager. The Department will liaise with the IDA and prepare half-yearly progress&#13;
reports on all aspects of the implementation of these components. During appraisal of the project, the capacity&#13;
of PFD to execute the project as well as its overall capacity to lead sector development were evaluated and&#13;
certain deficiencies related to priority areas of planning, research, monitoring and evaluation, interaction with&#13;
private sector and local communities were deficient (see para. 2.10). Project support is therefore directed&#13;
towards increasing PFD's experience and know how in these areas while building on the Department's present&#13;
experience in farm forestry.&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.02         For overall project implementation, an Administration Unit consisting of one Procurement Officer,&#13;
one Accounts Officer and support staff will be established in the office of the CCF/PD. It will assist the CCF in&#13;
making procurement of goods and equipment, account keeping, audits, preparing half-yearly reports and&#13;
processing disbursement applications. Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) for the project will be carried out by&#13;
the existing CF(M&amp;E) who reports directly to the Secretary of Forestry. The addition of two DFOs (one each&#13;
for the farm forestry and social range/scrub forests components), two SDFO/ROs, one Economist, two&#13;
Statisticians and II technical and support staff will strengthen the M&amp;E office. The primary role of the unit will&#13;
be to maintain a Management Information System (MIS) that will first assist the implementation of the project&#13;
and then monitor other sector development. (See Annex 3, for further details of the scope of the work program&#13;
for the MIS under the project, which will include the monitoring and evaluation of project's implementation, its&#13;
financial management and its socio-economic impacts). The project will finance short-term technical assistance&#13;
at the time of the project launch to aid in the setting up of the MIS and in training personnel. In addition, the&#13;
project will provide financing for the hiring of local consultancies to conduct studies as needed by the Bank for&#13;
its supervision missions.&#13;
4.03         One Chief Conservator of Forests/Project Director (CCF/PD; new position) will head the&#13;
organization. There will be four CFs under him -- three for extension (farm forestry) at Rawalpindi (new),&#13;
Lahore (existing), and Multan (new), and one for Range Management (existing). In Farm Forestry, each Civil&#13;
Division (8) will have a DFO (Extension) and each District (34) an SDFO and 19 Forest Rangers (FRs) will be&#13;
located at Tehsils (about one for two tehsils). The lowest tier will comprise extension workers (Foresters/Senior&#13;
Forest Guards) at Markaz level (354). Only incremental staff, including support staff will be provided. The&#13;
farm forestry incremental staff positions, except some nucleus technical staff, will be discontinued at the&#13;
completion of the project.&#13;
Conduct of Forest Department Operations&#13;
4.04         There is consensus on the need for reorganization of the Forest Department to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of projected benefits under the project. In particular, PFD will have to reconcile the demands of a&#13;
course to alter its current, limited role as protector of state lands with the budgetary constraints that inescapably&#13;
confront public institutions managing forest resources.&#13;
4.05         PFD has already agreed to establish a separate cadre of forest officers under a Social Forestry&#13;
Wing, providing career opportunities as attractive as other career paths within the Department. A chief&#13;
conservator of forests will head this wing. The project will contribute by financing on a declining basis required&#13;
incremental professional and technical personnel and their support staff.&#13;
4.06         Also, if the Forest Department is to expand its role in the range sector beyond one of simply&#13;
undertaking revegetative work on state rangelands to one of executing a rational, socially oriented and integrated&#13;
range management program, it will need to revamp its regulations to allow the recruitment and career&#13;
development of officers with range science backgrounds.&#13;
4.07         Because rational range management -- especially in Pakistan -- will be an essentially human-&#13;
oriented discipline, the PFD will reclassify the Range Management Circle as the Integrated Social Range&#13;
Management Circle to emphasize a new focus not only on range rehabilitation and development of grasslands,&#13;
but on a holistic approach to range ecosystems, including vegetation and livestock, and range economic systems,&#13;
including human needs, values and markets.&#13;
4.08         The project will require that PFD establish appropriate linkages with the Animal Husbandry Unit&#13;
and the Agriculture Department to ensure that the latter focus their attention on livestock improvement and feed&#13;
improvement in villages. The Conservator of the Integrated Social Range Management Circle will have the&#13;
responsibility of maintaining a permanent liaison with related departments in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Proiect Reviews&#13;
4.09         The Administration Unit, with support from the M&amp;E unit, will undertake quarterly reviews of&#13;
progress in implementation. In addition, PFD will carry out a comprehensive review of the project progress in&#13;
the third year of the project, and the Bank would participate in this review. The mid-term review will cover all&#13;
aspects of project implementation and project impact. This review will identify shortcomings, if any, and areas&#13;
of improvement and recommend actions for dealing with them for government's consideration.&#13;
V. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
Benefits&#13;
5.01         The primary benefits of the project include increased rural production, improved productivity and&#13;
environmental quality of forest lands, soil conservation measures, on-farm fodder production, improved public&#13;
sector efficiency in the forest sector, development opportunities for local participation, rural employment and&#13;
income. The investments in farm forestry research, tree improvement and extension are expected to increase&#13;
mainly the quality of forest raw materials. The project is expected to have some dampening effect on&#13;
environmental degradation in scrub forests, rangelands and other forest areas through the rehabilitation of&#13;
wasteland and pasture development. These activities will reduce grazing pressure on natural forest areas and&#13;
enable natural grass and forest cover to re-establish itself and provide vegetative growth which would improve&#13;
the resource base in the project area. Nevertheless, not all of these expected benefits are readily quantifiable.&#13;
5.02         Timber and fuelwood will be the main outputs of the project's farm forestry component. Since&#13;
fuelwood is a main source of energy for both rural and low income urban areas, these incremental production in&#13;
fuelwood will help ease the shortage of fuelwood in both project areas and throughout the country. The increase&#13;
in the supply of fuelwood will favor the realization of a consumer surplus and discourage the increased&#13;
substitution of inferior biomass fuels, such as dung cakes, for wood. This inter-fuel substitution is expected to&#13;
become increasingly prevalent in the future without the project, especially among poor rural and urban&#13;
populations, as fuelwood becomes relatively scarcer. One of the environmental consequences of this process, if&#13;
left unaddressed, is a gradual deterioration of the productivity of farm lands as dung is diverted from its use as a&#13;
manure and soil conditioner. The loss of farm productivity in turn has clear implications for the sustainability of&#13;
rural incomes among the least advantaged.&#13;
5.03        The project should lead to a significant increase in the availability of raw material for industry.&#13;
New processing capacity would most likely be needed to utilize fully this potential incremental supply. The&#13;
anticipation of supplying raw material markets would in fact be the primary motivation behind farmers'&#13;
participation in tree planting. Although farmers will be planting chiefly for these commercial reasons, their&#13;
activity will also produce substantial quantities of fuelwood as a by-product.&#13;
5.04         The pilot timber plantations component would lead to environmental benefits in the form of&#13;
inventories and plans for biodiversity conservation and the demonstration of modes for the rehabilitation and&#13;
sustainable use of Punjab's 285,000 ha of plantations. The demonstration of management systems with increased&#13;
private sector participation is expected to cause an increase in land use efficiency in these plantations and a&#13;
decrease of budgetary allocation from public budgetary resources.&#13;
5.05         The scrub forests and rangelands component, concentrating on the rehabilitation or improvement&#13;
of key resource areas through its micro-planning approach, should enhance the productivity of approximately&#13;
13,600 ha of pasture, along with about 8,300 ha of scrub forests. Additionally, the project will introduce&#13;
improved varieties of fodder crops over an estimated total cropped area of 400-500 ha to improve the farm&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
production of forage. These improvements are expected to benefit about 20,000, mainly poor, rural households&#13;
that are dependent upon common property resources and animal husbandry by increasing their net income by&#13;
about US$36 per household.&#13;
5.06         Financial and Economic Analysis. The table below summarizes the average, expected financial&#13;
and economic rates of return for the field operations of the project. Details of individual derivations are&#13;
provided in the following sections, Annex 3 (Implementation Plan) and in Annex 6 (Financial and Economic&#13;
Analysis, including an appendix of tables). The overall financial and economic rates of return of the project are&#13;
both expected to fall within a range of 12-18 percent.&#13;

The net benefits of farm forestry do not include an assessment of the environmental impact of producing more&#13;
trees on farms, which would likely increase overall returns to the project. Similarly, the results here are likely to&#13;
understate the returns to the social scrub and range component for not accounting for environmental benefits&#13;
accompanying the anticipated changes in the land use. They nevertheless are sufficient to justify the inclusion in&#13;
the project of the pilot activity in social range management. It was not possible to valuate the potential&#13;
environmental and economic benefits of the pilot plantations and institutional strengthening components.&#13;
5.07         The economic analyses used border prices, at August 1994 value, for major tradeable commodities&#13;
derived from World Bank projections of cif or fob values adjusted for local handling and transportation costs to&#13;
the farm gate. The derivation of border prices for major agricultural commodities was based partially on data&#13;
presented in "Pakistan: Irrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy Review" and adjusted for current prices. The&#13;
commodity price projections used were those provided in the World Bank's "Revision of Primary Commodity&#13;
Price Forecasts and Quarterly Review of Commodity Markets -- March 1993." In general, the crop and activities&#13;
budgets of the analysis use the average of prices expected to prevail over the period between 1993 and 2005.&#13;
The prices used in the analysis are listed in tables that follow Annex 6. The border prices for non-tradeable&#13;
commodities that constitute minor project costs were estimated from current local prices using a Standard&#13;
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9. The analysis also applied the SCF to minor costs of tradeable commodities.&#13;
5.08         The economic price for fuelwood was derived partly on the basis of its equivalent kerosene&#13;
content and on an estimate of the medium- to long-term agronomic effects of diverting on-farm use of manure as&#13;
a substitute for wood as a fuel for cooking. An indicative price for industrial grade wood was based on the&#13;
import parity value of manufacturing short-fibre pulp using estimates of local costs of conversion. The financial&#13;
wage for casual labor was priced at Rs 63/day, which was considered to be a reasonable estimate of marginal&#13;
value product. The economic wage was then derived using the SCF.&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.09                  Variations in the benefits or costs of the range development or in the project costs&#13;
associated with this component have little impact on overall project performance: the scale of this pilot effort is&#13;
too small relative to farm forestry to have much bearing on the ERR. Farm forestry benefits are the main&#13;
determinant of the project's rate of return. Keeping all costs at their base levels, a decrease in the incremental&#13;
benefit stream from farm forestry of 40 percent would lower the ERR to the average opportunity cost of capital&#13;
assessed for Pakistan: 10 percent. Further decreases in the benefit stream without compensatory decreases in&#13;
costs would produce a negative overall net present value (NPV) for the project when discounting at 10 percent.&#13;
The sign of the NPV switches with a uniform 95 percent increase in project costs associated with farrn forestry.&#13;
It would take an increase in all costs included in the economic analysis of about 65 percent to switch the sign of&#13;
the NPV if incremental benefits are at their estimated baseline values. Chart I in Annex 6 simulates the&#13;
expected impact of combinations of variations in costs and benefits on expected profitability of project&#13;
investments. The chart shows that performance of the project would depend more upon changes in benefits than&#13;
in costs (see Chart I in Appendix I to Annex 6). The project does not appear to be very sensitive to changes in&#13;
benefits. For example, a uniform decrease in the incremental benefit stream of 20 percent would not switch the&#13;
NPV as long as all costs do not increase at the same time by as much as 30 percent.&#13;
Fiscal Impact and Sustainability&#13;
5.10           On year I of project implementation, the share of government financing of the project will&#13;
compare to about 25% of PFD's expected, without-project, budget --based on historical trends. Starting from&#13;
year 2, this share will be comparable to about 5 to 6% of the expected without-project budget, as indicated in&#13;
Table 5.2 below. The project is therefore not expected to overly stretch PFD's capacity of implementation.&#13;
Support to recurrent costs will further ensure that PFD's capacity is not exceeded. IDA, however, will only&#13;
disburse against incremental recurrent costs and on a declining basis (para. 3.60).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
5.11         At the end of the project implementation period, the institutional and operational costs introduced&#13;
by the project (residual staff salaries, benefits and travel/daily allowances and operational costs in Research and&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation, mainly) would amount to about Rsl I million (US$350,000) per year. These will&#13;
have to be borne in full by PFD but appear reasonable because of their relatively small size (about 1% of&#13;
without-project total PFD budget) and because of the expected relief that policy reforms under the project will&#13;
have on the government's budget. In particular, the combined phase-out of farm forestry seedling subsidies and&#13;
government nursery activities would represent a saving estimated at about Rs6O million (US$2 million) per year.&#13;
The net impact of the project, after completion, would therefore be an increase of more than US$1.5 million per&#13;
year that could help alleviate the overall fiscal condition of the Province or be reallocated to traditionally under-&#13;
funded areas of public sector activity (such as research, poverty alleviation on degraded lands and environmental&#13;
conservation). Additional gains in efficiency are also expected from the future large-scale application of lessons&#13;
of the project's demonstration activities (institutional reform in range/scrub forests and timber plantations).&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
5.12         Community participation in natural resources management is one of the major strategic&#13;
underpinnings of this project and is absolutely necessary for the sustainability of the changes in environmental&#13;
management that the project plans to introduce. The principle of participatory implementation will guide the&#13;
institutional and policy reforms included in the project and should lead to the improved delivery of technical&#13;
services to communities in and around existing forest resources as well as to farmers involved in farm forestry.&#13;
Through participatory implementation, the following areas of Pakistan's natural environment should receive&#13;
beneficial impacts from specific project components:&#13;
(a) Improved Soil and Moisture Conservation: Investments in farm forestry, irrigated timber&#13;
plantations and scrub/range land will lead to increased soil cover, decrease in fallow land, and&#13;
sustainable increase in productivity of the land through improved land management and return of&#13;
more organic matter to farm land; and&#13;
(b) Improved Grazing Conditions: Investments in range rehabilitation and management will lead&#13;
to an increase in the availability of fodder. Participatory management will ensure that this&#13;
increase is sustainable. Already, during project design, a participatory approach was used for the&#13;
definition of acceptable land treatment specifications. This approach will continue through project&#13;
implementation with the interface of multidisciplinary spearhead teams and NGOs who will link&#13;
between government agencies (livestock, agriculture, forestry) and local users of the scrub/range&#13;
project area.&#13;
Project monitoring activities will evaluate the degree of environmental improvement achieved during project&#13;
implementation and detect any sign of non-sustainability of improvements (through over-grazing for example).&#13;
5.13         Carbon Emissions. The accumulating evidence concerning the environmental consequences of the&#13;
residential burning of various types of biomass and petroleum fuels would suggest that forest sector development&#13;
could contribute towards an improvement of Pakistan's balance of greenhouse gases. Looking at the CO2&#13;
emissions per cooking task from household fuels, recent reviews at the World Bank7' have found that total net&#13;
emissions are highest for charcoal, followed by natural gas, kerosene and coal. For wood, the net carbon effect&#13;
depends upon whether the wood is sustainably managed. If sustainably managed, the use of wood represents no&#13;
net carbon emissions. If wood is not drawn from sustainably managed supplies, the net carbon emission effect is&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
positive. The reliance on sustainably-grown and managed fuelwood is more environmentally advantageous than&#13;
reliance on petroleum fuels or non-sustainably managed fuelwood.&#13;
Risks&#13;
5.14         Farm Forestry. For this component, one risk is the possibility that the implementation of the&#13;
phase-out programs for seedling subsidies and government nurseries might be delayed and that planting&#13;
campaigns of previous years in addition to planting under the present project would lead to a destabilization of&#13;
wood markets. However, safeguards built in the project -- such as prior government approval of the timed&#13;
phase-out programs for subsidies and public sector nurseries as well as monitoring of market signals and the&#13;
impact of project activities -- should alleviate this risk. The government, moreover, will have discontinued&#13;
practically all interference in the sub-sector in time for the mid-term review and evaluation.&#13;
5.15         Although PFD will briefly continue the seedling subsidy scheme, the project will reduce the&#13;
possible risks it raises by strictly limiting the total value of subsidy to be made available. In principle, the&#13;
subsidies would be used in those communities where wood markets do not operate well primarily for logistical&#13;
reasons and where the substantial part of the incremental production that might be realized through the project&#13;
would likely not be marketed, but instead be consumed by households.&#13;
5.16         Another possible risk in farm forestry is that, although farmers have been planting with the&#13;
expectation of marketing their wood primarily as a raw material for industry, which would command a higher&#13;
price than would fuelwood, it is as yet unclear that the present capacity of wood-based industries would be able&#13;
to absorb all of the short-rotation production due to come on stream soon from past planting campaigns.&#13;
Moreover, given the difficult environment for industrial investment in Pakistan, it is doubtful that much&#13;
additional capacity would be able to develop quickly, even if short-term prospects of raw material supplies&#13;
appear encouraging.&#13;
5.17         This risk, however, is not expected to be critical. Only about 15% of the wood harvested by&#13;
farmers would be marketed as higher value timber for domestic industry. The great bulk of the wood would be&#13;
sold in the market for fuelwood and this market should be able to absorb without much difficulty the production&#13;
increment preferably directed to industry. The possible realization of lower real prices for raw materials in the&#13;
short term and expectations of non-rising real prices at least in the medium term should provide additional&#13;
incentives for investment in various wood-based industries. Also, as international prices for pulp wood increase,&#13;
there is at least an even chance that the export of wood chips may become feasible, which would provide&#13;
additional marketing opportunities and incentives.&#13;
5.18         Moreover, the project would support the launching of a market information service, provided by&#13;
the private sector, that would assist the planning of wood users and producers. The aim of the service would be&#13;
to assist the development of forward contracts between producers and industrial wood users, encouraging and&#13;
facilitating further investment planning. The extension efforts of the project are also aimed at broadening the&#13;
base of wood producers. With the development and dissemination of market information these activities should&#13;
make aggregate wood supplies less sensitive to short-term price variations than they might otherwise be.&#13;
5.19         Scrub Forests and Range Lands. Bank studies indicate that governments routinely neglect&#13;
problems concerning the state of common property resources within their purview of natural resources&#13;
management. That finding is valid to some extent for Punjab and perhaps represents the greatest risk to this&#13;
component. In part, a potential lack of strong government support might be ascribed to a reluctance of the&#13;
forestry department to modify how it views its role and use of its resources in the subsector in isolation of the&#13;
way it views and conducts its management mandate in other areas. What may pose a particular problem for the&#13;
department is the prospect of accepting a resource management approach that jointly involves the department,&#13;
private sector and communities in decision making, administration and the negotiated sharing of resource&#13;
benefits. Related to this may be the difficulty of the department to cooperate with NGOs (and a risk in having&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
selected NGOs not performing satisfactorily). The project would aim to address this risk by providing TA for&#13;
the facilitation of participatory management of scrub/range land and conducting the proposed Human Resources&#13;
Development study for the sector. Among its outputs, the study should provide an indicative plan for the&#13;
deployment of public and non-public resources within the sector. This plan would provide the basis for&#13;
developing a consensus within the forestry department on the future direction of its role and on the adjustments&#13;
that need to be made within its organization. The training of personnel in support of the study's&#13;
recommendations would also be a high priority of the project.&#13;
5.20         Scrub forest rehabilitation measures will include reseeding and revegetation at selected sites.&#13;
Many areas have poor soils with very limited fertility. There is a risk of failure of some of the revegetation&#13;
attempts. Special care will be made to build on research already undertaken at PARC and PFI to select the most&#13;
adapted species of grasses and trees. Leguminous vegetation will be favored to counteract the limited levels of&#13;
soil fertility.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.01         The following agreements were reached at negotiations. The Borrower, GOPunjab and/or PFD&#13;
will:&#13;
(a)   initiate an in-depth study analyzing the institutional capacity of PFD. The study will be&#13;
completed by June 30, 1997, and its recommendations be considered for execution within&#13;
the present project. The study will be prepared by PFD in consultation with Punjab P&amp;D&#13;
using external and internal TA (para. 3.05);&#13;
(b)   agree with IDA, by December 31, 1995, on an action plan based on the results of the&#13;
environmental study of the public sector timber plantations carried out by PFD and IUCN&#13;
in December 1994. Thereafter, PFD will carry out the agreed action plan (para. 3.06,3.46);&#13;
(c)   implement the agreed program for gradual transfer of commercial nursery activities to the&#13;
private sector. By June 30, 1999 PFD will have discontinued all nurseries activities except&#13;
for the running of model nurseries for research and demonstration (para. 3.12);&#13;
(d)   implement the agreed phase-out program for seedling subsidies throughout the province&#13;
eliminating these subsidies and guaranteed seedling procurement by June 30, 1999. By&#13;
project effectiveness, PFD will set the level of subsidy at no more than 75% of seedling&#13;
production cost (para. 3.15);&#13;
(e)   select suitable consultants, before December 31, 1995 to assist in technical aspects of farm&#13;
forestry promotion and research (para. 3.18);&#13;
(f)   implement the farm forestry training program targeting PFD staff and local farmers (para.&#13;
3.16);&#13;
(g)   cause PFRI to develop in accordance with guidelines satisfactory with IDA, and adopt, by&#13;
December 31, 1995 and thereafter carry out a research program on priority areas of farn&#13;
forestry (para. 3.17);&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(h)    abolish, by July 1, 1995, the permit and tax requirements for the cutting and transport of&#13;
farm forest trees outside of the border area. Permits on conifers and Acacia modesta trees&#13;
will be maintained for environmental protection reasons (para. 3.19);&#13;
(i)   implement the treatment of scrub/rangeland with the participation of local institutions&#13;
according to formal PFD-CO agreements to be cleared with IDA before July 31, 1996&#13;
(para. 3.21, 3.24, 3.35 and 3.36);&#13;
(j)    establish two spearhead teams (micro-planning facilitators) by June 30, 1996 and provide&#13;
training to these teams (para. 3.39);&#13;
(k)   implement training for PFD staff and farmers in participatory range/scrub management&#13;
(para. 3.40);&#13;
(I)    carry out, by June 30, 1996 a range/scrub site selection study in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference agreed with IDA (para. 3.41). Selected sites will be primarily in the Pothwar&#13;
and Thai areas with the possibility of extending this pilot to other areas after IDA&#13;
concurrence (para. 3.20);&#13;
(m)   recruit consultants, by December 31, 1995, to assist in the carrying out of technical&#13;
assistance under the project (para. 3.05, 3.18, 3.44-3.46, 4.09 and Annex 4);&#13;
(n)    provide adequate funds to project entities as outlined in para. 3.54;&#13;
(o)   follow the procurement arrangements outlined in para. 3.55-3.59;&#13;
(p)    GOPunjab would establish acceptable accounting and auditing arrangements as outlined in&#13;
para. 3.63; and&#13;
(q)   initiate a mid-term review of the project during FY 1997 with IDA participation and&#13;
complete the mid-term review by December 31, 1998 (para. 4.09).&#13;
6.02         The IDA Credit will not become effective until: (i) GOPunjab has satisfied IDA that the level of&#13;
farm forestry seedling subsidies are no more than 75% of the actual costs of production (para. 3.15); and (ii)&#13;
ECNEC has approved the project's PC-I and sanctioned project expenditures (para. 3.54).&#13;
6.03         With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be suitable for an IDA credit of&#13;
SDR16.00 million (USS24.87 million equivalent) on standard terms with 35-year maturity. The Borrower would&#13;
be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.&#13;

PUNJAB FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE FOREST SECTOR IN PUNJAB&#13;
1.          Demand and Trade. The consumption of roundwood for use as fuel far outweighs the quantities&#13;
presently used for industrial purposes. For 1993 the Household Energy Strategy Study (HESS) data base&#13;
estimates a roundwood fuel demand of about 13 million m3; whereas, the demand for industrial wood is&#13;
estimated at about 1.8 million m3. This partly reflects the generally relatively nascent and small-scale nature of&#13;
wood based industries in Pakistan. Much of the economic activity generated within the sector therefore revolves&#13;
around the trade of fuelwood.&#13;
2.          There are an estimated 13,530 fuelwood traders in Punjab, of which more than 90 percent are&#13;
involved in retail marketing. In addition, about 1,980 traders market both timber and fuelwood (there are about&#13;
3.500 traders dealing exclusively in timber). It is likely that most of these are also primarily retailers.&#13;
3.          The number employed in the sale of fuelwood is estimated at approximately 28,200. Of these,&#13;
about 20,130, including owners, would be permanently employed in the trade. Of those permanently employed,&#13;
some 17,060 are in involved in retailing; the remaining 3,070 are employed in the wholesale trade.&#13;
Approximately 8,000 are employed part-time, mostly in the retail trade. Revenue in 1991/92 from sales of&#13;
fuelwood is estimated to have been Rs 3,700 million. Over 90 percent of the marketed fuelwood is produced by&#13;
farms.&#13;
4.          A significant portion of the roundwood sold to industries has been hardwood for furniture making.&#13;
The furniture industry, concentrated around Lahore, Gujrat and Chiniot employs possibly as many 10,000 people&#13;
working in about 1,500 shops. Most of the high-quality timber used in the industry is shisham and is produced&#13;
on irrigated plantations and other public lands. Supplies of shisham from these areas, however, has been&#13;
declining for some time, and there is now a severe shortage of veneer quality shisham logs. Although in the&#13;
future, some shisham may also be produced on farms, the supply from this source would be quite limited and&#13;
would not likely be of the quality produced under long rotations.&#13;
5.          Most of the furniture industry is artisanal and small-scale; there are, however, at least two larger&#13;
concerns in Punjab that operate to supply the industry with processed materials. These are Jhelum-based&#13;
chipboard manufacturers that together employ about 800 people. Their raw material is mostly mango and poplar,&#13;
supplies of which appear to be adequate; however, these industries face the same problem of obtaining shisham&#13;
logs of veneer quality, which is required for many of their finished products.&#13;
6.          Most of Pakistan's 40-odd pulp and paper mills are located in Punjab, but none uses domestic&#13;
hardwoods as a source of fibre material. One market pulp mill is under construction with a capacity to produce&#13;
100 tons of kraft pulp per day from eucalyptus. If this business is capable of competing efficiently with&#13;
imported wood pulp then there should be considerable potential to replicate the enterprise to expand the supply&#13;
of raw material to existing local paper industries.&#13;
7.          Energy SuPDIV Considerations. Fuelwood is the most important fuel in Pakistan, supplying over&#13;
50 percent of the energy consumed. The projected demand for fuelwood in Punjab for 1993 is estimated at 17.5&#13;
million tons and is expected to increase at an annual rate of about three percent. The main users of fuelwood are&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
rural households, who also supplement the use of fuelwood with the buming of dung cakes and other inferior&#13;
biomass fuels.&#13;
8.            The expansion of the supply of fuelwood in itself is a desirable outcome not because the effective&#13;
cost of its use ranks favorably with other modem fuels -- it is about as cost effective as kerosene, but far more&#13;
expensive than natural gas or LPG (see the following table) -- but because the population is heavily reliant on&#13;
wood energy and modem energy altematives cannot be made extensively available, technically and economically,&#13;
for some time. It is environmentally and economically worthwhile, as the viability of modem altematives&#13;
develops, to address physical scarcities of fuelwood, promote the sustainability of the fuelwood supply and avoid&#13;
increased substitution into the use of lower quality biomass fuels.&#13;

9.            Interfuel Substitution and Farm Productivity. Although fuelwood use is not a major factor in the&#13;
degradation of forest cover in Punjab, an increasing relative scarcity of wood can lead to other environmental&#13;
consequences. The real price of fuelwood in Pakistan has not increased over the last ten to fifteen years, partly&#13;
due to increasing incomes among some groups (fuelwood is an inferior good), but partly due to its substitution&#13;
with other, lower quality biomass fuels. Especially among poorer households, other biomass fuels, such as cow&#13;
dung and crop residues, are highly substitutable for fuelwood. The use of these biomass sources as fuels instead&#13;
of as manures will lead to a gradual deterioration in soil nutrients and in other physical characteristics of soil,&#13;
unless elements are replaced with the application of chemical fertilizers. For poorer households, the cost of such&#13;
fertilizers may be prohibitive. At best, cash incomes would decline, adding further to the entrenchment of rural&#13;
poverty. Although increases in the price of fuelwood have so far not been observed at regional levels, pockets&#13;
of fuelwood scarcity would add pressure local markets and would propel these developments.&#13;
10.           Interfuel Substitution and Rural Health. Further interfuel substitution among the poor could have&#13;
other human health effects for the women and children who are exposed to a large number of pollutants from the&#13;
ground-level buming biomass fuels in poorly ventilated houses. As dung releases three times the amount of&#13;
suspended particulates produced by the burning of fuelwood, it would be potentially much healthier and less&#13;
costly, in terms of health care costs and lost household labor to bum more fuelwood than dung. As a matter of&#13;
health policy, it should be reasonable to prefer actions that lead to substitution towards fuelwood and other&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
modem fuels to those that maintain or increase dependence on low quality biomass fuels. It should be noted,&#13;
however, that strong correlations between health and the indoor combustion of fuels have not been well&#13;
established, but even if they were, this in itself would not justify the subsidization of modem fuels. What is&#13;
being suggested instead is that increases in the supply of wood that lower the cost of its collection or purchase in&#13;
comparison to other biomass fuels are likely to be substantive steps in the direction of improved rural health.&#13;

PUNJAB FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
THE PROJECT'S LINK TO THE BANK'S FOREST SECTOR POLICY&#13;
1.          The project will be an instrument to attain the forest development and conservation goals outlined&#13;
in the World Bank's forest policy paper, dated june 1991. In particular, it will (a) encourage sustainable&#13;
resource use and discourage deforestation; (b) expand forest resources; (c) develop models for the participation of&#13;
local people in forest management; and (d) foster nature preservation. Under the project, most accessible forest&#13;
resources would be brought under scientific and sustainable management to maximize their contribution to the&#13;
economic, social and environmental goals of the province of Punjab. All forest management activities would be&#13;
carried out according to forest management strategies, which would be continuously updated as new information&#13;
becomes available through resource inventories, socio-economic surveys and environmental studies financed&#13;
under the project. Sustainability would be the main guiding criterion in allocating forest resources to various&#13;
uses. Institutional, technical and procedural systems, which are partly lacking or ineffective today, would be&#13;
established to apply this criterion to all forestry decisions (Human Resources Development subcomponent).&#13;
Resource expansion programs supported by the project would aim to rehabilitate degraded forest areas and lands&#13;
(Rehabilitation of Scrub Forest and Rangelands component) and to introduce production in areas where mixed&#13;
forestry/non-forestry land uses are feasible, complementary and desirable (Expansion of Farm Forestry&#13;
component). Such land management interventions would be designed to balance national and local needs. In&#13;
this context, the project would support a pilot schemes for people's participation in forest development and&#13;
maintenance (Rehabilitation of Scrub Forests and Rangelands). Institutional arrangements to be introduced by&#13;
the project would help secure the preservation of nature and environment and enhance forestry planning and&#13;
operations by inserting social and environmental aspects into the decision-making process.&#13;
2.           For the type of activities supported under the proposed project, the Bank's forestry policy requires&#13;
that several prerequisites be met by the concerned government to justify Bank/IDA involvement. These&#13;
conditions and the corresponding policies and activities supported by the proposed project are summarized below&#13;
(the Bank's conditions are underlined):&#13;
(a)   adoption of policies and an institutional framework to ensure conservation and sustainable&#13;
use of existing forests and to promote active participation of people an the private sector in&#13;
the long-term management of forests. The project has been designed in accordance with a&#13;
policy framework promoting planned utilization and regeneration of forest resources (the&#13;
National Conservation Strategy and Environmental Action Plan); optimizing resource use&#13;
by balancing environmental, social and economic goals; developing systems and methods&#13;
to secure people's participation in planning, managing and utilizing forest resources; and&#13;
strengthening environmental management and nature conservation capabilities. A major&#13;
effort would be made under the project to address the current institutional shortcomings of&#13;
the Punjab Department of Forestry, GoPunjab's main agency for managing forest&#13;
resources.&#13;
(b)   adoption of a comprehensive and environmentally sound forestry conservation and&#13;
development plan that contains a clear definition of the roles and rights of the government,&#13;
the private sector and local dwellers. A key objective of the project would be to ensure&#13;
that all of PFD's forest operations are regulated by up-to-date and scientifically prepared&#13;
- 36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
forest management plans. These plans would be prepared in line with sound economic,&#13;
environmental and social goals. The government has established a framework for the long-&#13;
term protection and development of forest resources in the preparation of a forest sector&#13;
master plan. The project would assist in continuing the planning process to ensure that the&#13;
Master Plan can be updated and revised as and when required.&#13;
(c)    establishinz the institutional capacity to implement and enforce the above commitments.&#13;
With its environment and institutional development components and its provisions for&#13;
technological improvements and training/education, the project would make a major&#13;
contribution to improving the institutional capacity of the PFD to help ensure sustainable&#13;
and socially-minded conservation-oriented forestry.&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
l. The Project&#13;
A. Summary of Project Scope and Objectives&#13;
1.          The purpose of the project is to improve the performance of the forestry sector in Punjab,&#13;
entailing the natural, financial and human resources operating in the sector. The impact of this improvement will&#13;
be an abatement in the deterioration in both quantity and quality of the forest sector's sustainable contribution to&#13;
the welfare of rural and urban households in Punjab. Harvests of wood and other products for energy or for&#13;
other direct consumption by households, or for the development of wood-based industries that generate&#13;
employment and value added will be one form of contribution. Another may also take the form of a consumer&#13;
surplus realized in providing marketed wood energy less expensively. Other contributions would be&#13;
environmental, affecting incomes, for example, by reducing potential losses in agricultural productivity owing to&#13;
the external effects of certain land uses; influencing health; providing amenities; yielding recreational value; or&#13;
providing other intangible natural conservation benefits.&#13;
2.           Characterizing the scope of operations, the main concerns of the project's intervention in the&#13;
sector are to:&#13;
(a)   improve the incentive framework governing the use of resources;&#13;
(b)   improve silvicultural productivity; and&#13;
(c)   improve development planning and the setting of resource management priorities.&#13;
Improving the incentive framework will encompass the decision making regarding investments in and use of&#13;
private, common and public property resources. Improving silvicultural productivity will include improving&#13;
planting materials, husbandry practices and the conduct of research. Improving development planning and the&#13;
setting of priorities will chiefly concern the collection and use of information on resources, and the provision of&#13;
environmental services.&#13;
3.          The chief outcomes or goals of the project will include:&#13;
(a)   conditions that would encourage a broadening of the productive base of wood (for use as&#13;
an industrial raw material and as a fuel) supplied from farm land and timber plantations in&#13;
terms of both numbers of private farmers participating and quantities of wood produced per&#13;
farm or per plantation;&#13;
(b)   demonstrations of scrub forests and rangeland rehabilitation and management that maintain&#13;
the availability of common benefits and forestall the deterioration of resources through&#13;
open access and the exploitative behavior of local populations; and&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
(c)    strengthened local public and community institutions managing the sector in Punjab.&#13;

C. Financial and Economic Analysis&#13;
Summary&#13;
8.           Project benefits include increased rural production, productivity and environmental quality,&#13;
improved public sector efficiency in the forest sector and development opportunities for local participation,&#13;
employment and income. The investments in farm forestry research, tree improvement and extension are&#13;
expected to increase the quantity and quality of forest raw materials. The project is expected to have some&#13;
dampening effect on environmental degradation in scrub forests, rangelands and other forest areas through the&#13;
rehabilitation of wasteland and pasture development. Not all of these expected benefits are readily quantifiable.&#13;
The economic analysis did not cover the studies and mass awareness campaigns for environmental education, and&#13;
the pilot environmental plantations component.&#13;
9.           Such environmental benefits would include, for example, recreation, watershed protection, flood&#13;
control, the productivity of rangelands and the substitution of wood for inferior biomass fuels. Although benefits&#13;
under each of these categories may be realized, a broad consideration of the array of production, consumption&#13;
and environmental impacts would much complicate the analysis. In any case, adequate data to undertake such&#13;
analysis are not available and only proxy measures of such impacts might be made.&#13;
I0.          The project is expected to increase the establishment of trees on farms by an average of about 5&#13;
million trees a year over the ten years following the start of the project, as compared to a the number of trees&#13;
that would be planted in a future without the project. With improvements in per tree productivity under the&#13;
project, this increased rate of planting is expected to lead eventually to an increase in the supply of wood from&#13;
farms by about 8 million tons a year.  Part of this supply would be available for wood-based industries, part&#13;
would satisfy household energy demands.&#13;
11.          Regarding supplies to industry, the project is expected to lead to a sustainable incremental supply&#13;
of approximately 2 million tons of raw material over the course of twenty years. New processing capacity will&#13;
probably be needed to absorb all of this increased output. The anticipation of supplying raw material markets&#13;
would in fact be the primary motivation behind farmers' participation in tree planting. Although farmers would&#13;
be planting chiefly for these commercial reasons, their activity would also produce substantial quantities of&#13;
fuelwood as a by-product.&#13;
12.          The increase in the supply of fuelwood will favor the realization of a consumer surplus and&#13;
discourage the increased substitution of inferior biomass fuels, such as dung cakes, for wood. This inter-fuel&#13;
substitution is expected to become increasingly prevalent in the future without the project, especially among poor&#13;
rural and urban populations, as fuelwood becomes relatively scarcer. One of the environmental consequences of&#13;
this process if left unaddressed is a gradual deterioration of the productivity of farm lands as dung is diverted&#13;
from its use as a manure and soil conditioner. The loss of farm productivity in turn has clear implications for&#13;
the sustainability of rural incomes among the least advantaged. The contribution of the value of this substitution&#13;
to the overall net benefits of the farm forestry component, however, is expected to be relatively small.&#13;
13.          Under the scrub forests and rangelands component, the project will finance physical investments&#13;
improving approximately 13,100 ha of pastures and 8,300 ha of scrub forests. Additionally, the project would&#13;
also extend improved grazing management over 18,200 ha of untreated pastures. The total pasture area projected&#13;
to benefit should amount to approximately 3 1,300 ha. Including the improved areas of scrub forests, the total&#13;
targeted area for improved land management under this component would be about 39,600 ha. The project&#13;
would also would assist the private production of fodder on some 400-500 ha with the introduction of genetically&#13;
improved planting materials. These improvements are expected to benefit about 23,700, mainly poor, rural&#13;

The farm forestry net benefits do not include an assessment of the environmental impact of producing more trees&#13;
on farms, which would likely increase overall returns to the project. Similarly, the results here are likely to&#13;
understate the returns to the social scrub and range component for not accounting for environmental benefits&#13;
accompanying the anticipated changes in the land use. They nevertheless are sufficient to justify the inclusion in&#13;
the project of the pilot activity in range management.&#13;
15.           Overall, the results appear satisfactory and are not critically sensitive to variations in any one cost&#13;
or benefit stream. As described below, these results derive from conservative assessments of quantifiable impacts&#13;
on rural and urban incomes. Moreover, the impacts considered were generally those that would be most directly&#13;
perceived. There are likely numerous secondary environmental net benefits that could also contribute to the&#13;
justification of several components, but for lack of data are not developed here. The general approach to the&#13;
analyses was to examine whether proposed investments could stand primarily on the basis of effects most directly&#13;
relating to the production and consumption of commodities. Such effects would also be the ones most likely to&#13;
be understood and appreciated by personnel screening the project within the GOPunjab and the World Bank&#13;
Group.&#13;
Prices Used in the Financial and Economic Analyses&#13;
16.          The commodity prices used in the financial and economic analyses are listed in Tables I and 2 of&#13;
Appendix I to Annex 6. Project financial costs were expressed at projected end-1994 value, and include duties&#13;
and taxes. The economic cost estimates exclude these elements. Base costs reflect the expenditures of&#13;
comparable provincial government agency operations, including reforestation, soil erosion control, forestry&#13;
extension, staff training, construction contracts and vehicle and equipment purchases. Consultant service costs&#13;
are based on recent contracts for similar services in Pakistan. The cost estimates in the analyses include&#13;
allowances for physical contingencies.&#13;
17.          The economic analyses use border prices for major tradeable commodities derived from World&#13;
Bank projections of cif or fob values adjusted for local handling and transportation costs to the farm gate. The&#13;
derivation of border prices for major agricultural commodities was based partially on data presented in "Pakistan:&#13;
Irrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy Review" and adjusted for current prices. The commodity price&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
projections used were those provided in the World Bank's "Revision of Primary Commodity Price Forecasts and&#13;
Quarterly Review of Commodity Markets -- March 1993." In general, the crop and activities budgets of the&#13;
analysis use the average of prices expected to prevail over the period between 1993 and 2005 (see Annex 6,&#13;
Appendix 1, Table 3).&#13;
18.          The border prices for non-tradeable commodities that constitute minor project costs were estimated&#13;
from current local prices using a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9. The analysis also applied the SCF to&#13;
to minor costs of tradeable commodities.&#13;
19.          The economic price for fuelwood was derived partly on the basis of its equivalent kerosene&#13;
content and on an estimate of the medium- to long-term agronomic effects of diverting on-farm use of manure as&#13;
a substitute for wood as a fuel for cooking. An indicative price for industrial grade wood was based on the&#13;
import parity value of manufacturing short-fiber pulp using estimates of local costs of conversion.&#13;
20.          The financial wage for casual labor was priced at Rs 63/day, which was considered to be a&#13;
reasonable estimate of marginal value product. The economic wage was then derived using the SCF.&#13;
21.          Unit costs and values are expressed in terms of constant end-1994 prices. The appearance of a&#13;
price or unit cost for a commodity or service that remains unchanged through the time horizon of the analysis&#13;
implies that the current price of the commodity or service (also called the nominal price) is adjusting from period&#13;
to period according to the given rate of inflation in the economy. Equivalently, for each period the cost of the&#13;
commodity is not more expensive relative to the prices of most other goods during that period. As long as&#13;
incomes also adjust according to the inflation rate, quantities of goods can be purchased more or less in the same&#13;
quantities as in the first period, and the same decisions can be made as before if all prices and incomes increase&#13;
by the same amount. For many commodities in the analysis there are no particular reasons to assume that&#13;
nominal prices would change by more or less than the general rate of inflation and so no real change, relative to&#13;
1994 prices and incomes is expected. In some instances, however, movements in the real prices of certain&#13;
commodities are assumed to avoid an implication that prices become much more distorted over time. Recent&#13;
government decisions permitting the further deregulation of the pricing of agricultural inputs and the general&#13;
loosening of restrictions binding economic activity and trade, if not reversed, should in the future increase the&#13;
likelihood of closer correlations than realized now between the border and domestic prices for several tradeable&#13;
commodities. As a guarded view, the working assumption of the analysis is that the basic deregulation to date&#13;
will not be reversed, and although pricing is not expected to become more distorted, it is not expected to become&#13;
much less so.&#13;
Farm Forestry&#13;
Introduction&#13;
22.          Discussions of the state of Pakistan's forest sector frequently begin with the observation that&#13;
forests (of all conditions) now cover only a small proportion of the land area and that these remaining resources&#13;
face imminent catastrophic depletion. The ensuing argument made on this observation alone is that tree cover&#13;
should be extended on a massive scale to meet existing wood shortages and expanding, population-driven, future&#13;
demands.&#13;
23.          Historically, however, the forest resources in the areas now constituting Pakistan, may never have&#13;
been very extensive, and the attention to the developing scarcity that gained some prominence under British&#13;
colonial administration is likely to have derived more from the specialized needs of the introduced railroads than&#13;
from a comprehensive assessment of the evolving wood balance. Although the administration and the original&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
technical demands have passed, the forest policies and the approach of national forest sector planning from this&#13;
era have carried considerable momentum.&#13;
24.          As in other instances where market and non-market signals have induced changes in behavior,&#13;
households have formed expectations about and adapted to changes in the availability of wood from traditional&#13;
sources. This much has been demonstrated by recent experience in Punjab. The massive planting of trees on&#13;
farm land over the past nearly ten years has now made farm forestry the largest source of household wood&#13;
supplies in Punjab.&#13;
25.          The essentially financial motivation behind the expansion of farm forestry is attested by the&#13;
Household Energy Strategy Study (HESS) survey that concludes that farmers have planted trees mainly for the&#13;
production of timber for sale. The production of fuelwood, however, is a primary by-product of this activity,&#13;
and so long as farmers perceive financial incentives in the production of timber, the production of fuelwood&#13;
benefits as well. This may appear to be a rather trivial factual statement, but it does express an alternative to the&#13;
strategy presently favored by the Punjab Forest Department (PFD) for increasing wood supplies from private&#13;
lands.&#13;
26.          The PFD prefer a supply-side approach to eliminating a broadening excess demand "gap" for&#13;
fuelwood that would consequently provide a stimulus for further investment in wood-based industries.&#13;
Specifically, the proposal is an expansion of an on-going USAID-financed scheme that encourages on-farrn&#13;
investments in tree planting by selling seedlings to farmers at subsidized prices. The approach seems to embody&#13;
an assumption that. however justified in the context of national planning, linear plantings, or the substitution of&#13;
crops for the establishment of block plantations, would appear attractive now only with a reduction in the current&#13;
cost of investment. Later on farmers would become convinced of the decision expedited by the 'psychological'&#13;
bribe. (At full cost, however, the returns to investments in trees are currently very attractive -- provided that&#13;
farmers do not face cash flow constraints.&#13;
27.          One difficulty with this approach is that it could lead to inappropriate land use decisions. For&#13;
example, without the seedling subsidy, it would not be financially profitable to replace barani crops with a block&#13;
plantation of eucalyptus, except on land of very low productivity. Economically, this is also the case. The&#13;
subsidy, however, depending upon the level of expenditure, is likely to render some uneconomic land uses&#13;
financially acceptable.&#13;
28.          Another concern is that, unless some plans are made in advance, the marketing of wood produced&#13;
from further massive plantings on farm land may face the kind of problems that followed India's farm forestry&#13;
campaigns. In India, partly due to uninformed silvicultural practices. large quantities of wood came onto the&#13;
market in the mid- to late 1980s which could not be sold as timber, although this had been the intention of&#13;
fanners who had planted trees in the early 1980s in response to rapidly rising wood prices during the 1960s and&#13;
1970s. Because of difficulties in accessing other wood-based markets, the disposal of the wood was limited&#13;
mainly to the construction pole market, which subsequently crashed.  Fuelwood markets, equally depressed, also&#13;
offered little relief. Farmers who had expected to receive a minimum income per tree when deciding to plant&#13;
found that they would be fortunate after 1986 to earn ten times less than what they had expected. Many farmers&#13;
consequently began to harvest prematurely and uproot trees to return areas to crops. Although conditions which&#13;
may have exacerbated market operations in India may be absent in Pakistan, the potential for large oscillations in&#13;
Pakistani wood markets, with undesirable financial, economic, environmental and social costs, nevertheless&#13;
appears credible.&#13;
29.          The financial consequences of large wood market oscillations include impacts on incomes for&#13;
consumers and producers, which will in turn have an effect upon the transition between low-quality biomass&#13;
fuels and fuelwood on one hand, and between fuelwood and other fuels and sources of energy on the other. The&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
focus of the project may not be the supply of (wood) energy, yet forest sector development and energy policy&#13;
objectives (and implications) are likely to coincide in many instances. This is such a point. Income is a major&#13;
determinant of decisions to switch from fuelwood to modem fuels, as well as from dung and crop residues to&#13;
fuelwood. The development of wood production and marketing in a way that increases rural income and&#13;
broadens its distribution should also encourage the transition to relatively efficient and clean sources of energy.&#13;
Similarly, consumers could benefit from an increase in their purchasing power if, as a result of forest sector&#13;
development, the supply of fuelwood becomes relatively less scarce, allowing more dung to be used as a soil&#13;
conditioner than would have been used otherwise.&#13;
30.          If large quantities of wood are brought to market and not easily disposed, however, triggering a&#13;
crash in prices, consumers may benefit for a while from very low fuelwood prices, but are then likely to face a&#13;
period of accelerating real price increases to levels above those that prevailed before the crash as former&#13;
producers switch to other activities. Once out, all but the largest producers are likely to stay out until prices rise&#13;
high enough to justify the risk of re-entering the market. Consequently as prices increase in real terms, more&#13;
consumers -- especially among low income groups- -- would switch from purchasing wood to collecting it and&#13;
increase their use of lower quality and less efficient biomass fuels than would have otherwise done had prices&#13;
remained relatively stable at initial levels or at levels that were low but still financially attractive to producers.&#13;
An opportunity would therefore be lost to direct consumption towards using a renewable supply of energy and&#13;
from accelerating the depletion of another. A similar lost opportunity arises from foregone wood producer&#13;
income and its multiplier effects.&#13;
3 1.         The swings in interfuel substitution induced by large market oscillations in turn occasion&#13;
environmental, economic and social repercussions. The economic and environmental consequences are further&#13;
discussed below. Of the social impacts, what is primarily in mind is the health hazards, particularly for women,&#13;
associated with indoor air pollution from household cooking. As dung releases three times the amount of&#13;
suspended particulates produced by the burning of fuelwood, it would be potentially much healthier and less&#13;
costly, in terms of health care costs and lost household labor to burn more fuelwood than dung. As a matter of&#13;
health policy, actions that lead to substitution towards fuelwood and other modem fuels should be preferred to&#13;
those that maintain or increase dependence on low quality biomass fuels. For further discussion on the&#13;
household health aspects of burning various fuels refer to Hosier".&#13;
32.          Clearly, lessening the relative scarcity of wood in Punjab is desirable, but since the supplies of&#13;
wood channelled through the markets are critical, the consequences of wood supply strategies on the operation of&#13;
wood markets should be a prominent concern. Whether the present policy of seedling subsidization has already&#13;
encouraged in Punjab a market-destabilizing overplanting of a few species is debatable, but it is revealing that&#13;
this question has now drawn so much attention. Assuming that the current policy will not destabilize markets,&#13;
whatever benefits the policy may produce must still be weighed against efficiency criteria such as those implied&#13;
by the alternative land use issue described above and against fiscal implications. Given the government's limited&#13;
resources, the subsidies also divert funds from other uses. This consideration is all the more relevant when the&#13;
government borrow for the financing of much of its development budget. Moreover, the subsidies are not likely&#13;
to lead to a sustainable effect on producer behavior unless they are maintained.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
33.          Instead of pushing through an expansion of wood supply through a subsidization scheme one&#13;
could consider a strategy of drawing out a measured supply response through stimulating and/or facilitating a&#13;
demand-led expansion of wood industries and markets. Such a strategy would have two advantages. The first&#13;
relates to the source of incentives for farmers' participation: conditions would be set in place that motivate&#13;
farmers to invest in plantings on the basis of forward sales of raw material and of comparisons to market&#13;
opportunity costs, rather than on the basis of subsidized capital costs. The second relates to the scale of effort:&#13;
plantings for wood industries should be on a scale large enough so that fuelwood, as a by-product, is produced&#13;
on a scale sufficient to generate a consumer surplus. Ideally this strategy would avoid a 'boom/bust' fluctuation&#13;
of supply. i.e., avoid large over- and undersupply or, perhaps more practicably, to have fluctuations occur within&#13;
relatively narrow bands around a medium- to long-term clearing price. Meanwhile, welfare is improved via the&#13;
impact of long-term price trends on rural and urban consumer behavior.&#13;
34.          Industrial demand for wood, however, may not be strong in the absence of good prospects of&#13;
adequate supplies at attractive prices. To some extent a prior demonstration of increased planting may need to&#13;
occur to stimulate a demand-led expansion of wood industries and markets. If farmers are reacting to prospects&#13;
of tuture profits from wood plantings, yet sales prices in the longer run need to be lower to be consistent with a&#13;
demand-led expansion of farm-produced wood, then farmers' per unit costs of production will have to fall to&#13;
mainitain present levels of profit at lower sales prices.  The seedling subsidization has this effect, but very&#13;
weakly. A much better approach, for its long-term fiscal implications alone, would be to lower the per unit cost&#13;
of production through improving the productivity of farms. The present analysis demonstrates this in modelling&#13;
the project's impact of an increase in farm productivity of 25 percent through extension efforts while phasing out&#13;
the current policy of subsidizing seedlings for farmers.&#13;
Approach&#13;
3*5.         The project is "large" in the sense that the project is likely to affect both the quantity and price of&#13;
wood in Punjab. The impact of price changes are only partially accounted for. Price adjustments to reduce&#13;
excess demands in the cash fuelwood market would, for example, lead to some interfuel substitution and affect&#13;
decisions to collect versus to buy fuelwood. If the project leads to a long-term reduction in fuelwood prices, it is&#13;
possible that a switch from collecting to purchasing more fuelwood would benefit the environment and in turn&#13;
benefit rural welfare in general. While the impacts of interfuel substitution have not been estimated, the analysis&#13;
uses price adjustments to calculate benefits in the form of the period-by-period consumer surplus that may be&#13;
realized under the project.&#13;
36.           The approach of the analysis is to model explicitly, over time, the investment responses of wood&#13;
producers to changes in the investment costs of establishing plantings, to improvements in the sustainable&#13;
productivity of their stands, and to adjustments in the market price of wood. This involves developing a&#13;
fi-amework that can account for past observations of wood demand, the development of farm forestry and the&#13;
movement of prices, given some reasonably known technical parameters.&#13;
37.           The chief outputs of the analysis are projected time series of the aggregated marketed output of&#13;
fuelwood and tinber and their composite price. The prices emerging from the analysis are in general not&#13;
equilibrium or clearing prices: wood markets are diffuse and consumers have a range of alternatives to&#13;
purchasing wood. At the same time, producers are not obligated to lower prices to clear their output: population&#13;
growth will continue to exert an upward pressure on prices while producers can postpone harvesting as long as&#13;
this is financially advantageous. The analysis also recognizes that producers, because of the growth period of&#13;
forest rotations, are not in a position to increase production much beyond a certain point in the short term. The&#13;
result is that consumers in the aggregate are generally always in a position of wanting to purchase more wood at&#13;
the current price, but are constrained from doing so because of the limitations of supply. Period by period&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
adjustments in the price of wood can be expected, but not enough to eliminate excess demand. Excess demands,&#13;
of course, would be shifting continually period by period, moving the "goal posts" of adjustment each time.&#13;
38.          Using these time series of outputs and prices with and without the project, the analysis estimates a&#13;
consumer surplus as the main quantifiable benefit over the next twenty years. There likely are environmental&#13;
benefits, but because of the difficulty of isolating identifiable and measurable environmental impacts, they have&#13;
not been explicitly included. The analysis however, indirectly accounts for some environmental impacts in&#13;
adjusting the consumer surplus by the economic conversion factor fuelwood.&#13;
39.          The base rate of return calculation accounts for the project costs of extension and research,&#13;
converted to economic values, and for the incremental costs of establishing plantings. The costs for establishing&#13;
plantings includes investments for replacing growing stock that has come to the end of its useful economic life.&#13;
Results&#13;
40.          The simulation implies that without the project, farmers will be planting out between 40 to 50&#13;
million seedlings a year over the first six years. With the project, planting is higher as farmers respond more to&#13;
increases in the productivity of their investments than to the subsidization of seedlings. The wood price does not&#13;
change sharply, but in the with project situation is also lower period by period as compared to without the&#13;
project. This could be explained by noting that the increases in productivity of the growing stock lowers the cost&#13;
of investment for the farmer per unit of output, and so stimulates more investment. Larger supplies of wood&#13;
decrease excess demand and lead to a decrease in the wood price. In comparison, the seedling subsidy has a&#13;
weaker effect in encouraging investment. In general, the behavior of the system appears consistent with&#13;
observations and with short-term expectations of the forest department regarding the take up of seedlings by&#13;
farmers.&#13;
41.          These results system fairly well reflect the stylized facts of recent farm forestry plantings and&#13;
price movements. The analysis does not claim to present a comprehensive set of causal relationships that explain&#13;
investment behavior, but it does demonstrate a logical mechanism that mirrors the rationale of the component&#13;
and offers sufficient, monitorable conditions for affirming a decision to accept the project.&#13;
42.          Base Rate of Return. The base financial rate of return to the farm forestry development is&#13;
estimated at about II percent. When the value of the resources saved by the government through the removal of&#13;
the seedling subsidies are included in the net benefit stream as incremental resources available to the government&#13;
for development, the rate of return increases to about 14 percent. The base economic internal rate of return,&#13;
excluding the value of additional resources released to the government in phasing out the seedling subsides over&#13;
the project period is estimated at 14.5 percent. Including the value of additional resources to the government, the&#13;
rate of return is estimated at about 19 percent.&#13;
Social Range and Scrub Forests&#13;
Approach&#13;
43.          This pilot component aims to improve the efficiency of traditional grazing systems in promoting a&#13;
working partnership of local pastoral organizations and government institutions for the regulation of the use of&#13;
lands suitable for grazing. Broadly, this partnership would work toward strengthening a sustainable pastoral&#13;
economy, and will be the framework within which land improvement investments would be undertaken and other&#13;
existent services and resources mobilized. Among the expected outcomes of this partnership are land use&#13;
agreements, or contracts that lead to an overall reduction of grazing pressure on pasture and scrub forest areas,&#13;
while increasing overall forage availability and access. The actions producing these outcomes will include&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
rehabilitating or improving high potential pasture areas through soil and vegetative conservation works, reseeding&#13;
and ponding and/or other water harvesting techniques. Areas of scrub forests will be replanted with fodder-&#13;
producing species of trees. Treatments will vary from area to area according to the conclusions of the&#13;
microplanning exercise and the constraints of agroclimatic and geophysical characteristics. Feed supplementation&#13;
from farm production, where possible and economic, will be promoted. The project will also concentrate on&#13;
animal health. Above all, the project will work, in assessing the potentials of all grazing lands and pastures&#13;
within the catchment areas of communities, including public and private lands, to adapt stocking and marketing&#13;
strategies in ways that enhance forage utilization in consideration of animal performance. This might involve,&#13;
among other measures, the introduction of rotational grazing arrangements on public land and greater access to&#13;
marketing information to guide the acquisition and disposal of stock.&#13;
44.          Apart from its environmental aspects, the component will also contribute toward poverty&#13;
alleviation. Its activities will involve and affect the poorer segments of the rural population. Operating in the&#13;
Pothwar Plateau and Thal areas, the project should add to the cash incomes of households who generally hold&#13;
little productive, arable land.&#13;
45.          There is also a likelihood that a significant fraction of rural women will benefit through the&#13;
project since women are in fact engaged in much of the herding. Although this work by women is generally not&#13;
openly admitted, it exists and is tolerated because of the necessity for male members of households to seek&#13;
employment outside the community.&#13;
46.          To measure the project's potential impact on incomes, the analysis considers a generalization of&#13;
the current conditions facing poorer villages in the project areas, based on the results of the socio-economic&#13;
surveys conducted by the preparation mission. These have led to estimates of the average size of the shamiat&#13;
area of these villages, its current productivity and exploitation, the average size of the village, expressed in sheep&#13;
units (SUs) (most of the animals to be affected would be small stock), and the capacity and level of use of other&#13;
sources of fodder. The labor time required for keeping livestock has been estimated, along with the average&#13;
value of income per sheep unit realized from the sales of culls, wool and household consumption of meat. In the&#13;
without project situation, the productive value of animals gradually decreases over time to reflect deteriorating&#13;
conditions of forage supply and quality as well as the longer distances over which animals would eventually be&#13;
grazed.&#13;
Results&#13;
47.          The analysis estimated project financial internal rates of return (IRRs) for the developments&#13;
involving 68 communities in Pothwar and 32 communities in Thal. To the two areas the analysis apportioned&#13;
the project costs for community extension, including the purchase and operation of heavy equipment, vehicles,&#13;
the construction of staff offices and housing, equipment and tools, portion of component technical assistance and&#13;
training, incremental staff salaries and other overhead expenses. Residual values for heavy equipment, vehicles&#13;
and office equipment partially offset incremental project costs at the end of the project's implementation period.&#13;
For the Pothwar development the financial internal rate of return was estimated at approximately 17 percent. For&#13;
Thal, the IRR was estimated at 15 percent. The rate of return of the component as a whole is estimated at 16&#13;
percent (the calculation is displayed in Annex 6, Appendix 1, Table 7). This result is not very sensitive to small&#13;
variations in the benefit or cost streams.&#13;
48.          For the economic analysis livestock revenue was converted into its economic value using a&#13;
conversion factor of 0.60, which was derived from a calculation of the average import parity value of mutton&#13;
produced in barani areas in central Punjab. Using economic values for inputs, outputs and project costs, the&#13;
economic internal rate of return (ERR) for Pothwar was estimated at 15 percent and for Thal at 11 percent. The&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
rate of return for the component in aggregate amounts to about 12 percent. See Appendix 1, Tables 4 and 6 for&#13;
the calculations of the economic budgets of grazing and husbandry development in Pothwar and Thal. Annex 6,&#13;
Appendix 1, Table 7 presents the calculation of the analysis.&#13;
Overall Project Results&#13;
Base Rates of Return&#13;
49.          Overall project rates of return were estimated on the basis of the net benefit streams of the farm&#13;
forestry and social range and scrub forest components, and the costs of institutional support under the project,&#13;
which include Human Resource Development, incremental administrative operating expenditures and the&#13;
establishment and operation of M&amp;E facilities. The base financial rate of return (IRR) of the project was&#13;
estimated at 12-15 percent. The base economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated to range from 14 to 18&#13;
percent.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
50.          Variations in the benefits or costs of the range development or in the project costs associated with&#13;
this component have little impact on overall project performance: the scale of this pilot effort is too small&#13;
relative to farn forestry to have much bearing on the ERR. Farm forestry benefits are the main determinant of&#13;
the project's rate of return. Keeping all costs at their base levels, a decrease in the incremental benefit stream&#13;
from farm forestry of 40 percent would lower the ERR to the average opportunity cost of capital assessed for&#13;
Pakistan: 10 percent. Further decreases in the benefit stream without compensatory decreases in costs would&#13;
produce a negative overall net present value (NPV) for the project when discounting at 10 percent. At the base&#13;
level of incremental benefits, project costs associated with project activities plus institutional support costs, but&#13;
excluding the investment costs and incremental operating costs of the activities themselves, would have to&#13;
increase uniformly by about 90 percent to switch the sign of the project's NPV. Separately, institutional support&#13;
costs have a switching value of about 1900 percent: their contribution to overall project costs is small. In&#13;
contrast, the sign of the NPV switches with a uniform 95 percent increase in project costs associated with farm&#13;
forestry. It would take an increase in all costs, including all investment and incremental operating costs of&#13;
activities, of about 65 percent to switch the sign of the NPV if incremental benefits are at their estimated&#13;
baseline values. Combinations of variations in costs and benefits show that the performance of the project would&#13;
depend more upon changes in benefits than in costs (see chart I in Appendix I to Annex 6). Still, the project&#13;
does not appear to be exceptionally sensitive to changes in benefits. For example, a uniform decrease in the&#13;
incremental benefit stream of 20 percent would not switch the NPV as long as all costs do not increase at the&#13;
same time by as much as 30 percent.&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
11. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
A. Overall Responsibility&#13;
51.          While GOP have overall liability for the IDA credit agreed to with the Bank, GOPunjab will&#13;
execute the project. GOP will make the proceeds of the IDA credit available to GOPunjab as the primary part of&#13;
its assistance to the implementation of the project. GOPunjab shall carry out the project and shall provide, or&#13;
cause to be provided, as needed, the funds, facilities, services and other resources required for the project.&#13;
B. Implementing Agency&#13;
52.          The Punjab Forest Department will be the main implementing agency for the project on behalf of&#13;
GOPunjab with the Secretary serving as overall manager. The Department will liaise with the IDA and prepare&#13;
half-yearly progress reports on all aspects of the implementation of these components.&#13;
53.          One Chief Conservator of Forests/Project Director (CCF/PD; new position) will head the&#13;
organization. There will be four CFs under him -- three for extension (farm forestry) at Rawalpindi (new),&#13;
Lahore (existing), and Multan (new), and one for Range Management (existing). In Farm Forestry, each Civil&#13;
Division (8) will have a DFO (Extension) and each District (34) an SDFO and 19 Forest Rangers (FRs) will be&#13;
located at Tehsils (about one for two tehsils). The lowest tier will comprise extension workers (Foresters/Senior&#13;
Forest Guards) at Markaz level (354). Only incremental staff, including support staff will be provided. The&#13;
farm forestry incremental staff positions, except some nucleus technical staff, will be discontinued at the&#13;
completion of the project.&#13;
54.          For overall project implementation, an Administration Unit consisting of one Procurement Officer,&#13;
one Accounts Officer and support staff will be established in the office of the CCF/PD. It will assist the CCF in&#13;
making procurement of goods and equipment, account keeping, audits, preparing half-yearly reports and&#13;
processing disbursement applications. Monitoring and evaluation for the project will be carried out by the&#13;
existing CF(M&amp;E) who reports directly to the Secretary of Forestry. The addition of two DFOs (one each for&#13;
farm forestry and range), two SDFO/ROs, one Economist, two Statisticians and II technical and support staff&#13;
will strengthen the M&amp;E unit. The primary role of the unit will be to maintain a Management Informnation&#13;
System (MIS) that will first assist the implementation of the project and then monitor other sector development.&#13;
See below for further details of the scope of the work program for the MIS under the project, which would&#13;
include the monitoring and evaluation of project's implementation, its financial management and its socio-&#13;
economic impacts. The project would finance short-term technical assistance at the time of the project launch to&#13;
aid in the setting up of the MIS and in training personnel. In addition, the project will provide financing for the&#13;
hiring of local consultancies to conduct studies as needed by the Bank for its supervision missions.&#13;
B. The Role of the Bank&#13;
55.          The Bank will supervise the project starting with a mission to launch the project following credit&#13;
effectiveness. Following the project launch, the Bank will conduct three semi-annual reviews before a mid-term&#13;
review, now scheduled within the third year of the project's implementation. A semi-annual review will follow&#13;
the mid-term review and then two annual reviews. A final Bank mission to review the project's completion will&#13;
take place after the close of the project.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
C. Administrative and Implementation Arrangements for Farm Forestry&#13;
56.           The delivery system will pattern the provincial civil administrative structure, rather than the&#13;
PFD's, to provide better coordination with other line departments, facilitate monitoring and ensure even&#13;
extension coverage throughout Punjab. One extension forester (Forester or Forest Guard) will be posted to each&#13;
of the 354 Markazs (there are an average of 66 villages per Markaz). One Forest Ranger will supervise the&#13;
Extension Foresters in two Tehsils and there will be an SDFO to supervise Forest Rangers in each of the 34&#13;
Districts. A DFO will be posted to each Divisional HQ. Three Conservators of Forests (CF) one each at&#13;
Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan will provide the overall supervision required to implement this component.&#13;
Heading the Farm Forestry Wing and Scrub/Rangeland conservancy will be the CCF(PD) stationed in Lahore.&#13;
Professional staff requirements will be as follows:&#13;

57.           The project will finance these incremental staff: 58 professional, 70 technical staff, including&#13;
drivers, and 162 support staff.  PFD will provide the remaining technical staff requirements through transfers.&#13;
By the end of the project the PFD will absorb all technical staff below the level of CF, except for 34 Forest&#13;
Rangers who will remain at the Tehsil level to ensure continued farmer access to technical assistance. The&#13;
CCF(PD) and two CF posts will then discontinue, leaving one CF at the center.&#13;
58.           Delivery Mechanisms for Seedling Subsidies. In its tree-planting campaigns PFD has provided&#13;
seedlings to farmers virtually free of cost. Under this project the subsidy will be phased out over four years:&#13;
75% in year 1, 60% in year 2, 40% in year 3, 25% in year 4 and 0 in years 5 and 6. Under the current system,&#13;
when the farmer collects his/her seedlings from the private nurseryman, payment of the non-subsidy element is&#13;
made (e.g., in year 1 of the project this would be 25% of Rs 1.75 or Rs 0.45 per seedling). The nurseryman is&#13;
not paid the balance or subsidy element (in this case Rs. 1.30 per seedling) until the number of seedlings actually&#13;
planted by all the farmers obtaining seedlings from his/her nursery has been verified in the field by a forest&#13;
officer. Delays in the final payment (crossed check) to the nurseryman, by the DFO or his designate, sometimes&#13;
run into months. It is the nurseryman who is penalized if the seedlings are not planted, not the farmer. The&#13;
present project will intervene to simplify the process. One approach would be for a forest officer to make&#13;
payment (of the subsidy element) once he has verified that the nursery contains the contracted number of quality&#13;
seedlings of the correct species. As before, the farmer would pay the non-subsidy element on collection of the&#13;
seedlings. This would ensure prompt payment to the nurseryman and a reduction in the number of PFD staff&#13;
involved in the process. The project will use sampling techniques to determine the number of seedlings planted.&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
IDA and GOPunjab will agree on a suitable system during negotiations. In addition, the subsidies would be&#13;
targeted toward poor households.&#13;
59.          Under an expenditure category of marketing services, project financing will support the&#13;
contracting of private sector services to provide periodic assessments of current marketing prospects and trends&#13;
for various raw materials and to produce information on wood purchase contracts and prices for regular&#13;
dissemination by radio or through other suitable mass media. The project will also employ the private sector for:&#13;
(a) introducing a log grading system based on measurements that can be made by the farmer; (b) advising on&#13;
harvesting (felling, bucking, logging) practices; (c) improving linkages between the producer (farmer) and the&#13;
user (industry); (d) determining the role of the middle man in marketing; (e) creating a data base; and (f)&#13;
developing a marketing strategy. The Bank would agree on the procurement and contracting of these services.&#13;
60.          Phasing Out of PFD Nurseries. There are some 700 PFD nurseries currently providing farm&#13;
forestry seedlings requirements. These will be phased out by year 5 and replaced by over 1,000 farmer nurseries,&#13;
which are expected to be established by the same year. The project anticipates the following phasing of&#13;
nurseries:&#13;
Table 7. Phasing Out of PFD Nurseries&#13;
Number of Nurseries&#13;
Year     0          1         2          3         4          5          6&#13;
PFD            700        560        280       210        140        0          0&#13;
FF              0         200        620       720        830       1035       1035&#13;
Numbers for the PFD are firm but only indicative for the private farmer nurseries (FF), assuming an average of&#13;
three per Markaz.&#13;
61.          Targeting of Extension Activities. Although generally all farmers will have access to the&#13;
informational services of the project, extension activities will be organized primarily around groups of farmers&#13;
who hold each arable holdings of land of five hectares or less to broaden the production base of farm forestry.&#13;
These farmers, who form the largest percentage of cultivators, are greatly under-represented among participants&#13;
of previous farm forestry campaigns. As a group, these farmers constitute much of the rural poor in Punjab.&#13;
Moreover, the delivery of seedling subsidies will be directed towards those farming communities where average&#13;
household income are below the median income for the province, where farm tree planting is an unfamiliar&#13;
practice and where wood would be produced primarily for home consumption as fuel. As a working figure, poor&#13;
households whose per capita income falls at or below Rs 400 per month.&#13;
D. Administrative and Implementation Arrangements for Social Range and Scrub Forest Management&#13;
(SRSFM)&#13;
62.           Existing PFD staff from the Range Management and Rawalpindi Circles, under their respective&#13;
Conservators of Forests, will implement the component; however, over the course of the implementation the&#13;
project will provide financing on a declining basis for one draftsman and 18 technical and support staff to aid the&#13;
expansion of the work program in the two target areas. The professional staff implementing this component will&#13;
report to the Chief Conservator of Forests (Project Director), Lahore. By the end of the project professional staff&#13;
will return to their regular postings and contracts for other support and technical staff would be completed.&#13;
63.          Two specially trained spearhead teams will assist and train PFD field staff in the processes of&#13;
forming Community Organizations, participatory planning, and formulating joint agreements. Each spearhead&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
team will consist of three Forest Department staff (a DFO, an SDFO, and a Forest Ranger) and two resource&#13;
persons. The project will recruit resource persons with skills in participatory appraisal and planning techniques&#13;
from universities, research institutes, and NGOs specializing in training in participatory work. Of the two&#13;
resource persons on each team, one will be a specialist in institution building and community development, and&#13;
the other in livestock and rangeland management. Spearhead teams will in all cases work alongside local FD&#13;
field staff, who will take responsibility for continuing SRSFM work in communities.&#13;
64.          The operation of this component will consist of a number of sequential steps; namely, the&#13;
selection of the villages, the motivation of the villagers, the formation of a community organization so that the&#13;
villagers can operate as a group, the microplanning of work to be carried out in the village in the project period,&#13;
and the execution of the microplan. Except for instances when an NGO is operating, all of these steps will fully&#13;
involve PFD.&#13;
65.          Selection of Villages. The PFD along with the NGOs will select villages on the basis of the&#13;
following criteria:&#13;
(a)   the people of the village are willing to participate in the program;&#13;
(b)    within reasonable distance of the village sufficient range and scrub forest land is available&#13;
for rehabilitation;&#13;
(c)   the site quality of the available land is satisfactory (this would ensure that there is more&#13;
likelihood of the success of the program which would encourage others to emulate); and&#13;
(d)   the villages are distributed as far as possible in different forest ranges which will allow&#13;
sharing of the workload by staff posted in different parts of the Pothwar and Thal areas.&#13;
Selection of the villages should be completed at least a year in advance of the year when the work will be&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
66.          Motivation of the villagers, grou, formation, signing of agreement and entitlement of the villagers&#13;
for participation. Wherever possible, the project will engage NGOs to carry out the work of motivation of the&#13;
villagers. The NGOs will work under the administrative guidance of the local PFD. Where NGOs are not&#13;
available, the PFD will carry out this task. The motivation work will consist of meeting the villagers&#13;
individually and in mass meetings to explain to them the program, to understand what their reactions are, to find&#13;
out whether they are interested to form village organization to participate in the program, their responsibilities&#13;
and the benefits that they would be entitled to as compensation. If through these interactions, a majority of the&#13;
villagers agree to participate, the NGO or the PFD will assist the villagers to form a representative group drawn&#13;
from as many families as possible but not exceeding 20 members. The group should include at least four landless&#13;
people. The group would then sign with the PFD an agreement specifying the program, the responsibilities of&#13;
the parties, the cost and benefit shares and the penalties in the breach of the agreement. The general principles&#13;
to be incorporated in the agreement follow. Preferably, PFD will appoint an NGO at the time of the project&#13;
launch to standardize a document containing the methods to be followed in motivation and group formation&#13;
work.&#13;
67.          The project will provide the following entitlements to the villagers:&#13;
(a)   individuals who agree to rehabilitate their private range land will receive as an incentive&#13;
free grass seeds and tufts, some assistance in land preparation with the provision of tractors&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
with attachments and diesel (the total cost of this assistance not exceeding about Rs 700&#13;
per ha) and free technical advice;&#13;
(b)   in the case of rehabilitation of common, state and FD range lands, the project will bear the&#13;
total cost of rehabilitation while the Community Organization (CO) will be responsible for&#13;
the protection of the land and the regulation of grazing as specified in the microplan. In&#13;
exchange for this support, the CO will be entitled to a compensation of Rs 625 per month&#13;
for every 50 ha of range land (i.e. Rs 150/ha per year) and allowed grazing at a fee per&#13;
grazing cattle;&#13;
(c)   in fodder plantations, the project will finance the cost of planting. The CO will be&#13;
responsible for its protection and for the regulation of grass cutting and lopping. The&#13;
members of the village will receive free grass, free lops and tops and about 20% (to be&#13;
decided by the government) of the final product when the plantation is be finally felled;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   the project will finance the cost of scrub forest rehabilitation work while the protection of&#13;
the area from misuse will be the responsibility of the CO. The CO will be entitled to free&#13;
grass cutting, spaced or thinned fuelwood free of royalty and 20% of the final product&#13;
when the forest is felled.&#13;
68.          Microplanning. PFD, NGOs and COs will jointly prepare microplans. The microplan will be a&#13;
brief document in the local language consisting of the following sections. It has to be understood that&#13;
microplanning is not an elaborate exercise intended to document precise quantitative data and rigid targets. On&#13;
the other hand, it is proposed to be an indicative document specifying indicative targets, responsibilities of&#13;
different parties and their entitlements. The plan will form a part of the agreement that the CO will sign with&#13;
the PFD.&#13;
69.          The first section in the microplan will, along with a map, list the land available (i.e., agreed to be&#13;
spared) for private, non-private range land and FD scrub forest rehabilitation work in the project period. It will&#13;
also indicate whether any other similar schemes or operations are being carried out. If there are other activities&#13;
under way, the plan would explain how the present scheme would not duplicate ongoing work. The second&#13;
section of the microplan will tabulate a tentative target for the project period and approximate the forest&#13;
production and the number of grazing cattle, or other livestock, that the area would ultimately bear. The third&#13;
section will specify the costs and the responsibility of the parties in sharing it, while the final section will&#13;
indicate the benefits and the entitlements of each party and how the benefits would be provided.&#13;
70.          Rangeland Imnrovement. Depending on the existing quality of the range, the area will be either&#13;
revegetated or reseeded. If the range has sufficient increasers, revegetation will be carried out, which would&#13;
consist of protection for a few years followed by regulated grazing. If the range is in poor condition, the&#13;
existing vegetation-will be removed by disc plough, cultivated and seeds of appropriate species of grasses and&#13;
legumes will be broadcast. For shade, about 100 seedlings of non-grazable species will be planted in 30 x 30 x&#13;
30 cm holes. If the reseeding is successful, the reseeded area would be protected for the first three years and then&#13;
opened for regulated grazing.&#13;
71.          There will be no fencing for the revegetation or the reseeded area. The CO will arrange suitable&#13;
supervision of the area during its closure and will regulate grazing on it afterwards. The CO will receive a&#13;
compensation for this support as mentioned above. Revegetation and reseeding will be planned so that sufficient&#13;
areas are kept open for grazing.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
D. Administrative and Implementation Arrangements for Timber Plantations Pilot Component&#13;
72.          This component will be under the overall direction of the CCF/Project Director and will be&#13;
implemented by existing staff of the PFD at headquarters and in the various plantations to be covered by studies&#13;
and/or demonstration of management systems. Technical assistance will be used for the following studies: (i)&#13;
environmental/biodiversity inventories and rapid socio-economic surveys covering all public sector plantations;&#13;
(ii) selection of three representative plantations for detailed implementation of a demonstration project on the&#13;
rehabilitation of plantations for multipurpose use (conservation and commercial); (iii) design of models for&#13;
financially and environmentally sustainable involvement of the private sector in plantation management; (iv)&#13;
design of rehabilitation and improvement plans for land and water resources of the plantations to maximize its&#13;
multipurpose output, biodiversity conservation in particular.&#13;
73.          Rehabilitation of water management and irrigation systems in selected plantations: this&#13;
rehabilitation will follow the methodology and criteria followed in the Second Irrigation System Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (ISRPII). PFD would obtain from the Punjab Irrigation Department all pertinent information,&#13;
specification and other model documents for adaptation to rehabilitation works in the irrigated plantations. PFD&#13;
would contract, through the use of TA and service funds, the assessment of water ditribution systems in the three&#13;
selected plantations and determine the nature and extent of problems with respect to needs under the proposed&#13;
land-use objectives of every compartment of the three plantations (as defined in IUCN's Study on Environmental&#13;
&amp; Ecological Considerations for Management of Punjab's Irrigated Plantation, December,1994). This&#13;
preliminary survey work will result in a set of Condition Survey documents that will be submitted, along with&#13;
proposed solutions, to IDA for review and comment. At this stage, a formal determnination of respective&#13;
authorized entitlements for water of the three plantations will be required. Rehabilitation work will include canal&#13;
bank rehabilitation, and, if needed, restoring canal prisms to their normal section by cleaning or the use of brush&#13;
and stakes as sediment traps, modification of selected structures and outlets. No systematic, large scale lining of&#13;
canals will be implemented. Once the works have been approved by IDA they will be contracted out by PFD&#13;
according to IDA guidelines.&#13;
E. Accounts and Audit&#13;
74.          To facilitate timely project implementation, PFD will open a special account for IDA project&#13;
funds with the National Bank of Pakistan with an authorized allocation of US$800,000. An account will be&#13;
allocated to the office of the Project Director stationed at Lahore. This account will be used for both local and&#13;
foreign expenditures of less than US$100,000 equivalent under all categories. All expenditures above&#13;
US$100,000 could be submitted directly to IDA for payment without using funds from the special account after&#13;
the implementing agency has made project expenditures. PFD will submit applications for replenishment of the&#13;
account to IDA on a monthly basis (the minimum replenishment being US$50,000) or earlier if the account falls&#13;
below 50% of its allocation. This account, together with supporting documentation, including contributions from&#13;
the Provincial Government, and the Credit, will provide a comprehensive record of project financing and&#13;
expenditures. PFD will have the account audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards&#13;
consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA. PFD will submit to IDA certified&#13;
copies of the annual financial statements and Statements of Expenditure (SOEs), together with the auditor's&#13;
report, which would comment separately on the SOEs, no later than nine months after the close of each fiscal&#13;
year.&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
III. Implementation Schedule&#13;
The Timing of Project Events&#13;
75.                 The following table presents an indicative scheduling of the project's overall&#13;
implementation including procurement events, summary component activities and supervision. Using scheduling&#13;
software, PFD will establish a file similar to this one -- and other project component files as necessary -- at the&#13;
time of the project launch, taking into account IDA recommendations on the level of detail in which to define&#13;
some of the tasks. PFD will share this file or files with IDA, along with GIS and financial files, and produce&#13;
updated versions in time for IDA supervision missions.&#13;
The Use of Scheduling Software&#13;
76.          Scheduling software are computer applications for time management that facilitate the break down&#13;
of some project into a sequence of constituent tasks whose duration and relationship to one another can be&#13;
presented graphically in a chart. Such programs are useful for communicating the process by which a project is&#13;
to be implemented, but they typically have more powerful capabilities. They would likely also allow the linking&#13;
of resources to defined activities and so assist the planning of the use of available resources. After defining tasks&#13;
in appropriate detail, specifying task relationships and assigning resources to tasks, a manager using the software&#13;
could record data on the actual use of resources and the completion of tasks once the project is under way to&#13;
produce reports on the status of the project's implementation, including the rescheduling of planned tasks and&#13;
their completion times. In the present context, the PFD will use scheduling software to plan the activities of the&#13;
components in detail and to communicate information on their progress for its own use as the chief implementing&#13;
agency and for IDA's supervision of the project. The structure of tasks for the project's components can in turn&#13;
structure the use of a financial management software package, which would be used to provide the accounting&#13;
data that scheduling software files require in tracking the use of resources. The software would then be used to&#13;
produce reports that would expedite PFD's dialogue with IDA regarding the use of funds and disbursements.&#13;
77.          PFD will use scheduling software not only to schedule the implementation of individual project&#13;
components, but as a tool employed in combination with financial management and GIS software to track&#13;
changes in the state of forest sector against applications of resources under the project. The information on the&#13;
status of resource use and task completion which is stored in the MS Project file can be "exported" into the&#13;
tabular form of a data base. This data base can then be combined with others registering information associated&#13;
with geographic locations of interest to the project. The GIS software would then employ this extended data&#13;
base, which would also contain socio-economic data and sectoral monitoring data on the project's impact such as&#13;
indicators of the performance of farm forestry plantings, nurseries, the performance of COs, the status of joint&#13;
management agreements and rehabilitated range lands, etc., to convey information through maps. In combining&#13;
the use of software in this way, PFD will be able, for example, to show where in the province resources for&#13;
extension are employed and where changes in the farm production of wood by product and quantity are&#13;
occurring.&#13;
78.          For farm forestry, PFD can establish extension implementation schedules for separate divisions of&#13;
the province. These could then be combined as the subprojects of a provincial Project File. Project management&#13;
would likely also set up separate files for the scrub forests and rangelands in Pothwar and Thal, and, if&#13;
appropriate, for subregions within these two areas.&#13;

IV. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
A. Progress of Implementation&#13;
Monitoring Physical Achievements and Progress Reporting&#13;
79.          The project's monitoring system will be designed to record basic physical progress and financial&#13;
data required to assess the status of the project's implementation and evaluate its financial management. The&#13;
project management office will periodically report on the progress of project implementation, including actual&#13;
accomplishments versus planned tasks, and actual expenditures versus planned allocations.&#13;
80.          The project management unit will present these data in semi-annual reports, which will serve the&#13;
Bank as well as GOPunjab in providing a common frame of reference for analysis and decisions. The report's&#13;
summary of the project status will describe project implementation within the reference period, commenting on&#13;
the situation for each component and on progress of the project as a whole. They will indicate advances as&#13;
scheduled and agreed with the Bank, as well as the project's general impact to date. The report will provide&#13;
information on financial management. Questions and problems from prior reports will be addressed, and new&#13;
or remaining questions will also be discussed. Implementation and impact indicators will be provided in a&#13;
format to be designed and agreed upon at the time of the project's launch. The reports will also indicate the&#13;
status of compliance with legal covenants.&#13;
81.          The presentation of each semi-annual report should use the following outline:&#13;
1.    Executive Summary&#13;
2.    Project Status&#13;
- Implementation by Component&#13;
Implementation Indicators&#13;
Compliance with Legal Covenants&#13;
- Significant Developments since the Previous Report&#13;
3.    Project Administration&#13;
- Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
- Coordination among Involved Institutions/Departments&#13;
4.    Financial Reporting&#13;
- Disbursements&#13;
- Acquisition Procedures&#13;
- Financial Reports&#13;
- Project Technical Assistance&#13;
5.    Project Evaluation&#13;
- Problems and Recommended Corrective Actions&#13;
82.          The semi-annual reports will include tables of implementation indicators, expenditure indicators&#13;
and status of legal covenant indicators.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Monitoring of Socioeconomic Benefits&#13;
83.          The project's monitoring will also link physical progress and financial monitoring with monitoring&#13;
that evaluates impacts on local communities and individual beneficiaries. The project will undertake&#13;
representative household surveys and field investigations to measure the impact with and without the project.&#13;
Special attention will be given to measuring changes in output due to investments in land development and to the&#13;
grazing management improvements introduced under the project. Household investigations will also measure&#13;
the project's impact on increasing household wealth and on improving access to public services. These data will&#13;
be retained in the project's overall information system to allow for the establishment of correlations between&#13;
investments and financial, economic and social benefits.&#13;
B. Management Information System&#13;
84.          The project will support the establishment of a computer-based Management Information System&#13;
(MIS) based on a set of related if not integrated personal computer software applications to facilitate the&#13;
management of financial, temporal and spatial information. The applications under consideration for&#13;
constituting the MIS are Microsoft Project, for computerized project management (CPM), Quicken, for&#13;
financial management, and ATLAS-GIS or Map Info, as a desktop GIS package.&#13;
85.          Microsoft Project could be used to facilitate overall project scheduling and detail planning of&#13;
subprojects such as the individual community developments under the social range and scrub forest component.&#13;
One of the attractive features of the software is its facility for relating time scheduling with resource use and&#13;
cost data. A number of Bank-financed projects are now employing the software; their experience will help&#13;
guide the design and use of implementation files for the present project.&#13;
86.          Quicken would standardize financial accounting and facilitate the production of reports organized&#13;
by expenditure class, procurement class, disbursement class, location, or client. The software would provide&#13;
the framework for developing a financial database of actual costs, resource use and disposition of assets.&#13;
87.          The GIS software would permit the storage of maps and the consolidation of various sets of&#13;
information associated with specific physical sites of the project's operation. Not only would the GIS be used&#13;
to document existing site conditions and changes in land characteristics and use under the project, as would be&#13;
required, for example, for the social range and scrub forest component, but it could also record the spatial&#13;
features of a wide range of project implementation activities, such as the introduction of various farm forestry&#13;
husbandry techniques, as well as of the project's impacts on economic, marketing and social conditions. As a&#13;
tool for synthesizing data collected in monitoring, the GIS could be used with the CPM, the financial accounting&#13;
software and possibly other software applications to portray when, where, by whom , for whom, and using what&#13;
resources and techniques project implementation is expected to occur and to compare actual versus planned&#13;
achievements against observed conditions following the completion of the project.&#13;
88.          The detailed specification of the MIS will begin at the time of the project launch and is expected&#13;
to be completed by the time of the first semi-annual review. The project will finance technical assistance to&#13;
design the MIS, install and adapt the software applications, and train project personnel.&#13;
C. Key Performance Indicators&#13;
89.          The remainder of this annex is a listing of possible project implementation and impact indicators&#13;
for use in the MIS. The indicators are not listed in any particular order of priority. The lists are not intended&#13;
be exhaustive accounts nor are all items to be considered necessary; although, strongly recommended items are&#13;

A. Overall Forest Sector&#13;
Human Resources in Punjab Forest Sector&#13;
Objective:         This consultancy aims at the improvement of the institutional set-up in the forestry sector&#13;
of Punjab by concentrating both on public sector institutions and the public at large. In&#13;
particular, a study will produce specific province-wide recommendations concerning: (i)&#13;
redistribution of roles between public sector forestry institutions and the private sector; (ii)&#13;
redefinition of roles within forestry agencies of the public sector; and (iii) required&#13;
governmental actions to support the role of public and private sector institutions involved&#13;
in the forestry sector in an economically efficient way. In addition, the consultants will&#13;
assist PFD in contracting out services for the preparation and mass diffusion of programs&#13;
promoting the conservation of forests and natural vegetation according to the&#13;
guidelines recommended for the implementation of Pakistan's National Conservation&#13;
Strategy (see IUCN: Implementation Design for the NCS of Pakistan January, 1992).&#13;
Study Methodology:&#13;
Sector Obiectives and Present Capacitv: Two working groups will be created in the Punjab&#13;
Forest Department (PFD). Group 1, at management level, will examine sector objectives&#13;
in the light of present and future provincial and national needs related to forestry. This&#13;
will include a review of policies, legal frameworks, responsibilities, comparative&#13;
advantages, linkages, structure and funding. Group I will define the forest sector for the&#13;
future regardless of constraints. Group 2 will concentrate on human resource issues&#13;
including staff numbers, education, training and experience profiles, deployment, job&#13;
descriptions, personnel policies, training opportunities and funding of training. The&#13;
findings of the two working groups would form the basis for a thorough review of human&#13;
resources and the institutional setting in which the human resources operate. The review&#13;
will include PFD, other government institutions and private sector institutions including&#13;
local rural communities.&#13;
Consensus Building Workshops: Series of working level workshops will be held to discuss&#13;
the working groups recommendations and reach provincial consensus (with Federal, NGO,&#13;
and popular participation) on the need for action and a time-table for implementation of&#13;
recommended changes. High level PFD and GOPunjab support to the recommended action&#13;
plan will be sought.&#13;
Duration:         to be initiated at project launching and will extend for a period of 12 months.&#13;

Assistance:         This effort will be led by Punjab P&amp;D and PFD. For the study, hired technical assistance&#13;
will be required to facilitate the process of the two working groups described above by&#13;
assisting in the preparation of status papers to form the basis for the analysis of forest&#13;
sector development and make suggestions for improvement. TA activities will include the&#13;
definition of frameworks for policy and human resources reviews, data collection,&#13;
interviews and analysis to arrive to workable options for consideration at the planned&#13;
workshops. TA will be required to assist in the preparation and execution of the&#13;
workshops. Two consultancies will be needed for this activity, adding to a total&#13;
requirement of 8 man-months. The expertise required is Forest/Natural Resources policy&#13;
and Institutional Analysis/Human Resources Development. For assisting PFD in&#13;
contracting out the mass awareness services, the consultants will advise PFD on terms of&#13;
reference for these services after clearance by IDA and in accordance with the overall&#13;
policy directions pursued in the NCS and in the present project.&#13;

PUNJAB FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
DETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES&#13;
A. Price Contingencies&#13;
1.          The foreign cost component of the project's price contingencies are based on projections, current&#13;
as at May 1994, of changes in the World Bank's Manufactured Unit Value (MUV) index, which is based on&#13;
manufactured exports, expressed in U.S. dollars, from selected industrialized countries to developing countries.&#13;
2.          The projected rates of annual local inflation were provided by the Country Operations, Industry&#13;
and Finance Division, Country Department III (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) of the World Bank, and are&#13;
based on movements in the Consumer Price Index. Given these projections of foreign and domestic inflation,&#13;
movements in the nominal rupee/US$ exchange rate were estimated, assuming that the real effective exchange&#13;
rate remains constant.&#13;
3.          The inflation rates are yearly values within each project year, with project years corresponding to&#13;
fiscal years. Fiscal years start in Pakistan on July 1. The exchange rates used are constant purchasing parity&#13;
rates estimated for project-year midpoints. An exchange rate of Rs 30.0/US$ was applied at the time of data&#13;
collection to convert local and foreign exchange costs, while a rate of Rs 31.2/US$ was used to convert costs up&#13;
to the start of the project. The following table summarizes the parameters used:&#13;

1994/95          13.5              1.5                31.5&#13;
1995/96          9.5               1.8                32.8&#13;
1996/97          6.5               2.6                34.7&#13;
1997/98          6.3               2.5                36.0&#13;

4.          Four months were expected to pass from the time of the collection of data and the negotiation of&#13;
the loan. The Base Costs presented in the Detailed Cost Tables have been adjusted to account for inflation during&#13;
this period, i.e., base costs are values expected to be current for the beginning of December 1994. For domestic&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
costs, this adjustment was approximately 3.3 percent. The adjustment for the foreign exchange components of&#13;
costs was zero. An additional adjustment was made to the price contingency estimates to account for inflation in&#13;
the time between negotiations and the project start up (6 months). For local costs, this additional adjustment was&#13;
4 percent. Again there was no adjustment for foreign costs in this period.&#13;
5.            Cost estimates for incremental government staff are based on revised pay schedules as of June&#13;
1994. They are calculated on the midpoint monthly salary of the basic pay scale range and include allowances&#13;
of 40 percent of the basic pay for housing, travel, etc. Inflation rates of 2 percent within project years were&#13;
applied to these base costs, which reflects the general lag in the cost of living adjustments for civil service&#13;
employees.&#13;
6.            The compounded rates generally applied to base costs (plus physical contingencies) to arrive at&#13;
costs including price contingencies were the following:&#13;
Table 2. Compounded Inflation Weights (%)&#13;
1995/96       1996/97       1997198       1998199       1999/00      2000/01&#13;

Compounded rates of 9 percent and 8.1 percent were used to adjust local costs until the time of negotiations and&#13;
to the project start. The corresponding compounded rates for foreign cost adjustments were zero and 1.3 percent.&#13;
B. Physical Contingencies&#13;
7.            A general rate of 10 percent was applied to base costs for physical contingencies. A rate of 15&#13;
percent was used for most civil and field works. No physical contingencies were calculated for incremental staff&#13;
costs.&#13;

1.          The analysis assumes that it is possible to define aggregated producers' profit, [I , in terms of&#13;
current price, output, the cost of establishing plantings several periods earlier and an additional cost for adjusting&#13;
the size of the growing stock in the current period:&#13;
I=pq,-vI- 2 CJ2&#13;
2&#13;
where p is the present value of fuelwood sold seven years after an initial investment, q, is the&#13;
quantity of wood produced at this time, v is the per unit of growing stock cost of investment, 1, is the investment&#13;
in growing stock measured in physical units and c is the unit cost of adjusting the size of the growing stock. All&#13;
values are to be interpreted in constant terms. Investment and the present value of wood will vary from period&#13;
to period, and so too the value of the profit function.&#13;
2.           Revenues are discounted by a annual rate of r, which the analysis assumes for Punjab to be 10&#13;
percent. The discounted price of fuelwood at a time t is therefore&#13;
Pr=  Pt-6  =pPC I&#13;
where&#13;
w_1&#13;
The supply of wood, q, is a linear production function of the growing stock:&#13;
q,=AK&#13;
where A is the period's productivity parameter and K is the growing stock.&#13;
3.           A change in the growing stock in a period is a result of investment (or disinvestment) and the&#13;
natural deterioration of the growing stock:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
dK=k=X-6K&#13;
Here, 6 is the rate at which the growing stock is naturally decaying.&#13;
4.          The objective of the producer(s) is to maximize profit over all future periods, given the relation&#13;
between investment, decay and the rate of change in the growing stock. That is, to maximize&#13;
fU( t) e-rdt&#13;
0&#13;
such that&#13;
K=I -8K&#13;
The associated Hamiltonian is therefore&#13;
H=e'rM+A (I-6K)&#13;
The variable multiplying the second term in parentheses, X, is the Lagrange multiplier for the&#13;
investment condition. The variables n, x, I and K vary over time.&#13;
5.          From the Euler equation, the conditions of optimality imply that&#13;
I=   Ap   _ v=  ApP  _ v&#13;

Noting that&#13;

k*= A(pP - V_6Kc&#13;
C(-+8)    c&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
This is a differential equation in two of the state variables of interest: the growing stock, K, and&#13;
the price, P.&#13;
6.           In the simulation of the development of the growing stock and the movement of prices with and&#13;
without the project, the cost of investment, v, varies from Rs 1 1.9 per ton of growing stock to Rs 17.7 as the&#13;
seedling subsidy is gradually phased out. This corresponds to an initial seedling price of Rs 2.1 per planting&#13;
without the subsidy. This price includes the cost of replacing failures (20 percent of the seedlings in the first&#13;
year of planting). Other costs initially amount to approximately Rs 2.45 per planting for other inputs and for&#13;
labor employed in planting, maintenance and protection. [This calculation uses a conversion ratio of four&#13;
established trees per ton of growing stock, seven years after planting.] With the project and the development of&#13;
competitive private nurseries, the seedling cost is expected to decline. Other costs per planting are likely to&#13;
increase somewhat as farmers learn to intensify their tree management. Without the project, the subsidization of&#13;
seedlings is expected to continue for period in which the project would be implemented. The investment cost&#13;
without the project is then initially Rs 9.9 per ton of growing stock (farmers continue to pay for all other costs),&#13;
then about Rs 18 when the subsidy discontinues, it is assumed, six years later.&#13;
7.           The productivity parameter, A, like the cost of investment, v, is a short time constant in the&#13;
equation. It may change period to period as an external input to the mechanism that governs the farmers'&#13;
investment decision. Within each period it is treated as a "given". Under the project, the productivity of farm&#13;
plantings is posited to improve by about 25 percent through the application of superior husbandry techniques and&#13;
the use of genetically superior planting material. In the present framework, this is quantified as a change in the&#13;
A from 0.14 to 0.175 tons of wood produced yearly per ton of growing stock. The analysis phases in this&#13;
productivity improvement over a period of 6 years, as the trees established during the project's implementation&#13;
period graduate into the pool of growing stock on farms. Without the project, the productivity parameter&#13;
remains constant at 0.14.&#13;
8.           A second equation in the two state variables is needed to calculate a solution. This is provided by&#13;
having the price adjust to excess demand, that is, to the gap between the quantity of wood provided from the&#13;
farms and the quantity that consumers in the aggregate would purchase at a given price.&#13;
dP=P=t [qd_q,l&#13;
where q, is the quantity demanded and , is the speed at which the price is adjusting to the gap&#13;
between q, and q, in the period. From HESS data, it appears that over the last ten to fifteen years the real price&#13;
of fuelwood has been adjusting very slowly -- less than one percent a year. The analysis reflects this features in&#13;
using a value that would fit these observations and the expected adjustment given the current estimated gap&#13;
between current supply and unconstrained demand.&#13;
9.           The unconstrained demand for wood is found in estimating an aggregated demand schedule. A&#13;
linear relation is assumed:&#13;
P=ao -ald&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
where a,, the slope, is positive. A plot of the schedule produces the expected downward sloping&#13;
demand curve (here a straight line) with the curve intersecting the price axis at a,. The quantity demanded at a&#13;
given price, P, is therefore&#13;
ao-P&#13;
a,&#13;
With population growth, the demand schedule is shifting outward, so from one period to the next&#13;
more wood is demanded at any given price. As long as the slope of the demand schedule remains constant for&#13;
the timeframe of the analysis, the price intercept will move proportionately to the population growth rate. This&#13;
means that given an initial intercept of a, at time 0, the intercept increases at the rate of growth of the&#13;
population. So at time t, the position of the intercept is&#13;
ao =aOinitial eg&#13;
Substituting this relation into the equation above, the price change at time t after a specified initial&#13;
time is given by&#13;
p  p[a.i.iti.le   t-P Kt&#13;
al&#13;
The slope of the schedule is expected to be small to reflect the observed high rate of substitution&#13;
between purchased fuelwood and other fuels.&#13;
10.          With assignments for v, A, c, ao ini.j1 a1, r, and 8, the two-equation differential system in K and P&#13;
can be solved given a starting point for the growing stock and price. The starting point would be selected eight&#13;
years from now, which would be the time, if the project proceeds on schedule, when the trees established during&#13;
the first year of the project join the pool of growing stock from which wood is harvested on a sustainable basis.&#13;
The solutions for K for years 7 to 20 then indicate how many established trees are present in years I to 14. The&#13;
difference in the number of established trees from one period to the next indicates the progression of new&#13;
plantings.&#13;
B. Parameter Assignments&#13;
I.          For the analysis, this initial condition was estimated to be about 21.7 million tons and Rs 1000/t at&#13;
a point seven years from the start of the project (eight years from the present). The initial demand schedule&#13;
intercept at this time was estimated at 4000. The following is a summary of the parameter value assignments&#13;
used for differential system:&#13;

Like Ko and P0, the assignments for the productivity parameter A refer to a starting point eight years from now.&#13;
12.            With these assignments, a Runge-Kutta algorithm  was used to solve numerically the differential&#13;
equations. The results were interpreted to provide indicative projections of the numbers of trees on farms, the&#13;
wood produced and the wood price movement for the next twenty years with and without the project, with and&#13;
without the current policy regime for seedling subsidies. The projections for wood production and it price were&#13;
then used to estimate the year-by-year consumer surplus (deficit) that the alternative imply.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
C. Results&#13;
13.          The simulation implies that without the project, farmers will be planting out between 40 to 50&#13;
million seedlings a year over the first six years. With the project, planting is higher as farmers respond more to&#13;
increases in the productivity of their investments than to the subsidization of seedlings. The wood price does not&#13;
change sharply, but in the with project situation is also lower period by period as compared to without the&#13;
project. This could be explained by noting that the increases in productivity of the growing stock lowers the cost&#13;
of investment for the farmer per unit of output, and so stimulates more investment. Larger supplies of wood&#13;
decrease excess demand and lead to a decrease in the wood price. In comparison, the seedling subsidy has a&#13;
weaker effect in encouraging investment. In general, the behavior of the system appears consistent with&#13;
observations and with short-term expectations of the forest department regarding the take up of seedlings by&#13;
farmers.&#13;
14.          The behavior of the differential system fairly well reflects the stylized facts of recent farm forestry&#13;
plantings and price movements. The analysis does not claim to present a comprehensive set of causal&#13;
relationships that explain investment behavior, but it does demonstrate a logical mechanism that mirrors the&#13;
rationale of the component and offers sufficient, monitorable conditions for affirming a decision to accept the&#13;
project.&#13;
15.          The increased plantings with the project resulting from the solution of the differential system&#13;
mean that there are incremental farm investment costs in aggregate. These were included up to year 14 so that&#13;
corresponding benefits appear within the twenty-year time horizon of the analysis. The analysis also included the&#13;
project costs of forestry extension and research, and recurrent costs that decrease over time. Re-investment in&#13;
stands has been accounted for in the projected development of the standing stock (this was part of the investment&#13;
decision entailing the farmers' optimization of profit for each period).&#13;
16.          Base Rate of Return. Given the solutions of the analysis, given the information available, the base&#13;
financial rate of return to the farm forestry development is estimated at about II percent. If one includes the&#13;
value of the resources saved by the government through the removal of the seedling subsidies as incremental&#13;
resources available to the government for development, the rate of return increases to about 14 percent. The&#13;
base economic internal rate of return, excluding the value of additional resources released to the government in&#13;
phasing out the seedling subsides over the project period is estimated at 14.5 percent. Including the value of&#13;
additional resources to the government, the rate of return is estimated at about 19 percent.&#13;
17.          Alternative assignments for the parameters in the equations are possible, but solutions appear not&#13;
to be stable for wide departures from the values used in the analysis. The analysis concludes that the targets of&#13;
the project have some likelihood of turning out an acceptable economic result in increasing the standing stock of&#13;
trees on farms and in lowering the cost of fuelwood to consumers. Additional environmental benefits and the&#13;
incremental availability of resources for development investments further increase the probability that the rate of&#13;
return of the component would exceed ten percent.&#13;
11. Social Range and Scrub Forests&#13;
A. Analytical Framework&#13;
Productivity and Incomes without the Project&#13;
18.          The villages to be targeted are expected to have grazing areas, including those in scrub forests,&#13;
averaging 300 hectares per community on the Pothwar Plateau and 600 hectares per community in Thai. For the&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
analysis the communities in Pothwar without the project keep on average 750 animals, measured in sheep units&#13;
(SUs) per community, on the given size of total community grazing area, and for Thai communities keep on&#13;
average 1066 animals per community.&#13;
19.         The stocking of animals on the grazing areas breaks down as follows. Of the 300 hectares of&#13;
grazing areas per community for Pothwar, about 225 ha are expected to consist of pastures while 75 ha would&#13;
fall in scrub forests. The perennial forage biomass of the Pothwar pastures is estimated at 300 kg/ha. Scrub&#13;
forest perennial forage biomass is estimated at 500 kg/ha, not all of which is of high digestibility. On average&#13;
three SUs would be stocked per hectare of pasture and one animal would be supported on average in the scrub&#13;
forests. In total, about 675 SUs would be stocked on pastures per community in Pothwar and 75 SUs would be&#13;
grazed in scrub forests. For Thai, perennial forage biomass production is estimated at 200 kg/ha for pastures and&#13;
about 333 kg/ha for forests. Of the average herd of 1066 SUs per community in Thal considered here, about&#13;
1000 SUs would be found on pastures and 66 SUs would use the forests (a total forest area of about 100 ha).&#13;
Present Incomes from Livestock&#13;
20.          From the surveys it has been determined that sales of culls from the herd provide on average Rs&#13;
52.5 per SU. The off take is estimated at 5%. Approximately 0.6 kilograms of wool per SU provide an income&#13;
of Rs 8.2 per SU. Households consume about 1.25 kilograms of meat per SU, which is valued at about Rs&#13;
32.80. The total value of income per SU is therefore estimated at about Rs 94.50. As mentioned above, the&#13;
analysis shows this revenue as slowly declining over the next 20 years to reflect worsening trends in forage&#13;
utilization, animal nutrition and husbandry standards.&#13;
Present Costs of Production&#13;
21.          Present labor requirements, supplied by adults and children, are estimated at 2.43 mandays per SU.&#13;
At a wage of Rs 63/day, the full value of this labor amounts to about Rs 153 per SU.&#13;
Current Net Revenue from Livestock&#13;
22.          With a full costing of the labor employed, the present net revenue from livestock is negative,&#13;
which is consistent with observations of the frequency of women, children and elderly engaged in minding the&#13;
animals. In general, women's time is not valued as highly as men's, and where possible, many men avoid&#13;
working with the livestock and seek employment outside the village.&#13;
Productivity and Incomes with the Project&#13;
Sources of Benefits&#13;
23.          Under the project total perennial forage biomass would increase, first of all, on improved pastures&#13;
and then on unimproved areas following changes in the management of grazing. For Pothwar the production&#13;
from improved pastures (75 ha per community on average) is estimated to reach about 2.4 t/ha. Perennial forage&#13;
biomass for unimproved pastures (150 ha) and for treated scrub forests (75 ha) would rise to about 600 kg/ha&#13;
and 1000 kg/ha, respectively. Stocking on improved pastures could increase to about 4 SU/ha, while 2 SU/ha&#13;
would be stocked in the unimproved pastures and in the treated scrub forests. With these stocking rates, the total&#13;
number of animals stocked would match the number held without the project. Adding in some incremental&#13;
forage production on farms, total perennial forage biomass would increase, indicatively, from about 105 tons for&#13;
the total grazing area without the project to about 405 tons with the project. For Thal perennial forage biomass&#13;
would increase from 200 kg/ha to 1.5 t/ha on improved pastures (250 ha) and from 200 kg/ha to 400 kg/ha on&#13;
unimproved pastures (250 ha) following changes in the management of grazing. In improved scrub forests (100&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
ha) perennial forage biomass is expected to increase from about 333 kg/ha to about 600 kg/ha. Total forage&#13;
biomass per community in Thal would therefore improve from about 133 t without the project to approximately&#13;
541 t with the project. Stocking on improved pastures would increase from 2 SU/ha to 2.5 SU/ha. Stocking on&#13;
the unimproved pastures and improved scrub forest areas would increase from about 0.66 SU/ha to 1.33 SU/ha.&#13;
24.          The changes in grazing management would likely include the closure of some areas at the start,&#13;
and some destocking might be required. This is reflected in the analysis and represents an increase in&#13;
incremental costs with the project in the form of foregone income. In the medium term, however, animal&#13;
populations with the project are allowed to be at least as high as current estimates.&#13;
25.          In addition to the income from livestock, villages should also profit from the incremental&#13;
production of wood from afforested scrub forest areas. The scrub forest improvements under the project are&#13;
expected to add an average of 370 trees per hectare. Roughly thirty of these trees per hectare could be harvested&#13;
each year and replanted, stalting after ten years, to sustain an incremental supply of about 1000 tons of fuelwood&#13;
for the village. The average yield per tree is expected to be 1.85 maunds (74 kg). The income from this harvest&#13;
was valued at Rs 25 per maund (or Rs 0.66 per kilogram at the farmgate).&#13;
Incomes from Livestock with the Project&#13;
26.          With the improved availability of forage and nutrition under the project, it is expected that culled&#13;
animals could achieve a 20 percent increase in weight and that the offtake can increase to 25 percent. These&#13;
changes alone would increase the value of income from the herd by about Rs 236 per SU over five years, and&#13;
this increment should be realized as cash. The analysis has ignored increases in marketed wool and quantities of&#13;
meat consumed by households.&#13;
Net Revenue with the Project&#13;
27.          Five years after the investment, if works are completed in one season, villages are expected to&#13;
earn incremental income of about Rs 103,880 (US$ 3,351) in Pothwar and Rs 134,370 (US$4,334) in Thai from&#13;
their livestock, which would amount to an increase of about Rs 138 (US$ 5.5) per SU in Pothwar and Rs 123&#13;
(US$4) per SU in Thai. The value of incremental wood produced from the afforested areas would eventually&#13;
bring the community's incremental net income to approximately Rs 211,480 (US$6,822) in Pothwar and to about&#13;
Rs 244,270 (US$7,880) in Thai. Assuming an average of 200 households per community, incremental net&#13;
income would then amount to about US$34 per household in Pothwar and about US$39 per household in Thal&#13;
(see Appendix 1, first pages of Tables 4 and 6). If for rural households in these area per capita income is&#13;
estimated at half the national average of US$400, the project impact calculated here would represent an increase&#13;
in household incomes of less than 20 percent: the scale of calculated incremental net benefits considered here,&#13;
given the level of investments envisioned for the component, would probably not be an unreasonably high&#13;
expectation.&#13;
B. Results&#13;
28.          Project financial internal rates of return (IRRs) were estimated for the developments involving 68&#13;
communities in Pothwar and 32 communities in Thal. Part of project costs for community extension, including&#13;
the purchase and operation of heavy equipment, vehicles, the construction of staff offices and housing, equipment&#13;
and tools, technical assistance, training, incremental staff salaries and other overhead expenses were apportioned&#13;
to the two areas. Residual values for heavy equipment, vehicles and office equipment partially offset incremental&#13;
project costs at the end of the project's implementation period. For the Pothwar development the financial&#13;
internal rate of return was estimated at approximately 17 percent. For Thal, the IRR was estimated to be 15&#13;
- 111 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
percent. The rate of return of the component as a whole is estimated at 16 percent (the calculation is displayed&#13;
in Appendix 1, Table 8). This result is not very sensitive to small variations in the benefit or cost streams.&#13;
29.          For the economic analysis livestock revenue was converted into its economic value using a&#13;
conversion factor of 0.60, which was derived from a calculation of the average import parity value of mutton&#13;
produced in barani areas in central Punjab. Using economic values for inputs, outputs and project costs, the&#13;
economic intemal rate of return (ERR) for Pothwar was estimated at 15 percent and for Thai at 11 percent. The&#13;
rate of return for the component in aggregate amounts to about 12 percent. See Appendix I, Tables 4 and 6 for&#13;
the calculations of the economic budgets of grazing and husbandry development in Pothwar and Thai. Annex 6,&#13;
Appendix 1, Table 7 presents the calculation of the analysis.&#13;

1/ The landed cost of pulp at Karachi over the last x years has declined&#13;
to about $400/t from $900/t in step with cyclic trends in the world market.&#13;
The present price of kraft wood pulp of about $400 -$450/t is thought&#13;
to mark the trough of the current cycle. The cif cost used here is an estimate&#13;
of the minimum average cost of imported pulp required over the project period.&#13;
The feasibility of this import price must be matched against the expectations of&#13;
North and South American pulp industry export price projections.&#13;
2/ Estimated at Rs 0.41/tUkm for approximately 1200 km.&#13;
3/ Estimated at approximately $550/t pulp including capital charges&#13;
and an operating margin of $100/t to obtain a minimum return on a 100-150 TPD&#13;
plant investment (employing used European equipment) of $20 million.&#13;

            The Punjab Forest Sector Development
            Project will promote sustainable land use in rural areas of
            Punjab by redirecting public sector involvement towards the
            expansion of agro-forestry production systems and the
            rehabilitation of degraded range and scrub land. The project
            will inter alia support the following components: (a)
            institutional development; (b) farm forestry expansion; and
            (c) social range and scrub forest rehabilitation.
