skills of children in Target Regions and Target Schools, with a special focus on those belonging to&#13;
Target Disadvantaged Groups.&#13;
1.   The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and of the&#13;
purpose to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.   The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the proceeds of&#13;
such additional loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in Article I&#13;
of said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the development of the&#13;
productive facilities and resources of the Borrower and is in the interest of the Borrower and of the&#13;
members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
