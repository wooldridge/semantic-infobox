The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of&#13;

$48,000,000, which loan is to be guaranteed by the Federative Republic of Brazil. The purpose&#13;
of said loan is to support the Borrower to improve service delivery through introducing&#13;
performance-based management information technologies and an integrated territorial&#13;
development approach in key public services.&#13;

proceeds of such loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in&#13;
Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said Project is designed to promote the&#13;
development of the productive facilities and resources of the Federative Republic of Brazil and is&#13;
in the interest of the Federative Republic of Brazil and of the members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
