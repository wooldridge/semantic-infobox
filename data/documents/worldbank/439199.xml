COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Mexico is unique in that between 70 and 80 percent of its 55 million hectares of&#13;
forest are under communal ownership by 8,000 forest ejidos and indigenous communities.&#13;
This unusually extensive communal ownership of Mexico's forests poses important&#13;
challenges for the sustainable development and conservation of forestry resources. The&#13;
Government has taken steps in the last five years to remove distortions in the policy&#13;
framework that were negatively affecting the forestry sector, and to put in place&#13;
streamlined institutional mechanisms to support the development of the sector.&#13;
FORESTRY RESOURCES&#13;
1.2   Forests and wildlands cover 72 percent of Mexico's territory. Forests in Mexico&#13;
fall into the following major categories: temperate coniferous and broadleafed; tropical&#13;
evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous; arid and semiarid; and wetlands. The temperate&#13;
and tropical forests cover 55 million hectares, or 25 percent of Mexico's territory. Sixty&#13;
percent (31.8 million hectares) are classified as temperate, of which two-thirds are mixed&#13;
coniferous forests, and the rest broadleafed or cloud forests. The mixed coniferous forests&#13;
are distributed along the most important mountain ranges of the Sierra Madre Oriental,&#13;
Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre del Sur, and Eje Neovolcanico, and are mainly&#13;
concentrated in the states of Chihuahua, Durango, Michoacan, Jalisco, Guerrero, and&#13;
Oaxaca.&#13;
1.3   Tropical forests include tropical evergreen and serni-evergreen forests (5.8 million&#13;
hectares), of which eighty percent are located in the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Oaxaca,&#13;
Quintana Roo, and Veracruz. Tropical deciduous forests (11 million hectares) occur&#13;
mainly in the coastal plains of the Pacific Coast, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and the north&#13;
of the Yucatan Peninsula. There are also small areas of mangrove stands scattered along&#13;
the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Coasts. Arid and semiarid areas are scattered&#13;
throughout the northern and central states.&#13;
1.4   Based on slope, quality of resource and legal zoning status, 21 million hectares of&#13;
forest have been identified as having potential for sustainable productive use for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
commercial timber. Of this total, only 7 million hectares are under management. These&#13;
forests and wildlands hold an extraordinary richness of flora and fauna in diverse&#13;
ecosystems over a wide range of altitudes and rainfall patterns.&#13;
1.5    Over the past five decades, wildlands have declined considerably. Traditional&#13;
systems of shifting cultivation, which in some cases are unsustainable, can be the basis of&#13;
long term management. However, there is clear evidence that the continued deforestation,&#13;
estimated recently at 620,000 to 680,000 hectares per year, is resulting in conversion of&#13;
forest lands to less productive uses with negative environmental externalities. As&#13;
documented in the Mexico Resource Conservation and Forestry Sector Review (Grey&#13;
Cover Report No. 13114-ME, March 31, 1995), the resource base is also underutilized&#13;
and degraded.&#13;
1.6   Environmental and social values and the commercial potential of non-traditional&#13;
products have been largely ignored, even though these combined values greatly exceed&#13;
timber and alternative use values alone. Data is available on the production of traditionally&#13;
traded non-timber and non-traditional forest products (NTFPs), such as chicle,&#13;
mushrooms, resin, orchids, asparagus, edible palms, peppers, gladioli bulbs, yuca, nopal,&#13;
oregano, heno, nogal, honey and oak products, but data is not available on non-traditional&#13;
NTFPs. Examples of these include traditional medicines, herbs, edible fruits and seeds,&#13;
flavorings, fibers, dyes, essences, fragrances, and insects. The recorded production of&#13;
NTFPs is highest in the temperate forests (38,000 tons per annum), followed by output in&#13;
the arid/semiarid formations (17,500 tons per annum), and the tropical moist formations&#13;
(12,800 tons per annum).&#13;
1.7   The state of Oaxaca covers 9.5 million hectares (4.8 percent of national territory)&#13;
in southern Mexico and is bordered by the states of Veracruz and Puebla to the north-&#13;
northeast, Chiapas to the east, Guerrero to the west, and the Pacific Ocean to the south.&#13;
Two of Mexico's principal mountain ranges, the Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre&#13;
Oriental, meet in Oaxaca, creating a unique geography of temperate mountain terrain&#13;
juxtaposed with tropical vegetation as well as more temperate coastlands. Oaxaca' s&#13;
vegetation ranges from desert brush to temperate pines, to humid jungle and mangroves.&#13;
1.8   Forests and other natural vegetation cover 7.1 million hectares of Oaxaca (74&#13;
percent of state territory). About five million hectares (72 percent of state forest cover)&#13;
are made up of temperate and tropical forests, which represent 9 percent of the national&#13;
forest cover, and makes Oaxaca the state with the third highest quantity of forests.&#13;
Temperate forests, primarily pine and oak, cover 2.7 million hectares of Oaxaca and&#13;
represent 53 percent of state forest cover. Tropical forests cover 2.4 million hectares,&#13;
representing 47 percent of state forest cover. In addition, Oaxaca has 28,000 hectares of&#13;
arid brush and related cover, and 2,300 hectares of wetlands. The state has 1.9 million&#13;
hectares (27 percent of state forest cover) of degraded forest, which includes semi-&#13;
forested areas encroached upon by farming, grazing, timber extraction, and forest fires.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.9   Besides Oaxaca, the other five priority states with pine-oak forests are Chihuahua,&#13;
Durango, Jalisco, Michoacan, and Guerrero. These five states comprise about 57 rnillion&#13;
hectares (29 percent of Mexico's land area) and have extensive pine-oak and other forest&#13;
resources. The combined area of temperate (mostly pine-oak) forest in these five states is&#13;
about 17.5 million hectares (31 percent of these states' land area). Chihuahua has the&#13;
most extensive temperate forests (about 7 million hectares), followed by Durango (about 5&#13;
million hectares), Jalisco and Guerrero (about 2 million hectares each), and Michoacan&#13;
(1.5 million hectares). These five states also contain approximately 4.8 million hectares of&#13;
tropical dry and moist forests, as well as about 12.7 nillion hectares of other natural&#13;
ecosystems (including grasslands, deserts, and wetlands). Taken together, natural&#13;
ecosystems (excluding converted or highly degraded areas) still cover approximately 69&#13;
percent of Durango; 68 percent of Chihuahua; 55 percent of Guerrero; 48 percent of&#13;
Michoacan; and 44 percent of Jalisco.&#13;
COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT OF FORESTRY RESOURCES&#13;
1.10  Article 27 of the 1917 Constitution defines three basic categories of land rights:&#13;
ejido, communal property, and small private property. Ejidos constitute a land grant for&#13;
usufruct to a population group, and until the constitutional reforms of 1992, ejido land&#13;
essentially belonged to the state and could not be sold. Communal property is based on&#13;
the historical rights of pre-Hispanic indigenous communities who have maintained their&#13;
traditional communal property structure. Small private property is privately owned and is&#13;
subject to size limits according to the quality of the land and type of crop or economic&#13;
activity.&#13;
1.11  Over 8,000 communities and ejidos throughout the country have forestry resources&#13;
within their boundaries, and about 5,000 of these exploit their forests commercially. Other&#13;
communities and ejidos use their forests as a source of fuelwood, medicinal plants,&#13;
foodstuffs, household construction materials and utensils, and frames and posts for&#13;
agricultural use. Forests have an important present and potential role to play for these&#13;
communities and ejidos: (a) commercially as a source of timber and non-timber products&#13;
for domestic consumption or export; (b) as the source of a range of subsistence and&#13;
informally-marketed products; (c) as religious and cultural sacred sites of the different&#13;
indigenous, ethnic groups in forested areas; and (d) as a resource base for tourism and&#13;
recreational enterprises benefiting these communities and ejidos.&#13;
1.12 Communities have been given more recognition as legitimate local governments.&#13;
Some communities have begun to prepare communal statutes that formalize customary&#13;
law agreements regarding political organization, social values, land boundaries and tenure,&#13;
natural resource management, and identification of sacred sites. These statutes could&#13;
serve as a vehicle for formally recording aspects of the forest management plans relevant&#13;
to cultural values. Most commercial resource allocation decisions revolve around timber&#13;
extraction. A few communities are involved seasonally in the lucrative white mushroom&#13;
trade, but other foodstuffs and medicinal plants are at present low volume, low market&#13;
value products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.13  Of the 1,300 to 1,500 communities and ejidos in Oaxaca, an estimated 40 percent&#13;
have temperate forest holding within their boundaries, and 228 communities and eight&#13;
ejidos have significant pine-oak forest areas within their boundaries large enough to&#13;
warrant commercial exploitation (ranging from 500 to 20,000 hectares and averaging&#13;
about 5,000 hectares per community).&#13;
1.14  There is strong ethnic and cultural diversity among the 236 communities and ejidos&#13;
with pine-oak forest in Oaxaca, which come from six of Oaxaca's 16 ethnicities, namely&#13;
the Zapoteca, Mixteca, Nahuatl, Cuicateco, Chinanteca, and Mixe. Some of the common&#13;
characteristics of these communities and ejidos include: (a) strong cultural values&#13;
regarding forest resources; (b) strong values for allocating a share of forest profits to&#13;
social goods and employment; (c) existence of sacred sites within communal forest areas;&#13;
(d) preference for employing community members as technical forest advisors to ensure&#13;
cultural values are reflected in forest management; and (e) an independent social and&#13;
cultural identity of individual communities vis-a-vis other communities, even those of the&#13;
same general ethnic group. There is wide variation in the extent to which a broad group&#13;
of community and ejido members participate in forestry decisions. Women, in general, do&#13;
not participate in the forestry sector, although they are involved in fuelwood and non-&#13;
timber product collection. Only in the more diversified forestry enterprises have women&#13;
found roles in accounting and administrative duties. Some of the more developed&#13;
enterprises employ community members as technical forest advisors.&#13;
1.15  Of these 236 communities and ejidos with significant pine-oak forest areas within&#13;
their boundaries, 114 manage 550,000 hectares of pine-oak forests (only 20 percent of the&#13;
state's total pine-oak forests) and have management plans, with 41 selling standing timber,&#13;
43 harvesting timber, and 30 harvesting and processing timber in their own mills. Ten&#13;
communities are organized into inter-community unions with integrated forest enterprises.&#13;
The other communities and ejidos have important forestry resources, but do not manage&#13;
any commercial timber extraction.&#13;
1.16  Oaxaca is one of the poorest states in Mexico, with annual per capita income of 40&#13;
percent of the national average, and in Oaxaca the indigenous communities are among the&#13;
poorest. Land and agricultural policies, combined with high poverty levels in the&#13;
communities and ejidos of Oaxaca exert strong pressure to expand agricultural production&#13;
to forested areas. At the same time, the high levels of out-migration in search ofjobs has&#13;
reduced the pressure on the resource base, and has resulted in some agricultural areas&#13;
remaining fallow. On balance, the rate of deforestation in Oaxaca seems to be decreasing.&#13;
1.17  In the pine-oak forests of Oaxaca, the timber stand in 1994 represented 135.6&#13;
million cubic meters, with an annual increment of 1.9 million cubic meters. In that year&#13;
cutting permits were authorized for 1.1 million cubic meters, with actual extraction of 0.4&#13;
million cubic meters. This extraction is only 23 percent of the annual increment, 38&#13;
percent of the authorized cut, and about two-thirds of the processing capacity in the state.&#13;
Clearly there is vast potential for increased sustainable timber extraction in Oaxaca.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.18  Access by communities to information and technical assistance on forestry issues is&#13;
limited. In recent years, most government-financed technical assistance for forestry has&#13;
been privatized. Many of the government employees have fulfilled the education and&#13;
experience requirements to work as private providers of forestry services, and have&#13;
registered in the national forestry registry, the Registro Nacional Forestal. These private&#13;
providers provide a range of forestry services, including the preparation of forestry&#13;
management plans, annual cutting plans, and tree markings. There are at present no&#13;
registration requirements for the provision of other technical services to forest resource&#13;
owners, such as forest product processing, accounting, marketing, and environmental&#13;
assessments.&#13;
1.19 About half of the pine-oak area under management in Oaxaca has benefited from&#13;
the assistance of 6 companies and 17 individuals registered as private providers of forestry&#13;
services, as well as unregistered private providers of non-forestry services and community&#13;
forestry specialists. Private providers have traditionally been paid as a percentage of the&#13;
extracted timber, and communities indicate that their use of private provider services is&#13;
limited by the number of private providers, and the range of services they provide, rather&#13;
than by cash flow constraints. While some of the private providers are able to provide&#13;
high quality advisory services, their skills need substantial upgrading, and their services&#13;
need closer monitoring by the communities and forestry institutions.&#13;
1.20  There is strong potential for communities and ejidos to improve their market niche.&#13;
Markets for wood for the construction industry have been restricted due to the economic&#13;
downturn starting in December 1994, although the devaluation of the peso has given&#13;
Mexican wood a price advantage over imported wood. The limited access of communities&#13;
and ejidos to diverse markets is related to a number of factors: the high cost of transport&#13;
due to lack of road infrastructure; the inability of forestry enterprises to supply wood of a&#13;
given quality and quantity on a timely basis; the lack of working capital for harvesting and&#13;
processing; and the lack of technical knowledge. Most communities are selling high&#13;
quality pine into an undifferentiated market, even though there is strong domestic and&#13;
international demand for higher value products. Cash flow for harvesters is also uncertain,&#13;
since many of the smaller processing industries that buy wood from communities have&#13;
their own marketing problems and are often unable to pay on time.&#13;
POLICY FRAMEWORK&#13;
Land Tenure and Agricultural Policies&#13;
1.21  Land tenure policies have generally had a negative impact on the forests in&#13;
Mexico. The process for allocating land and resource rights has had far-reaching&#13;
implications for efficiency in land and resource management. Parceling gave the ejido&#13;
member exclusive use of an area of land. However, in order to maintain the right to use&#13;
the land, the ejidatario had to work his land. Legally, the ejidatario could not rent, lease,&#13;
or sell his land nor hire others to work it. In practice, informal land markets existed in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
many ejidos but ejido land is undervalued relative to private holdings. In Oaxaca, where&#13;
there is a high concentration of indigenous communities and only a few forestry ejidos, the&#13;
incentive to clear forest to create parcels has been lower.&#13;
1.22 The Agrarian Reform of 1934, which operationalized Article 27 of the&#13;
Constitution, promoted the occupation and clearing of forest lands. By legally focusing on&#13;
agricultural parcels, it ignored forest lands, thus giving open access to those who could in&#13;
fact convert land to an agricultural or livestock use, a precondition for obtaining a parcel.&#13;
This, combined with the forest concession policies, was a main force underlying the high&#13;
deforestation rates that started in the 1940s, while preventing the privatization of forests.&#13;
The Constitutional Reform of 1947 also followed this pattern. For example, forest lands&#13;
were not included in the complex system of land distribution and demarcation, and the&#13;
overall result of the lack of policies on forest preservation was a run on forested lands and&#13;
the advance of the agricultural frontier.&#13;
1.23  Oaxacan forests were seriously affected by the Agrarian Reform of 1934 and the&#13;
Constitutional Reform of 1947, where land that was either indigenous or nominally state-&#13;
owned was claimed as private land. Such land claims were most common in broadleaf&#13;
forests, but also occurred in pine-oak forests. Because these laws focused exclusively on&#13;
agricultural land, rural residents were encouraged to convert land to agricultural or&#13;
livestock use to establish recognizable claims.&#13;
1.24  Rapid growth in the agricultural sector in the late 1940s through the mid-1960s&#13;
encouraged forest conversion. During this time the agricultural sector grew more than 4&#13;
percent a year, outstripping population growth and surpassing any other Latin American&#13;
country. By 1965, most of the better quality land was under cultivation and productivity&#13;
per hectare showed no further improvement. The cumulative result was that between&#13;
1965 and 1980, agricultural Gross Domestic Product grew only at 2.4 percent per year,&#13;
slower than population growth. Demand for grains surpassed production capacity and&#13;
Mexico became a net importer of grains. The livestock sector expanded mainly between&#13;
1972 and 1985. The number of beef cattle grew by 15 percent, matching growth in&#13;
consumption which was 16 percent. The area devoted to fodder production also increased&#13;
by more than 100 percent between 1970 and 1985.&#13;
1.25  Direct and indirect subsidies to stimulate production included direct investment in&#13;
the agriculture and livestock sector, producer subsidies, and promotion of production&#13;
activities through parastatals. An extensive network of subsidies developed supporting:&#13;
fertilizers, pesticides, fuel, electricity, credit, water, seeds, and crop insurance. The Farm&#13;
Support Payments Program (Programa de Apoyos Directos al Campo; PROCAMPO) was&#13;
initiated in 1994 to assist farmers to move to more profitable land uses by channeling a&#13;
limited-term payment on a parcel basis to farmers formerly qualifying for crop subsidies.&#13;
In states like Oaxaca, however, where records are imperfect, farmers had incentives to&#13;
clear new parcels, some in forested areas, in order to become eligible for limited-term&#13;
payments on these parcels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
1.26  The reform of Article 27 of the Constitution in 1992 introduced fundamental&#13;
changes in land rights: land redistribution was eliminated, transactions of ejido lands were&#13;
authorized, ejido farmers were given the right to sell their lands, and agrarian courts were&#13;
created to solve land claim conflicts. With the new law, an ejido can decide to distribute&#13;
agricultural land parcels to its members under full private ownership or to continue with&#13;
the present system. However, in common-use lands, where most of the forests are found,&#13;
land cannot be parceled or sold. An explicit objective of the reform is to create a climate&#13;
for more sustainable common resource management, encouraging ejido members to&#13;
rationalize forest management and use. Under the reform, they are also encouraged to&#13;
seek joint ventures with private investors, with the certainty that their rights over the&#13;
common-use lands are secure. This lays the groundwork to avoid the open access&#13;
problems of the past.&#13;
Forestry Policies&#13;
1.27  Forestry policies have attempted to exert a countervailing force to land reform and&#13;
agricultural and economic policies, with partial success. Mexico has had forestry&#13;
legislation since 1884, but in practice this has often been overridden by other policies.&#13;
Most of the legislation has been heavy on regulation and de facto control, limiting the&#13;
users' decision making power over the resource. Regulations imposed costs on forest&#13;
users and added to the incentives for conversion of forests to agricultural land.&#13;
1.28  The 1884 Regulations were oriented mainly to the regulation of levels of&#13;
commercial harvesting, with the objective of sustaining yields through a complex system&#13;
of land classification and use regulations. In the late 1800s, concessions were opened to&#13;
large (primarily U.S.) lumber firms, mostly in the northern areas of Mexico's pine-oak&#13;
forests. At the turn of the century and just before the Mexican Revolution, these firms&#13;
were expropriated and their mills turned over to national owners, who since then have&#13;
generally faced problems due to lack of sufficient timber supply and inefficient&#13;
administration. One legacy of this period is the continued location of most timber&#13;
processing plants away from the resource, near centers of consumption. In part, this was&#13;
the result of the extensiveness of extraction (once one source of supply was logged out,&#13;
the industry shifted extraction to another more distant location) and the desire to avoid&#13;
labor problems associated with drawing upon the same labor pool for extraction and&#13;
processing. Now that industry supplies are more limited than before, the transport costs&#13;
for the processing centers in the north are quite high relative to the available source of raw&#13;
material. In Oaxaca, with the exception of some remote communities in the southern part&#13;
of the state, distances from communities to potential buyers are much shorter, and high&#13;
costs are related to inefficiencies in harvesting, processing and transport.&#13;
1.29  After the 1910 revolution, the forests of Mexico were largely transferred to ejidos&#13;
and indigenous communities, although the process was slow and continued well into the&#13;
1970s. In 1926, the first Forest Law was introduced with a focus on conservation. This&#13;
law was progressively conservationist for its time, but was largely neutralized by the land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
reform that channeled public resources toward crop and livestock production and favored&#13;
land allocation to those without forest cover or standing trees on their holdings.&#13;
1.30  The legal passing of actual control of the forest resources to the ejidos and&#13;
communities was only possible with the 1942 Forestry Law, and even then government&#13;
control and interference continued to be heavy, including the establishment of parastatals&#13;
that essentially had monopoly power over management and harvesting of the forests.&#13;
Large haciendas and their forests were expropriated and, while ownership rights were&#13;
legally retained by the federal government, usufruct rights to the trees and land resource&#13;
were turned over to ejidos and communities. At the same time, private forest products&#13;
manufacturing firms were prohibited from owning forest lands, which effectively left them&#13;
dependent on ejido and community suppliers, as well as the small private landowners. The&#13;
main parastatal established during this period in Oaxaca was the Fabricas de Papel&#13;
Tuxtepec (FAPATUX), a pulp factory.&#13;
1.31  The 1986 Forestry Law introduced much greater environmental regulation within&#13;
the context of the management plans, and gave the Government a stronger role in plan&#13;
approval and monitoring. The 1986 Forestry Law continued the spirit of heavy state&#13;
intervention initiated in the 1942 Forestry Law through management plans, and cutting,&#13;
transport, processing, and selling permits. This intervention was justified by the view that,&#13;
left to their own, communities would not be able to manage their forests in the public&#13;
interest. The law also restricted any change of land use in fragile lands or public forests&#13;
and reserves. The 1986 Forestry Law did not include technical norms in its regulations,&#13;
which helped create a high level of insecurity among forest resource owners regarding&#13;
their legal rights.&#13;
1.32  The policies related to forestry deprived the private sector of a resource base and&#13;
created a three way split of the sector: the communities and ejidos held most utilization&#13;
rights to the resource; the public sector maintained control of the resource and hence had&#13;
the power to legislate and, theoretically at least, to regulate the management of the&#13;
resource and administration of the sector as a whole; and the private sector housed most&#13;
of the industry. This arrangement, coupled with poorly implemented intervention by&#13;
government regulatory agencies, virtually guaranteed the conflict and distrust that&#13;
effectively crippled the sector and still limits relations today. It placed most of the&#13;
country's forest resources in the hands of poor, unskilled farmers, but failed to provide the&#13;
needed resources for proper management. In Oaxaca, the main communities supplying&#13;
FAPATUX effectively blocked renewal of the concession to this parastatal. This fight&#13;
gave them political will for some to form their own processing unions.&#13;
1.33  Mexico passed a new Forestry Law in 1992 and the implementing regulations were&#13;
issued in 1994. This was a sweeping revision of previous legislation and had as its main&#13;
objectives the transformation of government forestry agencies from executors and direct&#13;
interventionists into more normative organizations. As such, the new law eliminated many&#13;
executive responsibilities and allowed for decentralization to state level agencies. The&#13;
major change was the transfer of forest management, conservation, protection and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
improvement responsibilities to the forest land owners and producers, leaving the&#13;
Government with a normative and supervisory role. Federal agencies would no longer&#13;
provide direct technical assistance services to the forest owners and producers, or be&#13;
directly involved in the transportation, warehousing or manufacturing of forest products.&#13;
As part of these legal changes, the Government sold off any remaining parastatal forest&#13;
products firms.&#13;
1.34 In March 1996, Mexican President Zedillo announced the Forestry Program for&#13;
1995 to 2000, with the dual objectives of conservation and protection of forestry&#13;
resources, and the increase of forestry's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product. The&#13;
conservation and protection program includes: prevention of forest fires; disease&#13;
prevention and control; technical assistance to forestry communities; special plantations&#13;
and production of charcoal; increased inspection; and decentralized permitting procedures.&#13;
The program to increase productivity includes: the establishment of a Fund to provide&#13;
seed money for road building, payments to private providers of forestry services,&#13;
integrated production, and diversified use of the forestry resources including non-timber&#13;
products, and restoration of critical areas; credit and financing programs with different&#13;
government institutions, development banks, and agencies, to stimulate the sector; training&#13;
and technical assistance for communities and industries; and development of a market&#13;
information system.&#13;
FORESTRY INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.35  As part of the consolidation of environmental activities under the Zedillo&#13;
administration, responsibility for forestry activities was shifted from the Secretariat of&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development (Secretaria de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural;&#13;
SAGAR) to the Secretariat of Environment, Natural Resources, and Fisheries (Secretaria&#13;
de Medio Ambiente, Recursos Naturales y Pesca; SEMARNAP). Within SEMARNAP,&#13;
several agencies have responsibility for forestry related activities. The Forestry&#13;
Department (Direccion General Forestal; DGF) within the Sub-Secretariat of Natural&#13;
Resources has primary responsibility for forest utilization and management, forest&#13;
protection, forest development, and commercial reforestation. The Forest Utilization&#13;
Division within DGF (Direccion de Aprovechaniiento Forestal; DAF), is in charge of&#13;
forest utilization and management. The National Forestry Council (Consejo Tecnico&#13;
Consultivo Nacional Forestal; CONAF) serves as the interface between the Government,&#13;
private sector, academics, and non-governmental organizations. The Tropical Forestry&#13;
Action Plan Program (Programa de Accion Forestal Tropical; PROAFT) funds activities in&#13;
tropical forests. The Department of Soil Conservation and Restoration (Direccion&#13;
General de Conservacion y Restauracion de Suelos) carries out land use planning activities&#13;
that include forested areas and watersheds. The Sub-Secretariat of Planning assists the&#13;
Sub-Secretariat of Natural Resources with forestry policies and plans.&#13;

1.36 SEMARNAP also has three autonomous agencies that are involved in the forestry&#13;
sector. The National Ecology Institute (Instituto Nacional de Ecologia; INE) is&#13;
responsible for the review and approval of the environmental impact aspects of forestry&#13;
management programs for both commercial forests and natural protected areas, an activity&#13;
which is carried out by the agency at state level. The Environmental Protection Agency&#13;
(Procuraduria Federal de Proteccion al Ambiente; PFPA) is responsible for enforcing&#13;
compliance with the forestry management plans, an activity which is carried out by the&#13;
agency at state level, and audited at the federal level. The National Biodiversity&#13;
Commission (Comision Nacional de Aprovechamiento de la Biodiversidad; CONABIO) is&#13;
responsible for biodiversity uses and products.&#13;
1.37 In line with other Government Secretariats, SEMARNAP is planning the general&#13;
deconcentration and decentralization of its activities. The current stage is the&#13;
strengthening of the state level institutions and the deconcentration of activities and&#13;
resources from SEMARNAP in Mexico City to the SEMARNAP state delegations. This&#13;
has already been completed for forestry activities. The next stage is the decentralization of&#13;
activities and resources from the SEMARNAP state delegations to the agencies of the&#13;
state governments. The final stage is the merging of the resources and responsibilities of&#13;
the SEMARNAP state delegations and the agencies of the state governments. Progress&#13;
will not be uniform, but will depend on the capacity of each state. SEMARNAP expects&#13;
to complete the first two stages in Oaxaca during the life of the project.&#13;
1.38  The different agencies within SEMARNAP have been given full responsibility for&#13;
the forestry sector, but while these new agencies have large mandates, they are uniformly&#13;
understaffed and underfunded. Institutional strengthening of the federal institutions within&#13;
the sector is imperative. While coordination is theoretically easier than it was when the&#13;
agencies were spread across different ministries, better coordination within SEMARNAP&#13;
is now necessary.&#13;
1.39  At the state level, the activities and partial resources of the former Sub-Delegation&#13;
of Forestry in SAGAR have been transferred to the SEMARNAP delegations within each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
state. In the case of Oaxaca, the mandate of the former Sub-Delegation of Forestry has&#13;
been expanded to include all natural resources, but the human and financial resources were&#13;
not transferred from SAGAR and their lack is a constraint to the proper functioning of the&#13;
Sub-Delegation. SEMARNAP Oaxaca also includes the Sub-Delegation of Planning&#13;
which is in charge of all training, and the Sub-Delegation of Environment, which is related&#13;
to INE and is charged with the environmental review of forestry management plans.&#13;
PFPA has its own Delegation in Oaxaca.&#13;

1.40  The State Secretariat for the Development of Agriculture and Forestry (Secretaria&#13;
de Desarrollo Agropecuario y Forestal; SEDAF) is the state agency in Oaxaca involved in&#13;
forestry activities, and focuses primarily on reforestation. SEMARNAP Oaxaca, which&#13;
includes the INE and PFPA delegations, and SEDAF, are weak institutions. While&#13;
extremely capable, the handful of senior people who work in these institutions need&#13;
support from technicians and administrators, and more resources to carry out their&#13;
mandates.&#13;
WORLD BANK ACTIVITIES&#13;
1.41  The Government and the Bank have had a long involvement in the forestry sector&#13;
and agree that for poverty and environmental reasons the forestry sector in Mexico cannot&#13;
be ignored, and must be supported.&#13;
1.42 Between 1989 and 1993, the Bank financed the Mexico Forestry Development&#13;
Project (Loan 3115-ME) in the two northern forest-rich states of Chihuahua and Durango.&#13;
This project was closed due to a failure to meet its development objectives, as&#13;
documented in the Implementation Completion Report (Report No. 14625; June 29,&#13;
1995). The lessons learned from this project include the following:&#13;
(a)   Inadequate environmental and social guidelines at the Bank and in Mexico resulted&#13;
in a three year delay in project implementation due to conditionality regarding an&#13;
environmental baseline study. Since then, the Government has enacted the&#13;
Forestry Law of 1992 and its associated regulations. At the Bank, Operational&#13;
Directives have been issued on environmental topics, but not on Participation&#13;
Plans.&#13;
(b)   An adequate social assessment and plan for stakeholder participation was not&#13;
carried out during preparation, hampering the dialogue with communities, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
local and international non-governmental organizations. The Community Forestry&#13;
Project has carried out a full social assessment at the national level, and at the state&#13;
level in Oaxaca, and discussions have been held with non-governmental&#13;
organizations based in Oaxaca and Mexico City.&#13;
(c)   Lack of state government participation and commitment to the project hampered&#13;
project implementation. The Community Forestry Project has had strong support&#13;
from the Governor of Oaxaca, who has established a State Coordinating&#13;
Commission for the project with representatives of the most relevant state level&#13;
Secretariats.&#13;
(d)   Even though the administration changed between project appraisal and&#13;
negotiations, the project was not reappraised, leading to a lack of ownership, and&#13;
inadequate project implementation procedures. The Community Forestry Project&#13;
has been prepared with the new administration within the new institutional&#13;
framework in Mexico, and anticipates the Government's policy of deconcentration&#13;
and decentralization.&#13;
(e)   The project never received adequate budgetary resources. The Community&#13;
Forestry Project has already been assigned a budget for retroactive financing and&#13;
for the first year of project implementation, and there is strong commitment to&#13;
continue providing budgetary support.&#13;
1.43  Recognizing the complexity of the sector and its need for a more clearly defined&#13;
strategy, the Government requested Bank assistance to carry out a sector study, finalized&#13;
as the Mexico Resource Conservation and Forestry Sector Review (Grey Cover Report&#13;
No. 131 14-ME; March 31, 1995). This joint effort identified several key constraints to&#13;
the development of the forestry sector, including: (a) lack of adequate transport and&#13;
production infrastructure; (b) lack of information on business opportunities, markets, and&#13;
technologies; (c) lack of timely credit on appropriate terms; (c) undifferentiated product&#13;
markets and price volatility; (d) uncertainty regarding land tenure and boundary&#13;
demarcations; (e) underutilization of non-timber and non-traditional forest resources; (f)&#13;
poorly trained community and ejido resource managers and workers; and (g) the loss of&#13;
resources as a result of deforestation and the loss of biodiversity. The sector study has&#13;
shown that forestry has a much greater economic potential than is being realized, a large&#13;
share of which could reach the poorest communities and ejidos.&#13;
1.44  Based on this analysis of constraints and economic potential, a strategy has been&#13;
developed for the sector on which the Government and the Bank agree. The Government&#13;
has already announced its strategy for the sector, and has requested Bank support for this&#13;
pilot operation that could lead to similar operations in the other five states with pine-oak&#13;
forests. This project builds on prior experience, sector work, and other work such as the&#13;
ejido-to-ejido training supported by the Institutional Development Fund Grant (IDF Grant;&#13;
Grant Number TF 28855), and continuing dialogue and consultation with stakeholders in&#13;
the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
Origin&#13;
2.1   This proposed project was prepared based on the recommendations of a workshop&#13;
held to discuss the findings of the Grey Cover Mexico Resource Conservation and Forest&#13;
Sector Review (Report No. 13114-ME; March 31, 1995). At that workshop&#13;
representatives of the federal government, state governments, communities, ejidos, non-&#13;
governmental organizations, academics, and others gathered to discuss the&#13;
recommendations presented in the Sector Review, and agree on next steps. The&#13;
workshop confirmed the need for a pilot operation to provide technical assistance and&#13;
training to the communities, to strengthen the private sector providers of services, to&#13;
enhance opportunities for testing the potential of non-timber and non-traditional forest&#13;
products, as well as strengthening Government approval and monitoring functions.&#13;
2.2   Oaxaca was selected as an appropriate site for this pilot operation due to: strong&#13;
and well organized forestry communities and ejidos which own 90 percent of the forestry&#13;
resources within the state; important forestry resources within the state, including pine-&#13;
oak forests with commercial potential; high biodiversity within the forestry areas under&#13;
community management, that could benefit from protection; experience by communities&#13;
with private providers of forestry services, which could be further developed; successful&#13;
sustainable use of some non-timber forest products such as white mushrooms; and strong&#13;
support from the Governor of Oaxaca.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.3   The overall objective of the project is to support the implementation of key&#13;
elements in the Government's redefined natural resource management strategy. Specific&#13;
objectives of the project are to: (a) improve natural resource management and&#13;
conservation by community and ejido forestry resource owners; and (b) increase the range&#13;
of forestry-based income generating options available to them. To this end, the project&#13;
would (a) strengthen the capacity of communities and ejidos to manage their forest&#13;
resource base; (b) strengthen the capacity of the private sector to provide forestry services&#13;
to communities and ejidos; (c) design strategies to promote timber, non-timber, and non-&#13;
traditional products from community and ejido forests; and (d) strengthen the federal and&#13;
state institutions working in forestry conservation and development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Beneficiaries&#13;
2.4   The primary beneficiaries would be participating forestry communities and ejidos&#13;
in Oaxaca, who would apply to participate in the technical assistance and training&#13;
program, and who would be eligible for project activities on the basis of the forestry&#13;
resources under their control, their use of those resources, and the quality of their&#13;
proposals for technical assistance. Other beneficiaries would include: the private providers&#13;
of services to the communities and ejidos, who would receive training and certification;&#13;
communities and ejidos who could apply for funds to research and develop timber and&#13;
NTFP; other communities and ejidos who would be involved in the exchange of&#13;
experiences with each other; and state and federal institutions involved in the forestry&#13;
sector.&#13;
Government Commitment&#13;
2.5   During preparation the project has enjoyed the strong support of the Governments&#13;
of Mexico and the State of Oaxaca. During the identification mission, SEMARNAP&#13;
indicated that an operation focused on improving community management of forestry&#13;
resources was a priority in the Secretariat's work program, and requested that project&#13;
preparation be accelerated. The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaria de&#13;
Hacienda y Credito Publico; SHCP) endorsed this request. SEMARNAP then put&#13;
together a strong project preparation team. Budgetary resources have already been&#13;
allocated by SEMARNAP and SHCP in the 1996 and 1997 budget for project&#13;
implementation activities. At the state level in Oaxaca, the Governor has repeatedly&#13;
expressed his strong support, and has appointed a State Coordinating Commission for the&#13;
project.&#13;
Participation in Project Preparation&#13;
2.6   The project has been designed and will be implemented with the participation of&#13;
forest communities and ejidos, Oaxacan and national non-governmental organizations, and&#13;
other stakeholders. It includes all four categories of activities to foster participation:&#13;
(a)   Information Sharing has included the translation and distribution of the Project&#13;
Information Document in Spanish, a national workshop to discuss the&#13;
Government's sectoral strategy with a broad range of stakeholders, and meetings&#13;
with Oaxacan and national non-governmental organizations.&#13;
(b)   Consultation has included focus group meetings with Oaxacan forest communities&#13;
at three stages - preparation, preappraisal, and appraisal - on project design and the&#13;
menu of technical assistance and training. The project will finance regional fora&#13;
for continued consultation with potential beneficiaries during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(c)   Participation in implementation will be fostered by delegating responsibility and&#13;
control to communities to contract their own technical assistance services and&#13;
request short and long term training.&#13;
(d)   Ownership will be transferred to communities by developing long range planning&#13;
and business development skills, through participatory monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of technical assistance support, and by financing community initiated and managed&#13;
seminars to exchange knowledge.&#13;
SUMMARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.7   The project would have the following components:&#13;
(a)   Assistance to Communities and lljidos (US$ 10.3 million Total Costs). This&#13;
component would be based in Oaxaca and would finance promotional activities,&#13;
private technical assistance, short and long term training, and community-to-&#13;
community training for : (i) preparing and updating management plans for timber&#13;
extraction based on regenerative capacity, making appropriate tradeoffs between&#13;
processing and marketing, improving reforestation practices, and undertaking&#13;
resource conservation; (ii) preparing conservation plans for forested areas; (iii)&#13;
integrated resource management and forestry research; (iv) silvicultural skills, and&#13;
control of fire and insects; (v) understanding boundary demarcation issues of&#13;
comnmunity and ejido lands so as to enable communities and ejidos to implement&#13;
their management plans and productive activities without conflict over boundaries;&#13;
(vi) accessing credit, markets, and technologies; (vii) increasing the efficiency of&#13;
forestry activities and enterprises; (viii) business and management skills; and (ix)&#13;
financial management of the resource base by communities and ejidos.&#13;
(b)   Strengthening of the Capacity of Private Service Providers (US$ 1.6 million&#13;
Total Costs). This component would be based in Oaxaca and would finance the&#13;
training necessary to enable private sector providers to work with communities and&#13;
ejidos in sustainable integrated forest management practices, multiple-use forestry,&#13;
reforestation technologies, silviculture, innovative environmentally sound&#13;
technologies, forest protection, and nursery practices. It would also finance&#13;
consultants and equipment needed to review and strengthen the Government's&#13;
certification and evaluation program for private sector providers.&#13;
(c)   Promotion of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) (US$ 3.2 million Total&#13;
Costs). This component would be based in the six priority states with pine-oak&#13;
forest, and would finance: (i) diagnostic studies; (ii) grants for the purchase of&#13;
tools, materials, equipment, temporary civil works, technical assistance and limited&#13;
inputs for the development of NTFP; and (iii) salaries, consultants, equipment,&#13;
materials, and publications, for the evaluation and dissemination of results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
(d)   Institutional Strengthening Component (US$ 8.5 million Total Costs). This&#13;
component would finance consultants, salaries, studies, equipment, training&#13;
programs, vehicles, travel related expenditures, and workshops to strengthen&#13;
SEMARNAP, SEDAF and state forestry agencies in the other five priority states&#13;
with pine-oak forest, to carry out their mandated forestry activities, and to manage&#13;
and implement the project. The pilot project in Oaxaca would be carefully&#13;
monitored, and based on that experience, projects would be designed by&#13;
SEMARNAP and the state environmental agencies to replicate the experience in&#13;
the other five priority states of Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, and&#13;
Michoacan.&#13;
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Assistance to Communities and Ejidos&#13;
2.8   The objective of this component is to channel resources to forested communities&#13;
and ejidos in Oaxaca with pine-oak forests for technical assistance and training in&#13;
improved forest management, conservation and sustainable use of natural resource areas&#13;
with high environmental value, and improved management of forest enterprises. Technical&#13;
assistance is tailored to the needs of the four categories of forestry communities and&#13;
ejidos: (a) 122 communities with no management plans and no commercial extraction; (b)&#13;
41 communities that sell standing timber, but do not harvest the timber themselves; (c) 43&#13;
communities that harvest and sell cut timber, but have no processing capacity; and (d) 30&#13;
communities with harvesting and processing enterprises, including communities that are&#13;
grouped into forestry unions. This component has three sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Promotional Activities. This subcomponent would finance communications&#13;
specialists, non-governmental organizations, consultants, salaries, equipment,&#13;
workshops, and promotional materials, including video and radio, to inform&#13;
potential participants about the scope of the available assistance, carry out 175&#13;
participatory rapid appraisals, promote regional fora for community participation,&#13;
and evaluate the needs and interests of participants in order to better design&#13;
training programs and future activities. Given the low level of involvement of&#13;
women in the forestry sector, special effort will be made to promote those aspects&#13;
of the project in which women could become interested, such as scholarships and&#13;
non-timber forest products.&#13;
(b)   Technical Assistance. This sub-component would finance part of the costs of the&#13;
technical assistance provided by private providers under contracts with&#13;
participating communities and ejidos. Topics would be deterrnined by the&#13;
communities and ejidos, based on eligibility criteria, and could include:&#13;
management plans for timber extraction based on regenerative capacity;&#13;
conservation plans for forested areas; integrated resource management and forestry&#13;
research; and forest enterprise efficiency. Under no circumstances would this sub-&#13;
component finance prefeasibility studies for investment in harvesting or processing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
equipment, or any roads-related civil works or engineering studies. Private&#13;
providers will also be excluded from providing technical assistance on any&#13;
investment decisions in equipment or infrastructure. The project would cover the&#13;
technical assistance costs (net of taxes) as follows: (a) 100 percent for&#13;
communities without management plans; (b) 80 percent for communities selling&#13;
standing timber; (c) 65 percent for communities harvesting timber; and (d) 50&#13;
percent for communities with processing enterprises.&#13;
(c)   Training. This sub-component would finance the design and implementation of&#13;
training courses by universities, academic institutions, and individual trainers, for&#13;
community and ejido members on a demand-driven basis. During the first year of&#13;
their participation, a course on environmental impact and conservation would be&#13;
required for all communities and ejidos requesting technical assistance. Courses&#13;
would initially be developed on: environmental impact assessments; silvicultural&#13;
skills; analysis of contents of management plans; administrative and accounting&#13;
skills; community organization for forestry enterprises; control of fire and insects;&#13;
technical harvesting and processing skills; investment decision-making for&#13;
harvesting and processing; legal and regulatory norms; conservation options;&#13;
understanding boundary demarcation issues of community and ejido lands; and&#13;
accessing credit, markets, and technologies. As demand for training becomes&#13;
known (through attendance, and discussions at regional fora), the training&#13;
programs and offerings would be modified. A limited number of community&#13;
members would be eligible for two-year scholarships for forestry training in the&#13;
state of Oaxaca, and for four-year undergraduate scholarships for forestry&#13;
management elsewhere in Mexico. In addition, the project would include a budget&#13;
at federal level for demand-driven proposals from forest ejidos and communities to&#13;
hold regional or national community-to-community seminars to exchange&#13;
information among communities on forestry development and conservation&#13;
activities.&#13;
Strengthening the Capacity of Private Service Providers&#13;
2.9   The objective of this component is to broaden the range, increase the quality, and&#13;
improve the availability of technical services offered by private service providers to forest&#13;
producers in Oaxaca. This component would have the following sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Roster of Private Providers. This sub-component would finance consultants,&#13;
salaries, equipment, travel-related expenses, and materials to invite Oaxacan, other&#13;
Mexican, and international private providers to participate in the project and to&#13;
design and hold orientation and immersion programs for the private providers that&#13;
pre-qualify. The two week orientation and immersion programs would include&#13;
overview courses, plus field work. Since attendance at the orientation and&#13;
immersion programs is mandatory, the income foregone by the private providers&#13;
while attending the two week courses would serve as their contribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Satisfactory completion of the curriculum, field work, and final exam would be&#13;
requirements for joining the roster.&#13;
(b)   Continuing Education Program. This sub-component would finance consultants,&#13;
equipment, consultant travel-related expenses, and materials to design and hold&#13;
comprehensive short courses at post-graduate level on a variety of subjects,&#13;
including: forest management; forest ecology and silviculture; maintenance of&#13;
native forest structure and biodiversity, watershed protection, wildlife&#13;
management, integrated resource management; NTFP; environmental assessments;&#13;
harvesting, transport and primary manufacturing; social aspects of forestry&#13;
development; marketing, legal and regulatory aspects; and financial and economic&#13;
aspects. To the extent possible, training currently being given at existing academic&#13;
institutions would be adapted for use in the continuing education program. Private&#13;
providers are required to attend one course each year in order to maintain their&#13;
status on the roster, therefore the income foregone by the private providers to&#13;
attend the courses would serve as their contribution.&#13;
Promotion of Non-Timber Forest Products&#13;
2.10  The objective of this pilot intervention would be to identify, promote, and&#13;
demonstrate market opportunities for potentially tradable NTFPs in community and ejido&#13;
forests where NTFPs are integrated into the management plans. To achieve these&#13;
objectives, the component would address the main factors constraining NTFP&#13;
development, by providing information on markets and sustainable technologies, technical&#13;
assistance, and access to funds to implement the technical packages. Communities and&#13;
ejidos in Oaxaca, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Michoacan, and Jalisco, would be&#13;
eligible for grants if they could demonstrate that they have forest ecosystems defined as a&#13;
minimum of ten percent crown cover of trees, generally associated with wild flora, fauna&#13;
and natural soil conditions, and not subject to agricultural practices. Rare or endangered&#13;
species listed in either the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of&#13;
Fauna and Flora or under Mexican regulations as listed in Norma Official Mexicana 059&#13;
would be excluded.&#13;
2.11  The component would have three sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Diagnostic Studies. This sub-component would finance consultants, equipment,&#13;
and publications to undertake diagnostic studies in the six priority states. The&#13;
main aim of the studies would be to compile a comprehensive data base on the&#13;
extent, management, production, use and trade of NTFPs in participating states, so&#13;
as to identify the unrealized potential for NTFPs, and to identify those which may&#13;
be overexploited and in need of conservation.&#13;
(b)   Grant Fund. This sub-component would provide small grants to communities and&#13;
ejidos for the purchase of tools, materials, field and packaging equipment,&#13;
temporary civil works, technical assistance, and limited inputs, in order to field test&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
promising proposals for the development and improved management of potentially&#13;
tradable, environmentally sustainable, NTFPs. Additional criteria would include&#13;
maximum project size of US$ 20,000 of which 25 percent would be financed by&#13;
the community, one project per product per state per year, with a maximum of&#13;
three projects per product per state over the life of the project. The process would&#13;
be demand driven, competitive and transparent whereby communities and ejidos in&#13;
participating states would be invited to compete for grants.&#13;
(c)   Monitoring and Dissernination of Results. This sub-component would finance&#13;
salaries, consultants, equipment, materials, and publications in each of the six state&#13;
delegations to promote, monitor, evaluate, and disseminate results and&#13;
experiences, so that communities in other areas could be made aware of the&#13;
income generating potential of NTFPs.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
2.12  The objective of this component is to strengthen the federal and state institutions&#13;
working in forestry conservation and development. Specifically, this component would&#13;
strengthen the capacity of: (a) federal institutions to carry out normative and enforcement&#13;
activities that have a direct impact on community forestry; (b) state government&#13;
institutions in the six priority states with pine-oak forests in preparation for the eventual&#13;
decentralization of resources and responsibilities; (c) Project Management and Project&#13;
Implementation Units in SEMARNAP in Mexico City and SEMARNAP Oaxaca to&#13;
implement the project; and (d) federal and state institutions to monitor the pilot activities&#13;
in Oaxaca, and prepare similar projects in the other five priority states with pine-oak&#13;
forests. This component would have the following sub-components:&#13;
(a)   Review of Forestry Management and Conservation Plans. This sub-component&#13;
would finance consultants, salaries, field and computer equipment, vehicles, and&#13;
operating expenditures to strengthen the review, approval, and audit of forestry&#13;
management and conservation plans by the Sub-Delegation of Natural Resources,&#13;
the Sub-Delegation of Environment, the Judicial Unit, and the PFPA Delegation,&#13;
all within SEMARNAP in Oaxaca.&#13;
(b)   SEMARNAP Delegations and State Secretariats. This sub-component would&#13;
finance equipment, staff, and operating expenses to strengthen the SEMARNAP&#13;
delegations and the State Secretariats in the five other priority states with pine-oak&#13;
forests. This would assist SEMARNAP in the process of deconcentration of&#13;
resources and responsibilities from the federal level to the SEMARNAP state&#13;
delegations, followed by the decentralization of resources and responsibilities from&#13;
the SEMARNAP state delegations to the State Secretariats.&#13;
(c)   Sistema Nacional de Informacion Forestal (SNIF). This sub-component would&#13;
finance consultants to design an Internet based system that would enable private&#13;
producers, academics, non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
others, to access Govermnent information and to create their own databases within&#13;
the system. As part of the SNIF, the Registro Nacional Forestal would be&#13;
computerized. The Registro is a public register of all the activities that are&#13;
regulated by the Government. At present, the Registro includes a roster of&#13;
certified private providers of technical forestry services, the approved forestry&#13;
management plans, cutting permits, forestry enterprise permits, approved changes&#13;
in land use, and forestry inventories. The sub-component would also finance&#13;
computer hardware and software, terminals at all the state delegations, system&#13;
administration staff, and maintenance.&#13;
(d)   Skills Upgrading. This sub-component would finance consultants, course&#13;
materials, facilities, instructors' fees, and travel-related expenses, for skills&#13;
upgrading through training and scholarships for staff at the federal level and at the&#13;
state level in the six priority states with pine-oak forests. Selected staff would&#13;
attend the technical forestry training courses designed for the private providers.&#13;
Some training programs would be designed to upgrade administrative and&#13;
technology skills. Scholarships for two-year courses and short study tours would&#13;
be available on a limited basis.&#13;
(e)   Project Management and Implementation Units. This sub-component would&#13;
finance two units: a Project Management Unit at SEMARNAP in Mexico City&#13;
reporting to the Director General of DGF, and including: sufficient qualified staff,&#13;
such as a coordinator, procurement specialist, technical expert, and liaison with&#13;
Oaxaca; equipment; travel-related expenses; and operating expenses; and a Project&#13;
Implementation Unit at SEMARNAP in Oaxaca reporting to the SEMARNAP&#13;
Delegate in Oaxaca, including: sufficient qualified staff such as a coordinator,&#13;
administrator, project promoter, four regional promoters, training officer,&#13;
procurement advisor to communities, biodiversity advisor; equipment; travel-&#13;
related expenses; and operating expenses. In order to permit the effective&#13;
monitoring of the environment within which the project operates, this component&#13;
would finance two studies, the first would consist of periodic surveys of&#13;
deforestation in Oaxaca, aided by aerial photography; and the second would&#13;
consist of periodic surveys of forestry-related community income in Oaxaca.&#13;
(f)   Project Preparation in Five Priority States. This sub-component would finance&#13;
consultants, travel-related expenses, and workshops to prepare projects in the five&#13;
other priority states with pine-oak forests: Chihuahua, Durango, Michoacan,&#13;
Jalisco, and Guerrero. This project is piloting an approach to working with&#13;
communities and ejidos to improve their management of forestry resources.&#13;
SEMARNAP would evaluate the experience in Oaxaca, and extend the approach&#13;
to other states, possibly with the support of Bank financed projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
JUSTIFICATION&#13;
Rationale for Project Design&#13;
2.13  The project has been designed to empower the communities and ejidos in their&#13;
decision making as to the nature, extent, and timing of the training and technical assistance&#13;
on sustainable forestry management they would receive. Private providers of technical&#13;
assistance will be hired by the communities through community procurement procedures.&#13;
To improve the skills of these private providers, training is being provided through the&#13;
project. To enable communities to make full use of their forestry resources, the project&#13;
would promote NTFPs as an alternative to traditional timber products. Existing&#13;
institutions that are involved in the regulation or enforcement of the forestry sector are&#13;
being strengthened. Activities that are clearly related to the existence of a Bank financed&#13;
project are being handled by Project Management and Project Implementation Units at the&#13;
federal and state level. A detailed monitoring and evaluation system is included, given the&#13;
pilot nature of the activities in Oaxaca, and the Government's intention of replicating the&#13;
successes of the pilot in the five other priority states with pine-oak forest.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.14  The proposed project would provide strong support to the Government's strategy&#13;
for the forestry sector. It would strengthen environmental management, address issues of&#13;
income generation in some of the poorest indigenous communities in the south of Mexico,&#13;
and would support the process of administrative decentralization, all priorities in the&#13;
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Mexico (Report No. 16056-ME; October 15,&#13;
1996), and would complement ongoing environmental and poverty-focused operations in&#13;
Mexico. As a pilot project, it would provide a unique opportunity to learn valuable&#13;
lessons on how to work with communities to undertake natural resource management&#13;
activities.&#13;
Program Objective Categories&#13;
2.15  The proportion of the poor among project beneficiaries is expected to be&#13;
significantly larger than their proportion in the overall population, therefore this project&#13;
fits the criteria for inclusion in the Program of Targeted Interventions. The project&#13;
belongs primarily to the Environmentally Sustainable Development and Poverty&#13;
Reduction and Human Resource Development program objective categories. Given its&#13;
focus on communities and ejidos, and on private service providers, the project also&#13;
belongs to the Private Sector Development program objective category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
3. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.1   To the extent possible, project activities will be implemented by existing line&#13;
agencies that already have the mandate to carry out the activities. This will reduce&#13;
duplication and strengthen the institutions. At the same time, activities that are clearly&#13;
related to a Bank financed project, such as procurement and disbursement, have been&#13;
separated and placed into Project Management and Project Implementation Units. The&#13;
Government has appointed oversight committees at the state and federal level to monitor&#13;
and guide the process of project implementation.&#13;
Line Agencies&#13;
3.2   Direccion General Forestal. DGF will be responsible for most of the project&#13;
activities that take place at the federal level. The Project Management Unit in Mexico&#13;
City will report directly to the Director General Forestal.&#13;
3.3   Direccion General Forestal's Direccion de Aprovechamiento Forestal. DAF&#13;
would be responsible for implementing the activities within the project that fall within its&#13;
mandate: (a) Assistance to Communities and Ejidos - managing the community to&#13;
community seminars; (b) Strengthening the Capacity of Private Service Providers -&#13;
preparing and managing a roster of private providers for the project, designing the&#13;
orientation and immersion courses and the continuing education program for the private&#13;
providers in consultation with the Sub-Delegation of Planning in SEMARNAP Oaxaca;&#13;
(c) Promotion of NTFPs - contracting and supervising the diagnostic studies on NTFPs in&#13;
the six priority states with pine-oak forests, and doing evaluations of completed projects&#13;

PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
3.14  Total project costs, including contingencies and taxes are estimated at about US$&#13;
23.6 million equivalent.&#13;

3.15  Baseline costs are estimated at US$ 19.4 million and physical contingencies at US$&#13;
2.2 million or 11 percent of total baseline project costs. Price contingencies between&#13;
negotiations and project completion are estimated at US$ 2.0 million equivalent, or about&#13;
9 percent of project baseline costs plus physical contingencies. Annual price increases&#13;
were applied to foreign costs in all categories in US Dollar terms at a rate of 2.6 percent.&#13;
Annual price increases for local costs were calculated using World Bank estimates.&#13;
Foreign and local price contingencies are expressed in US Dollar equivalents, assuming&#13;
purchasing power parity during the six year disbursement period.&#13;
Project Financing&#13;
3.16  The proposed Bank loan of US$ 15.0 million would finance about 75 percent of&#13;
total costs excluding taxes, which is justified given the continuing macroeconomic&#13;
situation in Mexico, the nature of the project, and the three-year cost sharing ratio for&#13;
Bank loans in Mexico. The Bank loan will be a US Dollar single currency variable term&#13;
loan. Of the balance, US$ 6.8 million would be financed by the Government, and US$ 1.8&#13;
million would be financed by the communities. Foreign exchange accounts for 12 percent&#13;
of the total costs of the project. The Bank will cover an amount equivalent to the total&#13;
amount of foreign exchange costs (US$ 2.7 million) plus 71 percent of local costs&#13;
excluding taxes (US$ 12.3 million), bringing Bank participation in aggregate up to about&#13;
64 percent of total project costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
3.17 Nacional Financiera S. N. C. (NAFIN) would be the Borrower, and would sign an&#13;
agreement for the transfer of the loan proceeds to SEMARNAP as the Executing Agency,&#13;
as a condition of Loan Effectiveness.&#13;
PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.18  All project components financed under the proposed Bank loan would be procured&#13;
in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD and IDA Credits (January&#13;
1995, revised January and August 1996). Standard bidding documents agreed to by the&#13;
Bank and the Government will be used for the procurement of goods under National&#13;
Competitive Bidding. The Bank would finance computer and office equipment, field&#13;
equipment, promotional equipment, publications, training, consulting services, and&#13;
community grants. No vehicles would be financed by the Bank. No incremental recurrent&#13;
costs would be financed by the Bank. Table 2 summarizes the procurement arrangements.&#13;

3.19  Goods. Goods to be procured under the project consist of computer hardware&#13;
and software, office equipment, furniture and promotional material, which in total amounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
to US$ 1.6 million. To the extent possible, goods will be grouped in packages valued at&#13;
US$ 350,000 or more and procured through Intemational Competitive Bidding. Packages&#13;
of similar equipment valued under US$ 350,000, but higher than US$ 50,000 up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$ 800,000 would be procured through National Competitive&#13;
Bidding. Packages of similar nature valued under US$ 50,000 up to an aggregate of US$&#13;
200,000 would be procured through National or Intemational Shopping procedures, based&#13;
on price quotations from at least three bidders. Vehicles will not be financed by the Bank.&#13;
The contracts for Intemational Competitive Bidding, and the first five contracts for&#13;
National Competitive Bidding regardless of value, would be subject to prior review by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
3.20  Consultants. The selection and appointment of consultants for training, studies,&#13;
technical assistance and promotional activities will follow the Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants (August 1981). Terms of reference, short lists, letters of invitation and draft&#13;
contracts for consultancies with firms valued above US$ 100,000, and for consultancies&#13;
with individuals valued above US$ 50,000, would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
Consultant terms of reference would be subject to prior review regardless of the value of&#13;
the contract. Exemptions from prior review do not apply to consultant contracts below&#13;
the thresholds in cases of: single source selection of firms; assignments of a critical nature;&#13;
and amendments to contracts raising the original contract value above the thresholds. All&#13;
contracts not subject to prior review would be subject to ex-post review by the Bank&#13;
during supervision on a selective basis. The proposed review arrangements are expected&#13;
to result in a prior review coverage level of about 50 percent of Bank-financed contracts.&#13;
3.21  The communities would hire private providers for technical assistance. In order to&#13;
facilitate this community procurement, the roster of private providers, the standardized&#13;
terms of reference, the community and technical assistance eligibility criteria, and the&#13;
standard contract would be subject to prior review by the Bank. The signed contracts&#13;
would be subject to ex-post review by the Bank during supervision on a selective basis.&#13;
All contracts that did not conform to the standard terms of reference would be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Bank.&#13;
3.22 Grants. Grants for the development of NTFP would be given to communities and&#13;
ejidos. Grants for projects with a value of not higher than US$ 20,000 each would be&#13;
granted under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The Bank would carry out a&#13;
prior review of the selection criteria and the selection panels, and ex-post review of the&#13;
grant awards. The first ten contracts under community procurement regardless of value,&#13;
would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
3.23  The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2001, and the Loan&#13;
closing date is June 30, 2002. The borrower will establish a Special Account in Banco de&#13;
Mexico, with an initial deposit of US$ 1.0 million, equal to about four months' estimated&#13;
average disbursements, under established procedures between the Bank and the&#13;
Government of Mexico. Disbursements from the Loan account will be made on 70&#13;
percent of the total value excluding taxes of expenditures for goods, and 100 percent of&#13;
the total value excluding taxes of expenditures disbursed by SEMARNAP for consultants,&#13;
studies, training, and grants. Disbursements against consultant contracts below US$&#13;
100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000 for individual consultants, as well as for expenditures&#13;
for grants, training (not covered by a consultant contract) and for goods under contracts&#13;
below US$ 350,000, will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
Disbursements against contracts above the prior review limits will be made against full&#13;
documentation submitted to the Bank. This project shall permit retroactive financing up&#13;

3.24 SEMARNAP and NAFIN will maintain all project accounts. All accounts will&#13;
adequately reflect expenditures made in respect of the project, in accordance with sound&#13;
accounting practices acceptable to the Bank. A certified copy of the project audit,&#13;
prepared by independent and qualified auditors, and in accordance with the Guidelines for&#13;
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982)&#13;
will be submitted to the Bank by June 30 of each year, which is not more than six months&#13;
after the completion of the fiscal year on December 31. The audit report will include a&#13;
separate opinion by the auditor on procurement, the use of the Special Account, as well as&#13;
on disbursements against certified Statements of Expenditure. Statements of Expenditure&#13;
and other audit-related material will be made available to Bank supervision missions as&#13;
requested. The Government will have the project accounts audited using procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, in line with the Audit Agreement of November, 1991, between the&#13;
Bank and the General Secretariat of the Comptroller of the Federation.&#13;
MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.25  Monitoring and Evaluation. Six indicators have been selected against which&#13;
successful implementation would be measured: (a) annual budgetary allocation; (b)&#13;
increased forest area under improved management; (c) hectares under conservation by&#13;
communities; (d) number of private providers in the project roster; (e) number of non-&#13;
timber forest products successfully implemented; and (f) percentage of management plans&#13;
reviewed within the legally mandated 30 day limit.&#13;
3.26 The Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico City would have primary&#13;
responsibility for project supervision, monitoring and evaluation. It would be responsible&#13;
for guiding project implementation through annual planning, budgeting, and reporting.&#13;
Each agency, and the communities receiving technical assistance, training, or grants,&#13;
would have the responsibility of monitoring the activities within their mandate, and&#13;
reporting to the Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico City on a quarterly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
basis. The Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico City would consolidate&#13;
and distribute internal quarterly reports measuring progress against indicators. On an&#13;
annual basis, the Unit would prepare a detailed Project Implementation Report on: the&#13;
general status of the project; project administration, organization and management;&#13;
achievements, problems, and recommended actions; tables of input, output, outcome, and&#13;
impact indicators; status of disbursements; and status of legal covenants. Based on this&#13;
Project Implementation Report, the Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico&#13;
City would prepare an Annual Operating Plan and Implementation Schedule, which would&#13;
be discussed and agreed with the Bank and which would include: objectives, activities,&#13;
costs, indicators, implementation schedule and procurement plan.&#13;
3.27  Supervision. The project is expected to require extensive and close supervision&#13;
by the Bank, especially within the first two years. The supervision calendar would include&#13;
a minimum of three missions a year for the first two years, one of which one would be an&#13;
annual review. A project launch workshop would be held after negotiations. It is&#13;
estimated that supervision would require about 20 staff weeks per year, plus about eight&#13;
staff weeks of consultant time per year in the first two years. In addition to project&#13;
management, staff and consultant skills would include forestry, biodiversity, and&#13;
sociology. Special emphasis would be given to supervising the implementation of pilot&#13;
activities in Oaxaca. A mid-term review would be held in mid-1999 to determine: changes&#13;
necessary in the pilot activities in Oaxaca, including cost recovery for private provider&#13;
training programs; transfer of responsibilities as a result of the deconcentration and&#13;
decentralization programs; and expansion of the NTFP grants program to other states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
4. PROJECT ANALYSIS&#13;
SOCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
4.1   Project preparation has included a lengthy process of social assessment and&#13;
participation plan preparation, including a special emphasis on indigenous development,&#13;
given that more than 90 percent of the targeted beneficiaries belong to indigenous&#13;
ethnicities. The social assessment included: (a) country-level sector analysis, with field&#13;
data collection and focus-group interviews; (b) a gender study, with field survey data and&#13;
secondary literature review; (c) an indigenous peoples' assessment as a background study&#13;
within the country-level sector analysis, plus follow-up focus-group interviews in the state&#13;
of Oaxaca; (d) recommendations from community-to-community training workshops,&#13;
carried out as an IDF indigenous training initiative; and (e) social assessment of the four&#13;
categories of forestry communities and ejidos, drawing on community, government, and&#13;
non-governmental organization interviews and workshops.&#13;
4.2   This analysis identified a clear opportunity to involve indigenous forest&#13;
communities and ejidos in improved forest management and forest enterprises. As a result&#13;
of the social analysis, the technical assistance and training support is tailored to different&#13;
levels of community organization, includes the possibility of using community forestry&#13;
technicians as private providers, allows for exchange of experiences between more&#13;
sophisticated and less sophisticated forest communities, and incorporates space for&#13;
cultural values and customary tenure arrangements. The project will include a&#13;
promotional campaign channeled in part through regional gatherings of communities,&#13;
devolving responsibility for these gatherings to community leaders over time. In addition,&#13;
training will be tailored to specific community needs, and courses will be held locally as&#13;
much as possible to encourage busy household heads to attend. The success of project&#13;
activities will be measured through participatory monitoring and evaluation as well as by&#13;
external evaluation of development objectives and performance indicators.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
4.3   The project has been given a Category B rating. It is expected to have a positive&#13;
impact on the sustainable management of forestry resources at the community and ejido&#13;
level by: (a) providing technical assistance to local people in the conservation and&#13;
management of their forestry resources; and (b) ensuring the compatibility of forest&#13;
management with the supply of important non-timber forest products and environmental&#13;
benefits; and (c) discouraging the conversion of forests to croplands or pastures as a result&#13;
of promoting better forest management practices. Because of the nature and small size of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
the physical investments financed under the grants component of the proejct, no&#13;
resettlement is expected or even plausible.&#13;
4.4   The project could have a potentially negative environmental impact as a result of:&#13;
(a) the decentralization of government programs for conservation and management to&#13;
state and local levels, involving weak institutions; (b) unsustainable management practices&#13;
for forests and wildiands being managed for varied uses, including supply of non-timber&#13;
forest products, for which management experience is still relatively new; and (c) the&#13;
intensification of pine-oak forest management resulting in ecological degradation of these&#13;
natural habitats. The project contains multiple environmental safeguards, intended to&#13;
ensure that project-promoted forest management activities would not cause significant&#13;
damage to biodiversity, soils, or water quality. As detailed in SEMARNAP's&#13;
Environmental Analysis (Conservacion y Manejo Sustentable de Recursos Forestales en&#13;
Mexico: Analisis Ambiental; October 1996), these safeguards include the promotion of&#13;
forest conservation plans, environmental training and technical assistance to communities&#13;
and private service providers, a biodiversity advisor, environmental institutional&#13;
strengthening, forestry research, and environmental project monitoring.&#13;
ECONOMIC AND FISCAL ANALYSIS&#13;
4.5   There is strong economic justification for this project, as discussed throughout this&#13;
report: the project concept and design is coherently set in the economic and sector work&#13;
that proceeded it, and fits within the country assistance strategy; the project targets&#13;
indigenous communities in one of the poorest states in Mexico; the project design is&#13;
optimal given the constraints in the sector; technical, environmental, and institutional risks&#13;
have been carefully evaluated, and actions have been included in the project to reduce&#13;
these risks; and indicators have been devised to monitor project performance.&#13;
4.6   The Government of Mexico has justified the fiscal outlays associated with this&#13;
project for social and environrnental reasons, given that the indigenous communities in&#13;
Oaxaca are among the poorest in Mexico, and that their successful management of their&#13;
forestry resources could increase the range of income-generating options available to these&#13;
communities. At the same time, better management could result in higher value added&#13;
production, more employment in the rural sector, less imports of timber products, and&#13;
perhaps even exports of non-timber products, all of which would generate a positive&#13;
revenue flow through taxation. Communities and ejidos in Oaxaca are known to channel&#13;
surplus resources into community goods such as water supply, drainage, primary&#13;
education, scholarships, and health services. Any increase in revenues at the community&#13;
level, and substitution for publicly provided goods, would reduce the fiscal burden on the&#13;
Government.&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
4.7   The project would empower communities and ejidos in Oaxaca to improve their&#13;
management of forestry resources, and to increase the range of income generating options&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
available to them. It would do so by: closing the knowledge gap through training;&#13;
improving the quality and increasing the range of advisory services available to&#13;
communities through private providers of technical assistance; developing options for&#13;
NTFPs; and improving the services provided to the communities by Government&#13;
institutions. The project would operationalize innovative thinking in Mexico and&#13;
elsewhere on the best ways to assist indigenous owners of communal property in&#13;
sustainable management of their resource base. If successful, the project would provide a&#13;
model that could be replicated in other indigenous communities that are willing to&#13;
undertake sustainable natural resource management activities.&#13;
4.8   Project benefits are concentrated on poor and indigenous families in Oaxaca.&#13;
Ninety percent of the target population is indigenous and forested areas covered by the&#13;
project are all within municipalities defined as poor and marginal. Oaxacan communities&#13;
make a concerted effort to distribute employment and training opportunities widely, and to&#13;
channel surplus resources into community goods. In addition, community forest&#13;
development plans in the more organized communities reflect a cultural value on&#13;
investments of forest income in activities that generate diversity of production and&#13;
therefore increase employment. The experience in some communities suggests that as&#13;
sustainable management of the resource increases, communities can increase harvesting,&#13;
invest in improved and more diversified processing, and over the medium-term begin to&#13;
invest in other employment-generating, timber or non-timber cash crop activities.&#13;
PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.9   Following on the heels of the unsuccessful Mexico Forestry Development Project,&#13;
this project could receive unusually high scrutiny and residual criticism. External factors&#13;
could significantly reduce the prospects for the forestry sector in Mexico: the&#13;
implementation of the current PROCAMPO program favors the short term conversion of&#13;
forestry lands to agriculture; trade with North America has increased the availability of&#13;
lower cost, higher quality, forestry products in the main markets in Mexico; population&#13;
growth may increase pressure to convert forested areas to agriculture; and credit for&#13;
forestry activities is not always available on a timely basis. Project objectives are limited&#13;
and appropriate, and would enable communities to improve the long term productivity of&#13;
their resource base.&#13;
4.10  The project poses other significant risks. The most important of these is that the&#13;
major project components are demand driven, and although consultations with&#13;
communities and private providers have indicated a high level of demand, there is&#13;
substantial risk of failure as a result of lack of demand. Promotional activities have been&#13;
designed into the project to increase demand for technical assistance and training on the&#13;
part of the communities, and to increase awareness and interest on the part of the private&#13;
providers. Even if there is high demand, it may not be phased according to the&#13;
assumptions made in the project, leading to slower implementation than is currently&#13;
expected. Careful management by federal and state agencies is necessary to make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
adjustments during implementation. The possibility of revising the project at midterm also&#13;
allows flexibility in terms of responding to actual demand.&#13;
4.11  Also potentially hampering implementation is the weakness of the project agencies&#13;
at federal and state level. The project is front-loading technical assistance and equipment&#13;
provided to these agencies in order to mitigate this risk, but this strategy will only be&#13;
effective if the necessary staff to implement and manage the project are hired on a timely&#13;
basis, and staff remain in place over the medium term. As with other projects in Mexico,&#13;
adequate counterpart funding may not be available. While the project has little leverage&#13;
over the fiscal management systems of the Government, the fact that a budgetary&#13;
allocation has been made for counterpart funding during preparation for retroactive&#13;
financing and for the first year of project implementation indicates the priority the&#13;
Government has placed on this project.&#13;
4.12  Project activities pose certain risks. Activities undertaken by communities and&#13;
ejidos could pose environmental risk; mitigating measures have been included in the&#13;
project, and would have to be carefully monitored and adjusted as needed. Private&#13;
providers may not have the technical skills necessary to give the proper advice to&#13;
communities and ejidos. The private provider registration process and continuing&#13;
education program, as well as the exclusion of private providers from giving technical&#13;
assistance on investment decisions, are some of the mechanisms that have been designed&#13;
to provide a safety net for the communities. The market for non-traditional timber and&#13;
non-timber forest products is largely unknown and could lead to overexploitation of&#13;
valuable products or to underutilization of the grant facility. The initial diagnostic studies&#13;
should prevent any grant funds from being used for overexploited species, rare or&#13;
endangered species listed in either the Convention on International Trade in Endangered&#13;
Species of Fauna and Flora or under Mexican regulations as listed in Norma Official&#13;
Mexicana 059 would be excluded, and the evaluation at midterm would permit an&#13;
adjustment to the pilot mechanism.&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.13  The project would finance institutional strengthening activities that are expected to&#13;
be sustainable in the medium term. In addition, better management of timber resources&#13;
would result in longer, sustainable extraction of the resource. Commercially viable,&#13;
environmentally sustainable non-timber and non-traditional timber activities would&#13;
generate income for their continuation. Demand for the services of private providers is&#13;
likely to continue in the post-project period as a result of the expected increase in the&#13;
number of communities managing their forests, and in the intensity of their management.&#13;
With better training and an improved ability to generate resources for the communities and&#13;
ejidos, private providers of technical assistance would be able to provide better services to&#13;
the communities and ejidos, which would also increase the demand for their services.&#13;

MEXICO&#13;
COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
Assistance to Communities and Ejidos&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    There are 236 communities and ejidos in Oaxaca with pine-oak forests. These are&#13;
found in eight regions of Oaxaca: Caniada, Costa, Istmo, Mixteca, Sierra Norte, Sierra&#13;
Sur, Papaloapa, and the Central Valley. In terms of technical assistance and training&#13;
needs, these communities fall into four categories, based on their level of forest&#13;
management and use: (a) Type I communities whose members depend upon subsistence&#13;
agriculture and which do not have any management plans for their forests (122 in&#13;
number); (b) Type 2 communities which have management plans, and sell standing timber&#13;
for lack of harvesting capacity (known as rentistas and 41 in number); (c) Type 3&#13;
communities which have management plans and harvest timber for sale to millers and&#13;
industries, but have no processing capacity of their own (43 in number); and (d) Type 4&#13;
communities and ejidos which have sawmills, and harvest and process their own timber&#13;
(30 in number). Only 12 of the last category have a relatively sophisticated forestry&#13;
enterprise with efficient use of their sawmills and some drying capacity and production of&#13;
higher-value sawnwood. Communities in Types 3 and 4 together produce 85 percent of&#13;
the timber in the state. Table 1 provides more detail on the characteristics of the&#13;
communities that fall into the four different categories and on their forest area and&#13;
allowable timber cut.&#13;
2.    There is substantial diversity within the four broad categories in terms of area of&#13;
forest, access to main roads, internal road infrastructure, and ethnic identity. Overall,&#13;
these communities are geographically isolated from one another and do not group&#13;
themselves into larger political or social units for economic activities or political&#13;
representation. These communities and ejidos are grouped into small municipalities, with&#13;
as few as three communities per municipality. The municipal authorities have played little&#13;
role in forestry, but the individual communities are beginning to develop quite strong&#13;
political identities as a result of indigenous movements and some have created communal&#13;
statutes that codify customary, including forest, rights.&#13;
3.    The three categories which have commercial timber or non-timber extraction&#13;
activities organize these through traditional leadership--the community or ejido leader&#13;
(Comisariado de Bienes Comunales in the case of communities and the Presidente Ejidal&#13;
in the case of ejidos) takes primary responsibility, assisted by a forest enterprise director in&#13;
more sophisticated enterprises or head of extraction in less sophisticated enterprises.&#13;
There can be a high degree of instability due to shifts in forest management introduced&#13;
when community leadership changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
4.    The most developed forest enterprises are in a subset of communities that were&#13;
suppliers of forest concessions until this system was abolished in 1985. An attempt was&#13;
made in 1990 to organize communities and ejidos who were former suppliers into forestry&#13;
unions. In most cases, these unions remained artificial organizations with strong internal&#13;
conflicts of interest. Three unions have emerged as strong organizations: Union de&#13;
Communidades Ixtlan-Etla (IXETO) with three members; Union de Comunidades&#13;
Zapoteca Chinanteca (UZACHI) with four members; and Union de Comunidades y Ejidos&#13;
Forestales de Oaxaca (UCEFO) with three members. These three unions control 40&#13;
percent of the total timber production in Oaxaca and have their own, high-quality,&#13;
technical foresters.&#13;
5.    As in other industrialized communities and ejidos, decisions on annual plans and&#13;
budgets are made in a community assembly with the approval of the Comisariado or&#13;
Presidente. A characteristic of the Oaxaca forest communities which sets them apart from&#13;
those in other states is the cultural value placed by indigenous members on social benefits&#13;
as well as economic profits from forests. The unions distribute a significant portion of&#13;
their profits as social goods--social services and infrastructure, pension funds for indigent&#13;
community members, and job distribution. Communities seek to internalize technical&#13;
services by sending out indigenous community members for training to provide forestry&#13;
services to their community.&#13;
Scope of the Technical Assistance Component&#13;
6.    The component has three subcomponents to provide assistance to the forest ejidos&#13;
and communities of Oaxaca: promotion; technical assistance; and training. The&#13;
component is designed to provide assistance geared to the identified needs of the different&#13;
types of communities and ejidos, enabling them to either improve their forest management&#13;
and enterprises within the existing productive level or to move to a higher level of&#13;
productive organization.&#13;
7.    Promotion. Promotional activities are designed to inform potential participants&#13;
about the scope of the available assistance and create a greater awareness by each&#13;
community of their extractive and non-extractive forestry potential. Promotional activities&#13;
will be more individualized for communities in Types I and 2, given their more limited&#13;
idea of their needs and potential. The promotional activities will include the following:&#13;
* Promotion of regional fora by the four regional offices of SEMARNAP Oaxaca,&#13;
targeting communities within a sub-regional area for meetings bringing leaders and&#13;
other interested community members together within the sub-region to exchange&#13;
information about the program of intervention and channel demands to project&#13;
implementation staff for training and information. SEMARNAP would promote these&#13;
fora, but encourage the communities to invite each other to fora meetings, and over&#13;
time to generate their own agendas for the fora. The regional fora are a means of&#13;
bringing together communities from within a sub-region, to reduce the distance the&#13;
communities must travel, and provide a more personalized transfer of information to&#13;
&#13;

communities, while still treating these communities individually, each network&#13;
functioning over time, but this should be a dynamic that develops without project&#13;
intervention.&#13;
* Participatory rapid appraisals by non-government organizations in about 175&#13;
communities and ejidos over the first three years of the project to transfer analytical&#13;
tools to community members that would enable them to take a more active role in&#13;
natural resource management decisions, and as a means of gathering more reliable&#13;
information about the needs, capabilities, and interests of the communities.&#13;
*  Written pamphlets and manuals in Spanish and indigenous languages directed to&#13;
communities and ejidos, private providers, and government and non-governmental&#13;
institutions interested in the sector regarding management plan content, criteria for&#13;
access to technical assistance and training, methods of evaluating the quality of&#13;
services being provided, environmental concerns, social and cultural values, including&#13;
preservation of cultural sites, marketing tools, business tips, and harvesting and&#13;
processing techniques.&#13;
*  Radio and audio-visual programs, drawing upon the Oaxaca Indigenist Institute radio&#13;
transmitter system to project in indigenous languages as well as Spanish to disseminate&#13;
information about the project and to disseminate technical knowledge or document&#13;
experiences of participating communities.&#13;
* Workshops with non-government organizations and community extension agents to&#13;
disseminate information about the program and encourage these individuals to assist in&#13;
advising communities about the program.&#13;
*  Provision of procurement advisory services to communities on defining needs,&#13;
soliciting bids, preparing a short list or making the decision to contact directly,&#13;
evaluating proposals, selecting a private provider, signing the contract, and&#13;
monitoring compliance with the contract.&#13;
*  Development of a system of participatory monitoring and evaluation, and&#13;
implementation of this system with participating communities, so they can provide&#13;
evaluation data to the project, using their own performance criteria.&#13;
8.    Technical Assistance Studies. For studies, the project will finance a percentage&#13;
of the cost of forest management plans, additional studies to upgrade existing plans,&#13;
studies related to resource conservation, applied forestry research, and studies related to&#13;
organization, administration, marketing and efficiency of forestry enterprises. Forest&#13;
research would be demand-driven, such as establishment of permanent sample plots, and&#13;
carried out by research institutions or consultants at the request of the community. The&#13;
eligibility and specific criteria for the approval of technical assistance are as follows:&#13;

9.    Standardized terms of reference are available for the use of communities in&#13;
preparing technical assistance service proposals. To allow for flexibility, if communities&#13;
want to contract additional studies that are not on the list, then the terms of reference&#13;
would be subject to prior review by the Bank, and the other documentation would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
subject to review according to the project's procurement arrangements for consultants.&#13;
Under no circumstances would this subcomponent finance feasibility studies for&#13;
investment in harvesting or processing equipment. Rather, the tools for carrying out such&#13;
analyses will be given to communities through the training courses. The project will not&#13;
finance any roads-related civil works or engineering studies, although management plans&#13;
and marketing studies might include a discussion of the availability and possible need for&#13;
roads.&#13;
10.   Training. A range of training courses will be developed and offered to&#13;
communities and ejidos on a demand driven basis. A course on environmental impact and&#13;
conservation issues will be required for all communities and ejidos (and private providers)&#13;
requesting technical assistance. Other course topics will include:&#13;
*  silvicultural knowledge&#13;
*  analysis of the contents of a forest management plan&#13;
e  administrative and accounting skills&#13;
-  community/ejido organization&#13;
-  control of fire and insects&#13;
-  market analysis of timber and non-timber products&#13;
3  conservation and environmental impact&#13;
o  technical skills for harvesting and processing&#13;
-  criteria for selecting private providers&#13;
-  forest protection&#13;
o  investment decisions in harvesting and processing equipment and&#13;
&#149;  legal and regulatory norms.&#13;
11.   Funds for training courses include the cost of developing the curriculum and&#13;
training materials, cost per participant of the locale and their residence, if appropriate in&#13;
the site where the course is given, and transportation. Communities have expressed&#13;
concern that heads of household will find it difficult to be away from home overnight,&#13;
because of farm and family responsibilities. A significant number of courses will therefore&#13;
be held close to the participants' communities to address this constraint, even&#13;
programming the courses over a number of Sundays, for example, to allow busy&#13;
householders to attend. The ability of women to attend courses, and ways to make the&#13;
courses attractive to their schedules and interests will also be a task of the promotional&#13;
unit. Participant's counterpart contribution would be the labor lost by attending the&#13;
courses. Two-year tecnica and four-year licenciatura scholarships will also be provided&#13;
for community and ejido members for forestry training.&#13;
12.   A national level component will be included for community-to-community&#13;
seminars to be designed and implemented by ejidos and communities at regional or&#13;
national level. This component is based on the successful experience of a recently&#13;
completed Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant for indigenous forest community&#13;
training, in which workshops were designed and hosted for 40 communities by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
communities with integrated forestry enterprises. Networks or sponsoring communities&#13;
can request funds for study tours, seminars in communities or ejidos with more developed&#13;
forestry enterprises, or for workshops to exchange information and discuss on-going&#13;
issues. As in the case of the IDF grant, funds can be used to invite specialists (both&#13;
community/ejido members and outside professionals) to provide orientation on a particular&#13;
forestry-related subject of interest to the network.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
13.   The Project Implementation Unit in SEMARNAP Oaxaca will have primary&#13;
responsibility for the promotional activities, regional fora and technical assistance. It will&#13;
have staff to promote, implement and monitor the component, including: a coordinator,&#13;
project promoter, four regional promoters, training officer, procurement advisor to&#13;
communities, administrator, and biodiversity advisor.&#13;
14.   NAFIN would handle the payments for community procurement. The Sub&#13;
Delegation of Planning in SEMARNAP Oaxaca would be responsible for designing and&#13;
implementing the training program. For scholarships, the beneficiaries will be nominated&#13;
by their communities, and will be selected by a panel consisting of the SEMARNAP&#13;
Delegate in Oaxaca, the SEMARNAP Oaxaca Sub Delegate of Natural Resources, the&#13;
SEMARNAP Oaxaca Sub Delegate of Planning, the President of the Escuela Tecnica&#13;
Forestal de Santa Maria Atzompa, and the SEDAF Secretary. In the case of community-&#13;
to-community seminars, funds will be awarded on the basis of proposals submitted to the&#13;
Forestry Utilization Division of the Sub Secretariat of Natural Resources in Mexico City&#13;
by networks of ejidos and communities. Representatives of potential recipients of the&#13;
funds would meet with the Forestry Utilization Division to discuss eligibility criteria and&#13;
monitor their implementation.&#13;

COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
Strengthening the Capacity of Private Service Providers&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    The component has the objectives of. (a) broadening the range; (b) increasing the&#13;
quality; and (c) improving the availability of the technical services offered by private providers&#13;
to forest producers, particularly in the State of Oaxaca.&#13;
Background&#13;
Forestry Technical Assistance in Mexico&#13;
2.    In the late 1980s government agencies were responsible for providing technical&#13;
assistance in forestry. However, with the downsizing of federal government budgets in recent&#13;
years most government-financed technical assistance units (most recently called UCODEFOs)&#13;
have been privatized. As a result, most forest land owners must now seek technical services&#13;
from private providers. The provision of forest management technical assistance services to&#13;
forest owners is regulated through Articles 23 and 24 of the Ley Forestal of 1992 and Articles&#13;
31 - 37 of Reglamento de la Ley Forestal in 1994. However, this legislation refers only to&#13;
basic forestry activities including the preparation of forest management programs, harvesting&#13;
plans and timber marking for felling operations. Persons who wish to provide these technical&#13;
services must meet a set of minimum qualifications set out under the Forest Regulations and&#13;
must register themselves with SEMARNAP which records this information in the Registro&#13;
Nacional Forestal. There are at present no registration requirements for the provision of other&#13;
technical services to forest land owners such as business practices, accounting, forest product&#13;
processing, forest product marketing, forest engineering, environmental assessments or related&#13;
studies.&#13;
Forestry Technical Assistance in Oaxaca&#13;
3.    In the project area of Oaxaca there are currently 23 registered private providers - 17&#13;
individuals and 6 companies. The companies employ between 5 and 15 professionals. In&#13;
addition there are an unknown number of unregistered providers of non-traditional forest&#13;
management services. Communities requiring advice can hire providers directly (many&#13;
providers do their own marketing) or they may consult the Registro Nacional Forestal at&#13;
SEMARNAP's Direcci6n General Forestal. Some of the more advanced forest communities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
groups of communities or unions of ejidos, have their own full-time technical forestry&#13;
specialists, but this is beyond the means of most forest producers. In addition to the private&#13;
providers, SEDAF in Oaxaca also operates a limited extension program. Its extension program&#13;
concentrates mainly on nursery management, plantations and forest protection (fire and&#13;
disease).&#13;
Community and Ejido Forest Management in Oaxaca&#13;
4.    According to the Subdelegation of SEMARNAP, approved forest management plans&#13;
in Oaxaca cover an estimated 550,000 hectares while annual cutting plans cover approximately&#13;
20,000 hectares per annum. The cutting cycle varies between 10 and 15 years, with a rotation&#13;
of around 50 years. The average mean annual increment is around 1.5 m3/hectare/annum.&#13;
Around 114 communities produce around 400,000 m3 of logs a year, about 36 percent of the&#13;
permissible cut.&#13;
Markets for Forest Products and Demand for Technical Assistance&#13;
5.    The stumpage value of pine (its standing value), strongly influenced by proximity to&#13;
markets and accessibility, is at present around 110 pesos per m3. Macro-economic factors&#13;
exert an important influence on the demand for timber and related products in Oaxaca. The&#13;
opening of forest product markets to international competition resulted in lower prices for&#13;
imported timber in Oaxaca City in 1994 than for locally harvested timber. The devaluation of&#13;
the peso in early 1995 increased the price of imported timber in peso terms, resulting in&#13;
increased demand for Oaxacan timber, but the accompanying economic downturn dampened&#13;
that demand. Consequently, production of timber in Oaxaca is expected to be lower in 1995&#13;
than in either 1994 or 1993.&#13;
6.    The resulting present lack of liquidity faced by many forest producer communities has&#13;
greatly reduced the demand for technical forestry services. It has also left many forest&#13;
communities indebted to private providers who prepared management plans which cannot be&#13;
implemented because of weak timber markets. In response, the newly privatized providers&#13;
have sharply cut the cost and quality of basic services (e.g., preparation of basic forest&#13;
management plans), in order to compete with other registered providers and "pirate" providers.&#13;
This, coupled with the desire of many communities to simply comply with the legal&#13;
requirement to have a management plan, has resulted in a serious decline in the quality of the&#13;
plans produced. Recently, there has also been a serious reduction in the variety of services&#13;
requested and offered. Many private providers say that where demand for forest technical&#13;
services exists, it is mostly for tree marking, which has to be done in accordance with the&#13;
Annual Felling Plan. Private providers charge 15 pesos/m3 for all activities related to&#13;
compliance with management plans. The cost of preparing a forest management plan is around&#13;
20 to 100 pesos/hectare, with an average cost of 30 pesos/hectare. In some cases the buyer of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
the standing timber may pay the provider costs and deduct it from the selling price, or the&#13;
provider may act as the rniddle man.&#13;
7.    The project is designed to position the government, communities and private providers&#13;
to take advantage of increased demand for forest products and services, and in fact, to help&#13;
generate that demand, by offering improved technical assistance services to the communities&#13;
and making them aware of new production and conservation alternatives to traditional&#13;
methods.&#13;
Roster of Private Providers&#13;
8.    In order to participate in the project, private providers will have to become part of the&#13;
project roster or padron. This process has two stages, a pre-qualification stage and a&#13;
qualification stage.&#13;
9.    Pre-qualification Requirements. At present, the Direcci6n General Forestal&#13;
manages the Registro Nacional Forestal which includes a list of private providers who have&#13;
registered with the Government by providing the following information (As described in Oficio&#13;
510-456/95 051, August 22, 1995).&#13;
For Individual Providers:&#13;
1.    Name of provider of forestry technical services.&#13;
2.    Copy of title and certified copy of professional ID in Forestry Science&#13;
Engineering or related sciences with post-graduate studies in Forestry&#13;
Management.&#13;
3.    Certified copy of Tax Payer ID or Tax Payer Registry.&#13;
4.    Address.&#13;
5.    Three years of professional experience: Curriculum Vitae or documentation&#13;
on professional experience.&#13;
Note: The certification of documents should be done by a notary public.&#13;
For Enterprises:&#13;
1.    Copy of by-laws certified by notary public or Certified Public Register.&#13;
2.    Copy of Tax Payer ID or Tax Payer Registry.&#13;
3.    Address.&#13;
4.    List of employees hired by the enterprise and that have complied with the&#13;
established registration pre-requisites for individuals providing forestry&#13;
technical services, as noted above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
10.   The list of 241 individual private providers and 41 firms in the Registro Nacional&#13;
Forestal will be used as a starting point. The Direcci6n General Forestal will send letters of&#13;
invitation to the private providers that would outline the terms and conditions that would apply&#13;
to activities under the project, and would solicit expressions of interest. At the same time&#13;
efforts would be made to reach private providers who have not registered and to encourage&#13;
them to register in both the Registro Nacional Forestal and the project roster. Once the private&#13;
providers have indicated they wish to participate and agree to the terms outlined in the letter of&#13;
invitation, they would be pre-qualified. The process and qualification requirements would be&#13;
similar for other professionals since rosters exist at NAFIN and other agencies.&#13;
11.   Qualification Requirements. All private providers, traditional and non-traditional,&#13;
wishing to receive project financing to provide technical assistance to project beneficiary&#13;
communities, would be required to attend an orientation seminar of approximately two weeks&#13;
duration. This orientation and immersion program would have the objective of exposing all&#13;
providers to the latest natural resource management techniques for both production and&#13;
conservation as well as the latest techniques for providing effective technical assistance. The&#13;
latter would include review of the latest teaching and extension methods, with special emphasis&#13;
on the participatory aspects of natural resource management. The participants would not be&#13;
expected to be specialists in these subject areas on finishing the course, but rather be aware of&#13;
the disciplines and how they fit into the integrated natural resource management picture. The&#13;
program is also expected to increase the interest of private providers in the more intensive&#13;
continuing education program courses to be offered under the project (see below).&#13;
12.   The program would include the overview courses outlined below, plus a practicum&#13;
period of two or three days in which participants would take field trips to actual forest&#13;
communities and apply their new knowledge in a workshop setting. Attendance at this&#13;
workshop and satisfactory completion of its curriculum, practicum and final exam will be a&#13;
requirement for forestry and non-forestr private providers in order to qualify for project&#13;
financing.&#13;
13.   The program orientation and immersion would include, but not necessarily be limited&#13;
to the following subject areas:&#13;
Project Orientation - This session would describe the project in detail and familiarize&#13;
the private providers with its objectives, components and activities, its institutional&#13;
arrangements, flow of funds and monitoring and evaluations aspects. This will allow&#13;
the private providers to tailor their technical assistance skills to better meet the&#13;
beneficiaries needs and efficiently meet project goals. It would also turn these private&#13;
providers into an additional group of informal project promoters who, familiar with the&#13;
project's design and structure, could help educate forest producers in the project area&#13;
about the overall objectives of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
Forest Management - This session would include: (a) the history of forest&#13;
management in Mexico's pine-oak forests; (b) the different management systems&#13;
currently in use; (c) the latest management techniques being proposed, tested or&#13;
evaluated for use in Mexico's pine-oak forests; and (d) the latest management concepts&#13;
designed to improve the environmental protection and management for multiple use of&#13;
the forest resources including non-timber forest products.&#13;
Forest Administration and Planning - This session would include: (a) inforrnation&#13;
systems, GIS systems, inventories, road planning and layout, cutting schedules; and (b)&#13;
basic administration and control systems to assure efficient forest operations.&#13;
Forest Protection - This session would include basic systems for protecting forest&#13;
areas from fire, insects and diseases. The course would cover detection, control and&#13;
prevention of these forest threats.&#13;
Forest Ecology and Silviculture - This session would look at the management of&#13;
forest areas from an integrated, ecological point of view, seeing the forest as an&#13;
integrated environmental system in which all the organisms within are interconnected&#13;
and interdependent, and in which elements such as water, sols and topography need to&#13;
be taken into consideration before sustainable management plans can be developed.&#13;
Subjects introduced would include: dendrology, forest ecology concepts, ecosystem&#13;
analysis, forest stand dynamics and silvicultural systems.&#13;
Non-Timber Forest Products - This session would provide the participants with a&#13;
background of Mexico's experience with non-timber forest products, including success&#13;
stories, failures and analyses of case histories. The importance of managing forests to&#13;
maximize the returns from non-timber products without sacrificing timber income and&#13;
the need for sound market analyses will be included.&#13;
Environmental Assessment - This session would include: (a) the latest and most cost-&#13;
effective methods of canying out environmental assessments to determine the&#13;
ecological impact of various forest activities including road building and maintenance,&#13;
harvesting, regeneration and extraction of non-timber products; (b) evaluation of the&#13;
ecology of the forest production area, including identification of areas worthy of&#13;
protection and biological survey methods; (c) basic forest management techniques&#13;
aimed at improving biodiversity protection without unduly sacrificing income&#13;
generation and productivity; and (d) a review of current environmental protection&#13;
legislation in Mexico.&#13;
Harvesting, Transport and Primary Manufacturing - The subjects covered in this&#13;
session would include (a) the basics of cost-effective and appropriate technology for&#13;
harvesting, transporting and primary processing of the wood products from Mexico's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
forests; and (b) technical and business aspects of sawmilling and other primary forest&#13;
products industries, including development of feasibility studies for establishing,&#13;
upgrading or expanding industries.&#13;
Social Aspects of Forestry Development--Participation of Local Communities -&#13;
This session will familiarize the participants with the importance of including producer&#13;
community members in the decision making process before drawing up management&#13;
plans for their resource. This will include the concept of "ownership" of the&#13;
management plan and its objectives and assure that the products of that plan will not be&#13;
in conflict with the community's basic economic and social objectives.&#13;
Financial and Economic Analysis and Marketing - This session would cover: (a)&#13;
basic marketing skills and market development, including global market and trade&#13;
issues; (b) basic negotiating skills to determine or bargain for a fair price for products&#13;
sold by the communities; and (c) basic business management skills, including&#13;
accounting, pricing, and development of financial feasibility analysis for all forest&#13;
operations to determine their viability and probable returns on investment.&#13;
Legal and Regulatory Aspects of Forestry - Included in this session would be (a) a&#13;
summary of Mexican forestry legislation and regulations and related laws, including&#13;
explanation of the spirit and letter of this legislation and its implications for the&#13;
communities' forest sector investments and their viability; (b) description and&#13;
explanation of the latest trade and commerce laws with clear explanation of the&#13;
implications for the markets, prices and competitiveness of community forestry&#13;
enterprises; and (c) land tenure, agrarian reform and related legislation.&#13;
14.   As noted above, this immersion program would last two weeks and consist of courses,&#13;
workshops and a two to three day practicum for applying lessons learned to real case studies in&#13;
the field. The program would be offered four times per year in the first two years of the&#13;
project and once or twice a year thereafter depending on demand. It is expected that with a&#13;
capacity of between ten and fifteen students per program, all of Oaxaca's private providers as&#13;
well as a significant number of out-of-state providers would have the opportunity to attend&#13;
and, in doing so, qualify for participation in the project's technical assistance activities.&#13;
Continuing Education Program&#13;
15.   Survey of Private Provider Skills - A team of consultants knowledgeable in&#13;
traditional and non-traditional technical assistance disciplines and familiar with the forestry&#13;
activities of the four community types in Oaxaca, would design and implement a 100 percent&#13;
survey of the private providers in Oaxaca and a sample of out-of-state providers. The purpose&#13;
would be to measure the adequacy of the existing technical assistance services being provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
and the skills that would need to be upgraded in order to satisfy demand from the countries and&#13;
ejidos. The skills that would be assessed would include:&#13;
Traditional: (a) forest land surveys and demarcation; (b) inventories and productivity&#13;
estimating; (c) forest management; (d) forest ecology/silviculture including native forest&#13;
structure and biodiversity, wildlife management; (e) forest engineering; (f) harvesting&#13;
and transport; (g) primary forest products manufacturing; (h) forest protection; (i)&#13;
environmental impact analysis; (j) watershed protection; and (k) integrated natural&#13;
resource management.&#13;
Non-traditional: (a) economic, financial analysis; (b) basic business administration&#13;
and marketing; (c) social forestry/participation; (d) legal and regulatory aspects; and (e)&#13;
non-timber forest products.&#13;
16.   Based on the survey, a continuing education program will be designed to provide in-&#13;
depth coverage of the subject areas that are shown to need upgrading. The program would&#13;
consist of one or two week courses of a post-graduate level quality. In order to continue to&#13;
qualify for participation in project-financed technical assistance programs for the communities,&#13;
private providers would have to attend at least one of these courses each year. Even though&#13;
this requirement would exist, it is expected that the quality, low cost (essentially income&#13;
forgone while attending the courses) and timeliness of the courses would attract private&#13;
providers from Oaxaca and even outside of the state. Four modules of a total duration of 60&#13;
hours and consisting of four to five courses, would be offered each year in years 2 through 5 of&#13;
the project. For private providerfinms, at least one member of their professional staff would be&#13;
required to attend these courses each year.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
17.   The Direcci6n General Forestal's Direcci6n de Aprovechamiento Forestal would be&#13;
responsible for the survey of provider skills and preparation of the project roster. The&#13;
Direcci6n General Forestal and the Sub-Delegation of Planning of SEMARNAP Oaxaca&#13;
would design the orientation and immersion program and the continuing education program.&#13;
The Sub-Delegation of Planning of SEMARNAP Oaxaca would implement the training&#13;
program.&#13;

MEXICO&#13;
COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
Promotion of Non-Timber Forest Products&#13;
I.    Background. As in other countries, information on the extent, use, production and&#13;
economic importance of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in Mexico is incomplete, and&#13;
what is available is widely dispersed and poorly documented. While reliable data is available on&#13;
the production of traditionally traded, NTFPs, such as chicle, mushrooms, resin, orchids,&#13;
asparagus, edible palms, peppers, gladioli bulbs, yuca, nopal, oregano, heno, nogal, honey and&#13;
opuntia, data on non-traditional informally traded NTFPs is virtually non-existent. Examples of&#13;
these include traditional medicines, herbs, edible fruits and seeds, flavorings, fibres, dyes,&#13;
essences, fragrances, and insects.&#13;
2.    The recorded production of NTFPs is highest in the temperate forests (38,000 tons per&#13;
annum), followed by output in the arid/semiarid forrnations (17,500 tons per annum), and the&#13;
tropical moist formations (12,800 tons per annum). However this is not a true reflection of the&#13;
situation because of poor and incomplete recording, the strong influence which resin&#13;
production has on output from temperate forests, and the fact that the data does not include&#13;
non-traded or informally traded NTFPs which are extremely important in some areas. For&#13;
example, some 350,000 tons of NTFPs such as fruits, rhizomes, roots, flowers and bark are&#13;
thought to be traded informally each year, and some 1,200 medicinal plants are thought to be in&#13;
use throughout Mexico. Plants with medicinal potential in Mexico are thought to number&#13;
about 10,000. Given the unreliability of data, it is difficult to estimate the precise monetary&#13;
value of NTFP production, but the Mexico Resource Conservation and Forestry Sector&#13;
Review (Grey Cover Report No. 13114-ME) estimates that the potential annual value of&#13;
NTFP output could be as high as US$ 7 billion.&#13;
3.    Concerning management systems for NTFPs, the general picture seems to be one of&#13;
over-exploitation of a lirnited number of traditional or widely traded products such as chicle,&#13;
resin, orchids and bushmeat, combined with the under-utilisation of lesser-known products.&#13;
The negative impact of the mismanagement of NTFPs manifests itself in three ways. The first&#13;
is one of lost opportunity in that the potential to alleviate rural poverty and improve food&#13;
security is not being realised. The increased use of NTFPs offers potential to generate much&#13;
needed income in rural households and to provide valuable dietary supplements at certain times&#13;
of the year. The second is that the exclusion of NTFPs from forest benefits encourages&#13;
deforestation because forests become undervalued relative to other land uses. An important&#13;
contributory factor to forest conversion has always been its undervaluation, whereby the&#13;
exclusion of values accruing to NTFPs make forests appear to be far less competitive&#13;
forms of land use than agriculture. In some areas, conversion of forest to agriculture has&#13;
resulted in serious land degradation and erosion. A better understanding of the role of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
NTFPs could help reverse this process. The third is that the over-exploitation of selected&#13;
NTFPs may be leading to a loss of biodiversity and environmental degradation.&#13;
4.    Institutional Responsibility. Primary institutional responsibility for NTFPs lies with&#13;
the Direccion General Forestal (DGF) of SEMARNAP which, through the Forestry Law&#13;
(1992) and the Regulations to the Law (1994) is responsible for monitoring and controlling the&#13;
production, transport, and trade in selected NTFPs. In reality, the DGF's capacity to comply&#13;
with its mandate with regard to NTFPs is severely limited because of staff shortages (it has&#13;
only one person assigned to NTFPs at federal level) and budgetary constraints. A change of&#13;
approach is needed whereby the DGF should concentrate its scarce resources on promotional&#13;
activities and the prohibition of exploitation and trade in endangered and protected NTFPs.&#13;
The Instituto Nacional de Ecologia (INE) advises the Procuraduria Federal de Proteccion al&#13;
Ambiente (PFPA) on species identification for subsequent enforcement. The Comission&#13;
Nacional de Aprovechamiento de la Biodiversidad (CONABIO) is responsible for biodiversity&#13;
uses and products.&#13;
5.    Objectives. The objective of this component is to identify, promote and demonstrate&#13;
the market potential and sustainable management of potentially tradable NTFPs.&#13;
6.    Scope. The component would focus its activities in the six priority states with&#13;
pine-oak forests: Oaxaca, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Michoacan and Jalisco. The&#13;
inclusion of additional states would be considered at the time of the project's mid-term&#13;
review.&#13;
7.    To maximize the social and economic impacts of the component, activities will be&#13;
focused on the production and use of potentially tradable NTFPs, which are likely to offer&#13;
more potential for cottage scale development, income generation and poverty alleviation,&#13;
and for which information should be more readily obtained.&#13;
8.    Diagnostic Studies. In the first year of the project, a detailed assessment of formally&#13;
and informally traded NTFPs would be undertaken in each participating state to compile&#13;
information on the extent of the resource base, management systems (if any), annual output,&#13;
processing systems, marketing systems, gender issues (who does what) and prices. The aim&#13;
would be to improve the knowledge base on NTFPs to identify their unrealised potential and to&#13;
identify those which would not be financed through the project because they are threatended&#13;
through bad management and over-exploitation. The work would be carried out by&#13;
consultants and would require one year to complete so as to cover seasonality of supply, at the&#13;
end of which a state-by-state report would be prepared. At the same time, a promotional&#13;
program would be carried out by the SEMARNAP delegations to increase awareness among&#13;
communities of component objectives and activities.&#13;
9.    Grants. After the diagnostic studies are completed, grants would be made to assist&#13;
communities to field-test promising proposals for the development of potentially tradable&#13;
NTFPs. The process would be demand-driven, competitive and transparent whereby&#13;
communities and ejidos (individuals would not be eligible to apply) in participating states would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
be invited to compete for grant funding to help them to develop potentially tradable NTFPs.&#13;
These applications would be competitively appraised (see last section) against clearly defined,&#13;
transparent criteria, which would include:&#13;
Applicant Eligibility&#13;
* only communities and ejidos in the six priority states with pine oak forests, would be eligible&#13;
to apply;&#13;
* communities would not be eligible to receive assistance for more than one project;&#13;
* communities should be legally recognised entities with clear and unencumbered title to their&#13;
forests, and should have an approved management plan for their forests;&#13;
Proposal Eligibility&#13;
* forests with disputed ownership or user rights would be excluded;&#13;
* areas subject to total protection would be excluded;&#13;
3 project proposals should be financially viable;&#13;
- each proposal should be endorsed by the Comisariado of the community submitting the&#13;
proposal;&#13;
3 only one project per product per state would be financed each year, with a maximum of&#13;
three projects per product;&#13;
* consideration would be given to potentially viable activities adjacent to protected area buffer&#13;
zones and to the domestication of overexploited species;&#13;
* certain products may be excluded as a result of the studies undertaken in each state in&#13;
the first year of the project, and will not be eligible;&#13;
3 rare or endangered species listed in either the Convention on International Trade in&#13;
Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora or under Mexican regulations as listed in&#13;
Norma Official Mexicana 059 would be excluded.&#13;
Expenditure Eligibility&#13;
* project proposals should not exceed US$ 20,000;&#13;
* grant disbursement should not exceed two years;&#13;
* eligible expenditure would be limited to tools, materials, field and packaging equipment,&#13;
temporary civil works, technical assistance and limited inputs; labor would be excluded;&#13;
Cost Sharing&#13;
* project funding would to be limited to 75 percent of total project costs, with the community&#13;
being expected to meet the remaining 25 percent in cash or in kind.&#13;
10.   Evaluation of Results. The final step would comprise the monitoring, evaluation,&#13;
publication and dissemination of results and experiences, not only within states but also&#13;
between states where the potential benefits of information transfer can be seen. The evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
process would include a detailed description of methodologies associated with the successful&#13;
harvesting, transport, processing and marketing of the product, together with information on&#13;
costs, returns, and risks. The aim would be to identify and promote success stories so that&#13;
communities in other areas with similar resources could be made aware of the income&#13;
generating potential of NTFPs and the steps that should be taken to realise that potential.&#13;
Failures and the lessons learnt from these experiences would also be highlighted. Further&#13;
studies on NTFP development and an environmental assessment of the further development of&#13;
successful products would be undertaken.&#13;
11.   Implementation Arrangements. DAF would be responsible for overall project&#13;
implementation. DAF would contract and supervise consultants to undertake the diagnostic&#13;
studies.&#13;
12.   As part of the promotional efforts in the project in Oaxaca, communities would be&#13;
given information about the objectives and availability of this program. In the five other states,&#13;
staff at the SEMARNAP delegations would travel to communities to promnote the project.&#13;
Potential applicants would be given assistance in preparing the necessary documentation.&#13;
13.   In Oaxaca, the applications would be sorted by the Project Implementation Unit. In&#13;
other states, the applications would be sorted by the staff at the SEMARNAP delegations and&#13;
submitted to the state level Review Panel, consisting of the SEMARNAP Delegate&#13;
(Chairman), State Forestry Secretary, and a COPLADE Representative (Economist). The&#13;
State Review Panel would meet and make the preliminary selection. The Comisariado would&#13;
be notified immediately.&#13;
14.   All applications approved by the State Review Panels would be sent to the Project&#13;
Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico City for review. Full reports would be prepared&#13;
and submitted to the Federal Review Panel. The Federal Review Panel consisting of the&#13;
SEMARNAP Sub-Secretary of Natural Resources (Chairman), the Director General Forestal,&#13;
and the CONABIO President, would meet and make the election. The State Review Panels&#13;
and the comisariados would be notified immediately. A list of successful applicants and a&#13;
summary of the projects proposed would be made available to all communities. The&#13;
SEMARNAP delegation would enter into an agreement with the selected communities. On&#13;
the basis of the agreement, SEMARNAP would give an advance to the community for the first&#13;
tranche of expenditures as documented in the proposal. Subsequent tranche releases would be&#13;
based on evaluations of physical progress made by SEMARNAP staff. An evaluation would&#13;
be undertaken for all projects after they are completed, and lessons learned would be&#13;
disseminated.&#13;

MEXICO&#13;
COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Strengthening Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    A number of institutions are stakeholders and participants in the design,&#13;
management, and monitoring of the project, including: the SEMARNAP delegation in&#13;
Oaxaca, which includes the Sub-Delegation for Natural Resources, the Sub-Delegation of&#13;
Environment (INE), the Delegation for the Procuraduria Federal de Proteccion al&#13;
Ambiente (PFPA); SEDAF's Forestry Development Department; the COPLADE in&#13;
Oaxaca; and SEMARNAP, INE, and PFPA at federal level. These institutions have a&#13;
direct impact on the development of the forestry sector in Oaxaca and elsewhere in&#13;
Mexico, and on the implementation of the project.&#13;
2.    Two criteria have guided the design of project implementation: to give decision&#13;
making authority and resources to the lowest level possible within the federal-state-&#13;
community structure, so as to capture demand from within the community; and to work as&#13;
much as possible within units that already exist rather than setting up parallel structures,&#13;
so as to ensure sustainability.&#13;
3.    At the time of the establishment of SEMARNAP, the responsibilities for forestry&#13;
activities were transferred from the Secretariat of Agriculture to SEMARNAP, but not all&#13;
of the resources were transferred. As a result, the sector is now severely underfunded,&#13;
especially at the state level. Within SEMARNAP, the emphasis in the sector has shifted&#13;
towards sustainable natural resource management and reduced deforestation, implying the&#13;
need for skills and resources that have not traditionally been strongly represented in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
4.    The objective of this component is to strengthen the federal and state institutions&#13;
working in forestry conservation and development. Specifically, this component would&#13;
strengthen the capacity of. (a) federal institutions to carry out normative and enforcement&#13;
activities that have a direct impact on community forestry; (b) state government&#13;
institutions in preparation for the eventual decentralization of resources and&#13;
responsibilities; (c) project management and implementation units to implement, monitor,&#13;
and evaluate the project; and (d) federal and state institutions to monitor the pilot&#13;
activities in Oaxaca, and prepare similar projects in the five priority states with pine-oak&#13;
forests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Description&#13;
5.    This component would have the following sub-components: (a) strengthening the&#13;
review of forestry management and conservation plans; (b) strengthening SEMARNAP&#13;
delegations and state secretariats; (c) establishing a Sistema Nacional de Informacion&#13;
Forestal and a Registro Nacional Forestal; (d) upgrading staff skills; (e) establishing two&#13;
project management units; (f) and preparing similar projects in five other priority states&#13;
with pine-oak forests, based on the experiences in Oaxaca.&#13;
(a)   Review of Forestry Management and Conservation Plans. This sub-&#13;
component would finance consultants, salaries, field and computer equipment,&#13;
vehicles, and operating expenditures to strengthen the review, approval, and audit&#13;
of forestry management and conservation plans by SEMARNAP in Oaxaca.&#13;
Forestry communities and ejidos are mandated by law to prepare forestry&#13;
management plans. These plans are prepared by private providers, and cover five&#13;
to ten years of activity. The plans include information such as location and&#13;
quantification of the forestry resources, general physical and biological description&#13;
of the resource base, annual cutting plans describing the species, volumes and&#13;
expected productivity, description of the silvicultural system, conservation plans,&#13;
fire prevention and control, environmental impact analysis, reforestation, and&#13;
infrastructural requirements. In the temperate zone, the inclusion of activities such&#13;
as road building would require a separate environmental assessment. The benefits&#13;
that are likely to result from well produced forestry management plans include&#13;
better forest management which would lead to sustained, increased income flows&#13;
and improved environmental management and protection.&#13;
Since 1992, the review and approval of forestry management plans has been&#13;
delegated to the federal delegations at state level. Since the reorganization of&#13;
government agencies, these activities now fall to SEMARNAP. Within the&#13;
SEMARNAP delegation, four units review or audit management plans. The&#13;
Subdelegation of Natural Resources affiliated with the Direccion General Forestal,&#13;
is in charge of the process, with inputs from the other units, and issues the&#13;
'dictamen' indicating that it has either approved the plan, suggested mitigating&#13;
measures, or requested more information. The Subdelegation of Environment&#13;
affiliated with INE, reviews the plan for its environmental impact. The Judicial&#13;
Unit reviews the plans to make sure the areas covered by the plan are not under&#13;
dispute since disputed areas are left out of management plans. Once the plans have&#13;
been approved and the activities have been completed, the PFPA Delegation audits&#13;
the plan and its implementation, using satellite imagery and reports of the grupos&#13;
de vigilancia to focus on problem areas. When it encounters problems it imposes&#13;
fines and sanctions on the private provider and the community, as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
In 1994 - 1995, 190 forestry management plans for temperate areas were prepared&#13;
and approved in Oaxaca, covering about 400 cutting permits. About 60 to 70&#13;
percent of the forestry management plans are either approved or approved with&#13;
suggested mitigating measures after the first review. About a dozen were found to&#13;
have problems after the audit was completed.&#13;
At present in Oaxaca, the plans are tracked manually, and are often difficult to&#13;
locate. The reduction in staff as a result of the transfer of responsibilities to&#13;
SEMARNAP has created bottlenecks and delays in plan review and approval.&#13;
More staff, with better skills, are needed in the SEMARNAP delegation in Oaxaca.&#13;
In theory, the findings of the auditors would feed back into the approval process,&#13;
so that private providers that had been put on probation would not be able to&#13;
submit plans, and communities that had been fined would be more carefully&#13;
monitored. In practice, the review and approval process is not linked to the audit&#13;
process, requiring the creation of a computerized information management system&#13;
to track each plan, and to link the review, approval, and audit findings.&#13;
(b)   SEMARNAP Delegations and State Secretariats. This sub-component would&#13;
finance equipment, staff, and operating expenses to strengthen the SEMARNAP&#13;
delegations and the State Secretariats in the five other priority states with pine-oak&#13;
forests. SEMARNAP is in the process of planning the deconcentration of&#13;
resources and responsibilities from the federal level to the state delegations,&#13;
followed by the decentralization of resources and responsibilities to the State&#13;
Secretariats.&#13;
(c)   Sistema Nacional de Informacion Forestal (SNIF). This sub-component would&#13;
finance consultants to design an Internet based system that would enable private&#13;
producers, academics, non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and&#13;
others, to access Government information and to create their own databases within&#13;
the system.&#13;
An attempt in the previous administration to establish a national information&#13;
system for the use of government agencies, that would contain government-&#13;
collected data was aborted with the transfer of responsibilities for forestry from the&#13;
Secretariat of Agriculture to SEMARNAP. This current proposal is significantly&#13;
different from the previous proposal in that it reflects the new outlook in the&#13;
administration towards information sharing with all groups within the society. The&#13;
SNIF will be an Internet-based system that would enable private producers,&#13;
academics, non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and others to&#13;
access the information, and to create their own databases within the system.&#13;
As part of the SNIF, the Registro Nacional Forestal would be computerized.&#13;
The Registro is a public register of all the activities that are regulated by the&#13;
Government. At present, the Registro includes a roster of certified private&#13;
providers of forestry services, the approved forestry management plans, cutting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
permits, forestry enterprise permits, approved changes in land use, and the forestry&#13;
inventory. The Registro is not computerized, and the data can only be accessed by&#13;
visiting the office at the Direccion General Forestal in Mexico City, therefore this&#13;
sub-component would also finance computer hardware and software, terminals at&#13;
all the state delegations, system administration staff, and maintenance.&#13;
(d)   Skills Upgrading. This sub-component would finance consultants, course&#13;
materials, facilities, instructors' fees and travel-related expenses, for skills&#13;
upgrading through training and scholarships for staff at the federal level, and state&#13;
level in the six priority states with pine-oak forests. Selected staff would attend&#13;
the technical forestry training courses designed for the private providers. Some&#13;
training programs would be designed to upgrade administrative and technology&#13;
skills. Scholarships for two year courses and study tours would be available on a&#13;
limited basis.&#13;
(e)   Project Management and Implementation Units. This sub-component would&#13;
finance two units: a Project Management Unit at SEMARNAP in Mexico City&#13;
reporting to the Director General of DGF, and including: sufficient qualified staff&#13;
such as a coordinator, procurement specialist, technical expert, liaison with&#13;
Oaxaca; equipment; studies; travel-related expenses; and operating expenses; and a&#13;
Project Implementation at SEMARNAP in Oaxaca reporting to the SEMARNAP&#13;
Delegate in Oaxaca, including: sufficient qualified staff such as a coordinator,&#13;
administrator, project promoter, four regional promoters, training officer,&#13;
procurement advisor to communities, biodiversity advisor; equipment; studies;&#13;
travel-related expenses; and operating expenses.&#13;
The Project Management Unit at SEMARNAP in Mexico City will be responsible&#13;
for guiding project implementation through annual planning, budgeting, and&#13;
reporting. It will be the liaison between the different agencies involved in the&#13;
project, including SEMARNAP Oaxaca, CONAF, NAFIN, SHCP, and the World&#13;
Bank. The Project Management Unit will perform secretariat functions for the&#13;
grant and scholarship selection panels at federal level. It will assist with, and when&#13;
necessary perform, project accounting, procurement, and disbursement functions.&#13;
It will have primary responsibility for project supervision, monitoring of project&#13;
activities, monitoring of the status of deforestation and forestry-based income in&#13;
Oaxaca, and evaluation of project implementation.&#13;
The Project Implementation Unit in SEMARNAP Oaxaca will serve as the primary&#13;
point of contact in Oaxaca for the communities, private providers, and agencies&#13;
involved in the project. It would be involved in monitoring project activities in&#13;
Oaxaca, and would also have responsibility for: (a) Assistance to Communities and&#13;
Ejidos - promotional activities, regional units, coordination and implementation of&#13;
community procurement for technical assistance; (c) Promotion of NTFP -&#13;
monitoring of grant activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
(f)   Project Preparation in Five Priority States. This sub-component would finance&#13;
consultants, travel-related expenses, and workshops to prepare projects in the five&#13;
other priority states with pine-oak forests: Chihuahua, Durango, Michoacan,&#13;
Jalisco, and Guerrero. This project is piloting an approach to working with&#13;
communities and ejidos to improve their management of forestry resources.&#13;
SEMARNAP would evaluate the experience in Oaxaca, and extend the approach&#13;
to other states, possibly with the support of Bank financed projects.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
6.    SEMARNAP Oaxaca will be responsible for implementing the review and&#13;
enforcement of the forestry management plans, with assistance as necessary from the&#13;
Direccion de Aprovechamiento Forestal (DAF). CONAF will be responsible for&#13;
strengthening the SEMARNAP delegations and the State Secretariats in the five other&#13;
priority states with pine-oak forest, and for project preparation in collaboration with them.&#13;
CONAF will also be responsible for designing and implementing the SNIF, in consultation&#13;
with DAF on the Registro Nacional Forestal. DAF will manage the Registro Nacional&#13;
Forestal. Designing and implementing skills upgrading programs for government staff will&#13;
be the responsibility of DAF in collaboration with SEMARNAP Oaxaca's Sub-Delegation&#13;
of Planning. An Advisory Committee consisting of six Directors General from&#13;
SEMARNAP will approve staff scholarships and study tours.&#13;

MEXICO&#13;
COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
Project Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting&#13;
1.    This project is piloting several innovative activities in the forestry sector in&#13;
Mexico, including demand driven technical assistance and training and grant based non-&#13;
timber forest product management. If successful, the project would be replicated in other&#13;
priority states with pine-oak forests. Therefore systematic and accurate reporting and&#13;
active monitoring is essential to track project performance and make adjustments to&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
2.    Six indicators have been selected against which successful implementation would&#13;
be measured: (a) annual budgetary allocation; (b) increased forest area under improved&#13;
management; (c) hectares under conservation by communities; (d) number of private&#13;
providers in the project roster; (e) number of non-timber forest products successfully&#13;
implemented; and (f) percentage of management plans reviewed within the legally&#13;
mandated 30 day limit.&#13;
3.    The Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico City would have primary&#13;
responsibility for project supervision, monitoring and evaluation. It would be responsible&#13;
for guiding project implementation through annual planning, budgeting, and reporting.&#13;
Each agency would have the responsibility of monitoring the activities within their&#13;
mandate, and reporting to the Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico City&#13;
on a quarterly basis. The Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico City&#13;
would consolidate and distribute internal quarterly reports measuring progress against&#13;
indicators, and would prepare an annual Project Implementation Report. Based on this&#13;
Project Implementation Report, the Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico&#13;
City would prepare an Annual Operating Plan and Implementation Schedule, which would&#13;
be discussed and agreed with the Bank.&#13;
4.    In order to permit effective monitoring of the environment within which the project&#13;
operates, the Project Management Unit in SEMARNAP in Mexico City would supervise&#13;
two studies: the first would consist of periodic surveys of deforestation in Oaxaca, aided&#13;
by aerial photography; and the second would consist of periodic surveys of forestry-&#13;
related community income in Oaxaca.&#13;
5.    The internal quarterly reports, which would be made available to Bank supervision&#13;
missions as requested, would focus on evaluations of progress against the attached&#13;
implementation indicators agreed to in the Annual Operating Plan. They are designed to&#13;
be used by the Government as an effective tool for project monitoring.&#13;

MEXICO&#13;
COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
Social Assessment and Participation Plan&#13;
Objectives and Scope&#13;
1.    Project preparation has included a process of social assessment and preparation of&#13;
a participation plan, with special emphasis on indigenous development given that more&#13;
than 90 percent of the targeted project beneficiaries belong to indigenous ethnicities. The&#13;
social assessment includes five stages or elements: (a) a country-level sector analysis for&#13;
which social issues comprised a significant part of the work/program (Gray Cover&#13;
"Resource Conservation and Forestry Sector Review," Report No. 13114-ME) and the&#13;
state of Oaxaca was a case-study site; (b) an indigenous peoples development assessment&#13;
by a renowned Mexican anthropologist resident in Oaxaca; (c) the recommendations made&#13;
by 40 indigenous forest ejidos and communities in three ejido-to-ejido training workshops&#13;
on forestry financed through an Institutional Development Fund Grant; (d) focus group&#13;
interviews with indigenous forest owners, industrialists, federal and state government&#13;
forest officials, and private forest technicians; and (e) a series of regional consultations&#13;
with indigenous ejidos and communities during the pre- evaluation phase. The process&#13;
aims to: (a) identify social issues important for project design, including the choice of&#13;
institutional arrangements; (b) collect information regarding felt needs of the target&#13;
population; (c) identify potential negative social aspects and design mitigating measures to&#13;
address those impacts; and (d) initiate the process of participation that will be continued&#13;
during project implementation.&#13;
A Profile of Project Beneficiaries&#13;
2.    The project area is coterminous with the temperate forest areas of Oaxaca--&#13;
concentrated in the Sierra Norte, Sierra Juarez, Sierra del Sur, and parts of the central&#13;
valleys. There are between 1300 and 1500 ejidos and indigenous communities in Oaxaca,&#13;
of which an estimated 40 percent have temperate forest holdings within their boundaries.&#13;
Estimates are that ejidos total between 700 and 730 and communities between 570 and&#13;
750 in number. About 280 ejidos and communities are estimated to have significant&#13;
temperate and tropical forest holdings large enough to warrant commercial exploitation.&#13;
The majority of the population (eight ejidos and 228 communities) with temperate forests&#13;
are indigenous and include six of the sixteen indigenous ethnicity's of Oaxaca, namely the&#13;
Zapoteca, Mixteca, Nahuatl, Cuicateco, Chinanteca, and Mixe. A significant number of&#13;
the indigenous population are bilingual speakers of their own language and Spanish,&#13;
although some communities no longer use their language of origin. Because of the&#13;
mountainous terrain and limited road networks, some communities are physically isolated&#13;
and speak distinct dialects that are not readily understood by members of the same ethnic&#13;
group form other parts of the region. There is a significant degree of poverty and&#13;
marginality in the municipalities covered by the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
3.    Political Systems and Local Government. The indigenous groups have&#13;
maintained their traditional political structures to a large extent. The indigenous&#13;
communities elect leaders known as Comisariados de Bienes Comunales for a period&#13;
ranging from one to three years. The communities and ejidos are grouped into 570&#13;
municipalities state-wide, some with as few as three communities or ejidos and presided by&#13;
municipal presidents. Oaxaca underwent municipal elections in November, 1995, and&#13;
municipal presidents took office in January 1996. In addition to the elected officials, each&#13;
community has indigenous religious and cultural leaders who are consulted according to&#13;
traditions of individual ethnic groups. There is a significant migration from Zapoteca and&#13;
Mixteca to urban centers and the United States, but community members (comuneros) can&#13;
retain their voting rights.&#13;
Patterns of Forest Management and Organization for Production&#13;
4.    There is a wide range of community organization for forestry management and&#13;
production in the temperate forest areas of the state. There are four categories of forest&#13;
organizations, based on patterns of forest production: (a) communities that do not have&#13;
management plans; (b) communities with management plans who do not sell wood; (c)&#13;
communities with management plans who only sell stumpage; and (d) communities that&#13;
have some industrial capacity. Some of these latter communities are organized into unions&#13;
for technical assistance and marketing. These categories are filtered through social&#13;
characteristics of the communities. Indigenous ejidos and communities place a high value&#13;
on gaining social as well as economic benefits from their forest management. This has&#13;
had both positive and negative impacts on organizational efforts. Traditionally,&#13;
communities make decisions in highly democratic fashion and there is a frequent change of&#13;
elected leadership to encourage greater rotation of leadership positions. This can be a&#13;
strength of community forestry, but can also lead to a lack of professionalism in forest&#13;
resource management, if there is too much rotation of comuneros responsible for&#13;
managing the community forestry enterprise. The most developed forest communities&#13;
have sent community youth to be trained in forestry, to return to provide technical services&#13;
to their community.&#13;
5.    Social goals are important to many indigenous ejidos. Unlike non-indigenous&#13;
forest ejidos, indigenous ejidos and communities assign a significant part of the earnings&#13;
from timber sales to finance social goods, such as schools, feeder roads, health centers,&#13;
and water supply. There is a range of variation in the importance placed on these goals by&#13;
different communities. In general, these goals take precedence over long-term investment&#13;
in the forestry enterprise. Some communities are reluctant to exploit their forest resources&#13;
for fear of causing ecological damage (seen in a somewhat spiritual sense) and/or for fear&#13;
of creating social conflicts due to the inability to allocate the earnings in an equitable and&#13;
socially-acceptable way. Rotation of forestry enterprise workers is one mechanism used&#13;
by communities who exploit their forests as a way of equitably distributing opportunities&#13;
created by forestry, even when it is recognized that this limits professional development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
6.    Cultural values include traditional identification with a number of sacred and&#13;
cultural heritage sites within the forested areas. In the case of communities with forest&#13;
management plans, under the revisions to the agrarian reform law made in the late 1980s,&#13;
communities' cultural sovereignty has been recognized to a greater extent in the country.&#13;
Expression of this is found in the communal statutes, formal expressions of communal&#13;
customary laws and traditions. In Oaxaca, communities that have prepared such statutes&#13;
have included descriptions of their cultural values towards natural resources, descriptions&#13;
of land tenure boundaries and rights, and descriptions of their management plans for their&#13;
forest resource base. This can be a valuable record for ensuring that community cultural&#13;
values are upheld in forest management plans and to formally protect a community's right&#13;
to allocate resojirces according to the decisions of traditionally selected leaders, rather&#13;
than those elected through the formal political process or appointed by the government.&#13;
Key Issues for Project Design&#13;
7.    Indigenous Cultural Values and Forest Management  Forest management&#13;
plans are designed to promote integrated forest management which is culturally&#13;
appropriate to local social and cultural values. The studies to be financed under the&#13;
project will include an integrated approach, including the identification and preservation of&#13;
cultural sites. Training courses will also include attention to cultural issues in forest&#13;
management in both courses for the communities and courses for private providers. In the&#13;
course curriculum designed for scholarship courses to be given to indigenous community&#13;
members in Oaxaca, this topic will be explored and integrated.&#13;
8.    Indigenous Institutions and Forestry/Conservation  If forestry ejidos and&#13;
communities are to advance in the levels of control over resource management decisions&#13;
and efficiency of forestry enterprises, there will need to be considerable trust created in the&#13;
management of the technical assistance and training component and adequate participation&#13;
by indigenous leaders and forest managers. There is a strong perception by indigenous&#13;
groups in Oaxaca that government and some non-governmental organizations providing&#13;
technical support are paternalistic and undervalue the indigenous world view and cultural&#13;
system. This is a real barrier to the ability of the project to introduce a forest culture to a&#13;
significant number of communities.&#13;
9.    Increases in forest income and efficiency and sophistication of the forestry&#13;
enterprise also result in significant changes in community life that require a social&#13;
adaptation. While many communities seek these changes, they also recognize that there&#13;
will be some painful adjustments required. Training and promotional staff of the project&#13;
must be aware of this process and seek measures to make the transition easier. It should&#13;
also be expected that there will be serious resistance to these changes in some&#13;
communities and that progress towards a highly productive enterprise is unlikely to be&#13;
without lapses or backtracking. Communities with their own technical service providers&#13;
have an advantage in that they are more likely to recognize these dynamics and help&#13;
community leaders to find solutions. Training of non-indigenous, private providers would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
also benefit from modules that make them more aware of and respectful of these&#13;
dynamics.&#13;
10.   Land Tenure and Boundary Conflicts  The land reform process in Mexico&#13;
divided agricultural lands into private, ejido, and indigenous community holdings. Ejidos&#13;
are land reform blocks which include groups of farmers, their individual agricultural&#13;
parcels, and common grazing and forest lands and residential infrastructure. Communities&#13;
are extensions of terrain traditionally used by specific indigenous populations, which have&#13;
their own system of internal government. In 1992, the Government introduced reforms to&#13;
the Agrarian Law and references to it in Article 27 of the National Constitution. As an&#13;
incentive for greater investment in ejido lands and to land security, the opportunity was&#13;
created for ejidos to privatize and request titles to individual parcels or, alternately, to&#13;
regularize the boundaries of the ejido and of the individual parcels within the ejido.&#13;
Indigenous communities were given the opportunity to convert to ejidos and indigenous&#13;
ejidos were given the option of converting to communities. A program of technical&#13;
assistance for the regularization process for ejidos was created in 1993 called Programa&#13;
de Certificacion de Derechos Ejidalesy Titulacion de Solares Urbanos (PROCEDE).&#13;
Under this program, the Procuraduria Agraria initiated a program of legal assistance in&#13;
cooperation with the other land agencies, the Ministry of Land Reform (SRA), the&#13;
National Registry (RAN), and the National Statistics and Geographic Institute (INEGI).&#13;
Overall, the program has been more active in productive agricultural areas and peri-urban&#13;
areas, than in the more marginal and remote forested areas.&#13;
11.   PROCEDE has been initiated in the majority of ejidos in Oaxaca. At present, 115&#13;
of the ejidos that have entered into the process of regularization are stuck in various stages&#13;
due to the presence of unresolvable boundary conflicts. There are 350 cases of registered&#13;
boundary conflicts within ejidos, and between ejidos and communities. Of the 1 17&#13;
communities and ejidos for which PROCEDE data exist, 52 percent have some form of&#13;
conflict and 8 percent lack clear documentation of their land rights (rezago agraria). In&#13;
most cases boundary conflicts do not affect forest exploitation as management plans&#13;
simply exclude those areas in conflict. These conflicts only affect forest enterprises should&#13;
the community seek to access formal credit to capitalize their industry or to enter a joint&#13;
venture where the bank or investor want land security.&#13;
12.  In consultations with the land agencies involved in PROCEDE, particularly in&#13;
dialogues with the anthropologist director of the Ministry of Land Reform, and the&#13;
director and the staff of the office of the Procuraduria Agraria in Oaxaca, the&#13;
recommendation has been made that the project include training activities that help forest&#13;
ejidos and communities with conflicts to resolve them. Given the complicated legal nature&#13;
of many of the disputes, the PROCEDE agencies have recommended against including any&#13;
informal conciliation process in the technical assistance component. Instead, they have&#13;
identified the need for a basic level of training to ejidos and communities which informs&#13;
them about the process of legal adjudication and provides them with detailed information&#13;
about the different steps in the process of regularization where conflicts are involved. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
possibility of extending a pilot training program, which has been tested elsewhere in&#13;
Mexico, to the state of Oaxaca is being evaluated.&#13;
Participation in Project Planning and Implementation&#13;
13.   The project has been designed to address the felt needs of the indigenous forest&#13;
ejidos and communities in Oaxaca as well as provide a model for expansion to other states&#13;
with indigenous and non-indigenous community and ejido forest owners. Oaxaca was&#13;
chosen as a site for the pilot because of the interest of target beneficiaries and state&#13;
government in forestry development and resource management and because it was the&#13;
most promising state included in the cases analyzed in the sector review, in terms of the&#13;
degree of organization of forest ejidos and communities. The project is a technical&#13;
assistance project which is designed on the premise that there are a significant number of&#13;
forest ejidos and communities that can take control of the conservation and development&#13;
of their natural resource base, leading to better resource management and greater&#13;
generation of income from forestry and conservation activities. The project plans to pilot&#13;
a series of mechanisms for technical assistance and training that were identified during the&#13;
sector reviews as beneficial to communal forestry. It is expected that, as technical&#13;
assistance experience is gained and as community enterprises evolve, communities in&#13;
Oaxaca will be able to absorb more diverse technical assistance for development of more&#13;
sophisticated and higher-value forest enterprises.&#13;
Ejido to Ejido/Community to Community Seminars&#13;
14.   In FY95, the Bank financed an IDF grant for ejido-to-ejido training by indigenous&#13;
forest ejidos, which was administered through NAFIN. In two workshops, indigenous&#13;
forest owners attended courses at two of the more successful ejidos which included&#13;
modules in which participants outlined development strategies and areas requiring&#13;
technical assistance and financial support. These workshops were followed by a third&#13;
evaluation workshop in which participants proposed that regional training networks be&#13;
established and funds made available to indigenous ejidos and communities for continued&#13;
training. A second IDF is under preparation which is intended to help the ejidos and&#13;
communities set up the proposed networks and these regional ejido-to-ejido training&#13;
methods. The project includes ejido to ejido training within the training component. This&#13;
activity is planned on a national level, given the strong interest expressed by indigenous&#13;
ejidos and communities during the first IDF and through other forest networks, and the&#13;
strong capacity demonstrated by the groups to manage their own training process. SHCP&#13;
has expressed interest in continuing to channel such resources through NAFIN.&#13;
Other Training Initiatives&#13;
15.  In addition to the above-mentioned training, the project would include short and&#13;
long-term training for ejido and community members. Short term training would attempt&#13;
to inform a broad base of community members about the range and quality of technical&#13;
services that they should be able to utilize for forest management plan preparation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
forest management and extraction decisions. In addition, short-term training would&#13;
transfer administrative and accounting skills which are key to a community or ejido's&#13;
ability to manage a forestry enterprise and maximize its returns. Scholarships would be&#13;
provided for long-term training of community and ejido members in Oaxaca. While it&#13;
would not be appropriate for the project to finance the development of curricula at the&#13;
forestry school in Oaxaca, the government is exploring possible development of a&#13;
curriculum more geared to the needs of the indigenous students.&#13;
Regional Fora&#13;
16.   The project will include the development of regional fora in the five or six&#13;
subregions of the project area. These fora will provide an opportunity for communities to&#13;
meet collectively to discuss project issues and opportunities, a space for learning about&#13;
technical assistance and training options, and a space to exchange opinions about the&#13;
progress of the project and to channel information about their interests and needs to&#13;
project staff Initially, the promotional unit of the Project Management Unit in&#13;
SEMARNAP in Oaxaca will request local leaders to call meetings of the regional fora and&#13;
provide suggestions on agenda topics. With time, it is hoped that these fora will be&#13;
managed actively by local communities. It is not intended that these provide formal&#13;
representation of communities and their leaders for forestry issues. It is possible,&#13;
however, that over time, the communities within the region will begin to develop such&#13;
formal representation to provide a stronger lobby for regional interests at state level.&#13;

COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
Project Design Options&#13;
1.    During project preparation, several options for project design were considered&#13;
which were consistent with the constraint analysis that had been undertaken jointly by the&#13;
Government and the Bank as part of the Mexico Resource Conservation and Forestry&#13;
Sector Review (Grey Cover Report No. 13114-NW; March 31, 1995).&#13;
2.    Early discussions between the Government and the Bank envisaged a project that&#13;
would include community forestry and protected areas management in two of the six&#13;
priority states with pine-oak forests. Oaxaca and Michoacan were initially chosen because&#13;
both states had: well organized forestry communities and ejidos; important forestry&#13;
resources, including pine-oak forests with commercial potential; high biodiversity within&#13;
the forestry areas under community and ejido management; experience by communities&#13;
with private providers of forestry services, which could be further developed; and&#13;
successful sustainable use of some non-timber forest products.&#13;
3.    After discussions in Mexico, it became clear that there was strong institutional&#13;
support for the community forestry activities, and that those activities could move ahead&#13;
more rapidly. There was, however, less support for protected areas management&#13;
activities. Within the Bank, the options were evaluated at the project concept stage using&#13;
criteria including: complexity, ownership by the implementing agency, institutional&#13;
capacity, community decision making, cost-effectiveness, and likely sustainability. The&#13;
results can be summarized as follows:&#13;

4.    Based on these results, and further discussions with the Government, Oaxaca was&#13;
chosen as the project location. The constraints to forestry development discussed in the&#13;
Sector Review were analyzed to see their applicability to Oaxaca. The results of these&#13;

            Mexico - Community Forestry Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Community
            Forestry Project is to support the implementation of key
            elements in the Government's redefined natural resource
            management strategy. Specific objectives are to: (1) improve
            natural resource management and conservation by community
            and ejido forestry resource owners; and (2) increase the
            range of forestry-based income generating options available
            to them. The project will have four components: (1)To assist
            Oaxaca's communities and ejidos (land grants for legal
            use and enjoyment that, prior to 1992 constitutional
            reforms, were state-owned and could not be sold) by
            financing activities, assistance, and training to prepare
            and update management plans for timber extraction; to
            prepare conservation plans for forested areas; to integrate
            resource management and forestry research; to develop
            silvicultural skills, and control fire and insects; to
            understand boundary conflict issues; to access credit,
            markets, and technologies; to increase the efficiency of
            forestry activities and enterprises, and to improve business
            and management, especially financial management skills. (2)
            To strengthen the capacity of Oaxaca's private service
            providers to assist communities and ejidos, and finance
            consultants and equipment needed to review and strengthen
            the government's certification and evaluation program
            for private sector providers. (3) To promote non-timber
            forest products in the six priority states with pine-oak
            forest by financing studies, grants, salaries, consultants,
            equipment, materials, and publications. (4) providing
            finance to strengthen state forestry institutions in five
            priority states with pine-oak forest.
