&amp;#12;                                    SUMMARY&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) hosted a consultative workshop in Durban,&#13;
South Africa from February 21-22, 2008 to develop a sanitation behavior change&#13;
framework. The workshop was attended by 27 participants from organizations working&#13;
to improve sanitation globally.&#13;
&#13;
The framework is intended to help practitioners:&#13;
   - understand consumer needs and wants,&#13;
   - behavior change objectives in a given setting,&#13;
   - inform research,&#13;
   - improve monitoring and evaluation designs, and&#13;
   - engage and supervise consultants when implementing sanitation behavior change&#13;
       programs.&#13;
   This framework can also be incorporated into other models and frameworks being&#13;
   used in sanitation such as Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation (PHAST).&#13;
&#13;
The workshop had three broad objectives:&#13;
&#13;
   1) Review determinants of sanitation behavior&#13;
&#13;
   2) Develop a framework for sanitation behavior change&#13;
&#13;
   3) Determine how to operationalize the framework&#13;
&#13;
The active involvement of participants was a key factor in achieving the stated workshop&#13;
objectives. The participants developed a common language of behavior change&#13;
terminology and worked together to develop a sanitation behavior change framework&#13;
                                           1&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;called -SaniFOAM. Both participants and the facilitators thought the workshop was a&#13;
success.&#13;
&#13;
WSP will use the participantsâ&#128;&#153; inputs and workshop proceedings to refine the framework&#13;
and produce an operational guide on its use. This will include specific guidance on&#13;
formative research and various aspects of program implementation.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, a format for workshops will be developed for country sanitation stakeholders&#13;
to apply SaniFOAM. With these tools, WSP hopes to help practitioners design,&#13;
implement, and monitor behavior change activities in sanitation interventions.&#13;

&amp;#12;INTRODUCTION&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), which is administered by the World Bank,&#13;
received funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to implement the Global&#13;
Scaling Up Sanitation Project (TSSM) in Indonesia, India, and Tanzania. This project is&#13;
testing new approaches to generate sanitation demand at scale and increase the supply of&#13;
sanitation products and services resulting in increased access to hygienic sanitation and&#13;
improved health for poor households and communities in rural villages, small towns, and&#13;
informal urban settlements.&#13;
&#13;
The SaniFOAM workshop grew out of the need for the TSSM project team to better&#13;
understand the determinants of sanitation behavior and to develop a behavior change&#13;
framework that could be applied to improve demand and supply side interventions of the&#13;
project. A critical component of the project is to carry out a structured learning process&#13;
to develop practical knowledge and tools for effective replication and scaling up of future&#13;
programs in other countries, and a BCF was identified as one of those tools.&#13;
&#13;
The sanitation behavior change framework (BCF) helps to understand the benefits and&#13;
costs to individuals of moving up or down the sanitation ladder, or maintaining their&#13;
position once improved sanitation has been reached. The BCF allows sanitation&#13;
professionals to look through the lens of the people they are trying to serve and see, from&#13;
their perspective. The opportunities, abilities, and motivations to improve their sanitation&#13;
facility. It also allows sanitation professionals to strengthen formative research,&#13;
interventions, and monitoring and evaluation systems.&#13;
&#13;
The BCF developed in this workshop builds on existing behavior change models and&#13;
frameworks that are used by the sector such as PHAST, WASH, and SARAR; and within&#13;
public health, such as the Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, Diffusion of&#13;
Innovation, and Stages of Change. The workshop included participants from a range of&#13;
backgrounds (engineering, public health, social sciences) representing six different&#13;
organizations and 12 countries.&#13;
&#13;
The workshop was held in Durban, South Africa from February 21-22, 2008 following&#13;
the AfricaSan Conference. (AfricaSan convened thirty countries in Africa and focused on&#13;
the current state of sanitation on the continent.)&#13;
&#13;
The workshopâ&#128;&#153;s objectives were to:&#13;
   1. Review determinants of sanitation behavior&#13;
   2. Develop a framework for sanitation behavior change&#13;
   3. Determine how to operationalize the framework&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;DEVELOPING THE BEHAVIOR CHANGE FRAMEWORK&#13;
In 2007, WSP held a series of workshops to develop a behavior change framework for&#13;
handwashing. These lessons and experience helped inform the design of the SaniFOAM&#13;
workshop. Sessions at the SaniFOAM workshop included: a review of behavior change&#13;
models, frameworks, and concepts; and a discussion on behavior change theory so&#13;
participants would have a common vocabulary. These sessions were followed by&#13;
participant presentations and group work to immerse the participants in the BCF and&#13;
understand the determinants of sanitation behavior. The last sessions focused on how to&#13;
apply the BCF.&#13;
&#13;
Step 1: Review of Sanitation and Behavior Change&#13;
Participants formed teams and were asked to come up with a team name and logo. Each&#13;
team was asked to define one of the following terms: sanitation marketing, marketing,&#13;
social marketing, and Community Led Total Sanitation. The purpose of this exercise was&#13;
to ensure a shared understanding of the definitions among all participants. The following&#13;
definitions were agreed upon:&#13;
&#13;
Social Marketing: The systematic application of marketing techniques to achieve&#13;
behavioral goals for a social good.&#13;
&#13;
Marketing: Understanding and meeting consumerâ&#128;&#153;s needs through an exchange process.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation Marketing: Involves increasing demand and adaptation of sanitation goods,&#13;
services, ideas, and behaviors. It also involves the improvement of supply of sanitation&#13;
goods and services and optimizing the overall enabling environment. Both components&#13;
ensure people are able to choose what they want and are willing to pay for what is&#13;
financially sustainable and cost effective.&#13;
&#13;
Community Led Total Sanitation: Key characteristics are:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Emphasis is on creating demand vs. supply driven&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Collective action/change/communal benefits&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Aim is Open Defecation Free communities&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Triggers first step on sanitation ladder&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Method of facilitation uses participatory methodologies/PRA&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Community led needs to be emphasized&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Requires outside facilitation&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Social pressure&#13;
&#13;
Step 2: Review of Behavior Change Models and Frameworks&#13;
&#13;
Participants reviewed behavior change models, frameworks, and concepts with the aim to&#13;
have all participants sharing a common vocabulary. The objectives for the session&#13;
included:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Define frameworks and models&#13;
   2. Discuss the importance of models and frameworks&#13;
                                            4&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;       3. Provide an overview of approaches to models and frameworks for behavior&#13;
          change&#13;
       4. Make recommendations for a framework for sanitation behavior change&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of using models and frameworks is to help guide research and practitioners&#13;
to plan behavior change interventions in a structured manner. Behavior change models&#13;
make assumptions about variables and the relationship between them and attempt to test a&#13;
causal link between behavioral determinants and the behavior. Frameworks are more of&#13;
an umbrella structure. They capture known variables about a behavior and are used to&#13;
outline possible courses of action, but they do not make assumptions or attempt to be&#13;
precise about causal relationships or the direction of causation.&#13;
&#13;
Models and frameworks are useful tools to inform evidence-based programming because&#13;
they help strategically focus resources, identify target behaviors and populations, provide&#13;
a common language, inform monitoring and evaluation systems, and help identify&#13;
research questions and information needs.&#13;
&#13;
There are more than 130 different models and frameworks of behavior change, and&#13;
typically they build on one another. Models and frameworks may be based on one&#13;
behavior change theory, but are generally informed by a mix of theories such as the&#13;
Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, Stages of Change, Diffusion of&#13;
Innovation. Participants were shown examples on the application of models and&#13;
frameworks to help them understand how the theoretical concepts are applied in practice.&#13;
This session also reviewed determinants of behavior that are common across many&#13;
different behavior change models and frameworks. (Table 1)&#13;

&amp;#12;handwashing behaviors, the facilitators recommended that the OAM framework be used&#13;
for sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
OAM is widely used in the fields of marketing and social marketing to explain behaviors&#13;
among target populations. The framework is based on three basic psychological concepts&#13;
that facilitate behavior change:&#13;
&#13;
Motivation: The impetus or drive toward carrying out a behavior;&#13;
&#13;
Ability: Skills and capabilities needed to perform a behavior;&#13;
&#13;
Opportunity: Contextual and situational constraints relevant to the performance of the&#13;
behavior.&#13;
&#13;
Step 3: Program and Research Presentations&#13;
The purpose of this session was to share knowledge and information and to orient&#13;
participants to behavioral determinants. As part of the workshop planning, participants&#13;
were asked to prepare a presentation covering the behavior they are trying to change in&#13;
their sanitation projects; a description of their target group(s); the methodological&#13;
approach they are taking e.g. CLTS, Social marketing, TSSM, PHAST; and, based on&#13;
their research, a list of the three most important behavioral determinants that affect&#13;
sanitation behavior. Presentations were made by: Martin Gauss, Beth Scott/Mimi Jenkins,&#13;
Jason Cardosi, Sara Fry, Ajith Kumar, Therese Dooley, and Jan Willem Rosenboom&#13;
(Annex 5).&#13;
&#13;
Step 4: Define Behavioral Determinants&#13;
The purpose of this session was to define sanitation behavioral determinants by marrying&#13;
the concepts presented in the morning with facts and observations of sanitation behavior&#13;
from existing literature. Participants worked in teams and were given cards containing&#13;
facts/observations about sanitation: Having your own latrine reduces discomfort and&#13;
embarrassment; Installation requires many decisions: toilet type, location, design, time of&#13;
installation. Participants were asked to categorize the facts/observations into common&#13;
themes and give the theme a label. Participants were also encouraged to add facts based&#13;
on their experience in the sector. These groupings were the basis for defining the&#13;
sanitation behavioral determinants: Benefits, Beliefs, Threats.&#13;
&#13;
The teams spent an hour categorizing facts and coming up with determinants which were&#13;
presented to the group. Based on the findings and categorization by each team, the group&#13;
refined the determinants that were generated and arrived at a common set, which is the&#13;
foundation for the sanitation OAM framework. The themes identified were:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Availability&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Affordability&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Beliefs/Attitudes&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Perception of Control,&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Self-Confidence&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Roles/Decisions&#13;
&#13;
                                             6&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;    â&#128;¢   Emotional Drivers (Sub-categories: Disgust, Comfort, Self Esteem, Pride, Being&#13;
        Modern)&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Social Support &amp; Influence&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Social Norms&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Skills&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Threats (e.g. Safety, Health, Snakes, Spirits)&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Access/Availability&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Product Attributes&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Enforcement&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Knowledge&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Competing Priorities&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Practical Benefits/Advantages&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Intention (whether you intend to carry out)&#13;
&#13;
Participants asked thought provoking questions as the group tried to refine the framework.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       There was discussion as to whether this framework could be applied to schools&#13;
        because sanitation access and use may be very different than at the household&#13;
        level. There was some concern that schools were just being thrown into the mix,&#13;
        but the consensus was to agree on the framework and apply it to a school setting&#13;
        to see how it would work.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       One issue raised was that building a latrine is not just a technical issue, but that it&#13;
        is a complex decision making process, and the participant recommended that&#13;
        â&#128;&#156;complexityâ&#128;? could be a strong determinant; however the general agreement&#13;
        among the group was that â&#128;&#156;complexityâ&#128;? is intertwined in all of the determinants&#13;
        and therefore it should not be isolated on its own.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       A question was raised as to whether this framework could work for target&#13;
        populations on the supply side of sanitation (masons or pit emptying service&#13;
        providers). The consensus was that the framework could help identify the&#13;
        determinants that suppliers of sanitation goods and services need to address, but&#13;
        this would need to be tested.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       A question was raised if â&#128;&#156;tenancyâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;landâ&#128;? were stand alone determinants or if&#13;
        they should fall under access/availability or threat? The group consensus was that&#13;
        â&#128;&#156;tenancyâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;landâ&#128;? will be under access/availability and enforcement.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       Someone asked whether a change agent (i.e. external force) or stakeholders was a&#13;
        determinant. The group agreed that the determinant â&#128;&#156;Social Support/Influenceâ&#128;?&#13;
        would cover these external forces.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       The question of where â&#128;&#156;timeâ&#128;? fits in the framework was raised, and the group&#13;
        agreed that â&#128;&#156;timeâ&#128;? would be included under the determinant â&#128;&#147; Affordability.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       Someone proposed â&#128;&#156;habitâ&#128;? as a determinant, but the group did not come to&#13;
        agreement on it, so it was not included in the framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               7&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢       â&#128;&#156;Previous experienceâ&#128;? with a latrine was proposed and the group decided that this&#13;
        concept would go under â&#128;&#156;attitudeâ&#128;?. â&#128;&#156;Value of a latrineâ&#128;? to the household, would&#13;
        fall under the determinant â&#128;&#156;Practical Benefitsâ&#128;?, but personal â&#128;&#156;Valuesâ&#128;? would be a&#13;
        stand alone determinant.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       Some terms such as â&#128;&#156;Self-efficacyâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;Locus of Controlâ&#128;? were not commonly&#13;
        understood among all participants, so the group re-titled them â&#128;&#156;Self Confidenceâ&#128;?&#13;
        and â&#128;&#156;Perception of Controlâ&#128;? respectively.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       Based on the groupâ&#128;&#153;s experience, they felt strongly about isolating emotions such&#13;
        as â&#128;&#156;Self-Esteem/Prideâ&#128;? as its own determinant. The end result was a determinant&#13;
        called Emotional Drivers which captures a range of emotions including: disgust,&#13;
        purity, comfort, respect, embarrassment, being modern, being part of society, and&#13;
        a first class citizen.&#13;
&#13;
Step 5: Categorize Determinants Within OAM&#13;
This session focused on categorizing the determinants identified in the previous step and&#13;
placing them into the OAM framework. This session was the last session of the day and&#13;
the group agreed that it would be better for the facilitators to categorize the determinants&#13;
and review them with the group the following day. The end result of the first day was a&#13;
sanitation framework as shown in Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Table 2&#13;
Focus     Opportunity               Ability                          Motivation&#13;
          Product Attributes        Social Support &amp; Influence       Intention (to carry out behavior)&#13;
          Access &amp; Availability     Affordability                    Emotional Drivers&#13;
          Enforcement               Roles &amp; Decisions                Beliefs/Attitudes&#13;
          Social Norms              Skills                           Threats&#13;
                                    Knowledge                        Perception of Control&#13;
                                    Self Confidence (I can do it)    Values&#13;
                                                                     Competing Priorities&#13;
                                                                     Practical Benefits/advantages&#13;
                                                                     Self Esteem/Pride&#13;
&#13;
Step 6: Review of Opportunity, Ability, and Motivation (OAM)&#13;
Framework&#13;
This session reviewed the concepts of the OAM framework. The facilitators reviewed&#13;
examples of what OAM means in everyday life to help participants relate the concept to&#13;
reality. The main points that this session conveyed were that in order to do any behavior&#13;
you have to:&#13;
&#13;
    Â&#153; Want to do it = Motivation&#13;
    Â&#153; Be able to do it = Ability&#13;
    Â&#153; Have the opportunity to do it = Opportunity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              8&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;After the OAM review, the group validated how the facilitators categorized the&#13;
determinants in OAM. The group agreed with the sanitation framework and requested&#13;
that examples of each determinant be provided for future use. (Annex 2)&#13;
&#13;
Step 7: Prioritize Determinants&#13;
&#13;
The teams were assigned a target group and behavior change objective, which constitutes&#13;
the Focus part of the FOAM framework. Using the newly developed sanitation FOAM&#13;
framework (SaniFOAM), the teams were asked to prioritize the determinants that they&#13;
thought would be most important to their target group and behavior change objective.&#13;
The three scenarios were:&#13;
&#13;
                                    Table 3&#13;
             Target Group                Desired Behavior&#13;
             Urban Households            Upgrade facility&#13;
             Rural households            Stop open defecation&#13;
             School children             Use school latrines&#13;
&#13;
The teams prioritized each of the SaniFOAM determinants by â&#128;&#156;low priority for this target&#13;
groupâ&#128;?, â&#128;&#156;evidence gap to know whether it is high priorityâ&#128;?, and â&#128;&#156;high priorityâ&#128;?.&#13;
This session produced rich discussions about determinants in each of three scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
Target Group # 1 (Urban Households)&#13;
The urban household group focused on tenant population i.e. non-owners and found that&#13;
all of the determinants were important.&#13;
                                         Table 4&#13;

                                                                  Benefits/Advantages&#13;
                                                                  Threats&#13;
                                                                  Perception of&#13;
                                                                  Control&#13;

                                               Social Support &amp;        out behavior)&#13;
                                               Influence&#13;
&#13;
Low priority for      N/A                      N/A                     N/A&#13;
this target group&#13;
&#13;
This group reported that perception of control was a big issue for them because of the&#13;
landlord/tenant relationship. The fact that tenants do not have control of their situation is&#13;
                                              9&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;a significant issue for tenants. Tenants feel that landlords are responsible for latrines. If&#13;
tenants decide to build a latrine, they will wait until they have their own land. Another&#13;
comment was that landlords are scared to build latrines because if they have to raise the&#13;
rent to pay for the latrine, the tenants will leave.&#13;
&#13;
One participant noted that this points out the need to address the enabling environment&#13;
and look at policy issues. The group discussed how this framework can help identify the&#13;
problems at the household level to determine what policies need to change at the macro&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
Target Group #2 (Rural Households)&#13;
One point that came out of this discussion was that each of the determinants in the&#13;
framework has both positive and negative sides. For example, â&#128;&#156;social normâ&#128;? could be&#13;
open defecation free, or the norm could be to defecate in the open. Another example is&#13;
practical benefits - if a latrine keeps someone out of the rain, away from snakes and has a&#13;
lockable door for privacy, then it is a benefit. However the converse if also true, if you&#13;
have a facility which has a cloth superstructure with no roof then none of the practical&#13;
benefits mentioned above would be met and would continue to be barriers.&#13;

this target group&#13;
&#13;
Target Group #3 (School Children)&#13;
A participant pointed out that these determinants may change depending if the target&#13;
audience is children or school teachers. This is why it is important to keep the framework&#13;
broad enough to capture various segments of the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Because this framework is a first draft, it will change as evidence is generated from the&#13;
sector. The framework is a living document and will change as new evidence refines our&#13;
understanding of the different determinants. Over time new determinants might be added&#13;
and others might be removed. Participants were reminded that this exercise demonstrates&#13;
that not all determinants are applicable to all segments or target groups.&#13;
&#13;
Step 8: The Marketing Mix&#13;
This session discussed the concepts of the marketing mix (4 pâ&#128;&#153;s) through examples of&#13;
communication and promotional campaigns and strategies (public and private). The&#13;
analogy used to describe the relationship between the marketing mix and the OAM&#13;
framework is that the OAM framework provides the ingredients and the marketing mix&#13;
provides the recipe for implementation&#13;
&#13;
The marketing mix (4Pâ&#128;&#153;s) is defined as:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Product â&#128;&#147; good, service, idea, behavior. It is not just a tangible product but can&#13;
        be emotional. In sanitation behavior change, products might include latrines,&#13;
        emptying services, financial services or the idea of sanitation as a household&#13;
        necessity&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Price â&#128;&#147; any cost associated with product ( non-monetary: time,) and (monetary: $)&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Place â&#128;&#147; where and when the target audience will perform the desired behavior&#13;
        and/or acquire campaign tangible objects, or receive services associated with the&#13;
        campaign [distribution] 7&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Promotion â&#128;&#147;1. what you want to communicate (key messages), 2. who will be the&#13;
        messenger i.e. who will deliver the message (spokesman, sponsors, partners ), 3.&#13;
        where will messages appear i.e. what are the communication channels&#13;
        (Advertising via TV, radio, print; promotional events such as street drama;&#13;
        promotional items such as t-shirts, hats, pins) 8&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;Each team took two of their high priority determinants from the previous session and&#13;
mapped out an intervention using the 4 Ps. This exercise proved to be challenging for the&#13;
teams, however, they did a remarkable job given the short exposure to the topic.&#13;
&#13;
The point of the exercise was to practice applying the framework using the marketing&#13;
mix. Participants were reminded that they donâ&#128;&#153;t need to come up with the 4 Pâ&#128;&#153;s for every&#13;
determinant.&#13;
&#13;
Step 9: Review Objectives/Expectations and Conduct Evaluation&#13;
The facilitators reviewed objectives of the workshop and participantâ&#128;&#153;s expectations. The&#13;
group agreed that the objectives of the workshop and most of their expectations were met.&#13;
There were a few expectations that were not addressed and are listed below. Overall, the&#13;
response to the workshop was positive. Given the vast expertise and experience of the&#13;
participants plus the introduction of new concepts and ideas for many participants, and&#13;
the short time period, the group covered an enormous amount of ground in two days.&#13;

Expectations and unanswered questions&#13;
  â&#128;¢    The application of SaniFOAM to monitoring and evaluation was not addressed.&#13;
 â&#128;¢     Is moving to the second step of the sanitation ladder, a collective or individual&#13;
       action?&#13;
  â&#128;¢    What are the affects of animal excreta on human health?&#13;
  â&#128;¢    Do we need to re-name the determinants of Benefits and Enforcement?&#13;
&#13;
Step 10: Next Steps&#13;
WSP will use the participantsâ&#128;&#153; inputs and workshop proceedings to further refine the&#13;
framework and produce an operational guide on its use. This will include specific&#13;
guidance on engaging expertise to carry out formative research and various aspects of&#13;
program implementation.&#13;
&#13;
A workshop format will be developed for country sanitation stakeholders to apply&#13;
SaniFOAM. With these tools, WSP hopes to help practitioners design, implement, and&#13;
monitor behavior change activities within sanitation interventions.&#13;

            Developing a sanitation behavior change
            framework : SaniFOAM
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)
            hosted a consultative workshop in Durban, South Africa from
            February 21-22, 2008 to develop a sanitation behavior change
            framework. The workshop was attended by 27 participants from
            organizations working to improve sanitation globally.  The
            framework is intended to help practitioners:  Understand
            consumer needs and wants; change behavior in a given
            setting; inform research; improve monitoring and evaluation
            designs; and engage and supervise consultants when
            implementing sanitation behavior change programs. This
            framework can also be incorporated into other models and
            frameworks being used in sanitation such as Participatory
            Hygiene and Sanitation (PHAST).  The workshop had three
            broad objectives: 1) Review determinants of sanitation
            behavior; 2) Develop a framework for sanitation behavior
            change; 3) Determine how to operationalize the framework.
            The active involvement of participants was a key factor in
            achieving the stated workshop objectives. The participants
            developed a common language of behavior change terminology
            and worked together to develop a sanitation behavior change
            framework called SaniFOAM.
