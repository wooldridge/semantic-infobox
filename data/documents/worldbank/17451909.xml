&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
This study evaluates European Union (EU) experience of the mobility of skilled labor&#13;
migrants after the 2004 and 2007 EU enlargements and from the European Neighborhood&#13;
Policy (ENP) countries. The study concludes that migration generally improves the allocative&#13;
efficiency of labor markets and there is little if any evidence of statistically significant or&#13;
economically relevant negative aggregate effects of migration on receiving labor markets.&#13;
While outflow of young and skilled workers may pose risks to sending countriesâ&#128;&#153; economic&#13;
prospects and public finance, circular migration, brain gain, and remittances attenuate such&#13;
risks, and have the potential to become powerful engines of convergence. Obstructive&#13;
legislation and ill-designed migration policies impede migration and deprive sending and&#13;
receiving countries of such potential benefits.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This summary presents the results of a study conducted by Martin Kahanec for the World&#13;
Bank. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the European Union (EU) experience&#13;
of the mobility of skilled labor migrants and to draw lessons from this experience for the&#13;
integration of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members. The EU experience&#13;
of free mobility is evaluated in two specific contexts: intra-EU migration after the 2004 and&#13;
2007 EU enlargements and migration to the European Union from the European&#13;
Neighborhood Policy (ENP) countries. The study confines its attention to labor market&#13;
aspects of skilled labor mobility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation of the EU experience of skilled labor mobility&#13;
The EU single labor market is one of the most successful policy areas of EU integration and&#13;
enlargement. Free labor mobility within the European Union provides for an increased&#13;
allocative efficiency of human capital and labor across EU labor markets. The expansion of&#13;
the free movement of workers to 12 new EU member states in the 2000s has indeed&#13;
resulted in significant additional migration flows in the European Union. Although this has&#13;
increased overall labor mobility in the European Union, it still remains below what is&#13;
observed in the United States or even the Russian Federation. In spite of transitional&#13;
arrangements, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements have significantly increased geographic&#13;
mobility in the European Union. Given the slowdown of post-enlargement migration in the&#13;
late 2000s and early 2010s, the increase was probably only temporary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In spite of low intra-EU mobility rates, some EU member states are host to significant&#13;
immigrant populations. Contrary to the overall perception immigrants in the European&#13;
Union attain levels of formal education broadly comparable to natives; although there is&#13;
significant variation across countries and immigrant groups with e.g. immigrants from ENP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              5&#13;
&amp;#12;countries in the EU15 1 generally attaining lower educational levels than the natives.&#13;
However, with the exception of EU15 and EFTA migrants (migrants from countries party to&#13;
the European Free Trade Agreement), their occupational status tends to be lower than that&#13;
of natives, signifying a degree of downskilling. Downskilling may be a result of&#13;
discrimination, language and institutional barriers, but it may also be a part of migration&#13;
trajectory preferred by some migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
European migration is mainly driven by job- and family-related factors. Housing and local&#13;
environment concerns are also significant for future moves. Among the main barriers to&#13;
European mobility are transitional arrangements (which as of June 2012 still apply to&#13;
Bulgarian and Romanian workers), linguistic and cultural barriers, as well as anxiety about&#13;
finding a suitable job in the host country. EU10 2 migrants in the EU15 are on average&#13;
positively selected vis-Ã -vis the source as well as the host populations. In contrast, EU2 3&#13;
migrants in the EU15 are less educated than the host as well as the source populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The European Union has progressed in harmonizing legislation in order to facilitate internal&#13;
mobility. While there is some evidence that immigrants â&#128;&#156;grease the wheels of the labor&#13;
marketâ&#128;? 4 more than natives by allocating to sectors with labor shortages, there still remain&#13;
significant barriers to labor mobility in the European Union that may jeopardize such a&#13;
positive effect of migration. These include: transitional arrangements restricting migrants&#13;
from the EU2; administratively complex transfer and exercise of social-security and health-&#13;
insurance rights; complex cross-border taxation issues; practical difficulties with the&#13;
recognition of foreign qualifications; and discrimination of migrants in access to business&#13;

&amp;#12;services. Minimum wages and hiring and firing regulations interact with high-skilled&#13;
migration in a non-trivial manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The ENP aims to promote mobility between the European Union and its â&#128;&#156;neighborhoodâ&#128;?&#13;
through improved labor markets access, investment possibilities, and intensified&#13;
professional, educational and cultural exchange. The degree to which this goal has been&#13;
achieved varies country by country. Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) have achieved&#13;
easier recognition of qualifications but difficulties with implementation persist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Among the ENP countries, Algeria, Morocco and Ukraine top the list of source countries&#13;
with the highest numbers of migrants in the European Union. As a share in the host&#13;
population, Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Germany and Italy, as well as the Baltic states&#13;
and Slovenia, are host to the largest ENP populations. In spite of the high share of highly&#13;
educated workers among emigrants from some ENP countries, the overall share of high&#13;
skilled among ENP migrants in the EU15 tends to be relatively low. This is because the&#13;
European Union is losing skilled migrants to the United States and other destinations.&#13;
Irregular migration may negatively affect skilled immigration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Skilled labor migration from ENP countries to the European Union is driven by a number of&#13;
factors. These mainly include lagging economic development in the sending countries (low&#13;
wages, high unemployment and rising prices), a gap in opportunities for personal and&#13;
professional development after graduation between ENP countries and the European Union,&#13;
and a gap in access to quality social and health-care services and to adequate social security&#13;
programs between ENP countries and the European Union. High fertility rates (primarily in&#13;
some of the countries south of the Mediterranean) cause migrants to seek employment&#13;
abroad in order to support large families. Educational opportunities and the acquisition of&#13;
language skills in the host countries are important pull factors for some migrants. On the&#13;
other hand, corruption, territorial conflicts, poor governance and state protection policy in&#13;
the sending countries are significant push factors. Bilateral agreements and facilitative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               7&#13;
&amp;#12;programs of individual member states create opportunities for skilled mobility from ENP&#13;
countries. However, the shortage of skilled labor in the European Union has yet to be filled.&#13;
The main barriers to mobility from ENP countries to the European Union include restrictive&#13;
visa regimes and costly immigration procedures, non-recognition of academic diplomas and&#13;
professional certificates, strict limitations on the possibility to stay in the host country for&#13;
migrants who lose their job and a lack of information about labor market opportunities.&#13;
Restrictive immigration management, including binding quotas, language barriers and&#13;
negative attitudes toward immigrants further hinder migration flows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The potential benefits of immigration include: effects on the distribution of earnings,&#13;
improved allocative efficiency in the labor market, a better flow of ideas, knowledge and&#13;
technology, goods and services, as well as capital, increased diversity of the labor force and&#13;
positive effects on public finance. The scale and nature of these effects are determined by&#13;
the scale and skill composition of migration flows, their temporal character, the speed of&#13;
immigrantsâ&#128;&#153; adjustment in host labor markets and labor market institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although there is generally no evidence of significant and economically relevant negative&#13;
effects of post-enlargement migration on receiving labor markets or welfare systems, there&#13;
are some indications that post-enlargement out-migration has contributed to higher wages&#13;
in the sending countries. However, the outflow of young and skilled workers poses risks to&#13;
sending countriesâ&#128;&#153; welfare systems. These risks seem to persist in spite of the potential of&#13;
remittances and brain gain to compensate for the loss of labor. Simulations indicate a&#13;
positive effect of post-enlargement migration of around â&#130;¬ 30,000 per migrant, based on&#13;
aggregate per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of the European Union. In general, the&#13;
redistributive effects on wages and unemployment appear to be rather small and probably&#13;
not very persistent. Hence, although local and temporary redistributive effects cannot be&#13;
ruled out, empirical evidence on the effects of migration on sending and receiving countries&#13;
suggests that labor markets absorb immigrants rather seamlessly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 8&#13;
&amp;#12;Lessons learned from the EU experience&#13;
The EU experience of skilled labor mobility offers a number of lessons. In view of the&#13;
demographic challenges Europe faces, well-qualified migrants are very much needed.&#13;
Empirical evidence shows that the hypothesis of negative wage or employment effects of&#13;
migration in receiving countries is a myth; and so seems to be the hypothesis that migrants&#13;
â&#128;&#156;shopâ&#128;? for welfare. And yet, European migration discourse is generally ill-informed and&#13;
results in a â&#128;&#156;Fortress-Europeâ&#128;? approach to migration. Although some liberalization of&#13;
immigration occurred in the early 2000s, the crisis of the late 2000s and early 2010s has&#13;
reversed many of these efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Paradoxically, discontent with the socio-economic integration of immigrants, Europeans are&#13;
in a vicious circle and seem to discourage migrants with a higher probability of integrating â&#128;&#147;&#13;
and attract those with lower one. Misinterpreting the lack of immigrant integration as&#13;
something inevitable for immigrants and ignoring the available evidence about the effects&#13;
of immigration, they form rather negative beliefs and attitudes regarding immigration. This&#13;
leads to a political backlash against further immigration and an implementation of&#13;
restrictive immigration policy measures. But it is precisely high-skilled immigrants that are&#13;
more sensitive to such negative attitudes and policy, and may choose other destinations. It&#13;
is not surprising then, that Europe attracts fewer high-skilled immigrants than its main&#13;
competitors, such as the United States. Such negative selection results in substandard labor&#13;
market outcomes of immigrants, which further fuels nativesâ&#128;&#153; negative attitudes and&#13;
completes the vicious circle. It should also not be forgotten that negative attitudes is the&#13;
quintessential barrier to immigrant integration, aggravating the situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This broad discrepancy between beliefs and evidence tells us that skillful management of&#13;
beliefs and attitudes regarding immigration is absolutely vital for any migration policy to&#13;
succeed. Given the sensitivity of the issue, the line between a vicious and virtuous circle&#13;
may be thin. Therefore, a careful and transparent framing of migration policy is important.&#13;
This includes a policy-making process based on rigorous analysis and careful interpretation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               9&#13;
&amp;#12;of available evidence. It also involves transparency of the process with respect to the&#13;
stakeholders and society as a whole. Discrimination and xenophobia need to be specifically&#13;
addressed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From a practical perspective, harmonization of legislation, policies and institutions reduces&#13;
the costs of migration. Although the European Union has done much in this regard,&#13;
especially concerning free mobility in its internal market, many obstacles to mobility still&#13;
remain. These are often nitty-gritty â&#128;&#147; yet decisive â&#128;&#147; details, such as recognition of past&#13;
employment in another member state for unemployment benefit eligibility. Addressing&#13;
such obstacles requires a thorough review based on dialogue with stakeholders. Hidden&#13;
double taxation of spouses working in different member states and complex tax exemptions&#13;
should also be avoided, as these are extremely difficult for migrants to manage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Downskilling of immigrants into jobs at lower skill-levels is a specific issue that requires&#13;
attention. Therefore, recognition of qualifications is of key importance for full utilization of&#13;
migrantsâ&#128;&#153; human capital. General harmonization efforts and MRAs help in this regard. For&#13;
migrants with often non-trivial migration trajectories, however, they often render the&#13;
administrative and legislative landscape overly complex. A difficulty is that even in the case&#13;
of sufficient formal harmonization, its implementation suffers from inadequate&#13;
administrative resources. Any efforts to harmonize legislation, policies and institutions need&#13;
to take good consideration of the possibility of non-trivial migration trajectories of migrants&#13;
and their family members. Adequate administrative capacity to provide them with&#13;
proficient service of state institutions needs to be ensured as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As internationalization of higher education is an important channel of skilled migration,&#13;
harmonization of education is required. The Bologna Process has helped on the formal side,&#13;
but gaps remain in its implementation. A specific problem is that employers are not always&#13;
ready to quickly accept the new classification of degrees implemented within the Bologna&#13;
Process and confusion abounds. An important policy area is communication and providing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               10&#13;
&amp;#12;information to potential employers of migrants. For international students, the transition&#13;
from education to employment needs to be facilitated by granting them a sufficiently long&#13;
period after graduation to stay in the country and search for a job, with also access to&#13;
welfare and health services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The family perspective is clearly very important for international migration. This especially&#13;
concerns an adequate access of family members to social and health policies. In addition,&#13;
access to the labor market should also be provided to tied family migrants. This is especially&#13;
important for skilled migrants, as they may be more sensitive to limited work options for&#13;
their spouses. To facilitate integration of permanent migrants, a transparent and&#13;
predictable path towards citizenship should be provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Europe does recognize some of the challenges it faces in the domain of mobility&#13;
management, and has come up with a number of new approaches. One of which is the&#13;
European Blue Card, enabling the entry of skilled third-country nationals on relatively&#13;
favorable terms. It has also implemented the European Health Insurance Card, facilitating&#13;
health-care access to EU nationals in the whole of the European Union, and is considering&#13;
the EU Professional Card, which would facilitate the recognition of professional&#13;
qualifications in all EU member states. Professional associations are also actively trying to&#13;
overcome the problems with the recognition of qualifications: for example, the European&#13;
Federation of National Engineering Associations uses the European EngineerING Card,&#13;
increasing the transparency and transferability of skills for engineers. While these efforts&#13;
are commendable, the key lesson from the EU experience of free mobility of workers is that&#13;
the creation of a single market must go hand in hand with the provision of labor market&#13;
institutions covering the whole single market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Europe is trying to achieve this by harmonizing national regulations and institutions.&#13;
However, a more fruitful approach would be creation of new institutions, including health&#13;
insurance, pension and social security schemes, operating at the EU level and unconstrained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;by national borders. This is not a proposal for the creation of an unlikely â&#128;&#156;welfare unionâ&#128;?,&#13;
but rather a proposal for the liberalization of social, pension and health insurance for at&#13;
least some types of workers and migrants in particular.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From the discussion above, it has also become clear that transparency and the provision of&#13;
information are central to the success of migration policy. Migration inevitably involves&#13;
informational gaps on the side of migrants who enter new host countries. In fact, returning&#13;
migrants may also have difficulties re-adjusting to institutions in their country of origin.&#13;
Given the fractionalization of EU institutional space by national borders, with each member&#13;
state having its own (even if partly harmonized) regulation, it is desirable to provide&#13;
migrants with one-stop information and service shops facilitating their integration into their&#13;
new host country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Finally, increasing the transparency of migration and more evidence-based migration policy&#13;
making also involves evaluating implemented policies. This comprises data collection,&#13;
rigorous independent policy evaluation, including dissemination of relevant statistical&#13;
results to not only experts but also stakeholders and the general public, evidence-based&#13;
policy design and implementation, as well as independent monitoring the whole process.&#13;

&amp;#12;I. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There appears to be reasonable consensus â&#128;&#147; at least among labor market experts â&#128;&#147; that&#13;
skilled immigration is desirable because of its economic benefits in the receiving countries. 5&#13;
As for the sending countries, the outflow of skilled labor, or brain drain, may hurt them in&#13;
terms of gross domestic product (GDP) or ability to finance public goods and services. Brain&#13;
gain and brain circulation may, however, mitigate or even overturn the possible negative&#13;
effects of out-migration.6 A better allocation of human resources and the broader effects of&#13;
migration on productivity, investment, trade and knowledge transfer all improve the overall&#13;
efficiency of sending and receiving labor markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When eight Central Eastern European countries (EU8) 7 along with Cyprus and Malta joined&#13;
the European Union in 2004, the size of the EU internal market increased by 74.1 million&#13;
citizens. An additional 29.5 million citizens joined the European Union with the 2007&#13;
enlargement, which included Bulgaria and Romania (EU2). 8 In effect, the eastern&#13;
enlargement of the European Union, with its 2004 and 2007 waves, increased the size of&#13;
the EU population by more than a quarter, 26.9 percent.&#13;
&#13;

6&#13;
    Brain drain refers to the loss of skilled individuals due to out-migration. Brain gain in sending countries is&#13;
understood to represent the increase in human capital as a consequence of either return migration of workers&#13;
who gained additional human capital abroad or increased human capital of non-migrants who increase their&#13;
investment in their own human capital as a consequence of out-migration of others. The latter effect may&#13;
occur as a consequence of increased return to investment in human capital due to, for example, the scarcity of&#13;
skilled labor domestically, the value of the option to utilize oneâ&#128;&#153;s own skills abroad more efficiently, or&#13;
remittances paying for better education to the children who remain behind. The return, or a sequence of&#13;
migrations and returns, of skilled workers is called brain circulation. See Kahanec (2013) for a discussion about&#13;
redistributive effects of migration.&#13;

&amp;#12;As EU law guarantees the citizens of any EU member state the freedom of movement within&#13;
the whole European Union,9 the EU eastern enlargement was also a major experiment of&#13;
removing barriers to migration between countries that, at the time of enlargement, differed&#13;
economically, socially and politically. A critical evaluation of lessons learned from the recent&#13;
EU enlargement can inform policy debates about liberalization of migration policies in other&#13;
contexts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The case is even more informative for the variation of liberalization policies it entailed.&#13;
Given the large population, relatively high unemployment rates, lower GDP and standards&#13;
of living, as well as little prior experience of migration during the Cold War, the expansion of&#13;
the right of free movement to new member states from Central Eastern Europe sparked&#13;
deep controversies â&#128;&#147; especially in the 15 pre-enlargement EU member states (EU15). 10&#13;
These controversies resulted in transitional arrangements effectively delaying full&#13;
liberalization of the access of citizens from the new member states to EU15 labor markets&#13;
for up to seven years, with evaluation after two and five years.11 In the acceding countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

    The freedom of movement of workers is stipulated in Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the&#13;
European Union. The Treaty on the European Union, Directive 2004/38/EC and the Case Law of the European&#13;
Court of Justice extend this freedom to all EU nationals, as well as to their close family members, provided that&#13;
they possess comprehensive health insurance and do not pose an undue burden for the public funds in the&#13;
host country.&#13;

     Cyprus and Malta were exempt from transitional arrangements. Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom&#13;
opened up their labor markets in May 2004, while Austria and Germany enforced restricted access, albeit&#13;
somewhat simplified, until 2011. The other EU15 states had gradually liberalized access by May 1, 2009. As for&#13;
the EU2, ten member states had opened up by January 1, 2009: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland,&#13;
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden. By January 1, 2012, Denmark, Greece, Hungary,&#13;
Portugal, and Spain liberalized as well, with Austria, Germany, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta,&#13;
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom still applying transitional arrangements as of February 2012. In July&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        14&#13;
&amp;#12;some fears of brain drain surfaced, but the discussion about EU accession was framed&#13;
rather positively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
With more than two million EU Schengen visas issued to citizens of European Neighborhood&#13;
Policy (ENP) countries12 in 2008 alone, mobility between the EU and ENP countries offers&#13;
another interesting context to study high-skilled migration. In fact, a scrutiny of migration&#13;
between the EU and ENP countries may shed additional light on the effects of a range of&#13;
specific migration policies that have been implemented in this context, including various&#13;
types of visa regulation, MRAs or skill-related mobility policies. Figure 1.1 depicts the&#13;
political map of Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Labor mobility is particularly important in the context of EU economic and monetary&#13;
integration. In fact, the viability of the European Monetary Union (EMU) vitally depends on&#13;
the capacity of EMU economies to absorb economic shocks that affect member states&#13;
differently. In a monetary union with wage rigidities and without fiscal union, as is the case&#13;
in the EMU, mobility of workers may be an important mechanism of adjustment to such&#13;
asymmetric shocks. The low mobility rates in the European Union, as compared to other&#13;
single currency areas, such as Australia, Canada, the Russian Federation or the United States,&#13;
thus signify a major deficiency in EU capacity to adjust to economic shocks and may&#13;
potentially even derail the EU integration project.13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;The first section of this paper evaluates the experience of the European Union with internal&#13;
mobility of workers and its labor market effects in sending and receiving EU member states,&#13;
with a specific focus on skilled migration. We review the institutional framework as well as&#13;
key indicators of the free movement of workers in the European Union; we study the&#13;
determinants of and remaining obstacles to internal labor mobility in the European Union;&#13;
and we evaluate the potentials and challenges of the harmonization of legislation at the&#13;
sub-EU level to facilitate skilled mobility in the European Union. Finally, we examine the role&#13;
of EU labor market institutions in conditioning the flows of skilled migrants in the European&#13;
Union.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The next section examines the role of a range of migration policies for skilled labor flows&#13;
between ENP countries and the European Union, as well as the effects of such flows in&#13;
those countries. Similarly as for internal mobility in the European Union, we first examine&#13;
the institutional and political contexts of the ENP. We then review the patterns of skilled&#13;
labor mobility between the European Union and the EU Neighborhood partner countries;&#13;
study the determinants of skilled labor mobility between the EU and the ENP; evaluate the&#13;
impact of the ENP on skilled migration into and within the European Union; and shed light&#13;
on the remaining obstacles to internal mobility of the skilled EU labor force.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Section IV evaluates some of the key questions that drive migration policy debates around&#13;
the globe, such as whether migrants displace resident workers from their jobs or whether&#13;
they decrease their wages. Another perspective that we consider is that of the sending&#13;
countries and the labor market effects of out-migration. We then draw lessons from the EU&#13;
experience for Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members in Section V and&#13;
conclude.&#13;

&amp;#12;II. The experience of the European Union with internal mobility of skilled labor&#13;
II.a The free movement of people in the context of EU integration and enlargement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The expansion of the free movement of workers to 12 new member states in the&#13;
 2000s has triggered significant migration flows, but geographic mobility remained&#13;
 low in the European Union.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Some EU member states are host to significant immigrant populations. With the&#13;
 exception of ENP migrants in the EU15, immigrants in the European Union generally&#13;
 attain formal educational levels comparable to natives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 With the exception of EU15 and EFTA migrants, their occupational status tends to be&#13;
 lower than that of natives, signifying a degree of downskilling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Downskilling may occur because of a discrepancy between formal education and&#13;
 skills, discrimination, language or institutional barriers, but it also may be a part of&#13;
 migration trajectory preferred by some migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The freedom of movement of workers is one of the four key pillars of the EU internal&#13;
market, along with free mobility of capital, goods and services. This fundamental freedom&#13;
enables EU nationals to move to another EU member state, seek and accept employment&#13;
there, reside there with their family members and gain access to social benefits on the same&#13;
terms as the nationals of the receiving country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In spite of these legal provisions, the persistent cultural, social, linguistic and other barriers&#13;
have kept internal mobility in the European Union rather low compared to the United&#13;
States (Bonin et al., 2008). According to that study, the share of annual cross-border movers&#13;
of the total EU population was just 0.1 percent in 2006. Looking at interregional moves&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                18&#13;
&amp;#12;across NUTS2 regions (Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics), the corresponding&#13;
figure was 1 percent, still significantly below the 2.5-percent interstate annual movers&#13;
observed in the United States. According to Gill and Raiser (2012), annual interstate&#13;
mobility of the working-age population in the EU15 prior to the 2004 enlargement was just&#13;
about 1 percent, compared to around 3 percent in the United States, 2 percent in Canada&#13;
and Australia, and 1.7 percent in the Russian Federation.14 There is, however, variation&#13;
across the European Union with respect to this measure, with southern EU member states&#13;
attaining annual interregional mobility of only about 0.5 percent, whereas France, Ireland,&#13;
the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom exhibit much higher mobility rates of&#13;
around 2 percent (Bonin et al., 2008). Although the recent EU enlargement increased the&#13;
intensity of intra-EU migration, due to the abovementioned barriers, internal migration in&#13;
the European Union can be expected to remain relatively modest in the foreseeable future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Despite the relatively low intra-EU mobility rates, EU member states are an important&#13;
destination for migrants from other EU member states as well as non-EU countries. In this&#13;
section we use the 2010 wave of the EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS) to document some&#13;
characteristics of immigrant groups in the EU. Following the categorization of countries of&#13;
origin available in the dataset, we examine stocks of immigrants from the EU15 and&#13;
countries party to the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA), EU12, European Union&#13;
neighborhood (EUN) as a proxy for ENP, and immigrants from other origins. 15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
     Interregional mobility measures are sensitive to the definition of regions (and migrants), so a ceteris-paribus&#13;
comparison of the European Union with other countries is hard to achieve.&#13;
15&#13;
     EUN denotes the European Union neighborhood broadly defined, including Albania, Andorra, Belarus,&#13;
Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, the Faroe Islands, Kosovo (UN Security Council resolution 1244), Monaco, the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia,&#13;
Turkey, Ukraine and the Vatican, and Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and recognized non-citizens. As&#13;
the categorization of countries in the EU Labour Force Survey does not permit singling out ENP migrants, we&#13;
use EUN as a proxy for ENP in this analysis. Other-origin immigrants include those not from the European&#13;
Union, EFTA or EUN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          19&#13;
&amp;#12;Figure 2.1 reveals significant and varied shares of foreigners in host populations across the&#13;
European Union. Cyprus, Austria, Ireland and Belgium attract the largest numbers of&#13;
immigrants from within the European Union or from its neighborhood. The largest shares of&#13;
EU15+EFTA immigrants are in Ireland, Belgium and Cyprus; of NMS immigrants in Ireland&#13;
and Cyprus, but also Italy, Austria and the United Kingdom; and of EUN immigrants in Latvia,&#13;
Estonia and Slovenia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As a general pattern, we observe significantly larger shares of foreign populations in the&#13;
EU15 than in the EU10 or EU2. However, there are notable exceptions: among the EU15,&#13;
Finland, with a rather small foreign population; and among the new member states, Cyprus&#13;
and Malta, with larger foreign populations. The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania)&#13;
also exhibit relatively large foreign populations, but these are mostly the people that (were)&#13;
relocated during the times of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. (USSR). 16 Similarly, the&#13;
high share of EUN immigrants in Slovenia dates back to migration within the former&#13;
Yugoslavia, from which Slovenia seceded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Figure 2.1, we can also observe an interesting pattern for the Baltic states. Each of them&#13;
inherited significant immigrant populations from the Soviet times. The relatively liberal&#13;
naturalization regime in Lithuania apparently resulted in a rather small immigrant&#13;
population when measured by nationality compared to that measured by country of birth.&#13;

United Kingdom. Immigrants are people who were not born in the country in which they live. Natives are&#13;
those born to mothers residing in the respective country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                  21&#13;
&amp;#12;In Estonia, many of the foreign-born naturalized, although the naturalization rate appears&#13;
to be much smaller than in Lithuania. Latvia is an exception, being the only country in the&#13;
European Union in which the foreign population by nationality exceeds that measured by&#13;
country of birth.17 This reflects the rather strict naturalization regime, which effectively&#13;
denies citizenship to a large proportion of Russian speakers and even their Latvian-born&#13;
descendants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The late 1990s and 2000s witnessed generally increasing foreign populations in the EU15.&#13;
However, these migrants came mainly from non-EU15 and non-EU27 countries, rather than&#13;
EU15 member states (Bonin et al., 2008). This observation casts some doubts on the extent&#13;
to which deepened EU integration increases intra-EU mobility. Those EU10 member states&#13;
that started with larger foreign populations, with the exception of Cyprus, experienced a&#13;
decline, mainly because of naturalization and out-migration of Russian speaking minorities&#13;
from the Baltic states (Bonin et al., 2008; Kahanec and Zaiceva, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The gender composition of immigrant populations reported in Figure 2.2 varies across the&#13;
European Union. Some of the most significant patterns include the under-representation of&#13;
women from the EU15+EFTA in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania and&#13;
Slovakia, possibly signifying a gender bias of migration tied to foreign direct investment.&#13;
EU12 migrants are gender-balanced in some of the countries with the highest relative&#13;
intake of post-enlargement migrants, including Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom. A&#13;
female bias is, however, present in Austria, Germany and Italy, which are also host to&#13;
significant populations originating from the EU12. Women also dominate the stocks of post-&#13;
enlargement migrants in Denmark, France, Greece and the Netherlands. Women generally&#13;
dominate immigrant stocks from EUN countries, most significantly in Bulgaria, Cyprus,&#13;
Hungary, Poland and Slovakia (although of these, only in Cyprus is the stock of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
     For Germany, we do not have data for foreign-born, so we cannot make the comparison.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      22&#13;
&amp;#12;immigrants more significant). The gender composition of other-origin immigrants fluctuates&#13;
around parity without any clear pattern.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Years since migration play an important role for immigrantsâ&#128;&#153; adjustment in host labor&#13;
markets. 18 Some of the most recent immigrants are those from the EU15+EFTA in Cyprus,&#13;
Denmark and Slovakia; from the EU12 in a majority of EU15, including Cyprus, Ireland,&#13;
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom; from the EUN in Cyprus, Ireland and Portugal; and&#13;
from other origins in Cyprus, Ireland, Slovakia and Spain. These indeed are countries with a&#13;
relatively short history of immigration in general (Cyprus, Ireland and Spain) or a short&#13;
history of immigration from a given sending region (EU12 immigrants in the United&#13;
Kingdom). Interestingly, some of the most mature immigrant populations are to be found in&#13;
the east of the European Union, mostly in the Baltic states but also others. This finding may&#13;
be explained by historical factors, such as migration within the USSR for EUN migrants in the&#13;
Baltic states, within Czechoslovakia for EU12 migrants in the Czech Republic and Slovakia&#13;
and, and within Yugoslavia for EUN migrants in Slovenia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To elucidate the skill composition of foreign populations across the European Union, we&#13;
plot the share of high-educated immigrants among various immigrant groups to the share&#13;
of high-educated immigrants among natives (see Figure 2.3). The diagonal line represents&#13;
equal shares of the high-educated among immigrants and natives. Panel i) shows that EU15&#13;
and EFTA immigrants in the European Union are more educated than natives in all EU&#13;
member states except for France, Finland and Germany. EU12 immigrants are in general&#13;
relatively well educated, with Denmark, France and the Netherlands receiving more&#13;
educated EU12 migrants, while Greece, Italy and Portugal receive mainly low-educated&#13;
EU12 migrants. Cyprus, Spain and the United Kingdom also receive relatively low-educated&#13;
EU12 migrants with respect to their native populations. We see in panel iii) that EUN&#13;
immigrants are generally relatively less educated than natives in EU15 member states,&#13;

&amp;#12;except for Finland, Ireland and Portugal, and relatively more educated than natives in all&#13;
EU12 member states bar Slovenia. In a majority of destination countries, immigrants from&#13;
other destinations than those enumerated above are relatively more educated than natives.&#13;

Notes: See Figure 2.1. Immigrant definition based on nationality for Germany. High level of education&#13;
includes International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 5 and 6 levels. ISCED 5 denotes first-&#13;
stage tertiary programs with an educational content more advanced than those offered by secondary&#13;
levels. They do not lead to the award of an advanced research qualification and must have a cumulative&#13;
duration of at least two years. ISCED 6 denotes second-stage tertiary education leading to an advanced&#13;
research qualification and requiring an original research contribution in the form of a thesis or&#13;
dissertation. For further details, see UNESCO (1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hard data thus reject the notion of generally substandard (formal) educational attainment&#13;
of immigrants in Europe. However, imperfect adjustment manifested as downskilling into&#13;
jobs of incommensurate skill level and the quality of education acquired abroad remain&#13;
important issues for the evaluation of the skill composition of migrant populations.19&#13;

&amp;#12;The labor market outcomes of various groups of migrants in the European Union are of key&#13;
importance for the costs and benefits of increased labor mobility within the European&#13;
Union and between other countries. Figure 2.4 presents unemployment rates for the&#13;
EU15+EFTA, EU12, EUN and other-origin immigrant groups. Again, the diagonal line&#13;
represents parity between immigrants and natives. We observe that EU15 and EFTA&#13;
immigrants experience unemployment rates not too dissimilar to natives in the EU15 and&#13;
lower in the EU12. The latter observation may be linked to migration of managers and&#13;
professionals tied to foreign direct investment flowing into these countries. The general&#13;
pattern for EU12, EUN and other-origin immigrants is that in the EU12 these exhibit similar&#13;
unemployment rates as natives, while in the EU15 higher unemployment rates are observed&#13;
for these immigrant groups. Overall, there is a positive correlation between the&#13;
unemployment rates for natives and immigrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A complementary indicator to the unemployment rate is the participation rate, as it, among&#13;
other things, captures the diversion of excess supply in the labor market to inactivity. Figure&#13;
2.5 shows that the EU15+EFTA immigrants have generally similar or somewhat higher&#13;
participation rates than natives, except for Hungary, where they have significantly lower&#13;
participation rate than natives, who themselves have very low participation rate. The EU12&#13;
immigrants generally exhibit higher participation rates than natives with a notable&#13;
exception of Slovakia. While the variation of participation rates for EUN and other-origin&#13;
immigrants across the European Union precludes any strong generalizations, higher&#13;
participation rates relative to natives are generally observed in southern and eastern&#13;
member states, whereas the opposite is true mostly in western and northern member&#13;
states. Poland is a notable exception with very low participation rates of EUN and other-&#13;
origin immigrants in absolute terms and also relative to natives.&#13;

Finally, we gauge labor market outcomes of the four studied immigrant groups and natives&#13;
in Figure 2.6. We specifically examine the shares of high-skilled workers, i.e. those who fall&#13;
into the top three one-digit International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)&#13;
codes (managers, professionals, and technicians and associate professional), in these five&#13;
groups of people across the European Union. As above, the diagonal line signifies parity&#13;
between immigrants and natives. The EU15+EFTA immigrants are generally, and especially&#13;
in some of the EU12, the group with the highest occupational attainment among all&#13;
immigrant groups and natives. EU12 migrants themselves generally work in less-skilled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                              29&#13;
&amp;#12;occupations than natives. As most of them are fairly recent, this may signify imperfect&#13;
adjustment and downskilling of relatively well-educated migrants (see Figure 2.3) into less-&#13;
skilled occupations. EUN immigrants, with a few exceptions such as Bulgaria, Hungary and&#13;
Romania, also fall short of natives in terms of their occupational attainment. The other-&#13;
origin immigrants tend to work in less or similarly skilled occupations than natives, but&#13;
there are a handful of exceptions mainly from the group of EU12 member states.&#13;
Comparing Figures 2.3 and 2.6, it is apparent that all immigrant groups, perhaps except for&#13;
those originating in the EU15+EFTA, suffer from significant difficulties transferring their&#13;
skills to host labor markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
An important aspect of European mobility is the extent to which the labor market potential&#13;
of migrants is realized. The study by Kahanec and Zaiceva (2009) shows that in terms of&#13;
earnings, immigrant men with citizenship of the host country suffer from a penalty of 5.3&#13;
percent beyond the observable characteristics vis-Ã -vis their native counterparts in the&#13;
EU15; whereas immigrant men without citizenship are penalized by 7.4 percent in the EU15&#13;
and 8.0 percent in the EU8. Penalties of similar magnitudes are found for women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other authors confirm a significant earnings gap for immigrants from new EU member&#13;
states in the EU15. In Germany, for example, migrants from EU8 member states who arrived&#13;
after their countriesâ&#128;&#153; EU accession in 2004 work 1.8 hours a week longer than their&#13;
colleagues from non-EU countries, but their hourly wage is on average 24 percent lower&#13;
than that of natives, just as is the case for non-EU immigrants. While more recent EU8&#13;
immigrants earn less than the pre-enlargement immigrants from the same origin, signifying&#13;
some labor market adjustment (or changing cohort quality), they work longer hours. 20 For&#13;
Ireland, a country that hosts the largest relative stock of EU10 immigrants, substantial&#13;
earnings gap of 18 percent is reported. Interestingly, this gap appears to be driven by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
     Brenke, Yuksel and Zimmermann (2010).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              30&#13;
&amp;#12;earnings differentials among more educated workforce. 21 For the United Kingdom, similar&#13;
patterns are reported, with recent EU10 immigrants working longer hours but earning&#13;
about 13 percent less per hour than natives and 9 percent less than their pre-enlargement&#13;
co-ethnics â&#128;&#147; indicating adjustment to host labor marketâ&#128;&#153;s condition or worsening quality of&#13;
immigrant cohorts.22 A study on Spain shows that whilst adjustment in terms of&#13;
employment probability in Spain seems to be hump shaped â&#128;&#147; with an employment penalty&#13;
as high as 22 percent in the year of arrival, a 25 percent higher probability of employment&#13;
for immigrants with five years since entry and about 5 percent penalty for migrants who&#13;
have arrived more than five years ago â&#128;&#147; there seems to be little adjustment in terms of job&#13;
quality. In particular, the probability of working in a manual job is consistently higher for&#13;
EU12 immigrants than natives, decreasing only after five years since arrival. 23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Segmentation of European labor markets also manifests itself in an uneven allocation of&#13;
immigrants and natives across sectors. We look here at six countries with some of the&#13;
largest relative populations of immigrants from the EUN countries and representing some of&#13;
the archetypal integration contexts: Scandinavian social democratic (Sweden); liberal&#13;
(United Kingdom); conservative corporatist welfare state (Austria, Belgium and France);&#13;
Mediterranean (Greece) and Central Eastern European (Latvia). Figure 2.7 presents the&#13;
differentials between the share of immigrants in a given sectors in all immigrants and the&#13;
share of natives in this sector among all natives.&#13;

Notes: Percentage point differentials between the share of immigrants in a given sector among all&#13;
immigrants and the share of natives in this sector among all natives. Ordered by differentials for&#13;
immigrants from EUN countries. Own calculations based on the 2010 EU LFS. In Latvia and Sweden, the&#13;
shares of EU12 immigrants are too small to calculate the presented statistics. Sectors are defined&#13;
according to the NACE classification (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European&#13;
Community): A: Agriculture, forestry and fishing; B: Mining and quarrying; C: Manufacturing, D: Electricity,&#13;
gas, steam and air conditioning supply; E: Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation&#13;
activities; F: Construction; G: Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; H:&#13;

undifferentiated goods- and services-producing activities of households for own use; U: Activities of&#13;
extraterritorial organizations and bodies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A distinct pattern arises across the studied cases. EUN immigrants are especially over-&#13;
represented vis-Ã -vis natives in: accommodation and food service activities; administrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    32&#13;
&amp;#12;and support service activities; manufacturing; construction; and transportation and storage.&#13;
On the other hand, they are under-represented in: public administration and defense;&#13;
compulsory social security; agriculture, forestry and fishing; education; professional,&#13;
scientific and technical activities; human health and social work activities; and financial and&#13;
insurance activities. This further corroborates immigrantâ&#128;&#147;native labor market segmentation&#13;
along the lines of Figure 2.6, with immigrants more frequently taking jobs in sectors that are&#13;
less skill-intensive.&#13;

There generally is strong correlation between the relative distribution of EUN and EU12&#13;
immigrants, with a few notable exceptions. In Austria, EU12 immigrants are over-&#13;
represented in human health and social work activities, whereas EUN immigrants are under-&#13;
represented in this sector. This finding is mainly driven by the large numbers of EU12&#13;
women taking jobs in domestic care services in Austria. In Belgium, EU12 migrants work less&#13;
frequently in mining and quarrying, electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply, and&#13;
accommodation and food service activities; whereas EUN migrants are about as or&#13;
somewhat more likely to be in these sectors compared to natives. While EUN migrants are&#13;
somewhat more likely to work in manufacturing, real estate activities, and administrative&#13;
and support service activities than natives, EU12 migrants are considerably more over-&#13;
represented in these sectors. In France, EU12 migrants appear to be somewhat more&#13;
segmented than EUN immigrants, over-represented especially in manufacturing and&#13;
household production, and under-represented in manufacturing, transportation and&#13;
storage, public administration and defense, and wholesale and retail trade. In Greece,&#13;
segmentation based on foreign origin is the most pronounced compared to the other&#13;
countries under scrutiny, with EU12 migrants significantly more frequently taking jobs in&#13;
accommodation and food service activities than not only natives but also their EUN&#13;
counterparts. In administrative and support service activities, EUN migrants are more over-&#13;
represented than EU12 migrants.&#13;

Notes: Responses to the question: What are the most significant barriers preventing ethnic minorities&#13;
from fully participating in the labor market? [no barriers; insufficient knowledge of the official&#13;
language(s); insufficient education; lack of information about employment opportunities; discriminatory&#13;
attitudes and behavior towards ethnic minorities; social, cultural and religious norms originating from&#13;
within these ethnic minorities; institutional barriers, such as citizenship, or legal restrictions; institutional&#13;
barriers related to recognition of foreign qualifications; other, please specify]. In percent of respondents,&#13;
ordered by non-EU immigrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some of the observed patterns of immigrant labor market outcomes in host labor markets&#13;
may be due to barriers to their adjustment and access to social and labor market&#13;
institutions. It has been argued that the generally negative attitudes towards immigrants,&#13;
mainly those from outside the European Union, may underlie some of their difficulties with&#13;
labor market adjustment. 24 Among the most severe barriers faced by immigrants are&#13;
insufficient language skills; discrimination; institutional barriers, such as citizenship or legal&#13;
restrictions; a lack of information about host labor markets; insufficient education; and&#13;
difficulties with diploma recognition (Figure 2.8).&#13;

&amp;#12;II.b The determinants of European mobility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The bulk of European migration is driven by job- and family-related factors. Housing&#13;
     and local environment are also significant for future moves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Among the main barriers to European mobility are linguistic and cultural barriers, as&#13;
     well as anxiety about finding a suitable job in the host country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Concerning the main drivers of mobility in the European Union, Bonin et al. (2008) analyze&#13;
survey data to conclude that the two most important factors explaining past moves in the&#13;
EU15, EU10 and EU2 alike are job and family related. Another important factor that is&#13;
singled out is education related, concerning people who went to study, acquire training, or&#13;
learn a new language abroad. When it comes to intended future moves, these are mostly&#13;
related to housing and local environment, social networks, and work and income, in this&#13;
order of significance, in the EU15. In the EU12, the same factors stand out, but work- and&#13;
income-related factors constitute the most important group of factors followed by housing&#13;
and local environment, with social networks coming in the third place (see Table 2.1). 25&#13;
Another study examines reasons why high-skilled migrants move in general. 26 Among the&#13;
main factors are increased pay, carrier opportunity or better employment (each above 70&#13;
percent of respondents), as well as enjoying new culture or environment, learning a new&#13;
language, and living in better climate or in a country with less crime.&#13;

&#13;
As for the macroeconomic factors, differentials in GDP per capita and growth rates,&#13;
unemployment rates and the overall standard of living are the key drivers of international&#13;
migration in the European Union. 27 Satisfaction with various aspects of life and work are&#13;
also found to be important predictors of international migration, with lower levels of&#13;
satisfaction correlated with a higher propensity to move. Together with a well-documented&#13;
observation that several new EU member states from Central Eastern Europe exhibit&#13;
relatively low levels of satisfaction with their life and job, this suggests that some of the&#13;
east-west post-enlargement migration flows are due to different levels of satisfaction in the&#13;

&amp;#12;old and new EU member states. 28 Structural mismatches in EU labor markets also explain&#13;
some of the observed migration patterns.29 A history of previous migration from the same&#13;
origin and existence of ethnic social networks in the destination country are consistently&#13;
found to explain migration flows. 30&#13;

&#13;
At the micro-level, Bonin et al. (2008) show, using Eurobarometer data about migration&#13;
intentions, that older people are less mobile than younger ones, women less than men,&#13;
families less than singles (unmarried without children), low skilled less than high skilled, and&#13;
employed less than unemployed. Past migration experience increases the propensity to&#13;
move. Finally, this study also highlights the role of â&#128;&#156;national tastes and preferencesâ&#128;? for&#13;
migration, arguing that mobility rates vary across EU member states also due to factors&#13;
beyond the observed differences in such areas as economic development, sizes of&#13;
immigrant communities and proximity. These factors may include cultural or historical&#13;
variables that condition current preferences or tastes for migration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Identified in the study by Bonin et al. (2008), among the key hurdles to international&#13;
migration in Europe are linguistic and cultural barriers, as well as worries about finding a&#13;
suitable job in the destination country. Interestingly, in the same study differences in labor&#13;
market institutions, housing market organization, or welfare provision and fiscal systems&#13;
across the European Union do not transpire as significantly important for EU migration. Yet&#13;
the authors argue that legal, recognition, portability and access barriers31 in the labor&#13;
&#13;

     Legal barriers include: those precluding entry of family members; recognition barriers those related to&#13;
recognition of diplomas and qualifications. Portability barriers are those related to the portability of social&#13;
security rights. Access barriers include those related to the access to the social security system, education and&#13;
health care, among others.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;market and in the domain of health care and social security, existing in spite of&#13;
harmonization efforts, increase the pecuniary and non-pecuniary costs of migration and&#13;
thus decrease migration propensities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.c The effects of recent EU enlargement on intra-EU migration flows&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 In spite of transitional arrangements, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements have&#13;
 significantly, but probably only temporarily, increased geographic mobility in the&#13;
 European Union.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 EU10 migrants in the EU15 are on average positively selected vis-Ã -vis the source as&#13;
 well as host populations; this is not the case for EU2 migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The 2004 and 2007 EU enlargements have changed the European migration landscape quite&#13;
significantly over a relatively short period of time. The share of the working-age (15-64) EU&#13;
nationals residing in another EU member state than their own increased from 2.0 percent in&#13;
2004 to 2.8 percent in 2010 (European Commission, 2011a). The post-enlargement&#13;
migration flows from the new to the old member states began to subside in 2008 and the&#13;
long-run effects of enlargement on EU mobility are, however, yet to unfold.&#13;

&amp;#12;Over the five year period following the 2004 EU enlargement, the number of EU8 and EU2&#13;
nationals in the EU15 increased by a factor of 2.5, reaching almost five million people in&#13;
2009, or 1.22 percent of the total EU15 population. 32 This increase in stock reflects&#13;
significant increase in migration flows from the EU8 from circa 58,000 annually over the&#13;
five-year period before 2004 to 256,000 annual migrants from 2004 to 2009, on average.&#13;
Migration from the EU2 increased correspondingly from 129,000 to 330,000 annually, on&#13;
average. Migration flows slowed done significantly in 2008 and 2009, most probably as a&#13;
consequence of the economic slowdown in Europe during that period (see Figure 2.9.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In terms of the share in host countryâ&#128;&#153;s population in 2009, EU8 migrants went mainly to&#13;
Ireland (4 percent), Luxembourg (1.7 percent), the United Kingdom (1.3 percent), and&#13;
Austria (1.1 percent). EU2 migrants predominantly went to Spain (2.2 percent) and Italy (1.6&#13;
percent). While we do observe some diversion of migration flows to countries that opened&#13;
their labor markets early on, such as Ireland and the United Kingdom, data does show that&#13;
transitional arrangements did not stop inflows from new member states. From the sending&#13;
countriesâ&#128;&#153; perspective, in terms of the share in source country population in 2009, the&#13;
largest post-enlargement outflows were experienced by Romania (9.9 percent), Lithuania&#13;
(5.7 percent) and Bulgaria (5.7 percent). 33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As argued above, labor market effects of these migration flows are â&#128;&#147; at least in theory â&#128;&#147; a&#13;
function of their composition. It transpires that among EU10 migrants in the EU15 in 2009,&#13;
26.9 percent achieved high educational attainment (compared to 15.5 percent among the&#13;
total EU10 population), whereas the corresponding figure for the total EU15 population is&#13;
only 21.7 percent. Even lower was the share of migrants with high educational attainment&#13;
among those from the EU2, at 12.1 percent (compared to 11.7 percent among total EU2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                               39&#13;
&amp;#12;population). 34 In fact, whereas the share of low-educated people in total EU15 population is&#13;
38.2 percent, it is 37.1 percent among EU2 migrants (compared to 30.6 percent among total&#13;
EU2 population) and 20.5 percent among EU10 migrants (compared to 22.4 percent among&#13;
total EU10 population). 35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These general patterns of selection indicate that EU10 nationals in the EU15 are more&#13;
educated than the host population in the EU15, but they also are positively selected vis-Ã -&#13;
vis their source EU10 population. On the other hand, EU2 nationals in the EU15 appear not&#13;
only to be less educated on average than the EU15 population but also the source EU2&#13;
population. At face value, such migration flows in a simple textbook model would imply a&#13;
negative effect of EU10 immigration on high-skilled wages (or higher unemployment) and a&#13;
positive effect on low-skilled wages (or lower unemployment) in the EU15. An open issue is&#13;
the extent to which the skills of EU10 migrants are transferable. An important related factor&#13;
is the degree and speed of adjustment of immigrants to the conditions in the host labor&#13;
markets. 36 In the case of imperfect transferability of skills (downskilling), and also for the&#13;
case of EU2 migrants, who in general were less educated upon arrival, the effects of&#13;
migration may be the opposite of what is described above â&#128;&#147; negative in the low-skilled&#13;
market and positive in the high-skilled market. Correspondingly, the effects on wages and&#13;
unemployment in the sending countries would be negative in the low-skilled and positive in&#13;
the high-skilled sector in the EU10 and the opposite in the EU2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Patterns of selection appear to have been uneven across an enlarged European Union, with&#13;
transitional arrangements affecting the scale and composition of post-enlargement&#13;

&amp;#12;migration flows. 37 High-skilled post-enlargement migrants were disproportionally attracted&#13;
to Demark, Ireland, Luxembourg and Sweden; whereas Belgium, Finland, Greece, the&#13;
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain were more likely to attract less-skilled colleagues. 38 The&#13;
patterns of out-migration from the EU8+2 appear to have been bi-modal, with migrants&#13;
over-representing high-skilled (except Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia) as well as low-skilled&#13;
(except Hungary and Latvia) populations, but under-representing medium-skilled&#13;
populations. 39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As migrants from the new member states are predominantly labor migrants, these patterns&#13;
of selection need to be understood in the context of supply and demand in the sending and&#13;
receiving labor markets. Differences between supply and demand conditions in western&#13;
(such as Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom) and southern (Italy and Spain)&#13;
European labor markets, the former mainly receiving EU10 and the latter EU2 migrants,&#13;
may also explain some of the observed differences in selectivity patterns between EU10 and&#13;
EU2 migrants. The migration decision is also conditioned by the expectations of the&#13;
potential migrant about his or her probability of success in securing desired employment.&#13;
Potential migrants better equipped to succeed are thus also those who are more likely to&#13;
migrate, which may also explain positive selection of labor migrants with respect to source&#13;
populations. Finally, several EU15 member states have applied transitional arrangements&#13;
towards EU10 and EU2 migrants differently. As more skilled migrants appear to have been&#13;
more distracted by transitional arrangements than their less-skilled colleagues, this policy&#13;
variation may explain part of the observed differences in selectivity between EU10 and EU2&#13;
migrants.40&#13;

&amp;#12;II.d Harmonization of legislation and the remaining obstacles to internal mobility of the&#13;
skilled EU labor force&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The EU has progressed in harmonizing legislation in order to facilitate internal&#13;
     mobility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Significant obstacles to internal mobility remain, however. These include:&#13;
     - transitional arrangements restricting migrants from the EU2,&#13;
     - administratively complex transfer and exercise of social-security and health-&#13;
         insurance rights&#13;
     - taxation issues&#13;
     - practical difficulties with recognition of foreign qualifications&#13;
     - discrimination of migrants in access to business services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The European Union has done much to facilitate internal mobility of EU citizens within its&#13;
internal market. Indeed, European enlargement and harmonization of policies in the&#13;
domains such as social security, pensions and health insurance seem to have facilitated&#13;
increased intra-EU mobility. This includes harmonization and automatic recognition of&#13;
qualification requirements in the health sector (doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives,&#13;
pharmacists or veterinary surgeons) as well as for architects; automatic recognition of&#13;
experience of professionals; mutual recognition for occupations requiring certain&#13;
qualification; recognition of qualification in regulated sectors such as commerce and&#13;
distribution of toxic substances; and harmonization of laws regulating self-employment and&#13;
the principal-agent relationship. 41 In 2007, a new Directive (2005/36/EC) that consolidated&#13;
and updated 15 existing directives dealing with recognition of qualification came into effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                      42&#13;
&amp;#12;An important area of harmonization is social protection, especially with regards to&#13;
coordination of social security rights and portability of supplementary and occupational&#13;
pension rights. Some of the achievements include the linear accumulation of pension rights,&#13;
meaning that a national of an EU member state working in a different EU member state&#13;
accumulates pension rights at the rate of 1/40 for every year of work abroad, according to&#13;
the so-called apportionment rule. The overarching principle is that migrants should not&#13;
incur any loss of social security rights as a result of their migration decisions. This, for&#13;
example, means that workers and their families receive social benefits in the country where&#13;
they work and pay contributions, and they have the right to transfer their social security&#13;
rights to another member state. On the other hand, EU regulation rules out situations with&#13;
migrants receiving the same social benefit or service from more than one member states at&#13;
the same time. Another important area is the portability of health insurance rights, in which&#13;
an important step was the introduction of the European Health Insurance Card. This card&#13;
provides access to medically necessary publicly-provided health care during a temporary&#13;
stay in any other EU member state. These rights are coordinated at the EU level by a&#13;
number of Regulations and Directives, including Council regulation 1408/71/EEC, Council&#13;
regulation 883/2004/EEC, and the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council&#13;
2003/41/EC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And yet, there remain a number of significant legislative, institutional and administrative&#13;
obstacles to free labor mobility within the European Union. These include transitional&#13;
arrangements still restricting the freedom of movement for workers from the EU2 (as of&#13;
May 2012). Second, in spite of the efforts to harmonize institutions and regulation across&#13;
the European Union, even intra-EU migrants often face significant administrative barriers.&#13;
These include complicated, lengthy and non-transparent procedures when transferring&#13;
social-security and health-insurance rights. For example, moving from one member state to&#13;
another still leads to loss of occupational pension benefits in some member states. 42&#13;
&#13;
42&#13;
     Bonin et al. (2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                43&#13;
&amp;#12;Another issue is the practical implementation of the European Health Insurance Card,&#13;
acceptance of which by the medical staff is sometimes less welcoming due to additional&#13;
administrative burdens that they have to incur upon accepting it. In addition, complex and&#13;
non-harmonized tax codes may lead to double taxation and often do not permit tax&#13;
deductibles if expenses are made abroad. 43 This is especially relevant for high-skilled&#13;
workers, who often engage in more complex migration trajectories. 44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Third, some discrimination of intra-EU migrants is also present in the business world, for&#13;
example in access to mortgage financing if applicantâ&#128;&#153;s place of residence, work or property&#13;
to be purchased are not in the same member state. 45 The often temporary nature of&#13;
employment contracts of highly mobile workers poses another difficulty when accessing&#13;
credit. Moreover, EU warranties on durables sold in the European Union sometimes&#13;
become difficult to claim or even effectively void after moving to another member state. 46&#13;
Fourth, recognition of qualification acquired in another member state is in some cases&#13;
difficult to achieve. The usual hindrances include the need to translate extensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
43&#13;
     For example, German insurance companies often do not recognize medical expenses made abroad arguing&#13;
that it is impossible for them to monitor whether the treatment was done according to German legislation. As&#13;
an example of problematic taxation rules, the German tax system applies split taxation for spouses, taking into&#13;
account their joint incomes, even if made abroad. Due to progressive taxation this may result in a higher tax&#13;
for cross-border families â&#128;&#147; effectively a kind of double taxation, as the family has to pay higher taxes in&#13;
Germany if one spouse earns money abroad, even if that spouseâ&#128;&#153;s income has been properly taxed abroad. In&#13;
other words, in such cases foreign income is taxed abroad and then additional tax still has to be paid in&#13;
Germany because of this same â&#128;&#147; already taxed â&#128;&#147; income.&#13;
44&#13;
     See the discussion in Kahanec and Zimmermann (2010a).&#13;
45&#13;
     This may include a penalty on foreign income for mortgage calculation purposes. For example, only 70&#13;
percent of foreign income may be taken into account for mortgage calculation.&#13;
46&#13;
     For example, a transnational manufacturer of consumer electronics offers an EU warranty on its products. If&#13;
one purchases a television set in Germany and moves to Slovakia, this warranty is effectively void, however.&#13;
The reason is that the German branch of this manufacturer only honors warranty if the product is used in&#13;
Germany. The Slovak branch only honors the warranty if the good is purchased in Slovakia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        44&#13;
&amp;#12;documentation, but also the practical implementation of recognition is often&#13;
burdensome. 47 In addition, the abovementioned directive 2005/36/EC does not cover&#13;
lawyers, commercial agents and the management of toxic substances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The potential of legislation harmonization at the EU and sub-EU level to facilitate intra-EU&#13;
mobility still appears to be large, given the relatively limited current mobility and significant&#13;
macroeconomic imbalances across the European Union (Bonin et al., 2008). This may be&#13;
even truer with the uneven economic developments across Europe during the economic&#13;
crisis of the late 2000s and early 2010s, which further exacerbated some of the existing&#13;
imbalances. The areas in need of further efforts include the transferability of rights across&#13;
national social security and health-insurance systems, elimination of hidden forms of double&#13;
taxation and ensuring recognition of tax deductibles across national borders, prohibition of&#13;
any discriminatory practices disadvantaging migrant customers and full recognition of&#13;
qualification acquired within the European Union in all its aspects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, mutual recognition of professional qualifications is a prerequisite for realizing&#13;
potential benefits of migration in terms of an improved allocation of human capital across&#13;
EU labor markets. Although downskilling may be a rational strategy for temporary migrants&#13;
in some situation â&#128;&#147; for example, if they do not find investing in mastering host countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
language worthwhile and rather take a less demanding job but work longer hours â&#128;&#147; it is a&#13;
waste of human resources if it occurs due to formal administrative hurdles. 48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
47&#13;
     For example, holders of academic degrees in some countries may have their degrees, in abbreviated form,&#13;
recorded on their ID cards. To register foreign degrees in this way in Slovakia, applicantsâ&#128;&#153; diplomas must&#13;
explicitly state the abbreviation of the degree. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, it is not customary&#13;
to state the abbreviation of the degree in the diploma, however. See also Kahanec and Zimmermann (2010a).&#13;
48&#13;
     Kahanec and Shields (2009). The argument is that from the point of view of a migrant, the costs of acquiring&#13;
country-specific human capital may exceed the benefits of doing so. For example, investing time and money in&#13;
mastering host countryâ&#128;&#153;s language may have negative returns if the costs of this investment exceed the&#13;
present value of the returns on language skills â&#128;&#147; the difference between income with such skills (work as an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        45&#13;
&amp;#12;The European Union has already made significant progress in recognizing professional&#13;
qualifications, including: harmonization of training requirements in the health sector;&#13;
mutual recognition of qualifications needed for professions for which minimal thresholds&#13;
are set; automatic recognition of experience for professions in craft, commerce and&#13;
industry; harmonization of rules for self-employed commercial agents; and recognition of&#13;
qualification for professions in commerce and distribution of toxic substances. 49 Directive&#13;
2005/36/EC consolidated and updated 15 previously adopted Directives in one&#13;
encompassing piece of legislation, except lawyers, commercial agents and manipulation&#13;
with toxic substances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In spite of the efforts to facilitate the recognition of qualifications, in many professions&#13;
migrantsâ&#128;&#153; qualifications still need to be recognized by the host country through a non-&#13;
automatic bureaucratic procedure. Worse, such professionals can be asked to exercise their&#13;
profession under the supervision of a domestically qualified worker for up to three years. 50&#13;
A related problematic area is licensing and formal qualification requirements for certain&#13;
occupations, often only serving to deter competition from new entrants and migrants&#13;
among them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Similar harmonization issues are shared by engineers as well as health and other&#13;
professionals.51 While automatic recognition of qualifications should enable the smooth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
engineer) and income without such skills (work as a driver). This is especially true for temporary migrants,&#13;
whose horizon of reaping the benefits of any such investment in the host country is short, and so is also the&#13;
disutility of the lower occupational status in case of downskilling. Another form of downskilling occurs when&#13;
even migrants who plan to invest in host countryâ&#128;&#153;s human capital need to take up less-skilled jobs temporarily&#13;
to support themselves until they acquire such human capital to transit into adequately skilled jobs.&#13;

&amp;#12;transfer of human capital, its practical implementation is seriously hampered by outdated&#13;
classifications of economic activities used to categorize eligible professions. Another&#13;
problem area, especially for architects, is the complex procedure for the notification of new&#13;
diplomas. A general issue is that while minimum standards are stipulated based on&#13;
educational credentials, the actual capability to practice a profession may also depend on&#13;
experience in the specific field. In addition, practical difficulties arise for partially qualified&#13;
or young professionals, who under general provisions may lose access to their profession.&#13;
Case-by-case evaluation of applications for recognition, when required, imposes rather high&#13;
costs on competent authorities. Finally, when applicants want their qualifications&#13;
recognized, they still face major difficulties in accessing the necessary information about the&#13;
evaluation process, including identification of the competent authority and finding&#13;
information about what documents are required. Limited use of electronic means of&#13;
communication with the competent authorities is a related problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the medical sector, recognition of qualifications is especially sensitive due to the complex&#13;
and heterogeneous organization of this sector across Europe. In spite of the&#13;
aforementioned harmonization efforts, many difficulties still remain.52 These include&#13;
differences in the content of medical training across Europe, as education, and with it&#13;
medical training, is a competence of member states. Although EU law regulates certain&#13;
minimum standards, national legislations specify the bulk of medical training as well as&#13;
access to the medical profession. The training time is still not the same for all the member&#13;
states. Importantly, the classification of medical specializations and terminology are not&#13;
fully harmonized across all the member states. For example, in some countries a General&#13;
Practitioner is confused with a specialization in Family Medicine, and so are general training&#13;
and basic training. Many universities offer programs that do not directly translate into&#13;
medical specializations. As the lack of language skills erects barriers in communication&#13;

&amp;#12;between doctors and patients, authorities in the health sector suggest increasing the&#13;
centralization of the control of language skills for health professionals treating patients. 53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The European Union has responded to these difficulties by proposing the EU Professional&#13;
Card, with the objective to facilitate the free movement of professionals in the European&#13;
Union. This should be achieved by simplified administrative procedures of qualification&#13;
recognition, higher transparency of the process and increased trust among competent&#13;
authorities in the member states. In 2011, the European Commission launched a Steering&#13;
Group chaired by the European Commission and comprising of representatives of member&#13;
states, professional associations and other competent authorities. Currently, discussions&#13;
concern a number of professions, including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists,&#13;
engineers, mountain guides and real estate agents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While this effort is certainly commendable, a number of concerns remain. For example, The&#13;
European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI) has highlighted the&#13;
variation across the European Union as to which professions are regulated, partially&#13;
regulated or not regulated. 54 Harmonization across the European Union requires&#13;
establishment of competent authorities issuing the card, but this may be difficult, as it may&#13;
not be clear who this competent authority should be. In addition, FEANI has expressed&#13;
concerns â&#128;&#156;that â&#128;&#152;a standardized professional cardâ&#128;&#153; will â&#128;&#147; by definition â&#128;&#147; be impossible to&#13;
achieve for all professions: different professions will require different criteria to be verified&#13;
and documented (for tourist guides this may consist in language skills being more important&#13;
than credentials in CPD [Continuous Professional Development] as is the case for&#13;
engineers)â&#128;?. 55&#13;

&amp;#12;In response to such difficulties, FEANI proposed a European EngineerING Card, which is a&#13;
professional card for engineers and is aimed at increasing transparency and mobility in the&#13;
EU engineering market. A broader approach to these problems is the harmonization of&#13;
degrees, their automatic mutual recognition and quality assurance in higher education&#13;
under the Bologna Process, which has not yet been fully implemented across the European&#13;
Union, however. A similar recognition of vocational training would be equally desirable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.e The role of EU labor market institutions, and their variation, in conditioning the flow of&#13;
skilled migrants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Minimum wages, hiring and firing regulation, and taxation interact with high-skilled&#13;
     migration in a non-trivial manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The variation of labor market institutions across the European Union may be an important&#13;
factor of migration flows in the European Union. While minimum wages probably do not&#13;
affect high-skilled migrants directly, as minimum wages are unlikely to be binding for them,&#13;
several indirect effects may arise. First, in the case of downskilling even high-educated&#13;
migrants may end up in low-skilled jobs. If downskilling is severe, minimum wages may&#13;
become binding for them and may thus affect their migration decision. In such a case, a&#13;
higher minimum wage may attract immigrants. However, as migrants take their expected&#13;
earnings into account when making the migration decision, it is also possible that a higher&#13;
minimum wage makes it more difficult to find a job and so deters immigration. Indeed,&#13;
there is some evidence of this being the case in the United States. 56 Interactions with&#13;
unemployment insurance, if eligible, may arise. In particular, a higher unemployment rate&#13;
may be less distracting for migrants in the case of generous unemployment insurance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
56&#13;
     Orrenius and Zavodny (2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                49&#13;
&amp;#12;Another channel through which minimum wages may affect high-skilled migration is&#13;
international student mobility â&#128;&#147; to the extent international students depend on&#13;
employment in low-skilled sectors with a binding minimum wage. Additional indirect effects&#13;
may arise through the interplay of low- and high-skilled markets in the receiving countries,&#13;
whereby a binding minimum wage in the low-skilled sector may engender a reinforcing&#13;
circle between high-skilled immigration and demand for high-skilled labor through&#13;
complementarity between high-and low-skilled labor and increased low-skilled&#13;
employment.57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hiring and firing regulation, as well as the regime of wage bargaining, may have non-&#13;
negligible effects on labor mobility. Labor markets with more flexible hiring and firing&#13;
regimes tend to be more open to immigrants. This is because migrants are quintessential&#13;
entrants into employment in host labor markets. The lower the costs of hiring, the easier it&#13;
is to hire a migrant; and the lower the costs of firing, the less concerned the employers are&#13;
doing so, as the costs of the potential need to fire employees in case of lower demand are&#13;
lower. The same argument holds for countries with more flexible wage bargaining and a&#13;
lower degree of unionization. One reason why Sweden did not attract significant numbers&#13;
of post-enlargement immigrants was its highly unionized labor market, dominated by&#13;
insiders and imposing high adjustment costs on immigrants.58 To the extent that any hiring&#13;
or firing regulations, or wage-bargaining regime, slow-down economic activity, they also&#13;
reduce the demand for labor and thereby limit employment opportunities also for&#13;
immigrants. On the other hand, positive effects on immigration arise if labor market&#13;
regulation or coordination of wage bargaining provide for a more stable and safe working&#13;
environment, or if trade unions channel information about employment opportunities to&#13;
potential migrants.&#13;

&amp;#12;Taxation may be another important factor affecting international migration. According to&#13;
the Roy model, countries with less (more) progressive taxation are more (less) likely to&#13;
attract high-skilled workers, ceteris paribus.59 While little is known about the effects of&#13;
taxation on the composition of inflow of migrants, one study has found insignificant effects&#13;
of taxation on migration flows. 60 Although some studies propose that more generous&#13;
welfare systems attract immigrants, which is the so-called welfare magnet hypothesis of&#13;
international migration, Giulietti et al. (2011) cast doubts on this hypothesis in the EU&#13;
context.61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.f Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EU integration and enlargement have vastly improved the potential for skilled mobility&#13;
within the European Union. Economic opportunities, structural mismatches in the sending&#13;
labor markets, linguistic proximities and distances, social and family ties and an&#13;
internationalized higher education system are some of the key drivers of skilled mobility.&#13;
Yet, a substantial part of the potential for increased mobility has not been realized. Some of&#13;
the main reasons are historically and culturally determined (linguistic barriers), but many â&#128;&#147;&#13;
if not most â&#128;&#147; have to do with the barriers still present in the design and implementation of&#13;
policies governing the internal EU labor market. This is true especially in regard of the still&#13;
problematic harmonization and transferability of social assistance and services, health&#13;
insurance and pensions, as well as the recognition of qualifications. Certain elements of&#13;
taxation (hidden double-taxation, complex and non-harmonized tax exemptions) often&#13;
increase the costs of migration as well.&#13;

&amp;#12;While many of these issues appear to have been well harmonized on paper, in reality&#13;
migrant workers face significant integration barriers and administrative hindrances,&#13;
especially if their migration trajectories are more complex (circular or multi-country) or they&#13;
involve family members (with their own migration trajectories). These difficulties appear to&#13;
be common among skilled workers, as they tend to be more mobile and thus their&#13;
migration trajectories more complex. This observation is very important in view of the&#13;
positive effects of intra-EU migration, such as those related to migration, as an adjustment&#13;
mechanism through which asymmetric shocks across the European Union can be absorbed.&#13;
If migrants work in jobs that do not match their skills, suffer from integration barriers and&#13;
administrative and other hindrances, and are separated from their relatives and friends, it&#13;
follows almost inevitably that many of them find their experience of working abroad&#13;
unsatisfactory. 62 Such dissatisfaction with the migration experience may then partly explain&#13;
the relatively low propensity to migrate in the European Union.&#13;

&amp;#12;III. The role of European Neighborhood Policy for skilled labor flows&#13;
III.a The European Neighborhood Policy: the institutional and political contexts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The ENP aims to promote mobility between the European Union and its&#13;
 Neighborhood through:&#13;
 - improved labor markets access&#13;
 - investment possibilities&#13;
 - intensified professional, educational and cultural exchanges&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The degree to which this goal has been achieved varies country by country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Mutual Recognition Agreements have achieved easier recognition of qualifications&#13;
 but difficulties with implementation persist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since its launch in 2004, the ENP has aimed to foster increased political and economic&#13;
contacts between the European Union and ENP countries (European Commission, 2010c).&#13;
This includes strengthened contractual relations by means of Association Agreements and&#13;
Action Plans, with the objective to provide support to ENP countriesâ&#128;&#153; reforms. Attainment of&#13;
the Action Plan goals by ENP partners is generally perceived as beneficial for the European&#13;
Union as well. Better economic development increases trade with the European Union, job&#13;
creation in the countries of origin decreases the flows of illegal migrants, and stable political&#13;
regimes ensure security in the region (see Section VII.a in the Appendix for details).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To promote economic and cultural ties between the European Union and the countries&#13;
surrounding it, the ENP fosters increased mobility and contacts of people. This is to be&#13;
achieved by means of improved labor markets access, investment possibilities, and&#13;
intensified professional, educational and cultural exchanges. Taking into account differences&#13;
in national labor and migration strategies, the ENP applies a differentiated approach in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               53&#13;
&amp;#12;shaping its visa and migration policy, employment regulations and facilitated labor&#13;
programs for ENP partner countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
More than two million Schengen visas63 were issued to citizens in ENP countries in 2008,&#13;
out of which 1.3 million represent an increase of 13 percent when considering the number&#13;
of visas issued only by the 13 EU member states that were part of Schengen in 2004. For&#13;
these citizens, however, access to new member states actually worsened, as these states&#13;
had to start implementing stricter visa requirements upon EU accession. This indeed led to&#13;
decreased immigration to these countries from ENP countries (European Commission,&#13;
2010c). The European Union has, therefore, simplified visa procedures for several ENP&#13;
countries, including Moldova and Ukraine, through agreements on visa facilitation, and with&#13;
Georgia and Moldova through Mobility Partnerships. However, the short-term travel visa&#13;
regime with southern ENP countries has not made much progress (European Commission,&#13;
2010c).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although the European Union appears to be fairly open to the liberalization of trade and&#13;
mobility of capital, it is more reluctant when it comes to liberalizing access to its labor&#13;
markets. In fact, the European Commission has little mandate to affect EU migration policy,&#13;
as this mandate is with member states. There is much variation in whether and how&#13;
member states have liberalized access to their labor markets for non-EU nationals, including&#13;
those from ENP countries. Denmark and the United Kingdom have, for example,&#13;
implemented point systems, favoring the entry of high-skilled immigrants. Most countries&#13;
offer special provisions for researchers and academics, and some also for foreign students&#13;
remaining after graduation. Most Scandinavian and western European countries also offer&#13;
tax exemptions for skilled migrants. Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Spain and the United&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63&#13;
     Schengen visa are issued by the EU member states that signed the Schengen Treaty (so-called Schengen&#13;
countries comprising the whole European Union except for Bulgaria, Ireland, Romania and the United&#13;
Kingdom). Schengen visa holders are allowed to travel freely within the Schengen area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      54&#13;
&amp;#12;Kingdom have a positive list of occupations and sectors for which access is provided more&#13;
easily. High-skilled migrants are exempt of market assessment requirement in Austria,&#13;
Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and also Germany and Hungary.&#13;
Immigrants investing larger amounts of capital or creating jobs are also given preferential&#13;
treatment in many EU member states. The European Commission has implemented its own&#13;
initiative â&#128;&#147; the EU Blue Card â&#128;&#147; providing access to EU labor markets for high-skilled&#13;
immigrants.64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some countries have been more successful in implementing their Action Plans than others.&#13;
For example, according to independent monitoring by the civic initiative Europe without&#13;
Barriers, the main problems for Ukraine remain in the â&#128;&#156;Document Securityâ&#128;? area, the&#13;
general implementation level of necessary benchmarks is only equal to 25 percent.65 On the&#13;
other hand, Moldova successfully implemented necessary reforms concerning biometric&#13;
passports and the travel documents system and this is attested in European Commission&#13;
(2012). The Georgian system of biometric data recording has been operational since April&#13;
2010. However, following a presidential veto in the Ukraine in January 2012, a law on&#13;
biometric data management failed to successfully pass parliament.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While Georgia is still tackling the issue of illegal migration and border control, Ukraine has&#13;
managed to implement 85 percent of the benchmarks set by the European Union in the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Illegal Migration including Readmissionâ&#128;? area.66 The implementation level assessment&#13;
relates to necessary legislative changes approved by relevant national authorities.&#13;
Successful improvement of legislative framework for border management in Moldova and&#13;
Ukraine can be attributed to expert involvement in the activities of the European Union&#13;
Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine. Georgiaâ&#128;&#153;s slower progress in Visa&#13;
64&#13;
     See Kahanec and Zimmermann (2010a) for a detailed discussion about high-skilled migration policy across&#13;
the European Union.&#13;

&#13;
                                                       55&#13;
&amp;#12;Facilitation Action Plan implementation can be explained by a later conclusion of the&#13;
relevant agreements with the European Union, which entered into force in March 2011.&#13;
Student mobility is an important channel of skilled immigration, and young researchers&#13;
from ENP countries can benefit from programs such as Erasmus Mundus (mobility within&#13;
university partnership), Tempus (structured cooperation for university modernization),&#13;
Youth in Action (mobility of young people), eTwinning (school cooperation), the Bologna&#13;
Process, individual mobility grants (Marie Curie Fellowship), scholarships (European&#13;
University Institute, College of Europe), the Euro-Med Youth Program and various other&#13;
cultural programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Special attention should be paid to Mobility Partnerships, as these instruments offer&#13;
cooperation schemes for participating countries not only in traditional spheres such as&#13;
managed migration, asylum and readmission, but they also focus on legal mobility and labor&#13;
migration. Local border traffic agreements between ENP countries and individual member&#13;
states promote opportunities for people-to-people contacts. Improvement of the&#13;
transportation infrastructure between the European Union and its neighbors contributes to&#13;
peopleâ&#128;&#153;s mobility as well. Training provided for border guards of ENP countries supported&#13;
by the European Union has increased border control efficiency and resulted in enhanced&#13;
cooperation with Europol and Eurojust.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In general, the European Union provides financial aid and advice to ENP countries, under&#13;
various financial instruments and projects, in the sphere of migration management, and&#13;
particularly in combating illegal migration. The projects are aimed at establishing relevant&#13;
institutions (such as border or migration services and asylums) and improving border&#13;
control systems and facilities. Specific examples include the European Union Border&#13;
Assistance Mission to Ukraine and Moldova, training for border offices in Algeria and&#13;
Ukraine, and funding the establishment of international section in the National Agency for&#13;
Employment in Morocco.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              56&#13;
&amp;#12;Over recent years, many countries have introduced specific mechanisms aimed at&#13;
integrating immigrants and providing them with better knowledge about the country in&#13;
attempts to promote easier access to employment for foreign workers. Specific efforts&#13;
include leaflet information available in different languages (in Austria, the Czech Republic,&#13;
Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal and Sweden),&#13;
online campaigns promoting tolerance towards immigrants (in the Czech Republic and&#13;
Poland), language courses (in France and Germany), preparation for passing basic tests on&#13;
the knowledge of the history and customs of the receiving country (in Denmark, Portugal&#13;
and the United Kingdom) and personal integration plans (in Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia&#13;
and the United Kingdom). In addition, educational courses for children and training for&#13;
adults are available in most EU member states. Furthermore, information centers offering&#13;
legal help, training and psychological support have also been established.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The European Union has sought for the unification of educational and professional&#13;
requirements across its territory in order to ease admission of students or employment of&#13;
professionals in different spheres. With this purpose, the European Commission negotiated&#13;
specific Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) with a number of third countries. As of&#13;
May 2012, 26 countries had signed MRAs regulating the recognition of professional&#13;
qualifications: Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,&#13;
Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the&#13;
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United&#13;
Kingdom and the United States. This makes Israel the only ENP country with an MRA with&#13;
the European Union.67&#13;
&#13;
67&#13;
     The MRA with Israel was signed in 1999 and entered into force on May 1, 2000. According to Tovias (2008),&#13;
during the negotiation process before 1994, the European Union was not willing to discuss mutual recognition&#13;
of diplomas and professional qualifications and sign an MRA with Israel â&#128;&#147; referring to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s small scale&#13;
economy and political reasons. By 1995, however, the bilateral agreement between the European Union and&#13;
Israel had paved the way for mutual recognition of certification procedures and laboratory tests, promoting&#13;
R&amp;D cooperation between the countries, which was later reaffirmed by the MRA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       57&#13;
&amp;#12;Apart from MRAs aimed at recognizing of professional qualifications, the European Union is&#13;
active in negotiating special types of MRAs promoting trade with ENP countries. For&#13;
example, Agreements on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products&#13;
(ACAAs) should contribute to the elimination of technical barriers to trade. These&#13;
agreements have so far been negotiated with Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Lebanese&#13;
Republic, Morocco, the Palestine Authority and Tunisia) and Ukraine in industrial sectors in&#13;
which the legislation is harmonized at European Union level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to bilateral agreements signed with ENP countries, recognition of qualifications&#13;
also involves agreements within international professional organizations. Increased&#13;
globalization of production necessitates efficient mobility of specialists across borders.&#13;
Delays in the mobility of professionals, due to testing, authorization or registration, may&#13;
hinder development in some sectors. International organizations of architects, engineers,&#13;
doctors, nurses, accountants and lawyers have concluded reciprocal agreements on&#13;
cooperation and have agreed on lists of recognized academic and vocational schools&#13;
facilitating international mobility. Some agreements also list exemptions from qualification&#13;
testing for members of professional associations. Harmonization of standards (and&#13;
consequently raising the standards in ENP countries), facilitation of cross-border reciprocity,&#13;
professional practice avoiding lengthy and costly authorization procedure â&#128;&#147; and thus more&#13;
efficient mobility of professionals â&#128;&#147; are some of the benefits of MRAs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On the basis of available studies 68, a concise review of approaches to immigration in&#13;
individual member states is provided in Section VII.b of the Appendix. The review shows&#13;
that specific governmental programs (point, quota and special card systems) do not&#13;
specifically target ENP countries but rather third-country nationals. EU member states&#13;
mainly apply three types of criteria defining high-skilled migrants: educational attainment,&#13;
&#13;
68&#13;
     IOM (2009); Bonin et al. (2008); European Migration Network (2007a); Kahanec and Zimmermann (2010a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     58&#13;
&amp;#12;salary level and skill level needed for a particular sector. In most countries, the following&#13;
categories of high-skilled workers are defined: managers, executives, researchers, university&#13;
professors, artists and athletes. The existing point systems for migrants (Denmark and the&#13;
United Kingdom) pay particular attention to the level of education; Austria, Belgium and the&#13;
Netherlands have organized foreign labor selection processes on the basis of salary&#13;
threshold. However, migrants from ENP countries may enjoy certain benefits within the&#13;
framework of special bilateral agreements concluded between an EU member state and&#13;
ENP country. These bilateral programs generally allow easier access to the labor market of&#13;
the EU member state. This leads not only to larger numbers of migrants between the&#13;
signatories, but is likely to improve migrantsâ&#128;&#153; integration into the host society by reducing&#13;
the amount of effort needed to cope with pecuniary and non-pecuniary costs of migration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III.b The patterns of skilled labor mobility between the European Union and the&#13;
Neighborhood partner countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Among the ENP countries, Algeria, Morocco and Ukraine top the list of source&#13;
 countries with the highest numbers of migrants in the European Union.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 As a share in host population, Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Germany and Italy,&#13;
 as well as Slovenia and the Baltic states, are host to the largest ENP populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 In spite of the high share of highly educated workers among emigrants from some&#13;
 ENP countries, the overall share of high-skilled among ENP migrants in the EU15&#13;
 tends to be relatively low. This is because the European Union is losing skilled&#13;
 migrants to the United States and other destinations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Irregular migration may negatively affect skilled immigration.&#13;

&amp;#12;In recent years, there have been significant labor migration flows from most ENP countries.&#13;
However, due to geopolitical and economic reasons, nationals of ENP countries have&#13;
followed varied migration patterns and have chosen different destination countries&#13;
depending on the migration opportunities open to citizens of different ENP countries.&#13;
Historical and political developments have had a significant impact on migration and&#13;
employment trends. While in the 1960s-70s, Europe was accepting large number of&#13;
migrants from countries south of the Mediterranean, the bulk of eastern European migrants&#13;
(primarily from Ukraine and the USSR) settled in Argentina, Brazil, Canada and the United&#13;
States, creating large diasporas there. In fact, the constraints of the Soviet regime restricted&#13;
migration flows from the East Bloc to Western countries until the end of the 1980s. The fall&#13;
of the Iron Curtain and democratic developments in the region opened migration&#13;
possibilities for nationals from eastern ENP countries. Subsequently, the 1990s were&#13;
marked by increasingly large migration flows from former Soviet states to Austria, France,&#13;
Germany and the United Kingdom, but also neighboring countries that were not EU&#13;
member states at that time â&#128;&#147; Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland&#13;
and Romania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Countries south of the Mediterranean have traditionally sent significant numbers of&#13;
migrants to the European Union. This has given rise to generations of immigrants in several&#13;
host member states of mainly Algerians, Moroccans and Tunisians in Belgium, France, Italy,&#13;
the Netherlands and Spain. In 1999, Moroccans accounted for 13.6 percent of the total&#13;
foreign population in Belgium, 15.4 percent in France, 11.9 percent in Italy, 18.4 percent in&#13;
the Netherlands and 20.2 percent in Spain; Tunisians, 4.7 percent in France and 3.5 percent&#13;
in Italy; and Algerians, 14.6 percent in France.69 In fact, the Moroccan community is the&#13;
second largest non-EU immigrant group living in the European Union, with 1,024,766&#13;
Moroccans in France, 276,655 in the Netherlands, 287,000 in Italy, 222,948 in Spain and&#13;

&amp;#12;214,859 in Belgium. 70 Latest trends in migration from Morocco show an increase in the&#13;
female share among migrants.71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
According to Eurostat data beginning in 2010, three ENP countries are in the top ten&#13;
countries of origin of non-EU nationals in the EU27 â&#128;&#147; Morocco, Ukraine and Algeria,&#13;
accounting for 1.9, 0.7 and 0.6 million migrants, respectively. In 2009, non-EU nationals&#13;
constituted 36.5 percent (7.2 million) of all immigrants in the European Union. 72 The third&#13;
largest number of migrants in the European Union comes from Ukraine; Eurostat migration&#13;
statistics shows that in 2010 migrants from Africa made up 25.2 percent of all immigrants&#13;
with the largest numbers arriving from Algeria and Morocco. 73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When we take into account available data on migrants from the region, we can see that&#13;
migration from the South Mediterranean countries to Europe is on the rise, with Morocco,&#13;
Algeria and Tunisia being the countries with the highest numbers of migrants staying in&#13;
Europe. For example, according to official statistics in the sending countries, around 2.7&#13;
million Moroccans, 992,000 Algerians (number provided for 1995) and 779,000 Tunisians&#13;
were resident in Europe already in 2005.74 According to another study, 4.5 percent of the&#13;
foreign-born EU population are Moroccans, 3.9 percent are Algerians and 1.7 percent are&#13;
Tunisians (1999-2003 census data). 75 The highest shares of ENP immigrants are in (see&#13;

     In general, the accuracy of available data concerning migrants from Eastern European countries, particularly&#13;
Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, can be questioned both due to reluctance of migrants to deregister officially&#13;
once they are abroad and limited national migration management policies. In addition, high numbers of illegal&#13;
migrants have not been accounted for. See Eurostat (2011, 2012).&#13;

     Ukraine is among top five countries by emigration in the world, having a total of 6.6 million of emigrants in&#13;
2010. Egypt occupies the 11th position, Morocco 16th and Belarus 28th (World Bank, 2011).&#13;

the other former Yugoslav states).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
With respect to skilled migration, out of all ENP countries only the Lebanese Republic is&#13;
among the countries with the highest emigration of tertiary educated migrants, and it&#13;
occupied the 28th position in the world in 2000. 76 Egypt was among the top emigration&#13;
countries for physicians, position 16, while the Syrian Arab Republic was 22nd. Very high&#13;
numbers of emigrants are found in the health sector in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, with&#13;
44 percent of Algerian, 31 percent of Moroccan and 33 percent of Tunisian physicians&#13;
practicing abroad. 77 Algeria and Morocco have contributed 3.5 and 3.1 percent of skilled&#13;
foreign-born nationals residing in the European Union, respectively. 78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Eurostat data on non-EU-born workers in the European Union for 2008 (both for recent&#13;
immigrants and for those with more than seven years of residence) show a peculiar&#13;
observation that skill levels are the lowest for the countries south of the Mediterranean.&#13;
Morocco is an extreme case, where a third of migrants do not have any formal&#13;
qualifications. Based on statistics reported by Docquier and Marfouk (2005) on high-skilled&#13;
migration to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members&#13;
from countries south of the Mediterranean, the Lebanese Republic demonstrates the&#13;
highest high-skilled emigration rate (the share of the number of high-skilled emigrants in&#13;
the total high-skilled population in a given sending country) at 38.6 percent, while Egypt has&#13;
the lowest rate, at only 4.6 percent. In contrast with the low emigration rate, the selection&#13;
rate (the share of high-skilled emigrants in the total emigrant population from given origin)&#13;
for emigrants from Egypt is 58.9 percent, compared to the Lebanese Republic at 44.5&#13;
percent. The Syrian Arab Republic serves as another example for a low high-skilled&#13;

&amp;#12;emigration rate (at the rate of 6.1 percent) and high selection rate (44.3 percent). Morocco&#13;
and Tunisia show similar moderate rates both in terms of high-skilled emigration rate (17.0&#13;
percent and 12.5 percent respectively) and selection rate (12.9 percent and 14.9 percent).&#13;
Algeria, Jordan and the Occupied Palestinian Territory are characterized by similar high-&#13;
skilled emigration rates (9.4 percent, 7.2 percent and 7.2 percent). Having equal high-skilled&#13;
emigration rates, Jordan and the Occupied Palestinian Territory are also almost equal in&#13;
selection rates (55.6 percent and 55.0 percent). Algeria, in contrast, has a relatively low&#13;
selection rate of 14.1 percent. Jordan and Israel have traditionally been countries with&#13;
lower emigration but relatively high selection rates. 79&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In spite of the high selectivity rates, Figure 2.3 shows that in the EU15 the educational&#13;
attainment of ENP migrants is lower than that of natives. Indeed, skill selectivity of migrants&#13;
is often not favorable for Europe. Egyptian migrants in Gulf states and North America are&#13;
more skilled than Egyptian migrants in Europe: 55 percent of high-skilled Egyptians going to&#13;
OECD countries migrate to North America. 80 Similarly, Canada, the Gulf states and the&#13;
United States are the main destination countries for skilled workers from the countries&#13;
south of the Mediterranean. According to Zohry (2008), although Egyptian migrants prefer&#13;
Gulf states or North America as their main destination, migration to Europe has recently&#13;
become popular.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Diversification of types and flows of migrants has started to be found. Migration patterns&#13;
have also changed in terms of gender, with an increase of female migrants into the EU&#13;
member states â&#128;&#147; both from Eastern Europe and Morocco. Similar to their male colleagues,&#13;
female migrants often suffer from downskilling. For instance, 36.5 percent of Ukrainian&#13;
&#13;
79&#13;
     Adams (2006) provides data confirming the arguments above that Jordan and the Lebanese Republic have a&#13;
large share of high-skilled emigration (defined as workers with 13 or more years of schooling), with the&#13;
respective selection rates at 55.6 percent and 44.3 percent. On the other hand, among Moroccan and Tunisian&#13;
migrants only 12.9 percent and 14.9 percent are high skilled.&#13;

                                                      63&#13;
&amp;#12;women in Italy have a university degree and professional experience as teachers, nurses or&#13;
doctors, but work in cleaning or care industries. 81&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since the 1990s, migration from ENP countries has been characterized by a relatively low&#13;
percentage of high-skilled migrants, while the numbers of refugees and asylum seekers&#13;
from all geographic regions of the ENP have remained high. However, due to the recent&#13;
enlargement of the European Union and new facilitative programs for neighboring Eastern&#13;
European countries, the share of high-skilled migrants has increased slightly. In addition, the&#13;
list of destination countries has diversified, as new member states started receiving&#13;
migrants from Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, including the Czech Republic, Estonia,&#13;
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia. 82&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Being the largest community there, Moroccan immigrants had a comparatively high rate of&#13;
employment in Spain in 1999 â&#128;&#147; 38.4 percent â&#128;&#147; employed in sectors such as market services,&#13;
manufacturing, agriculture and construction. 83 This sectoral allocation suggests that&#13;
Moroccan migrants in Spain tend to be less qualified. Studies have shown that the share of&#13;
educated migrants has risen significantly for countries south of the Mediterranean. Due to&#13;
higher level of education in the sending countries as well as improved access to higher&#13;
education in the European Union and also through newly established EU educational&#13;
programs, the numbers of educated professionals or students who remained in the&#13;
European Union after graduation are higher. For example, 41 percent of Algerian migrants&#13;
in the United Kingdom are high-educated and similar shares can be found among&#13;
Moroccans and Tunisians. At the same time, however, only 10 percent of Algerian labor&#13;
migrants in France have a university degree â&#128;&#147; with 84.1 percent in the United States. 84&#13;

&amp;#12;The low shares of highly skilled migrants from countries south of the Mediterranean testify&#13;
to differences in migration patterns into the European Union from the ENP region. Studies&#13;
have shown that high-skilled migrants arrive to the European Union mainly from North&#13;
America and Eastern Europe. However, while 38 percent of Eastern European migrants are&#13;
high skilled, it does not necessarily mean that they occupy positions corresponding to their&#13;
education and professional experience.85&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some studies argue that there are peculiarities in terms of specialization among the highly&#13;
skilled workers from the southern Mediterranean who tend to come from certain fields of&#13;
study such as humanities and social sciences. In Egypt, for example, 76.2 percent of&#13;
university students study in the humanities and social sciences. The corresponding figures&#13;
are 75 percent in Morocco, 60 percent in the Lebanese Republic and more than 50 percent&#13;
in Algeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Tunisia.86 These imbalances indicate that the&#13;
problem of downskilling may be in part due to mismatch between the skills that are&#13;
supplied by immigrants from ENP countries those that are demanded in EU labor markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The migration structure across countries of origin is also peculiar. For example, highly skilled&#13;
migrants from Ukraine are mainly young men and middle-aged women as well as students â&#128;&#147;&#13;
regardless of gender. Moldovan migrants usually include young married men leaving for&#13;
seasonal work, so the share of highly skilled Moldovans is relatively smaller, at 20-25&#13;
percent. 87 Concerning highly skilled migrants from Belarus, one needs to take into account&#13;
the difficult bilateral relations between Belarus and the European Union. Not surprisingly,&#13;
the number of Belarusian migrants â&#128;&#147; including seasonal workers or researchers and&#13;
students â&#128;&#147; is much smaller than from the other ENP countries due to various administrative&#13;
barriers.&#13;

&amp;#12;A specific concern related to migration from ENP countries to the European Union are&#13;
irregular migrants, who enter, stay or work in the host countries without formal&#13;
authorization by competent authorities. It is estimated that there were about 1.9 to 3.8&#13;
million (0.4-0.8 percent of the total EU population) irregular immigrants in the EU27 in&#13;
2008.88 The broader consequences of irregular migration in the social, economic, political&#13;
and security domain condition its relationship to skilled migration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The direct effects of irregular migration for public budgets include the costs of law&#13;
enforcement and policing of irregular migration as well as tax evasion. More broadly,&#13;
however, irregular migration also entails security and safety risks, such as human trafficking,&#13;
prostitution, forced labor or precarious employment. Another significant social cost is that&#13;
irregular migration puts the rule of law at risk. All these costs are amplified if they distort&#13;
incentives of the general population in the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On the benefit side one should mention the increased supply of labor, human and social&#13;
capital and possibly physical capital in the host country. 89 Irregular migrants, however,&#13;
often face severe barriers to their inclusion in host labor markets. As reported in Figure 2.8,&#13;
irregular migrants, just like non-EU migrants, suffer mainly from institutional and linguistic&#13;
barriers, as well as discrimination. Whereas language is the most important barrier for non-&#13;
EU immigrants, institutional barriers â&#128;&#147; rather unsurprisingly â&#128;&#147; come out as most severe for&#13;
irregular migrants. Such barriers seriously impede irregular migrantsâ&#128;&#153; access to all kinds of&#13;
public services such as education and training, welfare benefits and services, health care, as&#13;
well as services of banks and financial institutions. 90 Such a lack of inclusion impedes the&#13;
&#13;
88&#13;
     ELIAMEP (2009). The corresponding figures for the United States are 11.2 million or 2.2 percent of total&#13;
population (Passel and Cohn, 2011: 9).&#13;
89&#13;
     Obviously, some of these resources may be of negative nature â&#128;&#147; such as negative social capital used in illegal&#13;
activities.&#13;
90&#13;
     Kahanec, Kim and Zimmermann (2013).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         66&#13;
&amp;#12;abovementioned benefits. However, if irregular migrants are channeled into low-skilled jobs,&#13;
they become complementary to high-skilled immigrants in the labor market. High-skilled&#13;
migrants may be able to benefit from such complementarities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Irregular migration also tends to receive significant negative public attention. To the extent&#13;
this negative attention spills over to skilled migration as well, or is simply generalized to&#13;
migration as such, irregular migration may fuel negative attitudes towards migrants and&#13;
thereby worsen discrimination and other barriers to immigrant inclusion. Thus, although&#13;
skilled migrants may benefit from the presence of irregular immigrants in the host country,&#13;
they also suffer from a range of negative externalities irregular migration brings about.&#13;
These consequences of irregular immigration negatively affect and, in effect, discourage&#13;
skilled migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III.c The determinants of skilled labor mobility between the European Union and&#13;
Neighborhood partner countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Skilled labor migration from ENP countries to the European Union is mainly driven by:&#13;
 - lagging economic development in the sending countries (low wages, high&#13;
     unemployment and rising prices)&#13;
 - a gap in opportunities for personal and professional development after&#13;
     graduation between ENP countries and the European Union&#13;
 - a gap in access to quality social and health-care services and adequate social&#13;
     security programs between ENP countries and the European Union&#13;
 - high fertility rates (primarily in some of the countries south of the Mediterranean)&#13;
     causing migrants to seek employment abroad in order to support large families&#13;
 - educational opportunities and acquisition of language skills in the host countries&#13;
 - corruption, territorial conflicts, poor governance and state protection policy in&#13;
     the sending countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               67&#13;
&amp;#12;Three sets of determinants of migration can be highlighted in the context of migration&#13;
between ENP and EU member states:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       1. Determinants shaping general flows of migration.&#13;
       2. Determinants related to historical and cultural ties between sending and receiving&#13;
             countries depending on the region of origin of migrants.&#13;
       3. Determinants related to specific facilitative programs for skilled migrants in the&#13;
             destination country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Even though ENP countries are rather different in their political and economic development,&#13;
all of them face similar problems in terms of certain economic and social indicators: the&#13;
level of unemployment, access to highly paid positions, and opportunities to realize creative&#13;
and business potential. In addition, the level of democratic freedoms and human rights&#13;
protection in many ENP countries is still rather limited, which negatively affects the access&#13;
to employment for women and certain social groups. For example, the general&#13;
unemployment level among women in Morocco is 23 percent, while unemployment for&#13;
high-skilled women rises to a striking 75.3 percent. 91 Similar proportions can be found in&#13;
other Arab countries â&#128;&#147; Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Tunisia. 92 In&#13;
other ENP countries, freedom of movement is limited, making it extremely difficult to find&#13;
employment abroad â&#128;&#147; Belarus serving as a salient example. The differences in labor skill&#13;
composition across ENP countries discussed above also influence the proportions of skilled&#13;
and low-skilled labor flows to the European Union. Thus, diversification of determinants in&#13;
the first group should be made when country specifics are taken into account. In the&#13;
analysis, we adhere to the differentiation between push (unfavorable conditions in the&#13;
home country) and pull (conditions that attract migrants to the destination country) factors&#13;
of migration defined by Lee (1966).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                                  68&#13;
&amp;#12;When considering the general reasons and structure of migration flows, one can observe&#13;
some similar migration patterns across ENP countries: young single people are more mobile&#13;
than families (a notable exception is Morocco, 93 where family reunification contributed to a&#13;
significant shift from circular migration in 1970-1992); people with previous experience of&#13;
travelling or working abroad are more likely to migrate; and the unemployed or people&#13;
working part-time tend to relocate more easily than those with steady jobs. Such&#13;
conclusions can be made on the basis of the extensive study of labor migration&#13;
determinants conducted by Zaiceva and Zimmerman (2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some of the main economic reasons for labor mobility between the European Union and&#13;
ENP countries include the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       1. Lagging economic development in the sending countries (low wages, high&#13;
           unemployment and rising prices).&#13;
       2. A gap in opportunities for personal and professional development after graduation&#13;
           between ENP countries and the European Union.&#13;
       3. A gap in access to quality social and health-care services and adequate social&#13;
           security programs between ENP countries and the European Union.&#13;
       4. High fertility rates (primarily in some of the countries south of the Mediterranean)&#13;
           causing migrants to seek employment abroad in order to support large families.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The perceived benefits of migration to the European Union are higher salaries, better social&#13;
security and benefit systems, adherence to human rights and possibilities for professional&#13;
growth. 94 Migrant networks in the destination countries, as well as family reunification&#13;
motives, add to the pull factors of migration to the European Union.&#13;

                                                69&#13;
&amp;#12;ENP countries have demonstrated low to medium economic indicators (with Israel and&#13;
Jordan being exceptions). Upon closer inspection of economic reasons driving migrants&#13;
from specific ENP countries, one notices that the decisive factors for migration vary the&#13;
countries. For example, according to a field study conducted by the Egyptian Ministry of&#13;
Manpower and Emigration in 2006, the main reasons for leaving Egypt were low wages,&#13;
poor living conditions and a lack of employment opportunities. 95 One of the common&#13;
reasons for migration was observing the success of return migrants. This hints at the&#13;
significance of migration networks and the peer effect for Egyptian migration. Other studies&#13;
show the main reasons are the importance of the level of unemployment and, more&#13;
importantly, difficulties new graduates face in finding employment, as well as the possibility&#13;
of transit migration through Libya. 96&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since 1991, after the collapse of the USSR, and especially in 2003 and 2004 during the&#13;
Orange and Rose Revolutions, Ukraine and Georgia made substantial progress in terms of&#13;
democratization of political processes. Owing to the recent political developments, however,&#13;
the state of democratic freedoms in Ukraine has significantly deteriorated for the last two&#13;
years. 97 On the other hand, Moldova 98 and Georgia 99 have achieved some successes in&#13;
fighting corruption. A high level of corruption leading to uneven income distribution is a&#13;
common feature in most ENP countries. According to the Freedom House (2012) report&#13;
Freedom in the World 2012, most ENP countries were ranked either â&#128;&#156;not freeâ&#128;? or â&#128;&#156;partly&#13;
freeâ&#128;? due to geopolitical changes and shifts in political regimes (with the exception of Israel,&#13;
which was ranked â&#128;&#156;freeâ&#128;?). These developments conditioned some of the migration flows&#13;

A particular survey on migrants from Albania, Egypt, Moldova and Tunisia conducted by the&#13;
European Training Foundation from November to December 2006 provided detailed insight&#13;
into migration intention and determinants for these countries. 100 The study confirmed that&#13;
a lack of comprehensive programs for high-skilled labor migrants and the existence of&#13;
migrant networks in EU member states caused flows of primarily lower-skilled labor.&#13;
Existing research on the Lebanese Republic shows that low wages rather than a high&#13;
unemployment rate drive high-skilled workers from the Lebanese Republic to seek&#13;
employment abroad, while low-skilled workers are forced to seek employment abroad due&#13;
to limited job offers in their home country. 101&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Studies on prospective migration from Algeria show that migration is contingent on living&#13;
conditions and the level of education, as well as migration costs.102 In 2004, the&#13;
unemployment rate was about 4 percent in Algeria, including 1.37 million people between&#13;
18 and 35 years of age unemployed, of which 180,000 with university education and&#13;
350,000 with high-school education. 103 A study finds that that high unemployment among&#13;
university graduates caused increase in the number of highly skilled migrants from&#13;
Algeria. 104 In Morocco, high-skilled people also experience difficulties finding a job. The&#13;
unemployment rate is 23.5 percent for university graduates compared to 9.1 percent for&#13;
non-graduates.105 As in the case of Ukraine, there has been an increase of skilled, female&#13;

&amp;#12;emigration from Morocco, as highly qualified women are unable to find opportunities for&#13;
professional growth.106&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Language is one of the most important migration determinants for high-skilled workers.&#13;
Firstly, it determines the country of destination. High-skilled migrants are either fluent or&#13;
familiar with the English language, so Ireland and the United Kingdom attract many. Even&#13;
though English is the most widely spoken and popular language among migrants from all&#13;
ENP countries, France remains the top destination country for its former colonies Algeria&#13;
and Morocco. Similar languages make it easier for Belarusian or Ukrainian migrants to&#13;
adjust in the Czech Republic, Poland or Slovakia, whilst Hungary â&#128;&#147; a neighboring country of&#13;
Ukraine â&#128;&#147; does not attract as many high-skilled migrants, possibly due to language&#13;
difficulties. While learning the language of the host country may be a prerequisite for&#13;
getting a job that corresponds to a migrantâ&#128;&#153;s qualification, English functions as the working&#13;
language in some high-skilled jobs â&#128;&#147; regardless of the native language. In their studies on&#13;
the relevance between migrantsâ&#128;&#153; education and the remittance volume sent by foreign&#13;
labor migrants to their home countries, Docquier, Rapoport and Salomonec (2011)&#13;
indirectly corroborate that knowledge of host countryâ&#128;&#153;s language is an important factor for&#13;
the migration decision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Job availability is one of the most important pull factors. High demand for caretakers in&#13;
Italy 107 or for construction workers prior to the economic downturn of the late 2000s and&#13;
early 2010s in the Czech Republic, 108 Portugal 109 and Poland 110 caused large migration&#13;
waves from Ukraine. A lack of knowledge about employment opportunities or social rights&#13;

&amp;#12;of foreign workers drives a wedge between employment opportunities and their pull effect&#13;
on potential migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Educational opportunities in sending and receiving countries are one of the key factors of&#13;
skilled migration. The generally lower quality of the educational system in ENP countries, as&#13;
well as the problem of diploma recognition, urge students to actively participate in&#13;
academic exchange programs offered by the European Union or its member states. Kahanec&#13;
and KrÃ¡likovÃ¡ (2012) summarize international evidence on higher education as a channel of&#13;
high-skilled international migration. For example, Suter and Jandl (2006) show that in 2005&#13;
27% of students from a European Union member state undertaking their higher education&#13;
in the UK were employed in the country six months after completion of their studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some studies include prospects of higher productivity, alongside higher wages, as one of&#13;
the key factors for mobility of skilled professionals. For high-skilled professionals prospects&#13;
of career growth, promotion, improved social status, or access to professional networks and&#13;
support are important migration factors as well. 111&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In some countries, political and social push factors play an important role (Algeria, Armenia,&#13;
Belarus, Jordan, Libya, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the Syrian Arab Republic),&#13;
including a high level of corruption, territorial conflicts, poor governance and state&#13;
protection policy, a low level of political freedom, discrimination and abuse of basic human&#13;
rights. The regime changes during the Arab Spring in the early 2010s in Egypt, Libya and&#13;
Tunisia, as well as recent developments in the Syrian Arab Republic have significantly&#13;
increased migration flows from these countries to Europe.112&#13;
&#13;
111&#13;
      Driouchi, Boboc and Zouag (2009).&#13;
112&#13;
      These migration flows lead to a dispute between France and Italy and further discussions in the European&#13;
Union concerning changes in the Schengen system. The dispute broke out when Italy issued temporary&#13;
residence permits to 26,000 Tunisian nationals in April 2011, which prompted France to bar their entrance at&#13;
the internal Schengen border.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        73&#13;
&amp;#12;Migration intentions are indicative of future migration flows. According to a recent survey in&#13;
Ukraine 113 more than 50 percent of Ukrainians aged 18-29 would like to seek permanent&#13;
residence abroad â&#128;&#147; indicative of the lack of trust in future economic, social and political&#13;
development of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As discussed above, bilateral relations with countries of origin serve as an important factor&#13;
for migration. Selective quota systems or programs targeting high-skilled migrants have the&#13;
potential to increase high-skilled migration flows. According to several studies, skilled&#13;
migrants consider not only a skill transfer opportunity, but also taxation and benefit&#13;
schemes. 114&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The high level of remittances received by many ENP countries shows that financial support&#13;
for the family staying in the home country is an important determinant for labor migration.&#13;
The relevant data presented by the World Bank does not differentiate between remittances&#13;
sent by low-skilled and high-skilled workers, but it shows that labor migrants make&#13;
significant contribution to the economies in their countries of origin. Among the top&#13;
remittance-receiving countries in 2010 was the Lebanese Republic, at position 13, with&#13;
US$ 8.2 billion, immediately followed by Egypt, with US$ 7.7 billion. Morocco was 18th, with&#13;
US$ 6.4billion, and Ukraine was 21st, with US$ 5.3 billion. Interestingly, Moldova was 4th in&#13;
terms of received remittances as a share of GDP (23 percent), the Lebanese Republic was&#13;
6th, Jordan 11th and Armenia 26th, with the respective GDP shares of 22 percent, 16&#13;
percent and 9 percent. In spite of existing presumptions, some researchers argue that there&#13;
is no evidence that skilled migrants remit more. 115 More recent research, however, suggests&#13;

&#13;

                                                      74&#13;
&amp;#12;that higher wages and the legal employment of skilled workers could enable them to remit&#13;
more. 116&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bilateral cooperation of research centers and non-governmental organizations plays an&#13;
important role in migration decision for high-skilled workers. People who have participated&#13;
in research projects, workshop or conferences abroad may have more opportunities to&#13;
establish contacts and learn about the existing opportunities for further application of their&#13;
skills in the international setting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Skill mismatches in the receiving labor markets result in labor shortages in some sectors.&#13;
Such shortages may increase the wage premiums for migrant workers who possess the&#13;
necessary skills. Several EU member states, including Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Hungary,&#13;
Germany and Latvia, have experienced outflows of skilled personnel and are in need of&#13;
specialists in the IT sector, doctors, managers and other skilled professionals. 117 Staff in the&#13;
health-care sector is also needed in Italy, 118 Sweden 119 and the United Kingdom. 120 As such&#13;
shortages are hampering economic development, several EU member states apply&#13;
preferential treatment to high-skilled migrants, as described in the previous section. Such&#13;
preferential treatment facilitates further inflows of skilled migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overall, the determinants of migration appear to be similar for most ENP countries, but the&#13;
existence of historic and cultural ties between individual partners and EU member states&#13;
shapes specific patterns of migration depending on such contexts. Higher wages, career&#13;
ambitions and social protection seem to favor high-skilled migration. Although labor&#13;
programs â&#128;&#147; developed by certain EU member states and aimed at attracting highly skilled&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
III.d The impact of the ENP on skilled migration into and within the European Union&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Bilateral agreements and facilitative programs of individual member states create&#13;
 opportunities for skilled mobility from ENP countries; however, the shortage of skilled&#13;
 labor in the European Union has not been filled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The ENP devotes significant attention to migration issues, in particular enhanced migration&#13;
management, border control and the fight against illegal migration, since one of the aims of&#13;
ENP is to promote higher labor mobility through various instruments offered by the policy.&#13;
This involves, in particular, an effort to develop a coherent approach to tackle illegal&#13;
migration, asylum and refugee issues â&#128;&#147; rather than just a simple relaxation of admission&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Due to the progress in implementing the Agreements on the Facilitation of the Issuance of&#13;
Visas, concluded with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, the number of Schengen visas issued&#13;
to citizens of an ENP country is expected to increase. Some countries (the Baltic states,&#13;
Poland and Slovakia) have waived fees for national long-term visas for Belarusian and&#13;
Ukrainian citizens. Other instruments, such as Mobility Partnerships with Armenia, Georgia&#13;
and Moldova, facilitate legal migration to the European Union for nationals of these&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data on skilled labor mobility is mostly available for categories of migrants such as students&#13;
(who often declare their intention to stay in the European Union after completion of studies)&#13;
and young researchers. For instance, specific ENP instruments in educational cooperation&#13;
have enabled the mobility of students and young leaders under the Erasmus Mundus and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               76&#13;
&amp;#12;the Youth in Action Program. According to the data provided in European Commission&#13;
(2011b), a total of 108 students from ENP partner countries were awarded Erasmus&#13;
Mundus Masters Course scholarships in the academic year 2009-2010. Students from&#13;
Armenia, Moldova and Ukraine were the top three countries of origin, while Azerbaijan,&#13;
Jordan, the Lebanese Republic, Morocco and the Occupied Palestinian Territory sent the&#13;
fewest students). A similar pattern has been observed in youth exchanges and youth&#13;
workers mobility in terms of the Youth in Action Program: Armenia, Georgia, Moldova and&#13;
Ukraine are represented by the highest number of young workers, while the Lebanese&#13;
Republic and the Syrian Arab Republic occupy bottom positions. A total number of 2,988&#13;
young people participated in the Youth in Action Program in 2009. The comparative&#13;
numbers for 2008 and 2009 for both Erasmus Mundus and the Youth in Action Program&#13;
show a slight decrease in the number of students. In 2009, ENP higher educational&#13;
institutions received the right to participate in Erasmus Mundus Master Courses and Joint&#13;
Doctorates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Educational opportunities for students from ENP countries have been enhanced by&#13;
scholarships offered by the College of Europe (52 students from ENP countries received&#13;
scholarships in 2010) and the European University Institute. Scholars from Armenia,&#13;
Azerbaijan, Egypt, Moldova, Morocco, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Ukraine&#13;
participated in the Jean Monnet Program for the first time in 2010. Belarus and Ukraine&#13;
were already participants in 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Young people from Mediterranean ENP countries benefited from youth exchanges within&#13;
the Euro Mediterranean Youth III Program (it ended in 2010) carrying out voluntary service&#13;
activities in the European Union, although the numbers of volunteers from Egypt, Israel,&#13;
Morocco and Tunisia dropped slightly in 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Tempus, another EU program established back in the 1990s, and currently focusing on&#13;
cooperation with ENP countries, enables universities to realize projects aimed at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             77&#13;
&amp;#12;modernizing higher educational systems. Cooperation under the Tempus scheme also&#13;
includes teacher exchange. In 2009, the leader in the number of total projects was Ukraine,&#13;
followed by Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When analyzing the ENP impact on skilled mobility into the European Union, one should&#13;
consider not only steps taken by EU institutions or individual member states to facilitate the&#13;
employment of skilled workers from the Caucasus, Eastern European or South&#13;
Mediterranean region, but also individual efforts made by EU neighbors in order to improve&#13;
their education system, migration management policy and employment opportunities. For&#13;
instance, as a result of territorial conflicts at the beginning of the 1990s, around 25 percent&#13;
of the Armenian population left the country â&#128;&#147; which experienced a loss of skilled labor.&#13;
Since 2011, the country accelerated its cooperation with the European Union under the&#13;
Mobility Partnership. Due to stronger political will, the cooperation was enhanced and&#13;
resulted in a successful end of negotiations on the Association Agreement. These&#13;
developments have decreased the costs of migration to the European Union for Armenian&#13;
students and workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Azerbaijan serves as a counter example. According to an ENP country report submitted in&#13;
2005, it remains a country with a high number of refugees and asylum seekers as well as a&#13;
transit country for illegal migration, due the insufficient cooperation on migration issues&#13;
and lack of readmission agreements with the European Union. 121 Based on the observations&#13;
concerning the EU practice of concluding visa facilitation agreements with Eastern European&#13;
ENP countries, it can be said that in most cases (Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine), they are&#13;
concluded in parallel with readmission agreements, as the European Union pays specific&#13;
attention to the fight against illegal migration and transit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

      European Commission (2005).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               78&#13;
&amp;#12;Georgia, Moldova, Morocco, Tunisia and Ukraine have all demonstrated a readiness to&#13;
cooperate in the sphere of readmission and asylum policies and, by doing so, combat illegal&#13;
transit migration to the European Union through their territories. Cooperation with EU&#13;
agencies such as Frontex, Europol and Eurojust increases the efficiency of border control in&#13;
these ENP countries, although many border procedures are still in need of improvement.&#13;
Subcommittees and working groups on migration have been established in order to tackle&#13;
the most problematic issues such as illegal migration or human trafficking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Many ENP countries have made significant efforts in passing more effective migration laws,&#13;
which are described in Action Plans. Considerable improvement has been achieved in&#13;
institutional development, with new institutions responsible for migration management&#13;
being established as state bodies (such as the state migration service in Ukraine and&#13;
councils representing emigrantsâ&#128;&#153; interests in Algeria and Morocco).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bilateral cross-border cooperation agreements signed with individual member states eased&#13;
the mobility for local border traffic increasing border trade between ENP countries and the&#13;
European Union.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Many ENP countries are active participants of EU programs aimed at increasing cooperation&#13;
in spheres such as research and development (7th Research Framework Program, FP7&#13;
IncoNet EECA project), social and cultural matters (Anna Lindh Foundation for&#13;
Mediterranean partners) and other EU instruments promoting professional exchanges and&#13;
experience sharing, training, research, reform and modernization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ENP countries are also making efforts to modernize their labor markets in order to&#13;
overcome negative outcomes of â&#128;&#156;brain drainâ&#128;? to countries with higher GDP levels that offer&#13;
more opportunities for professional development. For most ENP countries, several serious&#13;
problems remain, however: unemployment still affects mostly young people and women,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             79&#13;
&amp;#12;the welfare state remains underdeveloped, and advanced technologies and research and&#13;
development (R&amp;D) remain limited in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data presented by Avato (2009) demonstrates that the low share of skilled immigrants&#13;
among the total EU population in 2000 was only 1 percent. _Thus, we can conjecture that&#13;
despite ENP and other instruments applied on the general level and individual selective&#13;
polices of member states, the shortage of skilled labor has not been satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Summarizing the impact of ENP on migration flows from EU neighbors, it should be&#13;
underlined that managed migration, including people-to-people mobility, is a declared&#13;
priority for the European Union in developing good neighborhood relations. Although it&#13;
does not address the skilled mobility in particular, ENP aims to find a balance between&#13;
attracting skilled migration from neighboring countries and mitigating the brain drain in the&#13;
region. Bilateral agreements and facilitative programs of individual member states create&#13;
opportunities for skilled mobility from ENP countries; however, the shortage of skilled labor&#13;
in the European Union has not been filled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             80&#13;
&amp;#12;III.e The remaining obstacles, perceived and real, to internal mobility of the skilled EU&#13;
labor force in the context of EU Neighborhood policies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The main barriers to mobility from ENP countries to the European Union include:&#13;
 - restrictive visa regimes and costly immigration procedures&#13;
 - difficult recognition of academic diplomas and professional certificates&#13;
 - strict limitations on the possibility to stay in the host country for migrants who&#13;
     lose their job&#13;
 - lack of information about labor market opportunities&#13;
 - restrictive immigration management, including binding quotas&#13;
 - language barriers&#13;
 - negative attitudes toward immigrants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For most ENP countries, international mobility starts with existing visa and residence permit&#13;
regulations. EU visa regulations are unified for the majority of ENP countries, with the&#13;
exception of Israel â&#128;&#147; whose citizens enjoy visa-free short-terms travels (for non-&#13;
employment purposes) within the Schengen zone, Bulgaria, Romania and the United&#13;
Kingdom. In most cases regarding work, Israeli citizens are also eligible enter the European&#13;
Union without a visa (with further application for a work permit) in order to conduct paid&#13;
activities in EU member states, with the exception of Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania,&#13;
Slovakia and Spain, which require visa for such purposes. Moldovan emigrants can also&#13;
exercise their right of abode in Romania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National visa policies help citizens from ENP countries to seek employment and to settle&#13;
more easily in their territory. For example, before the creation of the Schengen zone,&#13;
French national visa policy was favorable towards nationals of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia,&#13;
resulting in the creation of large migrant networks from these ENP countries. After the&#13;
Schengen system was established, nationals of these countries experienced more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              81&#13;
&amp;#12;difficulties in finding legal ways to settle in the European Union due to costly and lengthy&#13;
procedures of applying for a visa or residence permit. Similarly, after the collapse of the&#13;
USSR up until the latest EU enlargement waves in 2004 and 2007, Eastern European&#13;
nationals were settling in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia on the&#13;
basis of national migration and employment policies. After the ten new member states&#13;
joined the Schengen zone, labor migrants from Eastern Europe lost their residence and&#13;
employment rights and were forced to re-apply for visas or residence permits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Action Plans developed within the ENP framework define migration matters as one of the&#13;
key priorities for democratic reforms, focusing more on the fight against illegal migration&#13;
and effective border management, including seasonal migrants, rather than on promoting&#13;
skilled labor mobility between the European Union and ENP countries. The analysis of the&#13;
latest Progress Reports developed in 2011 by the European Commission for ENP countries,&#13;
on the basis of country reports and assessment of Action Plan implementation, shows that&#13;
the Commission emphasized similar problems across the ENP: elaborate coherent&#13;
legislation on migration, labor, asylum and refugee matters; enhance cooperation with EU&#13;
agencies responsible for migration policy implementation as well as international&#13;
organizations dealing with labor issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, ENP countries are at different stages of Action Plan implementation. For&#13;
example, Georgia, Moldova, Morocco, Ukraine â&#128;&#147; and partially the Lebanese Republic â&#128;&#147; have&#13;
signed readmission agreements with EU member states. The European Union stresses the&#13;
need for further readmission cooperation with the other ENP counties. Furthermore,&#13;
Moldova and Ukraine have signed the Action Plans on Facilitation of the Issuance of Visas&#13;
with the European Union, aimed at implementation of internal reforms on four areas&#13;
(including migration and readmission) that would lead to facilitation of the visa regime with&#13;
the European Union. As of 2012, the general indicator of Ukraineâ&#128;&#153;s implementation of EU&#13;
benchmarks in the sphere of combating illegal migration had reached 85 percent, which&#13;
testifies to substantial reforms in Ukrainian legislation on asylum, refugee status and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              82&#13;
&amp;#12;enhanced cooperation with EU member states in terms of migration and cross-border&#13;
traffic management. Cross-border agreements with Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have&#13;
contributed to better management of migration for people with the purpose of family&#13;
reunification, temporary or seasonal work. Substantial efforts have been made in the&#13;
sphere of combating human trafficking. At the same time, apart from educational and&#13;
research exchanges with the European Union, students or skilled workers from Eastern&#13;
European countries are not specifically targeted in general ENP policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
According to some surveys, visa issuance practice in many cases contradicts the goals of the&#13;
EU Visa Code or ENP perspectives. Problems such as a lack of a unified set of documents&#13;
necessary for visa application in different EU member state consulates, long visa processing&#13;
duration, high visa costs (especially where the consulates resort to the services of&#13;
intermediary companies), a lack of available information (particularly concerning categories&#13;
of citizens who are exempt from visa fees), a lack of information on refusal reasons,&#13;
inadequate requirements concerning documentation and a frequently offensive disposition&#13;
of visa officials towards visa applicants all result in a deteriorating image of several EU&#13;
member states and a rise in illegal visa issuance practice through intermediaries. 122&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Existing large flows of illegal migrants into EU member states and strict visa regulations&#13;
show disparities in the EU approach towards migration management policy. While&#13;
Ukrainians account for 9.2 percent of all visas issued by the European Union, Belarusian&#13;
citizens receive the biggest number of visas proportionate to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s population.&#13;
Another peculiarity of visa issuance for Ukraine is a large number of national as opposed to&#13;
Schengen visas, at 17.5 percent.123 As national visas are mostly long term, it may be&#13;
conjectured that high numbers of Ukrainians enter EU member states with the purpose of&#13;
employment or family reunification.&#13;

&amp;#12;The large number of visas issued to Belarus citizens indicates active EU efforts aimed at&#13;
improving bilateral relations and the democratic transformation of the country. However,&#13;
due to internal limitations, many potential skilled migrants from Belarus are not allowed to&#13;
leave the country (such as human rights activists and lawyers who are in open opposition to&#13;
the current political regime in Belarus). Efforts were made to improve visa policy for Eastern&#13;
European countries under the Eastern Partnership Initiative. As ENP covers different&#13;
geographical regions, Eastern Partnership can provide solutions that are tailored for Eastern&#13;
Europe. Still, this initiative does not include separate provisions on skilled labor mobility&#13;
from the region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During a recent round of negotiations with Moldova on the facilitation of the visa regime on&#13;
22 March 2012, the European Commission agreed on the amendments to the Visa&#13;
Facilitation Agreement, extending visa privileges for Moldovans. A very important step is EU&#13;
readiness to simplify the procedure of issuing one-year and five-year multi-entrance visas&#13;
for certain categories of people, including civil society representatives, businesspeople,&#13;
students and researchers. This means that the European Commission has paid specific&#13;
attention to skilled migrants from Moldova, even though the matter of residence permits&#13;
has not yet been negotiated at the bilateral level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Emigration from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia is complicated by the existence of frozen&#13;
conflicts on their territory limiting both internal and international migration. However,&#13;
increasingly higher numbers of students have the possibility to finish their graduate studies&#13;
in the European Union. While Georgia has successfully implemented reforms in terms of the&#13;
Visa Facilitation Agreement and Mobility Partnership instrument much earlier, Armenia&#13;
became the fourth country to sign the Mobility Partnership in 2011, thus taking practical&#13;
steps towards improving its migration policy.&#13;
&#13;

                                                84&#13;
&amp;#12;Turning to the issue of students from ENP countries, it should be stressed that the&#13;
recognition of academic diplomas and professional certificates has been a significant&#13;
problem for effective labor mobility. Existing differences on the level of academic&#13;
preparation of migrants compared to EU nationals and a lack of instruments to prove&#13;
qualifications due to different evaluation systems (a lack of credit system or appropriate&#13;
language certificates) both force labor migrants into employment in lower skilled positions&#13;
or in many cases undeclared work. This issue of brain waste raises increasing concerns and&#13;
it is especially relevant to migrants from Eastern Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The failed attempts to attract highly skilled people were acknowledged by EU high officials,&#13;
including the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, when&#13;
presenting the EU Blue Card Scheme in 2007. Empirical evidence for these claims has been&#13;
proven by numerous studies. 124&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While making migration choices, skilled migrants are often concerned about high migration&#13;
costs, especially at the start of the relocation process. In some countries, residence permit&#13;
fees are rather costly (Austria, Ireland and Malta), and the balance of migrant wages and&#13;
the cost of living is not always adequate. Fees for the services of private agencies mediating&#13;
mobility to the European Union add to the expense.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In many cases, skilled workers are not informed about the possibilities to seek employment&#13;
in EU member states if their contract is terminated and are forced either to return to their&#13;
country of origin or stay illegally. 125 The issue of continuous employability is perceived as a&#13;
threat to the social benefits system: if member states allow foreign migrants to seek&#13;
employment for a longer period of time, the burden of supporting them may lay on the&#13;
social security system (a worrying numbers of migrants resorting to benefits in the United&#13;

&amp;#12;Kingdom may serve as an example). On the other hand, in many cases skilled workers with&#13;
enough savings would appreciate the availability of a certain period to find a new job before&#13;
they are forced to leave the European Union. Rigid interdependency between work and&#13;
residence permits hinders the mobility of skilled labor within the European Union.&#13;
The quota system and labor market or economic needs tests yield questionable results in&#13;
the member statesâ&#128;&#153; attempts to attract skilled labor or simplify the process of employing&#13;
foreign labor. Although quotas provide safety brakes in case of significant disruptions to the&#13;
labor market, thus comforting policy makers, they also may be too rigid in case of the need&#13;
for restructuring in the labor market. In addition, it is analytically challenging to tie quotas&#13;
to true labor market needs, which also may change rapidly, and thus any quota system is&#13;
unlikely to reflect them. The practice of labor market tests is often aimed at protecting&#13;
domestic workers and usually deters employment procedure for skilled migrants even if no&#13;
national worker applied for the position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While the point system used in several EU member states generally provides an effective&#13;
way of recruiting skilled migrants, some criteria, such as the inclusion of the salary criterion,&#13;
may limit the chances of some types of skilled foreign migrants. A lack of a unified approach&#13;
creates obstacles in defining the necessary skills to be employed abroad. If one applies the&#13;
education criterion, then the differences in educational systems between EU member states&#13;
and ENP countries should be taken into account (e.g. Armenia, Belarus and Ukraine still use&#13;
different systems to qualify educational and academic degrees, universities there do not&#13;
apply the credit system, etc.). If salary is considered as the main factor, then employers are&#13;
the main assessors of migrantsâ&#128;&#153; skills, which raises concerns about possible subjectivity or&#13;
possibilities of fraud being committed in order to obtain residence documentation. In&#13;
September 2011, the UK Border Agency arrested British nationals on suspicion of&#13;
immigration fraud. The suspects were allegedly evading the visa system by artificially&#13;
inflating wages, enabling qualification for visas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               86&#13;
&amp;#12;The â&#128;&#156;outstanding skillsâ&#128;? criterion is rather vaguely defined. According to it, migrant workers&#13;
must possess special types of skills that are either in high demand in the receiving country&#13;
or that are not common to EU member state nationals. If the demand for foreign skilled&#13;
labor in some sectors is defined on the general EU level and by individual member states,&#13;
the issue of a labor market test (migrants to be recruited only after it is proven that national&#13;
workers are not suitable for the positions) is a rather controversial one. Specifically, the&#13;
need for native language speakers from ENP countries for customer service sector does not&#13;
necessarily imply the employment of skilled workers (as even migrants without tertiary&#13;
education or professional experience can be recruited as long as they speak the required&#13;
language), while the need for employees at higher managerial positions possessing certain&#13;
foreign language skills raises the chances for skilled labor mobility from the region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reasons that shape negative decisions to take up employment in the European Union&#13;
include complicated procedures and high costs of obtaining a visa or residence permit,&#13;
difficulties in finding housing, reluctance of employers to provide social security benefits,&#13;
complex taxation, a lack of access to public facilities (health care, education, training and&#13;
banking), non-recognition of educational and professional certifications from the country of&#13;
origin, and the impossibility to transfer pension payments to the country of origin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge of host countryâ&#128;&#153;s language conditions migration and employment opportunities.&#13;
On the other hand, qualified professionals from ENP countries, for example, engineers and&#13;
doctors from Eastern Europe, are often limited in their choice of employment due to a poor&#13;
knowledge of host countryâ&#128;&#153;s language. Although command of English may in some types of&#13;
occupations help to overcome such linguistic barriers, in many others â&#128;&#147; especially if country-&#13;
specific knowledge or interaction with local clients is part of the job â&#128;&#147; this is not the case.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The political, social and cultural climate in the receiving state is also important for further&#13;
integration of skilled labor. The attitude towards migrants coupled with employersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
assessments can have a significant impact on migration intentions and decisions. For&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               87&#13;
&amp;#12;example, German employers report that language problems, socio-cultural differences,&#13;
acceptance by superiors and customers, high recruitment costs and a lack of awareness to&#13;
evaluate the experience and assess the level of education are one of the most common&#13;
problems when recruiting foreign workers. 126 Other studies show that negative attitudes&#13;
towards immigrants undermine migrantsâ&#128;&#153; aspirations to acquire host countryâ&#128;&#153;s citizenship;&#13;
and this is especially true for more skilled, younger and employed immigrants. 127&#13;
Some immigrants from ENP countries acquire citizenship of their host countries in the&#13;
European Union. While citizenship acquisition eliminates many of the barriers mentioned&#13;
above, the discussion in Section II.d demonstrates that a number of barriers to internal&#13;
mobility in the European Union still adversely affect the migration decisions of naturalized&#13;
ENP immigrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III.f Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EU Neighborhood policies may increase the potential to attract skilled immigration, and&#13;
thus alleviate some of the European Unionâ&#128;&#153;s demographic challenges and skill shortages,&#13;
increase the European Unionâ&#128;&#153;s innovation potential and economic dynamics, and provide&#13;
for a more mobile layer of skilled migrants in the European Union. The restrictive&#13;
immigration policies currently applied in the European Union seem to hinder this potential,&#13;
especially because of far too many institutional and legislative barriers to immigration and&#13;
integration of non-EU immigrants.&#13;

&amp;#12;IV. The labor market effects of skilled EU labor flows in sending and receiving countries in&#13;
the European Union&#13;
IV.a A theoretical and conceptual framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Among the potential economic effects of immigration are:&#13;
  - effects on the distribution of earnings&#13;
  - increased allocative efficiency in the labor market&#13;
  - improved flow of ideas, knowledge and technology, goods and services, as well as&#13;
         capital&#13;
  - increased diversity of the labor force&#13;
  - effects on public finance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The scale and skill composition of migration flows, their temporal character, the&#13;
  speed of immigrantsâ&#128;&#153; adjustment in host labor markets, and labor market institutions&#13;
  determine the scale and nature of these effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To shed light on the labor market effects of migration flows, it is useful to briefly review the&#13;
arguments proposed in the literature. These insights will guide us through empirical&#13;
evidence reviewed in the subsequent section. Consider a sending and a receiving country,&#13;
each with complementary high- and low-skilled workers working in the corresponding&#13;
competitive high- and low-skilled sectors.128 We also consider the possibility of a binding&#13;
minimum wage in the low-skilled sector to illustrate the consequences of downward-rigidity&#13;
of wages for the effects of migration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
128&#13;
      Kahanec (2013). Within each sector immigrant and native workers are assumed to be perfectly&#13;
substitutable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       89&#13;
&amp;#12;Under these assumptions, high-skilled immigration diminishes the relative scarcity of high-&#13;
skilled workers and thus lowers the wage in the high-skilled sector. On the other hand, it&#13;
benefits low-skilled workers in the receiving country by increasing the demand for their&#13;
labor (e.g. an inflow of medical doctors drives hospitals to employ more patient care&#13;
assistants in order to provide care for patients treated by the newly employed doctors). As a&#13;
consequence, both wages and employment rise in a competitive low-skilled sector. If the&#13;
low-skilled sector were not competitive â&#128;&#147; constrained by a binding minimum wage â&#128;&#147;&#13;
employment would rise and unemployment fall. In the health-care sector, for example,&#13;
some patient care assistants would initially be unable to find an employer willing to pay&#13;
them even the minimum wage, but increased demand for their services facilitates&#13;
employment for some of them. Wages in a non-competitive low-skilled sector would go up&#13;
only if the increased demand would be high enough to drive the wage above the minimum&#13;
wage, thus making it non-binding. This would occur if the number of demanded patient care&#13;
assistants exceeded the number of those willing to accept job at the minimum wage, and&#13;
employers would need to pay more than the minimum wage to hire additional ones. The&#13;
ultimate effect on wages in the high-skilled sector is in fact ambiguous, because any&#13;
increase in employment in the low-skilled sector feeds back into the high-skilled sector&#13;
through complementarity of low- and high-skilled labor, and to an extent offsets the initial&#13;
decrease in high-skilled wages. A larger number of newly hired patient care assistants&#13;
increase the productivity of medical doctors, which in turn motivates hospitals to demand&#13;
more of them, raising their wages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, low-skilled immigration generally benefits high-skilled natives and possibly, but&#13;
not necessarily, hurts low-skilled ones. By the same token, high-skilled out-migration&#13;
benefits high-skilled stayers but hurts the low-skilled ones in terms of lower wages and&#13;
employment, or higher unemployment in case of a binding minimum wage. Any resulting&#13;
decrease of employment in the low-skilled sector offsets the positive effect on the wages of&#13;
high-skilled stayers to some extent, thus making the effects on high-skilled wages&#13;
ambiguous. Finally, low-skilled out-migration increases the wages of low-skilled stayers; or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              90&#13;
&amp;#12;it decreases their unemployment in case of a binding minimum wage. In the former case,&#13;
the decreased employment in the low-skilled sector reduces the demand for high-skilled&#13;
workers, and thus their wage and employment. 129&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While a review of the redistributive effects of migration predicted by textbook economic&#13;
models is a good starting point, a number of other factors may interfere with or even&#13;
reverse these predictions. Economic migration improves the allocative efficiency of the&#13;
labor market inasmuch as it is driven by search for â&#128;&#147; and results in realization of â&#128;&#147; more&#13;
productive employment opportunities. Migration proliferates social and family ties that&#13;
span across national borders. Because such ties facilitate the flow of information, trade and&#13;
investment, migration is also a vehicle of international flows of ideas, knowledge and&#13;
technology, goods and services, and capital (see the review in Bonin et al., 2008). Migration&#13;
may also benefit the economy through increased diversity of the labor force (Ottaviano and&#13;
Peri, 2006). Based on these arguments, migration may increase factor productivity in the&#13;
receiving and sending countries and thus benefit all types of labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
However, some of the positive effects of migration may be hindered by a gamut of&#13;
legislative, institutional, linguistic or psychological barriers, and discrimination, which&#13;
encumber immigrant adjustment in the host labor market (Constant, Kahanec and&#13;
Zimmermann, 2009; Kahanec, Kim and Zimmermann, 2013). Imperfect transferability of&#13;
skills across national borders is an archetypal source of underutilization of migrant abilities&#13;
and skills in jobs below their level of qualification, the so-called downskilling. 130 In view of&#13;
the importance of the skill composition of migration flows for the effects of migration, the&#13;
speed at which migrants adjust and overcome any hindrances to full utilization of their skills&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
129&#13;
      See Kahanec and Zimmerman (2009) for more on redistributive effects of migration.&#13;
130&#13;
      Kahanec, Zaiceva and Zimmermann (2010) discuss downskilling in the context of the 2004 and 2007 EU&#13;
enlargements. The transferability of skills concerns also adjustment of migrants if they decide to return to&#13;
their country of origin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       91&#13;
&amp;#12;not only determines the nature of the effects of migration in host, but also source labor&#13;
markets, such as through effects on aggregate demand, remittances or return migration.131&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The temporal nature of migration â&#128;&#147; whether it is permanent, temporary or circular â&#128;&#147; is of&#13;
key importance for receiving as well as sending countries. In the context of intra-EU&#13;
migration, migration can alleviate some of the existing demographic imbalances and skill-&#13;
mismatches, although it is also clear that intra-EU migration alone cannot solve the&#13;
problems of aging and shrinking young cohorts in the European Union.132 The outflow of&#13;
young and skilled workers from the new member states engenders risks for the&#13;
sustainability of public finances in these countries. For these countries, the question is how&#13;
many migrants will return and with what human (and social and physical) capital. As post-&#13;
enlargement migrants mostly report temporary migration intentions, 133 for the sending&#13;
countries the potential for brain circulation and positive human capital gains, and thus&#13;
improved prospects for their public finance, is high. However, it remains to be seen whether&#13;
the primarily temporary intentions of post-enlargement migrants will also translate into&#13;
their return and circular migration. Recent evidence signals that large numbers of post-&#13;
enlargement migrants are returning back home or moving to another member state, also in&#13;
relation to changing economic landscape in Europe during the crisis of the late 2000s and&#13;
early 2010s. 134&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From the perspective of the European Union as a recipient of immigrants from the ENP and&#13;
other countries, similar points arise. It may seem at first glance that the immigration of&#13;
workers is unequivocally beneficial for the sustainability of public finance. 135 Indeed, it&#13;
&#13;
131&#13;
      See Kahanec and Zimmermann (2009) for a discussion about immigrant adjustment.&#13;
132&#13;
      Bonin et al. (2008).&#13;

      Kahanec and Zimmermann (2010b).&#13;
134&#13;
      Kahanec (2013).&#13;
135&#13;
      Several studies find that immigrants are net contributors to public finance, but the opposite evidence also&#13;
exists. See Legrain (2008) for a discussion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         92&#13;
&amp;#12;increases the size of the active labor force, which pays taxes and contributes to the social&#13;
security system. In addition, their education has already been paid by someone else than&#13;
the host countryâ&#128;&#153;s public budget. However, migrants tend to have lower wages and higher&#13;
unemployment rates than natives. 136 One also needs to understand the effects of migration&#13;
from the dynamic perspective and, in particular, that migrants also age. The distinction&#13;
between temporary and permanent migration is of central importance in this debate.&#13;
Permanent migrants affect the demography of the host country by increasing the size of the&#13;
labor force but also by increasing the size of future cohorts of retirees. In case of permanent&#13;
migration, a sufficiently strong stream of new immigrants is thus needed to compensate for&#13;
the aging of previous immigrant waves. 137&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Temporary and circular migration, on the other hand, implies the departure of migrants&#13;
after some time, typically after they lose or quit their job in favor of a more attractive&#13;
alternative elsewhere, or if they retire. Temporary labor migrants directly improve the&#13;
demographic balance of the host economy by expanding its labor force during their stay,&#13;
but generally not affecting the size of the future labor force or retired population. Of key&#13;
importance for the ramifications of temporary migration for the sustainability of public&#13;
finance is the regulation of the future access of return migrants to the pension rights&#13;
accumulated in the host country. In case of portability of pension rights, the costs of future&#13;
pensions and aging of temporary migrants clearly need to be accounted for in evaluation of&#13;
the effects of temporary migration on host economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The interplay of the pension system, portability of pension rights and the temporal nature&#13;
migration is a key factor in the debate about the consequences of immigration for the&#13;
sustainability of the pension system. For example, significant risks may arise for host&#13;
136&#13;
      Kahanec and Zaiceva (2009).&#13;
137&#13;
      Fertility rates above those of natives are an alternative remedy for the problem of immigrant aging. At the&#13;
same time, however, increased fertility rates pose additional burden on public finance through higher demand&#13;
for education and other public services for families with children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         93&#13;
&amp;#12;countries with pay-as-you-go pension systems (distributing current revenues of the pension&#13;
system to current pensioners) in the case of shrinking immigration. This is because pension&#13;
rights accumulated in times of large immigrant inflows and therefore larger labor force will&#13;
need to be honored (to the extent they are portable) in times of smaller immigration and&#13;
thus a smaller labor force. From this perspective, a system with individual pension accounts&#13;
that link pension contributions and rights at the individual level appears to be more immune&#13;
to migration flow fluctuations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Another important consideration is that permanent migrants have greater incentives to&#13;
invest in country-specific human capital, whereas recent and temporary migrants are more&#13;
likely to work longer hours in jobs below their skill level. 138 Kahanec and Zimmermann&#13;
(2010a) report that EU-based labor market experts expect the share of temporary (and to a&#13;
lesser degree also circular) migrants to be higher among high-skilled than low-skilled&#13;
immigrants in the European Union. In view of these expectations, the integration of&#13;
temporary and circular migrants and the full utilization of their skills in host economies&#13;
appear to be of key importance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The nature and magnitude of the effects of migration thus depend on the scale and&#13;
composition of migration flows, the temporal nature of migration patterns (permanent,&#13;
temporary or circular), as well as the speed of the adjustment of migrants upon entry into&#13;
another labor market. Brain drain, gain and circulation may have very different&#13;
consequences for the human capital balance across sending and receiving countries. 139&#13;
From the above discussion, it also becomes clear that theoretical arguments do not warrant&#13;
any quick conclusions about the direction of these effects. We therefore look at the&#13;
empirical evidence on the effects of migration flows in the sending and receiving countries&#13;
in Europe. The 2004 and 2007 EU enlargements and the massive migration flows that&#13;

&amp;#12;ensued offer useful insights into the effects of increased labor mobility in receiving and&#13;
sending countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.b The receiving countries in the context of EU enlargement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 There is generally no evidence of statistically significant or economically relevant&#13;
 negative aggregate effects of post-enlargement migration on receiving labor&#13;
 markets or welfare systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Concerning the receiving countries, the available empirical evidence is rather on the&#13;
positive side. In particular, there is generally no evidence of negative effects of post-&#13;
enlargement migrants on nativesâ&#128;&#153; labor market outcomes. This also holds for the United&#13;
Kingdom, which received the largest absolute number of post-enlargement migrants, and&#13;
Ireland, which received the largest number of these migrants relative to its population. A&#13;
number of studies report no significant effects for the United Kingdom (Gilpin et al., 2006;&#13;
Blanchflower, Saleheen and Shadforth, 2007; Lemos and Portes, 2008), except perhaps&#13;
some small effect in the least skilled sectors (Blanchflower and Lawton, 2010). Some&#13;
indirect effects may have occurred through wage bargaining and moderation of wage&#13;
demands in anticipation of immigration (Blanchflower, Saleheen and Shadforth, 2007;&#13;
Blanchflower and Shadforth, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For Ireland, Doyle, Hughes and WadensjÃ¶ (2006) and Hughes (2007) report that a slow-&#13;
down of wage growth and some substitution of native workers possibly occurred in some&#13;
sectors, but the slow-down of wage growth was short-lived and the displaced workers&#13;
found jobs elsewhere; and so no effect on aggregate unemployment rate occurred. Barrett&#13;
(2010) corroborates these findings arguing that post-enlargement immigration helped to&#13;
preserve countryâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness to the extent it helped to moderate perhaps excessive&#13;
wage growth rates during the pre-2008 boom.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               95&#13;
&amp;#12;Although Sweden opened up its labor market to EU8 migrants immediately upon&#13;
enlargement in 2004, it only received moderate numbers of post-enlargement migrants.&#13;
The fear had been that these migrants would undermine Swedenâ&#128;&#153;s welfare system. A&#13;
number of studies argue, however, that no negative effects on labor market outcomes or&#13;
welfare occurred in Sweden either (Doyle, 2007; Hughes, 2007; Gerdes and WadensjÃ¶,&#13;
2010). 140&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Germany was among the countries that were most reluctant to open their labor market to&#13;
workers from new member states, opening up only as of May 1, 2011 â&#128;&#147; the last day by&#13;
which restrictive transitional arrangements had to be lifted. In spite of the restrictions,&#13;
Germany received considerable numbers of post-enlargement migrants. Brenke, Yuksel and&#13;
Zimmermann (2010) argue that migrants from EU8 member states compete with other&#13;
immigrants for low-skilled jobs rather than with natives. Kahanec, Zaiceva and Zimmermann&#13;
(2010) review this evidence to conclude that no significant negative effects have been&#13;
detected for the receiving countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
140&#13;
      Giulietti et al. (2013) reject the welfare magnet hypothesis for intra-EU migration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          96&#13;
&amp;#12;IV.c The sending countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  There is some evidence that post-enlargement out-migration has contributed to&#13;
  higher wages in the sending countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The outflow of young and skilled workers, however, poses risks to sending countriesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
  economic prospects and public finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Circular migration, brain gain, and remittances attenuate such risks, and may&#13;
  become powerful engines of convergence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Concerning the sending countries, the available evidence is still rather scarce. Yet, a number&#13;
of lessons can be drawn. The consequences of post-enlargement out-migration for the&#13;
sending countries appear to be more uncertain and perhaps more sensitive to the scale,&#13;
composition and temporal nature of migration flows. Kadziauskas (2007) points out that on&#13;
the background of negative demographic trends, the Lithuanian social security system may&#13;
be endangered by the massive outflow of skilled and relatively young workers following&#13;
Lithuaniaâ&#128;&#153;s EU accession. Indeed, he documents growing skill shortages in some sectors of&#13;
the Lithuanian economy. A similar trend in the post-accession period is reported by&#13;
Kaczmarczyk and OkÃ³lski (2008) and Kaczmarczyk et al. (2010) for Poland and KurekovÃ¡&#13;
(2011) for Slovakia. 141&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In view of these developments, a decisive question is to what extent the post-enlargement&#13;
migrant outflows are of permanent nature, indicative of brain drain, and to what extent&#13;
they represent an onset of circular migration patterns between new and old member states,&#13;
141&#13;
      A new phenomenon in these countries is that the emerging skill shortages are increasingly filled in by&#13;
immigration from non-EU countries, mainly Ukraine, Belarus, the Russian Federation and some Balkan states&#13;
(Iglicka, 2005; Frelak and KaÅºmierkiewicz, 2007; KurekovÃ¡, 2011).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         97&#13;
&amp;#12;possibly leading to brain gain. Most studies have so far indicated few signs of brain drain,&#13;
although some skill shortages due to significant outmigration surfaced in some sectors, such&#13;
as health care (BrÃ¼cker et al., 2002; Frelak and KaÅºmierkiewicz, 2007; European Commission,&#13;
2008; Hazans, 2012). In addition, post-enlargement migrants generally intend to stay in the&#13;
host country only for a limited period of time (Kahanec, Zaiceva and Zimmermann, 2010).&#13;
Although return migration is indeed present, net out-migration has been positive in every&#13;
year after enlargement. Moreover, Hazans (2012) reports adverse selection into return&#13;
migration to the Baltic states in terms of skill composition. While these return migrants may&#13;
still have acquired additional skills while abroad, such adverse selection and continued&#13;
outflows of relatively skilled and young labor force signify risks for the growth potential and&#13;
stability of social system in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A potentially important channel through which sending countries can benefit from out-&#13;
migration are remittances. Remittances were indeed quite significant especially in Bulgaria,&#13;
Romania and the Baltic states (Kahanec, Zaiceva and Zimmermann, 2010). Dietz (2009)&#13;
reports that in 2007 they constituted about 5 percent of Bulgariaâ&#128;&#153;s and Romaniaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP. The&#13;
worsened economic situation following the economic slump of the late 2000s was the likely&#13;
reason behind significantly lower volume of remittances to EU8 and EU2 in 2009 (Comini&#13;
and Faes-Cannito, 2010). Although remittances were initially used primarily for&#13;
consumption and purchase of durable goods, more recently they have been invested in&#13;
human capital as well, thus possibly partially compensating for the outflow of human capital&#13;
(Kaczmarczyk and OkÃ³lski, 2008). Elsner (2011) finds positive effects of outmigration on&#13;
wages of male workers in Lithuania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 98&#13;
&amp;#12;IV.d Simulations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Simulations indicate a positive effect of post-enlargement migration on aggregate&#13;
 per capita GDP of the European Union, of about â&#130;¬ 30,000 per migrant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The redistributive effects on wages and unemployment appear to be rather small and&#13;
 probably not very persistent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some efforts have been made to quantify the effects of post-enlargement migration flows&#13;
on key economic variables in the receiving and sending countries using simulations in&#13;
macroeconomic models. Baas, BrÃ¼cker and Hauptman (2010) arrive at rather small effects&#13;
on wages (-0.1 percent) and unemployment rate (+0.1 percent) in the EU15 in the short run&#13;
and no effects in the long run. For the sending countries, they predict an increase in wages&#13;
(+0.3 percent) and a decrease in unemployment rate (-0.4 percent) in the short run and,&#13;
again, no effects in the long run. In line with the argument that migration increases the&#13;
allocative efficiency of labor markets, the authors predict a 0.2 percent increase in the&#13;
aggregate GDP of an enlarged European Union, corresponding to a windfall of â&#130;¬ 24 billion in&#13;
total and â&#130;¬ 28,571 per post-enlargement migrant. Similar results are reported in the study&#13;
by Holland et al. (2011), although in their somewhat different model, the effects on real&#13;
wages are predicted to be of a more lasting nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.e Receiving and sending countries in other contexts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Although local and temporary redistributive effects cannot be ruled out, empirical&#13;
 evidence on the effects of migration on sending and receiving countries suggests that&#13;
 labor markets absorb immigrants rather seamlessly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              99&#13;
&amp;#12;Economically or statistically insignificant, and not necessarily negative, effects of immigrant&#13;
inflows on nativesâ&#128;&#153; and other immigrantsâ&#128;&#153; outcomes in receiving labor markets have also&#13;
been corroborated in contexts other than the recent EU enlargements. This includes studies&#13;
about immigration into the US labor market (Grossmann, 1982; Borjas, 1983; Borjas 1987),&#13;
Canada (Akbari and Devoretz, 1992; Roy, 1997), Australia (Addison and Worwick, 2002),&#13;
Germany (Winkelmann and Zimmermann, 1993; Pischke and Velling, 1997), France (Hunt,&#13;
1992), the United Kingdom (Dustmann, Fabbia and Preston, 2005) and Israel (Friedberg,&#13;
2001). Zorlu and Hartog (2005) find only negligible effects of immigration on nativesâ&#128;&#153; wages&#13;
in the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There are several studies reporting statistically significant negative effects of immigration&#13;
on nativesâ&#128;&#153; or other immigrantsâ&#128;&#153; wages or employment, including evidence on the United&#13;
States (Filer, 1992; Borjas, 1999b, 2003, 2006; Card, 2001; Chiswick and Miller, 2002 find&#13;
negative effects within linguistic groups), Portugal (Carrington and de Lima, 1996) and&#13;
Canada (Roy, 1987). The study of the Mariel boatlift as a natural experiment by Card (1990),&#13;
however, finds no negative effects on nativesâ&#128;&#153; or other immigrantsâ&#128;&#153; labor market outcomes.&#13;
Chapman and Cobb-Clark (1999) even report positive effects of immigration on nativesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
employment in Australia. De New and Zimmermann (1994) report some negative effects of&#13;
low-skilled immigration to Germany on the wages in the low-skilled sector and positive&#13;
effects in the high-skilled sector, in line with the model discussed above. Orrenius and&#13;
Zavodny (2007) report similar results for the United States, with negative effects&#13;
concentrated in the low-skilled sector; and Borjas, Freeman and Katz (1997) assign a part of&#13;
the increase in skill premium in the United States to immigration in the 1980s and 1990s.&#13;
Angrist and Kugler (2003) find that in the European context negative effects arise in&#13;
countries with more restrictive labor market institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              100&#13;
&amp;#12;Only scarce evidence is available about labor market effects in sending countries. 142 Mishra&#13;
(2007) and Aydemir and Borjas (2007) find positive long-run impacts on Mexico â&#128;&#147; assuming,&#13;
however, instantaneous exodus of migrants instead of the actual gradual out-migration.&#13;
Gagnon (2011), however, does find short-run positive effects of out-migration on stayersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
wages in Honduras.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.f Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While some displacement and reallocation has occurred as a consequence of post-&#13;
enlargement migration in the receiving countries, generally no statistically and economically&#13;
significant negative effects on wages, employment or the welfare system can be empirically&#13;
corroborated. Although in theory, skilled immigration reduces returns to education for&#13;
incumbent skilled workers, it may also expand the production potential of the receiving EU&#13;
member states by filling in skill bottlenecks. This may improve the allocative efficiency of&#13;
the internal EU labor market, the transfer of ideas and knowledge, or creation of trade&#13;
relationships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The sending countries may benefit from increased returns to human capital investment.&#13;
Concentration of complementary human capital in productivity hubs and positive spillover&#13;
effects from such hubs to sending countries add to the benefits of skilled migration. So do&#13;
positive effects of concentration of skilled (migrant) workers on the global competitiveness&#13;
of the European Union in the market for (foreign direct) investment and technological&#13;
transfer. Brain drain is the primary risk for the sending countries. Brain circulation and&#13;
circular migration are decisive for the nature of the effects especially in the sending&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
142&#13;
      Ample evidence exists about redistributive effects of remittances. See a review in Kahanec and&#13;
Zimmermann (2009).&#13;

&amp;#12;V. Conclusions and lessons for ASEAN regional integration&#13;
V.a Overall assessment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The EU single labor market is one of the most successful policy areas of EU integration and&#13;
enlargement. The free labor mobility within the European Union increases the allocative&#13;
efficiency of human capital and labor across EU labor markets. The expansion of the free&#13;
movement of workers to 12 new member states in the 2000s has indeed resulted in&#13;
significant additional migration flows in the European Union. This has increased overall&#13;
labor mobility in the European Union, but it still remains below what is observed in the&#13;
United States or even the Russian Federation. In spite of transitional arrangements the 2004&#13;
and 2007 enlargements have significantly increased geographic mobility in the European&#13;
Union. Given the slow-down of post-enlargement migration in the late 2000s and early&#13;
2010s, the increase was probably only temporary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In spite of low intra-EU mobility rates, some EU member states are host to significant&#13;
immigrant populations. Contrary to the overall perception, with the exception of&#13;
immigrants from ENP countries in the EU15, immigrants in the European Union attain&#13;
educational levels comparable to natives. However, with the exception of EU15 and EFTA&#13;
migrants, their occupational status tends to be lower than that of natives, signifying a&#13;
degree of downskilling. Downskilling may be a result of discrimination, language and&#13;
institutional barriers, but it also may be a part of migration trajectory preferred by some&#13;
migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
European migration is mainly driven by job- and family-related factors. Housing and local&#13;
environment concerns are also significant for future moves. Among the main barriers to&#13;
European mobility are transitional arrangements (which as of June 2012 still apply to&#13;
Bulgarian and Romanian workers), linguistic and cultural barriers, as well as anxiety about&#13;
finding a suitable job in the host country. EU10 migrants in the EU15 are on average&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             102&#13;
&amp;#12;positively selected vis-Ã -vis the source as well as host populations. In contrast, EU2 migrants&#13;
in the EU15 are less educated than the host as well as source populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The European Union has progressed in harmonizing legislation in order to facilitate internal&#13;
mobility. While there is some evidence that immigrants â&#128;&#156;grease the wheels of the labor&#13;
marketâ&#128;? by allocating to sectors with labor shortages more than natives, 143 there still&#13;
remain significant barriers to labor mobility in the European Union that may jeopardize such&#13;
positive effects of migration. These include transitional arrangements restricting migrants&#13;
from the EU2, administratively complex transfer and exercise of social-security and health-&#13;
insurance rights, complex cross-border taxation issues, practical difficulties with the&#13;
recognition of foreign qualifications and discrimination of migrants in access to business&#13;
services. Minimum wages and hiring and firing regulation interact with high-skilled&#13;
migration in a non-trivial manner. A less egalitarian (less progressive) taxation may attract&#13;
high-skilled migrants, who tend to be in higher income groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The ENP aims to promote mobility between the European Union and its Neighborhood&#13;
through improved labor markets access, investment possibilities, and intensified&#13;
professional, educational and cultural exchange. The degree to which this goal has been&#13;
achieved varies country by country. Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) have achieved&#13;
easier recognition of qualification but difficulties with implementation persist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Among ENP countries, Algeria, Morocco and Ukraine top the list of source countries with&#13;
the highest numbers of migrants in the European Union. As a share in host population,&#13;
Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Germany and Italy, as well as Slovenia and the Baltic&#13;
states, are host to the largest ENP populations. In spite of the high share of highly educated&#13;
workers among emigrants from some ENP countries, the overall share of high-skilled among&#13;
ENP migrants in the EU15 tends to be relatively low. This is because the European Union is&#13;
&#13;
143&#13;
      Borjas (2001).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              103&#13;
&amp;#12;losing skilled migrants to the United States and other destinations. Irregular migration may&#13;
negatively affect skilled immigration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Skilled labor migration from ENP countries to the European Union is driven by a number of&#13;
factors. These mainly include lagging economic development in the sending countries (low&#13;
wages, high unemployment and rising prices), a gap in opportunities for personal and&#13;
professional development after graduation between ENP countries and the European Union,&#13;
and a gap in access to quality social and health-care services and adequate social security&#13;
programs between ENP countries and the European Union. High fertility rates (primarily in&#13;
some of the countries south of the Mediterranean) cause migrants to seek employment&#13;
abroad in order to support large families. Educational opportunities and acquisition of&#13;
language skills in the host countries is an important pull factor for some migrants. On the&#13;
other hand, corruption, territorial conflicts, poor governance and state protection policy in&#13;
the sending countries are significant push factors. Bilateral agreements and facilitative&#13;
programs of individual member states create opportunities for skilled mobility from ENP&#13;
countries; however, the shortage of skilled labor in the European Union has not been filled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The main barriers to mobility from ENP countries to the European Union include restrictive&#13;
visa regimes and costly immigration procedures, difficult recognition of academic diplomas&#13;
and professional certificates, strict limitations on the possibility to stay in the host country&#13;
for migrants who lose their job and a lack of information about labor market opportunities.&#13;
Restrictive immigration management, including binding quotas, language barriers and&#13;
negative attitudes toward immigrants further hinder migration flows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The potential effects of immigration include effects on the distribution of earnings,&#13;
improved allocative efficiency in the labor market, improved flow of ideas, knowledge and&#13;
technology, goods and services, as well as capital, increased diversity of the labor force and&#13;
effects on public finance. The scale and skill composition of migration flows, their temporal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               104&#13;
&amp;#12;character, the speed of immigrantsâ&#128;&#153; adjustment in host labor markets and labor market&#13;
institutions determine the scale and nature of these effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is generally no evidence of significant and economically relevant negative effects of&#13;
post-enlargement migration on receiving labor markets or welfare systems. On the other&#13;
hand, there is some evidence that post-enlargement out-migration has contributed to&#13;
higher wages in the sending countries. The outflow of young and skilled workers, however,&#13;
poses risks to sending countriesâ&#128;&#153; welfare systems. These risks seem to persist in spite of the&#13;
potential of remittances and brain gain to compensate for the loss of labor force.&#13;
Simulations indicate a positive effect of post-enlargement migration on aggregate per&#13;
capita GDP of the European Union of about â&#130;¬ 30,000 per migrant. In general, the&#13;
redistributive effects on wages and unemployment appear to be rather small and probably&#13;
not very persistent. Hence, although local and temporary redistributive effects cannot be&#13;
ruled out, empirical evidence on the effects of migration on sending and receiving countries&#13;
suggests that labor markets absorb immigrants rather seamlessly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
V.b Lessons learned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The EU experience of skilled labor mobility offers a number of lessons. In view of the&#13;
demographic challenges Europe faces, well-qualified migrants are needed. Empirical&#13;
evidence shows that the hypothesis of negative wage or employment effects of migration in&#13;
receiving countries is a myth; and so seems to be also the hypothesis that migrants shop for&#13;
welfare. And yet, European migration discourse is generally ill-informed and results in a&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Fortress-Europeâ&#128;? approach to migration. Although some liberalization of immigration&#13;
occurred in the early 2000s, the crisis of the late 2000s and early 2010s has reversed many&#13;
of these efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Paradoxically, discontent with socio-economic integration of immigrants, Europeans are in a&#13;
vicious circle and seem to discourage migrants with higher, and attract those with lower,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             105&#13;
&amp;#12;probability to integrate. Misinterpreting the lack of immigrantsâ&#128;&#153; integration as something&#13;
inevitable for immigrants and ignoring the available evidence about the effects of&#13;
immigration, they form rather negative beliefs and attitudes regarding immigration. This&#13;
leads to political backlash against further immigration and implementation of restrictive&#13;
policy measures towards immigration. But it is precisely high-skilled immigrants that are&#13;
more sensitive to such negative attitudes and policy measures, and may choose other&#13;
destinations. It is not surprising then that Europe attracts fewer high-skilled immigrants&#13;
than its main competitors, such as the United States. Such negative selection then results in&#13;
substandard labor market outcomes of immigrants, which further fuels nativesâ&#128;&#153; negative&#13;
attitudes and completes the vicious circle. It should not also be forgotten that negative&#13;
attitudes is the quintessential barrier to immigrant integration, aggravating the situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This broad discrepancy between beliefs and evidence tells us that skillful management of&#13;
beliefs and attitudes regarding immigration is absolutely vital for any migration policy to&#13;
succeed. Given the sensitivity of the issue, the line between a vicious and virtuous circle&#13;
may be thin. Therefore, a careful and transparent framing of migration policy is similarly&#13;
important. This includes a policy-making process based on rigorous analysis and careful&#13;
interpretation of available evidence. It also involves transparency of the process with&#13;
respect to the stakeholders and the society as a whole. Discrimination and xenophobia need&#13;
to be specifically addressed.&#13;

From a practical perspective, harmonization of legislation, policies and institutions reduces&#13;
the costs of migration. Although the European Union has done much in this regard,&#13;
especially concerning free mobility in its internal market, many obstacles to mobility still&#13;
remain. These are often nitty-gritty â&#128;&#147; yet decisive â&#128;&#147; details, such as recognition of past&#13;
employment in another member state for unemployment benefit eligibility. Addressing&#13;
such obstacles requires a thorough review based on dialogue with stakeholders. Hidden&#13;
double taxation of spouses working in different member states and complex tax exemptions&#13;
should be avoided, as these are extremely difficult for migrants to manage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              106&#13;
&amp;#12;Downskilling of immigrants into jobs at a lower skill-level is a specific issue that requires&#13;
attention. Therefore, recognition of qualifications is of key importance for full utilization of&#13;
migrantsâ&#128;&#153; human capital. General harmonization efforts and MRAs help in this regard.&#13;
However, for migrants with often non-trivial migration trajectories, they often render the&#13;
administrative and legislative landscape overly complex. A difficulty is that even in case of&#13;
sufficient formal harmonization, its implementation suffers from inadequate administrative&#13;
resources. Any efforts to harmonize legislation, policies and institutions need to take good&#13;
consideration of the possibility of non-trivial migration trajectories of migrants and their&#13;
family members. Adequate administrative capacity to provide migrants with proficient&#13;
service of state institutions needs to be ensured as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As internationalization of higher education is an important channel of skilled migration,&#13;
harmonization of education is required. The Bologna Process has helped on the formal side,&#13;
but gaps remain in its implementation. A specific problem is that employers are not always&#13;
ready to quickly accept the new classification of degrees implemented within the Bologna&#13;
Process and confusion abounds. An important policy area is communication and providing&#13;
information to potential employers of migrants. For international students, the transition&#13;
from education to employment needs to be facilitated by granting them a sufficiently long&#13;
period after graduation to stay in the country and search for a job, with also access to&#13;
welfare and health services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The family perspective is clearly very important for international migration. This especially&#13;
concerns an adequate access of family members to social and health policies. In addition,&#13;
access to the labor market should also be provided also to tied family migrants. This is&#13;
especially important for skilled migrants, as they may be more sensitive to limited work&#13;
options for their spouses. To facilitate integration of permanent migrants a transparent and&#13;
predictable path towards citizenship should be provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               107&#13;
&amp;#12;Europe does recognize some of the challenges it faces in the domain of mobility&#13;
management, and has come up with a number of new approaches. One of which is the&#13;
European Blue Card, enabling the entry of skilled third-country nationals on relatively&#13;
favorable terms. The European Health Insurance Card has also been implemented,&#13;
facilitating health-care access to EU nationals in the whole of the European Union. The EU&#13;
Professional Card, which would facilitate the recognition of professional qualification in all&#13;
EU member states, is also being considered. Professional associations are also actively&#13;
trying to overcome the problems with the recognition of qualifications: for example, the&#13;
European Federation of National Engineering Associations uses the European EngineerING&#13;
Card, increasing the transparency and transferability of skills for engineers. While these&#13;
efforts are commendable, the key lesson from the EU experience of free mobility of workers&#13;
is that the creation of a single market must go hand in hand with the provision of labor&#13;
market institutions covering the whole single market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Europe is trying to achieve this by harmonizing national regulations and institutions.&#13;
However, a more fruitful approach would be creation of new institutions, including health&#13;
insurance, pension and social security schemes, operating at the EU level and unconstrained&#13;
by national borders. This is not a proposal for the creation of an unlikely â&#128;&#156;welfare unionâ&#128;?,&#13;
but rather a proposal for the liberalization of social, pension and health insurance for at&#13;
least some types of workers and migrants in particular.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From the discussion above, it has also become clear that transparency and the provision of&#13;
information are central to the success of migration policy. Migration inevitably involves&#13;
informational gaps on the side of migrants who enter new host countries. In fact, returning&#13;
migrants may also have difficulties re-adjusting to institutions in their country of origin.&#13;
Given the fractionalization of EU institutional space by national borders, with each member&#13;
state having its own (even if partly harmonized) regulation, it is desirable to provide&#13;
migrants with one-stop information and service shops facilitating their integration into their&#13;
new host country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              108&#13;
&amp;#12;Finally, increasing the transparency of migration and more evidence-based migration policy&#13;
making also involves evaluating implemented policies. This comprises data collection,&#13;
providing data to not only experts but also stakeholders and the general public, rigorous&#13;
independent policy evaluation, evidence-based policy design and implementation, as well&#13;
as monitoring the whole process.&#13;

&amp;#12;VII. Appendix&#13;
VII.a The European Neighborhood Policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 2004, the European Commission launched an initiative aimed at enhancing relations and&#13;
sound cooperation with the countries sharing land or sea borders with the European Union.&#13;
The initiative â&#128;&#147; European Neighborhood Policy â&#128;&#147; includes 16 countries that have had rather&#13;
different historical and business ties with the European Union as well as different political&#13;
systems and are at different stages of democratic reforms. Participants include countries of&#13;
Eastern Europe â&#128;&#147; Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine; South Caucasus â&#128;&#147; Armenia, Azerbaijan,&#13;
Georgia; and South Mediterranean â&#128;&#147; Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Lebanese Republic,&#13;
Libya, Morocco, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Syrian Arab Republic (self-&#13;
suspended on 22 June 2011) and Tunisia. The ENP is characterized by a common goal â&#128;&#147; to&#13;
enhance relations with EU neighbor countries by applying tailor-made cooperation schemes&#13;
to each neighbor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The ENP offers the same original instruments to all participating countries â&#128;&#147; to achieve&#13;
higher standards through Action Plans, progress monitoring and reporting (Country&#13;
Progress Reports and Proposals used as soft method of coordination) in terms of&#13;
democratization, human rights protection, economic development, good governance,&#13;
increased mobility and people-to-people contacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The ENP cooperation scheme involves individual Action Plans on the basis of which each&#13;
country should implement relevant reforms, while the European Union provides technical,&#13;
political and financial support. Twelve ENP countries have concluded Action Plans and are in&#13;
different stages of their implementation â&#128;&#147; Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco, the Occupied&#13;
Palestinian Territory, Tunisia and Ukraine have been working on internal reforms since 2005&#13;
and Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia and the Lebanese Republic since late 2006/early&#13;
2007. As of April 2012, four countries had not signed Action Plans with the European Union&#13;
â&#128;&#147; Algeria, Belarus, Libya and the Syrian Arab Republic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             123&#13;
&amp;#12;The institutional framework of the ENP requires the involvement of authorities from each of&#13;
the constituent parties. On behalf of the European Union, the European Commission is&#13;
responsible for preparing country reports that track the progress of each ENP state, while&#13;
the Council of Ministers comprising EU member state governments decides whether the&#13;
transition to the next stage of the Action Plan is possible. At the EU level, the ENP benefits&#13;
from the creation of a European External Action Service and is supervised by the High&#13;
Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the&#13;
European Commission (Catherine Ashton, as of April 2012) and a special Commissioner on&#13;
Enlargement and European Neighborhood Policy (Å tefan FÃ¼le, as of April 2012).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Apart from official national governmental bodies and EU institutions, actors responsible for&#13;
Action Plan implementation and evaluation include Subcommittees and local civic society&#13;
organizations participating in the discussion of recommended and implemented reforms.&#13;
Technical assistance programs offered by Eurostat to ENP-East countries include: advisory&#13;
assistance to national statistics offices, trainings, workshops and seminars as well as&#13;
collection, validation and dissemination of some data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The ENP should be reviewed alongside the related regional initiatives â&#128;&#147; Eastern Partnership&#13;
(launched in 2009 and includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and&#13;
Ukraine), Union for Mediterranean Partnership (re-launched as a continuation of the&#13;
Barcelona Process in 2008 and includes Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,&#13;
Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Lebanese Republic, Mauritania, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco,&#13;
the Palestinian Authority, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Turkey) and the Black Sea&#13;
Synergy (launched in 2008) complementing the policy and providing better regional focus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Eastern Partnership (EaP) was launched as an enhanced regional cooperation policy taking&#13;
into account the progress made in terms of ENP and maintaining its principles. Eastern&#13;
Partnership targets regional peculiarities and extends the areas of bilateral cooperation. EaP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              124&#13;
&amp;#12;and ENP are funded by the principal funding instrument â&#128;&#147; the European Neighborhood and&#13;
Partnership Instrument (ENPI). The instrument has been in operation since 2007 and is the&#13;
main source for funding ENP partners allowing additional allocations for EaP states. Within&#13;
this framework, Georgia and Moldova were the first to be included into special pilot&#13;
Mobility Partnerships, while Moldova and Ukraine have been implementing Visa Facilitation&#13;
Action Plans since 2010. The recent commencement of part of an Association Agreement&#13;
with the European Union in March 2012 signals technical progress in terms of bilateral&#13;
cooperation with Ukraine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Apart from ENPI, ENP partner countries can benefit from the following funding tools:&#13;
Governance Facility, Cross Border Cooperation, and Neighborhood Investment Facility.&#13;
Ninety percent of ENPI funds cover bilateral cooperation and 10 percent are allocated for&#13;
cooperation in terms of the above-mentioned tools supporting ENP through concrete&#13;
actions mainly aimed at improving institutional frameworks in the eastern and southern&#13;
neighbors of the European Union.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since 2004, the ten South-Mediterranean countries from the Euro-Mediterranean&#13;
Partnership (EU Initiative originally launched as the Barcelona Process in 1995) that are&#13;
included in the ENP can benefit from the ENPI funding scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Considering possible effects of the EU enlargement in 2007 with Bulgaria and Romania on&#13;
the cooperation in the Black Sea region, the Black Sea Synergy was launched to address&#13;
regional issues as a complementary initiative to the ENP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition, general EU policies such as the Global Approach to Migration (adopted in 2005)&#13;
and the instruments incorporated with it (Blue Card and Circular Migration Scheme)&#13;
contribute to an enhanced cooperation with ENP partners. The introduction of the Blue&#13;
Card program (Council Directive 2009/50/EC from 25 May 2009 on the conditions of entry&#13;
and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             125&#13;
&amp;#12;seems to be one of the few EU initiatives specifically targeting high-skilled workers from&#13;
third countries. According to the Directive, migrant workers who are Blue Card holders&#13;
should be treated equally with nationals as regards access to employment, pensions and&#13;
social security schemes. However, eligibility criteria â&#128;&#147; a 1.5 times higher salary than the&#13;
average in receiving member state as well as quotas to be set on the national levels may&#13;
hinder flows of skilled labor under the Blue Card scheme. There are no available statistics on&#13;
Blue Card holders because EU plans to start collecting the data from individual member&#13;
states only in 2013. Given its rather strict conditionality, it still projects a generally negative&#13;
attitude of Europeans towards immigration and there are some doubts about its ability to&#13;
attract high-skilled immigrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the Medium-term Program for a renewed ENP (2011-2014), support of sustainable&#13;
economic and social development is listed as one of the actions to be implemented across&#13;
the entire ENP geographical coverage. It includes enhanced dialogue on employment and&#13;
social policies starting from the second half of 2011. The program presupposes enhanced&#13;
dialogue with the participating countries promoting job creation although the program does&#13;
not elaborate in detail the necessary steps to be taken in this direction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Importantly, the program provides for visa regime facilitation and liberalization under the&#13;
paradigm that sound visa and migration policies are several of the pre-conditions for&#13;
successful professional exchanges and possible employment in the European Union for&#13;
nationals of ENP countries. ENP tries to promote enhanced mobility for business people,&#13;
students, artists, entrepreneurs through visa facilitation schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Assessing accomplished results after the launch of the policy, the Commission addressed&#13;
the migration issue in its Communications in 2006 and 2007 emphasizing the need to&#13;
facilitate the visa regime and remove obstacles for legitimate travel; both Communications&#13;
stressed the need to combat illegal migration and increase cooperation in terms of&#13;
readmission of illegal migrants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                126&#13;
&amp;#12;VII.b Bilateral mobility agreements between EU and ENP countries 144&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Austria regulates high-skilled migration by requiring expertise in demand, a specific salary&#13;
level and distinctive impact of employment activities. Generally the country applies various&#13;
measures of positive selection of skilled migrants, including fiscal incentives enabling some&#13;
categories of immigrants to apply up to 35 percent tax exemptions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Belgium concluded bilateral agreements with the following ENP states â&#128;&#147; Morocco (being&#13;
one of the main countries of origin for migrants to Belgium), Israel, Algeria and Tunisia&#13;
guaranteeing certain social benefits relating to pension and family allowances as well as&#13;
access to health care. A different type of bilateral agreement concerning occupation of&#13;
workers has been concluded with another group of countries, including Algeria, Morocco&#13;
and Tunisia. Furthermore, highly qualified or managerial workers, researchers, visiting&#13;
professors and specialized technicians under certain circumstances are exempt from market&#13;
test requirement in Belgium, meaning that they can be employed without prior verification&#13;
if a Belgium national can fill in the position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bulgaria offers easier access to labor market for high-skilled workers such as scholars,&#13;
intellectuals and high level managers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Moldovans, Lebanese, Syrians, Jordanese and Egyptians are the largest immigrant groups in&#13;
Cyprus, most of them employed in the service sector or agriculture. Migrants from Jordan&#13;
and the Lebanese Republic constitute an exception in Cyprus as many of them are high-&#13;
skilled employees (Trimikliniotis, 2003). Cyprus developed a rather favorable law relating to&#13;
employment of foreigners guaranteeing equal treatment concerning social insurance. In&#13;
addition, bilateral agreements expanding benefit schemes for citizens of particular countries&#13;
&#13;
144&#13;
      Based on IOM (2009); Bonin et al. (2008); European Migration Network (2007a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      127&#13;
&amp;#12;have been concluded with a number of countries, Egypt being the only country representing&#13;
ENP states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Czech Republic has been recently receiving relatively large inflows of migrants from&#13;
Eastern Europe. In the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, and before the EU&#13;
enlargement in 2004, the number of migrants from Eastern Europe had been rising, as these&#13;
migrants did not require visas to travel to Czech Republic. As a result, the 2000s have&#13;
witnessed sizeable communities of second generation immigrants from Ukraine. For&#13;
instance, according to 2006 data there were 200,000 Ukrainians in the Czech Republic&#13;
(around 2 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s population) and independent experts claim that that the&#13;
number would be substantially higher if illegal migrants were included. 145 The Czech&#13;
Republic is one of the few member states that has developed legislation targeting highly&#13;
skilled workers. The Pilot Project Selection on Qualified Workers was launched in 2003,&#13;
substantially easing procedures of acquiring residence status in the country after only two&#13;
and a half years of legal employment. Among ENP countries, Belarus and Ukraine could&#13;
benefit from the project. The definition of a highly qualified worker is a rather peculiar one,&#13;
as the main criteria are citizenship, complete secondary education and knowledge of&#13;
languages. The scheme presupposes social security and pension payments. At the same&#13;
time, according to recent surveys, the visa policy of the Czech Republic is not favorable for&#13;
labor migrants, as visa authorities impose strict rules and complicated procedures requiring&#13;
a set of documents that highly skilled professionals are not able to provide in many cases. 146&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Denmark is another country that due to labor shortages implements special programs&#13;
targeting professionals. In 2002, the Job Card Scheme was introduced, facilitating residence&#13;
and work permit procedures. Danish labor policy encourages labor migration from&#13;
especially Eastern Europe. In 2005, for example, 4,932 residence permits were granted to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
145&#13;
      ICPS/IPA (2006).&#13;
146&#13;
      Europe without Barriers (2010).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              128&#13;
&amp;#12;applicants from these countries and within a year this number had doubled, although only&#13;
902 of them were issued under the Job Card Scheme. 147 Apart from high-skilled workers&#13;
(defined mainly by the level of education), the scheme targets researchers, teachers,&#13;
athletes, religious workers, leading executives and specialists. A three-year grace period to&#13;
seek employment as well as eased taxation for certain categories of employees constituted&#13;
additional advantages for high-skilled migrants securing their stay in Denmark.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Baltic states â&#128;&#147; and Estonia in particularâ&#128;&#147; concluded bilateral agreements facilitating visa&#13;
and employment procedures for former Soviet states. Estonia signed an agreement on&#13;
social security issues with Ukraine â&#128;&#147; however, it does not relate to pension payments, but&#13;
rather focuses on other benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The government of Finland tries to attract highly skilled employees under the Government&#13;
Migration Policy introduced in 2006 in order to employ foreign experts. It is important to&#13;
mention that Finland permits foreign workers who for any reasons had left the country to&#13;
return. This issue is of high importance for labor migrants from ENP countries, as after they&#13;
lose employment, they often turn into illegal migrants or are driven to return home because&#13;
they are not granted reasonable time and opportunities to seek new employment.&#13;
Immigrant groups receiving special treatment in Finland are similar to those in Belgium â&#128;&#147;&#13;
athletes, religious workers, managers or executives, researchers; however, professional&#13;
trainers, non-profit or culture and art experts, and professionals in mass communication are&#13;
also included. Finland uses also the following instruments to promote skilled labor mobility:&#13;
tax exemptions for certain categories of high-skilled workers; and a six-month period for&#13;
foreign students to look for employment after they finish studies in Finland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
France historically provided more favorable conditions for migrants from Algeria, Morocco&#13;
and Tunisia (all southern ENP). Among recent instruments, we should note the talent card&#13;
&#13;
147&#13;
      IOM (2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             129&#13;
&amp;#12;approach targeting foreigners who promote economic development in the sending country&#13;
and France. France places emphasis on both educational level and professional experience&#13;
when promoting foreign high-skilled employment through eased tax regulations and access&#13;
to social security and health-care benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Realizing shortages of high-skilled labor and receiving large numbers of low-skilled migrants&#13;
over the last decades, Germany has been trying to attract foreign professionals through&#13;
exchange education programs and later possibilities of employment for foreign students as&#13;
well as labor migration programs. The latest one was approved in 2009. Germany targets&#13;
the following sectors â&#128;&#147; scientists, teachers, researchers, senior executives and IT specialists.&#13;
IT specialists were specifically targeted with the German Green Card scheme during 2000-&#13;
2004. The scheme emphasized education level, employment offer and level of salary&#13;
necessary to be considered for a residence permit on the basis of a 10,000 IT expert quota.&#13;
More generally, a new policy was adopted in 2009 that enabled non-EU immigrants with&#13;
university degrees, as well as their family members, to seek employment in Germany if&#13;
offered a job. Consent of the Federal Employment Agency is not required if they are&#13;
independent from the public social system and integrated into the German society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Greece has developed an elaborate system of promoting high-skilled employment of foreign&#13;
nationals targeting scientists, researchers, university professors, artists, company&#13;
managerial staff, as well as archeologists, entrepreneurs, researchers and academics.&#13;
According to official statistics for 2000-2001, numerous high-skilled workers from Armenia,&#13;
Egypt and the Syrian Arab Republic were employed as legislators, senior officials or&#13;
managers (with the exception of Syrians), professionals, technical and associate&#13;
professionals, and skilled agricultural workers and fishermen; however, the largest numbers&#13;
of skilled migrants were working in craft and related fields and as plant and machine&#13;
operators. In most professions, significant gender unbalance was noticed.148 Although&#13;
&#13;
148&#13;
      Kanellopoulos and Cholezas (2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               130&#13;
&amp;#12;evidence is not yet fully available, it is most likely that the economic crisis that struck&#13;
Greece in the late 2000s and early 2010s has pushed many ENP migrants back home or to&#13;
other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Even though data from Hungary shows a worrying proportion of foreign and native-born&#13;
workers in terms of education level (immigrants in general are better educated than&#13;
nationals), there is no state program in Hungary targeting high-skilled immigration.&#13;
Employment opportunities for immigrants in Hungary are fairly limited due to the difficult&#13;
economic situation, and companies prefer migrants who do not require a work permit,&#13;
generally from the other EU member states. Thus, access to employment is rather limited&#13;
for ENP migrants, even though Ukraine is the country sending the highest number of&#13;
migrants to Hungary (mostly for family reunification). Hungary also applies a market test&#13;
before recruiting foreign workers, meaning that there is a compulsory one-month waiting&#13;
period to confirm that no Hungarian national can fill the position. The market test is not&#13;
applied when recruiting workers for international companies, athletes or similarly specific&#13;
categories. However, certain high-skilled workers do not need a work permit to stay in&#13;
Hungary â&#128;&#147; diplomats, representatives of international organizations, researchers and&#13;
certain categories of students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ireland applies liberal migration policy by means of a facilitative green card program for&#13;
skilled workers, especially in such sectors as information technology, health care, science&#13;
and engineering, construction and financial services. The green card program stipulates a&#13;
minimum gross annual salary for participants, with a lower threshold applied for those in&#13;
the abovementioned sectors. Immigrants who do not qualify for the green card program&#13;
may still obtain a residence and work permit under more restrictive conditions, and if they&#13;
are adequately qualified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Most migrants in Italy are low- to medium-skilled workers, with a notable exception of&#13;
Ukrainian labor communities involving mostly middle-aged women working in the private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               131&#13;
&amp;#12;care system. The shortage of nurses is so critical that nurses have been able to enter the&#13;
country under a quota exemption since 2002; as of 2004 and out of ENP countries, doctors&#13;
from Israel and Jordan, the Lebanese Republic and the Syrian Arab Republic make up 10&#13;
percent of the foreign doctors registered in Italy; by 2006 Belarus, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, the&#13;
Lebanese Republic, Morocco, Moldova, the Syrian Arab Republic and Ukraine sent 3, 18, 63,&#13;
65, 135, 3, 20, 59 and 16 doctors, respectively, who were included into the Italian Medical&#13;
Association. Over 2002-2005, the number of nurses working in Italy almost doubled â&#128;&#147; from&#13;
1,821 to 2,616. However, the overall data on qualification recognition is not impressive&#13;
across ENP countries â&#128;&#147; qualifications of only five nurses from Algeria, two from Belarus, one&#13;
from Egypt, one from Georgia, three from Morocco and thirty from Ukraine were&#13;
recognized as of 2005.149 According to official data there are about 200,000 Ukrainian&#13;
migrants in Italy. However, independent studies claim that there are at least three times as&#13;
many. 150 Italy sets quota system by country according to the sectors of labor shortage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Latvia makes a notable exception targeting IT in an annual quota set at 100, which is a&#13;
relatively small number. Among ENP countries, migrants mainly from Belarus and Ukraine&#13;
work in Latvia, primarily in low-skilled sectors, though a number of IT specialist from&#13;
Ukraine are employed under Latviaâ&#128;&#153;s quota scheme. In 2007, the Latvian government&#13;
endeavored to decrease the cost of employing and simplified recruiting procedures for&#13;
immigrant workers. Although this proposal was criticized by the Latvian Employers&#13;
Confederation as promoting illegal employment rather than attracting foreign professionals.&#13;
As a result, the proposal was not enacted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Similarly to Latvia, the government of Lithuania began to acknowledge the need for more&#13;
favorable conditions for third-country workers. The Law on the Legal Status of Aliens,&#13;
approved in 2004, resulted in an easier access of foreign nationals to the Latvian labor&#13;

&amp;#12;market. As a consequence, the numbers of migrants increased mainly in industrial,&#13;
transport, service and construction sectors. ENP migrants work mostly as cooks (a high&#13;
number of Armenians), in oil refineries, as international transportation drivers, in&#13;
construction, ship construction and aviation. In addition, since migrants from Belarus and&#13;
Ukraine can benefit from bilateral agreement on social security and temporary employment,&#13;
Ukraine and Belarus have sent the largest number of migrants to Lithuania (31 percent and&#13;
29 percent). 151&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Despite being a country with a rather restrictive employment migration policy, Malta&#13;
nevertheless concluded bilateral agreement with Libya on social security; and has received&#13;
some inflows of migrants from ENP countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Netherlands conducts a positively selective policy towards high-skilled employment by&#13;
means of exemption from the labor market test and eased taxation. The Netherlands&#13;
applies a rather innovative scheme of programs for the so-called â&#128;&#156;knowledge migrantsâ&#128;?. The&#13;
salary criterion was applied in defining the knowledge migrant which gives employers the&#13;
right to define the skill level of foreign migrants. The level of education is not considered to&#13;
be a defining factor for highly skilled labor. Under the Dutch scheme, admission policy and&#13;
taxation has been relaxed for foreign migrants working as legislators, senior legislators,&#13;
senior officials and managers, professionals, technicians and associate professionals.&#13;
Researchers and physicians are included in the notion of â&#128;&#156;knowledge migrantsâ&#128;?, although&#13;
they do not have to meet the salary requirements. As the knowledge migrant scheme does&#13;
not set any quota and is not tied to any specific countries, no bilateral agreements have&#13;
been signed with non-EU Member states. At the same time, Dutch authorities have set out&#13;
several eligibility requirements for simplified taxation â&#128;&#147; they must possess expertise not&#13;
available to Dutch citizens, relevant level of education and professional experience. The&#13;
Netherlands also aims to attract foreign students by permitting them to stay in the country&#13;
&#13;
151&#13;
      IOM (2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                              133&#13;
&amp;#12;and look for a job for three months after completing their studies. Other instruments&#13;
promoting self-employment and employment of talented individuals engaged in sectors&#13;
such as culture and research are also applied. According to the Immigration and&#13;
Naturalization Service of the Netherlands, none of the ENP countries in 2007 were included&#13;
into the top immigrant countries under the knowledge migrant scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Among ENP countries, Ukraine is the main country of origin of migrants to Poland, followed&#13;
by Belarus and Armenia. Pressed by high numbers of illegal migrants, the Polish government&#13;
applies a facilitated employment system for Eastern European workers, issuing a six month&#13;
residence permit if the worker is employed for the first time. Ukrainian holders of the&#13;
special â&#128;&#156;Polish Cardâ&#128;? (issued on the basis of documented Polish descent) can work in Poland&#13;
without any restrictions. Furthermore, bilateral agreements on social benefits have been&#13;
signed with Libya.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ukrainians make up 14.7 percent of immigrants in Portugal, which is a rather high share if&#13;
we take into account that migrants from Brazil â&#128;&#147; traditional country of migrantsâ&#128;&#153; origin for&#13;
Portugal â&#128;&#147; make up 14.9 percent, followed by Moldovans, with a 3 percent share. They are&#13;
mostly employed in the construction sector. Portuguese legislation includes provisions&#13;
promoting employment of scientists and highly skilled workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Due to historic and cultural developments, Romania receives the largest number of&#13;
migrants from Moldova, consequently creating facilitated conditions for their employment.&#13;
Bilateral agreements have also been signed with the Syrian Arab Republic and Ukraine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As is also the case with other new EU member states, Slovakia has experienced a rise of&#13;
immigrants following EU accession in 2004. Migrants come mostly from neighboring Eastern&#13;
European countries, including Ukraine. Slovakia also applies a quota system for labor&#13;
migrants on the basis of bilateral agreements. Similarly to Ireland, the government of&#13;
Slovakia advertizes available job offers on a specially created website.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             134&#13;
&amp;#12;Spain applies a special work permit program that facilitates entry of migrants who have an&#13;
offer from an employer in Spain. Migrants not staying in Spain can apply, and it is up to the&#13;
consulate to make sure that the market test is passed (the job is â&#128;&#156;hard to fillâ&#128;? with Spanish&#13;
nationals) before the visa is issued to the worker. Spain focuses on cooperation with some&#13;
sending countries in terms of managing labor migration. On the basis of a bilateral&#13;
agreement with Morocco, labor migrants from Morocco can make use of job offer&#13;
notifications, facilitated selection procedures and work contracts, as well as work permits.&#13;
In addition, the Spanish approach includes raising awareness concerning social benefits and&#13;
rights of foreign migrants, particularly in terms of social security, pension payments and&#13;
taxation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 2007, Sweden announced a governmental plan to improve labor possibilities for foreign&#13;
workers, abandoning the market test rule. Migrants in Sweden can rely on pension&#13;
payments after retirement. High-skilled workers representing teachers, researchers,&#13;
performers, technicians and representatives from multinational companies can enjoy the&#13;
benefit of work permit exemption. Students are given some time to look for a job in Sweden.&#13;
High-skilled workers might also fall under special tax regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Historically, the United Kingdom has been one of the top countries attracting migrants from&#13;
different continents. Realizing the need to upgrade its migration policy and fill in labor&#13;
shortages, the points-based tier program for highly skilled migrants was launched in 2002,&#13;
leading to an increase in the number of work permits issued. In contrast to this, the United&#13;
Kingdom has been restrictive in admitting migrants under the tier scheme for qualified&#13;
professionals since 2010. Apart from the five-tier system for migrants, there are other&#13;
schemes promoting employment of foreign nationals â&#128;&#147; Sector-Based or Fresh Talent&#13;
Working in Scotland. Tier one and tier two target highly skilled immigrants, such as&#13;
entrepreneurs, investors and graduate students. By 2010, a number of doctors, engineers,&#13;

&#13;

                                              135&#13;
&amp;#12;scientists possessing qualifications and an appropriate education level as well as necessary&#13;
knowledge of English could benefit from the system.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
This study evaluates European Union (EU) experience of the mobility of skilled labor migrants&#13;
after the 2004 and 2007 EU enlargements and from the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP)&#13;
countries. The study concludes that migration generally improves the allocative efficiency of&#13;
labor markets and there is little if any evidence of statistically significant or economically&#13;
relevant negative aggregate effects of migration on receiving labor markets. While outflow of&#13;
young and skilled workers may pose risks to sending countriesâ&#128;&#153; economic prospects and public&#13;
finance, circular migration, brain gain, and remittances attenuate such risks, and have the&#13;
potential to become powerful engines of convergence. Obstructive legislation and ill-designed&#13;
migration policies impede migration and deprive sending and receiving countries of such&#13;
potential benefits.&#13;
