THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT&#13;
EDUCATION ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
1.   BACKGROUND AND SECTOR ASSESSMENT&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government's major priorities for education, as identified in Mubarak's&#13;
National Project (October 1995), are: (a) to ensure universal access to basic education,&#13;
with an emphasis on girls; and (b) to significantly upgrade the quality of education at all&#13;
levels so that students can obtain the skills needed to compete in the global economy.&#13;
Reform of compulsory education, including sector management at the central level and&#13;
involvement of local levels in planning and implementation of initiatives to change the&#13;
process of schooling, is the Government's most urgent priority in education. Changes in&#13;
compulsory education represent the first phase of the Government's plans for&#13;
comprehensive reform of the education system.&#13;
1.2   A window of opportunity is now open for Egypt to achieve greater integration&#13;
into the world economy and thus to reap many of the benefits of world trade. The&#13;
proposed European Union-Egypt free trade agreement will enhance this opportunity,&#13;
thus making it all the more important for Egypt to improve its competitiveness vis-a-vis&#13;
the EU's other trading partners. In support of this goal and of private-sector growth, the&#13;
Government has made developing the country's human resources a top national priority.&#13;
B. SECTOR BACKGROUND &amp; ISSUES&#13;
Access - Supply &amp; Demand Factors&#13;
1.3   Through the first half of the 1990s the primary and preparatory education system&#13;
expanded by over 170,000 students, or nine percent, per year. Mainly through an&#13;
aggressive investment program, the Government has made impressive achievements in&#13;
providing school places. By the 1995 school year, the boys gross enrollment rate in&#13;
primary education (including students in the Al-Azhar religious system) had reached 107&#13;
percent, with the girls rate at 99 percent. Gross enrollment includes primary students&#13;
beyond primary school age: six percent of boys and five percent of girls enrolled in the&#13;
primary stage are of preparatory school age. Net enrollment in preparatory education is&#13;
significantly lower for both groups: 73 percent of boys and 64 percent of girls are&#13;
enrolled'. Gender disparity is most pronounced at the preparatory stage, where gross&#13;
enrollment was 99 and 81 percent, respectively, for boys and girls, and at all levels of&#13;
Net enrollment is the ratio of students ages 6-11 for primary and 12-14 for preparatory over the&#13;
same population cohort.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                         Egypt: Education Enhancement Program&#13;
basic education in poor rural areas. In Assyuit, Beni-Suef and Minya girls account for&#13;
under 40 percent of both primary and preparatory students (see Annex 1).&#13;
1.4   The Government is attempting to meet the objectives of providing universal&#13;
access to, and eliminating all multiple shift schools in, basic education through a capital&#13;
construction program intended to provide different types of school buildings in different&#13;
areas, depending on local need. The construction program tripled education's share of&#13;
Government investment, from six percent in 1991 to eighteen percent in 1996.&#13;
Evaluation of USAID-funded school construction in the 1980s showed that enrollment&#13;
grew faster, as compared to a control group, in areas where construction was carried out.2&#13;
1.5   However, the construction program has failed thus far to take into account the&#13;
obstacles to parental demand for girls education in culturally conservative areas. Studies&#13;
show that various factors impede girls education in Egypt. Lack of schools within safe&#13;
walking distance was cited as a prime determinant. Other factors include corporal&#13;
punishment by teachers, the presence of male teachers and the absence of sanitary&#13;
facilities. In addition, girls' responsibility to help with domestic chores, the possibility of&#13;
paid labor, the low educational level of parents, fathers' desire to marry daughters off at&#13;
an early age, and large families where boys take precedence in receiving an education all&#13;
depress girls' access to education.&#13;
Quality - Instruction &amp; Learning&#13;
1.6   While effort and accomplishment in providing access to education have been&#13;
substantial, the quality of teaching and of learning outcomes throughout the system is&#13;
low. A 1994 UNICEF survey suggests that there has been a decline in the acquisition of&#13;
basic literacy skills since the late 1980s, and that attainment of mathematical skills is&#13;
worse. In academic year 1995/96, 5 percent of girls and 8 percent of boys were repeaters&#13;
(see Annex 1); these rates however increase at the final grade of the primary stage to 9&#13;
and 13 percent respectively. The increase in repetition rates in the final year of primary is&#13;
an indication that many students face substantial difficulties in qualifying for transition to&#13;
the preparatory level. Repetition rates increase further in the first year of the preparatory&#13;
level, to 12 percent for girls and 14 percent for boys. This indicates that among students&#13;
who do qualify for the transition to the preparatory level, many are not prepared for the&#13;
material in the first year. Repetition for the preparatory stage as a whole was 10 percent&#13;
for girls and 12 percent for boys, with proportions similar to these in the final year. High&#13;
repetition rates in basic education contribute to both low completion rates and&#13;
overcrowded classrooms.&#13;
1.7   High repeater rates and low achievement are due to three principal causes: poor&#13;
learning conditions in overcrowded classrooms, inadequate teaching skills, and a lack of&#13;
focus throughout the system on student learning. Two thirds of basic education schools&#13;
operate double or triple shifts. Students lose five hours a week of instructional time in&#13;

Program; Robinson, Makary and Rugh for Creative Associates International; 1987&#13;

Egypt: Education Enhancement Program                                           3&#13;
multiple shift schools, for a total of 170 fewer hours a year in core subjects than students&#13;
in full day sessions. They also lose classes and activities in art, music, speech and current&#13;
events.&#13;
1.8    Regardless of single or multiple shifts, schools generally suffer from low quality&#13;
teaching. This is in part due to low teacher quality and motivation. In 1994/95 only 7&#13;
percent of primary teachers had a university degree in education, although 80 percent had&#13;
a secondary or post-secondary education degree. At the preparatory stage, 72 percent of&#13;
all teachers had an education degree, including 63 percent at the university level. The&#13;
pre-service teacher training curriculum at the post-secondary level emphasizes theory&#13;
rather than practice, and includes little subject-specific training. Although the curriculum&#13;
focuses on pedagogy, it does not emphasize interactive learning. This reinforces the&#13;
focus of basic education teaching on rote memorization of textbook materials regardless&#13;
of students' comprehension of the content.&#13;
1.9   Financial support for in-service training by the central Ministry is low, and&#13;
resources at the Governorate level for this purpose are virtually unavailable. The entire&#13;
in-service training materials budget in Giza Governorate for the 1995/96 school year was&#13;
less than US$1,000. In addition, trainers are themselves untrained and are selected on&#13;
the basis of seniority rather than qualifications and competence. They are responsible for&#13;
both evaluation and advice to teachers, creating a conflict of interest which results in&#13;
teachers preferring to avoid trainers rather than make use of them.&#13;
1.10  Formal teacher salaries are low, with base pay rates of about LE 80 to 400 a&#13;
month depending on seniority. The upper end of this range is less than half of what is&#13;
required to support an average family. Nearly all teachers hold second jobs, many in&#13;
private tutoring. The market for private tutoring is reportedly huge: an estimated LE 7&#13;
billion per year is spent by Egyptian households, roughly equal to total public education&#13;
expenditures, and good teachers can earn ten times their government salary in tutoring&#13;
fees. This presents teachers with an important incentive to place more effort on private&#13;
lessons than on their classroom duties. Sixty-three percent of preparatory students&#13;
surveyed by the MOE stated that they take private lessons to supplement classroom&#13;
teaching. Tutoring costs per child amount to approximately 6 percent of average&#13;
household expenditure. However, while tutoring increases the chance of completing&#13;
primary education, it does not significantly improve the acquisition of basic literacy&#13;
skills.&#13;
1.11  Given budgetary constraints and civil service regulations, the scope for increasing&#13;
teacher salaries is limited. Even if it were possible to increase teacher salaries by 50&#13;
percent, it is unlikely that this would cause teaching quality to increase or private tutoring&#13;
to decline (See Annex 2).&#13;
System Efficiency &amp; Focus&#13;
1.12  Resource use efficiency is poor in all aspects of the sector: (a) school designs&#13;
have costs 5 to 20 percent over efficient construction and space utilization standards; (b)&#13;
approximately two teachers are employed per class, but classes are taught by one teacher;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                     Egypt: Education Enhancement Program&#13;
(c) the non-teaching staff ratio is high (0.85:1, as compared to 0.58:1 in OECD&#13;
countries); and (d) teacher contact hours are short.&#13;
1.13  The system's focus on the enforcement of rules and regulations, rather than on&#13;
improving student learning, represents a significant factor impeding acquisition of basic&#13;
skills. Teachers do not organize their work according to their students' learning needs but&#13;
rather in accordance with national directives on curriculum and lesson planning. This&#13;
reinforces mechanistic teaching and rote learning. Local administrators follow directives&#13;
from above and have little scope for initiative in response to identified local needs. The&#13;
MOE is a highly compartmentalized bureaucracy with offices in each Governorate which&#13;
mirror the organizational arrangements of the center and a number of semi-autonomous&#13;
national agencies (e.g. the General Authority for Educational Buildings (GAEB), the&#13;
Center for Curriculum and Instructional Materials Development (CCIMD) and the&#13;
National Center for Educational Examinations and Evaluations (NCEEE)). The central&#13;
Ministry offices have difficulty in coordinating the work of these various bodies. While&#13;
a number of agencies outside the central Ministry function well, they are often neither&#13;
integrated into its activities nor with each other, impeding their effectiveness in&#13;
undertaking initiatives to improve educational processes. It is therefore necessary to shift&#13;
the system's focus towards student learning, and away from bureaucratic processes and&#13;
strict conformity with guidelines.&#13;
C. LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH IDA AND OTHER DONORS' INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1. 14 Egypt has benefited from significant financial and technical support for the&#13;
education sector from several donors, in particular from USAID through the Basic&#13;
Education Program (1981-1994). This program was successful in constructing and&#13;
equipping schools and providing instructional materials. However, the Government&#13;
failed to maintain the schools, a problem corrected in 1993 with a substantial increase in&#13;
the maintenance budget and implementation of an ambitious maintenance program&#13;
(Annex 3). The project also supported institutional and staff development of the CCIMD&#13;
as well as the development of an Educational Management Information System (EMIS).&#13;
The EMIS has been infrequently used for planning and decision making, contrary to&#13;
original plans. The project showed that establishing or supporting semi-autonomous&#13;
agencies without ensuring substantial integration with MOE activities is likely to lead to&#13;
marginalization and limited effectiveness of agencies in carrying out their intended&#13;
purposes.&#13;
1.15 In 1992, UNICEF helped to establish a few multi-grade community schools in&#13;
rural Egypt, particularly in Assiut, Sohag and Qena. The community schools were&#13;
limited in number with the objective of reaching only about 100 schools in 1996. These&#13;
schools were effective in reaching unserved rural girls and boys, but the positive lessons&#13;
learned have not been transferred to the Government system. The German KfW is&#13;
involved in a project to construct primary schools in rural areas with a goal of increasing&#13;
girls enrollment. The key lesson learned from various donors' involvement is the&#13;
difficulty of spreading positive innovations throughout the regular system without fully&#13;
integrating activities with the public system from the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Education Enhancement Program                                       5&#13;
1.16  In the 1970s, three IDA projects focused on training skilled workers for the&#13;
industrial and construction sectors, teacher training and upgrading university staff.&#13;
Subsequent IBRD loans (approved in 1983 and 1985) provided vocational training for&#13;
the industrial, construction and electricity sectors. Both projects received "satisfactory"&#13;
OED ratings. An ongoing Engineering and Technical Education Project (Ln.3137) is&#13;
upgrading university programs and technical teacher education.  IDA involvement&#13;
recommenced in 1993 with approval of the Basic Education Improvement Project&#13;
(Cr.2476), the objectives of which were to expand access and improve both in-service&#13;
training and the EMIS. The project is also funded by UJNDP grants (US$700,000) for&#13;
preliminary implementation activities. Both ongoing projects (Ln.3137 and Cr.2476)&#13;
initially implemented slowly. Implementation has since accelerated considerably and&#13;
both have "satisfactory" Development Objective ratings in the latest supervision reports.&#13;
Delays were due mainly to parliamentary ratification, as well as compliance with IDA&#13;
procurement and disbursement rules for civil works and equipment. Lessons of&#13;
experience from these projects indicate that counterpart staff training in IDA&#13;
procurement guidelines and procedures, or harmonization of IDA and Govemment&#13;
procedures is necessary, as well as adequate funding for start-up activities critical to&#13;
project effectiveness.  IDA has reviewed the Government's present procurement&#13;
procedures and found them to be consistent with its requirements.&#13;
2.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1   The objectives of the proposed project are to enhance the Ministry's ability to&#13;
achieve its major long-term goals with respect to improving: (a) coverage, particularly&#13;
for girls; (b) the quality of student learning; and (c) the efficiency of the education&#13;
system. The project supports a five-year time slice (1997-2001) of the Government's&#13;
long-term reform program for compulsory education. A series of operations over 10 to&#13;
15 years is envisioned to pursue the goals of the Education Enhancement Program (EEP).&#13;
2.2   Outcome Indicators. Achievement of the project objectives would be measured&#13;
by the following five-year outcome indicators (paragraph 3.14 and Annex 4): (a)&#13;
Placement of new schools, based on school mapping and community surveys, has&#13;
enabled both increased enrollment and decreased overcrowding; (b) Girls' enrollment has&#13;
increased significantly in Governorates in which girls are currently underserved; (c) In&#13;
Governorates participating in the project in years 1 and 2, childrens' basic skills have&#13;
increased; (d) In Governorates participating in the project in years 1 and 2, childrens'&#13;
critical thinking skills have increased; (e) Policy decisions relating to access and equity,&#13;
improvement of quality, and system efficiency, at the national and Governorate levels in&#13;
participating Governorates, are based on data, analysis, and objective criteria, and (f)&#13;
Decisions relating to access and equity, improvement of quality, and system efficiency,&#13;
have been effectively implemented in a coordinated manner (both horizontally and&#13;
vertically) at both the national and Governorate levels.&#13;

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.3   The Ministry of Education together with IDA as Administrator of the Interim&#13;
Trust Fund and the EU have agreed that a broad and long-term program approach, as&#13;
opposed to a narrowly defined project with rigidly specified activities, is the most&#13;
appropriate instrument to achieve the Government's goals in compulsory education&#13;
because it will afford the flexibility needed to respond to evolving requirements of&#13;
educational change at the central and local levels. To this end, the Government developed&#13;
a long-term Strategic Framework which defines the EEP's 13 objectives and the&#13;
interventions it will pursue to achieve these goals. The Strategic Framework will guide&#13;
planning and activities over the 15 to 20 year life of the multiple-phase program. It is&#13;
attached to the Government's Letter of Sectoral Policy (Annex 5), which states that the&#13;
Government is committed to providing all necessary financial and institutional support&#13;
needed to pursue the objectives contained in the Strategic Framework through the&#13;
interventions which it contains. Core program activities will be determined each year&#13;
through an iterative process and will be included in an Annual Work Plan (para. 3.4) to&#13;
be developed by a Planning, Programming and Monitoring Unit (PPMU).&#13;
2.4   Most interventions will be initially conducted on a pilot basis. Sharqia and&#13;
Fayoum Governorates would participate in the first year with locally designed versions&#13;
of central initiatives, and an additional two Governorates would participate in the second&#13;
year. In years three and four more Governorates are expected to participate; the number&#13;
will depend on their capacity and readiness to do so. With two operations over ten years&#13;
it is expected that all Governorates will be covered. It is anticipated that 15 to 20 years&#13;
will be necessary to achieve the Government's long-term reform goals outlined in the&#13;
Strategic Framework for the entire country. The Strategic Framework contains the&#13;
objectives and interventions described below.&#13;
2.5   Improving access.   The goals of this program area are to maintain the high&#13;
enrollment rate for boys and remove the gender disparities in girls enrollment in basic&#13;
education. Continuing a successful Government construction program which has&#13;
significantly improved enrollment, the proposed project will focus on improving&#13;
enrollments in underserved areas through targeting school construction (see Annex 3).&#13;
The needs-based construction program will be targeted using a school mapping exercise&#13;
to select sites for school construction (nearly completed by GAEB during project&#13;
preparation) which incorporates population and enrollment densities.  Previously,&#13;
nominations for school construction sites were forwarded to GAEB by the Governorates,&#13;
a process which allowed criteria other than student needs to be paramount in site&#13;
selection. Under the new system, GAEB will forward to each Governorate a menu of&#13;
sites for school construction based on agreed site selection criteria. Governorates will use&#13;
community preference surveys to choose from this menu (surveys would be conducted&#13;
by consulting firms; implementation would start prior to effectiveness). Strategies to&#13;
increase parental demand for girls education identified in existing research (para. 1.5)&#13;
would be proposed for adoption in culturally conservative areas with low levels of girls&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Education Enhancement Program                                            7&#13;
enrollment, as well as additional measures identified through the community preference&#13;
survey.  Studies to identify measures to provide education to previously unserved&#13;
populations such as the handicapped and out-of-school girls up to the age of 14 will also&#13;
be conducted.&#13;
2.6 Improving the Oualitv of Student Performance. The goals of this program area&#13;
are to significantly increase students' achievement of basic skills and help improve their&#13;
critical thinking skills in those Governorates participating in the EEP. The magnitude of&#13;
increase in attainment of these skills by the end of the project will be measured against&#13;
early baseline studies of both domains, which will be designed by the end of 1996.&#13;
National success with these goals can be expected in ten to fifteen years as&#13;
implementation of most interventions which drive their achievement will require at least&#13;
two five-year project cycles. There are four specific objectives in this program area: (i)&#13;
reduce wastage (repetition and dropout); (ii) improve the quality of teaching and&#13;
learning; (iii) improve the quality of the pre-service training program; and (iv) build the&#13;
capacity of implementing agencies key to this program area. These objectives are&#13;
interlinked: building implementing agencies' capacity will be key to the success of the&#13;
whole quality program, while improving training will lead to improvements in teaching&#13;
and learning, which will in turn reduce repetition and dropouts.&#13;
2.7    Reducing wastage will be accomplished through two approaches: reducing class&#13;
size (frequently as high as 60-70) and multiple shifts through school construction, to be&#13;
pursued starting in the first year of the program, and provision of support to students with&#13;
moderate leaming difficulties (i.e. those who fall behind in one or more subjects). The&#13;
latter approach will be pursued through training a cadre of learning support teachers to&#13;
work with these students.3 This has been a cost-effective means in other countries of&#13;
preventing minor student failure from precipitating discouragement, behavior problems,&#13;
and dropping out. It will require prior reform of the pre-service and in-service teacher&#13;
training programs and therefore cannot be started in the first year of the program.&#13;
2.8   Improving the quality of teaching and learning would be achieved through five&#13;
approaches designed to facilitate tailoring teaching to students' learning needs: (i)&#13;
reforming in-service teacher training; (ii) ensuring effective use in schools and&#13;
classrooms of the Government's investment in technology and distance learning; (iii)&#13;
instituting student learning assessments to facilitate accountability of teachers, principals&#13;
and others throughout the sector; (iv) introducing quality assurance systems for&#13;
experienced teachers; and (v) improving the quality of pre-service teacher training&#13;
programs. Quality assurance systems for experienced teachers would be pursued through&#13;
increasing the validity of annual teacher performance evaluations and creating merit-&#13;
based promotion criteria. A system of regular school inspections based on objective&#13;
criteria to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of individual schools would be&#13;
developed as a quality assurance system for schools. The in-service training reform, with&#13;
the greatest potential impact on the quality of learning, would institute a distance training&#13;
3   The phrase "moderate leaniing difficulties" is at times used to refer to handicapped students; that is&#13;
not the case here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                      Egypt: Education Enhancement Program&#13;
system with master teachers acting as facilitators in locally based learning centers, and&#13;
would replace the current minimal and ritualistic cascade-based in-service training&#13;
system. The aim of the system would be to create continuous and collegial cooperation&#13;
among teachers to improve practice, and to change the teaching and learning culture of&#13;
the school by training its staff as a group in order to develop their capacity to solve&#13;
pedagogical problems.&#13;
2.9   Interventions to improve the quality of pre-service programs focus on inputs&#13;
(including the quality of students who enter these programs), process, and outputs.&#13;
Incentives would be created for training institutions to address specific problems in their&#13;
programs. Pre-service institutions which participate in a quality assessment (to be based&#13;
on criteria and indicators created by a joint domestic and foreign task force) would be&#13;
eligible to apply for grants of up to one million dollars from an Improvement Fund to be&#13;
administered by the PPMU (see Annex 6). Grants would be awarded on a competitive&#13;
basis. Grant applications would respond to findings of the institutional quality assessment&#13;
with strategies to remedy the major weaknesses which it identifies. This scheme would&#13;
be assessed through independent, national credentialling examinations for graduates of&#13;
participating institutions.&#13;
2.10 Improving System Efficienc . The goals of this program area are to improve&#13;
system efficiency through improving the management of sector resources and to enable&#13;
improvements in system effectiveness through enhancing sector planning, decision&#13;
making and management.&#13;
2.11  Reform  of the decision-making process will be a crucial element for&#13;
strengthening system effectiveness and efficiency. This process is currently both highly&#13;
centralized and susceptible to arbitrary intervention at each successive level of authority.&#13;
In order to introduce a more broadly based approach founded on technical analysis and&#13;
objective data, the Ministry of Education has established the PPMU, which reports&#13;
directly to the Minister's Office (para. 3.4). The PPMU will consist of 16 full time&#13;
professional staff as well as a complement of support staff. The Director, Deputy&#13;
Director and two staff are in place; four Section Heads will be appointed prior to&#13;
negotiations. In order to plan objectives and activities for each area of the EEP, the&#13;
PPM[J engaged expert panels with membership from the Government, the private sector&#13;
and international technical experts. A similar process will take place for the development&#13;
of Governorate plans at the local level, with the participation of NGOs, parents, teachers&#13;
and headmasters. Institutionalization of this process would be a major project benefit.&#13;
2.12  The innovative and comprehensive nature of the EEP would require an intensive&#13;
process of capacity building, particularly in participatory planning and management,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, and in areas related to improvement of pedagogy. The PPMU&#13;
will work with sector agencies to increase capacity in these areas. A capacity building&#13;
fund for training, studies, national and foreign technical assistance, study visits and other&#13;
capacity building measures would be established to facilitate this process. The PPMU&#13;
would identify capacity building needs which emerge in the course of implementation, as&#13;
well as appropriate measures to address these needs, and would assist implementing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Education Enhancement Program                                       9&#13;
agencies to develop capacity building proposals. Continuous self assessment of capacity&#13;
building needs would be part of the management task of each Implementing Agency,&#13;
including the PPMU itself.&#13;
2.13  Interventions to build the capacity of implementing agencies would initially&#13;
emphasize strengthening various MOE departments (and other government education&#13;
agencies) at both the central and Governorate levels to enable them to better perform&#13;
program responsibilities. Governorate level agencies for example would have primary&#13;
management responsibility for implementing the in-service and school inspection&#13;
reforms, both of which involve restructuring the currently ineffective Inspectorate Corps.&#13;
Central agencies would be responsible for developing assessments of student learning&#13;
and for providing a model for merit-based assessments for teacher evaluation and&#13;
promotion, among other substantial activities. Improving the capacity to perform these&#13;
tasks would itself be a key project contribution.&#13;
2.14  Alternative building designs were developed during project preparation by&#13;
technical panels described above. The least-cost design will be implemented and will&#13;
result in projected cost savings of approximately US$70 million per year compared to the&#13;
original construction plan. With regard to the use of human resources, studies on means&#13;
to link teacher compensation and incentives to performance in order to increase&#13;
accountability will be conducted (Annex 2). These studies would be conducted initially&#13;
in the pilot Governorates. Results would be used as input for policy recommendations.&#13;
C. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.15  The proposed project is fully consistent with the CAS recommendation to support&#13;
human resources development (Report Number P-6263-EGT, discussed by the Board on&#13;
March 24, 1994). The project will pursue this goal by supporting the Government's&#13;
efforts to implement its national education program at an ambitious but politically&#13;
feasible pace.&#13;
2.16  IDA involvement in this initiative is the result of high-level policy discussions&#13;
held with the Government in August 1995, as well as the EU's support for sectoral&#13;
reform in basic education as part of its cooperation with Mediterranean countries. IDA&#13;
and the EU have worked together closely in joint missions and discussions with the&#13;
Government, and plan to continue this cooperation throughout the life of the program.&#13;
IDA has also been asked by the donor community to take the lead in the education sector&#13;
to facilitate coordinated support to the Government. Furthermore, this project represents&#13;
the first in a potential series of policy-related interventions in various areas of the&#13;
Egyptian education sector. Providing successful assistance to the Government in its&#13;
efforts to improve the coverage, quality and efficiency of basic education would facilitate&#13;
dialogue on other priority issues in the sector: higher education, general secondary&#13;
education, vocational training and education financing. IDA will pursue a dialogue with&#13;
the Government on these issues in tandem with the implementation of this operation for&#13;
basic education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
i0                                        Egypt: Education Enhancement Program&#13;
2.17  IDA's experience in sectoral analysis and institution building is well suited to the&#13;
Government's present needs for improving sector performance in management and&#13;
decision making, and will contribute to strengthening MOE's ability to perform policy&#13;
planning and coordination functions. IDA's broad sectoral perspective would facilitate&#13;
the continuous refinement of a basic education strategy through collaboration on AWPs&#13;
for project implementation.&#13;
3.   PROJECT COST, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
3.1    Total project costs, which support core activities of the EEP, are estimated at LE&#13;
3.35 billion or US$835.52 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of&#13;
US$270.12 million or about 32 percent of total program costs. Base cost estimates were&#13;
calculated using June 1996 prices. Physical contingencies represent 9 percent of base&#13;
costs, and price contingencies 19 percent of base costs.4 Detailed project costs are shown&#13;
in Annex 7.&#13;

3.2   Financing. ITF funds would be disbursed against the core program activities of&#13;
the EEP.  The EU  would support the entire program  through tranche release&#13;
disbursements against Guiding Criteria and Indicators agreed with the Government. The&#13;
proposed ITF credit of SDR 51.5 million, (US$75 million equivalent) would finance&#13;
three program components: Access and Equity, Quality of Student Performance and&#13;
System Efficiency, as shown in Table 3.1 above.  The EU is expected to contribute&#13;
US$125 million in co-financing. The Government's expenditure for EEP would be&#13;
maintained at its present level, which would amount to US$10.9 billion over the project's&#13;
five-year span, of which US$635.5 million would support core activities of the EEP.&#13;
ITF would support priority items within the core program not funded by the&#13;
Price contingencies were derived from expected annual price increases as follows: foreign: 2.3&#13;
percent in 1997 and 1998, 2.4 percent in 1999 and 2000, and 2.5 percent in 2001; local: 8 percent in&#13;
1997, 7.5 percent in 1998, 9.1 percent in 2000, and 9.3 percent in 2001.&#13;

B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.3   The program will be implemented over a five-year period beginning in January&#13;
1997. ITF disbursement would begin about June 30, 1997; the closing date would be&#13;
December 31, 2002. The Government's Sectoral Policy Letter, Organizational Charts and&#13;
Implementation Schedule are presented in Annexes 5, 8 and 9. The following is a&#13;
summary of the implementation arrangements.&#13;
3.4   Planning &amp; Programming. The PPMU, which reports directly to the Minister of&#13;
Education (para. 2.11), will be responsible for programming, coordinating and&#13;
monitoring implementation. It will work with the Ministry, Governorates and donors to&#13;
identify a comprehensive program of activities to be defined each year in an AWP and to&#13;
monitor its implementation. The AWP would incorporate priority activities needed to&#13;
achieve interventions identified in the Strategic Framework. Proposals from&#13;
Governorate-level PPMU (GPPMU) counterpart units would be discussed with the MOE&#13;
as part of the planning process for each AWP and would ensure that interventions are&#13;
consistent with local needs.&#13;
3.5   AWPs would be developed by the Government on the basis of progress in the&#13;
implementation of the program, development of the education system, and priorities and&#13;
issues identified through self-monitoring indicators used by each Implementing Agency&#13;
(see para. 3.13). These indicators would allow contemporaneous and continuous&#13;
identification of problems. This program approach would allow the flexibility needed in&#13;
a large and complex sector, where activities will need to evolve each year based on&#13;
continuous feedback. It would also assist the Government to identify, plan and carry out&#13;
complementary activities by providing a coherent framework for the program as a whole.&#13;
3.6  IDA and other donors would provide assistance in preparing AWPs as needed and&#13;
upon the Government's request. While formal IDA approval of AWPs would not be&#13;
necessary, review and discussion of draft AWPs by IDA, the ITF administrator, would&#13;
take place each year, and would constitute a key area of IDA assistance to the&#13;
Government. IDA review of draft AWPs would focus on three factors: (i) overall&#13;
internal coherence of the Plan among its various components; (ii) consistency with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                     Egypt: Education Enhancement Program&#13;
past year's plan, particularly whether the Plan reflects progress made in the previous year&#13;
by including activities which may be identified as necessary to achieve Strategic&#13;
Framework interventions or dropping activities or components which have proven&#13;
infeasible; and (iii) a donor/Government financing plan to ensure that all program&#13;
activities are fully funded.&#13;
3.7   Implementation. Program activities would be implemented by various agencies&#13;
within and outside the Government. Implementing Agencies (lAs) would include&#13;
departments of the MOE, educational Centers or Institutes such as the NCEEE, the&#13;
CCIMD and the GAEB, Universities and Faculties of Education, In-Service Training&#13;
Institutes, NGOs and consulting firms. During the development of AWPs at the central&#13;
and Governorate level, lAs would be identified for each activity or group of tasks. In&#13;
some cases, the PPMU will identify an IA after definition of the AWP (usually in the&#13;
case of activities to be undertaken by consulting firms). Implementing Agencies would&#13;
operate under contract (in the case of NGOs and private firms) or under a formal and&#13;
binding agreement (in the case of Government entities) with the PPMU. These contracts&#13;
or agreements would include Terms of Reference, Performance Indicators and&#13;
requirements for progress reporting.&#13;
3.8   Coordination. Overall management of the program would be carried out by the&#13;
PPMU. The unit will have direct linkages with Governorate level officials, university&#13;
Faculties of Education and autonomous education entities such as GAEB, CCIMD, and&#13;
NCEEE. The PPMU coordinated the development of the Strategic Framework, the first&#13;
year AWP (Annex 10), and performance indicators. It will be responsible for&#13;
coordinating development of future AWPs and indicators.&#13;
3.9   The PPMU will ensure coherence between local and central activities, provide&#13;
technical assistance to implementing agencies, and provide feedback for program&#13;
implementation. The Unit will also undertake all reporting activities for both donor&#13;
supervision and government requirements. The Unit's staff will be supported, as needed,&#13;
by technical panels composed of Egyptian and international experts from the public and&#13;
private sectors. An Operations Manual for the PPMU, outlining procedures for all areas&#13;
of its work and criteria for AWP design and approval, has been drafted and submitted to&#13;
IDA, the ITF administrator.&#13;
3.10 A Coordinating Committee will monitor IA performance and serve as a forum to&#13;
ensure that duplication of activities is avoided and that obstacles to implementation are&#13;
removed. The Committee will be chaired by the PPMU Director. Its membership will&#13;
include those lAs with responsibility for major portions of the EEP, and representatives&#13;
of participating Governorates as well as relevant Central Ministries. Oversight will be&#13;
facilitated by the Monitoring Section of the PPMU, which will use feedback from&#13;
program performance indicators (para. 3.13-3.15) tracked through the Computerized&#13;
Management Information System, which provides real time monitoring of progress&#13;
indicators. The Monitoring Section at the central or Governorate level will produce&#13;
quarterly "exception reports" to identify problems in implementation. The Coordinating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Education Enhancement Program                                     13&#13;
Committee will intercede in those cases where implementation problems cannot be&#13;
solved by the IA itself.&#13;
3.11 Governorate PPMUs. Management of the program at the Governorate level&#13;
would be carried out by small Govemorate PPMU counterpart units (the first will be&#13;
established in a pilot Governorate by October 1996). These units will direct planning&#13;
and implementation of local level program activities in response to specific needs in the&#13;
community (Annex 11). This process will require close cooperation with mudirriya&#13;
(Governorate level) and idarra (district level) education officials to ensure that activities&#13;
are not duplicated. Two committees would be established at the Governorate level for&#13;
this purpose. A Supreme Consultative Committee, chaired by the Undersecretary of&#13;
Education for the mudirriya, would provide guidance and supervision for planning and&#13;
implementation of local program activities. A Local Advisory Body, with broad&#13;
representation from public, NGO, and private sector bodies, would engender community&#13;
support. It would also draw on the experience of public and private social service&#13;
agencies and promote coordination with them when appropriate.&#13;
3.12 Supervision. The EU will place one staff member in Cairo throughout the life of&#13;
the project to facilitate implementation. There would be two joint IDA-EU supervision&#13;
missions, no later than May 30 and November 30 each year. The second supervision&#13;
mission of each year would review development of the next year's AWP and the&#13;
Government's Public Investment Program for education, including a breakdown of&#13;
investment by level of education. The joint supervision team would focus on: (a) the&#13;
consistency of activities in each component and sub-project with agreements reached at&#13;
appraisal; (b) performance of the implementing groups and institutions; (c) assessment of&#13;
emerging needs for adjustments to project parameters; (d) progress of project&#13;
implementation; and (e) progress of institutional reforms. The joint supervision tearn&#13;
would base supervision on the Government's monitoring reports and annual evaluation of&#13;
project activities against input, process and output indicators (Annex 4). In addition,&#13;
supervision missions would review project expenditures and availability of financial&#13;
resources, as well as conduct discussions with MOE officials and the IDA/EU Resident&#13;
Missions. A mid-term review would be conducted in September 1999.&#13;
D. PERFORMANCE NDICATORS&#13;
3.13  Three separate sets of performance indicators would be used for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. The first is a set of activity-specific indicators accompanying the AWP. The&#13;
second set focuses on annual output targets, and the third on five-year output targets. In&#13;
order to build monitoring and evaluation capacity in the PPMU as well as Governorate&#13;
level PPMUs, training will be provided to staff in these units during the first year of their&#13;
operation in the use of the indicator sets.&#13;
3.14  To simplify the monitoring process, the activity-specific indicator set (which is&#13;
contained in the "Implementation Plan and Performance Indicators", Annex 4) consists&#13;
of detailed yes/no questions which will allow the PPMU to trace whether required inputs&#13;
are in place, process steps completed and planned outputs achieved for individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                     Egypt: Education Enhancement Program&#13;
activities in the AWP. Each of the Implementing Agencies will use these indicators to&#13;
monitor their respective activities and report to the PPMU. This will provide a fast&#13;
indication to all local bodies when problems or bottlenecks arise, allowing for quick&#13;
adjustment to circumstances. A new set of activity-specific indicators will be developed&#13;
each year as part of the AWP planning process.&#13;
3.15  As the detailed set of task specific indicators would not provide useful aggregate&#13;
information concerning the program's success in meeting its overall yearly targets, a set&#13;
of six annual output indicators which refer to the project's long term Development&#13;
Objectives was developed. These indicators measure the output of logical groupings of&#13;
activities contained in the AWP to show progress toward annual and long-term&#13;
objectives. As with the detailed performance indicators for individual activities, a new&#13;
set of annual output indicators would be developed each year as part of the AWP&#13;
preparation process. These indicators will also be used by the PPMU as a framework for&#13;
preparing implementation reports for review by IDA-EU supervision missions.&#13;
3.16  A third set of indicators will be used at the end of the project to evaluate progress&#13;
in achieving its five-year targets. Rather than measuring progress in creating specific&#13;
outputs or combinations of outputs as do the first two sets of indicators, the Five-Year&#13;
Performance Indicators measure outcomes or results of project activities. Outcomes will&#13;
be measured against baseline data in critical areas such as student (particularly girls)&#13;
enrollments, performance in basic skills, and effective decision making and&#13;
implementation of program activities at the national and local levels.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.17  Procurement arrangements for works, goods and services to be financed under the&#13;
proposed credit and contract review requirements are summarized in Annex 12. The&#13;
PPMU, and the GPPMUs would be responsible for procuring goods and services relating&#13;
to their components, and GAEB would be responsible for procuring related civil works.&#13;
The existing MOE Project Implementation Unit, because of its extensive experience with&#13;
ITF-financed projects, would provide technical assistance to the PPMIU. The PPMU&#13;
would be responsible for overall monitoring of the procurement process and ensuring that&#13;
all works, goods, and services to be financed under the project jointly, or solely, by ITF&#13;
would be procured in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996). To expedite&#13;
procurement, the Government would establish special tender committees for civil works&#13;
and goods.&#13;
3.18  With regard to Technical Assistance (TA), qualified firms or institutions as well&#13;
as individual specialists would be invited to submit proposals for a comprehensive&#13;
package of consultant services and fellowships in accordance with the Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency (August 1981). TA would be contracted in accordance with the terms of&#13;
reference packaging and schedule agreed with IDA, the ITF administrator, during&#13;
Annual Reviews.&#13;

3.19 The proceeds of the ITF Credit may only be withdrawn on account of&#13;
expenditures for goods and works provided by nationals of, and produced in or supplied&#13;
from, countries participating in the ITF; consequently, nationals of countries that are not&#13;
Participating Countries and bidders offering goods and works from such countries shall&#13;
be disqualified from bidding for such contracts, and the bidding documents shall so&#13;
specify. Only consultants from Participating Countries shall be eligible to provide&#13;
services financed out the proceeds of the ITF Credit.&#13;
F. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.20   The proposed credit would be disbursed in about 5.5 years over the period 1997-&#13;
2002. This is shorter than the country disbursement profile of 16 semesters. This period&#13;
is deemed feasible in view of the fact that: (a) project preparation is at an advanced level&#13;
(e.g. standard school designs and a first year AWP have been prepared); and (b) some&#13;
activities will be initiated with donor financing prior to credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.21   The proposed credit of SDR 51.5 million (US$75 million equivalent), would be&#13;
disbursed against the categories contained in the following table.&#13;

3.23  Special Account.  To facilitate prompt payments and disbursements from the&#13;
credit proceeds, the Government would establish, maintain and operate under terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA, a Special Account (SA) in US dollars in a commercial&#13;
bank. The authorized allocation of the special account is $5 million, but the initial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                     Egypt: Education Enhancement Program&#13;
deposit is limited to $3 million until $10 million has been disbursed.  Separate&#13;
identifiable accounts would be kept for all project expenditures and supporting&#13;
documentation would be retained for subsequent review by World Bank Resident&#13;
Mission staff and visiting IDA supervision missions. The PPMU would provide IDA&#13;
with monthly SA statements. The SA would be replenished on a monthly basis, or when&#13;
the undisbursed balance falls below 50 percent of the authorized allocation, whichever is&#13;
sooner, upon submission by the PPMU of a replenishment request to IDA with the&#13;
necessary supporting documentation. Disbursements would be made against standard&#13;
IDA documentation. Disbursement for civil works will be made against quantities of&#13;
schools completed according to agreed criteria and unit costs during Annual Reviews.&#13;
Expenditures for this component, for goods contracts less than US$250,000, for&#13;
individual consultants' contracts less than US$50,000, for consulting firms contracts less&#13;
than US$100,000, and for Improvement Grants, would be reimbursed against Statements&#13;
of Expenditure (SOEs), for which the related documentation would be retained for&#13;
review by IDA supervision missions. The Government has agreed that the SA would be&#13;
audited in conjunction with the annual audit of project accounts. Requests for direct&#13;
payment would be subject to a minimum application size equal to about 20 percent of the&#13;
authorized allocation in the SA.&#13;
G. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, AND REPORTING&#13;
3.24 Accounts and AudIting. The Borrower is in compliance with Bank audit&#13;
reporting covenants. The Borrower will establish and maintain separate project-related&#13;
accounts at the PPMU. These accounts will be maintained in accordance with sound and&#13;
internationally recognized accounting practices in an accounting system acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The PPMU will provide interim and annual financial statements to reflect the&#13;
financial performance and position of the entity and the project. An auditor's opinion&#13;
and reports satisfactory to IDA on such statements will be provided within six of months&#13;
of the close of the fiscal year. The auditor's report will include a statement on the&#13;
adequacy of the accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of statements of&#13;
expenditures as a basis for credit disbursements, and compliance with financial&#13;
covenants. These project accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements&#13;
should provide adequate and timely information to IDA for supervision of the project.&#13;
3.25   Reporting. The PPMU would prepare AWPs in consultation with expert panels&#13;
and lAs, and forward these to IDA for discussion by no later than October 30 each year.&#13;
The PPMU would prepare semi-annual progress reports against AWNP indicators. These&#13;
reports would discuss problems encountered, solutions adopted, and modifications to the&#13;
AWP. In addition to these reporting tasks, the PPMU would continually track program&#13;
implementation progress through a computerized monitoring system containing the&#13;
detailed input, process and output indicators for each AWP activity. This would allow&#13;
identification of problems contemporaneously with their appearance, and thereby enable&#13;
identification of solutions in a matter of weeks.&#13;
3.26  The PPMU would prepare a detailed mid-term report and submit it to IDA/EU&#13;
by the end of September 1999 to serve as the basis for the mid-term review, which IDA,&#13;
&#13;

Egypt: Educatdon Enhancement Program                                   1J7&#13;
the EU and the Borrower will conduct by December 31, 1999. The PPMU would also&#13;
prepare an Implementation Completion Report within three months of the Closing Date&#13;
of the credit. During negotiations, assurances will be sought from the Government on all&#13;
reporting requirements in addition to the following arrangements for project monitoring&#13;
and reporting: the PPMU acting in close consultation with GPPMUs and lAs, would&#13;
provide on a semi-annual basis consolidated reports (comprising, inter alia, the reports of&#13;
GPPMUs and Governorate and other Implementing Agencies and the PPMU's comments&#13;
thereon) on project implementation progress covering: (a) project activities, financing&#13;
requirements and budget provisions; (b) monthly cash flow projections for the next six&#13;
month period; and (c) status of procurement of works, goods, consulting services,&#13;
training, and improvement grants. Any major variance from the budget would be&#13;
explained and corrective measures proposed. These reports would be submitted to IDA&#13;
within one month of the end of the relevant semester, and would provide the basis for&#13;
monitoring project progress and for discussions at the formal joint bi-annual reviews by&#13;
IDA and EU. These reviews would be conducted no later than May 30 and November 30&#13;
each year.&#13;
H. PROJECT OBJECTIVE CATEGORY&#13;
3.27  Although poverty alleviation is not an explicit objective of this project, the&#13;
educational quality improvements resulting from the project are expected to have a&#13;
favorable impact on the poverty profile in Egypt in the long term. With respect to gender&#13;
issues, the project will improve educational opportunities for girls in rural areas, which&#13;
will lead to enhanced earning prospects for women as well as reduced fertility levels and&#13;
improved maternal and child health indicators.&#13;
1. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
3.28  The project is classified as Category "C" and no adverse environmental impact&#13;
from the proposed project is expected. Civil works design will be reviewed by IDA to&#13;
ensure that materials proposed for rehabilitation or construction are environmentally&#13;
sound. Construction contracts will specify that building activities be carried out in an&#13;
environmentally sound manner and that construction waste be disposed of properly.&#13;
J. PARTICIPATORY APPROACH&#13;
3.29  The design process for this operation has been a joint effort by the PPMU,&#13;
Egyptian technical panels, the EU and IDA. Because of this, the Government and&#13;
EU/IDA missions have been able to develop a close partnership through a participatory&#13;
process. This partnership resulted in the production of the Strategic Framework, the first&#13;
year Annual Work Plan, and project performance indicators. Interaction and partnership&#13;
will continue throughout implementation with the aim of encouraging maximum&#13;
Egyptian initiative and responsibility for the program. During implementation, the&#13;
process is intended to also involve headmasters, teachers and parents to engender at the&#13;
local level the support and ownership of the program necessary to effect the type of&#13;
systemic changes proposed in this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.   BENEFITS, RISKS AND ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
4.1   The following benefits would be realized: (a) a decision-making process based on&#13;
objective data and technical analysis would be institutionalized; (b) near universal&#13;
enrollment of boys in basic education would be maintained; (c) girls enrollment would be&#13;
increased to a level of nearly universal level in basic education; (d) student achievement&#13;
would be measurably improved in pilot governorates and nationwide improvement will&#13;
be realized in the long term; (e) a more efficient use of public funds would be obtained in&#13;
the education sector; and (f) in the long term, a more educated labor force would be&#13;
developed to meet the challenges of a competitive global economy.&#13;
B. RISKS AND INSTITUTIONAL SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.2   Certain characteristics of the Egyptian education system pose several risks to the&#13;
successful achievement of the project's goals. These are summarized below.&#13;
4.3   First, existing decision-making mechanisms make initiatives vulnerable to&#13;
arbitrary interventions at each successive level of authority. The project has been&#13;
designed to minimize this risk by instituting a system of technical panels to provide&#13;
recommendations for policy decisions. Second, the system's focus on rules and&#13;
regulations constitutes a pervasive risk to far-reaching change. Rigid adherence to new&#13;
processes and regulations intended to achieve reforms can subvert the types of activities&#13;
needed to improve student learning. The project addresses this problem in two ways: by&#13;
setting up merit-based evaluations of institutions and personnel throughout the system,&#13;
and by shifting the focus of the system from rules and regulations to student learning.&#13;
4.4   Third, the system's focus on following rules rather than on student learning&#13;
contravenes the initiative, judgment, and critical thinking that teachers must exhibit in&#13;
order to respond to their students' learning needs and impart critical thinking skills.&#13;
Moreover, the teaching of these skills has often encountered broad cultural resistance in&#13;
other countries. The project has been designed to minimize these risks by phasing and&#13;
piloting implementation of activities in this area by Governorate, in order to take&#13;
advantage of lessons learned in local conditions. The in-service teacher training reform&#13;
should contribute to acceptance by teachers of new teaching practices: it uses in training&#13;
situations the same techniques which teachers will need to employ in the classroom.&#13;
Particular attention is paid to community perceptions and actual practice regarding the&#13;
teaching of these skills as part of preparation for in-service teacher training activities in&#13;
each participating Governorate. The Government, IDA and the EU acknowledge that&#13;
progress in developing these skills will be slower than improvement of basic skills.&#13;
4.5   Fourth, because they distort incentives, the low wages which prevail in the sector&#13;
constitute a serious threat to achievement of project objectives.  Many teachers&#13;
supplement their income by giving private lessons, and for those who do, there is an&#13;
economic incentive to concentrate their efforts on their private rather than classroom&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Education Enhancement Program                                         19&#13;
instruction. This incentive represents a risk to efforts to improve the quality of student&#13;
performance in government schools. Because restructuring compensation and staffing&#13;
levels in education cannot be accomplished in isolation from the rest of the public sector,&#13;
program-specific actions to mitigate this risk are not feasible at this time. However,&#13;
studies to identify possible solutions to this issue, including the formulation of specific&#13;
policy recommendations, are mandated in the Strategic Framework. These would&#13;
estimate the impact of a variety of incentive schemes on learning achievements. The&#13;
study panel will take fiscal constraints and civil service rules into account in formulating&#13;
its recommendations (Annex 2).&#13;
4.6   Fifth, the compartmentalization of responsibilities in educational development&#13;
and administration presents various problems. It results in wastage of resources through&#13;
duplication of efforts, in counter-productive behavior through rivalry among parallel&#13;
groups, and in the loss of newly acquired skills, since an agency will not apply improved&#13;
capacities if there is no demand for its output from other parts of the system. The&#13;
PPMU, in its coordination function and capacity as executive arm and policy&#13;
implementation branch of the Office of the Minister, will minimize this risk by&#13;
integrating the work of various sector bodies. In addition, program interventions are&#13;
designed in many cases to transform the functions and skills of current staff, rather than&#13;
to create parallel structures.&#13;
4.7   Finally, as implementation of the EEP would promote institutional and attitudinal&#13;
change in all spheres of the basic education system, it is likely to provoke resistance from&#13;
individuals who might feel threatened in their particular field of competence. An&#13;
imperative for the program therefore is to convince all actors of the need for and&#13;
feasibility of envisaged institutional changes. The project would attempt to engender a&#13;
shared understanding of program strategies among all relevant actors through seminars&#13;
and workshops, and through capacity building measures. The participatory approach to&#13;
planning AWPs would serve to encourage actors to articulate their views and contribute&#13;
actively to the development of the program throughout project implementation.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.8   Rate of return analysis is not applicable since the lack of accurate data on income&#13;
variation according to educational attainment makes the quantification of benefits&#13;
impossible. However, international research has conclusively shown that improving the&#13;
quality of education and increasing access to it yields important positive externalities:&#13;
opportunities for the poor to increase their productivity, income and social mobility;&#13;
lower fertility and improved public health and nutrition through better education of girls;&#13;
and promotion of social and political solidarity. In addition, improving the quality of&#13;
education in Egypt will be crucial if macroeconomic, labor and trade reforms are to have&#13;
their intended effects on employment, growth and income.&#13;
4.9   Financial sustainability analysis of interventions identified in the EEP shows that&#13;
the implied incremental expenditures would be easily covered within any likely&#13;
macroeconomic and budget context. From 1991 to 1996, public education expenditures&#13;
rose an average of 6 percent per year in real terms, and pre-university expenditures by 8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                     Egypt: Education Enhancement Program&#13;
percent, while real total government spending dropped an average of I percent per year.&#13;
Education's share of total Government investment rose from 6 to 18 percent and its share&#13;
of total government current expenditures rose from 16 to 19 percent over the six-year&#13;
period. As a result, public education financing, which was 12 percent of total government&#13;
expenditure in 1991, is projected to be LE 11 billion in 1996. It now represents over 5&#13;
percent of GDP. While allocations of 71 to 73 percent of total recurrent expenditure to&#13;
pre-university education in most of the reference period are moderately low by&#13;
international standards (i.e., 80 to 86 percent for regional averages of low and medium-&#13;
income countries), there is no evidence of public underfunding at the lower levels.&#13;
Through the 1990s, average annual increases in per student allocations have been&#13;
significant: in the primary stage, per-student expenditure has risen by 4 percent, in&#13;
preparatory by 5 percent, and in secondary by 3 percent per year. Current per-student&#13;
allocation estimates of US$135 in primary, US$184 in preparatory and US$274 in&#13;
secondary education are high in relation to comparator countries.&#13;
4.10 As part of the preparation of each year's AWP, the Government will make its&#13;
Public Investment Program for education available to IDA, including a breakdown of&#13;
investment by level of education. World Bank projections forecast that growth of total&#13;
government current and fixed-investment spending will fall between 0.2 and 4.5 percent&#13;
from 1995 to 2012. If actual growth is at the low end of this range, then incremental&#13;
expenditures due to the EEP would be less than one percent of pre-university education&#13;
expenditures in 2002, the first year after completion of the first phase of the program,&#13;
assuming zero real growth in education spending (Table 5, Annex 14). In 2011,&#13;
incremental expenditures would represent only two to four percent of pre-university&#13;
expenditures, assuming zero to five percent real annual growth in these categories from&#13;
1997 to 2011. Even if education spending declines by three percent per year during this&#13;
period, incremental expenditures due to the program would still represent only six&#13;
percent of the total in 2011. These amounts could easily be financed by the Government&#13;
with minimal adjustment to its overall budget.&#13;
4.11  Least-Cost analysis was conducted for the two most costly components in the&#13;
program: school construction and in-service teacher training. With regard to the first of&#13;
these, as a result of IDA technical support, the Government has adopted a new school&#13;
design for primary school construction that contains a more effective layout of&#13;
classrooms and circulation.  Based on projections of the Government's school&#13;
construction program, this will result in savings of approximately US$70 million per&#13;
year. Cost savings per student place vary among different models of schools. Unit cost&#13;
savings are 9 percent in purely preparatory schools, 14 percent in mixed&#13;
primary/preparatory and 17 percent in purely primary schools, as compared to original&#13;
construction plans. Two alternatives for in-service teacher training were identified:&#13;
(i) reform the current cascade training system, which now performs poorly; or&#13;
(ii) implement an integrated distance-learning-based system. Evidence from Sri Lanka&#13;
shows that teacher training based on distance learning techniques is three times as cost-&#13;
effective as campus-based teacher training. Savings are predicated on economies of scale&#13;
inherent in distance-education available in large countries such as Egypt. This type of&#13;
training provides higher learning interaction and the benefits of group learning processes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Education Enhancement Program                                    21&#13;
while avoiding distortion of content. Little data exist to provide cost figures for either&#13;
option in Egypt. A schematic qualitative comparison of the cost and other advantages and&#13;
disadvantages of the two options is contained in Annex 14.&#13;
5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.12 At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it will:&#13;
(a)   prepare Annual Work Plans, designed according to the Objectives of the&#13;
Strategic Framework as specified in the Letter of Sectoral Policy, in&#13;
consultation with expert panels and Implementation Agencies, and&#13;
forward these to IDA for discussion by October 30 of each year (para.&#13;
3.25);&#13;
(b)   continually  track  program  implementation  progress  through  a&#13;
computerized monitoring system containing the detailed input, process&#13;
and output indicators for each AWP activity (para. 3.25);&#13;
(c)   hold bi-annual reviews with IDA and EU no later than May 30 and&#13;
November 30 of each year to review project implementation progress&#13;
covering:&#13;
(i)   project activities, financing requirements and budget provisions;&#13;
(ii)   monthly cash flow projections for the next six month period; and&#13;
(iii) status of procurement of works, goods, consulting services,&#13;
training, and improvement grants (para. 3.26).&#13;
(d)   prepare a detailed mid-term report and submit it to IDA/EU by the end of&#13;
September 1999, to serve as the basis for the mid-term review, which&#13;
IDA, the EU and the borrower will conduct by December 31, 1999 (para.&#13;
3.26).&#13;
5.13  The project constitutes a suitable basis for an ITF Credit of US$75 million to the&#13;
Arab Republic of Egypt.&#13;

Table 11: Projection of Classroom Needs in Basic Education&#13;
For Govemment Schools in 1996/97 - 2010/11&#13;
This projectlon model is based on Grade Transition Model. Net Intake Rate (NIR), Gross Intake Rate (GIR), and Gross&#13;
Transition Rate (GTR) are used to project enrollment. The model assumes that Net Enrollment Ratio would reach 100% for all&#13;
all basic education tages In 2010/11. Model uses CAPMAS population projection and it does NOT Include lindergarten classrooms.&#13;
Following statics and assumptions are taken into consideration.&#13;
(a) Exdcluding Al-Azhar schools, 7.1% of primary and 3.6% of preparatory students are in private schools In 1995/96 (MOE statistics).&#13;
(b) AI-Azhar system accounts for 8. 1% of primary and 6.1% of preparatory students In 1995/96 (Al-Azhar statisics).&#13;
(Model assumes above percentages would be constant for the projection period.)&#13;
(c) 44.1% of primary and 48.5% of preparatory government school students are in 2 or 3 shifts schools in 1995/96 (MOE statistics).&#13;
(d) Compound Growth Rates for GTRs are calculated by taking the GTR in 1994/5 - 1995/6 of govemment schools.&#13;
(e) Number of grade 1 primary stage students is calculated by the NIR and GIR, which is set to reach 100% NIR in 2002/03&#13;
for primary giris and boys and to remain 100% until 2010/11.&#13;
(f Number of government school students in the first year of preparatory stage in 1996/97 is calculated by applying GER of&#13;
preparatory first year In 1995/96 to age 12 projected population in 1996/97.&#13;
(g) Grade 5 govemment primary students in 1995/96 would advance to Grade 6 (newly added primary stage) in 1996/97 at the GTR of&#13;
grade 4 to 5 in 1995/96. This would add 1,428,121 students to primary age cohort in 1996/97.&#13;
Projecton results are summarized in tables below.&#13;

ISSUES IN TEACHER COMPENSATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY&#13;
Teachers' salaries in Egypt are so low as to be insufficient to meet basic family needs.&#13;
To supplement incomes, private tutoring has become widespread. Given the importance of&#13;
providing good quality basic education to all children, one suggested solution' is to increase&#13;
salaries, curtail private tutoring and somehow channel a large part of the funds currently spent on&#13;
tutoring (reported to be a staggering LE 7 billion annually, exceeding the MOE and Govemorates&#13;
total budget for education) to the public education system through school improvement funds,&#13;
fimds for extracurricular activities, and other similar purposes. In practice, any solution to the&#13;
problem of low wages in the education sector poses several dilemmas.&#13;
While the starting base salary for a teacher is LE 100 a month, about LE 900 is needed to&#13;
provide a decent living for an average Egyptian family. Low wages are not restricted to teachers,&#13;
but prevail throughout almost all of the civil service. Most civil servants do not eam enough for&#13;
a living, work less than a full day, and supplement their incomes through other means. Given the&#13;
sheer number of civil servants and the weight of the wage bill on the central Government's&#13;
budget, there is very little scope for pay increases in the absence of large staff reductions. The&#13;
latter solution would be difficult for obvious social and political reasons. Virtually no country&#13;
has been able to effectively make redundant large numbers of civil servants.&#13;
Given low pay in public sector jobs, civil servants find ways to supplement their&#13;
incomes. There is no harm to this when "moonlighting" jobs consist of a separate private sector&#13;
activity (such as driving a taxi after regular office hours). The problem arises when tasks in a&#13;
government job are not carried out, or when an existing position is misused, as is the case when&#13;
Govemment pernits are sold by civil servants. In the case of education, distortions due to low&#13;
wages consist of teachers: (i) trying to minimize effective formal teaching hours so as to allow&#13;
more time for private tutoring; and (ii) not providing adequate teaching during regular classes so&#13;
as to create a demand for private tutoring. Poorer students who are unable to pay for private&#13;
tutoring are likely to suffer most.&#13;
Yet, it is also undesirable to curtail or forbid private tutoring. Apart from the practical&#13;
impossibility of enforcing such a prohibition, private tutoring performs a useful function as it&#13;
prepares students for exams and increases student learning. Some studies2 suggest that in Egypt&#13;
private tutoring merely increases the likelihood of passing examinations without benefiting&#13;
leazning achievement. This implies that the problem lies w-ith exams and the examination&#13;
process, rather than with the quality of private tutoring as such. The goal of private tutoring will&#13;
always be to pass examinations; if exams and the examination process were a real test of student&#13;
leamning, there would be little doubt that private tutoring fulfills an extremely useful social&#13;
function at no cost to the Govenmment. In essence, it functions like a private education system.&#13;
Why then is private tutoring in Egypt so widespread and wnhv is the role of formal private&#13;
education relativelv limited (private education is expanding rapidly, even though its share of total&#13;
basic school enrollment -excluding the Al-Azhar system- is less than 10%. Under the right&#13;
See for example, Egypt, Human Development Report, 1995, INP, UNDP, p. 58&#13;
2   See Nader Fergany, A Survey of Access to Primary Education and Acquisition of Basic Literacy&#13;
Sldlls in three Govemorates in Egypt, October 1994.&#13;

conditions, teaching in a classroom is probably equally effective and less costly3 than private&#13;
tutoring). There are two primary possibilities: First, Government regulations might make it&#13;
cumbersome to establish a private school. In Egypt, there is evidence that this is indeed the case:&#13;
a license is required and a public school inspector needs to be paid to inspect a private school. It&#13;
would be useful to examine whether these are "normal" Government requirements, or whether&#13;
they represent an unusual constraint. Second, teachers do not wish to entirely abandon public&#13;
sector jobs. Being a civil servant provides some social security (e.g. health insurance). It can&#13;
also provide additional access and knowledge about the exams and the examination process, or&#13;
partial control over exam outcomes, all of which are key to "successful" private tutoring. Again,&#13;
this seems to suggest that the problem is with the integrity of the examination rather than with&#13;
private tutoring as such.&#13;
A key avenue to be explored is the extent to which formal private education can be&#13;
expanded, and how funds spent on tutoring can be channeled to formal private schools on a&#13;
voluntary basis. Evidently, there is a large untapped market for private education in Egypt and a&#13;
willingness to pay for private education. A major expansion of private education would take&#13;
pressure off public education and provide a larger resource envelope per pupil in the public&#13;
sector. (A significant expansion of private education is already taking place. The big paradox is&#13;
that private tutoring is also a common practice in private schools. One of the reasons cited for&#13;
this is that exams are too demanding and the curriculum to be mastered is too demanding. In this&#13;
case, the problem is with the exams and the curricula.)&#13;
The laws of supply and demand would also suggest that a major expansion of private&#13;
education would drive down its costs. Formal private education would undercut the incentive to&#13;
teach poorly by de-linking poor teaching from the market for privately provided education.&#13;
Alternatively, parents could pool funds to supplement the salaries of teachers in the&#13;
public sector, thereby creating a defacto performance based bonus system. There is evidence that&#13;
this is also already taking place. Again, this would take pressure off public resources and&#13;
undernine the incentive to teach poorly. Both avenues, expansion of private schools and&#13;
supplementing teachers' salaries, should be examined closely.&#13;
It is important to recognize however that the existing system is both very inequitable and&#13;
very expensive. Families reportedly spend as much as 30% of their disposable incomes on&#13;
education. Only the better-off can afford good private tutoring. These are important factors&#13;
favoring a larger role for formal private education. The usual arguments against private&#13;
education are based on equity grounds. But these arguments should be weighted against the&#13;
realities of the existing system: it is expensive, inequitable and untransparent.&#13;
3 In practice, economies of scale are used for private tutoring. In large cities, teachers rent large&#13;
auditoriums to teach students duing the exam period. Annual revenues from this type of activity can&#13;
reach LE 500,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;

Conclusions:&#13;
The scope for substantially increasing teacher pay is very limited. Pay increases for teachers&#13;
should not be considered outside the overall fiscal context, the possible spillover effects to other&#13;
segments of the civil service, and their macroeconomic consequences. The size of the total&#13;
teachers' wage bill is primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
*   Increased differentiation in the bonus system may be introduced.   But in the&#13;
absence of other measures, the impact of increased teacher pay is likely to be very&#13;
limited;&#13;
*   It is essential to measure and monitor leaming achievement and teacher&#13;
performance. Non-performing teachers should be given a non-teaching job. Lacking&#13;
this, any change in the remuneration system is bound to fail;&#13;
*   Changes in the exams and the examination process are probably a key element of&#13;
any successful education reform. The nature of the exams may be the chief causal&#13;
factor for the prevalence of private tutoring in Egypt;&#13;
*   A much better understanding is needed of the role of the private sector in providing&#13;
education, the regulatory obstacles it faces, and the actual problems it confronts; and&#13;
-  An experimental study on teacher compensation and student performance should be&#13;
carried out. A draft terms of reference is attached.&#13;

AN INDICATIVE PROPOSAL FOR A STUDY OF TEACHER MOTIVATION AND COMPENSATION&#13;
WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS?&#13;
There are three problems:&#13;
First, the quality of schooling is by all indications very low.&#13;
Second, teacher compensation (as with all civil service pay) is very low. This requires teachers&#13;
to maintain a second income, either through tutoring or through some other second job.&#13;
Third, all dimensions of teacher compensation (pay, employment, assignment, promotion,&#13;
working conditions) appear unrelated to performance. After some minimal criteria or initial&#13;
employment, all other decisions appear to be driven by (at best) seniority.&#13;
There are, therefore, compelling reasons to believe that changing the level and structure&#13;
of teacher compensation will be an important element of quality improvement. Without a high&#13;
quality, motivated, teaching force all other efforts (e.g. training, pedagogical innovation, etc.) are&#13;
unlikely to be successful.&#13;
However, there are three reasons why research is needed:&#13;
(a)   the teaching force is enormous and therefore significant changes in teacher&#13;
compensation will have macroeconomically important budgetary consequences.&#13;
This makes it vital to get the largest possible gain in quality per additional pound&#13;
of compensation;&#13;
(b)    most current research suggests that across the board pay increases are a very&#13;
ineffective means of improving student learning (a significant amount of&#13;
research shows no link at all between increased average compensation and&#13;
student learning); and&#13;
(c)    both of the above indicate that changes in the structure of compensation, in&#13;
addition to its level, would be a more cost effective means of using pay changes&#13;
to induce improved educational outcomes for students than a simple increase&#13;
alone. However, very little is known about how different forms of compensation&#13;
will affect teacher performance.&#13;
Following is an outline of a studv to help determine the appropriate pas policy.&#13;
The essence of the study would be to randomly assign schools into different groups,&#13;
whereby each of which would receive a different "treatment, " i.e. different forms of&#13;
compensation. In order to address the range of relevant policy questions there need to be at least&#13;
the following five groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
A:    CONTROL&#13;
This set of schools would receive no change at all in school policy. Apart from&#13;
involvement in additional testing they would be treated as all other schools in the Governorate.&#13;
B:    INCREASED PAY, CONSTANT STRUCTURE&#13;
The compensation budget (including for school based administrators) for this set of&#13;
schools would be increased by n percent, but allocated according to the existing structure, so that&#13;
every individual's pay would increase by n percent. N will have to be a large number for several&#13;
reasons. First, since pay is currently very low, marginal changes would probably have no impact&#13;
at all (especially as one of the possible changes of increased compensation would be decreased&#13;
outside employment). Second, since in the incentive systems some will receive higher pay than&#13;
others and no teacher in an experiment should receive less that he or she would have in the&#13;
absence of the experiment, the average increase needs to be large.&#13;
It is important to have a group with increased pay level but unchanged structure, as this&#13;
is the most frequently proposed solution to the problem of teacher compensation.&#13;
C:    SCHOOL BASED INCENTIVE PAY BASED ON LEARNING OUTCOMES&#13;
Within this set of schools, each school would receive a payment that varied according to&#13;
its performance, with performance assessed strictly in terms of the magnitude of the learning&#13;
gains demonstrated by its students. This will obviously require detailed elaboration, but one&#13;
likely structure would be as follows.&#13;
Tests - students would take criterion referenced tests at the end of each vear (the same&#13;
tests will be administered in all schools).&#13;
School ranking - the school ranking will be based on the value added bv the school,&#13;
defined as the learning gain over and above what would have been expected for the school given&#13;
its students' background and characteristics. This would adjust raw test scores to account for the&#13;
fact that schools which receive students with better preparation and motivation are likelv to have&#13;
better raw performance, and will be a difficult task (this has been the experience in other&#13;
countries). The proposal is to test student gain in a first year before the experiment begins, and&#13;
use fiuther gain relative to that baseline as the measure of value-added. (A second possibilitv is&#13;
to use a regression of scores on background characteristics, taking the residuals as the measure of&#13;
school specific value added. This is likely to be more operationallv feasible if the scheme is&#13;
extended to many schools, but would likely introduce complications and disputes over the&#13;
regression, while performance relative to base is a more readily understandable measure).&#13;
School Bonus - the same total increase in compensation that was granted to schools in&#13;
group II will be allocated amongst this set of schools, but the magnitude of the bonus would be a&#13;
linear function of the school ranking described above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
Allocation of the school bonus - The bonus would be paid out over the year following&#13;
that in which it is eamed. There are two ways to distribute the bonus among individuals within&#13;
the school. The first it to specify a simple rule, e.g. all teachers could receive the saime bonus.&#13;
The second is to specify a procedure, e.g. the bonus could be distributed (between compensation&#13;
versus school materials) according to the results of a defined process, such as reaching&#13;
unanimous consent.&#13;
D:    INCENTIVE PAY BASED ON SCHOOL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS&#13;
In this set of schools the total incremental budget would be divided so that incentive pay&#13;
is allocated on rankings of teacher performance based entirely on school system assessments.&#13;
This most closely mirrors the current system, and most educational systems, where perfonnance&#13;
rankings are not based on student tests but on general performance assessments. Currently there&#13;
are three possible sources of rankings for teacher perfonnance within the system: teachers&#13;
ranking their peers, principals and school directors ranking their teachers, and school inspectors&#13;
ranking both schools and teachers.&#13;
There is already a substantial system of incentive pay. The major problem with the&#13;
system is that there is no accountability of those that assign rankings. Since there are pressures&#13;
brought to bear by those who do not receive "incentive" pay, the easiest course of action for&#13;
those responsible for assigning rankings is to simply give everyone an identical (the highest)&#13;
ranking, so that all teachers receive the incentive pay. Therefore, in order not to simply replicate&#13;
the current system with a larger budget, two innovations will be introduced.&#13;
The total budget N available for incentives will be divided into three shares: t (teachers),&#13;
a (administration), and I (inspection). All schools will receive equal fractions of the teacher&#13;
budget (t*N) to be allocated among teachers according to their rankings within the school.&#13;
The teacher rankings will be a weighted average of: (a) peer rankings, (b) administration&#13;
(principal and director) rankings and (c) inspector rankings.&#13;
In order to preserve an incentive for the administration and inspectors to base rankings&#13;
on performance (unlike the current system) the administration incentive pay (a*N) will be based&#13;
on tests (or other objective) criteria for each individual school. Similarly the inspector budget&#13;
(i*N) will be divided among inspectors according to the performance of their schools. This&#13;
would be a crude way of bringing incentives to bear so that inspectors use their authority to&#13;
assign rankings in such a way as to improve teacher and school performance.&#13;
This altemative has two major advantages over compensation based strictly on test&#13;
assessed student leaming: educators nearly always (and sometimes for good reasons) oppose test&#13;
based compensation as being both too narrow and unfair, and this svstem is similar to the current&#13;
system.&#13;
The main research question is whether this will in practice be different than the uniform&#13;
allocation of group II.  One important feature of any time, "merit" or "incentive" pay in&#13;
education is the politically driven tendency towards universal and equal allocations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
A major alternative in design of this option is to force a distribution of rankings (the&#13;
fractions that receive each of, for example, five categories) and to force a mapping from rankings&#13;
to pay (the differences in bonus across ranking categories). While this would force some element&#13;
of merit based pay, it would not allow the assessment of how the rankings and pay would evolve.&#13;
V.    PARENT BASED INCENTIVE PAY&#13;
Parents are an as yet unmentioned constituency. Increased parental involvement and&#13;
control over schools is often proposed (by strikingly different groups, from economists to&#13;
anarcho-communalists) as a solution to monitoring problems. One obvious element is to give&#13;
control over incentive pay to parents, who could allocate it in any way they see fit, including&#13;
purchase of school equipment or, if they prefer it to additional pay for the existing teachers,&#13;
hiring new teachers.&#13;
In spite of its analytical interest, it is difficult to either conceive of an implementable&#13;
plan for parental control or imagine it working wel in the socio-economic and cultural context of&#13;
Egypt, or to imagine that educators (including education policy makers) would ever accept it.&#13;
In such a system, the important feature would be procedures for parental allocation which&#13;
would prevent its capture by small groups of parents. This is not impossible (it could be&#13;
accomplished for instance by specifying high quorums and super-majority voting for deviations&#13;
from some base allocation), but it would be complicated.&#13;

SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION CAPACITY AND SITE SELECTION CRITERIA&#13;
INTRODUCTION TO MOE's GENERAL AUTHORITY FOR EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS&#13;
MOE's General Authority for Educational Buildings (GAEB) began its activities on July 6, 1990,&#13;
in five Govemorates. By 1991/92 GAEB had established branch offices covering all of Egypt's 26&#13;
Govemorates (a 27th Govemorate was created in 1995 when Luxor was split off from the Qena&#13;
Govemorate), and all technical, financial and administrative staff had been appointed. During its first&#13;
five years of operation, it was GAEB's target to add 7,500 new schools to the country's educational&#13;
infrastructure, which averages out to 1,500 new schools each year.&#13;
During the period of 1992/1995, GAEB managed to add some 4,200 new schools by October&#13;
1995, and by the end of 1995 GAEB was scheduled to create a total of 4,500 new schools, thus reaching&#13;
its target implementation rate of 1,500 new schools per year located over all of Egypt. In the areas of&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance of school buildings, GAEB has carried out an extensive effort to reverse&#13;
the deteriorating conditions resulting from the preceding years of neglect. More specifically, during the&#13;
past five year GAEB has implemented the following activities:&#13;
1991/92 Rehabilitation and maintenance activities at 3,500 schools at a cost of LE 150 million.&#13;
1992/93 Rehabilitation and maintenance activities at 3,928 schools at a cost of LE 150 million;&#13;
firthermore, repair work was carried out at schools damaged in the October 1992 earthquake,&#13;
which included 7,808 schools at an additional cost of LE 247 million.&#13;
1993/94 Rehabilitation and maintenance for 3,000 schools at a cost of LE 100 million&#13;
1994/95 Rehabilitation and maintenance for 3,000 schools at a cost of LE 100 million&#13;
1995/96 Rehabilitation and maintenance for 3,000 schools at a cost of LE 100 million&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK OF MOE's GENERAL AUTHORITY FOR EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS&#13;
Set up overall planning procedures for educational buildings using GAEB's school mapping&#13;
program on a national level in order to:&#13;
* determine the school building needs in each Govemorate&#13;
* estimate the budget requirements for implementation&#13;
* define the annual program for carming out implementation.&#13;
Carry out the necessary studies to establish standards and specifications for Egypt's educational&#13;
buildings according to educational systems and curricula, taking into account differences between urban&#13;
and rural settings, as well as the physical and climatic conditions of Egypt's different geographic regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Develop different standard designs for school buildings at each level of pre-university education&#13;
by applying the standards and specifications defined under the above-described studies.&#13;
Manage the construction of educational buildings according to approved sets of plans, with&#13;
construction to be carried out by qualified companies in the private sector experienced in contracting in&#13;
accordance with all applicable legal procedures.&#13;
Manage the repair and maintenance of MOE's existing school buildings in accordance with an&#13;
approved plan, and continue with the ongoing program of bringing missing utility services to existing&#13;
schools.&#13;
Conduct training programs for GAEB's technical personnel to enable them to carry out their&#13;
responsibilities with improved efficiency.&#13;
Design equipment and furnishings as needed for MOE's different educational facilities and&#13;
manage their manufacture according to the specifications.&#13;
Establish a central data bank in order to supply decision makers with the necessaxy information,&#13;
improve communications between different GAEB departments and facilitate the exchange of&#13;
information between all participants&#13;
Create a department of intemational cooperation with the function to coordinate loan programs&#13;
between GAEB and the organizations providing the loans, both at GAEB's central and branch levels.&#13;
GENERAL SlELECTioN CRTERIiA&#13;
The basis for site selections is a "school mapping" system which, as of 1996, is limited to&#13;
existing enrollment and facility data. It does not yet include projections based upon population shifts or&#13;
other locally identified requirements. This aspect of the school mapping will be strengthened during the&#13;
project period through cooperation with the CAPMAS which is carfying out its decentennial population&#13;
census in 1996.&#13;
Sites for new schools and for extensions to existing schools will be made available by the&#13;
Govemorates to the Ministry of Education (MOE) free of charge. These sites will either be owned&#13;
outright by the govemment or will be leased to the govemment for a period of not less than 50 years.&#13;
Existing schools proposed to be rehabilitated, upgraded or replaced required a formal technical evaluation&#13;
by MOE's General Authority for Educational Buildings (GAEB) to confirm the appropriate intervention&#13;
and the extent of the intervention for rehabilitation, upgrading or replacement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

DEMAND-BASED SITE SELECTION CRITERI&#13;
The GAEB will prepare a master list of eligible school sites using its school mapping capabilities&#13;
based on the following selection criteria, and the Govemorates will choose among the eligible sites. The&#13;
final school list with supporting information from GAEB's school mapping will be submitted to the&#13;
PPMU for approval during the Annual Work Plan Review. The PPMU will disburse against completed&#13;
school buildings from the approved list subject to an audit by an independent firm.&#13;
Demand Criteria for New Schools in Rural and Urban Catchment Areas:&#13;
* Present gross enrollment rate: less than 85%&#13;
* Present classroom density: greater than 40 students per class&#13;
* Present number of shifts: more than I shift&#13;
* For new communities: current student demand to be enough to fill at least one 3-classroom school&#13;
plus kindergarten&#13;
Demand Criteria for New Schools in Rural Sites (in addition to B.1):&#13;
* Present female segment of total student enrollment: less than 45%&#13;
* Walking distance for students in catchment area not to exceed:&#13;
(I) for primary school students: 1,000 m&#13;
(ii) for preparatory school students: 2,000 m&#13;
&#149; Current student demand to be enough to fill at lease one 3-classroom school plus kindergarten&#13;
Demand Criteria for New Schools in Urban Sites (in addition to B.1):&#13;
3 Walking distance for students in catchment area not to exceed:&#13;
(I) for primary school students: 500 m&#13;
(ii) for preparatory school students: 1,500 m&#13;
* Current student demand to be enough to fill at least one 6 classroom school plus kindergarten&#13;
Demand Criteria for New 1-Classroom Schools for Girls (instead of B.1):&#13;
* Number of 8 to 14-year-old girls not currentlv in the educational svstem (catchment area less than&#13;
100 girls): up to 42 per school&#13;
* If student demand in the catchment area exceeds the maximum number for a I-classroom school (42),&#13;
an additional 1-classroom school mav need to be provided according to priorities to be determined&#13;
through an appropriate needs assessment&#13;
* Present female segment of total student enrollment: less than 40%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
TECHNICAL SITE SELECTION CRITERIA&#13;
All school sites that have passed the above-described demand analysis will also need to pass a&#13;
technical assessment carried out by GAEB on the basis of the following considerations:&#13;
*      the land area must be adequate to contain the required school building(s) and related&#13;
outside activities, and the site must be appropriate for use as a school&#13;
*      access to the site must be adequate both for the construction of the required school&#13;
building(s) and for operating the school&#13;
*      the essential infrastructure must be available (water supply, sewage and electricity)&#13;
*      a topographic survey must show that the existing site conditions do not pose&#13;
unacceptable construction or operational constraints&#13;
*      a geotechnical soil investigation must show that the site's ground conditions are suitable&#13;
for constructing the needed facility within an acceptable cost range.&#13;
GAEB's site evaluation process will take a number of additional technical criteria into&#13;
consideration relating to environmental conditions, suitability of the site to educational activities and the&#13;
site's proximity to the recommended locations earlier identified through GAEB's school mapping&#13;
program. These additional technical criteria are available in project working papers.&#13;

In the context of the ongoing collaboration between The Arab Republic of Egypt&#13;
and the World Bank in the field of educadon I would hike to reiterate for you the polEcy of&#13;
the Govenment of Egypt in regard to the delivery of basic education.&#13;
The provision of a qualitv basic education to al children holds a central place in&#13;
the development policy of the Egyptian Governiment n 1991, President Mubarak&#13;
obsavred that, "Education in Egypt continues to suffer from a predominant focus on&#13;
quantity at the expense of qualty in an attempt to provide an educational opportuy for&#13;
all cluldren. The present system of education does not help face the chlenges of the new&#13;
ea as it is bow the standard reqired.for Egypt aS a leading country. In spite ofthe fact&#13;
that educalion achausts the resourcer of the national budget and individual families, the&#13;
end-product remains poor and inadequate."&#13;
In order to address and correct the problems which the President pointed out, he&#13;
declared that the Egyptian govenument must, 'support the Ministry of Education to design&#13;
a Comprehensive plan of reform wlich is complete, radical and responsive to our&#13;
increasing needs. Our current five year plan is an knportant step towards the achient&#13;
of this goal as promoting education is our path to the new world map, the awds and basis of&#13;
our national security and our means to compete in domestic and foreign markets. We&#13;
must agree that the coming few years are the years for developing Egypt's culture and&#13;
education system  We must not understimate the human and financial resources which&#13;
will be necessary to carry out this goal."&#13;
Maor efforts have been undertaken sinc:e President Mubarak initiatad the curnt&#13;
efforts to improve Egypt's education system in 1991. In an effort to keep pace with rapid&#13;
population growth in the basic educarion age co!zcrt, enrollments ha've increased by eleven&#13;
percent Public financing for eduicatio-L which has rnsen by one third in real ermns no&#13;
claims over five percent of national income.&#13;

PRE-SERVICE TRAINING LPROVEMENT FUND&#13;
PURPOSE OF ILROVEMENT FUND&#13;
The purpose of the Fund, available to pre-service teacher training institutions on a&#13;
competitive basis, is to provide these institutions with an incentive to assess and improve the&#13;
quality of their programs (facilities, faculty, curriculum, graduation standards). To be eligible to&#13;
compete for the Fund, the institution must participate in an objective outside needs assessment,&#13;
the criteria for the assessment having been established on the basis of international standards for&#13;
pre-service training. Proposals to the Fund reflect the institutions' plans for improvement based&#13;
on these assessments. A small fund will be available to applicants to help them prepare their&#13;
proposals.&#13;
STRUCTURE OF THE CURRENT PRE-SERVICE TRAINING SYSTEM&#13;
Of the 43 pre-service institutions, 24 (56 percent) are faculties of education associated&#13;
with universities. Forty-four percent are specific education colleges. The specific education&#13;
colleges are four year post-secondary programs, but focus on specialties such as music, fine, arts,&#13;
athletics, or technology, and in twvo cases, on kindergarten and early childhood development.&#13;
The faculties of education give two types of degrees: basic, which usually restricts the&#13;
graduate to teaching at the primary level, and general, which allows the graduate to teach at the&#13;
preparatory and secondary level. They have two training systems, but all but one follow what is&#13;
called the integrated system. This program consists of four years of training in the faculty of&#13;
education, although subject matter faculty can be either members of the faculty of education or&#13;
faculty in the disciplinary departments of the university. The Institute of Graduate Education at&#13;
Cairo University follows a different model: a B.A. from a disciplinarv department and a fifth&#13;
year of training in education, especially pedagogy. Total faculty for the 24 institutions is 2755;&#13;
58 percent are Ph.D. facultv and 42 percent pre-Ph.D. faculty, the latter being in training and&#13;
holding posts such as assistant lecturer.&#13;
The MOE funds all pre-service institutions. Both the faculties of education and special&#13;
training colleges are subject to different supreme councils, which are advised by sector&#13;
committees (quitaa). The Supreme Council of Universities, which oversees the faculties of&#13;
education and reports to the Minister of Education, consists of the presidents of the universities,&#13;
5 additional members, and the minister of the MOE. It has four functions: approve the statute for&#13;
each facultv (curriculum and internal regulations); make final promotion decisions for faculty;&#13;
make degree equivalence decisions for facult applicants, high school graduates, and university&#13;
graduates; and set enrollment targets. The sector committee for the faculties of education is&#13;
known as the Deans' Council.&#13;
The MOE appoints and assigns all new teachers. Unlike universitv graduates in other&#13;
fields, who, although legally assured of a civil service job, spend years in an employment queue,&#13;
graduates of the pre-service teacher training system usually receive a job appointment&#13;
immediately upon graduation.&#13;

PROBLEMS WITH THE PRE-SERVICE TEACHER TRAINING SYSTEM&#13;
There are a number of fairly standard input problems with the pre-service training&#13;
system: low or uneven faculty quality, inadequate facilities (buildings, poorly equipped and&#13;
maintained laboratories--computer, sciences, biology, language, and micro-teaching), weak&#13;
instructional resources (libraries, textbooks, and other teaching materials and aids), and uneven&#13;
management. Like many countries, Egypt's pre-service programs seem to vary considerably in&#13;
quality. Thus, all share the fairly standard list of problems, but programs differ in the severity of&#13;
each problem.&#13;
However, these input problems are symptomatic of several basic institutional distortions.&#13;
Improving the quality of pre-service education depends on addressing these distortions in&#13;
conjunction with improving inputs. One is the lack of quality assurance mechanisms. The&#13;
Deans' Council is asked to review requests to start a new faculty of education or a new program&#13;
within an existing faculty. If the Deans' Council rejects such a request, the Supreme Council&#13;
cannot overrule that judgment. However, several deans report that in fact the Council exercises&#13;
little ex ante quality control, partly because each dean "banks" goodwill among other deans&#13;
against a time when that dean needs the committee's approval of a change in his or her program.&#13;
There is no ex post evaluative mechanism in place to review the quality of existing programs,&#13;
such as visiting or accrediting committees or independent licensing requirements for pre-service&#13;
graduates. Thus, quality controls on organizational entry into the provision of pre-service&#13;
training are weak, and there is no feedback on the quality of existing providers. The inward-&#13;
looking nature of Egypt over the last decades has also meant that even those standards that&#13;
prevail informally in the pre-service system have not been updated.&#13;
The second problem is a lack of incentives for institutions to improve the quality of their&#13;
programs.  Incentives require measures of  provider quality that do not now exist and&#13;
consequences to low or high quality which also do not exist. Institutions are funded regardless&#13;
of quality, and their graduates are hired regardless of quality.&#13;
Finally, the pre-service institutions cannot control their enrollment numbers. The&#13;
Supreme Council decides enrollment targets for the faculties of the universities each vear, as does&#13;
the version of the supreme council for the special colleges. These targets reflect estimates of&#13;
demand, but also an attempt to ensure that all high school graduates who passed the exit&#13;
examination have a place in some program in a university. Thus, the enrollment targets for pre-&#13;
service institutions can vary considerably from vear to year, making institutional planning&#13;
difficult. An extreme case of this occurred in 1995, when the high school graduating class&#13;
increased bv 60 percent because of the "double class" (adjustment to the earlier elimination of&#13;
grade 6). Relative to 1994, enrollment in the pre-service system increased 42 percent in 1995,&#13;
the faculty of education enrollments alone increasing from 20,807 in 1994 to 29,889 in 1995.&#13;
When enrollment targets are substantially increased, resources are not added to handle them.&#13;
Thus, no matter how high the quality of the program, the resources required to maintain this&#13;
quality can be overwhelmed by high enrollments.&#13;
&#13;

THE IMPROVEMENT FUND AS A SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS&#13;
If successfully implemented, the Improvement Fund will solve some, although not all, of&#13;
the problems of the pre-service system. If the Improvement Fund initiative is coordinated with&#13;
other program initiatives targeted on the system (see Annual Work Plan for Program Area 2,&#13;
Interventions 2.3.1-2.3.5), the total package will reduce both the input and institutional barriers&#13;
to quality training.&#13;
The Fund puts in place a feedback mechanism on the qualitv of pre-service institutions&#13;
and, for most of those institutions willing to use this mechanism, offers substantial resources for&#13;
program improvement. Thus, it addresses the lack of information about the quality of existing&#13;
programs, establishes international standards for assessing quality, and provides resources to&#13;
implement improvement plans that are based on outside assessments of the quality of the pre-&#13;
service institution.&#13;
Unless it becomes a permanent feature of government policy and budget, the Fund is&#13;
obviously a short-term incentive. However, the five year period can be used to observe the&#13;
responses of the pre-service system to the Fund and to a possible longer-term incentive of a&#13;
teacher licensing examination. The EEP program will fund the development, piloting, and&#13;
implementation of this examination. The results would be used to create a ranking of pre-service&#13;
institutions that is published. It is believed that this rank-order will create pressure on pre-service&#13;
institutions to improve their performance. Graduates of these institutions cannot get a teaching&#13;
job if they cannot pass the licensing examination, and schools associated with lower success rates&#13;
will be shunned. The possible problem with this theory is that the pressure on Egyptian students&#13;
to enter any post-secondary education program seems sufficiently intense to suggest that the&#13;
rank-order may simply become a way for the best students to select those institutions associated&#13;
with high pass rates. Lower quality students may be willing to take their chances with a pre-&#13;
service institution with lower pass rates if that is their only option.  Again, however, the&#13;
response of students and pre-service institutions to the results of the licensing examination can&#13;
be observed during this five year period.&#13;
ADMINISTERING THE FUND&#13;
Four steps precede the release of funds to pre-service institutions for program&#13;
improvement: (1) establishing the goals, criteria, and indicators to be used in the needs&#13;
assessments of pre-service institutions; (2) creating assessment teams; (3) creating and&#13;
administering a small fund to help applicants write multi-year quality improvement plans; and&#13;
(4) creating a judges' panel to evaluate applications to the Fund by pre-service institutions.&#13;
Establishing Criteria and Indicators for Assessing the Needs of Pre-SerWce Institutions&#13;
The PPMU will first wnte a TOR and then create a task force to conduct this activity.&#13;
The task force should be relatively small to facilitate the work--for example, six persons. Two&#13;
of the task force should be international experts, one in the design of accrediting systems and one&#13;
in international best practice in pre-service education. The foreign experts should be able to&#13;
contact other foreign experts for short-term consulting as needed. The other members should be&#13;
Egyptian. These might include a representative of the Supreme Council of Universities, a dean&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
of a faculty of education, a dean of a special college, and a dean of a universitv disciplinarv&#13;
department.&#13;
The TOR for the task force should give it some flexibility in how to conduct its work. It&#13;
may wish to observe a high quality accrediting process abroad. It mav need to commission fact-&#13;
finding reports on the current status of pre-service programs. However, in setting standards and&#13;
measures, it must anticipate the nature and quality of the pre-service programs that will be&#13;
needed to achieve Egypt's educational objectives for its students in the twenty-first century.&#13;
All deliberations and studies should be organized around producing a needs assessment&#13;
handbook that can be used by the assessment team(s). The handbook should specify criteria,&#13;
indicators, careful examples to specify the meaning of each criterion and indicator, the types of&#13;
behaviors that warrant different ratings, materials that pre-service institutions preparing for a&#13;
needs assessment must compile, and forms that the assessment team will use during its work.&#13;
Once drafted, the handbook should be circulated to the pre-service institutions for comment, to&#13;
be followed by a conference to discuss unresolved issues, areas of disagreement, and proposed&#13;
amendments.  The draft, revised after the conference, will be published, sent as a reference&#13;
handbook to all pre-service institutions, and used as the basis for training the assessment team(s).&#13;
In putting together the handbook and needs assessment process, the task force must take&#13;
a position about the confidentiality of the needs assessments of institutions. These assessments&#13;
should probably be confidential--perhaps restricted to the faculty of education itself and the&#13;
rector of that faculty's university. The point is to encourage participation in the assessment and&#13;
in a quality improvement process. It is not to embarrass any individual pre-service institution.&#13;
The task force concludes its work by: (1) setting up criteria for selecting the assessment&#13;
team(s); (2) defining the required organization of proposals to the Fund and setting the weights&#13;
for each topic to be addressed; (3) setting up rules for a small proposal development fund; and (4)&#13;
selecting one or two individuals to train the evaluation team.&#13;
Assessing Pre-Service Institutions&#13;
The PPMU will write a TOR for the assessment team(s) and select a first team. The&#13;
team must be trained in applying the handbook standards to ensure uniformity in appling the&#13;
criteria. Each needs assessment is expected to take a month of about a five person team: one&#13;
week of reading and discussing materials prepared by the pre-service institution to be assessed;&#13;
two weeks in the field at the pre-service institution, and one week to write a complete report on&#13;
the institution.&#13;
Providing Technical Assistance to Proposal Development&#13;
Faculties of education may need help in translating an assessment of their needs into an&#13;
effective improvement plan.  The PPMU  will contract technical assistance for proposal&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
Evaluating Proposals to the Fund&#13;
The PPMU will write a TOR for the team evaluating the proposals to the Fund and select&#13;
a team to judge each year's competition. The evaluation is expected to take about three weeks:&#13;
a week for all members of the judges' panel to read all applications, a week for discussing the&#13;
proposals and deciding on awards, and a week to write up the panel's assessment of the proposal&#13;
as feedback for both winning and losing applicants. If site visits to applicant institutions are&#13;
considered advisable, the evaluation process will increase three days for every site visit.&#13;
There will be no proposals in year 1 and very few in year 2. Maximum awards should be&#13;
$1 million, although the task force may wish to structure the competition into a competition for&#13;
smaller ($500,000) and larger awards ($1 million). The larger awards will be necessary if a pre-&#13;
service institution wishes to send selected faculty abroad for a year's intensive training.&#13;
Although the proposal process to the fund should be competitive, unless many more institutions&#13;
than expected apply to the Fund or certain proposals are very weak, the stress should be on trying&#13;
to fund improvement proposals to create an incentive for institutions to undergo a major needs&#13;
assessment process.&#13;

PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL LINKS&#13;
A.     ORGANIZATION OF CENTRAL AND GOVERNORATE PPMUS&#13;
This chapter describes the function and responsibilitv of the central PPMU and the&#13;
govemorate Unit (GPPMU). The organizational arrangement for coordination with&#13;
implementing agencies is also described.&#13;
The EEP is unique in the planned scale of operation and comprehensiveness of its&#13;
educational conception. The implementation of the project will entail:&#13;
* Streamlining of procedures and decision-making processes;&#13;
* Identification and assignment of specific tasks to specific agencies,&#13;
individuals, groups or institutions with clear prescription of a time-frame;&#13;
and&#13;
* Sustainability and cost effectiveness.&#13;
2.     The effective management of the multiplicity of interventions envisaged at central&#13;
and govemorate levels requires an organizational structure that combines the&#13;
following elements:&#13;
- Central level responsibility for policv guidelines and coordinated&#13;
implementation of the program;&#13;
- Govemorate level responsibility to ensure coherence and consistencv&#13;
with govemorate basic education priorities;&#13;
&#149;  Govemorate of operational responsibility to ensure responsiveness to&#13;
expressed local needs and conditions; and&#13;
-  Flexibility to adapt to unforeseen events and incorporate lessons from&#13;
experience/innovation.&#13;
3.     The overall responsibilitv for implementation of the program is vested at the&#13;
central Programming, Planning and Monitoring Unit (PPMU) which is responsible&#13;
directly to the Minister of Education. The capacity of the PPMU to implement the&#13;
program will be strengthened by assigning sections adequate financial and&#13;
administrative powers corresponding with its tasks comprising facilitation,&#13;
capacitv building, appraisal, coordination, disbursement, procurement and overall&#13;
direction of the program. Until adequate capacih building in govemorates is&#13;
achieved, the central PPMU will assist the govemorates in planning and&#13;
implementation with the approval of local authoritv. Govemorates will prepare 5-&#13;
year educational enhancement program  based on the strategic framework and&#13;
specific local conditions, identif-ing educational needs and prioritizing&#13;
interventions. Annual work plans and budgets would be prepared on the basis of&#13;
the approved 5-year program. Specific tasks would be assigned bv the central&#13;
PPMU to implementing agencies, particularly for components which require&#13;
uniformity across the country. Where these tasks require a multi-year contribution,&#13;
the implementing agencies will prepare inputs to annual work plans and budgets.&#13;
Tasks would be assigned by the PPMU for responding to requests for professional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

services arising from program planning and implementation. In organizing its&#13;
tasks of technical assistance in planning and monitoring, appraisal of projects,&#13;
supervision, program evaluation and research, consultancv and support services&#13;
would be employed for which the PPMU would be the clearing house along with&#13;

GOVERNORATE PROGRAM GUIDELINES&#13;
The goals of the Education Enhancement Program are to build institutional&#13;
capacity, reduce dropout, improve leaming, and increase access for the&#13;
underserved and children with special needs. Govemorates are required to prepare&#13;
5-year programs for participation in EEP. The long temm aim of the program is to&#13;
include all govemorates in the EEP. Govemorate participation will be sequenced&#13;
according to the following general criteria.&#13;
Selection of participating Governorates:&#13;
* Govemorate is ready and willing to participate.&#13;
* Need for EEP support to improve enrollment and inclusion of under-&#13;
served groups especially girls.&#13;
* Govemorates propose sustainable interventions which are consistent with&#13;
the EEP strategic framework.&#13;
Proposals qualifying for support under the program would be financed annually&#13;
on the basis of performance reviews, plans and budgets for the subsequent year.&#13;
The EEP seeks to achieve effective program implementation at the national and&#13;
the govemorate level by coordinating both the five years governorate program&#13;
and its annual work plan with the national program.&#13;
The govemorate plans will have two components:&#13;
* The implementation of national program components in cooperation with&#13;
implementing agencies and govemorates.&#13;
* The implementation of program activities unique to the needs of&#13;
participating govemorate.&#13;
While variations in the approach to issues and strategies for reducing dropouts,&#13;
improving leaming and increasing access are likelv to emerge across&#13;
govemorates, the EEP will emphasize the following:&#13;
* Increase community and parent participation in school management.&#13;
* Increase participation and completion of basic education by girls.&#13;
* Train teachers at the school and cluster level.&#13;
* Train for principles, supervisors and other personnel to improve school&#13;
management.&#13;
* Improve supplementaxy leaming materials for students.&#13;
* Ensure availability of leaming aids (Media and Technology).&#13;
* Improve school facilities including water supply and toilets.&#13;
* Construct of needed schools and classrooms.&#13;
* Provide of services for children with special needs.&#13;
* Provide of support to altemative education wherever necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
The programn requires participating governorates to establish a local govemorate&#13;
level PPMU which will have responsibility for planning, management and&#13;
implementation (see exhibit 3. 1).&#13;
* The EEP program will provide technical and financial support to the&#13;
participating govemorates in order to develop local capacities.&#13;
* Local level activities should include interventions which will have positive&#13;
impact on the education system and sustainability.&#13;
Financial Considerations in the Planning Process:&#13;
The limit for participating govemorates over the five-year period will be&#13;
detennined as part of the national plan. The actual amount of investment will,&#13;
however, vary from one govemorate to another depending on the assessment of&#13;
need.&#13;
EEP program funds should be additional to budget allocations for basic education.&#13;
The 5-year plan would contain a financial analysis of budget allocations and&#13;
actual expenditures on basic education for the last 3 years. These allocations must&#13;
be maintained in real terns for the time of program implementation with&#13;
additional funds provided through EEP.&#13;
Proposals will reflect the following issues:&#13;
* Promote consistency and ensure flexibility.&#13;
* Promote convergence of basic education and other activities such as&#13;
school health.&#13;
- Introduce innovations which can be replicated and expanded.&#13;

2.    The Procurement methods to be used and characteristics of the various contracts&#13;
are described below:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) (US$9.3 million)&#13;
(i)   Equipment contracts estimated to cost more than US$250,000&#13;
would be procured through ICB in accordance with IDA&#13;
Guidelines. These contracts are estimated to cost about US$9.3&#13;
million equivalent representing about 72% of all equipment items&#13;
to be procured under the project.&#13;
(b)   National Competitive Bidding (NCB) (US$96.4 million)&#13;
(i)    Civil works contracts for the construction, rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion of schools (US$96.4 million) would be small (below&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent) and geographically dispersed. Therefore,&#13;
they are unlikely to interest foreign bidders'. Procurement of these&#13;
works would therefore follow National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) using standardized bidding documents based on the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bid Documents (SBDs) for small works. NCB&#13;
procedures would be advertised widely in local papers and would&#13;
not exclude the participation of interested bidders from other&#13;
eligible countries. These procedures have been reviewed by IDA&#13;
under an ongoing project (Cr. 2476-EGT) and deemed satisfactory.&#13;
(c)   International and National Shoppinsg (US5.75 million)&#13;
(i)   Equipment and Vehicles. Contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$250,000 would be procured under International Shopping&#13;
procedures up to an aggregate of US$4.4 million. Contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 would be procured under&#13;
National Shopping procedures up to an aggregate of US$1.3&#13;
million. The main items of equipment to be procured would be&#13;
audio and video media, computers and peripherals, printing&#13;
equipement, office machines (copier, faxes). Quantities would be&#13;
decided during the Annual Reviews and synchronized with other&#13;
activities.&#13;
ICB for school building was unsuccessful in the Basic Education Project (Cr. 2476-EGT ). Two&#13;
rounds of bidding interested only one foreign bidder in the first round whose prices were three times&#13;
higher than those of the local bidders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 12&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
(d)   Other Procedures&#13;
(i)   Software and Intellectual Property contracts totaling about&#13;
US$0.16 million would be procured on terms satisfactory to ITF&#13;
following direct negotiations with property or copyright owners.&#13;
(ii)   Technical Assistance (TA) (US$4.9 million! Specialist services&#13;
would involve both consulting agencies and individual consultants.&#13;
The terms of reference for the major TA packages were reviewed&#13;
and agreed during appraisal. Others would be subject to ITF&#13;
review during project implementation.&#13;
(iii)  Procurement Restrictions The proceeds of the Interim Fund Credit&#13;
may only be withdrawn on account of expenditures for goods and&#13;
works provided by nationals of, and produced in or supplied from,&#13;
countries participating in the ITF; consequently, nationals of&#13;
countries that are not Participating Countries and bidders offering&#13;
goods and works from such countries shall be disqualified from&#13;
bidding for such contracts, and the bidding documents shall so&#13;
specify. Only consultants from Participating Countries shall be&#13;
eligible to provide services financed out the proceeds of the&#13;
Interim Fund Credit.&#13;
Contract Reviews&#13;
3.    During project supervision, the following would be subject to IDA prior review:&#13;
(a)   all goods contracts procured under ICB (above US$250,000);&#13;

4.    The above prior review processes would cover about 70 percent of all ITF-&#13;
financed goods, and about 85% of consultancy and training services. Given the large&#13;
number of repetitive contracts this is satisfactory. In addition, IDA supervision missions&#13;
would carry out selective ex-post reviews on about 1 in 10 contracts.&#13;

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
BUDGET ANALYSIS&#13;
1.     Budget Effort for Education. During the 1990s the Govemment of Egypt markedlv&#13;
increased its expenditures on education in line with the improvement in its overall&#13;
macroeconomic situation - from 12 percent of total expenditures in fiscal vear 1991 to 19 percent&#13;
in fiscal 1996. These expenditures, projected to be LE 11 billion (US$3.3 billion) in fiscal 1996,&#13;
averaged 6 percent in real annual growth over the period (Tables B1,1B2). During the same&#13;
period, total real expenditures bv the Govemment declined bv an average of 1 percent per year&#13;
(Table B21). The largest increase in education spending was directed towards an ambitious&#13;
school construction program. tripling education's share of the Govemment's total investment&#13;
budget, from 6 to 18 percent, over the six vear period. Educational investment was LE 2.2 billion&#13;
in 1996, more than twice its 1991 level.&#13;
2.      Current expenditures on education also increased - from  16 percent to 19 percent of total&#13;
govemment current and investment expenditures - chiefly due to rapid hiring of pre-university&#13;

teachers (Table 1). The teaching corps, which expanded by 25 percent over the period, grew&#13;
significantlv faster than did enrollments in pre-universitv education, which grew 18 percent over&#13;
the same period. Increased hiring of teachers was the main reason for a 46 percent increase in the&#13;
real wage bill for pre-universitv education, but was not implemented at the expense of resources&#13;
for non-wage items such as textbooks. In fact, real non-wage expenditures increased by an&#13;
impressive 56 percent over the period (Table B41). During the last several years, non-wage&#13;
expenditures have fluctuated between 18 and 20 percent of current educational expenditures&#13;

(Table B31). This is not quite so impressive as it mav seem, because low teacher salaries act to&#13;
depress the relative share of wages.&#13;
3.      Allocation to Educational Levels. Financial allocations to different levels of education&#13;
should vary according to the strength of the justification for public spending at each level. No&#13;
analvsis has been carried out on this question in Egypt, however the allocation of 71 to 73&#13;
percent of total recurrent expenditure to pre-university education in most of the reference period&#13;
is low by intemational standards (i.e., 80-86 percent for averages of low and medium-income&#13;
countries in world regions2). This overemphasis on higher education in Egypt is unlikelv to be&#13;
justified considering the country's high level of educated unemployed and the smaller degree of&#13;
market failure in higher education than at lower levels. At the tertiary level, students have&#13;
greater information about emplovment opportunities after graduation, and targeting of student&#13;
assistance to the poor is feasible. The allocation of current expenditure among the four levels of&#13;
the Egyptian education system is shown in Table 2. These budget shares indicate little about&#13;
whether an overemphasis on higher levels of education prevails; further analysis using per-&#13;
student allocations is necessary to make this determination (see below). However, over the&#13;
six-year reference period, the emphasis on primary and higher education was reversed, with&#13;
primary education increasing from 29 percent to 31 percent and higher education declining from&#13;
34 percent to 27 percent of total education spending. This constitutes a considerable shift of&#13;
resources in a relatively brief period of time.&#13;

4.      Per-Student Allocations. In 1995/96 per-student allocations for education were LE 459&#13;
(US$135) for Vrimarv, LE 624 (US$184) for preparatory and LE 928 (US$274) for secondarv&#13;
(Tables B7,B8 ). Over the fiscal years 1991-1996, unit allocations in all three levels increased&#13;
significantly in real terms, with the average primary unit allocation increasing at an average rate&#13;
of 4 percent per year, preparatory at 5 percent, and secondary at 3 percent per year.&#13;

6.       This indicates the strong budgetary effort Egypt has made   in primarv education.3&#13;
Relative to the comparator countries, Egypt did not finance primarv education at the expense of&#13;
secondary education; its ratio of secondary to primary expenditures ranked fifth highest among&#13;
the 17 countries in the group. Despite the high percentage of the budget spent on higher&#13;
education in 1990/1991 (discussed above), the relative unit cost of higher education in Egypt in&#13;
1990 - 7.5 times the unit cost of primarv education - was seventh highest among the comparator&#13;
countries, below a selection of countries mainly in Latin America and Asia but above most&#13;
African and Middle East countries on the list.&#13;
The comparator countries are a set low or middle income countries for which 1990 data exist and&#13;
which are relatively large in population or geographically in the Middle East.&#13;

FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
7.    Current Cost Implications of Program  Investments. To increase access to basic&#13;
education and improve its quality the Government plans an ambitious school construction&#13;
program within the context of the EEP. Quality improvement would be achieved through&#13;
reducing the number of schools with multiple shifts and reducing average primary and&#13;
preparatory class sizes from 47 and 44 students respectively, to forty. The largest share of&#13;
recurrent costs implied by program investments will be for maintenance, staffing and supplies in&#13;
new schools. All of the new school facilities (approximately 11,900 additional classrooms per&#13;
year, excluding replacement classrooms) will require current budget allocations for maintenance.&#13;
Without rationalization of the use of teachers, which in tum would require comprehensive civil&#13;
service reform, 8,600 classrooms per year (excluding those replacing multiple shift schools), will&#13;
need to be staffed with teachers. This will add additional salary expense to the budget if teachers&#13;
are added according to current staffing pattems. The 6,000 classrooms constructed to increase&#13;
access will have also to be supplied with learning materials for the new students.&#13;
8.    The EEP components for improved teaching and learning and capacity building also&#13;
imply greater Govenmment spending at the central level, and in Governorates participating in the&#13;
project, on building and equipment maintenance, equipment replacement, and on goods and&#13;
services. An analysis of the sustainability of these various additional expenditures within the&#13;
expected overall macroeconomic and budget context, and without donor assistance beyond the&#13;
five-vear time frame of the EEP, is therefore necessary.&#13;
9.    Macroeconomic Context. The size and growth of the overall govemment budget, and&#13;
of the education budget, will be influenced in the future by general economic performance, as&#13;
well as by particular policy decisions. A 1995 World Bank forecast analyzed the medium and&#13;
long-term  impact of a reinforced economic reform  agenda which centers on maintaining&#13;
macroeconomic discipline, improving the conditions for private sector growth, reducing the size&#13;
of the govemment sector and liberalizing the intemational trade regime. The forecast projects&#13;
growth of GDP and govemment expenditures (Table 4). Under the no change scenario, growth&#13;
in government spending for current and fixed investment was projected to lie in the range of 0.2&#13;
to 1.8 percent during the 1995-2012 period. Under the reform scenario, growth in spending was&#13;
forecast to be larger, but stiUl under 4.5 percent in all vears.&#13;

10.    Sustainability Analysis. This analysis shows that the current expenditures implied by&#13;
the EEP would be easily sustainable within the likely macroeconomic and budgetary context&#13;
indicated above. In 2002, the year following completion of the first phase of the EEP, additional&#13;
expenditures implied by this first phase would be less than 1 percent of both total and pre-&#13;
university educational expenditures, assuming real growth in these of zero to five percent per&#13;
year during the project period (Table 4). In 2011, the implied expenditures would still be only 2&#13;
to 4 percent of total education expenditures and 3 to 6 percent of pre-university expenditures, on&#13;
the assumption that the real annual growth rates on these expenditures would be 0 to 5 percent&#13;
over the period 1997-2011 (Table B91). At this level, the implied recurrent costs due to EEP&#13;
investments would be easily financed by the Govemnment with minimal adjustment to its overall&#13;
expenditure program. This conclusion is not very sensitive to assumptions on budgetary growth&#13;
or decline outside the expected range. For instance, an unlikelv cumulative real budgetary&#13;
decline of 3 percent per vear during the 15-vear period would increase the implied incremental&#13;
expenditures to only 6 percent of education expenditures.&#13;

COST ANALYSIS OF INTERVENTIONS&#13;
11.   Analysis of the cost effectiveness of project interventions on student learning was not&#13;
possible with available data. However, analysis of least-cost altematives in school construction&#13;
and teacher training did yield some conclusions.&#13;
12.   First, the Government has selected new  school designs for future primary and&#13;
preparatory school construction based on proposals suggested by a World Bank architectural&#13;
consultant. The new designs result in a more effective layout of classrooms and circulation in a&#13;
smaller area. Based on World Bank and Ministry of Education projections, this will result in&#13;
cost savings of approximately US$40 million per year (total annual savings to the construction&#13;
program due to IDA proposals, including those to reduce the number of schools to be built,&#13;
would be about $70 million).&#13;
13.    Second, the Government chose to invest in what appears to be the more cost-effective of&#13;
two teacher training options. The choice was between (a) reforming the current cascade training&#13;
system, which is now performing at a very low level of effectiveness, and (b) implementing&#13;
training based on distance leaming. Little data exist to provide cost figures for either option in&#13;
Egypt, but evidence from Sri Lanka - where a 1991 USAID-financed study4 provides some&#13;
relevant intemational evidence. The study concluded that teacher training based on distance&#13;
learning techniques was more cost effective than the traditional in-service training programs&#13;
provided by teachers' colleges. Using a composite index to measure improvement in trainees'&#13;
knowledge and skills in mathematics and language, the study found that the cost of the distance-&#13;
learning program per unit improvement in knowledge and skills was only one-third of the cost of&#13;
the traditional program.&#13;

            The Education Enhancement Program
            Project (EEP) objectives are to enhance the Ministry's
            ability to achieve its major long term goals outlined above.
            This project will be the first of a series designed to
            increase gender equity, improve instructional quality and
            increase sectoral efficiency.  The Government has developed
            a long-term strategic framework defining the EEP consisting
            of thirteen objectives for basic education and the
            interventions the Government will employ to achieve these
            objectives. The project will assist the Government with the
            following components: a) improve coverage and equity of
            access in basic education; b) improve the quality of student
            performance in basic education; and c) improve system efficiency.
