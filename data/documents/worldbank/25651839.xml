Indonesia has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past 15 years. The national&#13;
poverty rate was halved, from 24 percent in 1999 to 11.3 percent in 2014. Growth averaged at 6&#13;
percent annually for a decade up until 2015. Internationally, Indonesia also joined the G-20 as&#13;
Southeast Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s only representative.&#13;
&#13;
But the quest for widely shared prosperity is not over. Indonesia is at risk of leaving its poor&#13;
and vulnerable behind. Poverty reduction has begun to stagnate, with a near zero decline&#13;
in 2014. Income inequality is rapidly rising and up to one third of it is explained by inequal-&#13;
ity of opportunities. Healthy and well educated children live side by side with children&#13;
who suffer from malnutrition, learn little when they are in school, and drop out too early.&#13;
And there are stark inequalities between regions; for example, 6 percent of children in Jakar-&#13;
ta do not have access to proper sanitation while, at the same time, 98 percent of children in&#13;
rural Papua have no access. This kind of inequality dims the prospects of important segments&#13;
of society for generations.&#13;
&#13;
The Government of Indonesia has rightly identified inequality as an obstacle to sustainable&#13;
development and has set targets to reduce it. In support of this public policy objective, the&#13;
World Bank embarked on research to better understand why inequality is rising in Indonesia,&#13;
why it matters, and what can be done about it. This work is the result of partnerships between&#13;
many government agencies and The World Bank. The study enjoyed the financial support&#13;
from the Australian Department of Foreign A airs and Trade.&#13;
&#13;
Inequality is complex, impacting many facets of life and involving many actors. We hope that&#13;
this report will encourage public policy based on evidence and informed by experiences from&#13;
countries that have successfully reduced inequality.&#13;
&#13;
In the country Indonesians deserve and want, extreme poverty is eliminated. In the Indonesia&#13;
its people dream of, the poor and vulnerable have more opportunities to enjoy â&#128;&#152;shared pros-&#13;
perityâ&#128;&#153;. This is not an agenda of redistributing an economy of a ï¬&#129;xed size. Indonesians need to&#13;
expand the size of the pie, and keep expanding it and sharing it, to ensure that the welfare of&#13;
all, and especially the most vulnerable, rises as quickly as possible.&#13;
&#13;
The task of slowing â&#128;&#147; or even reversing â&#128;&#147; the trend of rising inequality is a large challenge, and&#13;
one that will take time to achieve. But we believe that by standing together â&#128;&#147; the government,&#13;
alongside civil society and the private sector, with the support of development partners â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
country will be able to make a di erence for current and future generations who deserve a fair&#13;
opportunity for a better life.&#13;
&#13;
We at the World Bank Group stand ready to continue supporting these objectives.&#13;

  Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rising&#13;
  Rising inequality is creating an Indonesia&#13;
  that is more divided than ever before . Fifteen&#13;
  years of sustained economic growth in Indonesia have&#13;
  helped to reduce poverty and create a growing middle&#13;
                                                                 Ur gent acti on i s needed, not on ly b e cause&#13;
                                                                 i nequali ty i s often unfai r, b u t a l s o&#13;
                                                                 b ecause i t may lead to slower g r ow t h a nd&#13;
                                                                 poverty red u cti on, and an i ncre a se d risk&#13;
  class. However, growth over the past decade has primarily      of confli ct. A certain degree of inequality can be&#13;
  benefitted the richest 20 percent and left the remaining       positive, by rewarding those who work hard, innovate&#13;
  80 percent of the populationâ&#128;&#148;about 205 million peopleâ&#128;&#148;         and take risks. But income inequality is unfair when not&#13;
  behind. With rising disparities in living conditions and an    everyone has the same initial opportunities in life. The&#13;
  increased concentration of wealth in the hands of the          consequences of doing nothing and allowing inequality&#13;
  few, Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s level of inequality is now considered to      to grow unchecked could be serious, giving rise to slower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
equality&#13;
  be relatively high and climbing faster than most of its East   economic growth and poverty reduction, and increasing&#13;
  Asian neighbors.                                               the risk of conflict. Most Indonesians are now aware of the&#13;
                                                                 issue and believe that the Government should take action.&#13;
&amp;#12;3&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  OVERVIEW                                     4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                Allowing inequality to grow unchecked could&#13;
                give rise to slower economic growth and poverty&#13;
                reduction, and increase the risk of conï¬&#130;ict.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                THERE ARE FOUR MAIN DRIVERS OF INEQUALITY IN INDONESIA THAT AFFECT BOTH CURRENT AND&#13;
                FUTURE GENERATIONS. Taking action requires a better understanding of why inequality is rising. So in partnership&#13;
                with the Government of Indonesia and supported by the Australian Department of Foreign A airs and Trade, the World&#13;
                Bank conducted a research project that explored this question and identiï¬&#129;ed four main causes.&#13;
&#13;
               Inequality&#13;
           of opportunity      Poorer children often have an unfair start in life, undermining their ability to succeed later. At least one-&#13;
                               third of inequality is due to factors outside an individualâ&#128;&#153;s control.&#13;
                 Unequal&#13;
                    jobs       The labor market is divided between high-skilled workers who receive increasing wages, and the rest&#13;
                               of the workforce that does not have the opportunity to develop these skills and is trapped in low-&#13;
                               productivity, informal, and low-wage jobs.&#13;

                               households, eroding their ability to earn incomes and invest in the health and education needed to climb&#13;
                               up the economic ladder.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                PUBLIC POLICIES CAN HELP INDONESIA TO BREAK THE INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF INEQUALITY.&#13;
                High inequality is not inevitable; policymakers can reduce inequality by tackling those factors exacerbating inequality&#13;
                that lie outside an individualâ&#128;&#153;s control. The World Bank recommends four key actions:&#13;
&#13;
          Improving local&#13;
          service delivery     A key to a better start for the next generation lies in enhanced local service delivery, which can improve&#13;
                               health, education and family planning opportunities for all.&#13;
&#13;
    Promoting better jobs&#13;
       and skills training     Skills training programs can improve the competitiveness of workers who have missed out on a&#13;
     opportunities for the     quality education. Also, the Government can help to create better jobs through greater investment in&#13;
               workforce       infrastructure, a more conducive investment climate and a less rigid regulatory approach.&#13;
&#13;
     Ensuring protection&#13;
            from shocks        Government policies can reduce the frequency and severity of shocks, as well as provide coping&#13;
                               mechanisms to ensure that all households have access to adequate protection when shocks do occur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Using taxes and&#13;
  government spending to       Speciï¬&#129;c ï¬&#129;scal policies could focus on increasing spending on infrastructure, health and education,&#13;
reduce inequality now and      social assistance and social insurance. Such improved public spending could also be supported by&#13;
             in the future     a fairer taxation system designed to address some of the current tax regulations that encourage the&#13;
                               concentration of wealth.&#13;

                              by many other types of inequality in Indonesia.        fortunate few Indonesians have access to financial&#13;
                              People are divided into haves and have-nots from       and physical assets (such as land and property)&#13;
                              before birth. Some children are born healthy and       that increase their wealth over time. This wealth&#13;
                              grow up well in their early years; many do not.        is passed down from generation to generation,&#13;

                              education; many do not. This means that some           and through greater access to better health and&#13;
                              young adults enter the workforce with the right        education. As a result, inequalities are being&#13;

                            Inequality is also inï¬&#130;uenced by how this income is                      wage jobs. Together these factors mean that&#13;

            Indonesia's rising divide : why
            inequality is rising, why it matters and what can be done
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Rising inequality is creating an
            Indonesia that is more divided than ever before. Fifteen
            years of sustained economic growth in Indonesia have helped
            to reduce poverty and create a growing middle class.
            However, growth over the past decade has primarily
            benefitted the richest 20 percent and left the remaining 80
            percent of the population-about 205 million people - behind.
            With rising disparities in living conditions and an
            increased concentration of wealth in the hands of the few,
            Indonesia's level of inequality is now considered to be
            relatively high and climbing faster than most of its East
            Asian neighbors. Urgent action is needed, not only because
            inequality is often unfair, but also because it may lead to
            slower growth and poverty reduction, and an increased risk
            of conflict. A certain degree of inequality can be positive,
            by rewarding those who work hard, innovate and take risks.
            But income inequality is unfair when not everyone has the
            same initial opportunities in life. The consequences of
            doing nothing and allowing inequality to grow unchecked
            could be serious, giving rise to slower economic growth and
            poverty reduction, and increasing the risk of conflict. Most
            Indonesians are now aware of the issue and believe that the
            Government should take action.
