Abstract&#13;
Agricultural production and trade data recently released from&#13;
China are the basis of tlhis assessment of per capita nutrient availability&#13;
in China over time and by province. This large body of data has been&#13;
compiled into national level food balance sheets for the period 1950-81&#13;
and provincial nutrient production figures for 1979-80.  Despite limited&#13;
knowledge of production, trade, utilization and nutrient composition for&#13;
some foods for some yearls, the food balance sheets present a comprehensive&#13;
picture of nutrient availability for each year and of trends in nutrient&#13;
availability over time and by province.&#13;
National average daily per capita energy, protein, and fat&#13;
availability grew rapidly during the 1950s and marginally exceeded require-&#13;
ments by 1958. The sharlp setback of the agricultural sector during the&#13;
years 1959-64, however, depressed nutrient availability far below require-&#13;
ments in those years. Nuatrient availability steadily recovered from the&#13;
low in 1960 and during the last five years has surpassed requirements by a&#13;
significant margin. Per capita availability of fine grains, vegsetable oils,&#13;
animal products and other preferred commodities have also increased since&#13;
1978. China sepms likely to be able to maintain present favorable levels of&#13;
per capita nutrient avai:Lability during the 1980s. Per capita average nutrient&#13;
availability differs greatly by province. Several Northwestern and Southwestern&#13;
provinces were below national average nutrient availability levels in 1979-80.&#13;
Special efforts will be :required to improve agricultural product:ivity and&#13;
nutritional status in these areas during the 1980s.&#13;

Acknowledgements&#13;
This report has benefitted from the contributions&#13;
of a number of World Bank staff members. Rae Nickell&#13;
carefully prepared the food conversion rates, did most of&#13;
the work on the nutrient requirements section, and otherwise&#13;
took part in the compilation of the food balance sheets.&#13;
Jim Goering and Dean Jamison first proposed the idea of&#13;
compiling a food balance sheet time series for China, and&#13;
they have reviewed and commented upon the work throughout&#13;
its progression. The author would also like to acknowledge&#13;
the kind assistance of Alan Berg, Lucy Cindoyan, Timothy&#13;
King, Joanne Leslie, Kyle Peters, Ian Porter, Peter Ting,&#13;
and Tom Wiens. Several scholars outside of the World Bank&#13;
have also made important contributions to the report. Charlie&#13;
Liu and Frederic Surls of the USDA, Bruce Stone of the IFPRI,&#13;
and John Aird and Judith Bannister of the US Census Bureau&#13;
were all very generous with their tidte and their knowledge&#13;
of China.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
i.        The most direct means of assessing a nation's ability to feed its&#13;
people is through the compilation of food balance sheets. This study&#13;
presents the results of a time series of yearly food balance sheets for&#13;
China for the period 1950-81. The food balance sheets model the production,&#13;
trade, and utilization of food and estimate the levels and sources of net&#13;
energy, protein, and fal: available in the average Chinese diet., The food&#13;
balance sheets calculate only national average nutrient availability,&#13;
however, and may be misLeading indicators of actual nutritional status for&#13;
some segments of the society. Disparities in food availability across&#13;
locality are examined through the compilation of per capita provincial grain&#13;
production figures over time and per capita provincial nutrient: availability&#13;
in 1979 and 1980.&#13;
ii.       The substantial increase in the flow of information from China&#13;
during the last several years has facilitated the compilation of the food&#13;
balance sheet time series. Despite inadequate knowledge of production,&#13;
trade, utilization and nutrient composition for some commodities for some&#13;
years, the food balance sheets are believed to present reasonably accurate&#13;
nutrient availability figures for each year 1950-81 and a more accurate&#13;
picture of trends in nutrient availability over time. The provincial data&#13;
assess disparity in nutrient availability by province for recent years and&#13;
outline provincial trends in food production over time. Together these&#13;
national and provincial level data present generally favorable trends in&#13;
nutrient availability in China.&#13;
iii.      Per capita nul:rient availability in 1981 greatly exce!eded the 1950&#13;
level, though this improvement has not been stable over time. Average daily&#13;
per capita nutrient availability grew rapidly after 1949 and by 1958 roughly&#13;
equaled requirements. The subsequent sharp decline of agricultural&#13;
production with the Great Leap Forward (1959), however, resulted in a sudden&#13;
fall of per capita nutrient availability to below the 1950 level.    The food&#13;
crisis of 1959-64 involved a great deal of human suffering. It: is likely&#13;
that total population declined during part of that period. By the mid-1970s&#13;
per capita nutrient availability had recovered to the levels achieved in&#13;
1958. In the last five years, average per capita nutrient availability has&#13;
surpassed requirements by a significant margin due to increased agricultural&#13;
production and record grain imports.&#13;
iv.       The percentage shares of energy, protein, and fat availability&#13;
coming from crop production and from grains have been remarkably steady over&#13;
time.  Per capita availability of individual commodities has, however,&#13;
changed significantly. Per capita availability of preferred commodities&#13;
increased during the 1950s. With the sharp fall in agricultural production&#13;
at the end of the 1950s, however, per capita production of preferred&#13;
commodities declined. Since 1978, the increase in preferred commodities'&#13;
share of total production has resumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v.        China's agriculture has now achieved a level of production where&#13;
national average per capita nutrient supply exceeds requirements by a&#13;
significant margin. It is quite likely, moreover, that per capita nutrient&#13;
supply will be maintained at least at the current levels. Even pessimistic&#13;
projections for China's agricultural output suggest per annum growth rates&#13;
that are above the current population growth rate, indicating continued&#13;
growth in per capita nutrient availability. The ability to produce above the&#13;
levels set by minimum food requirements suggests some changing priorities for&#13;
China's agriculture during the 1980s.&#13;
vi.       Continued growth in per capita food production remains imperative&#13;
to further improvements in nutritional status and economic progress in China&#13;
during the 1980s. Improving the infrastructure and technology for the&#13;
handling of food after harvest will become increasingly important. Expansion&#13;
of marketing infrastructure would improve the diversity and stability of food&#13;
supplies available to consumers. With the increase in land area under&#13;
private production and the limited acceptance of free trade markets, the&#13;
transportation and market systems for such trade have been found inadequate.&#13;
China is also currently interested in upgrading and extending capacity for&#13;
food fortification. Fortification of foods with vitamitiD or iron, for&#13;
example, would be useful given the incidence of vitamin D and iron deficiency&#13;
in China. The post-harvest handling of food (transportation, processing and&#13;
fortification, marketing, and storage) is potentially a profitable&#13;
labor-intensive industry amenable to international assistance.&#13;
vii.      Per capita nutrient availabilty differs greatly by province.&#13;
Provincial nutrient availability was below average nutrient requirements in&#13;
10 of China's 29 provinces in both 1979 and 1980 despite the fact that&#13;
national average nutrient availability was well above requirements in those&#13;
years. Between 10 and 15% of China's population lived in provinces where&#13;
average nutrient availability fell below 90% of average nutrient requirements&#13;
in 1979-80. The shortfalls in nutrient availability are concentrated in&#13;
several Northwestern and Southwestern provinces. Trends in per capita&#13;
provincial grain production suggest that the provinces below the national&#13;
avergae have changed over time. Per capita production has suffered a&#13;
relative decline in Sichuan and Yunnan while per capita production in Hebei,&#13;
Liaoning, Shandong and Jiangsu has increased since the 1950s.&#13;
viii.     The current situation dictates that further improvements in&#13;
nutritional status will increasingly depend upon more egalitarian distri-&#13;
bution of available food. Though China has an admirable record of egalita-&#13;
rian food distribution, there still appears to be significant disparity of&#13;
nutrient availability by province and at the local and household levels.&#13;
Though provincial nutrient availability figures are only rough approximations,&#13;
a very large and nutritionally significant disparity is discernable between&#13;
provinces with above and below average nutrient availability. The nutrient&#13;
shortfall (expressed in wheat equivalent) of those provinces producing below&#13;
average nutrient requirements represents less than three percent of China's&#13;
total grain production. At issue, however, is the more difficult problem of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
increasing agricultural production and income in the poorer Northwestern and&#13;
Southwestern provinces. Improving production and nutrition in these areas&#13;
will.require special attention.&#13;
ix.       The production responsibility systems introduced in recent years&#13;
may have caused the emergence of disparities in access to food supplies at&#13;
the local and household levels.  The emphasis    on "linking remuneration&#13;
with output" (i.e., equating income with output) may     further exacerbate&#13;
the conditions of brigades and teams handicapped by their physical&#13;
environment. Such groups may have previously benefitted from pooling their&#13;
income with larger groups. Implementation of the agricultural&#13;
responsibility system, furthermore, may have put households wit:h few able&#13;
bodied workers at a disadvantage. With these changes, and their impact on&#13;
China-s rural social welfare system, nutrition of these low income families&#13;
may be adversely affected.&#13;
x.        Achievement of a per capita level of nutrient availability which&#13;
exceeds requirements does not translate directly into adequate or even&#13;
improved nutritional status for all segments of the population. Although&#13;
China has tried, apparently quite successfully, to prevent food supplies in&#13;
poor or climatically-affected areas from falling below the minimum needed&#13;
for reasonably healthy subsistence, there are significant disparities among&#13;
locations in nutrient a-vailability. These disparities in local food supplies&#13;
may cause a significant amount of malnutrition in China. Thus)although&#13;
there has been remarkable progress in recent years in raising average per&#13;
capita nutrient availability, much remains to be accomplished.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
1. METHODOLOGY&#13;
1.01      The substantial increase in the flow of information from China&#13;
during the last several years has facilitated the compilation of a food&#13;
balance sheet time series with a greater degree of accuracy thani was&#13;
previously possible. Nevertheless, the accuracy and availability of infor-&#13;
mation regarding China's food system differ widely by commodity and by year.&#13;
Compilation of the food balance sheets has necessarily relied upon certain&#13;
assumptions regarding food production, trade, utilization, and nutrient&#13;
composition. The data sources, models, and assumptions used to compile the&#13;
food balance sheets are detailed in Annex 2.    Agricultural production and&#13;
trade, and national popu:Lation time series are presented in Annex 3. A brief&#13;
summary of these data resources and methodology is presented in this section.&#13;
1.02.     The food balance sheets model China-s production, international&#13;
trade, and utilization of food (Annex 1). The 21 commodities included, rows&#13;
1-21 of the food balance sheets, are comprehensive in terms of the&#13;
nutritionally important items in the Chinese diet. Production, trade, end&#13;
uses, and nutrient availabilities for the 21 commodities are presented in&#13;
columns I-X of the food balance sheets. Domestic supply of the commodities&#13;
(unprocessed) (column IV) are derived from agricultural production figures/l&#13;
net of trade. There are no data available for foodgrain reserves, so&#13;
changes in stocks are assumed to be negligible in the study. Seed, feed,&#13;
and nonfood manufacturing requirements, dehusking, milling, crushing, other&#13;
processing losses, and waste are then deducted from domestic supply to&#13;
determine net food available for human consumption (column VI). The yearly&#13;
net food availability figures are then converted to per capita daily&#13;
nutrient availabilities (energy, protein, and fat) according to the mid-year&#13;
population, the number of days per year, and the nutrient composition of the&#13;
commodity.&#13;
1.03      Agricultural production data have been drawn from Chinese sources&#13;
as far as possible. Population figures are from the World Bank's demographic&#13;
nodel of China, which is also closely tied to official Chinese figures.&#13;
(Midyear population figures for 1950-81 are presented in Table 9 of Annex 3).&#13;
Foreign data have played a subsidiary role in the substantiation of the&#13;
Thinese production data and in providing selected year production data for&#13;
ninor commodities.   Trade, processing and utilization, and nutrient composi-&#13;
tion data rely upon foreign sources because of the absence of Ch:Lnese sources.&#13;
The food balance sheets exclude Taiwan.&#13;
/1 Agricultural production data are harvest figures (i.e., net harvest&#13;
after crop losses during the growing season and harvest).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
1.04      All data and models used to compile the food balance sheets have&#13;
been retained on computer files. With these computer models, the food&#13;
balance sheets are easily revised to accommodate new data and/or changes in&#13;
the underlying assumptions. In particular, the impact upon per capita&#13;
nutrient availability of different values for population, foodcrop&#13;
production, feedgrain consumption, and other variables is readily&#13;
determined.&#13;
A. Production Data&#13;
1.05      Complete time series are only available for China's production of&#13;
total grains, rice, wheat, and aquatic products./l Selected year data are&#13;
available for production of all other commodities except pulses, vegetables,&#13;
poultry, other meat, eggs, and animal fat.&#13;
1.06      Although these production data appear to be reasonably accurate and&#13;
consistent, one must remain generally cautious with their use. Understatement&#13;
of production is typical of most newly developed agricultural reporting&#13;
systems such as China-s./2 In China, these likely technical difficulties may&#13;
have been of secondary importance relative to political pressures in the&#13;
collection and reporting of statistical information. China's statistical&#13;
system fell into considerable disarray during the Great Leap Forward (1959&#13;
and following years). Production data currently reported for those several&#13;
years are in part based upon more recently conducted "multiyear recall"&#13;
surveys.&#13;
/1 The primary reference for production data is the 1980 Chinese Agricul-&#13;
tural Yearbook (Beijing, Agricultural Publishing House, 1981). Ten&#13;
Great Years (Beijing, Foreign Language Press, 1960) supplies some addi-&#13;
tional production data for the 1950s. Finally, China: Country Economic&#13;
Memorandum (Washington, World Bank, 1982) and China: Review of Agricul-&#13;
ture in 1981 and Outlook for 1982 (Washington, USDA Economic Research&#13;
Service, 1982) (and previous issues of this USDA supplement) have pro-&#13;
vided some other selected year production figures.&#13;
Bruce Stone of the IFPRI has reviewed the currently available agricultural&#13;
production data in "The Use of Agricultural Statistics," Appendix A of&#13;
Barker, et al. eds. The Chinese Agricultural Economy, (Colorado, Westview&#13;
Press, Inc., 1982) pp. 205-245.   Also see Fred Surls' brief summary in&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.07      The Chinese Government has reported production data for grains&#13;
other than rice and wheait for only 9 of the 32 years under study. The&#13;
residual "other grains" 'row 9) is derived as the difference bet:ween total&#13;
grains /1 and all other grains for which production data were available for&#13;
that year. For the yearz; with an incomplete disaggregation of grain&#13;
production data, the other grains composite residual is the total of all&#13;
coarse grains, tubers, soybeans, and other minor grains. For the nine years&#13;
with a complete disaggregation of grain production, the other grains&#13;
residual includes only ot:her minor grains (i.e., the residual estimates&#13;
barley, oats, and other minor grains).&#13;
1.08      There are no national figures for production of pulses,&#13;
vegetables, and eggs. For the nine years with a complete breakdown of grain&#13;
production, pulse product:ion has been estimated as a residual of the total&#13;
grain production figures for those years. The procedure relies on the USDA&#13;
time series for China's production of oats and barley and should be&#13;
considered as a rough estimate. Vegetable production data are based upon&#13;
the available selected year vegetable acreage data and assumed yields. The&#13;
1957 yield is assumed to have been 20 tons per hectare and to have been&#13;
increasing at 2% p.a. The resulting vegetable production figures must be&#13;
regarded as only very rough estimates. Egg production figures have been&#13;
estimated from per capita. consumption figures reported for recent years.&#13;
1.09      Production of red meat (pork, beef, and mutton), poultry, other&#13;
meat, and animal fat was estimated using assumed liveweights, slaughter rates,&#13;
dressing weights and time series of animal populations and yearly slaughter of&#13;
swine in accordance with selected year production data. Production figures&#13;
for edible oil and sugar have been estimated using assumed crush and extrac-&#13;
tion rates and time series for oilseed, sugar cane and sugar beet production&#13;
in accordance with selected year production data. Underlying coefficients and&#13;
models are fully specified in Annex 2. The models and coefficients reflect&#13;
information available in late 1982 and are generally incomplete in the case of&#13;
poultry, other meat, and animal fat. Production data for the nutritionally&#13;
more important commodities (i.e., red meat and edible oil) are believed to be&#13;
reasonably accurate for most years.&#13;
/1 The State Statistical Bureau defines total grains as the sum of rice,&#13;
wheat, coarse grains (corn, sorghum, millet, and pulses), tubers con-&#13;
verted to dry weight, soybeans, and other minor grains (e.g. barley and&#13;
oats).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
B. Trade Data&#13;
1.10      Agricultural trade data for China for the period 1950-81 are&#13;
available in the FAO Trade Yearbook and other sources./l Imports and&#13;
exports to China for all reporting countries are summed to derive estimates&#13;
of China's yearly trade. Trade with nonreporting countries (most notably&#13;
other communist countries of Asia during the 1950s) is not included and,&#13;
therefore, the total trade figures understate actual trade to a minor&#13;
extent. The FAO Trade Yearbooks' figures for China's agricultural trade in&#13;
the 1970s include Taiwan. As Taiwan's production and trade figures have&#13;
been excluded from all other segments of the food balance sheets in this&#13;
exercise, Taiwan's trade figures have also been subtracted from FAO's trade&#13;
figures for China for the 1970s. Rice trade figures have been converted to&#13;
their paddy rice equivalents in the food balance sheets and trade in flour&#13;
and other processed commodities has been expressed in their unprocessed&#13;
equivalents.&#13;
C. Processing and Utilization Data&#13;
1.11      Part of China's domestic food supply is diverted from human&#13;
consumption during transportation, storage, processing and through&#13;
alternative end uses./2 These losses and alternative end-use requirements are&#13;
summed and entered as column V of the food balance sheets. Knowledge of the&#13;
magnitude of food disappearance due to waste and through alternative end&#13;
uses is incomplete and represents a weak element in the composition of food&#13;
balance sheets. Disappearance through waste, manufacturing, seed and feed&#13;
grain requirements, etc., have been approximated using available information&#13;
and in conjunction with the relevant biological and manufacturing limits.&#13;
The impact of different assumptions regarding food disappearance upon&#13;
nutrient availability is discussed in Section 2 E below.&#13;
/1 FAO trade data for China for the period 1950-69 have been summarized in&#13;
the USDA's Agricultural Trade of the PRC, 1935-69 (Washington, Economic&#13;
Research Service, 1972), pp. 26-39. For other years, the FAO Trade&#13;
Yearbook (Rome, FAO), USDA, China: Review of Agriculture in 1981 and&#13;
Outlook for 1982, op. cit., and World Bank, China: Country Economic&#13;
Memorandum, op. cit., have been relied upon for trade data.&#13;
/2 Roughly 30% of domestic food supply is diverted from direct human&#13;
consumption. Much of this loss, however, represents inedible portions&#13;
of domestic food supply (e.g., about 40% of this loss is in the form of&#13;
rice husk).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
1.12      Dehusking paddy rice and the milling of other grains is quantita-&#13;
tively the most significant form of such food disappearance./l Extraction&#13;
rates reported in China: Rural Processing Technology /2 are somewhat below&#13;
those reported to the World Bank economic mission to China (1980). A rice&#13;
extraction coefficient of 67% has been adopted in light of the antiquated&#13;
inefficient rice processing equipment generally in use in China.&#13;
1.13      Grain for use in animal husbandry in China is estimated to account&#13;
for 7 to 11% of total grain output. Results of a feeding regimen model&#13;
similar to that used by Dawson /3 suggest that roughly 12% of China's total&#13;
unprocessed grain production is used as feed grain (roughly 22% when&#13;
including grain millings and oilseed cake). These figures are used in the&#13;
food balance sheets and may overstate the true amount of grain used in&#13;
animal husbandry by several million metric tons. Little is known as to&#13;
which of the grains produced in China are used as feed grains.&#13;
1.14      Seed requirements have been estimated from data reported by the&#13;
World Bank Staff Appraisal Reports for the North China Plain Agricultural and&#13;
Hebei Agricultural Development Projects and from other references. The 3%&#13;
figure for waste which is used in the FAO provisional food balance sheets&#13;
has been adopted in this study for most commodities. Coefficients for the&#13;
share of domestic food supply used for nonfood manufacturing end uses (e.g.&#13;
soap, candles, starch) have been taken from the FAO provisional food balance&#13;
sheets for China. Due to inadequate information, food manufacturing end&#13;
uses such as alcoholic beverage and tofu (soybean curd) production have not&#13;
been reported in the food balance sheets. This implicitly assumes that the&#13;
net nutrient loss from such food manufacturing is negligible relative to&#13;
total nutrient availability.&#13;
1.15      Total domestic food supplies are converted to their per capita&#13;
equivalents by dividing by mid-year population as estimated by the World&#13;
Bank's demographic model. Though foreign estimates of China population are&#13;
now converging, it is generally accepted that the figures released by the&#13;
Chinese Government may be undercounts of the true population. The World&#13;
Bank's demographic model is developed from China's official demographic data&#13;
/1 Over 50% of this disappearance, however, is in the form of rice husk.&#13;
As rice husk is not edible, it is inaccurate to consider this food&#13;
disappearance. Dehusking paddy rice generally involves some loss of the&#13;
rice bran, however, especially with more antiquated rice husking&#13;
technology. The milling of wheat and other grains also results in a&#13;
loss of nutrient value.&#13;

using internally consistent birth and death rates. China's official figures&#13;
for 1982 are based upon household registration and may omit citizens existing&#13;
outside of the household registration system and thereby possibly understate&#13;
total population by as much as 5 or 6%.&#13;
D. Nutrient Composition&#13;
1.16      The per capita food availabilities presented in column VII of the&#13;
food balance sheets are converted to their nutrient equivalents using the&#13;
food conversion rates shown in Table 2.1. Most of the figures in Table 2.1&#13;
-have been adopted from FAO./l Several of the commodities listed in Table 2.1&#13;
are composites of similar like foods. Such composites are the weighted&#13;
average of each of the component foods. The "other grains" composite, for&#13;
instance, is composed of 20% oats and 80% barley./2&#13;
1.17      A comprehensive reference for the food conversion rates is&#13;
Tables of Food Composition /2 (in Chinese). Unfortunately, the extensive&#13;
breakdown of each commodity by numerous varieties and grades makes this&#13;
excellent reference unusable at present. Tables of Food Composition&#13;
clearly shows the tremendous variation in nutrient content across variety and&#13;
grade. Protein content, for instance, varies from a low of 47 g/kg to a high&#13;
of 139 g/kg for the 28 varieties and grades of rice listed. Fat varies from&#13;
3 g/kg to 93 g/kg and energy from 3,330 kcal/kg to 3,730 kcal for these same&#13;
varieties and grades./4 If, for example, the nutrient content of rice bas&#13;
been overestimated by 10%, then total energy availability has been&#13;
overstated by 4%, total protein by 2.5%, and total fat by less than 1%.&#13;
/1 FAQ, The Composition of Some East Asian Foods (Rome, FAO, 1968).&#13;
/2 The "other grains" composite food conversion rate for years with&#13;
incomplete data is a weighted average of the nutrient composition of the&#13;
several coarse grains, pulses, and tubers represented by the "other grain"&#13;
composite. Time period specific food conversion rates for the "other&#13;
grain" composite are specified in Table 2 of Annex 2.&#13;

degree of processing are more important determinants of protein and fat&#13;
content relative to energy content.&#13;

2. TRENDS IN NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY&#13;
2.01      The yearly food balance sheets constructed for China present&#13;
detailed information as to the levels and sources of average daily per&#13;
capita nutrient availability. Energy, protein, and fat supplied by each of&#13;
the 21 commodities /1 is presented for each of the years 1950-81. Change&#13;
over time in the sources of nutrient supply and the issues of the adequacy&#13;
of the average diet of the Chinese and of protein quality are also&#13;
discussed. These results are then compared with results of other food&#13;
balance sheets compiled for China. The section concludes with an&#13;
examination of the reliability of the results.&#13;
A. Trends in Average Per Capita Daily Nutrient Availability&#13;
2.u2      total per capita daily availability and availability by source&#13;
(animal and vegetable) for energy, protein, and fat are presented in Table&#13;
2.1.' Production of selected commodities and of total grains is presented in&#13;
Table 2.2. Per capita daily energy and protein availability figures are&#13;
plotted in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. These data point out the close relationship&#13;
between per capita nutrient availability and trends over time in the&#13;
production of grain and other commodities. Trends in average per capita&#13;
nutrient availability are also, consequently, closely related to the&#13;
political and organizational changes which have contributed to the large&#13;
swings in agricultural production in China.&#13;
2.03      Per capita nutrient availability increased sharply during China's&#13;
recovery from civil war and throughout implementation of the First Five-Year&#13;
Plan (1953-57). Grain production increased over 50% with the rehabilitation&#13;
of the war-damaged agricultural infrastructure, extensive agrarian reform, and&#13;
other reorganizations of the agricultural sector during the 1950s. Food&#13;
production outpaced population growth and per capita daily energy avail-&#13;
ability grew by more than 25% during these years. Similar advances were&#13;
achieved in per capita availabilities of protein and fat. By 1958 national&#13;
average per capita energy availability approached 2,200 kcal per day,&#13;
approximately equal to per capita energy requirements.&#13;
2.04      The sharp decline of agricultural production beginning in 1959 has&#13;
been ascribed to the sudden implementation of the People's Commune system,&#13;
excessive conscription of agricultural labor for nonagricultural production&#13;
during the Great Leap Forward, widespread unfavorable weather patterns, and&#13;
/1 Only 15 or 16 commodities are presented for the years with incomplete&#13;
disaggregation of grain production.&#13;

the sudden withdrawal of Russian economic assistance. Whatever the&#13;
reasons, food production fell sharply during this period. The 1959-64 food&#13;
crisis may have been exacerbated by the slow response of the government due&#13;
to systematic falsification of production data in 1959-60. Because food&#13;
crop production data in the late 1950s were overstated, grain imports were&#13;
not increased until 1961 (i.e., until well into the food crisis:).&#13;
The drop in per capita nutrient availability as quantified by the food&#13;
balance sheets was severe and protracted. By 1960 per capita daily energy&#13;
availability had declined to under 1,600 kcal, a drop of approxlmately 30%&#13;
from the 1958 level. This level of per capita energy availability was&#13;
several hundred kcal below requirements. Per capita energy availability&#13;
remained well below requirements for several more years./l Per capita&#13;
protein and fat availability also fell below even the very depressed levels&#13;
of 1950. The extended fall in per capita nutrient availability brought&#13;
about a great deal of human suffering. Total population, which had been&#13;
growing by more than 10 million people per year prior to 1959, appears to&#13;
have decreased by several million during at least one and perhaps two years of&#13;
this period. The crude death rate in 1960 exceeded the 1959 rate by a large&#13;
margin./2 Per capita nutrient availability did not regain the Levels achieved&#13;
during the 1950s until the mid-1970s.   Energy availability was below energy&#13;
requirements for most of this period. The steady recovery from the 1960 floor&#13;
in nutrient availability was temporarily reversed with the disruption of&#13;
production at the height of the Cultural Revolution (1966-69).&#13;
2.05      Beginning with! the harvest of 1978, average per capita nutrient&#13;
availability has reached. a record high in China. In 1979, per capita energy&#13;
availability exceeded 2,500 kcal per day. Though 1980 and 1981 energy&#13;
availability figures were somewhat below the 1979 record, energy availability&#13;
has continued to exceed requirements by several hundred kcal and remains at&#13;
record high levels. Average energy and protein availability figures for China&#13;
for the years 1979-81 are compared with those of other countries in Table 2.3.&#13;
Average nutrient availability compares favorably with that of other low-income&#13;
countries and approacheE the average level of the middle-income countries.&#13;
/1 Daily per capita eneirgy availability is expressed as a percentage of&#13;
estimated requiremerLts in Table 2.9. Energy availability only met 71%&#13;
of energy requiremerLts in 1960.&#13;
/2 The extent of the decline in population and the increase of the death rate&#13;
during the 1960-63 period is uncertain. John Aird, for instance, has&#13;
pointed out that the decline in population for one or more years of the&#13;
1960-64 period claimed by the Chinese Government is not substantiated by&#13;
the age structure as reported by the official 1964 census. See John&#13;
Aird, "Recent Demographic Data from China: Problems and Prospects", in&#13;
China under the Four Modernizations (Washington, USGPO, 1982), p.172.&#13;

2.06      Record production of grains as well as oilseeds, sugar, red meats,&#13;
and other commodities have been central to the rise in per capita nutrient&#13;
availability since 1978. Net grain imports have also risen to record&#13;
levels, though such imports make only a minor contribution to national level&#13;
per capita nutrient avEailability./l This jumps in per capita nutrient&#13;
availability is remarkEable. Projected rates of growth for population and&#13;
agricultural production in the 1980s suggest that these per capita levels can&#13;
be maintained./2&#13;
B. Sources of Nutrient Supply&#13;
2.07      Increased per capita production of preferred and higher-quality /3&#13;
food commodities (e.g., fine grains, vegetable oils, and animal products)&#13;
/1 Net grain imports have contributed between 4 and 5% of total energy&#13;
availability since 1979.&#13;
/2 Population grew by just under 1.5% in 1981 and it is likely that the per&#13;
annum growth rate will decrease slightly from this level during the 1980s.&#13;
China's 1985 output targets for total grain, oilseeds, and meats all&#13;
imply growth rates well above the current population growth rate.   The&#13;
1985 target for total grain output of 375 million metric tons implies an&#13;
average yearly growth rate of 2.9% from Tuan and Surls' 1977-79 average&#13;
base period production level. Tlan and Surls consider the 1985 target to&#13;
be the upper bound Eor 1985 production, but report a historical growth&#13;
rate for grain production (2.3% p.a. for the 1955-57 to 1977-79 period)&#13;
which is well above the likely population growth rate during the 1980s.&#13;
See Frederic Surls and Francis Tuan, "China's Agriculture in the&#13;
Eighties" in China lJnder the Four Modernizations, op. cit., pp. 419-48.&#13;
/3 This transition of production follows consumer preferences which are, in&#13;
general, consistent with nutritionally higher-quality foods. Consumer&#13;
preferences dictate increased consumption of red meats, vegetable oils,&#13;
and dairy products, for instance. Increased consumption of these items&#13;
is likely to be nutritionally advantageous because of the presently very&#13;
low levels of consumption of these products in China.   The consumer&#13;
preference for increased consumption of refined sugar, however, may not&#13;
be consistent with improved nutrition given that average per capita&#13;
energy availability exceeds requirements. On the whole it appears that&#13;
the current preference-driven transition in the mix of agricultural&#13;
production is nutritionally advantageous. Improved absorption of amino&#13;
acids, vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients and increased availability&#13;
of linoleic acid and high nutrient density weaning foods result from this&#13;
transition. (Consumer preference for more highly refined products such&#13;
as white bread and highly polished rice, on the other hand, have a&#13;
negative nutritional, impact.)&#13;

accompanied growth in per capita income in China during the 1950s./1&#13;
Increased production of preferred commodities led to an absolute and relative&#13;
increase in the per capita availability of these commodities in the 1950s.&#13;
Per capita availability of preferred foods declined precipitously during the&#13;
period 1959-63, with the sharp fall in agricultural production. Only gradual&#13;
change in the relative shares of production of preferred commodities occurred&#13;
during the remainder of the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Since 1978, however,&#13;
substantial growth in the per capita production of preferred commodities has&#13;
resumed.&#13;
2.08      Changes in the importance of preferred commodities in the average&#13;
Chinese diet are most clearly evidenced by trends in the share of total&#13;
nutrient availability they supply. Tables 2.4 and 2.5 give percentage share&#13;
of total energy and protein availability from grains, fine and coarse grains,&#13;
vegetable oils, all crops, red meat, and all animal products. The percentage&#13;
shares of energy coming from aggregate crop production and from total grain&#13;
/1  This transition to "higher quality" and preferred foods is consistent&#13;
with Engel's Law, although income elasticity of demand may not play the&#13;
operative role to the same extent that it does in market economies. In&#13;
the 1950s Chinese planners foresaw the need for two changes in the mix of&#13;
agricultural production over time, though it has proven impossible to&#13;
carry out these changes until recently. As stated by Yen Shao-chWun in&#13;
1955:&#13;
(a) "With the rapid growth of crop production, the growth rate of&#13;
the output of staple food crops will be lower than those of&#13;
industrial crops, fodder crops, and horticultural crops.&#13;
Consequently, the relative share of staple food crops in the&#13;
output of crop production will gradually decrease. This change&#13;
is also determined by a change in the composition of people's&#13;
consumption. With the increasing satisfaction of people's&#13;
staple food requirements, the needs for light industrial&#13;
products, vegetables, and fruits will steadily increase; and&#13;
(b) When the rate of growth of gross agricultural output increases,&#13;
the rate of growth of animal husbandry will be faster than that&#13;
of crop production. Consequently, the share of animal hus-&#13;
bandry in gross agricultural outptlt will gradually increase.&#13;
This change is determined by a change in the composition&#13;
of people's consumption. The higher the people's standard&#13;
of living, the higher the proportion of consumer goods such&#13;

production are remarkably steady over time. Crop production's share of total&#13;
energy availability declines only slightly (96% to 94.5%) over the 32 years&#13;
under study. Energy supplied by all grains is nearly constant at 88% of&#13;
total energy availability, reflecting the dominance of this commodity group&#13;
in the Chinese diet. Energy availability from all animal sources has&#13;
generally remained within a narrow band centered around 4% of total energy.&#13;
Since 1979, however, animal sources have supplied greater than 5% of total&#13;
energy availability.&#13;
2.09      Relative shares of total protein supplied by these commodities&#13;
have not been as constant as those for energy (Table 2.5). Increased per&#13;
capita production of animal products resulted in only minor changes in the&#13;
sources of energy supply but has altered the sources of protein availability.&#13;
This is due to the fact that animal products are richer in protein relative&#13;
to grains and most other crops. Protein supplied by all animal sources&#13;
increased from less than 7% in 1950 to roughly 8.5% in the mid-1970s. The&#13;
share has increased to over 9.5% beginning in 1980.&#13;
2.10      The long-term growth of the relative share of total nutrients&#13;
supplied by fine grains (rice and wheat) at the expense of coarse grains is&#13;
also apparent (Tables 2.4 and 2.5). Except during the implementation of&#13;
People's Commune system, the Great Leap Forward Period, and at the height of&#13;
the Cultural Revolution, the share of total energy and total protein&#13;
supplied by fine grains has increased steadily since 1950.&#13;
2.11      These broad trends in the sources of protein and energy reflect&#13;
the substantial changes in the production and availability of individual&#13;
Foods. These changes in food availability in China are most clearly&#13;
iavidenced by trends in per capita availability of specific commodities. Per&#13;
:apita availability (kg per year) for each of the 21 commodities of the food&#13;
balance sheet time series are presented in Tables 2.6 and 2.7. Per capita&#13;
:-ice and wheat availability has steadily increased. Per capita rice&#13;
availability increased from about 63 kg in 1950 to roughly 90 kg beginning&#13;
1979.  Per capita wheat availability increased from less than 20 kg in 1950&#13;
1:o over 50 kg/year by 197'3. Corn availability has also increasecd steadily&#13;
iince 1950, though the intirease was offset by the rapid decline in&#13;
,ivailability of the other coarse grains (e.g., sorghum and millet:). Sharp&#13;
::ncreases in per capita availability of other nongrain crops in recent years&#13;
are also recorded in Table 2.6.   Recent increases in supplies of edible&#13;
iregetable oil,/l sugar and fruit further substantiate this changing pattern&#13;
of food production and consumption in China.    Table 2.7 details the sizeable&#13;
'1 Per capita production of edible vegetable oil now exceeds the levels&#13;
of the 1950s. Because total nutrient availability now exceeds that of&#13;
the 1950s, however, edible vegetable oil's share of total energy&#13;
availability is only tlow approaching the level attained in the mid 1950s.&#13;

increases in red meat and dairy product availabilities. Per capita pork,&#13;
beef and mutton availability has grown by over 50% since 1977. Egg and milk&#13;
availability have also increased since 1978,/l though current levels are&#13;
still relatively low by international standards.&#13;
C. Nutrient Requirements and Adequacy of the Diet&#13;
2.12      The nutritional adequacy of the average diet implied by the food&#13;
balance sheets may be broadly determined through comparison with reference&#13;
standards for average nutrient requirements. Food balance sheets present&#13;
only average nutrient availability, however, and may be poor indicators of&#13;
actual nutritional status. Adequate average nutrient availability should&#13;
not be misconstrued as necessarily implying adequate levels of nutritional&#13;
intake for the population as a whole. Unequal access to food supplies may&#13;
result in insufficient dietary intake for a large segment of the population,&#13;
despite a level of average per capita nutrient availability which exceeds&#13;
average nutrient requirements. However, the comparison of average nutrient&#13;
availability with average requirements remains a useful first step in&#13;
assessing adequacy of the diet.&#13;
2.13      Average nutrient requirements for a population are a function of&#13;
the population's age and sex distribution as well as activity levels and&#13;
body weights./2 Nutrient requirements differ across similar individuals,&#13;
furthermore, so that, at best, mean nutrient requirements can only be roughly&#13;
approximated.&#13;
2.14      Because these determinants of nutrient requirements change over&#13;
time, nutrient requirements also change over time. Current nutrient&#13;
requirements are in part also indirectly determined by current and previous&#13;
levels of nutrient intake, because weight and activity level are the body's&#13;
primary means for adjusting to fluctuations in dietary intake. Per capita&#13;
nutrient requirements increase, for example, for a population which has&#13;
experienced a long-term improvement in dietary intake.&#13;
/1 The stability of the poultry, eggs, and milk availability time series in&#13;
all but recent years is an artifact of the constant growth rate assumed&#13;
in the food balance sheet time series for eggs and milk prior to 1978&#13;
and poultry meat for all years.&#13;
/2 Nutrient requirements are also a function of health status, climate, and&#13;
other factors. Poor health may increase nutrient requirements, for&#13;
example, through the energy cost of running a fever or through the loss&#13;
of iron with hookworm infestation.&#13;

2.15      Per capita energy and protein requirements for China in 1979 have&#13;
been carefully estimated by Jamison et al./l They estimated daily energy&#13;
requirements to be 2,160 kcal and a safe level of protein intake at between&#13;
35.4 and 41.3 g/day./2   This model used the energy and protein requirements&#13;
specified by the 1973 FA0/WHO expert committee on nutrient requirements./3&#13;
Requirements have been adjusted for China's age, sex, and weight:&#13;
distributions and activity levels as estimated for 1979 by the Wlorld Bank./4&#13;
2.16      The 1979 energy requirement of 2,160 kcal per day proposed by&#13;
Jamison et al appears to be a reasonable approximation of true requirements&#13;
and is used in assessing energy availability in Table 2.9 below. Comparison&#13;
of protein availability with the upper bound for protein requirements&#13;
proposed by Jamison et aL (i.e., 41.3 g/day), however, results in the&#13;
erroneous conclusion that average protein availability exceeded requirements&#13;
for all years since 1950.&#13;
2.17      Comparison of protein availability with safe levels of protein&#13;
intake is an imperfect measure of the adequacy of average protein intake&#13;
for at least three reasons. First, uider conditions of inadequate energy&#13;
intake the body may utilize protein intake as a source of energy (rather&#13;
than synthesizing the amino acids from the protein). The safe level of&#13;
protein intake estimated by Jamison et al assumes adequate levels of energy&#13;
intake. Such estimates of protein requirements may be misleading for all&#13;
years for which energy availability is substantially below energy require-&#13;
ments (e.g., during the 1959-1964 food crisis).&#13;

Nutritional Status of Children in China" (Supplementary Paper III to&#13;
Annex B of China: Socialist Economic Development) (Washington, World&#13;
Bank, 1981).&#13;
/2 These safe levels have been adjusted for protein quality (see discussion&#13;
of protein quality below). Jamison et al estimated a safe Level of 24.8&#13;
g/day of protein in egg protein equivalent. 35.4 and 41.3 g/day are the&#13;
equivalent values for protein with scores of 70% and 60%.&#13;
/3 FAO/WHO Energy and Protein Requirements (FAO, 1973).&#13;
/4 Jamison et al estimate of energy requirements differs only slightly from&#13;
Smil's estimate of 2,120 kcal/day (See Smil, China's Food: Availability,&#13;
Requirements, Composition and Prospects, op cit., p. 70).&#13;

2.18      Secondly, the levels of absorption and utilization of amino acids&#13;
determine the adequacy of protein intake, not gross protein intake. Protein&#13;
which is poorly absorbed by the intestines and contains a large fraction of&#13;
redundant (and hence unutilizable) amino acids is considered "low quality"&#13;
protein. By this definition, vegetable proteins are of a lower quality&#13;
relative to protein from animal sources. The bulk of the protein available&#13;
in the typical Chinese diet is of low quality as a consequence of the&#13;
primary reliance upon cereals for nutrient supply. Alternative measures of&#13;
protein quality which account for digestibility and amino acid profile are&#13;
more accurate standards for assessing protein availability.&#13;
2.19      Finally, the small stomach capacity of infants limits their total&#13;
daily food intake. Though gross nutrient supplies may be adequate, the&#13;
infant may not be capable of consuming the required quantities of food. This&#13;
consideration is important where the local diet is largely composed of bulky&#13;
foods and gruels. In China, the primary reliance upon cereals and the&#13;
inadequacy of high nutrient density weaning foods may present special&#13;
problems for infants after their sixth month of life.&#13;
Protein Quality&#13;
2.20      The adequacy and net utilization of gross protein intake is&#13;
determined by the digestibility and the amino acid profile of the proteins&#13;
consumed. Because digestibility and amino acid profiles differ widely&#13;
between foods, protein quality also differs greatly across foods. The body&#13;
requires a certain ratio of amino acids for the synthesis of new protein&#13;
molecules and superfluous amino acids are utilized as energy. Synthesis of&#13;
new protein molecules is constrained by the amino acid which is in shortest&#13;
supply relative to requirements (i.e., the limiting amino acid). Chemical&#13;
score is a measurement of protein which devalues gross protein content&#13;
according to the amino acid profile of the particular food (but does not&#13;
account for digestibility). The content of each essential amino acid in a&#13;
food is expressed as a percentage of the content of the same amino acid in&#13;
the same quantity of a near perfect reference protein, egg. The amino&#13;
acid showing the lowest percentage is called the limiting amino acid and&#13;
this percentage is the chemical score./l Ho's estimate of a safe level of&#13;
protein intake of 41.3 g/day is for a protein with a chemical score of 60%.&#13;
2.21      Net protein utilization (NPU) is a superior measure in that it&#13;
accounts for both digestibility and amino acid profile (Table 2.8). NPU is&#13;
the product of digestibility ("The proportion of nitrogen that is absorbed.")&#13;
and biological value ("The proportion of absorbed nitrogen that is retained&#13;

energy and NPU protein are reported and expressed as a percentage of&#13;
requirements in Table 2.9. When gross protein availability is converted to&#13;
its NPU equivalent, prot:ein availability does not achieve a safe level&#13;
(i.e., 24.8 g/day) in 1950 or the years 1960-1963. As mentioned above,&#13;
however, any measurement: of protein intake may be a misleading indicator of&#13;
protein sufficiency under conditions of inadequate energy intake./2&#13;
D. Other Estimates of UIutrient Availability in China&#13;
2.22      A number of ot:her estimates of average nutrient availability in&#13;
China during the twentieth century have been compiled. Agricultural surveys&#13;
conducted by the National Agricultural Research Bureau and by J.L.     Buck in&#13;
the 1930s provided data for the first such estimates. These agricultural&#13;
surveys were necessarily limited in scope, but they represent the only&#13;
reasonably accurate references for that time period. FAO, Smil, Ho and others&#13;
have since compiled estimates for a number of years since 1949. Chinese&#13;
agricultural data for the period 1959 to 1977 has only recently improved, and&#13;
most of these subsequent: studies depended upon extensive estimat:es of&#13;
production, population, etc. for the period prior to 1978. The Chinese&#13;
Government has also estimated and released figures for per capit:a nutrient&#13;
availability. Many of these previous estimates have been reviewed by Smil./3&#13;
/1 FAO, ibid.&#13;
/2  Both NPU and, to a lesser extent, chemical score fail to account for the&#13;
ameliorating effects of the complementarity of proteins from different&#13;
foods. In effect, the total NPU for all the proteins consumed in the same&#13;
meal is greater tharL the sum of the NPU's for each of the proteins indi-&#13;
vidually. This complementarity is greater between proteins which have&#13;
been supplied from different classes of food. The complementarity qf the&#13;
proteins from rice (a cereal) and fish (an animal product), for instance,&#13;
is greater than the complementarity between rice and corn (both cereals).&#13;
In general, complementarity between proteins plays only a minor role in&#13;
the Chinese diet because of the dominance of cereals as a source of&#13;
nutrient supply.&#13;

and Studies, 16, No.4 (April 1980), pp. 37-44. Also see T. Wiens,&#13;
"Agricultural Statistics in the People's Republic of China," in&#13;

2.23      The results of Western and Chinese estimates of per capita daily&#13;
nutrient availability in China are summarized and compared with the results&#13;
of this study in Table 2.10. The impression of only little fluctuation over&#13;
time in per capita nutrient availability since 1933 is an artifact of the&#13;
years represented in Table 2.10. Considerable variation occured./l The&#13;
significant decline in per capita nutrient availability of the l19Os, for&#13;
instance, is not indicated in the Table./2 The consistent dominance of crop&#13;
production as a source of nutrient supply is clearly evidenced in Table 2.10.&#13;
2.24      The results of this study are reasonably consistent with the&#13;
results of the earlier studies. The Chinese studies seem the most optimistic&#13;
in terms of per capita availability and the FAO results are also somewhat&#13;
generous. Smil's and Ho's studies represent the lower bound. All of the&#13;
studies except Klatt's are within + 10% of the results of this study for&#13;
corresponding years. Klatt's estimate of average per capita daily energy&#13;
availability in 1960/61 of 1900 KCal exceeds the results of this study by&#13;
over 300 KCal (20%). The source of the discrepancy is Klatt's higher&#13;
estimate of total grain production of 190 million metric tons, which is&#13;
roughly 30% higher than the figures now reported by the Chinese. (Klatt's&#13;
estimate for the 1960-61 population of 650 million is also below current&#13;
estimates for that period). Production figures from this time period are&#13;
probably the least reliable of those of the post 1949 period. Klatt's grain&#13;
production figure for 1960-61 suggest, however, only a relatively minor&#13;
deviation from trend and is inconsistent with the massive shortfall of&#13;
production generally acknowledged for the 1959-63 period.&#13;
/1 The relatively high energy availability reported by Buck for the period&#13;
1929-33 is probably the result of an upward bias due to coverage of&#13;
richer agricultural zones in years of good weather. Smil ("Communist&#13;
China's Food: Still a Long Way to Go," op. cit.) devalues Buck's&#13;
estimate by 10% (i.e., down to 2,280 Kcal).&#13;
/2 Shen estimates that by the late 1940s population had increased about 5%&#13;
while foodcrop production had decreased about 5% relative to prewar&#13;
levels. Consequently, "the food consumption level of China since the&#13;
war has not recovered to the prewar level of consumption, which is&#13;
(itself) considered to (have been insufficient)." See, T.H. Shen,&#13;

E. Accuracy of the Results&#13;
Production and Demographic Data&#13;
2.25      It is possible to speculate as to the likely direction of the bias&#13;
of agricultural production and demographic data. Constraints of skilled&#13;
manpower and funding for statistical work are expected to have resulted in&#13;
undercounts of agricultural production and population totals. Falsification&#13;
of data due to political pressures may have had a greater impact upon the&#13;
collection and reporting of statistical data. Political exhortation at&#13;
times resulted in considerable overstatement of agricultural production and,&#13;
to a lesser extent, understatement of true population./l&#13;
2.26      Technical constraints and political expedience may have had signifi-&#13;
cant but offsetting effects upon the collection and reporting of agricultural&#13;
production data. Understatement of production is typical of newly developed&#13;
agricultural reporting systems such as China's./2 China's agricultural&#13;
production data have been revised upwards by more than 25%, however, when&#13;
considered to have been politically advantageous to do so./3 The net effect&#13;
of these two influences upon the currently official production figures is&#13;
ambiguous. Technical constraints and political expedience, on the other&#13;
/1 John Aird, "Recent Demographic Data from China: Problems and Prospects,"&#13;
in China Under the Four Modernizations (Washington, D.C., USGPO, 1982),&#13;
presents a brief history of the falsification of data in China. Aird&#13;
summarizes the abuses, disruptions, and eventual dismantling of the SSB&#13;
during the political tides of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural&#13;
Revolution.&#13;
/2 Much of this problem arises from the difficulties inherent in measuring&#13;
remote and small scale subsistence production. Collectivization of&#13;
China's agriculture in the 1950s ameliorated this problem and thereby&#13;
greatly enhanced the SSB's ability to collect accurate and comprehensive&#13;
agricultural data. China's statistical system, however, is not designed&#13;
to collect production data from private plot production. Such&#13;
production is probably estimated by the Chinese as the product of&#13;
private plot area and assumed yields. Currently private plot area is&#13;
approaching 15% of total arable land and private plot production as a&#13;
percentage of total production no doubt exceeds 15%.'&#13;
/3 The 1958 production figure for total grain of 250 million metric tons&#13;
reported in China: Ten Great Years (op. cit.), for example, is clearly&#13;
inflated and exceeds the current estimate for 1958 by 25%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
hand, have together given an unambiguous downward bias to China's demographic&#13;
estimates. China's birth control campaigns of the past decade and a half&#13;
have undoubtedly exerted great political and economic pressure upon cadres&#13;
to underreport births. In the present context of planned agricultural&#13;
production and human reproduction, the penalties are severe for the cadre&#13;
who is responsible for reporting above quota reproduction.&#13;
2.2/      Wiens has presented a careful review of the agricultural produc-&#13;
tion data for China avaLlable as of the mid-1970s (i.e., data available&#13;
prior to the more recent release of official data)./l Official agricultural&#13;
statistics for the period 1949-57 have been questioned on the grounds that&#13;
initial estimates of production were subject to incomplete enumeration and&#13;
nonrandom sampling and that area and yield figures were below those reported&#13;
for the 1930s. After a careful analysis, Wiens concludes that 1949-50 data&#13;
understate true product:Lon, but data for 1952 to 1957 are reasonably&#13;
accurate. The impact oi: this discrepancy between true and reported&#13;
production would result in an understatement of nutrient availability in the&#13;
food balance sheets for the 1950-51 period.&#13;
2.28      The recent release of a large amount of official demographic data&#13;
and the completion of the 1982 census have brought about a convergence of the&#13;
foreign estimates of Chi.na's population.  According to John Aird, "What&#13;
divergence still remainEi among foreign estimates is due to differences of&#13;
opinion about the margin of undercount in the official figures."/2 The&#13;
mid-year population figures used in the food balance sheet time series&#13;
compare closely with those released by the Chinese and with estimates&#13;
prepared by Aird and others.&#13;
Food Utilization and Other Data&#13;
2.29      Little reliable data on food utilization and nutrient composition&#13;
are available from Chine!se sources. The food balance sheets have instead&#13;
relied upon whatever evidence could be gleaned from various Chinese publica-&#13;
tions, biological and manufacturing standards, and international comparison&#13;
to construct estimates of the relevant parameters. The parameters estimated&#13;
include important variables such as the percentage of grain fed to livestock&#13;
and less important items such as the sucrose content of China's sugarbeet&#13;
production. The number of parameters estimated is large and onLy those&#13;
parameters which have a significant affect on nutrient availability are&#13;
discussed below.&#13;

2.30      Production and trade figures for rice are expressed in the food&#13;
balance sheets in paddy weight. Removal of the husk and polishing of the&#13;
kernel results in an estimated loss of 33% of paddy weight. Modern rice&#13;
milling technology (rubber rollers) results in a loss of only 30% of paddy&#13;
weight, while smaller scale antiquated technologies involve losses of&#13;
perhaps 32% (disk shellers) to 37% (steel hullers)./l If all of China's&#13;
rice were processed by modern rubber rollers,/2 per capita daily energy&#13;
supplies would be roughly 2% greater than the availabilities presented in&#13;
the food balance sheets (protein and fat would increase about 1%)./3 Most&#13;
of China's rice is processed in rural areas with antiquated equipment,&#13;
however.' If all of China's rice were processed by steel hullers, per capita&#13;
nutrient supplies would be between 1 and 2% less than the availabilities&#13;
reported in the food balance sheets. The 67% rice extraction coefficient&#13;
used in the food balance sheets lies between these extremes and would at&#13;
most involve a distortion of nutrient availability of + 2%.&#13;
2.31      It has generally been assumed that livestock consume between 7 and&#13;
11% of China's total grain production. The livestock feeding regimen model&#13;
used in the food balance sheets implies a somewhat higher level of feedgrain&#13;
consumption of between 11 and 12% of total grain production. Feedgrain&#13;
consumption has been estimated in this study by assuming zero feedgrain&#13;
consumption by poultry and a feedgrain to pork meat conversion ratio of&#13;
3.85:1 /4 (1979 figures). Despite these conservative assumptions, the&#13;
figures for feedgrain employed in the food balance sheets should be&#13;
interpreted as the upper bound for actual feedgrain consumption. Diversion&#13;
of grain to the livestock sector, furthermore, would be rapidly curtailed&#13;
during years of inadequate supplies of grain for human consumption such as&#13;
the period 1959-64.&#13;
/1  See Merle Esmay, et al., Rice Postproduction Technology in the Tropics&#13;
(USA, University Press of Hawaii, 1979), p. 99.&#13;
/2 The 70% extraction figure reported to the World Bank's Economic Mission&#13;
to China implies that all rice produced in China is processed by rubber&#13;
rollers.&#13;
/3 These percentage increases would obtain only in recent years. Smaller&#13;
increases would obtain for earlier years as per capita rice production&#13;
has increased over time.&#13;
/4  The pork conversion ratio implies a high level of efficiency relative to&#13;
world standards.   The concentrate (i.e., feedgrain plus high nutritive&#13;
value bran, oil seed cake, etc.) to pork meat ratio is roughly 7.45:1&#13;
(1979 figure), however, which seems more consistent with the relatively&#13;
inefficient standards of pork production in China.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
2.32      If only 9X of total grain production was consumed by China's live-&#13;
stock in 1981, true per capita daily energy availability would be approxi-&#13;
mately 3% (and protein 3% and fat 1%) greater than the figures presented in&#13;
the 1981 food balance sheet. Total per capita daily energy availability would&#13;
have been about 2,600 keal, which more closely approximates the SSB estimate&#13;
of 2,666 kcal for 1981. If only 6% of total grain production was fed to&#13;
livestock in 1960, per capita daily energy supply would have exceeded 1,600&#13;
kcal (5% greater than the figure in the 1960 food balance sheet). Protein&#13;
availability would have been 4% greater and fat 2% greater. Had no grain been&#13;
fed to livestock in 1960), per capita daily energy availability would have&#13;
still been less than 1,700 kcal.   In sum the feedgrain consumption figures&#13;
used in the food balance sheets may understate nutrient availability by as&#13;
much as 4% (or more in crisis years). Unfortunately, even assuming that no&#13;
grain was fed to livestock during the 1959-1964 food crisis, per capita daily&#13;
energy availability would still have been several hundred kcal below&#13;
requirements.&#13;
2.33      Other areas where little precise, documented information is avail-&#13;
able are the amount of food lost through waste,/l seed requirements, food&#13;
and nonfood manufacturing requirements,/2 and stocks. Several of the&#13;
parameters assumed involve substantial disappearance of domestic food supplies&#13;
or are otherwise important determinants of net nutrient availability. The&#13;
margins of error, however, are small relative to the degree of error which&#13;
may be present in the production and demographic data or the assumptions&#13;
regarding milling or feedgrain consumption.&#13;
/1  The 3% waste coefficient assumed for most commodities greatly exceeds&#13;
the figures claimed by the Chinese, but nevertheless seems low by compa-&#13;
rison with other developing and developed countries. Vaclav Smil,&#13;
"China-s Food: Availability, Requirements, Composition, Prospects,"&#13;
op. cit., p. 68, uses a 4% coefficient for waste.&#13;
/2 An unknown amount of barley, rice, sorghum, and other foods was required&#13;
to produce between 2 and 3 million metric tons of alcoholic beverages in&#13;
1981.  (Production of alcoholic beverages is estimated from the rural&#13;
per capita consumption figures from the 1981 consumption survey of rural&#13;
households. See SSFI, 1981 Chinese Statistical Yearbook, (Hongkong,&#13;
Chinese Overseas Press, 1982) p. 434.) The net loss of nutrient content&#13;
involved in brewing and distilling is not known. Omission of the net&#13;
loss of nutrients due to production of alcoholic beverages (and all&#13;
other such processing not reflected in the food balance sheets) results&#13;
in a relatively minor upward bias to the food balance sheets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
2.34      Very little is known about the size of China's grain reserves or&#13;
of year to year fluctuations in such stocks. Smil uses the figure of&#13;
15.5 million metric tons for central government stocks in the 1950s./i&#13;
Stone reports the figure of 40+- million metric tons for the early 1970s./2&#13;
No figures are available for total local and provincial level stocks, but&#13;
such stocks are not large relative to central governments stocks. The 1950s&#13;
and early 1970s stocks figures imply that stocks were increasing by roughly&#13;
one million metric tons of grain per year on average. For the average year,&#13;
the ommission of the yearly one million metric tons addition to stocks as a&#13;
grain end use would result in only a minor overestimate of nutrient&#13;
availability for that year. As stocks are built up in years of heavy&#13;
production and disbursed in years of insufficient production, the omission&#13;
of changes in stocks from the food balance sheets presumably results in&#13;
underestimates of nutrient availability in years of lean harvests and&#13;
overestimates in other years.&#13;
2.35      In summary, it appears that the per capita nutrient availability&#13;
figures presented here may be positively biased due to (i) undercount of&#13;
the population and (ii) the omission some manufacturing end uses of food&#13;
supplies. The amount of grain presumed fed to livestock may overstate true&#13;
feedgrain consumption, on the other hand, which would bias the results&#13;
downward. Inaccuracy in the production data and in the assumptions&#13;
regarding rice extraction rates, waste losses, etc. result in potentially&#13;
major margins of error which are of ambiguous direction. However, major&#13;
trends in nutrient availability would not be reversed by a 5 or even a 10%&#13;
margin of error. Nutrient availability in 1960, for instance, would remain&#13;
far below requirements under any set of plausible assumptions. Similarly,&#13;
the possibility is remote that average nutrient availability does not cur-&#13;
rently significantly exceed requirements&#13;
3.' REGIONAL AND PROVINCIAL TRENDS IN NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY&#13;
3.01      Differences in food availability and consumption across locality&#13;
and socioeconomic status cannot be directly assessed through national level&#13;
food balance sheets. Instead, regional food availability is approximated&#13;
through regional food balance sheets. Differences in food consumption&#13;
across locality and socioeconomic status can be estimated using data from&#13;

food consumption and ant'hropometric surveys./l In this section the&#13;
available information on regional agricultural production and interregional&#13;
agricultural trade is assembled. Provincial crop production for 1979-80 and&#13;
provincial grain production and population data for selected years are&#13;
presented in Annex 4.' Regional and provincial trends in per capita grain&#13;
production over time, and then provincial nutrient availability for the&#13;
years 1979 and 1981 are broadly approximated.&#13;
Regional Per Capita Grain Production&#13;
3.02      Official per capita provincial grain production data /2 for 1979&#13;
have been recorded for each province, autonomous region and municipality in&#13;
Figure 3.1.  Per capita average grain production in all of the provinces&#13;
inside and to the right of the heavy dividing line in Figure 3.1 is above&#13;
the national per capita average grain production figure of 342 kg/year./3&#13;
Per capita production in all of the provinces and autonomous regions outside&#13;
and to the left of the boundary is below the national average. The ten&#13;
provinces producing above the national average include the three Northeastern&#13;
provinces as well as seven provinces which are located in the river basin&#13;
areas of the Huang and Changjiang rivers. The three Northeastern provinces&#13;
have received substantial support from the central government to assist in&#13;
reclaiming large tracts of land for agricultural production. TLe central&#13;
government's investments in the Northeast were made in large part with the&#13;
intention of establishin;g an area with a large marketable surplus of food&#13;
production, so it is not surprising that per capita production of grain in&#13;
these provinces is above the national average. The below average areas are&#13;
comprised of both densely populated provinces (e.g. Henan province) and&#13;
sparsely populated provinces and autonomous regions (e.g., Qinghai and&#13;
Xizang).&#13;
/1  Results from a number of food consumption and anthropometric surveys&#13;
have recently been released by the Government. Anthropometric data broken&#13;
down by locality, household income and other socioeconomic indicators are&#13;
available for a number of years from 1910 to present.&#13;
/2  Grain as defined by the SSB includes rice, wheat, coarse grains, tubers,&#13;
soybeans and other pulses. Per capita figures are as report:ed in the&#13;
1980 Chinese Agricultural Yearbook op. cit. These figures use the&#13;
1979 year-end provincial populations and are therefore compiled according&#13;
to the year-end 1979 revised provincial boundaries.&#13;
/3 Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai municipalities, however, are all sub-&#13;
stantially below the national average. Actual foodgrain availability&#13;
in these municipalitles, however, is well above the national average due&#13;
to interprovincial aiad international grain trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
3.03      Interprovincial grain trade is currently quite limited in China&#13;
(perhaps about 1% of annual production) and roughly 88% of daily average&#13;
energy intake (see the 19/9 food balance sheet) comes from grains. It is&#13;
therefore quite likely that in 1979 the region to the right of the dividing&#13;
line Figure 3.1 enjoyed a significant advantage in average nutrient&#13;
availability and consumption.&#13;
3.04      The 1979 national division between above and below average per&#13;
capita grain producing regions does not hold for other commodities. Most&#13;
notably (in terms of nutritional consequences), several provinces and&#13;
autonomous regions to the left and outside of the national division are above&#13;
the national per capita red meat production figure. Similarly, most of&#13;
China-s sugar production is in Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces.&#13;
Nevertheless, the national division as determined by per capita grain&#13;
production is a key indicator of provincial per capita nutrient availability.&#13;
Provincial Per Capita Grain Production, 1949-81&#13;
3.05      Due to data constraints, per capita grain production by province&#13;
has been calculated for selected years only. Figures for the 17 years&#13;
presented here, furthermore, are complete for only 3 provinces and are&#13;
unreliable for some provinces for some years. Preliminary results have been&#13;
estimated from very rough calculations of provincial production and&#13;
population.&#13;
3.06      Except for recent years for which Chinese provincial grain&#13;
production data are readily available, all previous years' production&#13;
figures are taken from the USDA's "PRC Provincial Total Grain Production."/l&#13;
Tuan has carefully reconstructed provincial grain production figures from&#13;
output and growth rates gleaned from numerous sources. Midyear provincial&#13;
populations for the 17 years have been estimated from the provincial&#13;
population breakdowns available for the years 1953, 1957, 1964, 1978, 1979&#13;
and 1981.' The estimated provincial populations have been adjusted to agree&#13;
with the World Bank's demographic model of China. Unfortunately, the&#13;
production and population estimates are subject to considerable error and&#13;
the two series may not be strictly comparable with each other due to changes&#13;
in provincial boundaries in 1969 and in 1979.&#13;
/1 Provincial total grain production for 1949, 1952, 1957, 1965 and&#13;
1969-1978 are from Tuan, PRC Provincial Total Grain Production 1969-1979&#13;
(Washington, USDA/IED.ERS, 1981) p. 4.' Official 1979-1981 provincial&#13;
breakdowns of total grain production are from the 1980 and 1981 Chinese&#13;
Agricultural Yearbook's op. cit. and the 1981 Chinese Statistical&#13;
Yearbook op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
3.07      Official provincial population estimates are available for year end&#13;
1957, 1978, 19/9 and 1981 and midyear 1953 and 1964.11 No provincial popula-&#13;
tion time series has been estimated heretofore for China because of lack of&#13;
data and due to complications regarding interprovincial migration and&#13;
redefinitions of provincial boundaries. Most significantly, the boundaries&#13;
between Nei Mongol and the five neighboring provinces of Gansu, Ningxia,&#13;
Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang were altered in 1969 and then returned to&#13;
the pre-1969 boundaries in 1979./2 Accurate per annum population growth&#13;
rates for these six provinces cannot be estimated for the period 1969-78, so&#13;
a composite population growth rate figure for those provinces has been used.&#13;
All of the estimated provincial populations are for the purposes of tracking&#13;
trends in provincial per capita grain production only.&#13;
3.08      The provincial population breakdowns for 1953, 1957 and 1964 have&#13;
been weighted according to the ratio of total population .from the World Bank's&#13;
demographic model of China to official figures for total population for the&#13;
same years. Provincial populations have been interpolated from these and&#13;
other years with known provincial populations. Yearly growth rates for the&#13;
provincial populations have been weighted by the growth rate of the total&#13;
population for each year in each of the subperiods. The resulting estimates&#13;
assume that interprovincial migration has been evenly distributed within&#13;
each of the subperiods.&#13;
3.09      The available provincial grain production data are in general&#13;
expressed according to the provincial boundaries in effect at t'he time the&#13;
data were released./3 I'he major exceptions are the six provinces mentioned&#13;
above. Provincial production figures for these provinces for the 1977-78&#13;
period appear to be repc,rted according to current (i.e., post 1979)&#13;
boundaries while early and mid-1970s figures appear to be reported according&#13;
to the boundaries of thea period 1969-78.&#13;
/1 See 1981 Chinese Statistical Yearbook op. cit. p. 90 for 1981 and&#13;

op. cit." pg. 197 for all other years.&#13;
/2 Parts of Nei Mongol were absorbed by these neighboring five provinces&#13;
in 1969 and then rel:urned to Nei Mongol in July 1979.' Consequently, Nei&#13;
Mongol's 1978 population of 8.9 million was reported as 18.52 million&#13;
in 1979 (year-end f!igures). Corresponding decreases in population were&#13;
registered in the neighboring five provinces.&#13;
/3 Tuan is not precise on this matter, presumably because provincial&#13;
boundaries were not usually released along with the provincial production&#13;
figures he used.&#13;

3.10      The midyear provincial population figures for this same period,&#13;
1965-1979, have been estimated using 1979 yearend figures. This ignores the&#13;
boundary revisions in effect during the 1969-79 period. Consequently, the&#13;
per capita grain production figures for the six provinces mentioned above&#13;
are not reliable for the period 1969-76./i In particular, the results for&#13;
Gansu are misleading and are not presented for the years 1970-75.&#13;
3.11      Provincial per capita total grain production figures are presented&#13;
in Table 3.1. Table 3.2 expresses these figures as a percentage of same&#13;
year national per capita total grain production. Provincial per capita&#13;
production figures for the 1970s are roughly consistent with the ranking&#13;
according to per capita production represented in Figure 3.1. Provinces&#13;
producing above the national per capita average in 1979 (see Figure 3.1) have&#13;
been producing above the average for most of the years 1970-81. The pattern&#13;
of provincial per capita production was significantly different during the&#13;
1950s, however. Most notably, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, Xinjiang and Guangdong&#13;
were producing at or above the national average during the 1950s. These&#13;
provinces experienced declines in per capita production during the 1960s and&#13;
are now producting below the per capita national average. Per capita produc-&#13;
tion in Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong and Jiangsu was well below the national&#13;
average during the 1950s, but these provinces are now producing above the&#13;
national average.&#13;
Provincial Food Balance Sheets, 1979 and 1980&#13;
3.12      Provincial breakdowns of production of grains, oilseeds, sugar,&#13;
fruit, red meats, fish and milk detailed in the 1980 and 1981 Chinese&#13;
Agricultural Yearbook's make possible the compilation of provincial-level&#13;
tables of total food production for 1979 and 1980. These several commodities&#13;
are the nutritionally most important foods in the Chinese diet. Deriving&#13;
provincial per capita nutrient availability figures from these provincial&#13;
production figures requires all of the same information as do the national&#13;
food balance sheets plus data for interprovincial trade in grain and other&#13;
commodities.&#13;
/1 The 1977 and 1978 provincial production and population figures are&#13;
apparently based upon the same border definitions and are expected to be&#13;
accurate.&#13;

3.13      Provincial per capita nutrient availabilities for 1979-80&#13;
(Table 3.3) are closely related to provincial per capita grain production&#13;
for these years./l The regional pattern in per capita grain production of&#13;
Figure 3.1 roughly approximates the regional pattern in per capita nutrient&#13;
availability. Except for China's three municipalities which were the chief&#13;
beneficiaries of interprovincial and international trade in grain, the&#13;
provincial per capita nutrient availability figures are reasonably good&#13;
indicators of nutrient supply for these years./2 Most of the serious&#13;
shortfall in average provincial nutrient availability occurs in the&#13;
Northwestern and Southwestern provinces noted earlier.&#13;
3.14      Provincial per capita nutrient availability for 1979 and 1980 has&#13;
been estimated assuming zero interprovincial and international trade of food&#13;
commodities. Interprovincial trade in food grains represents a very small&#13;
and declining share of total grain production./3 Total interprovincial&#13;
trade of grain in 1965, for example, was only ~77 million metric tons and&#13;
declined to 2.05 million metric tons in 1978 (i.e., a decline from only 2.4%&#13;
of total grain production to less than 0.7% in 1978). "Comparing 1965 to&#13;
1978, provinces which transferred out grain diminished from 15 to only 8,&#13;
and the amount of grain transferred decreased by 2.65 million metric tons&#13;
from 4.7 million metric tons to 2.05 million metric tons. The number of&#13;
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions receiving shipments&#13;
increased from 12 to 18 and the amount of grain transferred increased by&#13;
2.95 million metric tons; from 6.55 million metric tons to 9.5 million metric&#13;
tons."/4 (The figures include both interprovincial and international trade&#13;
/1  National average per capita nutrient availability is underreported in&#13;
Table 3.3 because oi' the omission of international trade. Provincial&#13;
breakdowns for veget:ables, voultry meat, other meats, eggs, and animal&#13;
fats are not available. Energy from these five commodities represents&#13;
less than 5% of the total energy available in the average diet of the&#13;
Chinese. The figures for energy, protein and fat contributed by these&#13;
five commodities to the national average diet have been added directly&#13;
to the nutrient availabilities supplied hy the other 16 commodities for&#13;
which provincial production data is available.&#13;
/2  Actual nutrient avaiLlability in 1979 in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai&#13;
was substantially greater than the levels reported in Table 3.3.&#13;

of grain. InterprovinciLal imports exceed exports by the amount: of net&#13;
international grain trade in 1965 and 1978.)   International and domestic&#13;
grain shipments of only 6.55 million metric tons in 1965 and only 9.5&#13;
million metric tons in 1978 were transferred to 12 (1965) and 18 (1978)&#13;
provinces.&#13;
3.15      The combined impact of interprovincial and international trade of&#13;
grain (and other foods) upon provincial disparities in nutrient availability&#13;
cannot be specified due to lack of knowledge as to which provinces are the&#13;
recipients of food transfers. The energy requirements in unprocessed wheat&#13;
equivalent in 1979 to meset the energy shortfalls in those provinces and&#13;
municipalities falling below average energy requirements are calculatetd in&#13;
Table 3.4. Food transfers no doubt increase per capita daily nutrient&#13;
availability in China's three municipalities to well above the national&#13;
average nutrient availalbility. Increasing per capita energy availability in&#13;
Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to 2,600 KCal per day (i.e. rouglhly the 1979&#13;
national average) would have required about 3.5 million metric tons of&#13;
unprocessed wheat in 1979. Increasing per capita energy availability to the&#13;
average energy requiremeant of 2,160 KCal per day in 1979 in the 10 provinces&#13;
with average energy availability below this level would require a further&#13;
6.5 million metric tons of wheat.&#13;
3.16      The 1979 totaL energy shortfall was equivalent to roughly 10 million&#13;
tons of unprocessed wheat or 3% of China-s total grain production. It is&#13;
not clear to what extent the regional nutrient shortfalls are currently being&#13;
redressed in China. Previous efforts to correct for provincia'L disparity in&#13;
nutrient availability were minimal and appear to have been insufficient./l&#13;
Supplying these nutritional shortfalls will require a far reaching program&#13;
of agricultural development and income generation in these out'Lying&#13;
provinces.&#13;

A. PRODUCTION DATA&#13;
1.01      The availability and accuracy of production data differ by&#13;
commodity and across time. The Chinese Government has released,/l for&#13;
instance, complete series for total grain, rice, wheat, and aquatic products&#13;
production for the years 1950 to 1981. Production figures for numerous other&#13;
commodities (corn, sorghum, millet, tubers, soybeans, other grains, peanuts,&#13;
oilseeds, sugar, fruits, pork, beef, and mutton, and milk) have been released&#13;
for less than half of the years under study. For other commodities (pulses,&#13;
vegetables, poultry meat, other meat, eggs, and animal fats) production&#13;
figures have never been released and can only be roughly estimated. The&#13;
availability of production data and related assumptions and models are&#13;
specified below (by commodity) and are summarized in Table 1.&#13;
1.02      Grains.   The figures for total grain production reported by the&#13;
Chinese Government include rice, wheat, coarse grains, soybeans and tubers.&#13;
Coarse grains include corn, sorghum, millet, other grains (barley, oats, and&#13;
other minor grains) and pulses. Together, these commodities are represented&#13;
as the first nine rows of the complete food balance sheets. Complete time&#13;
series have been released for total grain, rice, and wheat production and&#13;
these figures are used in the food balance sheets./2 Corn, sorghum, millet,&#13;
tubers and soybean production figures have been released for the years 1952,&#13;
1957, 1962, 1965, 1970 and 1976-81./3 The figures for production of each of&#13;
the grains as reported for 1962 and 1978, however, are inconsistent with the&#13;
total grain production figures reported for those years and have not been&#13;

used in the food balance sheets. Tuber production figures have been&#13;
reported at a grain equivalency ratio of four kg of tubers to one kg of&#13;
grain prior to 1963 and at a ratio of five to one beginning in 1963./i These&#13;
tuber figures have been entered directly into the food balance sheets in&#13;
order to preserve consistency within the production column. Nutrient&#13;
composition figures (see below), however, have been adjusted to compensate&#13;
for the difference in grain equivalency ratios.&#13;
1.03      The USDA has published complete production time series for corn,&#13;
sorghum, millet, tubers, soybeans, barley, and oats. The USDA figures for&#13;
the years not reported by the Chinese are rough estimates, and do not reflect&#13;
the absolute and relative growth of corn production at the expense of other&#13;
coarse grains. Though i:he Chinese Government has not released specific&#13;
production figures for l:he above mentioned commodities for 21 of the 32 years&#13;
under investigation (and only inconsistent figures for two other years),&#13;
total production of these grains (including pulses) can be derived as the&#13;
residual between total grain production minus the figures for rice and wheat&#13;
production. Instead of reporting the USDA production figures for each of&#13;
these grains, the food balance sheets present the sum of these commodities as&#13;
"other grains" (row 9). For years with an incomplete (or an inaccurate)&#13;
disaggregation of total grain production, the other grains composite&#13;
includes corn, sorghum, millet, tubers, soybeans, pulses, and other minor&#13;
grains (barley, oats, etc.) For years with a complete disaggregation, the&#13;
other grains category re!presents barley, oats, and any other minor grains.&#13;
Commodity shares of the "other grains" composite figure are reported in&#13;
footnotes H (years prior' to 1957) and G (1958 and following years) of the&#13;
food balance sheets. Commodity shares have been estimated as the average of&#13;
the commodity shares obtaining for the year prior to and the year following&#13;
the period with insufficient data (e.g., commodity shares for the period&#13;
1950-56 are the average of the shares obtaining in 1952 and 1957). The&#13;
commodity shares of the "other grains" composite are summarized in Table 2.&#13;
1.04      Neither the Chinese Government nor the USDA publish figures for&#13;
production of pulses.    The Chinese agricultural statistical system does&#13;
not require production units to report pulse production. Instead, only a&#13;
production figure for the category "other grains" is required. The other&#13;
grains category includes pulses, barley, oats, rye and other minor grains.&#13;
The other grains figures are probably composed of greater than 50% grains&#13;
(oats, barley, etc.) and less than 50% pulses. Previous food balance sheets&#13;
for China (Smil, 1978; Ho et al, 1981) have reported the entire other grains&#13;
figure as pulse production. (see Table 4 below.) Such an approach&#13;
overstates true pulse production and, hence, protein availability.&#13;
/1 The exact year of the switch from the 4 to 1 ratio to the 5 to 1 is&#13;
not known. Bruce Stone, Food Production in the People's Republic of&#13;
China, (Washington D.C., IFPRI Research Report 15, 1980) p. 89, believes&#13;
the 5 to 1 ratio was adopted in 1963.&#13;

1.05      Pulse production has been estimated in the present study by sub-&#13;
tracting out barley and oats production figures (USDA production time&#13;
series) from the other grains residual. While the pulse residuals depend&#13;
heavily upon the USDA barley and oats production time series (which are&#13;
largely judgmental and prepared only because of USDA reporting requirements)&#13;
and still include some "other minor grains," the residuals almost certainly&#13;
represent a more accurate quantification of pulses production than that of&#13;
the other entire grain category. The sum of the USDA figures for barley and&#13;
oats production has been included as the other grains entry in the food&#13;
balance sheets with complete data. Pulse production data estimated&#13;
primarily from Chinese sources is presented in Table 3. The miscellaneous&#13;
grains residual derived from USDA data, which should not be misconstrued as&#13;
true pulse production, is presented in Table 4.&#13;
1.06      Vegetable Oils.   Edible vegetable oils in China include oils from&#13;
soybeans, cottonseed, peanuts, rapeseed, sesameseed, sunflowerseed and other&#13;
minor oilseeds. Official total edible oil production figures are available&#13;
for the years 1977 to 1980. Edible oil production for all other years has&#13;
been estimated using oilseed production time series. A number of complete&#13;
and partial time series for these oilseeds have been released by the&#13;
Government.   Production figures are available for soybeans, peanuts,&#13;
rapeseed, sesameseed, sunflowerseed and other oilseeds for the years 1952,&#13;
1957, 1965, 1970, and 1976-81. Cottonseed production is estimated from the&#13;
complete cotton production time series. The cottonseed to cotton ratio of&#13;
2 to 1 has been adopted. The 1980 Chinese Agricultural Yearbook reports a&#13;
"total oilseeds" production time series for the years 1949 to 1965 and 1970&#13;
to 1979. This total oilseeds production time series includes peanut,&#13;
rapeseed, sesame seed, sunflower seed, and other oilseeds production. "Other&#13;
oilseeds" represents about 7% of the total oilseeds figure and includes&#13;
inedible linseed and castorbean oils and minor quantities of other oilseeds.&#13;

1.07      Edible vegetable oil production has been calculated from these&#13;
oilseed production data in a fashion similar to the method of calculating&#13;
production of coarse grains specified above. Share of total oilseeds&#13;
production for peanuts, rapeseed and sesameseed has been derived as the&#13;
average of the oilseed shares obtained in the year prior to and the year&#13;
following the period without data. Estimates of peanut, rapeseed and&#13;
sesameseed production were then derived from the total oilseeds and oilseeds'&#13;
shares time series. Part of the "other oilseed" production was absorbed into&#13;
the derived peanut, rapeseed and sesameseed figures as a hedge against the&#13;
omission of other vegetable oils such as rice bran oil and sunflowerseed&#13;
oil. Sunflowerseed production has only recently become an important source&#13;
of vegetable oil in China. Production prior to 1977 was presumed negligible&#13;
at the national level. Soybean production figures for missing years have&#13;
been interpolated from the reported data. Specifically, growth rates&#13;
derived from known end year values have been applied to the base year&#13;
figures to arrive at missing year values.&#13;
1.08      The oilseed production time series were converted to their oil&#13;
equivalents using a set of crush and extraction rates. Crush rates (i.e.,&#13;
the percentage of the total crop used for oil production) and extraction&#13;
rates (the share of oil extracted per ton of oilseed crushed) are presented&#13;
in Table 5. The crush and extraction rates are conservative estimates by&#13;
world standards. Edible vegetable oil production figures estimated from&#13;
this procedure (see Table 7) are compared with the official Chinese figures&#13;

the food balance sheets into the components consumed directly as food (A) and&#13;
as oil (B). The breakdown is somewhat arbitrary.   Production, trade,&#13;
domestic supply and waste figures for soybeans and peanuts are reported in&#13;
unprocessed weight. Figures in the "food" column of the food balance sheets&#13;
(column VI, rows 7B and 10B) record net processed oil availability from the&#13;

sugarcane and sugarbeet production figures using the conservative extraction&#13;
rates of 9% (cane) and 12% (beet). Actual extraction rates depend on&#13;
sucrose content, spoilage, and technology.  Sugar production figures&#13;

1.11      Fruits and Vegetables.  Fruit production data have been released&#13;
for 13 of the 32 years under study and vegetable planted area figures for 7&#13;
of the 32 years.  No national level vegetable production data have been&#13;
released. Fruit production figures for missing years were interpolated from&#13;
known values assuming linear growth rates. Similarly, vegetable area&#13;
figures for missing years were interpolated from known values (the area&#13;
values for the period 1950 to 1956, however, were derived by diminishing the&#13;
1957 figure by 1.7% per annum, i.e., the per annum growth rate of arable&#13;
land for the period 1949-1957). Vegetable production was then estimated by&#13;
multiplying area figures by per hectare yield data. 1957 yield was assumed&#13;
to be 20 tons per hectare and increasing at 2% per annum./l&#13;
1.12      This method of estimating fruit and vegetable production relies&#13;
upon limited data of dubious reliability. Fruit and vegetable production is&#13;
probably understated by the reported Chinese figures. Private plot&#13;
production of vegetables and the cultivation and collection of fruits&#13;
and vegetables on noncommine lands (hillsides, wasteland, etc.) are not&#13;
accurately reflected in the Chinese figures. The constant 2% growth rate&#13;
assumption, smoothes over fluctuations in production due to weather and,&#13;
more importantly, due to political influences. Specifically, the&#13;
elimination of private plots during the Great Leap Forward and during the&#13;
Cultural Revolution no doubt had a negative impact on fruit and vegetable&#13;
production which has not been recorded in the food balance sheets./2&#13;
/1 The Ho et al., study used a 20 tons per hectare yield figure and a per&#13;
annum growth rate of 1.5%. The 2% per annum growth rate used in this&#13;
study primarily represents the increase in multiple cropping and&#13;
continuous cultivation (in Southern China) and implies little or no&#13;
growth in yield per cultivated hectare. These figures correspond&#13;
closely with those reported in Donald L. Plucknett and Halsey L. Beemer&#13;
eds., Vegetable Farming Systems in China, (Boulder, Colorado, Westview&#13;
Press, 1981) pps. 293-301. The resulting 1981 yield figure is still&#13;
less than half the Chinese Government's yield goal of 75 tons per&#13;
hectare. The corresponding vegetable consumption figures, furthermore,&#13;
are also still well below the target of 0.5 kg per capita per day.&#13;
/2 The same constant per annum growth rate assumption of 2% is also made&#13;
for poultry, eggs, milk, and rabbit meat production. The 2% figure&#13;
approximates population growth during the last 30 years and, therefore,&#13;
nullifies any trends in per capita production of poultry, eggs, milk and&#13;
rabbit which may have occurred over time. While there most certainly&#13;
were trends in the per capita production of these commodities, our near&#13;
complete ignorance of these trends justifies the use of the neutralizing&#13;
2% growth rate. In effect, then, the likely fall in poultry, eggs, and&#13;
rabbit production during the 1960s is masked by the constant growth&#13;
assumption.&#13;

1.13      Animal Products.   Production time series for most of the seven&#13;
animal product commodities are unreliable, for selected years only, or&#13;
completely unavailable. The exception to the rule is the complete time&#13;
series for aquatic products (fish and shellfish from fresh and salt water&#13;
sources). The Chinese have also released data for pork, beef and mutton&#13;
production for six of the 31 years under study. Population series for swine,&#13;
cattle, and sheep and goats are available for all years. The 1981 Chinese&#13;
Statistical Yearbook provides the number of pigs slaughtered in each year&#13;
1952 to 1981. The animal and slaughtered animal population time series were&#13;
converted to a pork, beef, and mutton production time series in accordance&#13;
vith the population to meat ratios observed for selected years data and&#13;
numerous assumed coefficients for slaughter rate, animal weight, and carcass&#13;
lressing percentage. The data for fish and red meat production are&#13;
-onsidered to be reasonably accurate and together these two products&#13;

1.15      Pork consumption greatly exceeds both beef and mutton /1&#13;
consumption, and comprises about 90% of China's yearly red meat consumption.&#13;
Fortunately, relatively good information is available on slaughter rates,&#13;
live weights, and dressing weights for China's swine. These coefficients&#13;
have changed over time and specific estimates are required for each of&#13;
several periods. Slaughter rates for China's pig inventory are as specified&#13;
by the official time series of pigs slaughtered. Swine live weights&#13;
decrease from 78 kg in the 1950s but are assumed to surpass this level by&#13;
1980. Swine are assumed to dress out at 67% of liveweight (65% of&#13;
liveweight during 1960-78 to correct for the different composition of body&#13;
weight in lighter pigs).&#13;
1.16      The time series released for cattle population includes both&#13;
cattle and buffalo./2 Both of these animals are used extensively in China&#13;
for draft power and only to a minor extent for dairy and meat production.&#13;
Dairy herd figures are scarce and beef cattle herd figures are also&#13;
unavailable. Beef production figures are, consequently, subject to a&#13;
considerable margin of error. Beef consumption is only a very small part&#13;
(3-5%) of total red meat consumption in China.&#13;
1.17      Slaughter rates for cattle (and other large animals) are estimated&#13;
to lie beween 5% and 10% of herd population. Such a low rate is consistent&#13;
with the reluctance to slaughter cattle prior to exhaustion of work&#13;
capacity. Even with very conservative estimates of live weights and&#13;
dressing weight, the greatest slaughter rate compatible with available beef&#13;
production figures was 4%./3 Cattle are presumed to dress out at 35% of&#13;
liveweight and to weigh 225 kg (slightly higher during the 1950s).&#13;
1.18      Information on China's sheep and goats is only marginally better&#13;
than that on cattle. The fairly conservative assumptions of a 30% slaughter&#13;
rate, 27 kg liveweight per animal (30 kg during the 1950s), and a dressing&#13;
weight of 35% of liveweight were found to approximate available production&#13;
figures for mutton.&#13;
/1 Mutton includes meat from both goats and sheep.&#13;
/2 Cattle population figures for the years 1966-69 are not available.&#13;
The missing values have been interpolated from the 1965 and 1970&#13;
populations.&#13;
/3 Slaughter rates for large animals in Hebei are reported to be 2.9%.&#13;

1.19      Poultry and Eggs.   The most extensive gap in the animal product&#13;
data is the absence of poultry and egg production data.    This Lack of data&#13;
is to be expected given that up to 95% of rural poultry is privately pro-&#13;
duced.  Previous Western estimates of China's poultry population had put the&#13;
population at between 1.4 and 1.6 billion birds. The Chinese nlow estimate&#13;
1980 poultry population as exceeding 800 million birds. The figure of 850&#13;
million birds in the year 1979 has been arbitrarily adopted in this study.&#13;
Seventy percent of the 'birds are assumed to be chickens weighing 1.6 kg and&#13;
30% to be ducks, geese, etc. weighing 2.7 kg. The birds are assumed to&#13;
yield 75% of their weight as ready to cook meat and are subject: to an 80%&#13;
slaughter rate./l   Poultry population is presumed to be growing at 2% per&#13;
annum.  The State Statistical Bureau has estimated per capita egg consumption&#13;
to have been 1.5 kg in 1978 and 2.14 kg in 1981./2 Total 1981 and 1978 egg&#13;
production figures have been calculated from these consumption figures.&#13;
1979 and 1980 egg production figures were then interpolated from the 1978&#13;
and 1981 values. FinalLy, egg produc:tion is assumed to have been growing at&#13;
2% per annum prior to 1978.&#13;
1.20      Other Meats.   The only other meats of any significance at the&#13;
national level are rabb:Lt meat and meats of large animals other than cattle&#13;
and buffalo (e.g., horses, camels). The bulk of rabbit meat production is a&#13;
by-product of rabbit fur production and a large part, perhaps most, of the&#13;
rabbit meat is exported to Europe and the U.S. Rabbit meat production is&#13;
estimated to be twice rabbit meat exports during the period 1976-81 for which&#13;
rabbit meat exports have been reported. Rabbit meat production is presumed to&#13;
have been increasing at 2% per annum prior to 1976. Large animal populations&#13;
(other than cattle and buffalo) are calculated from the available total&#13;
large animals time series./3    Large animals are assumed to have the&#13;
same liveweight, slaughter rate, and meat yield as cattle did in the period&#13;
1949-59 (see Table 8). The sum of other large animal and rabbit meats&#13;
production is recorded as "other meats" in the food balance sheets.&#13;
/1  Poultry slaughter rates in Rebei are reported to be 48%.    See Staff&#13;
Appraisal Report, China, Hebei Agricultural Development Project&#13;
(Report No. 3855-CHA, May 17, 1982, Projects Dept., EAP), p. 73.&#13;
Though extremely low by Western standards, the 80% figure must be&#13;
viewed as an upper bound for the true slaughter rate for Chinese poultry.&#13;

1.21      Milk.   The Chinese have reported milk output (including cow,&#13;
buffalo, and goat milk) for 1978 to 1981./1 A 2% growth figure has been&#13;
assumed for all other years.&#13;
1.22      Animal Fats.   Animal fat has been calculated at 6% of the&#13;
liveweight of the slaughtered swine, large animal, and sheep and goat&#13;
populations. The animal fat recovered per animal slaughtered is the product&#13;
of the liveweight (recorded in Table 8) and the coefficient 0.06&#13;
(representing the percentage of liveweight which is trimmed off as fat).&#13;
II. TRADE DATA&#13;
2.01      Reasonably accurate agricultural trade data exist for China for&#13;
the period 1950-81. Trade figures are compiled from the FAQ Trade Yearbooks&#13;
(and other sources)./2 Imports from and exports to China for all reporting&#13;
countries are summed to derive estimates of China-s yearly trade.    Trade&#13;
with nonreporting countries (most notably other communist countries of Asia&#13;
during the 1950s) are not represented and, therefore, the total trade figures&#13;
understate actual trade to some degree. The FAO Trade Yearbooks for the&#13;
1970s include Taiwan's trade data in China's trade figures. As Taiwan's&#13;
production and trade figures have been excluded from all other segments of&#13;
the FBSs, Taiwan's trade figures for the 1970s have also been deducted from&#13;
the FAO's trade figures for China.&#13;
2.02      Notable gaps exist in the trade data for the early 1950s, 1970, and&#13;
1981. Fortunately, these gaps relate to the less significant commodities.&#13;
Data for China's trade in aquatic products for years other than 1976 to 1981&#13;
would be useful, for instance, but the net impact of inclusion of such data&#13;
would be a drop in daily per capita energy availability of less than 1 KCal.&#13;

III. PROCESSING AND UTILIZATION&#13;
3.01      A considerable amount of China's domestic supply of the 21&#13;
commodities recorded in the food balance sheets is lost or diverted from&#13;
human consumption during transportation, storage, processing and through&#13;
alternative end uses. 'The losses due to seed requirements, use as livestock&#13;
feed, use for nonfood manufacturing, waste, dehusking and processing into&#13;
flour or oil is summed and entered into the food balance sheets as column V,&#13;
Nonfood &amp; Waste. The di:fference between domestic supply (column IV) and&#13;
nonfood and waste is the amount available for human consumption and is&#13;
entered as column VI, Food. Seed requirements, feed use, manufacturing&#13;
requirements, waste, and losses during processing are detailed below.&#13;
3.02      Seed.   FAO figures for seed requirements in China /1 are consistent&#13;
with fragmentary data from the World Bank's North China Plain and Hebei&#13;
Agricultural Projects. Seed requirements specified in these sources are&#13;
recorded in columns 1-3 of Table 11. The seed requirements used in this&#13;
study rely on these three sources and other technical information./2&#13;
3.03      Feedgrain Requirements for Livestock.    China's livestock is an&#13;
integral part of the agricultural system and supply draft power, meat, manure,&#13;
milk and other important: outputs. Livestock also consume a significant&#13;
portion of agricultural production. Production of meat and milk is entered&#13;
directly into the FBSs while consumption of food grains by livestock is&#13;
subtracted from food gra!in supply (i.e., feedgrains are entered into column V&#13;
of the food balance sheets). The quantity of grain which is fed to livestock&#13;
is estimated by a livestock feeding model. Livestock feeding systems vary&#13;
greatly by season and by region, however, and a feeding model can only roughly&#13;
approximate national feed requirements in accordance with sketchy data.&#13;
China's livestock have elsewhere been estimated to consume between 7 and 11%&#13;

of total grain production directly in the form of grain and greater than 20%&#13;
directly and indirectly as concentrates (grain and grain byproducts)./l&#13;
3.04      The livestock feeding model used in this study derives feed grain&#13;
requirements as the resiLdual between concentrate requirements and the&#13;
availability of grain mitllings, oilseed cake, and all other high nutrient&#13;
value food byproducts. The model is adopted from the model developed by&#13;
Dawson./2 Swine concenl:rate requirements are assumed to be 1.2 kg&#13;
concentrate per year for each kg of average liveweight./3  The concentrate&#13;
requirement is upped to 1.5 kg for 1979 to 1981 to reflect the recent&#13;
emphasis upon increased concentrate consumption in swine production. The&#13;
per pig yearly concentrnte requirements range between 82.8 and 123 kg.&#13;
These estimates are somewhat greater than the corresponding figures derived&#13;
by Dawson and Wiens, bul: are still very low by world standards. Dawson's&#13;
figure of 30 kg concentrate requirement per sheep and per goat seems&#13;
reasonable given the abiLlity of these animals to survive on coarser foods.&#13;
A figure of 350 kg of concentrate consumption per head is assumed for large&#13;
animals. This figure it} substantially less than Dawson's figure of 600 kg,&#13;
but is consistent with average weight of large animals (cattle) specified in&#13;
the beef production model above. Animal concentrate requirements for swine,&#13;
sheep and goats, and large animals are presented in Table 12. Total&#13;
concentrate requirementi: (the product of animal population and per animal&#13;
requirements) are presented in Table 13.&#13;
/1  The Chinese classify animal feeds as concentrates (grains, grain&#13;
millings and other byproducts, oilseed cake), forage (grasses, weeds,&#13;
leaves, etc.), or roughage (stalks and straw). Livestock feeding&#13;
systems rely heavily, relative to Western standards, on forage and&#13;
roughage. Such feeding regimens minimize consumption of foodgrains&#13;
which might otherwit;e be consumed by humans at the expense of reduced&#13;
animal size and slaughter rates. The Chinese are intimately aware of&#13;
this trade-off between slaughter rates and the supply of foodgrain&#13;
available for human consumption. The policy of increased concentrate&#13;
consumption by Chinn's livestock was discussed in the late 1970s, but&#13;
was subsequently sutipended due to the lack of growth of grain production&#13;
in 1980.&#13;

3.05      Grain millings and oilseed cake availability at the national level&#13;
is a function of grain and oilseed production, the proportion of the grain&#13;
and oilseed crop which is milled or pressed, and the proportion of the&#13;
processed crop which remains as an edible byproduct. Accounting for seed,&#13;
non-food manufacturing, and feed requirements and waste, it is calculated&#13;
that roughly 90% of the rice crop, 80% of the wheat crop, and 60% of coarse&#13;
grains (including corn) are milled. Milling results in 12% bran, grain&#13;
fragments and other edible milling byproducts for rice /1 and coarse grains&#13;
and 13% for wheat.   Crush and extraction rates for soybeans, peanuts and&#13;
rapeseed are as specified in Table 1 (sesameseed and sunflowerseed cake are&#13;
not calculated; cottonseed cake is used as fertilizer in China).    Oilseed&#13;
zake production rates are the reciprocal of the extraction rates minus a&#13;
s;mall amount of waste (e.g., 87% of crushed soybeans will remain as oilseed&#13;
cake).  Grain millings and oilseed cake production figures for selected&#13;
rears are presented in Table 14.&#13;
3.06      The difference between concentrate requirements and availability of&#13;
grain millings, oilseed cake, etc. equals the amount of grain required as feed&#13;
lor the livestock sector.   This difference is presented in column 3 of Table&#13;
15 in absolute terms and &lt;1s a percentage of total grain production in column&#13;
i..  Very little is known as to which of the grains produced in China are fed&#13;
to livestock. This study presumes that the bulk of feed grains are coarse&#13;
g;rains and that only very minor percentages of the rice and wheat: crop are fed&#13;
to livestock. The figure of 25% of coarse grain production (excluding soybean&#13;
and pulse production) (column 5 of Table 15) has arbitrarily been adopted in&#13;
this study as the percentage of coarse grains fed to livestock. The 25%&#13;
figure is increased to 28% in 1979 to reflect the increased consumption of&#13;
concentrates. If an additional 1% of the rice crop and 3% of the wheat crop&#13;
(column 6 of Table 15) is fed to livestock, the concentrate requirements are&#13;
just covered by concentrate availability.&#13;
/I These percentages are substantially less than those used by Dawson.&#13;
Dawson's figure of 22% milling byproducts is much too high and implies&#13;
the inclusion of considerable quantities of rice husks. Rice husks&#13;
are of nominal nutritional value and, due to their abrasive texture,&#13;
should not be consumed in large quantities by livestock.    Chinese rice&#13;
milling equipment can separate much of the husk from the bran:, so it seems&#13;
safe to presume that tlhe Chinese use rice husks primarily as fuel or&#13;
construction materials. The 12% rice milling byproducts figure, then,&#13;
is primarily composed of rice bran with only a minor component: of&#13;
husk.&#13;

3.07      It would have been possible to repeat this process for all years&#13;
under study and compute the rice, wheat, and coarse grain requirements for&#13;
each of the years. Such a procedure implicitly suggests a level of accuracy&#13;
which is not justified by the available data. Instead, the 1% (rice), 3%&#13;
(wheat) and 25% (coarse grains; 28% of coarse grains beginning in 1979)&#13;
figures have been used for all years. These feedgrain use coefficients are&#13;
entered as column 7 of Table 11.&#13;
3.08      Nonfood Manufacturing. Little information is available regarding&#13;
the use of unprocessed food for nonfood manufacturing in China. The&#13;
:oefficients for nonfood manufacturing requirements in FAO's Provisional Food&#13;
3alance Sheets (1972-74 Av'erage) for China for rice, wheat, corn, cottonseed&#13;
and sunflower oils, and animal fats have been adopted for use in this study.&#13;
All other coefficients are assumed to be negligible (see column 8 of&#13;
Table 11).&#13;
3.09      Waste. Inadequate or inferior storage and handling facilities&#13;
atill cause extensive los8 of China's food production. It is important to&#13;
^emember, however, that waste is not always easy to define in the Chinese&#13;
agricultural context. A fresh vegetable enterprise in Youngstang Commune,&#13;
for instance, "loses" 50% of raw materials during storage but all of the&#13;
Losses are used as pig feed. Refrigerated storage capacity is particularly&#13;
:inadequate. The FAO ProvLsional Food Balance Sheets (1972-74 Average) use&#13;
a 3% waste figure for graLns and a 5% figure for vegetables. These figures&#13;
are based on world averages and are presumably adjusted for storage and&#13;
miarketing facilities avai:Lable. Vaclav Smil uses a figure of 4% waste for&#13;
grains (and 10% for tubers, fruit, and vegetable waste) and still considers&#13;
t:hese to be-conservative estimates./l The present study has adopted the&#13;
conservative 3% figure for all commodities except fruits, vegetables, and&#13;
tubers (10%), sugar (2%), and fish, eggs, and milk (5%)./2 These waste&#13;
coefficients are entered as column 9 of Table 11.-&#13;
'.10      Extraction Ratesi (Grains, Vegetable Oils, Sugar). Extraction&#13;
r ates obtaining in any givren year are a function of a number of factors&#13;
including the machinery utilized, the degree of refinement, and oil and&#13;
glucose content of the raw materials. These factors vary both between years&#13;
/1 See Smil, V.', "China's Food: Availability, Requirements, Composition,&#13;
Prospects op. cit.," pp. 68-69.&#13;
/2 Breakage rates for eggs during transportation alone probably exceed 5%,&#13;
so the waste coefficients for fish, eggs, and milk are also probably&#13;
somewhat conservative. See Animal Agriculture in China, CSCPRC Report&#13;
11 (Washington, D.C., National Academy of Sciences Press, 1980), p. 30.&#13;

and between locality so that there is considerable variation in extraction&#13;
rates across time and locality. Extraction rates for vegetable oils and&#13;
sugar have been specified above and are conservative estimates generally&#13;
somewhat below world levels. The estimated extraction rates for vegetable&#13;
oils and sugar are consistent with the selected year data for vegetable oil&#13;
and sugar production, fragmentary information on extraction rates obtaining&#13;
in the PRC, as well as various technical data.&#13;
3.11      Extraction rates for rice, wheat and corn (70%, 85%, and 91%&#13;
respectively) used by Ho et al. may be somewhat optimistic (upper bound)&#13;
estimates of the true extraction rates for these cereals. Most brigades&#13;
have custom milling capacity for their own grains so that flour production&#13;
is quite decentralized and extraction rates vary greatly across locality.&#13;
Only China's most modern rice milling equipment could achieve the 70%&#13;
extraction rate reported to the World Bank./l (Rice is composed of 70% rice&#13;
grain, 22% husk, and 8% bran.) The bulk of China's paddy is milled by steel&#13;
hullers and disk shellers with extraction rates closer to 63 and 67%./2 The&#13;
85% extraction rate for wheat reported to the World Bank falls within the&#13;
range of 83 to 92% extraction as reported by the 1976 American Wheat Studies&#13;
Delegation /3 and the 65 to 83% range observed by the 1978 China Rural&#13;
Processing Technology Study tour./4   The 85% extraction rate figure also&#13;
seems quite reasonable given the higher fiber content of China's wheat&#13;
flour./5 The 91% extraction rate for corn reported to the World Bank, and&#13;
an extraction rate of 80% for sorghum and millet have been adopted./6    These&#13;
dehusking, milling, and crushing coefficients are entered as column 12 of&#13;
Table 11. In all cases flour milling byproducts (bran, germ, etc.) are&#13;
carefully conserved for fuel, vegetable oil processing, animal feed, etc.&#13;

3.12      Total Food Disappearance.    The sum of the food disappearance from&#13;
these end uses and waste as detailed above is calculated as (1) percentage&#13;
seed requirements times domestic production plus (2) domestic supply times&#13;
percentage feed, nonfood manufacturing, and waste requirements plus (3) the&#13;
residual of domestic supply minus the losses above (i.e., quantities 1 and&#13;
2) times the percentage losses due to dehusking (rice), flour milling&#13;
(grains), or crushing (soybeans and peanuts).    This may be expressed for&#13;
commodity i in year j as:&#13;
FDij = (DPi )(si) + (DSi )(fij + ni + wi) +&#13;
[((DSij) - [(])Pii(si) + (DSiij(fij + ni + wi)])(pi)]&#13;
where:&#13;

            Trends in food and nutrient availability in

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Agricultural production and trade data
            recently released from China are the basis of this
            assessment of per capita nutrient availablity in China over
            time and by province. This large body of data has been
            compiled into national level food balance sheets for the
            period 1950-1981 and provincial nutrient production figures
            for 1979-80. Despite limited knowledge of production, trade,
            utilization and nutrient composition for some foods for some
            years, the food balance sheets present a comprehensive
            picture of nutrient availability for each year and of trends
            in nutrient availability over time and by province. China
            seems likely to be able to maintain present favorable levels
            of per capita nutrient availability during the 1980s. Per
            capita average nutrient availability differs greatly by
            province. Several Northwestern and Southwestern provinces
            were below national average nutrient availability levels in
            1979-80. Special efforts will be required to improve
            agricultural productivity and nutritional status in these
            areas during the 1980s.
