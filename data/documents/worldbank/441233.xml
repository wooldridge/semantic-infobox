            Franchising telecom service shops : meeting
            demand from nonsubscribers in Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Indonesia has only about 1.3 lines per
            hundred people, so universal telephone service cannot be
            practically achieved in the near future. Nevertheless,
            public access to telephone and other telecommunications
            services can be dramatically improved through pay phones and
            telecom shops. The telecom shops are retail outlets that
            provide telecom services to "non-subscribers,"
            often under a franchise from the local telephone company.
            These shops have turned out to be effective at meeting the
            strong demand among the majority of Indonesians who lack
            private residential or business telephone service, and their
            success provides a model that other countries can apply. The
            important message from the Indonesian experience is that the
            demand for service from nonsubscribers in developing
            countries is significant, commercially viable, and should be
            met. The rapid growth in the number of telecom shops in
            Indonesia attests to their increasingly effective role in
            providing public access to telecommunications services. As
            technology advances and the cost of telecommunications
            equipment declines, the next commercial development could be
            the establishment of community "micro" telephone
            companies. Using a small PBX (an automatic switchboard), a
            telecom shop could cost-effectively service one hundred
            extensions on twenty main lines and, using the new
            generation of digital cordless telephone sets, the telecom
            shop could extend its services while still providing
            conventional telecommunications shop services.
