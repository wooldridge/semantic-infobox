Attachment 1&#13;
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative Charter&#13;
Adopted on July 6,2007 and amended on July 11, 2013&#13;
(provided for informational purposes only)&#13;
1.     Introduction&#13;
1.1    The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD") and the International&#13;
Development Association ("IDA") (collectively, the "Bank"), the International Monetary Fund ("IMF")&#13;
and all donors ("Donors") to one or more trust funds (collectively, the "Trust Fund") for the Financial&#13;
Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative ("FIRST") have adopted the present charter (the "Charter").&#13;
1.2    Launched in 2002, FIRST is a collaborative arrangement providing for a technical assistance&#13;
("TA") facility designed to support growth and poverty reduction in low- and middle-income countries by&#13;
promoting stable, deep and diverse financial sectors. The FIRST arrangement is built upon close&#13;
collaboration between the Bank and the IMF, both to leverage institutional expertise, and as the designated&#13;
implementing agencies for FIRST TA. This arrangement also seeks to promote collaboration among a&#13;
wide range of institutions, including other bilateral agencies and multilateral development banks.&#13;
1.3    The Charter sets out the governance arrangements of FIRST that encapsulate this collaborative&#13;
arrangement.&#13;
2.     Basic Principles&#13;
2.1    Following are basic principles that will guide FIRST (the "Basic Principles"):&#13;
2.1.1  A demand-driven approach with open access&#13;
FIRST aims to be demand-driven and open in its approach, as a strong advocate of financial sector&#13;
development, and seeks to identify effective new ideas and modalities in the delivery of TA. To this end,&#13;
FIRST accepts technical assistance requests from a wide range of sources for the benefit of client&#13;
countries. As the designated implementing entities, the Bank and the IMF will prepare funding proposals&#13;
to be considered for FIRST financing.&#13;
2.1.2 Additionality&#13;
FIRST seeks to ensure that it funds activities that are complementary to those being funded from other&#13;
sources and that its funding does not substitute for or displace more suitable or appropriate assistance&#13;
available from other sources. FIRST seeks to excel in efforts to promote learning and knowledge sharing&#13;
in the area of financial sector TA.&#13;
2.1.3 Harmonization, transparency, and accountability&#13;
FIRST promotes a model of partnership in line with the principles of: ownership, alignment,&#13;
harmonization, managing for results and mutual accountability. For FIRST, this involves introducing clear&#13;
accountabilities in program management, setting targets, assessing effectiveness, and monitoring results.&#13;
FIRST's partnership model also seeks to promote learning and knowledge sharing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-&#13;
2.1.4 TA Beneficiaries&#13;
(a)    Beneficiaries of FIRST TA are policy makers, regulatory bodies, government agencies,&#13;
international financial institutions, and, under limited circumstances, quasi-public institutions (such as&#13;
self-regulatory organizations and industry associations).&#13;
(b)    Beneficiaries of FIRST assistance must be from either low- or middle-income countries at the time&#13;
project proposals receive final approval. "Low-income countries" are those defined by the Bank as eligible&#13;
to receive low or no interest credits or grants from IDA. "Middle-income countries" are those defined by&#13;
the Bank as eligible to receive IBRD financing.&#13;
3.     Objectives&#13;
3.1    FIRST's overall objective is to help strengthen financial systems in low- and middle-income&#13;
countries so that they make a strong and positive contribution to economic growth and help reduce poverty&#13;
and income inequality. FIRST's activities are currently only those financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    FIRST's specific areas of focus are to:&#13;
3.2.1  Finance TA in the areas of financial sector regulation, supervision and development in response to&#13;
country demands, provide support to countries to strengthen their financial systems or implement&#13;
standards and codes in advance of Financial Sector Assessment Programs ("FSAPs") or Reports on&#13;
Standards and Codes ("ROSCs"), and facilitate systematic follow-up of related recommendations.&#13;
3.2.2  Advise on the preparation and implementation of action plans, development programs and reforms&#13;
in the financial sector.&#13;
3.2.3  Promote coordination in the delivery of financial sector TA and capacity building, drawing&#13;
particularly on private sector expertise.&#13;
3.2.4  Support research on and the dissemination of best practices and useful tools related to financial&#13;
sector reform and development in low- and middle-income countries.&#13;
3.2.5  Work with international standard-setting bodies and other relevant partners to broaden the base of&#13;
providers supporting countries' efforts to implement standards and codes in accordance with FSAP and&#13;
ROSC recommendations and strengthen their financial systems.&#13;

"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank&#13;
on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies&#13;
as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion.&#13;

ï»¿- 12 -&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust&#13;
funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund&#13;
to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;
amount equal to two percent (2 %) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration Agreements in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis&#13;
up to a maximum of eleven point seventy six percent (11.76%) of the total Contributions under all&#13;
Administration Agreements. The Donors acknowledge and agree that such costs will be approved each&#13;
year on the basis of annual budget amounts presented to the Governing Council.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund&#13;
Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right&#13;
to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be&#13;
applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing&#13;
Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Transfers to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)&#13;
4.1    The Bank shall enter into a transfer agreement (the "Transfer Agreement") with the IMF to set&#13;
forth the terms and conditions of any Trust Fund funds transferred to them. Following the transfer of funds&#13;
by the Bank from the Trust Fund to the IMF (the "Transferred Funds"), IMF shall be responsible for the&#13;
use of such funds, and the Bank shall have no further responsibility with respect of such funds.&#13;
4.2    The Donors acknowledge and agree that the Bank has no responsibility, under the Administration&#13;
Agreement or otherwise for: (i) the use of the Transferred Funds; (ii) the implementing, monitoring,&#13;
supervising, evaluating, or providing quality assurance for activities financed by the Transferred Funds;&#13;
(ii) providing Donors with financial, progress, results or impact reporting for activities financed by the&#13;
Transferred Funds; and (iii) any misuse or misprocurement with respect to the Transferred Funds; or (iv)&#13;
pursuing any Donor interests or IMF undertakings with respect to the Transferred Funds.&#13;
4.3    The Donors further acknowledge and agree that any financial reports with respect to the Trust&#13;
Fund funds transferred to the IMF and the reports with respect to the progress of the implementation of&#13;
IMF activities are the responsibility of the IMF.&#13;
5.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
5.1    The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds deposited in&#13;
the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;

5.2    The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the World&#13;
Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all commitments and&#13;
liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial&#13;
information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to&#13;
the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center&#13;
secure website.&#13;
5.3    The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;
website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit report,&#13;
comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors&#13;
concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust&#13;
funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the&#13;
Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
5.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange&#13;
for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect&#13;
to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
6.     Progress Reportine&#13;
6.1    The Bank shall provide the Donors with annual reports on the progress of activities financed by&#13;
the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as defined below), the Bank shall&#13;
furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to six (6)&#13;
months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on the scope and&#13;
conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits&#13;
of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the&#13;
Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute&#13;
a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
7.     Disbursement: Cancellation; Refund&#13;
7.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;
May 31, 2018 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to&#13;
the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreements&#13;
of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of&#13;
the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective&#13;
Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by&#13;
such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding&#13;
Currency amounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 14 -&#13;
7.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all or&#13;
any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions (paid and&#13;
not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the Bank and any&#13;
consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any&#13;
Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return&#13;
to the Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement;&#13;
unless otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
8.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;

Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and&#13;
such related information.&#13;

claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
