1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   China's economic reforms, initiated in 1978, were followed by rapid economic&#13;
growth. The next critical step in the development of a market economy is the deepening&#13;
of state-owned enterprises (SOE) reform, an area where other reforms-price, fiscal,&#13;
financial, trade, investment, planning, legal, social and labor-interact. In November&#13;
1993, the Government announced a wide ranging reform program aimed at selected SOEs&#13;
and 18 Municipalities. The experiment includes the adoption of new accounting&#13;
standards, asset evaluation techniques and administrative regulations, corporatization, and&#13;
comprehensive SOE restructuring, bankruptcy and divestiture of social services by the&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
1.2   One of the obstacles to accelerating enterprise reform is the existence of large&#13;
numbers of surplus workers in these enterprises. Of the 112 million workers employed in&#13;
SOEs in 1994, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) estimates that 15 percent are redundant and&#13;
the number is expected to rise. The pace of labor redeployment, however, is also slowed&#13;
by the role enterprises have played in the delivery of basic social services such as&#13;
housing, pensions and medical benefits. The absence of alternative social institutions for&#13;
delivering these services has forced the Government to restrict enterprises from laying off&#13;
redundant labor. Limited supporting employment services and lack of appropriate&#13;
training programs for new skills have also significantly affected the pace of labor market&#13;
development and mobility. Ongoing social and policy reforms addressing these issues&#13;
will in the future give enterprises more discretion in redeploying surplus labor.&#13;
1.3   To assist China's effort in SOE reform, the Bank has provided assistance through&#13;
economic and sector work and financing of investments to support restructuring and labor&#13;
mobility. Various studies have outlined an SOE reform strategy framework, identified&#13;
policy options to promote the development of the labor market and the strategy for&#13;
meeting the growing demand for skilled labor. In collaboration with key Government&#13;
agencies, the Bank has undertaken an in-depth review of SOEs in selected municipalities.&#13;
In addition, a joint Government and Bank conference was held in Beijing in June 1995 to&#13;
review the Government's policy options for enterprise reform.  The Bank is also&#13;
supporting the Government's effort in piloting housing and industrial reforms and the&#13;
development of a social security system.&#13;
1.4   The proposed pilot project, aimed at the development of a labor market to&#13;
promote labor mobility, complements the Bank's ongoing assistance to SOE reform. The&#13;
proposed project was jointly prepared by the MOL and the five pilot municipalities (PMs)&#13;
including Deyang, Guangzhou, Shaoxing with Zhejiang Province, Weifang and Wuhan&#13;
(one of the 18 selected municipalities for comprehensive reform) with assistance of the&#13;
Bank Group (See attached map). A Project Implementation Plan (PIP), from which key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
elements are presented in Annex 1, was prepared by the MOL and was reviewed in&#13;
Washington with the representatives of the MOL and formed the basis for appraisal in&#13;
July 1995.&#13;

2. THE LABOR MARKET&#13;
A. LABOR FORCE PROFILE&#13;
2.1    China's labor force is predominately rural. Out of a total labor supply of 620&#13;
million in 1994, 447 million were employed in rural areas of which most were engaged in&#13;
agriculture. In urban areas, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and collectives' continue to&#13;
provide the great majority of jobs, and in 1993 accounted for 86 percent of urban&#13;
employment. Statistically measured, unemployment is low by international standards at&#13;
only 2.9 percent of the urban labor force in 1994-but, as demonstrated below,&#13;
underemployment is much more severe.&#13;
2.2   In total, labor supply and demand growth rates closely matched each other since&#13;
1980, and the unemployment rate remained reasonably stable at a low level. There were,&#13;
however, significant shifts in the composition of labor demand.  In rural areas,&#13;
liberalization of nonagricultural activities led to tremendous growth in off-farm&#13;
employment in rural enterprises, and the share of such activities at the national level rose&#13;
from 8.3 percent in 1980 to 24.2 percent by 1994. This was accompanied by a further&#13;
shift in the allocation of labor within agriculture in favor of small-scale farming and away&#13;
from agricultural collectives. In urban areas, an increased emphasis on growth in the&#13;
private sector encouraged a shift in the composition of employment away from SOEs and&#13;
collective-owned enterprises (COEs) and towards privately-owned and joint venture&#13;
enterprises and self-employment. ln 1980, the urban private sector (private enterprises&#13;
and self employment) accounted for less than 0.2 percent of total employment in China,&#13;
but by 1994, this had grown to 3.7 percent. Table 2.1 presents China's labor force and&#13;
employment profile.&#13;
2.3    These trends hide two major features of the Chinese labor market. First, there is&#13;
substantial degree of underemployment.  This takes two forms, large numbers of&#13;
redundant workers in SOEs and COEs in urban areas and large and growing surplus labor&#13;
within agriculture. Second, severe shortages of skilled workers have developed in the&#13;
cities, and the Township and Village Enterprises (TVEs) are also short of skilled labor.&#13;
The labor market is thus characterized by an excess supply of unskilled workers&#13;
and an excess demand for skilled labor.&#13;
China has three types of enterprises: state-owned (SOEs); collective-owned (COEs); and privately owned.&#13;
Technically, COEs are owned by the employees, but are, in practice, administered by lower-level tiers of&#13;
government. For most practical purposes the distinction between SOEs and COEs has become highly blurred,&#13;
although SOEs still tend to be larger, more capital-intensive and more diversified than COEs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
2.4    Public enterprises in China are overstaffed. MOL's estimates indicate that, in the&#13;
SOEs, at least 15 percent of their work force or 16.8 million employees could be made&#13;
redundant with little or no impact on productive capacity. It is further estimated that&#13;
about 80 percent of SOEs have a labor surplus ranging between 15 and 80 percent of their&#13;
employment levels with only a few SOEs having 80 percent. There is also an unknown&#13;
number of surplus workers in COEs. This is not a new development, as overstaffing in&#13;
public enterprises arose in the pre-reform system when enterprises had an obligation to&#13;
hire workers as directed by the Government. However, as public enterprises were&#13;
increasingly evaluated on the basis of the commercial performance faced by enterprises in&#13;
a market economy, the level of redundancy among their work forces became more and&#13;
more apparent. Reforms in the 1 980s did little to change the situation, as managers still&#13;
faced soft budget constraints, and could maintain overstaffing levels, but more recent&#13;
moves to expose SOEs to commercial criteria mean that the continued employment of&#13;
redundant workers will become impossible without further subsidies. This problem,&#13;
while less visible in the past, may have worsened as employment in the SOEs and COEs&#13;
continued to grow  in the 1980s and 1990s, despite increasing access to labor-saving&#13;
technology from abroad in many industries. Recently, state enterprises have laid-off&#13;
surplus workers at lower pay. If the number of surplus workers in SOEs were added to&#13;
official estimates of urban unemployment, the measured unemployment rate would rise&#13;
drastically to about 11.5 percent.&#13;

2.5    Despite a doubling of agricultural output in 1980-93, there remains considerable&#13;
2&#13;
surplus labor in agriculture.  When applying the labor requirements approach , the&#13;
Chinese authorities estimate that about 30 percent of agricultural labor is surplus.&#13;
2.6    Shortages of skilled workers have emerged following rapid growth in the&#13;
economy over the past decade. National trends are reflected to different degrees in the&#13;
experience of the five cities selected for the proposed pilot project. Of the five, only&#13;
Guangzhou, situated in a rapidly growing area in Southern China, is in the enviable&#13;
position of finding labor demand growing faster than supply after adjusting for growth of&#13;
surplus workers in enterprises and rural areas. Guangzhou's fast growing economy is&#13;
experiencing a rapid reduction of rural surplus workers as they are absorbed into urban&#13;
and off-farm rural activities. All five cities however, are experiencing difficulties in&#13;
redeploying redundant workers from state enterprises. Even in Guangzhou, where GDP&#13;
growth of 13 percent a year is rapidly opening up new jobs, it is not easy to provide&#13;
redundant workers with the skills needed to compete in the local labor market. Skill&#13;
shortages are emerging in all five cities given growing industrial demand for skilled&#13;
labor.&#13;
B. LABOR MOBILITY&#13;
2.7    The current policy regarding the disposition of surplus workers still emphasizes&#13;
maintaining  social stability.   In  implementing  reform  measures, therefore, local&#13;
governments must carefully monitor the socially affordable level of unemployment in&#13;
light of the strength of the local economy. Government policy makers recognize that this&#13;
is inefficient, but the social security system is not yet adequately developed to handle&#13;
significantly larger open unemployment rates. Moreover, labor mobility is restricted by&#13;
residence permit requirements, enterprise-based basic social services, limited&#13;
employment services, and lack of training programs to meet the demand for new skills.&#13;
However, due to growing labor shortages particularly in the fast growing coastal regions&#13;
of China, the urban registration requirements is not strictly enforced leading to the&#13;
burgeoning 'floating population'.&#13;
2.8    Recent labor and wage reforms are providing more incentives to improve&#13;
efficiency and increase labor mobility. These include the labor contract system, abolition&#13;
of job assignment by the state, and reforms in the wage system that strengthen the links&#13;
between performance and wage determination. It is expected that these reformns will&#13;
boost the demand for quality training programs, in contrast to the passive, supply-driven&#13;
programs of the past. Social security reform at present focuses on: (a) relieving the&#13;
individual enterprises of their social security responsibilities by making these services&#13;
available outside the enterprises; (b) enlarging the social security premium pool to&#13;
2  The labor requirements approach first sets a norm for agricultural labor productivity, and then calculates labor&#13;
requirements by applying the norm to actual output. Surplus labor is defined as the difference between actual&#13;
employment and estimated required employment.&#13;

district- and municipal-wide pooling, thereby reducing the risk to individual enterprises;&#13;
and (c) expanding coverage to all workers and all enterprises. By 1992, 80 percent of the&#13;
total social insurance expenditure in China is accounted for by SOEs. Pooling of social&#13;
insurance covering all workers would be a long term undertaking. Only 26 percent of&#13;
SOE workers are on contract. Labor turnover was still very low at I percent. China's&#13;
approach to economic and social reform is based on piloting new measures. The&#13;
proposed project is also designed to pilot the impact of providing employment and&#13;
training services supported by an enabling legal framework for labor market development&#13;
and mobility.&#13;
C. EMPLOYMENT SERVICES&#13;
2.9   Public Employment Services (ES) operate at all administrative levels although the&#13;
major responsibility for the Service is at the Province level, through Labor Service&#13;
Bureaus (LSBs). Lower level LSBs operate in Cities, Districts or Counties and limited&#13;
services are provided at the neighborhood, township and village level Employment&#13;
Stations. National policies for the ES are set by MOL. In total, there are about 4,000&#13;
LSBs throughout the country, targeting primarily the urban and, more particularly, City&#13;
areas. The Employment Service operates four types of outlets:&#13;
(a)   Employment Exchange Centers (EECs) responsible for job brokerage;&#13;
(b)   Unemployment Insurance (UI) to administer unemployment benefits;&#13;
(c)   Employment Training Centers responsible for retraining those registered as&#13;
unemployed; and&#13;
(d)   Labor Service Companies (LSCs) providing a mix of employment services&#13;
and creating employment.&#13;
Job Brokerage&#13;
2.10  There are an estimated 2,400 EECs. The Centers register unemployed people and&#13;
vacancies and provide limited labor market information at nominal charges. They&#13;
operate as "markets" where employers and job seekers come together to negotiate&#13;
directly. No screening of job applicants is undertaken and there is little counseling of&#13;
registrants. Negotiations between employers and job seekers usually take place on-site&#13;
and agreed contracts are then registered at the Center. Although the MOL has been&#13;
computerizing services in 14 cities and some sites have operating independent computer&#13;
systems, the majority of the services are provided manually. About 50 percent of all&#13;
vacancies are estimated to be handled by the ES. At present employers are required to&#13;
register their vacancies with the ES but as other private employment agencies develop&#13;
and as enterprises are released from government controls on employing people, the ES&#13;
will need to provide more market oriented services competitively and diversify its&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
Unemployment Insurance&#13;
2.11   UI is collected through a payroll-based levy which, until recently, was restricted&#13;
to SOEs. Coverage is now being extended to other forms of enterprise and to rural areas.&#13;
UI is payable only to unemployed people who have been displaced from enterprises&#13;
covered by the system and only in the area where they were employed. Entitlements are&#13;
not transferable between Cities nor from rural to urban areas. Progress is being made to&#13;
incorporate mobility provisions into the system especially since UI contributions are now&#13;
being pooled at municipal levels for later disbursement to Districts and Counties within&#13;
the Province. Ul contributions may be used to finance benefit payments, administration&#13;
of the Employment Service and training of unemployed workers. The MOL now requires&#13;
that 15 percent of the UI fund be used for retraining of surplus and unemployed workers.&#13;
Assistance may also be provided direct to SOEs with surplus workers and for small&#13;
business assistance.&#13;
Other Functions&#13;
2.12  Apart from its two core functions, the ES performs other limited functions. It&#13;
provides some labor market analysis and information but given the lack of any adequate&#13;
computerized data base, these are very limited. The MOL maintains national information&#13;
(published in the annual Year Book of Labor Statistics) and the information held at lower&#13;
levels of the Service is sparse and probably unreliable. The MOL has limited capacity to&#13;
analyze data and publish and disseminate findings on labor market activities and&#13;
employment trends. Few labor market studies such as forecasting or industry and&#13;
occupation studies are undertaken.  Little administrative information is available,&#13;
particularly financial data concerning the operations of the ES.&#13;
2.13  The ES offers some support to restructuring SOEs, although this support is&#13;
essentially passive-limited subsidies to wages to enable SOEs to retain surplus workers&#13;
or subsidies towards setting up surplus workers in enterprise subsidiaries known as Labor&#13;
Service Companies (LSC) which operate as collectives on the fringes of the SOEs. The&#13;
LSCs, though under state supervision, enjoy some autonomy as labor exchanges and as&#13;
centers for job training and creation by setting up their independent enterprises. They&#13;
perform distinct functions including: (a) the development and implementation of the labor&#13;
plan; (b) employment services which would otherwise not be available in their localities,&#13;
including registration of job vacancies, guidance, organization of training and periodic&#13;
labor markets, and promotion of labor mobility; and (c) operating enterprises designed to&#13;
create employment. There are no other forms of assistance (such as training packages or&#13;
financial support towards retraining within SOEs) nor are there any standard&#13;
methodologies (such as establishing local or SOE restructuring committees) for assisting&#13;
enterprises going through restructuring. No standard materials are available to support&#13;
these approaches.&#13;
2.14  In effect, the bulk of the responsibility for placing surplus workers falls on the&#13;
enterprises themselves. As a result, the scope of ES activities has been limited to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
small number of workers who are laid off. As open unemployment increases, the ESs&#13;
will be required to play a larger and more active role in job placement. At the same time,&#13;
the need for comprehensive income support and reemployment policies (on labor marke,&#13;
information, counseling, placement services and retraining programs) will also become&#13;
increasingly compelling. The proposed pilot project is designed to enhance the&#13;
Employment Service capacities to actively provide support to SOE reform.&#13;
D. SKILL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES&#13;
2.15  The demand for in-service training is met mainly from three sources. Most large&#13;
and some medium-sized state enterprises have a training institution for their own&#13;
employees designated as Enterprise Training Centers (ENTCs). Skilled workers schools&#13;
(SWSs) are under the general administration of the MOL and are managed by central&#13;
technical bureaus, local labor bureaus, and enterprises. The primary function of SWSs is&#13;
preservice training, but many also run in-service training programs for mid-level and&#13;
senior technicians. I,ocal labor bureaus also run Employment Training Centers (ETCs)&#13;
that deliver short-term training. In addition to these sources, the demand for in-service&#13;
training is attracting other suppliers to the market, including some in the private sector.&#13;
2.16  These training institutions are characterized by:&#13;
(a)   Low Internal Efficiency. Utilization of workshops and laboratories is&#13;
generally low, mostly because of the lack of appropriate equipment, a&#13;
shortage of consumable materials used  in practice training, and&#13;
shortcomings in curricula design and instructional management.&#13;
Instructional staff have very low teaching loads, both as stipulated by&#13;
regulation and in practice. Many of the institutions have significant excess&#13;
capacity.&#13;
(b)   Severe Resource Limitations. This is one of the most critical factors&#13;
contributing to low internal efficiency. The limitations are particularly&#13;
severe for the purchase of instructional materials, consumable materials for&#13;
practice training, tools and equipment. Vocational training is by nature&#13;
substantially more costly than general education. Given limited direct cost&#13;
recovery, the training institutions depend on their sponsoring government&#13;
bureaus or enterprises for resources.&#13;
(c)   Limited Industrial Experience of Teaching Staff. While the academic&#13;
training of teachers is in general satisfactory, many teachers lack adequate&#13;
industrial experience.  In addition, their teaching techniques consist&#13;
predominantly of lectures and some demonstration, and they are not familiar&#13;
with other pragmatic and effective techniques suitable for vocational&#13;
training, such as audiovisual and computer-based teaching techniques,&#13;
simulation technology, and use of performance-based objectives. As the&#13;
curricula and teaching materials are revised to make use of these techniques,&#13;
the teachers should also receive training in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
(d)   Inadequate  Instructional Material, Curriculum,  and  Teaching&#13;
Methods. The training curriculum and methods of instruction are not well-&#13;
suited to the needs of surplus workers and rural migrants who lack basic&#13;
education and skills needed to facilitate retraining. Adults demand training&#13;
that permits them to enter training on short notice and to return quickly to&#13;
employment when desired competencies have been achieved. Modular,&#13;
competency-based curricula and teaching methods that create this flexibility&#13;
are not available from current sources of training such as ETCs, which stress&#13;
short-term training. Teaching techniques in all sources of in-service training&#13;
consist predominantly of lectures and some demonstration.  Modern&#13;
techniques of instruction using audiovisual, computer-based teaching, and&#13;
simulation technology are not used. Outside ENTCs, instructors lack&#13;
industrial experience. While there are pockets of excellence with well-&#13;
organized and equipped schools and training centers, the overall picture is&#13;
one of out-dated facilities and equipment and poorly equipped laboratories&#13;
and practice facilities.&#13;
(e)   Uncertain External Efficiency.  External efficiency appears high, as&#13;
attested by the high percentage of graduates who are placed in jobs, and the&#13;
evidence of a continuing exchange of views among the training institutions,&#13;
employers, and government. However, this could simply be a reflection of&#13;
an absolute shortage of most types of skilled labor and of in-service training&#13;
slots, or the government's policy on full employment. When a more open&#13;
labor market develops, wages are decontrolled, and managers have a better&#13;
understanding of the operational costs and benefits of creating a skilled work&#13;
force, more conventional measures of external efficiency could be applied.&#13;
In the meantime, it is important to ensure that mechanisms to encourage and&#13;
demonstrate good training, and to engage local managers in determining and&#13;
applying training policy, are put in place.&#13;
(f)   Inadequate Management, Planning, and Coordination. Each type of&#13;
training institution has formal and informal links with the enterprise,&#13;
industry, or district it serves. These links facilitate communication between&#13;
individual institutions and employers or government regarding course&#13;
content, policy, labor market needs, etc. However, on a sector-wide basis,&#13;
there is greater scope for strengthening management, planning, and&#13;
coordination mechanisms.  Given the tendency of individual training&#13;
institutions to act as isolated entities serving only the sponsoring enterprise,&#13;
technical bureau, or district, there is a notable lack of sector-wide&#13;
coordination between employers and government and the three different&#13;
types of training institutions and thus there is no complete local database of&#13;
allocation of training places.&#13;
2.17  As a result of these weaknesses, the movement to a market economy will require&#13;
changes in the way skills training is organized, financed and delivered. The concept of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
life-time employment is disappearing and with it labor mobility will become more&#13;
important. This is already evident in the rising demand for in-service training. Opening&#13;
of the economy will bring more changes in technology and pressures for improving&#13;
productivity. These changes will require a more flexible training system, one that can&#13;
adapt quickly to new skill demands generated by changing markets and technologies and&#13;
that can deliver cost-effective training to workers as they enter their first jobs, but also on&#13;
a continuing basis throughout their careers. New policies defining the roles of the state&#13;
and nonstate sectors in providing skills training will be required and the present system&#13;
will need to be reformed.  To improve the utilization rates of training facilities,&#13;
complementary inputs (consumable materials, etc.) would have to be provided, by raising&#13;
cost recovery, leasing the facilities and equipment to other entities when they are not&#13;
being used, or shutting down training centers that prove too inefficient to maintain (i.e.&#13;
those for which there is insufficient demand). At the same time, access to external&#13;
training institutions by workers of small or loss-making enterprises which no longer find&#13;
it profitable to operate their own ENTCs should be ensured. The need to improve&#13;
instructional material, curriculum and teaching methods, and to train teaching staff in&#13;
their use, remains, regardless of the pace of enterprise reform. However, the case to&#13;
strengthen the planning and coordination mechanism would become stronger, since as&#13;
enterprises gain more autonomy over their activities, opportunities for contact between&#13;
government and industries become fewer, and without coordination there is a risk that&#13;
different entities could be duplicating efforts in the field of vocational training where&#13;
scale economies make such duplication inefficient. The proposed project would&#13;
enhance the efficiency of resource allocation to training providers by introducing a&#13;
transparent and market-driven funding mechanism and involving municipal&#13;
government departments, employers and trade associations in policy development&#13;
and governance of the training systems.&#13;

3. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND RECENT KEY&#13;
REFORMS&#13;
A. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
3.1   The Government's objective for the labor market reform program is to move away&#13;
from a state-administered system of labor allocation towards a market system while&#13;
minimizing the inevitable transition costs. Toward this end, the reform of social&#13;
insurance is a prerequisite. The Government's strategy is to concentrate on five main&#13;
policy directions. First, encouraging rural labor absorption through further development&#13;
of the TVEs.  Second, encouraging all forms of productive and service sector&#13;
employment growth in the towns. Third, expanding and improving urban labor market&#13;
services. Fourth, progressively allowing the market to determine wages and remove&#13;
barriers to labor mobility within the cities. Fifth, alleviating skill shortages. These policy&#13;
directions will be empowered through appropriate legislation. In addition, further&#13;
legislation is planned to meet the International Labor Office (ILO) standards regarding&#13;
free collective bargaining and working conditions. Since 1980, the Government has&#13;
initiated a series of reformns providing the basis for the development of the labor market.&#13;
Labor Contract System&#13;
3.2   Prior to the introduction of contracts governing the period and conditions of&#13;
service for new recruits, urban workers in wage employment were on a job-for-life basis.&#13;
Significant progress has since been made in moving workers to contract status, and in all&#13;
types of enterprises and in all the PMs most of the workers are now employed on this&#13;
basis. This represents an important potential improvement in labor mobility. The&#13;
maximum contract period is about five years. Temporary regulations have been issued by&#13;
the MOL regarding special categories such as temporary and seasonal workers.&#13;
3.3   While progress in this area is impressive it should be further accelerated. Under&#13;
the proposed project, PMs plan to transfer all workers to contract status by specified&#13;
dates-Deyang (end-1996), Guangzhou (end-1995), Shaoxing (already completed end-&#13;
1993), Weifang (end-1994), Wuhan (end-1995). Implementation in each PM is&#13;
coordinated by a committee headed by the mayor and including representatives of the&#13;
Labor Bureau, the Party, employers and trade unions.&#13;
Optimal Labor Reorganization&#13;
3.4   To combat the underemployment problem in state enterprises, the government&#13;
introduced the Optimal Labor Reorganization (OLR) program on a nationwide basis in&#13;
1989. OLR aims to eliminate surplus labor in enterprises through attrition and retraining,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and covered about 10.5 million workers by mid-1992. Under OLR, all remaining&#13;
workers would be encouraged to move on to a labor contract status.  In practice,&#13;
enterprises have tended to freeze recruitment of new workers and reduce overstaffing&#13;
through natural attrition, and, in more extreme cases, offer fully-paid retraining to some&#13;
surplus workers in the hope that they will move voluntarily to another job. So far the net&#13;
effects of these approaches has been to put first-time job seekers at a further disadvantage&#13;
as fewer vacancies are available without much reduction in the number of surplus&#13;
workers. Consequently, it is now common for affected state enterprises to establish labor&#13;
service companies with satellite enterprises as a means of redeploying surplus employees&#13;
and employing new labor market entrants. Although China enacted a bankruptcy law that&#13;
could be used in respect of insolvent state enterprises, it has not been applied widely.&#13;
Wage Reforms&#13;
3.5   Several key reforms in labor and wage policies in the 1980s have enabled&#13;
individual enterprises and the labor market to pursue some degree of efficiency and&#13;
flexibility, rather than security and rigidity. Wage reform linking remuneration to&#13;
productivity helps to increase workers' initiative in obtaining better skills, in contrast to&#13;
the supply-driven, passive attitude toward training in the past. Wage reform has taken&#13;
place in the form of reintroduction of piece rates and bonuses, thus linking remuneration&#13;
to productivity and allowing enterprises to distribute part of the after-tax profit as&#13;
bonuses. Following the adoption of the Labor Law in January 1995 (para. 3. 10) the MOL&#13;
and, in some cases, the cities, intend to issue regulations concerning: (a) the distribution&#13;
of different forms of remuneration to workers within enterprises; (b) minimum wages;&#13;
and (c) aggregate control of the wage bill. These reformns are intended to accelerate the&#13;
labor reform  process.  The force of these new  laws and regulations will be to:&#13;
(i) monetize in-kind benefits such as transport and housing; and (ii) protect the lowest&#13;
paid through minimum wages while ensuring that minimum rates do not significantly&#13;
reduce employment. For the time being, increases in the wage bill of SOEs will continue&#13;
to be tied to performance criteria while employers in non-SOE establishments will be&#13;
allowed to set wages freely at levels above minimum rates without state control. Wage&#13;
policy towards the SOEs will be reviewed as their financial position improves, and the&#13;
economy moves closer to a market system.&#13;
Social Insurance&#13;
3.6   Reforms in social insurance (pensions, unemployment and medical insurance) and&#13;
housing have gradually moved in the direction of making these services available outside&#13;
the enterprise sector. The guiding principles on which the individual reform steps in&#13;
social insurance are based are to: (a) relieve the individual enterprises of their heavy&#13;
social insurance responsibilities; (b) enlarge the social security premium pool, to reduce&#13;
the financial risk to individual enterprises; (c) expand the coverage of these measures to&#13;
all workers regardless of their status (permanent, contract, or temporary workers) or type&#13;
of enterprise they work for; (d) introduce policy changes to improve the management and&#13;
administration of the social security system to achieve economies of scale and better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
efficiency. The enlarged pool will allow risks to be distributed across enterprises&#13;
employing workers with different age and illness/injury profiles. Approaches taken or&#13;
actively being considered for selected social insurance areas in several municipalities&#13;
which are advanced in their reform of the social insurance delivery and housing system&#13;
are summarized below.&#13;
3.7   To provide a social safety net for workers displaced by the application of budget&#13;
constraints to enterprises, the government set up an unemployment insurance scheme in&#13;
1986.  Eligibility requires that retrenchment arose from  one of the following:&#13;
(a) bankruptcy; (b) enterprise restructuring; (c) termination of labor contract; or&#13;
(d) dismissal following a breach of the internal SOE rules. In addition to cash benefits,&#13;
the scheme also provides training to the unemployed. At end-1993, the scheme covered&#13;
about 90 percent of workers in state enterprises.&#13;
3.8   For health insurance, a system which would pool comprehensive health care&#13;
benefits across all the enterprises in the municipality, and all types of workers will be&#13;
developed. All industries would be covered in order to pool the risks associated with&#13;
differences across industries both in proportion of retirees and of occurrences of certain&#13;
medical conditions.&#13;
3.9   For housing reform, the overall objective is to expand the availability of&#13;
commercialized housing and the establishment of a financially viable institutional&#13;
framework to operate such a housing sector. A pilot project is being supported by the&#13;
Bank to help four municipalities implement a strategy to develop a market-based housing&#13;
system with a view to empowering the workers to rent or buy housing commercially.&#13;
Basic Labor Law&#13;
3.10  A Labor Law has been passed and made effective as of January 1, 1995. Since&#13;
the enactment of the Law, which defines the basic rights of workers and employers, 17&#13;
implementing regulations have been issued and 20 more are under preparation. In total,&#13;
over 51 laws and regulations would be required to cover the various aspects of the Labor&#13;
Law. Under the proposed project, assistance would be provided to the MOL in the&#13;
formulation of selected laws and implementing regulations which would cover three out&#13;
of 13 chapters of the Labor Law.&#13;
B. LESSONS FROM BANK GROUP EXPERIENCE IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES&#13;
3.11  The proposed pilot project incorporates lessons of experience from  similar&#13;
projects elsewhere and the limited experience in China. Lessons from similar projects in&#13;
the transition economies in Europe and the former Soviet Union emphasize the&#13;
importance of ensuring government ownership of the project in its design, the setting of&#13;
realistic project goals, and careful monitoring and evaluation to guide mid-course&#13;
adjustments. In China, the Vocational Technical Education (VTE) Project (Cr. 2114-&#13;
CHA) illustrates the need for strong Government commitment to, and ownership of,&#13;
policy reforms. The Government was reluctant to utilize the resources allocated for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
technical assistance and training available in the VTE project. Under the proposed pilot&#13;
project, the joint proposals from the MOL and PMs for policy and legal reform reflect&#13;
their priorities and the Bank facilitated in reaching consensus.  The importance of&#13;
developing clear protocols to guide project implementation and management where inter-&#13;
agency cooperation is needed is also noted. During project preparation, the Bank was&#13;
actively involved in providing selected technical assistance and bringing international&#13;
experience to the preparation workshops where central, provincial and municipal&#13;
government officials participated.&#13;
3.12  The 1995 World Development Report reviewed lessons drawn from three types of&#13;
policy responses by governments intended to speed the transition and ease the plight of&#13;
displaced workers, as shown in Table 3.1: (a) reducing labor market rigidities; (b)&#13;
assisting workers by equipping them to adapt to change; and (c) providing transfers to&#13;
reduce income losses. Although lessons have been noted from the Bank's experience&#13;
with policies to improve labor mobility in the transitional economies of Eastern Europe&#13;
and the former Soviet Union, these lessons are not totally relevant since China is different&#13;
in one key aspect. Its GDP growth has averaged 9.6 percent annually from 1980 to 1993,&#13;
compared with 2.9 percent for other low, middle and high income countries. It has the&#13;
fastest growing economy in the world. Although much of the growth is concentrated in&#13;
the coastal region, new investment is beginning to move inward. By contrast, experience&#13;
with labor market policies to promote labor mobility in transition economies elsewhere&#13;
has been in a climate of economic retrenchment. In other transition economies, as well as&#13;
in Latin American and Middle Eastern Countries under adjustment, formal employment&#13;
has fallen by/5 to 15 percent during the transition and real wages have decreased by more&#13;
than 40 percent in extreme cases.&#13;
3.13  The Bank's experience with policies to ease employment restructuring should be&#13;
interpreted against this background. The key difference is that unlike the transition&#13;
economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, there are jobs in&#13;
China for workers to move to. Fifteen years of gradualist reforms have produced this&#13;
growth. Not all provinces and cities, however, share equally in this growth, and thus,&#13;
some areas face labor surplus problems similar to those of other transition economies.&#13;

Legislation impeding mobility  Residence permits and restrictive job security regulations should be lifted.&#13;
Wage flexibility              Increased relative wage flexibility key to sectoral employment adjustment;&#13;
can reduce aggregate employment decline.&#13;
Reducing disincentives to move    Delinking social services from labor contracts important in former centrally&#13;
across jobs                    planned economies. Reforming other markets, especially housing, essential.&#13;
Equipping Workers for Change&#13;
Retraining                     Expensive. Limited number of robust evaluations, even in industrial&#13;
countries. State financing (but rarely provision) desirable in some cases, for&#13;
those hurt by changes, at least on welfare and political ground.&#13;
Job search assistance          Inexpensive and often effective in industrial countries in increasing job&#13;
placement, although relevant only for a fraction ofjob seekers. May help in&#13;
former centrally-planned economies.&#13;
Employment subsidies           Expensive, often risky, with only minor net effects in industrial countries.&#13;
Can risk undermining reforms. May make sense if tightly targeted, in one-&#13;
company towns.&#13;
Allowances (grants, loans, or  Expensive. Net employment effects rarely properly evaluated. Only apply to&#13;
prepayment of benefits) to     a small minority of workers even in industrial countries.&#13;
support business start-ups&#13;
Public employment for          Mixed results. Rarely properly evaluated. Some positive effects of programs&#13;
disadvantaged youth and public   carefully target on dropout minorities when mixed with on-the-job training.&#13;
support of apprenticeship      Administratively intensive and difficult to implement outside industrial&#13;
countries.&#13;
Providing Transfers&#13;
Unemployment benefits          Useful in first stages of transition from central planning. Disincentive effects&#13;
of long-duration benefits found in industrial countries. Benefits should be&#13;
simple.&#13;
Severance pay                  Often part of formal sector contract; can be key to downsizing public sector.&#13;
Old-age and disability pension  Major cash benefit scheme in former centrally-planned economies. Often&#13;
used in lieu of unemployment benefits. Often require immediate cost-&#13;
containment on fiscal grounds. Long-term reform toward funded&#13;
arrangement desirable.&#13;
Social assistance and          Can reduce poverty of those hurt in transition. Means-testing can be difficult.&#13;
family benefits                Family benefits generous in former centrally-planned economies and may&#13;
need to be cut back on fiscal grounds.&#13;

3.14  While efforts have been made to make labor markets more adaptable by reforms&#13;
reducing labor market rigidities and to provide transfers that reduce income losses,&#13;
interest has centered on ways governments can equip workers to adapt to change.&#13;
Making labor markets efficient and adaptable means more than simply removing&#13;
systemic barriers to mobility, and ensuring wages adjust quickly. Workers must also&#13;
have the resources to take advantage of new opportunities, which means ensuring they&#13;
have the appropriate skills and job search habits to be truly flexible and adaptable in fast-&#13;
changing labor markets. Measures to achieve these goals are described as active labor&#13;
market policies. Experience with these policies in industrial and transition economies&#13;
suggests that they be introduced with attention to their economic benefits and costs. Pilot&#13;
testing of programs is important along with monitoring and evaluation of results.&#13;
C. BANK GROUP COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
3.15  The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) supports China's medium-&#13;
term  development challenges to promote:  (a) sustainable growth within a stable&#13;
macroeconomic environment; and (b) poverty reduction, human resource development,&#13;
improving the distribution of income, alleviate infrastructure constraints and&#13;
environmental protection. The Bank CAS is described in detail in the Memorandum Of&#13;
the President dated May 4, 1995 and presented to the Board on June 1, 1995.&#13;
3.16  Reform of SOEs, by commercializing their operations, ending their dependence&#13;
on subsidized credit from the banking system, and transferring their social service&#13;
functions to more appropriate agencies, will receive special emphasis. The Bank would&#13;
utilize a mix of targeted economic and sector work, and investment and technical&#13;
assistance operations to assist China in achieving its dual objectives. In economic and&#13;
sector work, the Bank will continue to provide the Government with advice on all aspects&#13;
of macroeconomic policy. Moreover the Bank has been increasingly providing the&#13;
Government with short, focused policy notes that examine key issues of current&#13;
importance. Since nearly all Bank assisted operations touch upon issues of enterprise&#13;
efficiency, the Bank Group's assistance is addressing the various dimensions of SOE&#13;
reforms. First, through ESW and TA, the Bank, in collaboration with Government&#13;
agencies, is undertaking an extensive study of the SOE sector related to inter alia&#13;
corporate governance, separation of social services and labor mobility. To complement&#13;
this effort, the Government and the Bank held a major international conference on options&#13;
for SOE reforms presented by Chinese policy makers. A parallel study on social security&#13;
reform will examine alternative institutional and financial options for introducing&#13;
unemployment insurance and providing retirees with pensions.&#13;
3.17  A series of pilot projects are included in the lending program to demonstrate key&#13;
principles of SOE reform in various provinces. The Enterprise Housing and Social&#13;
Security Reform Project (FY95) is testing innovative approaches to social service&#13;
provision in four municipalities and assisting in social security reform. Two industrial&#13;
assisting reform projects will work with two municipalities to inter alia change&#13;
institutional framework and principles for enterprise governance. In agriculture, Bank&#13;
assistance will also promote enterprise restructuring by transferring technical and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
managerial know-how to enterprises under the proposed State Farms Commercialization,&#13;
the Animal Feed and the Seed Sector Commercialization projects. The IFC, through joint&#13;
ventures with SOEs will facilitate the entrance of major world-class industrial partners&#13;
into China to achieve greater economies of scale, and introduce new technologies and&#13;
approaches to enterprise management. The Economic Law Reform Project (FY95) also&#13;
supports SOE reform through TA for the preparation/revisions of such laws as&#13;
bankruptcy, partnership, enterprise law, etc. A Vocational Education Reform Project is&#13;
also planned focusing on the delivery of preservice training. The proposed pilot project is&#13;
another component in the Bank's strategy towards SOE reform. It is aimed at developing&#13;
policy and legal reforms to facilitate labor market development and labor mobility,&#13;
strengthening labor market services, and providing targeted in-service training to meet the&#13;
growing demand for skilled labor. By design, the project is small and a pilot. It focuses&#13;
on selected components where the participating agencies' commitment to the reform is&#13;
strong.&#13;
D. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE&#13;
3.18  Rationale for Bank Group Assistance. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
that was presented to the Board on June 1, 1995 highlighted the reform of SOEs as&#13;
crucial for improving efficiency in the real sectors, facilitating reforms in the financial&#13;
sector, and reducing the consolidated public sector deficit. The proposed pilot project is a&#13;
key element in this priority area, as follows. First, it would support employment&#13;
assistance strategies that facilitate the transfer of surplus labor in SOEs to more&#13;
productive employment in other parts of the economy. Second it would contribute to&#13;
labor market development in the state and non-state sectors by building capacity for&#13;
policy development and the management of employment assistance programs. Third, it&#13;
would help restructure key parts of the jobs training infrastructure and place it on a more&#13;
market-oriented basis. This project -- in conjunction with several other investment and&#13;
technical assistance operations outlined in the CAS that cover industrial restructuring,&#13;
vocational training, and economic law reform -- will help establish a comprehensive&#13;
framework of basic policy and investment measures required to promote enterprise&#13;
reform throughout China. The project also fits with the ongoing policy dialogue with&#13;
Government on labor market reform. In particular, the project draws on three important&#13;
sector studies: the 1992 study on urban employment and wage systems in China, which&#13;
produced an action plan for employment and wage reforns (Report No. 10266-CHA); the&#13;
1993 study on employment and training implications of enterprise reform (Report No.&#13;
11785-CHA); and the background papers for the recent policy conference in Beijing on&#13;
SOE reform, which addressed corporate governance, separation of social services, and&#13;
labor mobility.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1   The proposed pilot project would contribute to an enabling environment for SOE&#13;
reforms and promote China's transition to a market economy. The transfer of surplus&#13;
labor from enterprises, where it is no longer demanded, to those where it can be used&#13;
more productively while minimizing the potential for social instability is one of the&#13;
ultimate objectives of SOE reforms. The objectives of the proposed four-year pilot&#13;
project are to:&#13;
(a)   support policy and legal reforms to facilitate the development of functioning&#13;
labor markets and promote urban labor mobility;&#13;
(b)   improve the delivery of labor market services, and training to facilitate the&#13;
redeployment of, surplus workers in SOEs, the unemployed, and rural-to-&#13;
urban migrant labor and thus increase labor productivity and mobility; and&#13;
(c)   enhance the institutional capacity of project implementing agencies with a&#13;
view to promoting market-based services.&#13;
B. PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
4.2   Project preparation was launched in February 1994 by the MOL. Earlier in a&#13;
November 1993 identification mission, the MOL and the Bank decided upon six criteria&#13;
for selection of PMs: (a) a strong commitment to market-oriented reforms; (b) a record&#13;
of active pursuit of the March 1993 Employment and Wage Reform Action Plan prepared&#13;
jointly by the Bank and the Government; (c) evidence of employment problems&#13;
represented by surplus labor in state-owned enterprises, rural to urban migrants, or&#13;
numbers of hard-to-place job seekers; (d) institutional capacity to deliver middle and&#13;
high-level skills training; (e) a willingness to test innovative solutions to training and&#13;
labor market problems; and (f) adequate growth for absorbing surplus labor. Regional&#13;
balance was later added to the list of selection criteria.&#13;
4.3   A competitive selection process was used to choose the PMs. The MOL and the&#13;
Bank invited 12 municipalities, representing 11 provinces, to submit proposals for&#13;
participation in the project. A seminar attended by all the cities was held during the&#13;
November 1993 identification mission to explain the project and competitive process.&#13;
The cities were asked to include information in their proposal on the following: (a) an&#13;
economic and demographic description of the city; (b) a profile of the community's&#13;
employment problems; (c) the city's record of economic and labor reforms with reference&#13;
to the March 1993 Action Plan; (d) the condition and performance of employment service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
and vocational training institutions; (e) an analysis of the factors constraining the&#13;
effective performance of employment and training institutions; and (f) a description of the&#13;
proposed pilot project to improve these institutions.&#13;
4.4   Eleven municipalities subsequently submitted proposals. The Bank and the MOL&#13;
jointly evaluated the submissions in February 1994. Three municipalities were dropped&#13;
and one city was selected based on the written proposals. Interviews were conducted&#13;
with the remaining cities to select four additional PMs. One of the five selected PMs,&#13;
Shaoxing, submitted a joint proposal with its provincial government, Zhejiang Province&#13;
(ZP). Each PM was asked to explain how it would consult stakeholders and develop&#13;
political commitment to policy reforms. A commitment was requested in this case from&#13;
the mayor's office of each city to ensure support for proposed labor and training reforms&#13;
and a willingness to accept the on-lending arrangements for repaying the loan.&#13;
4.5  In each PM chosen, a Leading Project Group (LPG) was created to oversee&#13;
project preparation. The membership of LPGs included senior officials from municipal&#13;
bureaus for finance, planning, reform, industry, labor, and education. This provided a&#13;
broad political base for planning reforms. Working groups led by the labor bureau in&#13;
each city carried out the technical task of studies and project preparation. The MOL&#13;
coordinated preparation. Throughout, a consultative process was used by the MOL, PMs,&#13;
and the Bank to exchange experience and information. LPGs met in Guangzhou in July&#13;
1994 to review preparation documents in a workshop. The workshop included the&#13;
sharing of international experience by the Bank and opportunities for the MOL and cities&#13;
to exchange project ideas and learn from each other.&#13;
4.6   A follow-up workshop for the five PMs and ZP was held November 1994 in&#13;
Beijing to refine the project documents. During the three-day workshop, chaired by the&#13;
MOL, the revised project documents were discussed in three groups: policy and legal,&#13;
labor market information and services, and vocational training. These workshops helped&#13;
cities exchange ideas and coordinate components such as that for labor market&#13;
information which requires uniform standards for computerization and data collection.&#13;
The consultative process has established a firm commitment to, and ownership of, the&#13;
proposed project by the MOL, PMs and ZP.&#13;
4.7   An action plan was prepared following the November 1994 workshop. The action&#13;
plan led to the preparation of a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) consolidating the&#13;
MOL's national component with the five PMs' proposals. A PHRD (Policy and Human&#13;
Resource Development Fund) grant, under split execution by the MOL and the Bank, was&#13;
used to help prepare the PIP. The PHRD fund provided technical assistance to support&#13;
preparation efforts and familiarize policy makers and senior technical staff to the&#13;
experiences of other countries through study tours.&#13;
4.8   The current status of project preparation will permit timely project start-up,&#13;
following credit/loan effectiveness. The policy and legal reform agenda has been&#13;
identified. A needs assessment for computerization has been completed and hardware&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
and software requirements have been reviewed. Proposals for expanding in-service&#13;
training facilities, including preliminary specifications for civil works and equipment&#13;
have been prepared for submission to the new Vocational Training Coordination&#13;
Committee (VTCC) established in each PM. A framework for staff development needs&#13;
has been identified and a training plan strategy agreed.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.9   The pilot project would support labor market policy and legal reforms at the&#13;
national level and introduce and test employment services including in-service training in&#13;
the PMs. Staff training, as part of institutional development, would also be organized for&#13;
the MOL and PM staff.&#13;
Policy and Legal Reform ($0.2 million)&#13;
4.10  The proposed pilot project would finance technical assistance to help the MOL&#13;
prepare vital labor legislation and regulations in a number of areas key to the reform&#13;
process. These are laws on employment promotion and vocational skill development,&#13;
and regulations on unemployment insurance, vocational skill testing and certification,&#13;
employment exchange, employment training and retraining, and rural migration. The&#13;
adoption of such laws and regulations would complement the existing legal framework to&#13;
promote the development of the labor market. The laws and regulations to be enacted&#13;
and issued would inter alia promote rights of workers and employers; define the&#13;
financing, and coverage of unemployment insurance; promote private sector employment&#13;
services; establish policy instruments to improve quality of and access to training; set&#13;
national standards for skill testing and certification. Out of 51 laws and regulations&#13;
required for the implementation of the Labor Law, 17 have already been enacted or&#13;
issued, another 17 are under preparation, and the remaining will be drafted during the&#13;
next two years. The MOL has identified seven out of the remaining 17 laws and&#13;
regulations for assistance under the proposed project. These selected areas of reform are&#13;
particularly relevant to the project. The PMs would also adopt implementing regulations&#13;
based on the national laws and regulations. Annex 2 presents the outlines for the legal&#13;
reform agenda. The government seeks assistance to learn from the experience of other&#13;
countries for adaptation to China's conditions. A panel of foreign and national experts&#13;
will be constituted to advise on the policy and legal reform. International and national&#13;
seminars to develop regulations would be held with related social sectors in order to&#13;
gather views from national legislation bodies, other relevant departments, enterprises,&#13;
academics and workers. The panel would assist in research and review of the proposed&#13;
legislation and also in dissemination and training. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained from the Borrower to prepare the identified legislation in accordance with a&#13;
time-bound action plan acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.11  To complement the policy and legal framework, pooling the delivery of social&#13;
services at murnicipal, provincial, and ultimately national level is critical to labor&#13;
mobility. Toward meeting this objective, the PMs have set specific targets dates, shown&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
in Table 4.1 to progressively cover all SOE and self-employed workers by pension, UI&#13;
and medical benefits. The transfer of these services from the SOEs to the Municipal&#13;
administrations, which is a first step in overall social insurance reform, is intended to&#13;
accelerate the redeployment of surplus labor to other productive activities. For pensions,&#13;
the selected cities plan to move toward comprehensive pooling which would allow&#13;
enterprises (i.e. not only SOEs but to include COEs, joint ventures and private&#13;
enterprises) and workers (permanent, contract and temporary) to adopt unifonn&#13;
contribution rates across all workers and enterprises. An assurance was also obtained&#13;
from the PMs to implement the social insurance reforms in accordance with a time-bound&#13;
action plan acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

Labor Market Services ($11.9 million)&#13;
4.12  The project would finance the establishment of a labor market information system&#13;
(LMIS) network in the MOL, the PMs and ZP. Based on the network, the employment&#13;
service system would cater for labor exchanges, UI and data analysis. Each PM and ZP&#13;
would establish a citywide labor information computer management network, taking both&#13;
urban and rural-to-urban labor and employers under its jurisdiction as its customers. The&#13;
PMs and ZP would establish a local area network connected with the neighborhood and&#13;
county EECs. At the national level, the MOL would set up an LMIS to collect and&#13;
exchange regional employment data including with the PMs. Throughthis system, the&#13;
three primary functions of the ESs would be integrated.&#13;
4.13  The LMIS will record data on job seekers, job vacancies and basic information on&#13;
employers. The operating staff responsible for the employment services would be able to&#13;
match the qualifications of the job seeker with suitable job openings and provide limited&#13;
job counseling on training needs. Collection of Ul contributions, the payment of benefits&#13;
and the financial management would also be integrated in the LMIS. This integration&#13;
would allow the UI system to exchange relevant information with the job brokerage&#13;
system. Finally the LMIS would have the capacity for compilation and use in the&#13;
analysis of municipal labor market for policy analysis. This function would support the&#13;
internal and external employment service organizations and the administrative&#13;
departments of the MOL and Labor Bureaus to monitor the status of the labor market,&#13;
employment trends, and conduct statistical analysis and forecasting. Researchers and&#13;
academics would have access to the LMIS data for further analysis and dissemination.&#13;
In-Service Vocational Training ($26.1 million)&#13;
4.14  The proposed project would support the establishment of an institutional capacity&#13;
to plan effectively and manage efficiently a complete system of in-service vocational&#13;
training. To attain this goal, Deyang, Wuhan and Weifang have created VTCCs to plan&#13;
and coordinate all in-service training programs in their respective jurisdictions.&#13;
Membership of the VTCC includes employers, workers, and municipal finance, education&#13;
and labor bureaus. Sources of funds for the Vocational Training Funds (VTF), to be&#13;
managed by the VTCC have been identified to finance all municipal in-service training.&#13;
Shaoxing has established the Shaoxing Municipal Vocational Skills Leading Group in&#13;
1994, with a mandate similar to that of the VTCCs, and will activate a VTF under the&#13;
project. Guangzhou already has an effective coordinating structure and will adopt criteria&#13;
for allocating resources for training. In Guangzhou, enterprises and training providers are&#13;
closely cooperating in designing training programs, financing and placement of trained&#13;
workers. The PMs would channel all municipal resources for training (including Bank-&#13;
financed Grants) through the VTFs. Under the proposed project, each PM will, through&#13;
its VTCC, make grants out of the loan/credit proceeds to public and private training&#13;
providers for vocational training sub-projects on conditions satisfactory to the Bank. To&#13;
be eligible for Grants, training providers would have to demonstrate a capacity to deliver&#13;
effective training by having professional, full-time management, appropriate facilities for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
training and practice, a modular, competency-based curriculum, qualified instructors and&#13;
a standard financial accounting system. Training proposals should also be justified by&#13;
market demand demonstrated by the availability of contracts with employers, job&#13;
vacancies advertised, and rising employment and wages for workers with the particular&#13;
skills offered by the training provider. The unit cost of training by skill would be&#13;
measured against the benefit to be derived from higher productivity, earnings and profits.&#13;
A draft operational manual for establishing the funding criteria is presented in Annex 3.&#13;
The operating procedures for the VTF including the criteria for allocating training funds&#13;
was confirmed during negotiations. Assurances were obtained that by April 30, 1996, the&#13;
PMs would establish VTFs and adopt operational manuals under arrangements&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.15   Survey results conducted  in each PM  during project preparation have&#13;
demonstrated the need for expanding advanced vocational and technical training&#13;
capacities, updating bases for skill practice for self-employment, improving facilities and&#13;
quality of employment training. Targeted expansion of selected training capacities would&#13;
relieve the skill shortages which are in demand. In the PMs, bases for skill practice in&#13;
vocational training entities would be established by improving the training equipment and&#13;
teaching quality. The training institutions will become the model training entities in these&#13;
cities mainly for training low and medium skilled workers, so as to solve the problems of&#13;
the training and reemployment of unemployed, surplus labor in SOEs. Financing of&#13;
specific training facilities would be subject to criteria established by the VTCC.&#13;
4.16  At the national level, the project would strengthen the National Vocational Skill&#13;
Testing and Guidance Center (VSTGC). The Center was established in 1994 within&#13;
MOL, in anticipation of the project, and is intended to provide the means to set standards&#13;
for occupational skills and assess the skills of workers against those standards. Technical&#13;
assistance and staff development are needed to operationalize the VSTGC which will&#13;
provide coordination and guidance to the pilot cities in setting up and strengthening&#13;
Vocational Skill Testing Stations (VSTS) to evaluate the quality of skills training which&#13;
is independent from the providers of such training and focusing on competency in the&#13;
occupational skills identified by employers.  The Center is mandated to provide&#13;
professional and technical guidance in establishing testing criteria and occupational&#13;
standards to improve labor market information and training quality. Under the project,&#13;
the VSTGC would pilot the establishment of occupational standards for 20 skills. Each&#13;
PM would also establish VSTS to provide services in skill level testing and certification&#13;
for major skill areas in their respective cities, unifying testing criteria and issuing skill&#13;
certificates.&#13;
Institutional Development ($3.0 million)&#13;
4.17  The computerization of the labor market services and the introduction of new&#13;
training financing mechanisms would require considerable staff training and institutional&#13;
capacity building. Selected staff from MOL and PMs would also undergo local and&#13;
overseas training and participate in study tours. This program is intended to provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
training opportunities for senior policy and technical staff to learn from the experience of&#13;
other countries. During project implementation overseas study tours and group training&#13;
programs would be conducted. In addition local training sessions will be organized by&#13;
specialists from overseas. A training program strategy, presented in Annex 4 has been&#13;
finalized during negotiations. Local and foreign training institutions would be recruited&#13;
to assist MOL, the PMs and ZP in identifying suitable training programs. Consultants for&#13;
these services would be recruited by April 30, 1996. The computerization of job&#13;
brokerage, unemployment insurance, and labor market information would require&#13;
restructuring of employment services in the Labor Bureaus. Consultants would assist the&#13;
PMs in reviewing the existing organizational structures and recommending appropriate&#13;
changes, inter alia, by developing operating procedures. The institutional development&#13;
support would also build capacities in the MOL and PMs for monitoring, evaluation and&#13;
dissemination (MED), to ensure that the lessons from the pilot project are properly&#13;
recorded, evaluated and disseminated. During negotiations assurances were obtained&#13;
that the Borrower, the PMs and ZP would undertake the staff training in accordance with&#13;
a plan acceptable to the Bank. Assurances were also obtainedfor the Borrower to carry&#13;
out the review to develop suitable organizational structures for the Labor Bureaus&#13;
providing employment services, in accordance with an action plan acceptable to the&#13;
Bank&#13;
D. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
4.18  The total project cost, including taxes and duties is estimated at $51.8 million,&#13;
with a foreign exchange component of $23.4 million. The taxes and duties are to be&#13;
financed by the government. The cost estimates were assessed based on prevailing prices&#13;
in July 1995. For contingency allowances, physical contingencies of 10 percent were&#13;
applied to the base cost of goods and works. The following price contingency rates were&#13;
applied to all components: for local expenditures: 10 percent for 1996, 8.5 percent for&#13;
1997, 7.0 percent for 1998 and 6.5 percent for 1999; for foreign expenditures, 2.5 percent&#13;
for 1996 through 1999. The project cost summary is shown in Table 4.2 and detailed&#13;
project costs are presented in Annex 5.&#13;
4.19  The proposed credit and loan of $30 million would finance 58 percent of the total&#13;
project cost-100 percent of the total foreign exchange cost and 28 percent of local&#13;
costs-net of taxes. The PMs, ZP and MOL would contribute the balance and annually&#13;
make budgetary allocations for the recurrent expenditures required during and after&#13;
project implementation. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower&#13;
would allocate a portion of the credit/loan proceeds to the PMs through their Provincial&#13;
Governments and to ZP, at not more than 4.0 percent annual interest, for 20 years,&#13;
including a grace period offive years. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the&#13;
PMs and ZP. The distribution of the loan/credit amount among the MOL, the PMs and&#13;
ZP is based on the individual proposals and the justifications for the investments. Table&#13;
4.3 presents the financing plan for GOC and the Bank.&#13;

E. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.20 The MOL, the PMs and ZP would be responsible for the overall implementation&#13;
of the project.   To  provide unified  coordination  and  management during  project&#13;
implementation, MOL has established a Project Coordination Group (PCG) comprising&#13;
the heads of the Employment Department, the Vocational Skill Development&#13;
Department, Laws and Regulations Department, Information Center and the World Bank&#13;
Operations Office (WBOO). The primary functions of this group are to provide policy&#13;
guidance, coordinate project implementation and settle emerging issues. A parallel unit&#13;
in each PM is the LPG, established during project preparation and composed of the senior&#13;
officials of the municipal government and the representatives of the municipal Labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Bureau, Finance Bureau, Planning Committee, Education Committee and the Structural&#13;
Reform Committee. The LPGs will liaise with the PCG; provide overall guidance and&#13;
coordination for implementation; and approve policies initiated by municipal&#13;
organizations.&#13;
4.21  The WBOO is responsible for leading and coordinating the implementation of the&#13;
proposed project. WBOO was established in November 1993 as an administrative&#13;
department of MOL to mobilize foreign capital. The WBOO has External Relations,&#13;
Procurement and Accounting Sections. Its current staff consists of the Chief and Deputy-&#13;
Chief and seven specialists and project officers. WBOO's mandate includes coordination&#13;
with the relevant departments of the State Council and the other departments of MOL on&#13;
the development and management of the project; coordinating and managing the&#13;
preparation and implementation of the project, supervising and evaluating the project;&#13;
coordinating training and study tours; consultant recruitment and equipment procurement;&#13;
liaising with the Bank; preparation and submission of progress reports and maintaining&#13;
project accounts. The WBOO would also liaise closely with the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MOF), the State Planning Committee (SPC) and the State Audit Administration (SAA).&#13;
Assurances were obtained from the Borrower that MOL would maintain WBOO with a&#13;
TOR, staffing and other resources acceptable to the Bank to be responsible for the&#13;
coordination of the project.&#13;
4.22  Each PM and ZP has also set up a Project Implementation Office (PIO) for day to&#13;
day management of the project. In addition to a core staff of the PIOs, the Labor Bureau,&#13;
Finance Bureau, Planning Committee, Auditing Bureau, the Structural Reform&#13;
Committee and the Education Committee staff of each PM would assist the PIOs. PIOs&#13;
will be responsible for the design, justification and implementation of the project. They&#13;
would: (a) review suitable mechanisms to implement the national laws and regulations to&#13;
be prepared under the project; (b) prepare annual implementation plans including the&#13;
financial requirements for the project; (c) supervise the project components and prepare&#13;
quarterly progress reports to be submitted to WBOO; (d) prepare procurement plans and&#13;
consultancy requirements; (e) maintain separate financial statements for the project; (f)&#13;
organize and conduct the detailed municipal staff development and the overseas study&#13;
tour plan to be coordinated by MOL; (g) conduct analysis and evaluation of the project&#13;
periodically; (h) prepare the project final implementation report and organize an&#13;
evaluation; and (i) liaise closely with the WBOO. Assurances were obtained from the&#13;
PMs and ZP that they would maintain the PIOs with TORs, staffing and other resources&#13;
acceptable to the Bank to be responsible for the coordination and supervision of the&#13;
project at their level. Organization Charts for the proposed project are presented in&#13;
Annex 6.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.23  The WBOO and PIOs, assisted by a local procurement agency, to be retained by&#13;
the WBOO, would be responsible for all project related procurement. Based on the&#13;
specific requirements of the PMs and ZP for purchase of computers, in-service training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
equipment, and recruitment of expatriate consultants, the WBOO will package the items&#13;
suitable for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB). Other specialized items required by the PMs and ZP will be procured under&#13;
national shopping by the PIOs, and individual local consultants will be hired directly.&#13;
For all ICB and major NCB contracts, the WBOO would designate a local procurement&#13;
agency to invite bids, prepare evaluation reports for transmittal to the Bank. The standard&#13;
bidding document prepared by the MOF and approved by the Bank will be used for ICB.&#13;
4.24  Goods including specialized equipment and other training materials costing less&#13;
than $50,000 equivalent, per contract and with a total value not exceeding $1.2 million&#13;
would be procured under national shopping. Goods including computers, training and&#13;
practice equipment costing $50,000 equivalent or more and less than $200,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract, and not exceeding an aggregate amount of $3.3 million would be procured&#13;
under NCB. All other contracts for goods worth $200,000 equivalent or more each,&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank, would be procured under ICB in accordance with the&#13;
Bank Procurement Guidelines of January 1995. A domestic preference would be allowed&#13;
for procurement under ICB procedures. Civil works contracts, financed by the PMs,&#13;
would be arranged under the Government's local procurement procedure. Consulting&#13;
firms and institutions would be recruited to organize training and study tours. All&#13;
consultants contracts of $50,000 equivalent or more for individuals and $100,000&#13;
equivalent or more for firms would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Employment&#13;
of local and foreign consultants would be in accordance with the guidelines on the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers published in August 1981.&#13;
4.25  The basic specifications of most of the computers, and the training equipment&#13;
required by each PM are standardized and would be suitable for consolidating the&#13;
requirements of the PMs and ZP in a few packages. The procurement arrangements are&#13;
shown in Table 4.4 and a detailed procurement plan is presented in the PIP and&#13;
summarized in Annex 1.&#13;

G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.26  Based on project proposals prepared by the MOL, the PMs and ZP, the&#13;
distribution of the credit/loan would be: MOL-$1.5 million; Deyang-$4.0 million;&#13;
Guangzhou-$5.0 million; Shaoxing-$4.9 million; Weifang-$4.5 million; and Wuhan-$8.0&#13;
million, and ZP $2.1 million. The proposed disbursement arrangements are shown in&#13;
Table 4.5.&#13;
4.27  Annual disbursement targets for credit/loan proceeds are shown in Table 4.6&#13;
Although the average disbursement profile for China extends over six years, there is no&#13;
specific profile to be used for the proposed pilot project. However, similar operations in&#13;
Europe and Central Asia Region (Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia) have a four-year disbursement period. For the proposed project, a four-year&#13;
disbursement schedule is adopted with a completion date of June 30, 1999 and a closing&#13;
date of December 31, 1999. The bulk of the equipment procurement is expected to be&#13;
initiated during the first year. Detailed procurement packaging of the labor market&#13;
information system and the advanced preparation of the in-service training components&#13;
which account for 84 percent of the loan/credit amount would lend to faster&#13;
implementation of the project. Moreover, the average share of each PM is about $5.0&#13;
million to be disbursed over four years and since some of the PMs have already released&#13;
portions of the counterpart funding, the proposed disbursement schedule is considered&#13;
feasible. Annex 7 presents the disbursement schedule by semester.&#13;

4.28  To facilitate quick access to the proceeds of the loan/credit, the MOF would&#13;
establish and operate, under terms satisfactory to the Bank, a Special Account. The&#13;
account would be denominated in US Dollars, with an authorized allocation of $3.0&#13;
million, representing an average four months expenditure. However, the initial advance&#13;
would be limited to an amount equivalent to $2.0 million until disbursements and&#13;
outstanding commitments against the loan/credit equal or exceed $12 million.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the Account, supported by appropriate documentation,&#13;
would be submitted regularly (preferably monthly) or when the amounts withdrawn equal&#13;
50 percent of the initial deposit. Reimbursements of withdrawals from Special Account&#13;
will be on the basis of Statement of Expenditures for: (a) goods with contract value less&#13;
than $200,000 equivalent; (b) consultants' contracts of less than $100,000 equivalent for&#13;
firms and $50,000 equivalent for individuals; and (c) all training. The Borrower has&#13;
requested retroactive financing of SDR 1.4 million (7 percent of the total credit/loan&#13;
amount) to purchase some hardware and the software applications and recruit local and&#13;
foreign consultants to start the detailed design of the LMIS operating systems for MOL,&#13;
PMs and ZP. Payment for such expenditures, made after July 15, 1995, would be eligible&#13;
for retroactive financing.&#13;
H. PROJECT ACCOUNTS AND AUDITING&#13;
4.29 Based on the allocations for MOL and each PM, MOF would record the&#13;
disbursement made, by beneficiary, from the Special Account. Separate project accounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
will be maintained by the WBOO and by each PIO. During negotiations, assurance were&#13;
obtained from the Borrower, the PMs and ZP that they would each maintain separate&#13;
project accounts.&#13;
4.30  Audit of accounts will be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank (March 1992). An independent&#13;
auditor acceptable to the Bank will submit the annual audit report to the Bank within six&#13;
months after the end of each fiscal year. The contents to be audited include the special&#13;
account, the accounts kept by the WBOO and the PIO in each PM, the expenditure&#13;
statement and the financial statement. State auditors who are invited by the auditing&#13;
department of each PM, will undertake the auditing work based on the auditing principles&#13;
and under the leadership of the State Audit Administration, and complete each auditing&#13;
report on time. During negotiations, assurance were obtained for the Borrower, the PMs&#13;
and ZP to submit annual audit reports of project accounts, the Special Account and&#13;
separate opinion on the Statement of Expenditures, prepared by an independent auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Bank six months after the close of the Borrower's fiscal year.&#13;
I. SUPERVISION&#13;
4.31  Because this is the first Bank operation for the PMs and ZP involving the creation&#13;
of new institutions and financing mechanisms (the VTCC and VTF), the project would&#13;
require considerable supervision by MOL, PMs, ZP and the Bank, especially in the first&#13;
year of implementation.&#13;
4.32  The WBOO, the PMs and ZP would supervise the project and compile data based&#13;
on the performance indicators for project inputs and outputs. Based on information&#13;
collected from this supervision and the quarterly progress reports to be submitted by the&#13;
PMs and ZP, the WBOO would transmit to the Bank a semi-annual progress report.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Borrower to prepare and submit&#13;
such report to the Bank Group semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 under TORs&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, and thereafter take action to correct any problems identified.&#13;
The project progress reports would include the review of all the project components&#13;
against the agreed work plan and actions recommended to resolve emerging&#13;
implementation issues. Based on the year-end semi annual report, WBOO would&#13;
organize an implementation review workshop to be attended by the PMs and ZP and the&#13;
Bank. A mid-term review of the project would be organized by the WBOO with inputs&#13;
from the PMs and ZP in December 1997. The review would provide an opportunity to&#13;
revisit the design of the pilot project and based on the implementation experience make&#13;
appropriate adjustments. Six months after the closing date of the loan/credit, the WBOO&#13;
would prepare an Implementation Completion Report. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtainedfrom the Borrower to carry out a mid-term review by December, 1997 for&#13;
review with Bank.&#13;
4.33 The Bank would complement WBOO's supervision efforts by semi-annual&#13;
supervision. The timing and staffing of the mission would be in consultation with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
WBOO to ensure effective inputs and address implementation problems. A Supervision&#13;
Plan is presented in Annex 8.&#13;
J. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND DISSEMINATION&#13;
4.34  Under the guidance of the WBOO, each PM  and ZP will monitor the&#13;
implementation of the project using performance indicators designed for each project&#13;
component. Three types of indicators are proposed to monitor and evaluate the project:&#13;
(a)   input indicators to monitor project funding is provided for procurement of&#13;
goods, disbursements by VTFs, and appointment of consultants;&#13;
(b)   output indicators to monitor the number of laws and regulations issued;&#13;
registration of vacancies and job seekers, payment of UI and availability of&#13;
labor market statistics; and number of trainees financed through the VTF;&#13;
and staff trained and ESs restructured; and,&#13;
(c)   outcome indicators would measure the impact of:&#13;
(i)   policy reform on the coverage and pooling of social insurance at the&#13;
municipal level, reduction of surplus labor in SOEs, and the&#13;
monetization of social benefits by employers;&#13;
(ii)   employment services on job waiting time, improved administrative&#13;
and accounting procedures and timely payment of unemployment&#13;
insurance, and improved labor market information and&#13;
dissemination;&#13;
(iii) inservice training on placement rates and earnings; and&#13;
(iv)   institutional development on improved services to job seekers and&#13;
employers, and improved resource allocation for training based on&#13;
market signals.&#13;
4.35  Since the project will be piloted in five municipalities with varying labor market&#13;
conditions, ex-ante quantitative targets are not identified for all performance indicators.&#13;
However, indicative estimates of re-training and reduction of surplus workers in SOEs,&#13;
placement rates, job waiting time and number of trainees are given. Timetables for&#13;
completing the pooling of social insurance and the issuance of laws and regulations have&#13;
been agreed with the MOL, PMs and ZP and will be monitored. A plan for project&#13;
monitoring, evaluation and dissemination (MED) would be prepared under the project.&#13;
The MED would include tracer studies to determine the impact of specific training on&#13;
earnings, placement rates, etc. compared with a control group without such training.&#13;
Experience from Bank assisted education projects in China in disseminating lessons&#13;
learned would be applied to the pilot project. The use of a panel of experts selected from&#13;
various institutions including researchers and practitioners has been effective, and would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
be used in project dissemination workshops. The first such workshop would be held&#13;
following the Mid-term review in December 1997.  Selected project performance&#13;
indicators, to be further developed under the project are presented in Annex 9. To&#13;
prepare the MED plan to canry out the above tasks, consultants would be recruited by the&#13;
MOL. Draft Terms of Reference are presented in Annex I1. Assurances were obtained&#13;
from the Borrower during negotiations that, by April 30, 1996, it would employ&#13;
consultants to prepare a MED plan on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank and&#13;
present performance indicators to the Bank by June 30, 1996 for discussion, and&#13;
thereafter adopt the indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
5.1   The principal benefits of the project would be an improved legal framework for&#13;
the operation of labor markets, increased labor productivity and mobility, acceleration of&#13;
the transition to a market economy, improvement in state-enterprise profitability, support&#13;
for the Government's reform program, and increased individual incomes. The pilot&#13;
project is expected to demonstrate the combined effects of policy and legal reform,&#13;
improved labor market services and reoriented retraining programs for surplus labor to&#13;
meet the emerging market demands for new skills. Coupled with the transfer of social&#13;
services from the SOEs to the Municipal administrations, the redeployment of the labor&#13;
surplus to more productive activities would be accelerated. In 1994/95, there were&#13;
600,000 surplus workers in the five PMs. The combined impact of policy and legal&#13;
reforms including the relaxation of restriction on SOEs to layoff surplus workers, and&#13;
making UI benefits transferable, targeted and market-based training for about 100,000&#13;
workers, and improved employment services would result in an estimated redeployment&#13;
of about 200,000 workers by 1999. In the PMs, selected SOEs and training institutions&#13;
would be traced to assess the impact of the project using the indicators described in&#13;
Annex 9.  The project's long term impact of introducing new resource allocation&#13;
mechanisms for vocational training would result in improving internal (cost&#13;
effectiveness) and external (market driven training) efficiencies of training services.&#13;
5.2   Since the project is intended to pilot a set of selected interventions, including&#13;
policy and legal reforms and institutional development, an economic rate of return is not&#13;
calculated. Except for the policy reform agenda, which is a prerequisite for creating an&#13;
enabling environment for labor market development, other alternative instruments for the&#13;
inservice training delivery system and employment services were considered. Expanding&#13;
the supply of training through budgetary appropriations or financing training demand&#13;
through vouchers for training are possible options. Both these options were not selected&#13;
to be piloted. Solely expanding training capacities was not chosen since it fails to&#13;
respond to changing market demands. Similarly, the voucher system would assume a&#13;
free market with information and no barriers to entry to provide training. These&#13;
conditions do not prevail in the municipalities. Instead, the proposed inservice training&#13;
financing mechanism is appropriate and captures the demand and supply sides based on&#13;
competition and will ensure efficient allocation of resources guided by market conditions&#13;
by promoting public and private training providers. The choice for employment services&#13;
through the introduction of the labor market information system is also appropriate. With&#13;
a growing demand for skilled labor along with a pool of surplus labor in SOEs, matching&#13;
demand and supply with labor market information system and advising job seekers on the&#13;
required skills are critical to labor redeployment efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
5.3   Sustainability: Measures are being taken by MOL and PMs to promote project&#13;
sustainability. First, taking lead responsibility in the preparation of the project and&#13;
formulation of the policy agenda demonstrates strong ownership and assures long term&#13;
commitment. Second, the project has identified appropriate revenue sources including&#13;
cost recovery mechanisms from enterprises, trainees, job seekers, and access to&#13;
unemployment insurance funds, to help finance the recurrent cost of the training&#13;
institutions and employment services. About 15 percent of unemployment insurance&#13;
contributions, the Special Education Fund equivalent to 4 percent of total municipal taxes&#13;
paid by non-agricultural enterprises created by municipal general revenues, and training&#13;
fees and charges paid by users of employment services would assure fiscal sustainability&#13;
of the project. The WBOO and the PIOs have assigned the entire project staff-either&#13;
through reassignment or given dual responsibility-with approved annual budgets for&#13;
staff salaries, operation and maintenance, travel, equipment and seminars. The average&#13;
annual operating budget of the WBOO and PIO is about $60,000 and $30,000,&#13;
respectively. Third, the project has made significant provision for capacity building&#13;
through staff development-local and external training. Finally, the partnership with&#13;
enterprises and trade associations would have a far reaching impact in restructuring the&#13;
in-service training program and making it responsive to market demands.&#13;
5.4   Environmental Impact: The proposed project has no environmental impact and&#13;
has a 'C' classification.&#13;
5.5   Program Objective Categories. The project relates to three program objectives.&#13;
First, the project supports improved economic management through the increased operating&#13;
efficiency of labor markets and the redeployment of surplus labor from SOEs to more&#13;
productive parts of the economy. Second, the project supports poverty reduction, as the&#13;
policy and legal reforms, the development of comprehensive employment services, and the&#13;
targeted training programs would facilitate job identification, training, and placement for&#13;
the urban poor. As reviewed in the 1992 study on poverty in China (Report No. 10409-&#13;
CHA), improved labor mobility is viewed as one of the key elements in the Bank's poverty&#13;
reduction strategy in China, particularly the out-migration and redeployment of surplus&#13;
labor from poor areas to economically developing areas. Third, the project supports private&#13;
sector development, as the development of an improved policy framework, labor market&#13;
information system, and market-based vocational training program will ensure more&#13;
efficient transfer of labor resources from the state to the non-state sector.&#13;
5.6   Project Risks: Potential risks include: (a) a slowdown of complementary social&#13;
and labor market reforms at the municipal levels that are essential to expanding labor&#13;
mobility; (b) the failure of local government agencies to collaborate effectively,&#13;
especially in coordinating training; and (c) the limited prior MOL experience with&#13;
implementation and procurement in under Bank assisted projects. To minimize such&#13;
risks, up front policy reform measures have been taken as demonstrated by the MOL and&#13;
the PM since the start of project preparation including the effectiveness of the basic Labor&#13;
Law in January 1995. In addition, SOE reform remains a top Government priority and&#13;
challenge and is being addressed through various complementary interventions. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
establishment of the VTCC with its broad-based membership and constituency is the key&#13;
instrument to assure effective coordination of in-service training. In particular, the&#13;
participation of the local labor and education bureaus in the Committee would promote&#13;
the integration of training and eventually the rationalization of in-service training&#13;
capacities. Given the pilot nature of the project, this risk is well recognized. Finally,&#13;
MOL's capacity to coordinate project implementation would be enhanced by staff&#13;
development, selected consultancy inputs for procurement, development of a system of&#13;
key performance indicators and monitoring and evaluation. MOL is gaining useful&#13;
experience in implementing the social security component under the Enterprise Housing&#13;
and Social Security Reform Project.&#13;

-41-                       ANNEX2&#13;
ANNEX 2: AGENDA FOR LEGAL REFORM&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    This agenda sets out the relevant legal measures required for the implementation of&#13;
three selected areas of the Labor Law of the People's Republic of China. Implementation of&#13;
the selected laws and regulations would promote labor market development and facilitate&#13;
state-owned enterprise reform.&#13;
2.    The Ministry of Labor has requested assistance with the preparation and&#13;
dissemination of seven laws or regulations. Under the Chinese legal system, laws and&#13;
regulations are enacted or issued as follows:&#13;
(i)   fundamental laws approved by the full National People's Congress&#13;
(NPC);&#13;
(ii)   further high-level 'umbrella' laws such as the Labor Law of July,&#13;
1994 also approved by the Standing Committee of NPC;&#13;
(iii)   regulations issued by the State Council (SC);&#13;
(iv)   regulations issued jointly by two or more Ministries or national&#13;
government bodies; and&#13;
(v)   regulations issued by a single ministry such as the MOL.&#13;
The level of each proposed piece of legislation and its expected date of final&#13;
approval are indicated in parentheses below:&#13;
(A) Employment Promotion Law (ii) (January 1997).&#13;
(B) Vocational Skill Development Law (ii) (March-September, 1996).&#13;
(C) Unemployment Insurance Regulations (iii) (January-March, 1996).&#13;
(D) Vocational Training Skills Testing and Certification Regulation (iii) (March,&#13;
1997).&#13;
(E) Employment Exchange Regulations (iv) (January, 1996).&#13;
(F) Employment Training and Retraining Regulations (v) (December, 1997).&#13;
(G) Rural Migration Regulations (iii) (December, 1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42 -                       ANNEX2&#13;
3.    The technical assistance is divided into two distinct types-research and assistance&#13;
with drafting proposed legislation still at a preliminary stage; and dissemination and&#13;
training regarding legislation already near to or at its final drafting stages.&#13;
(A) Employment Promotion Law&#13;
4.    This law would further clarify some of the major provisions of the Labor Law. It&#13;
will define:&#13;
(a)   worker rights and responsibilities including the right to choose jobs;&#13;
(b)   the rights and responsibilities of enterprises including the right to choose&#13;
workers;&#13;
(c)   the responsibilities of all relevant groups for promoting full employment;&#13;
(d)   the structure and scope of labor administration at all levels;&#13;
(e)   the coverage of employment services;&#13;
(f)   the establishment of a new Employment Fund;&#13;
(g)   policy towards disadvantaged workers, i.e. handicapped persons, pregnant&#13;
women, minorities, ex-service personnel, ex-convicts; and the long-term&#13;
unemployed; and&#13;
(h)   policies towards remote areas or areas with a preponderance of declining&#13;
industries.&#13;
5.    The Law is expected to contain important provisions on a number of important areas&#13;
including: (a) whether registration at an employment exchange should be compulsory for&#13;
the unemployed; (b) the need for governments at all levels to have plans and programs to&#13;
promote full employment; (c) the need for governments to develop vocational skills;&#13;
(d) compulsory annual labor force surveys to be conducted by the Labor Bureaus; (e) total&#13;
coverage of the country by employment services; (f) the promotion of private employment&#13;
services; and (g) the unification of existing fragmented employment funds into a National&#13;
fund and a number of consolidated Local funds.&#13;
(B) Vocational Skills Development Law&#13;
6.    The most recent draft of the Law is being assessed by the Bureau of Legislative&#13;
Affairs of the State Council, and it is expected that it will be approved by the NPC in&#13;
March-September, 1996. The Law aims to establish a comprehensive vocational skills&#13;
development system, and to address five problems: (a) a lack of financial resources for&#13;
training at the national level; (b) insufficient recognition at all levels of the economy of the&#13;
linkage between training and economic development, e.g. enterprises pay too little attention&#13;
to training; (c) the quality of training is generally below standards needed to maintain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
international competitiveness; (d) inadequate policy instruments to encourage training; and&#13;
(e) misalignment of training provision with the needs of the emerging market economy.&#13;
7.    The Law  identifies government as having primary responsibility for the&#13;
development of the vocational training system, and requires that all workers receive&#13;
necessary training before taking up jobs in enterprises. Its main provisions include: (a) the&#13;
establishment of a national system of occupational classification and skill standards divided&#13;
into three levels-national, industry and enterprise; (b) the implementation of a dual-&#13;
certificate system under which trainees will be accredited by both the training institution&#13;
and a vocational skill accreditation station; (c) the establishment of a national vocational&#13;
oualification certificate system; (d) a requirement that Governments at all levels allocate&#13;
sufficient funds to meet training needs, and use a percentage of unemployment funds for&#13;
retraining; and (e) penalties for violation of the Law.&#13;
(C) Unemployment Insurance Regulations&#13;
8.    The draft Regulations follow on from the general provisions of the Social Insurance&#13;
Law soon to be approved by the NPC, and will be submitted to the State Council in the last&#13;
quarter of 1995. It addresses seven problems with the existing system of unemployment&#13;
insurance: (a) inadequate coverage-only SOEs in urban areas are presently covered;&#13;
(b) insufficient funding; (c) fragmentation of existing funds across cities and counties;&#13;
(d) too low a level of benefits for the unemployed; (e) insufficient focus on the needs of&#13;
particular groups, e.g. married couples and pregnant women; (f) no provision at present to&#13;
promote reemployment; and (g) inadequate supervision.&#13;
9.    The Regulations aim to strengthen the system of unemployment insurance by:&#13;
(a) extending coverage to all urban areas and allowing TVEs to participate on a voluntary&#13;
basis at Provincial level; (b) requiring employees to contribute, thus increasing total&#13;
contributions per worker; (c) requiring that funds be pooled at the city level thus forcing&#13;
small funds to disappear; (d) increasing benefits to 60-70 percent of the minimum wage in&#13;
each province; (e) allowing benefits to be paid to husbands and wives if both are&#13;
unemployed and to pregnant women; (f) stipulating in accord with the Vocational Skills&#13;
Development Law that funds should be used to promote reemployment; and (g) establishing&#13;
a special commission to strengthen supervision with representation of government,&#13;
employers, trade unions and the unemployed.&#13;
(D) Vocational Training Skills Testing and Certification Regulations&#13;
10.   These Regulations will build on reforms contained in earlier regulations issued by&#13;
the MOL in 1993. Prior to 1993, skills testing was mainly conducted within enterprises,&#13;
and inevitably problems arose with lack of standardization. The 1993 regulations addressed&#13;
these by shifting responsibility for testing and accreditation away from enterprises to&#13;
government, and introducing skills assessment for white-collar workers.&#13;
11.   A recent seminar organized by the ILO assessed the operation of the present system,&#13;
and concluded that, while progress had been made, the transfer of responsibility from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
enterprises is moving slowly. The new system is still not operating in all areas, and&#13;
problems with lack of standardization continue to arise because of the lack of a national&#13;
data bank of test questions.&#13;
12.   The Regulations will build on the relevant provisions of the Vocational Skills&#13;
Development Law by strengthening the 1993 reforms and the dual qualification system, and&#13;
establishing an appropriate national data bank. T hey will be submitted to the State Council&#13;
in January-March, 1997, and approval is expected by mid-1997.&#13;
(E) Employment Exchange Regulations&#13;
13.   The Regulations follow a temporary regulation issued by the MOL in 1990. They&#13;
are already under review, and could be issued by the MOL and other government bodies in&#13;
January, 1996. It is being considered that they could later be further revised and submitted&#13;
to the State Council at a future date.&#13;
14.   The problems identified with the present employment services regulations is that:&#13;
(a) coverage is limited to employment exchanges run by government and social bodies such&#13;
as trade unions; (b) there are no clear requirements for employment exchanges; (c) the&#13;
functions of employment offices at different levels are undefined; (d) the scope for charging&#13;
job seekers and employers by different offices is also undefined; (e) information systems&#13;
are not standardized; and (f) monitoring and supervision of employment exchanges is&#13;
inadequate.&#13;
15.   The main provisions are to: (a) extend regulations to private exchanges; (b) set&#13;
requirements for exchanges regarding minimum size, staffing and staff qualifications;&#13;
(c) define functions e.g. range of job seekers to be covered, of exchanges at various levels-&#13;
provincial, municipal, county, township; (d) allow private exchanges to charge both job&#13;
seekers and employers, while government exchanges may charge only registration fees to&#13;
job seekers and placement fees to employers; (e) standardize the information to be collected&#13;
on job seekers and vacancies, as well as the software, networks and registration forms to be&#13;
used; and (f) improve monitoring and supervision.&#13;
(F) Employment Training and Retraining Regulations&#13;
16.   These Regulations follow the Vocational Skills Development Law, and will focus&#13;
on the problem of surplus workers in SOEs and the unemployed. They are only at the&#13;
planning stage, but should be issued by end-1997. The drafters were involved earlier in the&#13;
preparation of the Law.&#13;
17.   The Regulations aim to: (a) standardize training institutions managed by Labor&#13;
Bureaus and other bodies; (b) give central government responsibility for all skills testing&#13;
commissions and stations; (c) standardize testing fees nationally; and (d) regulate private&#13;
training charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
(G) Rural Labor Mobility Regulations&#13;
18.   These follow the existing government policy of aiming to create orderly rural-urban&#13;
migration both within and between provinces. They are at an early planning stage, but State&#13;
Council approval is sought for end- 1997.&#13;
19.   There are three main objectives: (a) to identify which industries in urban areas may&#13;
employ urban migrants; (b) to standardize approval procedures across municipalities&#13;
regarding urban work permits; and (c) to promote township employment exchanges by&#13;
improving communications with those in cities.&#13;
Municipalities&#13;
20.   The five PMs share two common problems, growing numbers of surplus workers in&#13;
the SOEs and shortages of skilled labor. They also suffer from inadequate employment&#13;
information systems and insufficient provision of vocational training.  They differ,&#13;
however, in the extent to which surplus labor in rural areas presents difficulties, and in their&#13;
overall labor supply-demand balances.&#13;
21.  In all five PMs, the labor policy framework has four main objectives; (a) promoting&#13;
freer competition in the labor market; (b) redeploying unemployed workers and surplus&#13;
workers in SOEs; (c) improving social security; and (d) improving employment services&#13;
and training. The degree of emphasis on each objective varies across cities according to&#13;
economic circumstances.&#13;
22.   Guangzhou: Although Guangzhou enjoys a high rate of economic growth, and&#13;
demand for skilled workers is growing faster than supply, like the other pilot cities, it needs&#13;
to redeploy a large number of surplus workers in SOEs, estimated at 170,000 in 1995.&#13;
Unlike the other cities, it is relatively untroubled by pressures from surplus rural workers as&#13;
rapid growth in Guangdong province has enabled improved prosperity in rural areas where&#13;
wage rates in the TVEs are now approaching urban levels. Skilled labor shortages are quite&#13;
serious in the city given rapid industrial growth.&#13;
23.   A more competitive labor market will be established by introducing labor contacts&#13;
to all enterprises (80 percent of workers will be on contracts by end-1995), giving&#13;
employees in SOEs freedom to move to other jobs, allowing work permits to be issued&#13;
more easily in rural areas within the province, and by issuing resident permits to those&#13;
already in the city from other provinces. The problem of surplus workers will be addressed&#13;
by improving unemployment insurance, encouraging the unemployed to undertake&#13;
vocational training, setting-up self-employment bases where the unemployed can work, and&#13;
allowing Labor Service Companies employing workers allocated from bankrupt companies&#13;
to operate as limited stock ventures. The social security system will be improved by&#13;
progressively extending pensions, and unemployment and maternity insurance to all&#13;
accessible workers under pooled-find systems. Plans are also underway to extend similarly&#13;
medical insurance, and approval will be sought for new regulations at municipal level in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46 -                       ANNEX2&#13;
1996. Employment services and training will be improved through implementation of the&#13;
project, and better skills testing and assessment.&#13;
24.   Guangzhou has already introduced needed legal reforms in recent years, and its&#13;
technical assistance requirements focus on necessary research through two studies.&#13;
25.   Shaoxing:  Shaoxing enjoys rapid growth with a growing shortage of skilled&#13;
workers. It is faced, however, with a growing labor surplus in rural areas of about 161,000&#13;
or 4.5 percent of rural labor force-a proportion that is expected to double over the next five&#13;
years. There are also about 34,000 surplus workers in SOEs or only 1.3 percent of the&#13;
city's labor force, but the number of surplus workers is expected to grow rapidly unless the&#13;
rate of redeployment is improved. In Zhejiang province, the situation is worse as 5.4&#13;
percent of the labor force are regarded as surplus, and, given low agricultural potential, the&#13;
outlook is gloomy unless more jobs are filled in expanding sectors.&#13;
26.   Since July, 1994, after the passing of the basic Labor Law, the Provincial and&#13;
Municipal Governments have issued 24 regulations related to employment services,&#13;
vocational training, surplus worker redeployment, labor mobility and private employment&#13;
exchanges. The city also recently lifted the requirement that job seekers have a permanent&#13;
urban residency permit before having access to employment services. The priorities for&#13;
future policy are to: (a) improve unemployment insurance management; (b) improve labor&#13;
market services; and (c) extend social insurance as quickly as possible to all accessible&#13;
workers.&#13;
27.   Wuhan: Economic growth in Wuhan is slower than in the other PMs, and surplus&#13;
workers account for about 20 percent of the labor force. In urban areas, there were around&#13;
247,000 surplus workers identified in SOEs or 10 percent of labor force, but the situation is&#13;
much worse in the rural areas where about 24 percent of the labor force is surplus. The&#13;
number of potentially redundant workers in the SOEs will grow further given labor-saving&#13;
investment and financial rationalization. The labor supply-demand gap also worsened as&#13;
employment failed to grow in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Skill shortages nevertheless&#13;
persist, as demand for skilled workers continues to rise following ongoing shifts in the&#13;
production structure.&#13;
28.   The highest priority is to be given to retraining and redeploying surplus workers in&#13;
the SOEs, and the Labor Bureau intends to issue enabling regulations on this area in 1996.&#13;
The other priority areas are: (a) to introduce fully the contract system by end-1995; (b) to&#13;
give employers freedom in setting wage rates while fixing minimum wages as the basis of&#13;
calculating unemployment insurance and as a social safety net; and (c) to extend social&#13;
insurance. The city intends to introduce in total 13 regulations to support these and other&#13;
objectives, of which 5 will be approved in 1995.&#13;
29.   Weifang: Weifang is experiencing rapid economic development, but surplus labor&#13;
is a serious problem in urban and rural areas. There are about 90,000 surplus workers&#13;
identified in SOEs or 4.6 percent of urban labor force, while rural-urban migration is&#13;
unusually high. The imbalance between labor supply and demand is growing, although&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
skill shortages are becoming more serious given the skill-intensive demands of expanding&#13;
industries. In the SOEs, the technology needs upgrading and worker quality improving. At&#13;
present, about 11 percent of SOE employees are identified as surplus.&#13;
30.   In 1992, the municipality was chosen by the Provincial Government to introduce&#13;
comprehensive labor market reforms, and regulations have since been introduced on&#13;
minimum wages, the freedom of foreign-funded enterprises to pay wages as they choose,&#13;
rural-urban mobility controls, employment promotion and the reemployment and training of&#13;
surplus workers. The Labor Bureau and the Municipal Government intend to introduce 10&#13;
new regulations over the time span of the project, of which 5 will be issued before end-&#13;
1995. The policy priorities is to improve employment services and extend social insurance.&#13;
Unlike the other municipalities, Weifang has chosen to accept Provincial Government&#13;
regulations on contract labor and social insurance, rather than introduce its own versions.&#13;
31.   Deyang:   Given rapid economic growth, Deyang has enjoyed a falling&#13;
unemployment rate in the 1990s, although unemployment is still at a slightly higher level&#13;
than the national average for 1995. Surplus workers in enterprises remain a serious&#13;
problem. Deyang has implemented various reform measures to allow SOEs to undertake&#13;
restructuring. All new employees in SOE and COEs are on contracts. SOEs are also&#13;
authorized to lay off surplus workers. With respect to pension, Deyang has standardized the&#13;
contributions and made substantial progress in pooling benefits at the municipal level.&#13;
During 1996-1997, Deyang plans to issue implementing regulations based on the Labor&#13;
Law related to Employment Exchange, Placement of Surplus workers, Employment&#13;
Promotion and Labor Contracts.&#13;

25.   The procurement of training services and capital equipment by the VTCC is&#13;
subject to procurement guidelines of the World Bank. Contracts of $200,000 or more&#13;
require prior approval by the Bank and must use International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB). Below this amount and agreed to no more than $50,000, National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) requiring advertising in local newspapers should be adopted.&#13;
Procurement valued at less than $50,000 may be done by national shopping based on at&#13;
least three quotations.&#13;
26.   The VTCC has the right to reject all proposals not meeting its announced&#13;
appraisal criteria. From time to time, it may change these criteria and their weighting in&#13;
the evaluation procedure. Such changes must be published publicly at least thirty (30)&#13;
days in advance of the change by the VTCC.&#13;
27.   All proposals and prices must be guaranteed by the provider for 60 days on&#13;
submission. The VTCC will endeavor to evaluate and accept or reject proposals&#13;
promptly. Proposals not accepted or rejected by the VTCC within 60 days of submission&#13;
may be withdrawn by the provider or repriced at the provider's discretion.&#13;
28.   With each proposal, training providers are expected to submit a Bank guarantee&#13;
for 30 percent of the contract amount. A proposal, if accepted by the VTCC within 60&#13;
days of submission, constitutes an enforceable contract under Chinese law.&#13;
29.   On acceptance of the proposal by the VTCC, an advance payment of 30 percent of&#13;
the contract amount is paid to the training provider. The balance is paid in two equal&#13;
installments on submission of evidence of payment of reimbursable expenses. The second&#13;
and last payment is not made until the training has been completed and all services&#13;
delivered.&#13;
30.   The VTCC has the right to audit the financial records of the training provider&#13;
within 120 days of project completion.&#13;
31.   Should the winning proposal and provider elect not to deliver the promised&#13;
services, the VTCC, at its discretion, may award the contract to the provider with the next&#13;
best score or choose to reopen the competition.&#13;
CHAPTER 5: MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
32.   Training programs supported by the VTF are monitored and evaluated in terms of&#13;
their costs, efficiency in the use of resources, and the market impact of the training on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

economic benefits of the training in relation to its costs using inter alia tracer studies.&#13;
34.   The VTCC, at its discretion, has the authority to enter into an external contract for&#13;
monitoring and evaluation services. It may require training providers to maintain certain&#13;
records and make these records available on demand to the VTCC for evaluation&#13;
purposes.&#13;
35.   As part of its monitoring and evaluation responsibilities, the VTCC is expected to&#13;
monitor Municipal labor market developments influencing training demand and supply.&#13;
The VTCC should work closely with the Municipal Labor Bureau in collecting and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                    ANNEX3&#13;
analyzing labor market data. The VTCC may conduct small scale employer surveys of&#13;
skills demand; monitor technology developments and related skill requirements; conduct&#13;
tracer studies of trainees; analyze job vacancy, employment and wage trends; and assess&#13;
training capacity to identify priority training investment needs.&#13;
36.   The VTCC is responsible for public dissemination of the findings of all evaluation&#13;
studies and analysis of labor market developments. It is expected to publish these&#13;
findings as they become available to guide prospective trainees in choosing training&#13;
programs.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-                      ANNEX4&#13;
ANNEX 4: STAFF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY&#13;
A. TRAINING NEEDS ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    The training needs of policymakers, managers and the staff who will be involved&#13;
in the project were identified during project preparation and were classified into three&#13;
broad categories: (a) Management; (b) Technical; and (c) Knowledge and Operational&#13;
Skills.&#13;
(a)   Management Skills: There are a number of generic management skills&#13;
which are required by managers regardless of their field of operation. The&#13;
major needs identified include:&#13;
(i)   Project management skills: The ability to manage large projects&#13;
where many factors including people, finance, physical resources&#13;
and time must be organized and controlled to achieve success.&#13;
(ii)    Analytical skills and policy development skills. The ability to&#13;
analyze situations and develop new policies or substantially change&#13;
existing policies.&#13;
(iii)   Financial management skills.   Skills in organizing  and&#13;
controlling resources, including budgets and accounts.&#13;
(iv)    Basic computer skills. A knowledge and understanding of the use&#13;
of computers in management and administration and the impact of&#13;
computers on organizations and the way they behave.&#13;
(v)    Change management skills. The ability to bring about change in&#13;
an organization, especially when the changes are major and may be&#13;
resisted by some in the organization.&#13;
(b)   Additional skills were identified with lesser priority.&#13;
(i)    Negotiating skills. Skills in negotiating with others.&#13;
(ii)   Presentation skills. Skills in making both written and verbal&#13;
presentations.&#13;
(iii)   Inter-personal skills. These refer to skills in dealing with other&#13;
people within the organization as well as those in other&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -                      ANNEX4&#13;
(iv)    Marketing skills. The ability to successfully promote a program&#13;
or a policy within a wider community.&#13;
2.    While many of the managers who will be involved in the project may feel they&#13;
have some or all of these skills already, they will have developed them within a system&#13;
which itself is now being changed considerably. For example, in a market economy,&#13;
individual managers will need far different financial management skills and skills in&#13;
dealing with people than they needed in a centrally planned economy. There are other&#13;
completely new skills such as computer skills and marketing that many managers will&#13;
have to learn.&#13;
(a)   Technical Skills: Technical skills will be required by specialist staff.&#13;
These were well identified in submissions from the PMs and appropriate&#13;
training solutions identified. They include:&#13;
(i)    Specialist Computer skills: These include requirements analysis,&#13;
system definitions, design, programming, testing, installation and&#13;
support. They also include the establishment of networks and&#13;
application of standards.&#13;
(ii)    Train the trainer skills: These refer to new skills acquired by&#13;
teachers (moulding machine operation, computer aided design)&#13;
who will then be responsible for training others.&#13;
(iii)    Advanced analytical skills:  These will be required by staff&#13;
working on the labor market information system to provide more&#13;
detailed analysis, forecasting, reporting and dissemination on labor&#13;
market activities and trends.&#13;
(b)   Operational Skills: These refer to the knowledge and skills required by&#13;
staff to carry out their tasks. In the labor exchange offices there are large&#13;
numbers of staff who will require training when changes are made under&#13;
the project to improve the facilities and capacity of labor exchanges to&#13;
carry our job brokerage activities, unemployment insurance systems and&#13;
information processing and analysis, including computerization of these&#13;
services.  Training will also be required in the event that any new&#13;
employment and training programs for job creation, redeployment of&#13;
surplus labor in enterprises, and assistance to the long-term unemployed&#13;
are introduced by the PM authorities during the course of the project.&#13;
3.    The feasibility study for the labor market information system has been completed&#13;
and implications on the organization and management of the Employment Exchanges&#13;
have been identified. The detailed identification of training needs associated with the&#13;
labor market information system would be determined during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                     ANNEX4&#13;
B. METHOD OF DELIVERY&#13;
4.    Three main methods of training delivery are proposed under the project.&#13;
(a)   Overseas Study Tours. The MOL and the PMs have proposed a series of&#13;
overseas study tours.  Because of the nature of the project, there is&#13;
considerable value in sending selected personnel, particularly policy&#13;
makers and senior managers, to examine the experience of other countries&#13;
with functioning labor markets and effective supporting institutions and&#13;
vocational training programs guided by market demand. The countries&#13;
selected cover not only major industrialized economies but other countries&#13;
in Asia with rapid economic growth.&#13;
(b)   Overseas Training Courses. A number of courses have been proposed&#13;
by the MOL and the PMs. They have been well researched and relate to&#13;
the acquisition of technical skills not available within China.  The&#13;
institutions selected are of high standing, offering a very high standard of&#13;
training.&#13;
(c)   Local Training Courses, Workshops and Seminars.  The bulk of&#13;
training will be carried out in this form. Details of the local training are&#13;
yet to be finalized.&#13;
C. COORDINATION&#13;
5.    The Ministry of Labor will have a very important role in coordinating many of the&#13;
training activities. In addition to being responsible for the national training components,&#13;
there will be a need to ensure the cost effectiveness and appropriateness of the proposed&#13;
training programs, particularly in relation to the overseas study tours. Regular follow-up&#13;
national workshops will be held involving participants who have undertaken tours to&#13;
ensure that there is an exchange of ideas and sharing of experiences with a view to&#13;
developing best practices that will apply in their local situations. This will also provide&#13;
an opportunity to evaluate the benefits derived from specific study tours and make&#13;
changes and improvements where necessary. Specialists and senior managers may also&#13;
attend International Conferences on relevant topics, which would also provide an&#13;
opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with specialists from other countries.&#13;
D. CRITERIA FOR SELECTING TRAINEES&#13;
6.    The following general criteria would be applied in selecting trainees: study tours:&#13;
(a)   knowledge, skills and experience in the particular area of study;&#13;

ANNEX 8: SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
1.    WBOO would have the primary responsibility for supervision.  A detailed&#13;
supervision plan and formats would be developed by WBOO and adopted by the PIOs.&#13;
The Bank would ensure that the supervision plan captures the input, output and outcome&#13;
(development) indicators outlined in Annex 9.  To supplement the Government's&#13;
supervision effort, the Bank in collaboration with WBOO would supervise the project&#13;
twice a year, starting in February 1996. Bank supervision Terms of Reference would be&#13;
prepared in consultation with WBOO to ensure the required skill mix is provided in the&#13;
mission to address implementation issues. An indicative supervision plan and skill&#13;
composition which will be modified depending on the specific requirements, is presented&#13;
in Table 8.1&#13;

ANNEX 9: PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
1.    Three types of indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate the Project:&#13;
(a) input indicators to measure whether project fimds are allocated on time, consultants&#13;
are appointed, the LMIS installed, and disbursements are made from the VTFs to training&#13;
providers; (b) output indicators to measure whether and to what extent services or&#13;
products to be delivered, such as labor market statistics-registration of vacancies and job&#13;
seekers and employment data-registration and payment of the unemployed, number of&#13;
trainees; and (c) outcome indicators to measure the coverage of social insurance,&#13;
reduction of surplus workers in SOEs, job waiting, placement rates and earnings.&#13;
2.    The detailed project cost tables list project inputs in the amounts and timing&#13;
proposed for project implementation. These tables will form the basis for monitoring the&#13;
flow of project inputs. Quality of project inputs will be measured against specification&#13;
for services or goods to be delivered, as indicated in procurement and service contracts.&#13;
Project outcome will be measured in terms of delivery of component activities and&#13;
achievement of objectives for each component as listed in respective sections of the&#13;
project description. Table 9.1 presents the indicators to be monitored and evaluated.&#13;

ANNEX 10: MONITORING, EVALUATION AND&#13;
DISSEMINATION&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    China's economic reforms, initiated in 1978, have produced rapid economic&#13;
growth. Over the past decade, China has experienced the fastest growing economy in the&#13;
world averaging over 9 percent GDP growth per annum. Many state-owned enterprises&#13;
(SOEs), however, have failed to share in this growth. Nearly half are losing money. The&#13;
reform of these enterprises has become a priority. In November 1993, the Government&#13;
announced a wide ranging reform program aimed at selected SOEs and 18 Municipalities.&#13;
One of the obstacles to accelerating enterprise reform is the existence of large numbers of&#13;
surplus workers in these enterprises. Of the 112 million workers employed in SOEs in&#13;
1994, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) estimates that 15 percent are redundant and the&#13;
number is expected to rise.&#13;
2.    The nation's labor market institutions are ill-prepared to assist in the&#13;
redeployment of these surplus workers. The surplus worker problem is compounded by&#13;
excess labor in rural areas. About 30 percent of agricultural labor is estimated by the&#13;
MOL to be surplus. The current policy regarding the disposition of surplus workers&#13;
emphasizes maintaining social stability. Labor mobility is restricted by residence permit&#13;
requirements, enterprise-based social services, limited employment services, and lack of&#13;
retraining programs to meet the demand for new skills. Labor reforrns, however, are&#13;
lowering some of these '  ' to labor mobility. The proposed project would test the&#13;
impact of providing employment and training services, supported by an enabling legal&#13;
framework, on labor market development and mobility.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
3.    China's approach to economic and social reforms has been cautious and involves&#13;
extensive piloting of new measures. The project will continue this pattern by piloting&#13;
employment and training services in five municipalities: Deyang, Guangzhou, Shaoxing,&#13;
Weifang, and Wuhan. The lessons from these cities are to be used throughout China to&#13;
introduce successful employment service and training strategies to accelerate the&#13;
redeployment of surplus labor. The proposed pilot project would contribute to an&#13;
enabling environment for SOE reforms and promote China's transition to a market&#13;
economy. The transfer of surplus labor from enterprises, where it is no longer demanded,&#13;
to those where it can be used more productively while minimizing the potential for social&#13;
instability is one of the ultimate objectives of SOE reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                      ANNEX 10&#13;
4.    The project's objectives are:&#13;
(a)   support policy and legal reforms to facilitate the development of&#13;
fbnctioning labor markets and promote labor mobility;&#13;
(b)   improve the operation and management capacity of labor market services&#13;
to provide redeployment assistance to enterprises, surplus workers in&#13;
SOEs, and the unemployed and rural-to-urban migrant labor;&#13;
(c)   support the institutional reform for the management and delivery of&#13;
effective in-service training for surplus workers in SOEs, the unemployed&#13;
and rural to urban migrant labor to increase labor productivity and&#13;
mobility; and&#13;
(d)   enhance the institutional capacity of project implementing agencies with a&#13;
view to promoting market-based services.&#13;
5.    These objectives would be achieved in the project by supporting labor market&#13;
policy and legal reforms at the national level and introducing and testing employment&#13;
services, including in-service training in the pilot municipalities. The pilot project would&#13;
finance technical assistance to help the MOL prepare vital labor legislation and&#13;
regulations in a niumber of areas key to the reform process. It would, in addition, finance&#13;
the establishment of a labor market information system network in the MOL and pilot&#13;
municipalities. The system would be able to match the qualifications of the job seeker&#13;
with suitable openings and the collection of unemployment insurance contributions, the&#13;
payment of benefits and the financial management of the program would be integrated in&#13;
the labor market information system.&#13;
6.    The project would also test a new policy framework using a training fund to&#13;
improve the market orientation and quality of in-service vocational training. It would&#13;
also support the establishment of an institutional capacity to plan effectively and manage&#13;
efficiency a complete system of vocational training. At the national level, the project&#13;
would strengthen the process of occupational standard setting, skills testing, and&#13;
certification. These components will require considerable staff training and institutional&#13;
capacity building. The project will therefore include local and overseas training and&#13;
participation of MOL and pilot municipality labor bureau staff in study tours. This&#13;
institutional development will also include consultant services to review existing&#13;
organizational set-ups within labor bureaus and recommend strategies to improve&#13;
effectiveness in delivering labor market services.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Task&#13;
7.    The Terms of Reference (TOR) is to provide a monitoring and evaluation plan to&#13;
extract lessons from the national and five pilot city projects. The plan should provide for&#13;
a baseline of performance indicators for each of the project's four components against&#13;
which comparisons can be made during implementation to determine if the project's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                        ANNEX 10&#13;
objectives are being achieved. The monitoring and evaluation plan should focus on three&#13;
types of performance indicators: inputs, outputs, and outcome. Along with this, the plan&#13;
should provide for monitoring of the implementation process to determine if the project is&#13;
being implemented in keeping with its design. A dissemination plan is to accompany the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation plan enabling the MOL and the PMs to transfer the knowledge&#13;
gained from the pilot project to other provinces and cities. A panel of experts including&#13;
local and foreign specialists would assist in dissemination workshops.&#13;

Task Description&#13;
8.    The tasks to be performed include:&#13;
(a)   establish and refine performance indicators for each project component;&#13;
(b)   define and operationalize performance indicators;&#13;
(c)   develop evaluation research design with appropriate treatment and control&#13;
groups;&#13;
(d)   develop data collection plan;&#13;
(e)   identify staffing and skill requirements for implementation of monitoring&#13;
plan for national and pilot cities;&#13;
(f)   prepare training plan for monitoring and evaluation staff;&#13;
(g)   develop analytical strategy for evaluation, indicating appropriate statistical&#13;
techniques and software requirements;&#13;
(h)   design reporting system  and outlines for assessing whether project&#13;
objectives are being achieved;&#13;
(i)   prepare dissemination plan including mid-term review, national seminars,&#13;
publications, media presentations, and other measures to ensure the&#13;
transfer of technology; and&#13;
(j)   provide periodic technical assistance for implementation of monitoring,&#13;
evaluation and dissemination plan.&#13;
Development and Implementation Strategy&#13;
9.    A single, unified MED plan should be developed to cover the national and pilot&#13;
city projects and their components. The plan should take into consideration local&#13;
capacity for implementation and indicate strategies for upgrading this capacity. The plan,&#13;
where possible, should include similar measures of performance indicators for each city&#13;
to support comparative analysis of the five pilot city projects. It should also consider&#13;
national and local needs for a management information system on project inputs and&#13;
outputs. The monitoring and evaluation strategy should make maximum use of local&#13;
consultants. Foreign consultants should be used where unique technologies are involved,&#13;
not widely available in China, with the understanding that the plan in its training&#13;
components should indicate how these evaluation technologies would be transferred&#13;
during the course of the project. The evaluation of project impacts should emphasize the&#13;
use of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis, especially for vocational training.&#13;
&#13;

Resource Requirements&#13;
10.   The TOR covers consultant services, both foreign and local, during the expected&#13;
four-year duration of the project. These services will produce the MED plan and provide&#13;
technical assistance during the plan's implementation. The TOR does not cover local&#13;
costs for implementation of the plan or for related materials and supplies. Thus, for&#13;
example, the local cost of staff for data collection and tabulation activities is not part of&#13;
this TOR. The WBOO will be responsible for procurement and management of&#13;
consultant services, coordination of pilot site monitoring and evaluation, conduct of the&#13;
baseline survey, preparations for the mid-term and final project reviews, and&#13;
implementation of the project dissemination plan. In turn, each pilot municipality will&#13;
manage local use of consultants, oversee local data collection, report preparation, and&#13;
carry out analysis and dissemination activities.&#13;

            The Labor Market Development Project
            will contribute to an enabling environment for state-owned
            enterprise (SOE) reforms and promote China's transition
            to a market economy. The objectives of this four-year pilot
            project are to: 1) support policy and legal reforms to
            facilitate the development of functioning labor markets and
            promote urban labor mobility; 2) improve the delivery of
            labor market services, and training to facilitate the
            redeployment of, surplus workers in SOEs, the unemployed,
            and rural-to-urban migrant labor and thus increase labor
            productivity and mobility; and 3) enhance the institutional
            capacity of project implementing agencies with a view to
            promoting market-based services. The components of the
            project are: 1) policy reform on the coverage and pooling of
            social insurance at the municipal level, reduction of
            surplus labor in SOEs, and the monetization of social
            benefits by employers; 2) employment services on job waiting
            time, improved administrative and accounting procedures and
            timely payment of unemployment insurance, and improved labor
            market information and dissemination; 3) inservice training
            on placement rates and earnings; and 4) institutional
            development on improved services to job seekers and
            employers, and improved resource allocation for training
            based on market signals.
