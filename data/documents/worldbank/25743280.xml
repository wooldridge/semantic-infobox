Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including&#13;
its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and&#13;
combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance&#13;
terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security&#13;
Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this&#13;
provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws,&#13;

2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;

financing.&#13;

and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions significantly&#13;
differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration Agreement, or&#13;
if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change&#13;
to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to&#13;
the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new&#13;
Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or&#13;
from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
