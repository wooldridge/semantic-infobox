&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                            2&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: So, actually, as an auto-critic, I'm part of the problem that I'm now&#13;
criticizing!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, good. That's very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Well, you see, World Bank--we are economists by training, but we don't&#13;
have a real experience in policy fields and so on. So we are professors, teachers, we are&#13;
teachers at university. So we know theory, but you lack experience in practice.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, I understand.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: And therefore the very important contribution that I've gained from the&#13;
World Bank is that your theory is, has a bridge to be transformed into policy and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
A very brief example: I forgot his name, but he was a Swiss man that Bernie [Bernard&#13;
R.] Bell--but then he came. A feasibility study, for instance, project formulation. You&#13;
see, before the custom in Indonesian government is, â&#128;&#156;Give us the money. We do the job.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
But with the World Bank I've learned, â&#128;&#156;Formulate the job, the project; then we give the&#13;
money.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: And formulation of projects leads us to feasibility studies. These were--&#13;
that is a new language, a new vocabulary: feasibility studies, project planning and this&#13;
kind of thing. So that is the way I learned a lot during Bernie Bell's time period and so&#13;
on.&#13;
&#13;
The only problem--and now looking from the outsideâ&#128;&#153;s point of view--is that the project&#13;
planning and development was linked with the traditional, conventional economic&#13;
development: infrastructure, heavy emphasis on infrastructure, emphasis on agricultural&#13;
development which isâ&#128;&#148;these kind of things. This is correct, and at that time, the hero at&#13;
that time was Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Ah, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: [Muhammad] Ayub Khan with Mahbub ul-Haq and so on. So we were&#13;
recommended to study the Pakistani development plan because it was considered much&#13;
more advanced than Indonesia's. When I was planning, scheduled to go, the system&#13;
collapsed. Ayub Khan collapsed, and the famous 20 families took their . . .&#13;

                                       Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                                 November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Appraisal of the Pakistan success story seems to be not correct. And that brings me then&#13;
to the point that the World Bank is in a mode of conventional development, pushed by--in&#13;
this caseâ&#128;&#148;was it [Robert S.] McNamara . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: McNamara, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: . . who has his passion on poverty alleviation, this kind of thing. So that&#13;
that was then the whole spirit of which . . .&#13;
&#13;
But the project planners, program, project identification team and so on, brought the&#13;
normal, conventional economists: so infrastructure development, benefit/cost ratio and&#13;
so on and so forth; these are normal things. New things, looking forward, that seems to&#13;
be lacking in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So when now, I'm now in the environment, suddenly I realize thereâ&#128;&#153;s another world of&#13;
development, a non-conventional development world, and development with&#13;
environmental considerations, long-term perspectives instead of short-term, the&#13;
Keynesian economics struggles, short-term policies and so on, external costs, social&#13;
costs, internalization of this, long-term horizon, institution development, human resource&#13;
development, non-material type of development. So I'm now in that game, in that world.&#13;
Suddenly I'm surrounded by theories in which you merge environment with the&#13;
development, in which you're forced to look long term and you are coping, fighting with&#13;
these externalities, in which pollution becomes a big issue, in which human resource&#13;
becomes more and more important, in which institutional development becomes more&#13;
and more important. This is a new language that during my years with World Bank I&#13;
haven't heard about this before.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the '70s was the infrastructural, conventional type of development in Indonesia. Itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
the conventional policy type of development in Indonesia: balanced development,&#13;
balanced budget, floating exchange rate, letâ&#128;&#153;s keep this combination between the flow by&#13;
the banking system and the budget system, keep it fine-tuning and so on, look to the&#13;
balance of payments and so on and so forth. It's a very clear-cut system, yes? And year&#13;
and year you see this, because the World Bank and IMF [International Monetary Fund]&#13;
rules come together, and you have always to sign this, â&#128;&#156;Dear Mr. Doctorâ&#128;&#157; IMF letter, the&#13;
covenant, as itâ&#128;&#153;s called. And the covenant will lead you towards doing things along this&#13;
conventional type of development. So through that more or less the policy of the&#13;
Indonesian government--of course, in the final analysis the policy is decided by the&#13;
government, but itâ&#128;&#153;s actually shaped by the covenants which the World Bank somehow&#13;
imposes. Now . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Could I justâ&#128;&#148;I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to interrupt this flow, but for a minute: how does&#13;
the McNamara concern for poverty fit into that?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you. It fits very well. But McNamara is a top man. He gets this&#13;
notion, ideas. The project identification comes to teams, project teams. Then comes a&#13;
team assembled by Dutch experts or experts from here and there, so combine. And they&#13;
&#13;
                                 Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
as a project identification mission usually looks to the normal economic development:&#13;
infrastructure, benefit/cost ratio, proper policies that support this, price mechanisms, loan&#13;
subsidies, all these kind ofâ&#128;&#148;it is rather normal.&#13;
&#13;
But now, when I look now is in that price structure is excluded environment. In that price&#13;
structure is not included the internalization of all of this. The aspect of the institutional&#13;
development, the aspect of human resource development, somehow is left out.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I become the minister of environment since â&#128;&#152;78 . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Since . .&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: â&#128;&#153;78.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#153;78?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: â&#128;&#152;78, late â&#128;&#152;70s, â&#128;&#152;78. Because of my experience with the World Bank,&#13;
knowing that the World Bank is crucial in influencing policymaking, the phrase goes like&#13;
this: â&#128;&#156;If you want to have policy change, you work through the World Bank mission, not&#13;
through the departments because it's through the World Bank mission that policy changes&#13;
can go by.â&#128;&#157; And it's because the World Bank has experience in policies and has the&#13;
leverage through financing and through these famous covenants.&#13;
&#13;
Now, therefore, when I was â&#128;&#153;78 the minister of environment, my first reaction was I must&#13;
convince the World Bank that environment must be in development. There is this&#13;
environment man in the World Bank, but he is not in the . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The fellow from New Zealand?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No, no.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: James Lee?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: James Lee, yeah. He is not in this decision-making authority. I think he&#13;
was very frustrated.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is way back in â&#128;&#152;78?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Late â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Late â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: But there was this Pakistani, Shahid Husain, if you recall him.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Shahid Husain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Shahid Husain. He was the vice president. So I brought my case to&#13;
Shahid Husain. I said, â&#128;&#156;Mr. Shahid Husain, the World Bank is very important. Please&#13;
include environment into the development process.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I remember Shahid Husain said back to me, â&#128;&#156;Look, expertise are limited. We don't have&#13;
the expertise.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And so I said, â&#128;&#156;That is nonsense. You have the expertise and worldwide. Indonesians&#13;
don't have this expertise.â&#128;&#157; So [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
But Shahid Husain--I don't remember where he is now. Where is he now?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He's now in Latin America. I mean, he's the vice president for--is he still there?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB, KAPUR: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: He told me that the World Bank has no skill to do this environmental&#13;
consultation. But I had learned another thing in Washington, and that is talk with NGOs&#13;
[non-governmental organizations] . So I had a good contact with NGOs through the&#13;
Environment Defense group, the Sierra Club, the [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
After McNamara comes four other presidents, but in my judgment they don't understand&#13;
a damn about environment. So a lot of good speeches, but how to translate this Nobel into&#13;
[inaudible] And our friend James Lee was then environment but has no access to the&#13;
decision-making process, and the World Bank is divided into regional divisions, sectoral&#13;
divisions, and both sector and region have no environment man in it. So environment was&#13;
nowhere in it.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore you have this problem, the problem of transmigration issues, the problem of&#13;
this dam project, and the problem of--of course, it's goes back to us, to Indonesia. But I&#13;
face the same problem in Indonesia. And the president who supports these environmental&#13;
issues, but I have the departments who always tell me, â&#128;&#156;If you talk about environment,&#13;
it's on top.â&#128;&#157; You know â&#128;&#156;on top,â&#128;&#157; the famous â&#128;&#156;on topâ&#128;&#157; phrase. It means you have a budget&#13;
allocation, and anything that you want to add on it, like environment, it must be â&#128;&#156;on topâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
of this amount. And if you cannot provide â&#128;&#156;on topâ&#128;&#157; financing then it wonâ&#128;&#153;t be in. But&#13;
there is no consideration whatsoever.&#13;
&#13;
I was the minister of transportation in the â&#128;&#152;70s. The Tangerang is a project in which we&#13;
have the World Bank rehabilitation of irrigation, and . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Which was the project?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I thought you said a name for it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Agriculture irrigation projects somewhere in that part of West Java. But&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;m--and transportation at that time was not in the environment, so it goes back again&#13;
before â&#128;&#153;78. And infrastructure you need flat land, flat area. So what made sense, that flat&#13;
area which is used for rice production. I don't have anything about environment in my&#13;
mind at the time, but also not the World Bank. And we decided to build our Tangerang&#13;
airport where you land exactly on the area where we had our rice field project irrigation,&#13;
rice field paddies. It provesâ&#128;&#148;the important thing is that environment is not â&#128;&#156;inâ&#128;&#157; in the&#13;
project planning. This is the point that I want to put forward. So that is an example, and&#13;
the environment is not â&#128;&#156;in.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
But basically environment was not â&#128;&#156;inâ&#128;&#157; the whole development plan in the â&#128;&#152;70s, and I&#13;
had a hell of a lot of difficulties in the late â&#128;&#152;70s to get the environment dimension in it.&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#153;s in the mid-â&#128;&#152;80s that the World Bank shifted, and that shifted the whole. But&#13;
meanwhile since â&#128;&#152;70s to mid-â&#128;&#152;80s we have a huge lot of projects in this environmental&#13;
area.&#13;
&#13;
But, not only that: the environment dimension cannot go also in the sectors from â&#128;&#152;70&#13;
until the mid-â&#128;&#152;80s. Why? Because environment is not in the priority area of the World&#13;
Bank. It's later, after the big demonstration and so on in Washington, then thereâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
change. Then shift to the â&#128;&#156;Green Bankâ&#128;&#157; of the World Bank. But my conclusion is it's not&#13;
by design, it's not by vision, it's not by moving what is needed for the world development,&#13;
but it's through pressure from NGOs. This is one. And that I think is a serious weakness&#13;
of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: These NGOs you talked to in â&#128;&#152;78, were they useful then?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Oh, yeah. But at the beginning . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They didn't have much voice in that.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Not much. Both there--and I'm from the government, so here is a&#13;
government fellow talking with them: â&#128;&#156;What does this fellow want?â&#128;&#157; And therefore I&#13;
created, I developed NGOs in Indonesia. But if there were no pressures, I don't think&#13;
that the World Bank were capable of taking initiatives of how should be the proper&#13;
development in the new era. This is one thing.&#13;
&#13;
But now after this we are running very fast. And therefore I was pleading that&#13;
environment becomes an issue for the IGGI [Intergovernmental Group for Indonesia] ,&#13;
and that was successful in 1988, actually, when that report of forest land has been&#13;
developed. And then we become a subject. That was after long battle to get this subject.&#13;
&#13;
But the point I want to say is on fields where you need vision, there you have this inertia&#13;
in the World Bank. That is, I think, a serious criticism. So you don't expect bold, pioneer&#13;
changes. So, well, this is the time frame when you look to the year 2000, the World Bank&#13;
still thinks in the 1990s. It has no vision to the year 2000. Maybe the structure of the&#13;
World Bank is such because there are the governors, the members of parliament and so&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
on, which basically are always concerned with [inaudible] But this is point one, that the&#13;
environment consideration must be somehow forced into the World Bank. It is not part of&#13;
a vision, and therefore the belated action of the World Bank in the field of environment--&#13;
even the Global Environment Facility is limited to global environmental issues. And I&#13;
propose for the UNCED [United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]&#13;
â&#128;&#152;92 that you enlarge this base of the Global Environment Facility. It's not only global&#13;
issues. We have local issues like the desertification in North Africa which is not a global&#13;
issue but very crucial for environment and so on. This is point one.&#13;
&#13;
Point two is the relation with development by whom? This is also important, and from the&#13;
beginning I alwaysâ&#128;&#148;because, you see, when I started this office, I don't have a staff.&#13;
Imagine. The president told you, â&#128;&#156;You are now in charge of the Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Population,â&#128;&#157; period. There you are without office, without people. And you know&#13;
that on the next day the first group that came to me and helped me were the NGOs, the&#13;
Indonesian NGOs. They came to me and said, â&#128;&#156;Letâ&#128;&#153;s join forces. We are . . .â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So I was actually running an office which from the greatest portion, 60 percent were&#13;
NGOs. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the inclination why I trust NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This was still back in 1978 already?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Late â&#128;&#152;70s and early â&#128;&#152;80s.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: So it [inaudible] for years. But because of that experience I asked that&#13;
the World Bank projects could also be implemented by NGOs, which at the time was not&#13;
possible. The only break-through was late â&#128;&#152;80s. So after this mid-â&#128;&#152;80s [inaudible] report&#13;
and now we have a project by the NGOs. But that againâ&#128;&#148;I think that we see more clearly&#13;
it is possible, and now it becomes a fashion that NGOs are involved, but this is a second&#13;
proof that no vision, no looking forward at that kind of situation.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you have a sense that there was more of that kind of vision during&#13;
McNamara's time or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No, during McNamara the NGOs was not . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I mean, was there forward vision, looking ahead?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Quite possibly, possibly yes, but you see when the top say this, then&#13;
what you confronted are, are the missions. The missions decide, not McNamara. The&#13;
missions decide. And missions are conventional economists. They ask benefit/cost ratios.&#13;
They ask the cash flow. They ask these difficult strict neoclassical type of economic&#13;
issues. So in that frame of mind you cannot expect new ideas of environmental&#13;
consideration or NGO involvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The third aspect has to do with human resource cum institutional development. Here I&#13;
feel that we should look again forward, that here is a country that is developing itself in&#13;
which actually the capability to absorb is a very crucial issue. The big debate always is&#13;
that the absorbative capacity of Indonesia is considered limited, that we have a huge&#13;
pipeline of projects and so on and so forth. But why is that so? Because less is&#13;
emphasized on institutional development, institution building, human resources&#13;
development. So those who can--take the BAPPENAS [Badan Perencanaan&#13;
Pembangunan Nasional, National Development Planning Board] , the BAPPENAS as&#13;
today, it's the old group with very limited fresh new blood. But it's practically all&#13;
departments, and in the regions there is no institutional development in the regions&#13;
whatsoever. So you have projects in which the institutional development did not go hand&#13;
in hand. So you have your whole huge physical development projects not combined with&#13;
institutions of human resources.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What kind of institutions have been missing or lagging?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: For instance, now take for the environment, yeah? The environment&#13;
requires an institutional arrangement in the region because the battlefield is in the region.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is subnational region, I guess?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Province. It's just recently that now, with the assistance of the World&#13;
Bank, that we've boldly moved into the regional institutional development, and the report&#13;
has just been completed, 14th of November 1991. So on that there is a long battle to get&#13;
agreement, and finally the World Bank did agree, and now [Nicholas C.] Hope is now&#13;
assisting in recruiting [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What kind of institution is this in the region?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Environmental Impact Management Development Agency. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
huge backlog. Iâ&#128;&#153;m now like you have to sail, while sailing you build the ship. But you&#13;
cannot wait. You have to move on.&#13;
&#13;
But that type of institutional development is not only limited to the issue of environment&#13;
but also in the field of the regional development institutions, and this the regions can&#13;
absorb the development by themselves going down to the decentralization issue.&#13;
&#13;
So projects are good. I agree that these projects are good, but I have a feeling that&#13;
because of the projects you're affecting a social change that requires an adjustment in&#13;
institutional development and somehow [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
There are three points I feel are--my experience is lack of vision in environment cum&#13;
economic development; in NGO involvement, participatory development; and in&#13;
institutional human resource development. Now, these three are now being corrected.&#13;
And the three now are, in the year â&#128;&#152;90s, the World Bank is boldly moving into&#13;
environment cum economic development, and NGO is now possible, and human resource&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
institutions done. But while this is being done I feel not bold enough because the issues&#13;
that we face are now bigger than the involvement of these things. So other projects have&#13;
now a requirement of environment impact analysis, and that is simply that just recently in&#13;
1990s.&#13;
&#13;
But then how do we develop the capability of the sectors to make environmental impact&#13;
analysis? Again referring to the human resources institutional development, this is the . . .&#13;
&#13;
So, if I have the chance to go back to the early â&#128;&#152;70s and development, poverty alleviation&#13;
is the right target, but perhaps the nature of the development should already be with&#13;
environmental considerations, should already combine with participatory development,&#13;
should already with institutional human resource development, and that makes possible&#13;
that our development has a different character, flavor, compared with the conventional&#13;
development of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and [inaudible] which I feel are&#13;
successful but like in South Korea with a high cost on environment and a low equal&#13;
income distribution. So I--perhaps we could have done--we need to do it differently.&#13;
&#13;
After saying this, itâ&#128;&#153;s not saying that I lost hope, but for the next 25-year plan my theory&#13;
is that we must have a non-conventional type development, that is development, which is&#13;
now the fashion, sustainable development, participatory and human resource institutions&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's a very clear and persuasive statement. Has education been given&#13;
inadequate attention in terms of human resources? I take it you think it has?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: The question is this: we have just completed our census of population.&#13;
We divided into the level of education, and then looked into it and looked to the amount&#13;
of unemployed group of population. Those who have not graduated the elementary&#13;
school, the degree, so the total graduates--the un-graduates because they don't graduate&#13;
from elementary school--and how high is the unemployment rate in that level. It's four&#13;
percent.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Four percent only?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah. Then you go to the high school. Unemployed from the high&#13;
school graduates, 14 percent. Unemployed from the university, 24 percent. So while we&#13;
have an interesting [inaudible] population, and this is the question I always ask my friend&#13;
Fuad Hassan, minister of education, why we are successful in increasing enrollment ratio.&#13;
The question is what type of education do we give. And if you look to that figure, it&#13;
seems that the higher you are educated, the higher the unemployed. Of course, my&#13;
minister of education then tells me, â&#128;&#156;Look, we are not educating for jobs, so it is not, in&#13;
Indonesia terms, siap depakai,â&#128;&#157; like a dress you can always already, a garment already to&#13;
use it. That's not the idea for the education. But my worry is that we are training&#13;
unemployed high school students who don't want to stay in the village in the rural sector&#13;
and who move to the urban sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Incidentally, this is one of the issues of the youth in East Timor. You train, after ten&#13;
years there, high school students, and we are happy with that result, but they don't want to&#13;
stay any more in the rural and are not yet equipped for training in the urban. So you can&#13;
create a time bomb. And it is practically in all of Indonesia. So my question is: is&#13;
surrounded our [inaudible] education.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And you said this has been going on after some time. What has been the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s role in education?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: This is exactly what I want to say, this institution developmental aspect,&#13;
yeah, so it is not only financing projects as such, but it's a project in an web of network of&#13;
society. What do you require? And that aspect seems to be--so, if I may say so, it's like&#13;
building a project, period. Dam [inaudible] , transmigration [inaudible] , irrigation&#13;
[inaudible] . It's like an island in isolation of this networking, and it's networking, through&#13;
that method comes up the issue of environment. Environment is interdependent among&#13;
the various subsectors. Comes the issue of institutional development. Comes the issue of&#13;
participatory development. And this seems to be left out, but now it's being corrected.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Has the Bank been giving attention to this issue of the educated unemployed?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You donâ&#128;&#153;t know that. It's really striking, your numbers, particularly because&#13;
you've had a pretty vigorous growth going on here and then . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Enrollment ratio, enrollment ratio. But if you then look to the labor&#13;
market, the unemployed, the employment absorption of those entering the labor market is&#13;
very small compared with this entry [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Why is that? This despite the fact that conventional jobsâ&#128;&#148;the Indonesian&#13;
economy has grown fairly strongly?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: It's more in the urban and the change of economic structure to&#13;
nonagricultural development, but that has a limited absorbative base of employment. In&#13;
the rural sector you still see a lot of unemployment, and therefore a high growth of&#13;
urbanization. Total population, urban population, in the 1970 census was only around 18&#13;
percent, 20 percent, 22 percent, but now it's close to 35, and it will go up to 45 percent by&#13;
the year 2000. So there's a huge urbanization, and all this urbanization goes hand in hand&#13;
with no absorbative employment in the rural plus no willingness of those who are trained&#13;
to work in the rural.&#13;
&#13;
And now we have a peculiar situation, the Wonogiri Dam, the dam built by the World&#13;
Bank in Wonogiri in southern Java. It cannot fully utilize the water because there are not&#13;
enough farmers to make use of this water. You see, actually you can have three planting&#13;
seasons for around 15 months, but the third could not be done because labor is not&#13;
available. And most of them goes to the urban, to the Solo area, and the old people are&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
getting old [inaudible] Those who were young are getting old now, but the young people&#13;
don't stay in the rural.&#13;
&#13;
And that I don't know, I'm discussing this with my friend, Minister Fuad Hassan, the&#13;
minister of education, but he said, â&#128;&#156;It's notâ&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s not--nothing's wrong with education.&#13;
Education's duty is not to train people who can readily be used in employment.â&#128;&#157; So what&#13;
then? But I have the feeling that our education is too much going into intellectually and&#13;
the end use seems to be pushed into the background.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So is vocational education sort of missing?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah. In the vocational training--another project but I don't know&#13;
whether it's the World Bank, or perhaps it's Dutch--but we have this modern, these&#13;
centers for training. Unutilized centers of training. The complaint is no routine finance&#13;
to--but you check with the ministry of manpower: all these things are being unutilized.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But their graduates, do they find employment? Or they don't?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No, that facility is not being used.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, but some people are going through it, huh? Are they getting jobs when&#13;
they get out or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: I don't know, but the complaint of our staff is that these types of&#13;
institutions are not being utilized.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when I tell this, yeah, it does not mean that there are no positive contributions of&#13;
the World Bank, and you will get from other friends this positive [inaudible] What we&#13;
have reached and achieved is, of course, with the assistance of the World Bank. My only&#13;
question is could there be other roads rather than the conventional type of development.&#13;
This is what deep in my heart I'm questioning these things. Why do we have now a&#13;
tremendous pollution in all the rivers of Java, but before, in the â&#128;&#152;70s, we don't have it?&#13;
Why do we have this tremendous urbanization process while before that we don't have&#13;
this? So I'm questioning. My conscience then will then tell, â&#128;&#156;Well, in the â&#128;&#152;70s we have&#13;
bad infrastructure and so on, so that conventional part is necessary.â&#128;&#157; But what about the&#13;
â&#128;&#152;80s when we have the oil boom? And now certainly I'm promoting now the notion for&#13;
the â&#128;&#152;90s we must give more concentration on environmental cum economic development,&#13;
participatory approach, with decentralization combined with institutional human resource&#13;
development. So in east Indonesia I'm convinced there you must hit hard on human&#13;
resource development, more so than all other physical development, combined with, of&#13;
course, basic infrastructure, roads, because if you donâ&#128;&#153;t have transportation you canâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
move development.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And human resources also means training and education?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: But not the training in which you train the unemployed. So in this&#13;
human resource development I'm a believer of this participatory type of development. So,&#13;
you know, the way we do it together then looks like this: you pull a motorcycle into the&#13;
village. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a mosque, thereâ&#128;&#153;s a leader, you convince the head of this mosque&#13;
[inaudible] get him there appeal to youth, bring a motorcycle, and then take this motor--&#13;
and already not a good motorcycle but [inaudible]--take it out and put it back, a simple&#13;
take out, put back, take out, put back. After motorcycle you go to radio, television, and&#13;
motorcars. That proves that all of them pass the training have fully employment. But it's&#13;
the informal sector, see. See, Iâ&#128;&#153;m not working in the office but setting up these technical&#13;
things.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: When you speak of NGOs, you know, sort of almost parallel to the IGGI there&#13;
is the INGIs [international non-governmental organizations] . What is your sense of&#13;
them? They have often been very critical of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Okay, I mean we must--it is necessary to have--to know what is black,&#13;
you need white. Therefore I told my friends, â&#128;&#156;It's okay. I mean, I don't have any quarrel&#13;
with these kinds of, but be willing to listen. Of course they will attack you.â&#128;&#157; I mean I was&#13;
put to the court, accused of supporting a polluted industry. Of course you have&#13;
disagreements. So what?&#13;
&#13;
In my experience the reports that I receive from polluted industries are from the NGOs,&#13;
not from the government. They inform me that Industry A is polluting the river and so on&#13;
and so forth. So that's their part. [inaudible] Go on, itâ&#128;&#153;s all right, no problem, but then be&#13;
willing to listen.&#13;
&#13;
And, of course, they will tell my sins, of course. But who else may say those things, no&#13;
nice things to you? So in my country, I was told to my friends, â&#128;&#156;If I know this is white,&#13;
then if I have it black on it, then I know it's white.â&#128;&#157; So if I know in fact that the policy is&#13;
right, you must know what is the other view of this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What about population, the World Bank's relation to the other side of your&#13;
portfolio? Has it been useful there?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah, so you know that we are [inaudible] population and so on. The&#13;
question, the problem now is, however, that population is always looked as a&#13;
demographic issue, purely demographic. So if you look toward women you see in the&#13;
women fertility rate, and therefore contraceptive devices, and therefore focus on her.&#13;
Period. [claps hands] But my logic here is that while not ignoring family planning--it is&#13;
very important--but the reality is that we have on the average 3.2 children and that by the&#13;
year 2005, 2010, we may have 2.2 children, and that's reached the natural reproduction&#13;
rate equals to one. And then perhaps one generation later we will have the stable&#13;
population. So, say, when we reach 2005, 2007, that will bring us to a total population of&#13;
207 million. While you emphasize democracy is important, family planning is important,&#13;
you still wind up in having an increase from 180 million now to 207 million later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                             November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So my question then becomes how to make this population from a liability into an asset.&#13;
So not only in demographic issues but human resource development, and therefore don't&#13;
look to the women as only a subject, an object for these contraceptive devices and so on,&#13;
but how can we use her brain here--and therefore I'm complaining to my minister now of&#13;
women's affairs that women of Indonesia are second-class citizens, and it's strictly&#13;
baloney when we say that we are treating them well and so on and so forth. It's not that&#13;
I'm in favor of a woman's lib here, but women are very not well treated. You go to Bali.&#13;
Our women are doing the manual man's work with 25 percent lower payment. Those who&#13;
work in the cigarette factories, yeah, have a lower payment, and the social facility is very&#13;
bad. So it's the human, again the human resources development and how to give them a&#13;
qualitative increased quality.&#13;
&#13;
That's why this office has just submitted a law, which will be in the parliament next&#13;
month. It--we emphasize the population issue of the quantity aspect, and here comes the&#13;
family planning and so on, but then the mobility aspect because this migration issues&#13;
create pressure that the rural outflow of population into urban and that is for every three&#13;
that goes out from Java, one that goes in, and the one that goes in from outside Java are&#13;
the brainy people and that goes out are the muscle people from Java. So we are&#13;
qualitatively reducing the quality of human resource outside Java and raising it up in,&#13;
which is not already in the benefit of outside Java. But this is another mobility issue.&#13;
And the third issue is what we call the qualitative issue, hitting hard on education,&#13;
manpower development and, maybe surprisingly, religion.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Religion.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The Bank says that its major sector of lending now in Indonesia is human&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Has that been a major shift, do you think, or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No, no. What I want to know is human resource development for what.&#13;
If you build for the unit of training, high schools and so on and so forth, but the end result&#13;
will be an unemployed educated man, is that human resource development? This is this&#13;
unlinked, not linked with this [inaudible] approach that I mentioned earlier. This I feel is&#13;
somehow . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, I suppose that the labor market has some role to play there, doesn't it? If&#13;
you give skills or you can make people literate, numerate, and give them sort of skills that&#13;
can be applied in the various kinds of occupations, then isn't the market going to pull&#13;
them into activities where you have expansion going on?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: The labor minister told me that the absorbative capacity of economic&#13;
development is less than the increase of supply in the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Probably so. But your service industries haven't been growing very rapidly, I&#13;
think, have they?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: But does the service industry require that type of educational training,&#13;
education?&#13;
&#13;
So I was wondering when this Wonogiri in central Javaâ&#128;&#148;I told him, â&#128;&#156;If you have a dam,&#13;
if you can have three times planting in 15 months, why do we have not enough young&#13;
people who are willing to do that job?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Then he told me, â&#128;&#156;The young people now don't want this hoe but want Seema [phonetic]&#13;
tractors because agricultural development with this is looked . . .â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Then my question is: who creates that value system? It is not part of our training of&#13;
education that we put much too much emphasis on training intellectual types and look to&#13;
capital type of development? This is the crucial--this is what I mean, yeah, that in general&#13;
I feel the World Bank are full of people who are used for conventional development. The&#13;
development that has taken place that brought Japan into an hydro take off, United States&#13;
take off, Western Europe take off and so on, but a take off development with&#13;
environmental degradation. Therefore we have this global warming, sea level rising and&#13;
so on and so forth. That type of development this developing country cannot afford.&#13;
Therefore, I have a feeling is a different type of development.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you think there are some countries that are models for that kind of or at least&#13;
moving in the direction of this different kind of development?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: I have also difficulties with my colleagues. My colleagues imagine&#13;
when I talk this way is that Iâ&#128;&#153;m against the rapid development, the technology, the&#13;
investment of our growth, as if because there is pollution and therefore when I say we&#13;
must not add to the pollution, that pollution becomes a conditionality, environment&#13;
becomes conditionality. So I have difficulties with my colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
But [Ahmad] Mattar, the minister of environment in Singapore, he understands my&#13;
feeling, and there he is implementing it in Singapore. In Singapore you have development&#13;
with environment, stressing the human resource aspect, but the only problem is you&#13;
cannot imitate Singapore because Singapore is too small. Secondly . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They don't have much in the way of agriculture, do they?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah. But secondly it is so rigid leadership. Lee Kuan Yew is very&#13;
tough. So it has that shortfall.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;m against South Korea: that is not right, the South Korean model.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Did any of the population programs have nutritional components in it?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Oh, yeah, yeah. Nutritional intake is good. The only problem is that by&#13;
monitoring it we looked, we assessed the nutritional supply instead of nutritional intake&#13;
because intake is rather difficult to determine. So you have an east Nusa Tenggara&#13;
population with high nutritional supply because there is a lot of cattle, but not necessarily&#13;
nutritional consumption. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s why, if you look to the figures on nutrition from&#13;
Indonesia, be very careful. It is not intake; itâ&#128;&#153;s not consumption. It's availability.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I see. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s different.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Before you referred to the regions, this new--you say you finally managed to&#13;
convince this new environmental monitoring agency. Do you find that it's difficult for the&#13;
Bank to deal with decentralization in general? Have you had other experiences where the&#13;
nature of the project really--this makes it close to the people, too, with more development&#13;
[inaudible] but it requires large decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Right. I have a feeling that the World Bank is not pushing too strongly&#13;
on that, and that's the reason . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: . . the World Bank must be innovative. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the key word.&#13;
&#13;
So I feel it's not enough being done on the decentralization, but I sense the difficulty&#13;
because you are coping with sectoral central government agencies who have the&#13;
inclination to build a kingdom, to build an empire into the respective issues, and in most&#13;
cases they are not decentralization oriented. But I don't have a line agency in the country,&#13;
so I don't feel--I don't have that interest to build an empire. Maybe if I am in a sectoral&#13;
department, I would think differently. I don't know. But itâ&#128;&#153;s maybe because you are&#13;
sitting on a non-line department agency that you have this view.&#13;
&#13;
But what I see is that there is this--the second 25-year plan must have decentralization.&#13;
The problems of development in the central government is so complex. You cannot treat&#13;
Irian Java the same as North Sumatra. It's difficult. It's not simple as half an infrastructure&#13;
allocation resource and a single [inaudible] It's not just that very simple.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But it's quite close to a political issue, isn't it?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Because if you give money, you give power.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah. But World Bank with the covenants are already engaged in&#13;
politicking.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How much receptivity is there in the central government for this kind of&#13;
decentralization?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: It's battle, a fight. Decentralization is still a fight.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And you were going to say the World Bank already is in politics?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Oh, every year we sign this â&#128;&#156;Dear Mr.â&#128;&#157; this fellow from the IMF . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [Michel] Camdessus?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah, a letter, yeah. Well, the whole standby, in every negotiation. Of&#13;
course, this we don't tell the public, but before we go to IGGI there are conditions--&#13;
covenants, itâ&#128;&#153;s called, A, B, C, D and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I don't have any objections to it, but some part of the covenants are very much,&#13;
very much too conventional. Logically speaking you need a proper macro policy&#13;
framework. This is correct. But how is this macroeconomic policy linked with all these&#13;
other three issues--environment, participatory, and institutional development--if the three&#13;
are not captured through the market and therefore have no value? This is my difficulty.&#13;
So when I say environmental sound developmentâ&#128;&#148;we make, together for the World&#13;
Resource Institute of Washington (Repetto, you know, Robert Repetto), there we came to&#13;
the conclusion that we are depleting our resources, depletion of resource stock. But in the&#13;
reports, in the World Development Reports, it's so many percent rate of growth, seven&#13;
percent rate of growth, but with environment in it, depletion of resource stock, it becomes&#13;
four percent. Now, but the difficulty that I have is I cannot include this environment&#13;
element, participatory NGO contribution, or this human resources development into GNP&#13;
calculation. So and therefore it doesn't come into this macro policy and therefore does not&#13;
come into the World Bank covenants.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, the Bank has had some people like [Herman E.] Daly who've been&#13;
pushing in just this same direction.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Daly, Jeremy Warford, [Mohamed T.] El-Ashry are my friends--perhaps&#13;
my only friends--in the World Bank. The rest are the conventional economists who don't&#13;
understand. Those who speak the Daly language--Daly is complaining that we are not&#13;
using oeconomia but karamatistics, we call it that way. This karamatistics is the science&#13;
of short-term efficiency, low cost and so on, and oeconomia is long term and so forth.&#13;
They start with the assumption that economists are not preaching, implementing,&#13;
oeconomia but karamatistics is extrapolated. So I have a feeling Daly is a different breed&#13;
of economist, Jeremy Warford is a different breed of economist, and El-Ashry is a&#13;
different breed of economist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But if the mission comes, transportation mission, yeah, these are typical people who talks&#13;
about benefit/cost ratio, infrastructure development, plop, like this, and no--and then on&#13;
environment the guide rule of the World Bank on environmental impact analysis. That's&#13;
it. But how they internalize . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Are the new infrastructure projects that the World Bank is doing, are you&#13;
invited, or is your department invited to . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: New infrastructure projects?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In Indonesia, are there any that the Bank is doing that you are invited . . .&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No, we are only, we are this institutional development of this&#13;
environmental agency, and there Iâ&#128;&#153;m not engaged in this, the other. I hope that our fellow&#13;
in the BAPPENAS takes care of the environmental aspect because there's an environment&#13;
bureau in the BAPPENAS.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: They report to you?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No, to the head of BAPPENAS.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: To change the subject a little bit: in history, style is often a big part of the story,&#13;
and weâ&#128;&#153;d be very interested to know more about just how, for instance, Bernie Bell&#13;
operated and some of his successes when you dealt with him in the late â&#128;&#152;60s and â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
What was the manners, the ways in which they influenced--if they influenced--because it&#13;
wasn't covenants, not very much in those days. It was more subjective, more intangible,&#13;
and so it's hard for us to reconstruct that.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Bernie is considered an Indonesian man, and therefore if the mission&#13;
comes--but I'm talking about covenants more actually the IMF missions during the '70s,&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s stabilization more than development and they established this, the World Bank--the&#13;
IMF mission that comes, and [Frans] Seda had always these conditions for standby and&#13;
before you signed this, you have difficulties in the IGGI meeting. So that is the message.&#13;
&#13;
Bernie is actually already part of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#148;heâ&#128;&#153;s very much an Indonesian--from heart&#13;
he is committed to Indonesia. So with him, his approach is right. Heâ&#128;&#153;s aâ&#128;&#148;I mean, we&#13;
went very well. The chemistry was very good. No problems with them.&#13;
&#13;
The problem that arises are usually with missions, missions that come and go. These are&#13;
the missions, the project identification mission and so on and so forth. They come and&#13;
go, and there are sometimes problems. And in the projects there are covenantsâ&#128;&#148;so, for&#13;
instance, on the Jatul [phonetic] project, that there will be water charge, for instance, to&#13;
make it a viable proposition. On this PUSRI [P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja] project, this&#13;
fertilizer project, there may be, there should be price adjustment in order to make it&#13;
feasible. So in the projects there are covenants in which--and I understand, because it&#13;
raised the revenue. Cash flow becomes always very important.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This thing--in effect what you were saying if you want to make a policy&#13;
change, you work through the World Bank mission. That is one of these visiting&#13;
missions? Or are you talking about the resident mission?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Look, final, the IGGI report of the World Bank is very important&#13;
because the donor will listen to the World Bank more and to the IMF more than to the&#13;
Indonesian government. So what is reported by the World Bank and IMF becomes&#13;
crucial, and it is here that . . .&#13;
&#13;
So there is this aid diplomacy. The major substance of this aid diplomacy is to what&#13;
extent will the World Bank/IMF say in IGGI what you want them to say. On the other&#13;
hand, IMF and the World Bank has a leverage that we must do what they say. So&#13;
somehow thereâ&#128;&#153;s a meeting ground, and that will be forthcoming in the IGGI. So&#13;
sometimes there's a big fight. A big fight. Now, in that fight Bernie Bell is usually in our&#13;
side, and also the other man who was long here in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Russ [Russell J.] Cheetham?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: D.C. Rao?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No. Siber. [both speaking at once] This is his [inaudible] Siber. You&#13;
know him? Kemal Siber.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yeah, yeah. We're going to meet him. He came as a Fund, of course, man.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Siber, Kemal Siber. And he's also a real--he&#13;
understands us. You see, Siber is from Turkey. He's not American, and he understands if&#13;
you talk the way [inaudible] he understands, too. And Bernie isâ&#128;&#148;he becomes a good&#13;
friend.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you have a feeling about this current fellow, Nick Hope?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: He's rather new. But he's already getting [inaudible] One indication that&#13;
is very interesting is that he learns the Indonesian language very fast. So he tried to--what&#13;
do you call it--adjust with the local conditions.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It is true, isn't it, that the current Indonesian language was kind of invented a&#13;
generation ago or so?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No, it's a language by the minority of Malay, of the Malay ethnic groups&#13;
in North Sumatra.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: North Sumatra, huh?&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yes, in Sumatra we have Riau, and that Riau has a Malay. Only a small&#13;
group, less than one million. That's Malay. And then in West Sumatra, North Sumatra,&#13;
Riau.&#13;
&#13;
It has also a link with Malaysia. So there is Negeri Sembilan, it's called. That's a kingdom&#13;
in Malaysia which ancestors are from Indonesia. They all speak Malay.&#13;
&#13;
So this is only from less than two million people, and we took that as a national language&#13;
in 1928. We took that as a national language during the colonial period and not accepting&#13;
the Javanese language because Javanese is a little bit feudal. So if you are a feudal man&#13;
you talk differently to this fellow, lower, and he must talk differently to you. It is very&#13;
feudal and [inaudible] But this Malay is very democratic.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, I see. And that decision was made by the Dutch?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: No, by the Indonesian youth.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The youth?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: The youth of Indonesia were split into Young Java, Young Sumatra,&#13;
Young Celebes and so on. In 1928 on the 28 of October they merged into Young&#13;
Indonesia, and that proclaims a commitment--we call it (what is it) a pledge, national&#13;
pledge--to consider only one nation, Indonesia; one flag, red and white; and one&#13;
language, Indonesian. In 1928, 28th of October. Of course, those who participated in the&#13;
meeting were then put in jail by the Dutch, but that pledge continued.&#13;
&#13;
But to go back to Bernie Bell, he is considered as Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s friend, together with Siber.&#13;
The end result will be that if we want here and the World Bank want here, what comes in&#13;
the IGGI usually in the middle. It is not fully what the World Bank wants and sometimes&#13;
not fully what we want, and here the deliberating skill becomes a crucial factor. Here&#13;
Widjojo [Nitisastro] enters into the picture.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Bernie Bell left here around â&#128;&#152;72, and between â&#128;&#152;72 and now you had many&#13;
other representatives.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah. Come and go. Not that as impressive as Bernie Bell. People&#13;
come. People go.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We were told in Washington they had notions of--they thought that D. C. Rau&#13;
was rather successful, the Indian, that Bell was concerned about an Indian coming but&#13;
that he actually worked out pretty well. Do you remember?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah, but D.C. Rau was after '72.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: D.C. Rau was '84 to '87.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                           November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That late? Bernie Bell was here about seven years, right?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, '68 to '72.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's wrong, I think. They . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I was told â&#128;&#152;75.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#153;75. About seven years. I think we had the wrong dope on that, I think. He was&#13;
here a longer time than we were told, I think. At least, that's what we learned from the--&#13;
when we talked with the Washington office.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: In general I don't have a quarrel with the resident mission here. That I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t have quarrel. My usually quarrel is with the missions coming from Washington.&#13;
These are the bright guys, very clever, very knowledgeable, but coming in with already&#13;
perceived notion of a type of development which is conventional: infrastructure,&#13;
benefit/cost ratio, in a macro structure of [inaudible] and so on. It's that type of--they&#13;
come--blub, blub, blub, blub--go, and then develop the projects. And then you negotiate&#13;
there. But it's the question that you never hear mention, talking about internalizing&#13;
external costs, about the NGO participatory development, about decentralism. It doesn't&#13;
fit in with that type of vocabulary. But itâ&#128;&#153;s not the Bernie Bell people. Bernie Bell made&#13;
the, usually the annual report to this IGGI, assisted by them. But the project&#13;
identification missions are usually fellows coming down from Washington.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did Bell give you some good ideas?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, Bell trained me about thisâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve never heard&#13;
before about this in my studiesâ&#128;&#148;this was not my--I was a macro man, a macro manager.&#13;
Suddenly I must go to project management. So a new complete language.&#13;
&#13;
There was one Swiss man. I forgot his name, but Bernie Bell had had another Swiss&#13;
man. He really taught us--and the introduction of the [inaudible] form, which is now a&#13;
project document, is by the World Bank--a Pakistani. I forget his name.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Richard, I think that, from what you say, Bernie Bell was actually, his&#13;
substance was very much the substance of what you're calling conventional development.&#13;
I mean, it was business benefit/cost stuff; he was talking about large construction&#13;
projects. What is different is that it was the modalities, the manners, that he was a friend.&#13;
He was interacting with you all the time, understanding your point of view.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah, yeah. But the substance during that period since â&#128;&#152;72 makes sense&#13;
because the infrastructure was bad, so itâ&#128;&#153;s rather [inaudible] The issue comes when you&#13;
talk about the â&#128;&#152;80s. There comesâ&#128;&#148;see, the â&#128;&#152;70s necessarily will be heavily on&#13;
infrastructure because it was very bad. Roads were bad and so on and so forth. I was at&#13;
that time in charge of infrastructure. I was the deputy for material and infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
                                  Hadi Soesastro&#13;
                            November 22, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
development, something like that, in the office. So it's very simple. I mean, roads are&#13;
bad, we up grade. Harbors are bad, we [inaudible] But in the â&#128;&#152;80s you give substance to&#13;
where Indonesia is moving, that's a different time. It's capacity-building. What capacity&#13;
do you build, that is the . . .&#13;
&#13;
If at that time environment was firm into the mainstream, then maybe we have a different&#13;
type. Then we don't have these pollution issues here along the rivers.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: There's something about these traveling salesmen who come out from&#13;
Washington in a hurry. They seem to be able to peddle the standard neoclassical&#13;
messages better than they did poverty alleviation in the â&#128;&#152;70s or than they do sustainable&#13;
development now.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah, yeah, exact, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. At the time I don't blame them because at&#13;
the time sustainable development was not yet a fashion. There were no books at the time.&#13;
The books were written in the late â&#128;&#152;80s. Then you--after this Common Future, the World&#13;
Commission on the Environment, then everybody speaks for sustainable development,&#13;
but before â&#128;&#152;87 no oneâ&#128;&#148;well, a few--but no one really talks, so at that time this was not a&#13;
fashion. Daly is a recent phenomenon. He came after â&#128;&#152;87.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He was hired by someone called Robert Goodland.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Robert Goodland was already, but I don't think he was influential in the&#13;
World Bank. Heâ&#128;&#153;s a young fellow. He was working with James Lee. He's a young fellow&#13;
but not influential in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: [Kenneth W.] Piddington didn't work out very well, did he?&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Who?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Piddington? He was the New Zealander hired to be head of the department.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah, I know him; actually heâ&#128;&#153;s now taking his [inaudible] Pennington&#13;
was a recent appointment, the last [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He came in with the reorganization in â&#128;&#153;87.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Yeah, about three years ago.&#13;
&#13;
But Iâ&#128;&#153;m more closely with Jeremy Warford. What I want is how to get the environment&#13;
into the policy making. That is what I want. El-Ashry, he was formerly in the World&#13;
Resource Institute, as they saying, so I'm more--my wave length is more close to him&#13;
rather than James Lee. James Lee is a different type, so we did not meet. But Jeremy&#13;
Warford, Ashry, Daly, I think, I have to say greater.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But there are only few in the World Bank of these fellows. The dominant forces are the&#13;
project--agriculture, industry, and so on--who are in the typical neoclassical economists.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, well, this has been fascinating.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Powerful. Very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: But the bottom line still is the World Bank has done a lot; that is clear.&#13;
And McNamara was the pusher because he took a bold initiative to put a mission here in&#13;
Indonesia, which was never done before. And I think that can prove to be a good&#13;
example. So after saying all this, if you then ask between a World Bank mission here or&#13;
not, I prefer a World Bank mission here. It did contribute to the development of&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Very nice.&#13;
&#13;
SOESASTRO: Thank you.&#13;
