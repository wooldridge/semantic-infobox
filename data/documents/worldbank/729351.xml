            This note, which draws on the World
            Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI)
            database, provides an overview of recent trends in
            infrastructure projects with private participation in
            developing countries. Three main trends have emerged during
            the past decade. Private activity in infrastructure grew
            dramatically between 1990 and 1997, but declined because of
            the financial crises of 1998-99. Most developing countries
            have some private activity in infrastructure, but Latin
            America, and East Asia dominate investments. It is suggested
            that private infrastructure activity in developing economies
            will revive as they recover form the economic crisis of the
            late 1990s, and the fundamental reasons for long-term
            private activity, - increasing demand for infrastructure,
            sector inefficiencies, and public budget constraints - will continue.
