                                 I. COUNTRYBACKGROUND&#13;
1.      Samoa comprises nine islands inone main cluster situated just south o f the equator inan&#13;
area prone to tropical cyclones. The islands o f Upolu and Savai'i make up 96 percent of&#13;
Samoa's land area o f 2,842 square k m s and account for 99 percent o f its population. The&#13;
economy o f Samoa has traditionally been dependent on development aid, family remittances&#13;
from overseas, agriculture, and fishing. The country i s vulnerable to devastating storms and has&#13;
been hit by three major cyclones over the last fifteen years. Agriculture employs two-thirds o f&#13;
the labor force, and provides 90 percent o f exports, including coconut cream, coconut oil, and&#13;
copra. The manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. The decline of fish&#13;
stocks in the area is a continuing problem. Tourism is an expanding economic sector and&#13;
accounts for approximately 25 percent o f GDP; about 88,000 tourists visited the islands in 2001.&#13;
The Samoan Government has undertaken substantial economic reform inthe past eight years and&#13;
plans deregulation o f the financial sector, encouragement o f investment, and continued fiscal&#13;
discipline, meantime protecting the environment. The country has a healthy level o f foreign&#13;
reserve, the external debt i s stable, and inflation i s low at an average annual rate o f 1.9 percent,&#13;
in2003. The country assistance is coveredbythe Pacific Regional Strategy (Report 20370-EAPY&#13;
May 2000) which is expected to be updated inearly 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The CycloneDamageEstimates&#13;
&#13;
2.      Tropical Cyclone (TC) Heta passed within 80 k m s of Samoa as it moved southwest o f the&#13;
country on January 4-5, 2004. It was accompanied by hurricane force winds with sustained&#13;
winds of up to 100 knots (180 km/h) and gusting up to 140 knots (250 km/h) at its peak, and&#13;
torrential rain covering all the country.    The cyclone caused significant damages estimated at&#13;
about US$35 m (about 12 percent o f GDP), mainly in coastal and utilities infrastructure, trees&#13;
and crops, and coastal ecosystems. Power, water, transport, and other services were disrupted&#13;
for periods up to a week or more before being substantially restored. Although several houses&#13;
were destroyed, there were no fatalities. The extent o f damage was limitedwhen compared with&#13;
the major events o f Cyclones Ofa and Val in 1990 and 1991, due to the moderate duration o f 36&#13;
hours and the effect o fthe protectionbuilt since the previous events.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Along coastal areas, mainlyalong the north andwest coasts of Savaii andthe north coast&#13;
o f Upolu, strong wave action overtopped seawalls and caused significant localized erosion of&#13;
road shoulders, culverts and seawalls, depositing substantialdebris of boulders, sand and flotsam&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           - 2 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
across roads and into villages. Erosion and debris damage was worst on Savaii from Sataua in&#13;
the northwest to Faga in the east. Electric power lines and some telephone services were cut,&#13;
andwater services were disruptedby landslides or erosioninseveral areas. A few private houses&#13;
were severely damaged or destroyed by tornado winds in the Fagalii-Moataa area. There was&#13;
extensive wind damage to trees, including about 80 percent o f the breadhit and banana trees&#13;
severely damaged. The damage to trees i s relatively short-term in nature as these will naturally&#13;
recover and regenerate over the course o f a year. Six large historic trees inApia were uprooted-&#13;
the worst damage appeared due to localized tornadoes generated by the cyclone.&#13;
&#13;
4.      There was also extensive damage to 50-70 percent o f coral reefs and coastal fishing&#13;
which will take some years to recover. This adds,vulnerability to the coastline that has already&#13;
suffered growing erosion due to ongoing sand-miningactivities andprevious storms.&#13;
&#13;
5.      An initial assessment o f recovery costs for road and coastal infrastructure, completed by&#13;
the Government, showed the following needs: (i)     about 9,300 m o f seawalls requiring repair or&#13;
replacement; (ii) 20 km o f severe erosion making coastal communities and a hospital in&#13;
                   nearly&#13;
Savai'i very vulnerable to future storm events; (iii)   about 11.9 km o f coastal roads requiring&#13;
rehabilitation due specifically to storm damage; and (iv) other road and drainage repairs arising&#13;
from flooding, landslide and erosion damage. The assessment estimated recovery costs at WST&#13;
40.2 myincluding WST 26.2 m for seawall repair and construction, and WST 14.0 m for road&#13;
repairs and restoration. Of the total, WST 21.6 m was for Upolu and WST 17.6 m for Savai'i.&#13;
Subsequentreviews reducedthese cost estimates byabout 40%.&#13;
&#13;
Response to the Cyclone Emergency&#13;
&#13;
6.      An IDA evaluation mission visited Samoa in January, 2004.            At the government's&#13;
request, the mission focused on the impact on transport and coastal infrastructure, and the&#13;
performance o f the emergency management procedures established under the ongoing IDA-&#13;
financed Infrastructure Asset Management Program (IAMP). Limitedrecovery assistance for the&#13;
power and water sectors is being provided through ongoing assistance from the Asian&#13;
Development Bank andthe EuropeanUnion.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The emergency response arrangements performed satisfactorily for both communications&#13;
and restoration o f services. The Meteorological Office provided warnings from December 31,&#13;
2003 when the depression formed northwest o f Savai'i, declared a `blue' alert gale force warning&#13;
on January 2,2004 when the TC changed course for Samoa, and from the morning o f Saturday&#13;
January 3 issued bulletins 3-hourly by radio and faxed to each member o f the National Disaster&#13;
and Emergency Council (NDEC) and the Central Control Group, drawing data from three&#13;
sources, Le., Nadi, Honolulu, and Pago-Pago, giving greater accuracy and timeliness than&#13;
previously available. At the calling o f `red alert' on Sunday, January 4, the National Disaster&#13;
Management Plan was fully activated, with the Prime Minister's office taking control.&#13;
Government service providers (e.g., Ministry o f Works, Transport and Infrastructure, power and&#13;
water authorities, etc.) undertook rescue and restoration actions during the cyclone. The NDEC&#13;
inspected damage on Upolu and Savai'i on January 5-6 immediately after the event, and the&#13;
MWTIcompletedits damage assessment andreportedit to the NDEC on January 12,2004.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
ResponseGap and the Responseby IDA&#13;
&#13;
8.      The damage was widespread and fairly significant and, according to the Government's&#13;
initial assessment, recovery was estimated to cost about WST 90 million ($35 million). This i s&#13;
equivalent to about 12 percent o f annual GDP, comprising about WST 63 million damage to&#13;
infrastructure and about WST 30 million to trees, crops and buildings. Ofthis total, the recovery&#13;
costs for damage to roads and coastal infrastructure were estimated to be WST 22.0 million&#13;
(US$8 million).         The government requested IDA assistance for recovery works and&#13;
implementation services for roads and coastal infrastructure, and IDA conducted preparation and&#13;
appraisal o f the project duringMarch 1-12,2004,&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
&#13;
9.      Relevant lessons can be drawn from international and Bank experience in disaster&#13;
management, from other projects in the Pacific Islands, and from previous and ongoing&#13;
infrastructure operations inSamoa, e.g., Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project (ERRP) and the&#13;
Infrastructure Asset ManagementProgram (IAMP). These include:&#13;
&#13;
    0   First, the cyclone emergency has demonstrated the importance o f adopting a&#13;
        comprehensive approach to risk management, including risk mitigation. The emergency&#13;
        response system in place in Samoa performed satisfactorily in communications,&#13;
        assistance andrestoration o f services during, and after, the storm.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Second, it i s crucial, where appropriate, to design and build protective structures in&#13;
        accordance with the Design Code to take account o f local topography and wave&#13;
        conditions. Well-designed protective seawalls constructed under the ERRP and IAMP-I&#13;
        performed well under storm conditions, with relatively minor damage, and yielded&#13;
        substantial benefits through the protection o f inland infrastructure, estimated inthe order&#13;
        o f three to ten times the investment cost. Sub-standard protective structures are likely to&#13;
        collapse and may increase the risks o f storm damage. Inadequately designed seawalls,&#13;
        with either under-sized boulders, lack o f filter layer, or low crest, tended to disintegrate&#13;
        or collapse causing dangerous debris to be thrown ashore and provided little resistance to&#13;
        erosion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Third, soft protection measures canbe effective, provided valuable assets are not located&#13;
        inthe hazard zone. Sand beach, vegetation, and inland drainage provisions, can perform&#13;
        satisfactorily if there i s adequate space for wave run-up without adversely impacting&#13;
        infrastructure or private assets.      The apparent preference of communities for hard&#13;
        structures i s resulting in substantial losses o f natural beaches and communities need to be&#13;
        made aware o f effective alternatives for enhancing the natural shoreline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Fourth, contract maintenance can and did function effectively in providing immediate&#13;
        response for restoringroad access, so recent institutional reforms inpublic works actually&#13;
        improved the emergency response.&#13;

     0   Storm damage to the fringing reef and ecosystems can take years to recover - sustainable&#13;
        practices aimed at nurturing recovery o f the ecosystems can accelerate recovery o f the&#13;
        natural protection provided by the reefto the shore.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RationaleFor IDA Involvement&#13;
&#13;
10.     The financing gap in the recovery efforts i s beyond the financial capacity o f the&#13;
Government at this time; total recovery costs are estimated at about a quarter o f the&#13;
government's budget. Reducing the vulnerability o f small island states to economic andphysical&#13;
shocks i s a focus o f the Bank's regional strategy inthe Pacific. Under the IAMProgram IDA i s&#13;
supporting the strengthening o f national emergency management arrangements and the&#13;
development o f a sustainable risk management approach to reducing the vulnerability o f the&#13;
economy and society to natural hazards. The benefits o f previous strengthened requirements for&#13;
resilience ininfrastructure activities havebeendemonstrated as a result o f T C Heta. Further IDA&#13;
assistance can help restore the resilience o f areas damaged by the cyclone and reinforce the&#13;
sustainable approaches to coastal protection. The latter i s especially relevant as much o f the&#13;
economic activity and population are concentrated in fragile coastal zones vulnerable to natural&#13;
hazards, and the shoreline is being hardened to reduce the risks but with some adverse&#13;
environmental impacts.       Other IDA programs, including the Climate Change Adaptation&#13;
initiative andwork on catastrophe insurance help indeveloping a sustainable strategy.&#13;

ProjectObjectives&#13;
&#13;
11.     The objective o f the Project is to assist the Borrower in recovering the resilience o f the&#13;
natural and built environments damaged by the Cyclone to a sustainable level so that the&#13;
vulnerability of the people andthe economy to prevailingnatural hazards is reduced.&#13;
&#13;
12.     The resilience will be recovered through: (a) Recovery o f coastal resilience to erosion,&#13;
flooding and landslide hazards through appropriate and sustainable use o f hard or soft&#13;
interventions; (b) Nurturing the recovery o f fragile coastal ecosystems through sustainable&#13;
practices; and (c) Rehabilitation o f damaged landtransport communications.&#13;

  IV. INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTSAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Project OrganizationandManagement&#13;
&#13;
15.     Oversight. The oversight o f the Project would be made a responsibility o f the existing&#13;
IAMP Steering Committee (IPSC), for efficiency and synergy considerations. The IPSC reports&#13;
to the Ministryo f Finance (MOF) as executing agency, and comprises heads o f the implementing&#13;
agencies and representatives o f other key stakeholders including Ministry for Women,&#13;
Community and Social Development and a civil society representative, among others.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Project Management. A Project Management Team (PMT), comprising a Project&#13;
manager and accountant, would be responsible for the day-to-day management, monitoring, and&#13;
coordination o f the project activities. To leverage the existing project management facilities and&#13;
experience, the P M T may be attached to the IAMP Project Management Unit (PMU) located&#13;
under the MOF, and the accountant would work with the IAMP Project Accountant using the&#13;
same financial management methods. The PMT would report to the IPSC and report monthly on&#13;
progress inproject implementation.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Implementing Agencies. There are three implementing agencies - MOF, MWTI, and&#13;
Ministry o f Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) - that will implement the respective&#13;
components under the project, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    (a) Ministryo fFinance:                                   Component C.2;&#13;
    (b) MinistryofWorks, Transport andInfrastructure          Components A.1, A.2, A.3, B &amp; C.1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 7 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (c) Ministryo fNaturalResources and Environment        Components A.4 and A.5.&#13;
&#13;
 18.    Under the guidance of the PMT, the implementing agencies will be responsible for&#13;
project procurement, including preparation ofbiddingdocuments, evaluation and contract award,&#13;
inspection andcertification o f completion o fworks, andmanagement o f contracts.&#13;
&#13;
19.     Implementation: Project implementation is expected to be completed by June 30, 2006.&#13;
The ClosingDate o fthe Grant and Credit will be December 31,2006.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagementandDisbursementandReporting&#13;
&#13;
20.     An assessment of the financial management system concluded that the project will meet&#13;
minimum Bank financial          management requirements, subject to the implementation o f&#13;
modifications required for the IAMP. The PMT will be responsible for overall project financial&#13;
management activities and will manage the project's Special Account (SA). The banking&#13;
arrangement i s adequate, with the SA held at the Central Bank, where IDA funds are deposited.&#13;
There were no major problems in the flow o f funds from IDA to the final beneficiaries. The&#13;
existing Project Financial Management System (PFMS) and accounting system performed&#13;
generally well in LAMP-1, and is being upgraded to achieve full functionality for reporting and&#13;
financial monitoring. The system will be capable o f report-based disbursement, but the&#13;
implementation will first continue with transaction-based reporting and move to report-based&#13;
later when the MOF i s readyto apply this to other IDA-assistedprojects. The accounting systems&#13;
and software differ in each Implementing Agency (IA), however, the present Project financial&#13;
management arrangements cope with this and are considered satisfactory, so they would&#13;
continue for Cyclone Emergency Recovery Project (CERP) with a few minor adjustments. The&#13;
Government o f Samoa (GOS) complied with the audit covenant consistently and the audit&#13;
reports were unqualified. Details o f the financial management assessment are inAppendix 3 and&#13;
the assessmentreport is inthe Project file.&#13;
&#13;
FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
21.     At central level, the MOF will open one SA denominated in U S Dollar currency for&#13;
receiving funds from the Bank, and will set up a separate Project Account (GPA 99) for CERP,&#13;
which will be treated as a Bank Account, instead o f opening another account for the project ina&#13;
commercial bank. Any payments will be charged to individual "child accounts" for each project&#13;
component identified under the parent GPA 900 coded account with a separate GPA sub-account&#13;
for the counterpart contribution from which taxes will be paid out. The SA will be opened at the&#13;
Central Bank of Samoa (CBS). The GPA account will have an opening balance from the&#13;
counterpart contribution to CERP under implementing agencies' budgets and funds transferred&#13;
fi-om the SA (held with CBS), based on a payment request provided by the PMT. The payments&#13;
to thirdparties will be initiatedby the PMT based on approved contracts.&#13;
&#13;
DisbursementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
22.     The M O F will open and maintain a SA at the CBS with an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$0.45 m. Initially, the allocation would be limited to US$0.20 m, until disbursements have&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
reached SDR 0.80 myat which time the full authorized allocation could be claimed. These&#13;
amounts would be used only for the purposes o f the project to cover its project expenditures.&#13;
Disbursements under the grant and credit will be report-based, using Statement of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs), for: (a) grants, (b) contracts for the employment o f consulting finns costing less than&#13;
US$lOO,OOO     equivalent per contract; and (c) contracts for the employment o f individual&#13;
consultants costing less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract. Supporting documents will be&#13;
maintained by the coordinating team, and made available to the IDA'Svisiting missions and&#13;
auditors as required. The PMT will also prepare and provide to IDA its quarterly reports on&#13;
implementation progress along with Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) in formats agreed&#13;
with the IDA. The FMRs will be used for monitoring purposes.              These arrangements are&#13;
discussed indetail inAppendix 3 to this Technical Annex.&#13;
&#13;
Audit&#13;
&#13;
23.     A combined audit o fthe financial statements, SA, andthe FMRswill be conducted under&#13;
terms o f reference acceptable to IDA. An independent auditor will be appointed by March 31,&#13;
2005 under terms of reference acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
24.     Retroactive financing o f up to SDR 0.60 m (US$0.89 m) (20 percent o f the proposed&#13;
Grant and Credit amount) would be available for eligible expenditures incurred since March 1,&#13;
2004, which i s the date o f start o f the Bank's appraisal, provided they comply with the agreed&#13;
procurement guidelines. This provision would allow for the Grant and Credit to cover project&#13;
preparation activities and for the main contract to be procured in time to achieve completion by&#13;
the end o f 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Project Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
25.     Under the parallel IAMP, the national emergency management arrangements are being&#13;
strengthened and a sustainable risk management approach i s being implemented to reduce the&#13;
vulnerability o f the economy and society to natural hazards.        The benefits of strengthened&#13;
requirements for resilience in coastal infrastructure have been demonstrated under TC Heta. The&#13;
Project assistance will help restore the resilience o f areas damaged by the cyclone and reinforce&#13;
the sustainable approaches to coastal protection. MNREwill complete the preparation o f Coastal&#13;
Infrastructure (Risk) Management Plans (CIM Plans) under IAMP, and will need to reinforce&#13;
compliance with the plans and raise awareness at both local and national levels for these C I M&#13;
Plans to be effective.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
&#13;
26.     Environmental impacts under the Project range from negligible to substantial, as the&#13;
activities involve a range of structural and non-structural interventions inthe fragile coastal zone&#13;
to protect economic and natural assets. An Environmental Policy Framework, based on that&#13;
approved for the IAMP in November 2003, establishes rules and procedures to be followed&#13;
under the Project with regard to environmental assessment, monitoring and mitigation of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 9 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
potential negative impacts (see Appendix 5).          GOS environmental legislation and draft&#13;
regulations satisfy the requirements of World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.01).&#13;
Environmental assessment of project components shall be undertaken in accordance with the&#13;
procedures set out inthe draft EIA Regulations 1998. Inthe coastal marine eco-system, Project&#13;
activities are designed to help the eco-system recover from the damage which occurred during&#13;
Cyclone Heta and so are expected to have beneficial impacts. A set o f operating procedures for&#13;
routine smaller projects with minimal environmental impacts is based on a set o f Codes o f&#13;
Environmental Practice (COEPs) which guide and control the ways in which environmental&#13;
aspects o f all civil engineering works and the private sector are managed and addressed. When&#13;
the scope o f the project cannot be handled by implementation o f a COEP a sub-project with&#13;
some adverse environmental impacts (i.e., a Category B project) shall be the subject o f an&#13;
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which can stand on its own or be an integral part o f the&#13;
Project Implementation Plan(PIP).&#13;
&#13;
27.     Social impacts o f the Project will generally be positive due to the restored and improved&#13;
resilience to the natural hazards of erosion, flooding and landslides. However, some impacts&#13;
such as those on tourism, local fishing industry, and other coastal activities, may be mixed and&#13;
may warrant investigation and review through the consultation framework which had been&#13;
established for the IAMP.&#13;
&#13;
PotentialLandTenureIssues&#13;
&#13;
28.     Works will be undertaken generally on public land andno land acquisition is anticipated.&#13;
A Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF),based on that established for IAMP,&#13;
would be applied ifcompensation were needed (see Appendix 6).&#13;
&#13;
ParticipatoryApproach&#13;
&#13;
29.     The development o f the District-level Coastal Infrastructure Management Plans (CIM&#13;
Plans), on which the natural risk management approach is based, has involved substantial&#13;
participation and consultation among affected communities, led by the MNRE. The&#13;
investigation and design activities proposed under the Project will follow the provisions o f the&#13;
ConsultationFramework established under the IAMP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            V. PROJECTBENEFITS AND FUSKS&#13;
&#13;
ProjectBenefits&#13;
&#13;
30.     There are various direct and indirect sources o f benefits from the project. Indirect&#13;
benefits due to improved resilience to natural hazards will accrue only during a hazard event.&#13;
Recent estimates o f the benefits arising from the previous construction o f protection structures,&#13;
range from about 3- to 10-times the cost o f investment, including public and private assets.&#13;
Indirect benefits include the conservation o f land resources. Benefits from the recovery o f the&#13;
coastal eco-system are indirect to the communities, but are typically multiple in effect: healthy&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 10-&#13;
&#13;
reef systems dissipate wave energy and enlarge fish stocks, shoreline vegetation including&#13;
mangroves provide stabilization, andthe net effect canbe reduced vulnerability to storm hazards.&#13;
&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
&#13;
31.    Pressure from coastal communities can typically focus on structural treatments such as&#13;
rock walls because o f a perception o f more durable and effective protection. Recent experience&#13;
inSamoa and other tropical islandcountries shows that this can leadto substantial hardening of&#13;
the coastline and loss o f the natural shoreline environment.     Under-designed structures can&#13;
disintegrate and increase the risks o f damage during an emergency event.         Reclamations or&#13;
material extraction and other modifications o f the shoreline can change patterns o f erosion or&#13;
aggradation and may increase risks. Community and political pressures for quick solutions may&#13;
deter efforts to establish a sustainable approach to improving coastal resilience.&#13;

&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.      Tropical Cyclone Heta moved southwest o f Samoa on January 4-5, 2004, accompanied&#13;
by hurricane force winds with sustained winds o f up to 100 knots (180 Wh) and gustingup to&#13;
140 knots (250 Wh) at its peak, and torrential rain covering all the country.         The cyclone&#13;
caused significant damages estimated at about US$35 m (about 12 percent o f GDP), mainly in&#13;
trees, crops and coastal infrastructure.    However, the extent o f damage was limited when&#13;
compared with the major events o f Cyclones Ofa and Val in 1990 and 1991, due to the moderate&#13;
duration o f 36 hours and the effect of the protectionbuilt since the previous events. Without the&#13;
previous investments, the infrastructure damage i s likely to have been five to eight times higher,&#13;
inthe orderofabout $200 m.&#13;
&#13;
2.      For infrastructure along coastal areas, mainly along the north and west coasts o f Savai'i&#13;
and the north coast of Upolu, strong wave action overtopped seawalls and caused significant&#13;
localized erosion o f road shoulders, culverts and seawalls, depositing substantial debris o f&#13;
boulders, sand and flotsam across roads and into villages. Erosion and debris damage was worst&#13;
on Savai'i from Sataua inthe northwest to Fagainthe east.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Government's assessment o f recovery costs for road and coastal infrastructure&#13;
(MWTI, January 2004), was WST 40.8 m (US$ 14.8 m) comprising: (i) 9,300 m o f   about&#13;
seawalls requiring repair or replacement; (ii)   nearly 20 km o f severe erosion making coastal&#13;
communities and a hospital inSavai'i very vulnerable to future storm events; (iii) 11.9 km&#13;
                                                                                    about&#13;
o f coastal roads requiringrehabilitation due specifically to storm damage; and(iv) other road and&#13;
drainage repairs arisingfrom flooding, landslide and erosion damage.&#13;
&#13;
4.      An IDA mission identified a smaller core program o f recovery actions of about US$ 6 m&#13;
including civil works and related services. The need for risk mitigation actions to be sustainable,&#13;
identified within the context o f the Coastal Infrastructure Management Strategy and individual&#13;
District Plans and include non-structural options was emphasized. The majority o f the proposed&#13;
works are in districts where coastal management plans have already been developed under the&#13;
IAMP. These locally agreed frameworks could also be used as reference in cases where these&#13;
plansare not yet inplace.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The storm was equivalent to a 15-20 year event, which exceeds the design return period&#13;
adopted for previous emergency recovery works, and is at or above the design standard&#13;
commonly adopted under IAMP.           Damages are therefore expected to be moderate where&#13;
protection has been afforded but substantial in other areas at risk.       The seawalls and other&#13;
protective measures constructed under the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project (ERRP) and&#13;
the recent first phase of the IAMP generally performed well and sustained relatively minor&#13;
damage. There has also been considerable construction o f seawalls recently outside the E W&#13;
and IAMP, supported under either Government budget or privately. However, in many cases&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
those walls, and some o f older design, had disintegrated and the undersized boulders became an&#13;
additional hazard as part o f the debris washed inland. Along the northem Savai'i coast, there&#13;
was substantial aggradation of beach sand inseveral areas, illustrating that erosion is not the sole&#13;
mechanism o f damage and that alternative mitigation measures, e.g., soft or non-structural&#13;
options, need to be considered.        Table 1 compares the extent o f existing seawalls, recent&#13;
construction, and appraisal estimates o fthe length requiring rehabilitation or reconstruction.&#13;

PreviousEmergencyandSustainableManagementProjects&#13;
&#13;
6.      Previous cyclone emergency response projects completed in Samoa have included the&#13;
ERRP, finished in the aftermath o f Cyclones Ofa and Val, and the corresponding support&#13;
provided through the ADB.           These emergency response projects provided the basis for&#13;
introducing shoreline protection systems designed and implemented according international best&#13;
practice. The first phase o f the IAMP, which was developed after the successful completion o f&#13;
the ERRP, was the vehicle for introducing a robust approach to risk management in the coastal&#13;
hazard zone that is now being integrated into the activities of MNRE and MWTI. The outcome&#13;
has been the establishment o f effective environmental management and coastal risk management&#13;
processes for Samoa, which need strengthening but are already being promoted as a model for&#13;
other developing countries in the Pacific. This environmental and risk management framework,&#13;
and the principles on which it is based, has guided many o f the decisions andproposed approach&#13;
inthe designofthe currentproject. Theseprinciples include:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Environmental management o f all emergency works;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Application o f the CIM Strategy and C I M Plans as guiding documents on the allowable&#13;
       nature and extent o f infrastructure development inthe coastal zone.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Sound technical, economic and risk management-based decision-making relating to&#13;
        infrastructure development inthe coastal zone.&#13;

&#13;
ComponentObjective&#13;
&#13;
7.       The project design presented here for the CoastalRecovery component o f CERP has been&#13;
developed from the work done during the IDA Mission of January 13-16, 2004 (Aide Memoire,&#13;
January 2004), and outlined hrther inthe Project InformationDocument (2004) and Project Concept&#13;
Note (2004). However, the elements o f the project have been adapted to clearly emphasize the&#13;
principles for sustainable development in the coastal hazard zone as set out in the C I M Strategy&#13;
developed under IAMP (and where available, the CIM Plans), and to incorporate a wider range o f&#13;
recovery and resilience initiatives withinthe coastal zone.&#13;
&#13;
     (a) The objective for the CERP i s that:&#13;
&#13;
     The resilience against natural hazards of the infrastructure assets, livelihood of&#13;
     inhabitants and coastal eco-systems, impacted by Cyclone Heta, will be recovered and&#13;
     improved to sustainable levels with due safeguards for the natural environment.&#13;
&#13;
     (b) More detailed output goals for the CERP arethat:&#13;
&#13;
         -   Coastal rehabilitation works are sustainable andfollow the best practice approachesfor&#13;
             assessment, design, implementation, environmental management and natural risk&#13;
             management developed under IAMP.&#13;
         -   Community and GoS recovery activities are consistent with the CIM Strategy and CIM&#13;
             Plans where available.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentDescription&#13;
&#13;
8.       A core program o frecovery measures, focused mainly on the restoration and improvement of&#13;
coastal resilience, plus some restoration and rehabilitation of roads, i s proposed.           Coastal&#13;
rehabilitation measures are proposed to include repair and reconstruction o f coastal structural&#13;
systems to restore selected coastal infrastructure to levels o f service standards adopted under IAMP.&#13;
It is also proposed that, at some sites, rehabilitation should involve non-structural works where this&#13;
supports the development goals (e.g. tourism and/or community preferences) for the affected area&#13;
and/or technical criteria point to such an approach as being the preferred coastal hazard reduction&#13;
treatment. The CERP also provides an opportunity to ensure that the vision and principles set out in&#13;
the CIM Strategy are achieved, and that applicable coastal resilience initiatives identifiedinthe CIM&#13;
Plans are implementedat both GoS and local community levels for sites selectedfor treatment under&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Although a significant proportion o f the works and activities under the project will relate&#13;
to GoS coastal infrastructure, Cyclone Heta also affected infrastructure, heritage, land, natural&#13;
resources (including eco-systems) and developed resources on customary land managed by&#13;
village communities.      It is therefore proposed to support community lead initiatives for&#13;
rehabilitation works or activities that meet the objective and output goals for the project. These&#13;
works or activities will involve a partnership between the GoS and approved village&#13;
communities, in which the GoS will provide funds for materials, and the communities will&#13;
undertake the planning and provide labor or assistance inkind, to implement the initiatives. It is&#13;
also proposed to provide for specialized technical services to monitor the recovery o f coastal&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       - 14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
eco-systems, and to develop strategies and implementation approaches to aid the recovery o f&#13;
these systems at selected sites.&#13;
&#13;
10.        Coastal environments are ecologically fragile and vulnerable to natural hazards. At the&#13;
same time, the ecological and physical disturbances cause by extreme natural events is part o f&#13;
their natural ecological cycle o f regeneration and renewal. Natural ecosystems thus have innate&#13;
mechanisms for renewal and adaptation that ensures their re-growth and restoration.&#13;
Furthermore, these mechanisms and processes can be influenced and resilience and restoration&#13;
accelerated when favorable environmental conditions are created by extemal interventions. The&#13;
Coastal Resilience component aims to support such interventions.&#13;
&#13;
11.         Professional services will be required to provide technical, administrative, implementation&#13;
assistancein relation to the above recovery initiatives to support needs o f MWTIand MNRE intheir&#13;
respective roles under the project. Both MWTI and MNRE will provide counterpart inputs, but&#13;
departmental, overall project management and financial management will be achieved through an&#13;
extension o f existing or proposed arrangements under IAMP to avoid duplication o f effort.&#13;
Similarly, for efficiency reasons, wherever possible and appropriate, administrative procedures,&#13;
processes, systems, guidelinesand implementation methodologies, already developed under IAMP or&#13;
IAMP, will be applied under CERP.&#13;
&#13;
12.        The environmental assessment procedures of the Environmental Policy Framework (EPF,&#13;
Appendix 5) and the Government's draft EIA Regulation will apply to all works and activities under&#13;
CERP in the manner required under IAMP. The mandatory requirements o f the newly enacted&#13;
Planning and Urban Management Act, 2004, will also apply. Furthermore, it i s proposed that CIM&#13;
Plans will be applied under the project as if they where enforceable Sustainable Management Plans&#13;
underthe Act.'&#13;
&#13;
13.        Although extensive use o f the IAMP framework will be used, it is emphasised that the&#13;
CERP is a separateproject, and that the activities to not overlap or duplicate activities under&#13;
I M P . The proposedtask activities to achieve the above described project outline are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
&#13;
A.         CoastalResilience Recovery&#13;
&#13;
14.        Coastal protection works were damaged or failed at a number o f sites, especially on the&#13;
northern sides o f Upolu and Savai'i.               On the whole, works that were implemented based on&#13;
international good practice as part o f the Cyclones Ofa and Val rehabilitationprogrammes under the&#13;
auspices o f the IDA and ADB performed satisfactorily. Loss o f riprap and washout o f adjacent road&#13;
segments was often limitedto isolated failures over short segments, as detailed inthe MWTI damage&#13;
assessment report o f January 5-7, 2004. However, the immediate emergency response to many o f&#13;
these localised failures was to back-tip material back into the eroded segments without appropriate&#13;
grading o f materials, use o f structural and filter layers, and toe and crest detailing. It i s often the&#13;
proper implementation o f such details that ensures that the desired levels o f service are achieved&#13;
duringdesign events. It is appropriate at sites where failures occurred that structural coastal defence&#13;
works be restored to achieve the desired levels o f service under fiture storm events. Inthe following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 It is likely that the existingCIMPlans, preparedunder IAMP, andpossiblysome of the CIM Plans completedin the first year of&#13;
      IAMP, will officially becomeSMPs under the PLJMAct within the durationofthe CERP.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               - 15 -&#13;
&#13;
task descriptions, a distinction has been made between: (i) where repair works are required to&#13;
                                                               sites&#13;
properly restore the armour layers; (ii)  sites where it would be preferable to completely remove and&#13;
interim works and reconstruct the underlying core fill material, and overlying filter and structural&#13;
layers; and (iii) sites where, due to natural circumstances, a non-structural or `soft' treatment would&#13;
be appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Structural Rehabilitation (Task Al):      This task covers the rehabilitation o f sites where&#13;
existing coastal riprap works require light to heavy maintenance o f denuded armour layers inorder to&#13;
bring the site back up to an adequate standard. Such works are expected to cover short lengths o f&#13;
riprap shoreline defence systems (i.e. 10-100 m) where local deterioration, and the current residual&#13;
risks to the adjacent infrastructure warrant an intervention above the standard o f repair achieved&#13;
immediately post-cyclone.&#13;
&#13;
16.      Structural Replacement (Task A2): This task covers the partial to full dismantling o f interim&#13;
repair works, and reconstruction o f the structural system, to ensure an adequate level o f service inthe&#13;
future. This type o f intervention will bejustified at locations where the current residual risks to the&#13;
adjacent infrastructure are significant and warrant the level o f investment. Such works are expected&#13;
to cover mediumlengths o f riprap shoreline defence systems (i.e. 50-200 m).&#13;
&#13;
17.      It is proposed that there would also be considerable benefits in taking advantage o f the&#13;
opportunity presented by the CERP to experiment with alternative forms o f structural defence&#13;
systems that have the potential to contribute at least the same or higher level o f coastal resilience as&#13;
traditional shore protection systems, but which offer either cost efficiencies, or improve recreational,&#13;
ecological or customary land use values. Examples o f such alternatives might include inter alia&#13;
artificial submerged reefs, detached breakwaters and headland control. The experience gained from&#13;
adoption o f at least some experimental sites would, over say a 10-year timeframe, contribute to the&#13;
body o f knowledge on the practical performance o f a variety o f shoreline defence systems in low&#13;
lying, sensitive atoll environments. Such an approach would be confined to one or two carehlly&#13;
selected sites under the CERP where the potential benefits can be demonstrated, but the risks&#13;
associated with the uncertainty inlong-term performance can also be accepted.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Non-structural Rehabilitation (Task A3): It will be appropriate to implement non-structural&#13;
coastal hazard reduction treatments at some sites where this supports the development goals for the&#13;
affected area (e.g. tourism andor community preferences) and/or technical criteria point to such an&#13;
approach as beingthe preferred option. Examples o f such treatments might include inter alia beach&#13;
nourishment, stabilised dune systems, geotextile systems and combinations o f the preceding list. Iti s&#13;
proposed that several sites be identified and reserved for this type o f treatment under the project.&#13;
&#13;
The map outlining the location andpriority shoreline protection rehabilitation andreplacement works&#13;
i s included at the end o f document. This map also shows the proposed sites relative to the Districts&#13;
for which CIM Plans have been prepared. It is emphasised that the locations and priority ratings&#13;
works are very preliminary, and need to be confirmed or developed further after more detailed&#13;
assessment.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Small-scale Resilience Strengthening (Task A4): There are numerous options for enhancing&#13;
the resilience o f coastal environments, and for accelerating ecosystem restoration, involving small-&#13;
scale, low-cost schemes to be implemented through local community groups or NGO's. Such options&#13;
enhance the protection and restoration o f coastal infrastructure, as well as community and private&#13;
assets. Examples o f such activities are coastal re-vegetation and replanting schemes, the enforcement&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
o f village bans on sand-mining, the use o f no-take zones to regulate the harvesting o f live corals, the&#13;
control o f crown-of-thorns, community awareness and education. Such initiatives accelerate coastal&#13;
ecosystems recoverythereby improvingprotection o f coastal resources and communities.&#13;
&#13;
To be eligible, activities must be able to be linked to effects arising from Cyclone Heta. The&#13;
following focal areas constitute the broad scope from which eligible activities and projects will be&#13;
selected:&#13;
&#13;
         0   Enhancement o f coastal protection processes&#13;
         0   Rehabilitationo f coastal and marine ecosystems and habitats&#13;
         0   Sustainable coastal ecosystems and resources management&#13;
         0   Riskreductionandrestorationmeasures for vulnerable communal assets&#13;
         0   Community awareness raising and education for hazardmanagement&#13;
&#13;
Works and activities that do not contribute directly to the restoration coastal infrastructure,&#13;
community assets and natural resources, to improve resilience to cyclones, will not be eligible.&#13;
Examples o f ineligible activities will include:&#13;
&#13;
         0   Hiringo fequipment for the repair or construction o faccessroads.&#13;
         0   Activities seeking support for privately ownedproperty and or profit-based ventures.&#13;
         0   Procurement o f capital assets such as vehicles, outboard motors etc. or the payment o f&#13;
             wages, fees or allowances to recipients and projectbeneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
20.      It is proposed that funds for community-based activities will be disbursed through a Small&#13;
Grant Scheme, to be administered by MNRE. Community proposals for project support will be&#13;
solicited appropriately and will be evaluated and approved based on defined criteria. The scheme&#13;
will be implemented and administered by a full time Small Grants Scheme Manager operating under&#13;
the auspices o f P U M A (Planning and Urban Management Agency). This manager will coordinate&#13;
activities to promote public awareness o f the scheme, solicit project proposals from eligible parties,&#13;
coordinate their evaluation with technical support from others in MNRE, prepare evaluation reports&#13;
and technical recommendations to a select committee for approval, and undertake monitor and&#13;
reportingon progress inproject implementation.&#13;
&#13;
21.      PUMA will provide administrative and logistics support for the scheme. The Scheme&#13;
Manager will also be expected to draw on the technical expertise from within MNRE for support and&#13;
assistance inthe technical evaluation o fproposals. The administrative processes for the Small Grants&#13;
Scheme will be fully harmonised with those to be applied for a similar scheme under IAMP.&#13;
&#13;
22.      Coastal Eco-systems Recovery (Task A5): Coastal ecosystems such as fringing coral reefs,&#13;
lagoon flats, mangrove stands, etc. play key roles incoastal protection against the impact o f cyclones&#13;
and similar natural events. This task i s aimed at contributing to the restoration o f such systems.&#13;
Activities will involve: (i) assessment surveys o f selected reef, lagoon and mangrove areas; (ii)&#13;
                            rapid&#13;
data analyses and mapping to highlight areas o f high vulnerability and resilience; (iii)    community&#13;
consultation; and (iv) development and implementation o f site-level recovery plans. Data will also&#13;
be used to update existingC I M Plans and to assist inthe compilation o fnew plans under IAMP.&#13;
&#13;
23.      Task A5 will also strengthen M N R E ' s technical advisory capacity to proactively assist&#13;
developers make ecologically sustainable decisions. Activities will include: (i)information&#13;
packaging and dissemination so that village communities can make informed decisions about&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               - 17-&#13;
&#13;
recovery interventions or restraints; (ii) facilitation o f community consultation; and (iii)provision o f&#13;
technical advice. P U M A will coordinate the procurement o f expert services for the implementation&#13;
of post-cyclone assessment inselected marine areas.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The IUCN/World Bank Aleipata and Safata MPAs are expected to be included as sites to be&#13;
assessed underthis task. It i s also notedthat the roofo f Aleipata MPA Regional Centre buildingwas&#13;
damaged during Cyclone Heta, and needs repair. This building, used for District meetings and&#13;
community consultation, i s crucial to supporting the successful operation and enforcement o f the&#13;
MPA. It i s proposed to arrange repair o f the building under the project. However, as important&#13;
structural elements o f the building, constructed under a community initiative, were not made o f&#13;
durable materials or cyclone resistant detailing, it i s proposed to upgrade these features to ensure that&#13;
the investment in the roof repairs is worthwhile. This will involve professional engineering design&#13;
and specification, although implementation o f the repairs may still be carried out based on&#13;
community labour.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Road Infrastructure Recovery&#13;
&#13;
25.     Road and Drainage Rehabilitation (Task Bl): National roads, drainage structures and&#13;
roadside furniture, including crash barriers, were washed out or damaged at a number o f locations.&#13;
Damaged ranged from seal stripping through to undercutting o f the road sub-grade, and dislocation&#13;
of culverts and headwalls. Although these sites have been temporarily patched up, more permanent&#13;
works are requiredto restore the sites basedon appropriate design standards that achieve the required&#13;
levels o f service and economic life o f the network. This may include better design detailing at some&#13;
sites, including the incorporation o f outlet headwalls at drainage culverts (where not previously&#13;
providedfor), to mitigate wave-induced washout o friprap during future storm events.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Minor Bridge Replacement (Task B2):                  Two coastal river-crossing fords caused&#13;
communications to be cut during Cyclone Heta and under other emergency conditions, namely at&#13;
Malaemalu and Vaoai on the south-coast road in Upolu. Vehicles were washed downstream, and&#13;
previously there have been fatalities at both locations under flooding conditions. Low-cost forms of&#13;
crossings structures such as large culverts or small bridges are appropriate at these locations, having&#13;
much larger flow capacity, higher profiles, and improvedmanagement o f debris. For similar reasons,&#13;
and also because o f inadequate low flow capacity and accretion o f sand inthe outlet channels, similar&#13;
treatments are also proposed at three river crossings in Savai'i, namely Lano Nos. 1and 2 and Safai.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Implementation Support&#13;
&#13;
27.     Technical Advisory Services (Task Cl): This task involves the provision o f assistance which&#13;
supports implementation o f the project to achieve the defined development objectives within the&#13;
specified resources. The following assistance will be required, which will be provided through&#13;
companies and individuals as appropriate:.&#13;
&#13;
      (i)   EngineeringDesign and Supervision Services: This will involve the appointment of a&#13;
            firm able to undertake all aspects ofthe engineering design andsupervision, including&#13;
            investigation, environmental assessments, documentation and construction&#13;
            supervision relatingto: (i)   eligible coastal structural rehabilitation, reconstruction and&#13;
            non-structural rehabilitation works; (ii)    structural rehabilitation assessment and design&#13;
            relatingto the Aleipata MPA Regional Centre; (iii)       preparation and construction&#13;
            supervisionof road and drainage rehabilitationworks; and (iv) design, documentation&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 18 -&#13;
&#13;
            and construction supervision o f small bridge replacements. The firm engaged for this&#13;
            role will needto have demonstrated a capability across abroad range o f disciplines,&#13;
            and a commitment to planningfor andimplementingthe works within tight&#13;
            timefkames to fixed budgets.&#13;
&#13;
     (ii)Manazement         of Grant-BasedActivities: Itis proposedthat a full-time Manager be&#13;
            appointed to administer the Small Grants Scheme. The Manager will be a nominated&#13;
            subcontractor to the firm appointed under (i)  above, but will report to MNRE. The&#13;
            manager will coordinate activities to promote public awareness o f the scheme, solicit&#13;
            project proposals from eligible parties, coordinate their evaluation with technical&#13;
            support from others inMNRE,prepare evaluation reports andtechnical&#13;
            recommendationsto a committee for approval, and undertake monitoring and&#13;
            reporting on progress inproject implementation. The Manager will have a highlevel&#13;
            o f interaction with village communities, will need to be fluent inthe Samoan&#13;
            language, and have a good understanding o fFa 'aMatai, Fa 'a Samoa and Samoan&#13;
            community consultation processes.&#13;
&#13;
      (iii)TechnicalAdviceonEco-SystemsRecovery: Itisproposedthatafull-timeCoastal&#13;
            Resilience Adviser be appointed to support implementation o f the eco-system&#13;
            recovery initiative. The Advisor will be a nominated subcontractor to the firm&#13;
            appointed under (i) but will report to MNRE. The Advisor is expected to have&#13;
                                  above,&#13;
            a background inmarine or earth science. Specialist marine survey contractors will be&#13;
            engaged to undertake site-specific studies, andprepare recovery plans, andpossibly&#13;
            assist intheir implementation. The Advisor will plan, design and supervise these&#13;
            activities. It is also expected that the Advisor will assist inthe technical review o f&#13;
            project proposals considered for funding under the Small Grant Scheme. As for the&#13;
            position under (ii), Advisor will have a highlevel o f interaction with village&#13;
                                 the&#13;
            communities, will need to be fluent inthe Samoan language, andhave a good&#13;
            understandingo fFa 'aMatai, Fa 'a Samoa and Samoan community consultation&#13;
            processes.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Project Management (Task C2): Due to the limited duration o f the project, and to avoid&#13;
unnecessary overheads, it i s proposed that project management and project auditing arrangementsbe&#13;
implementedas an extension of the existing arrangements under IAMP under contract to the MOF.&#13;
Procedures, manuals and resources, required for the efficient administration o f the CERP, will, as far&#13;
as practicable, be basedon the systems that will operateunder IAMP.&#13;
&#13;
29.     Incremental Operating Expenses (Task C3): This covers incremental operating costs incurred&#13;
inimplementingtheproject.&#13;

&#13;
FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
1.      The Financial Management System proposed for this project i s the same as that adopted&#13;
for the Second Infrastructure Asset Management Project (IAMP) which was approvedby IDA on&#13;
December 29, 2003 (Cr. 3848-WSO).         The desk review for that system was carried out by a&#13;
qualified accredited Financial Management Specialist in accordance with the details provided in&#13;
the Guidelines to Staff on June 30, 2001, "Assessment of Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
in World Bank Financial Projects," Guidelines for FM Assessment, Financial Monitoring&#13;
Reports: Guidelines to Staff, and Assessment o fFinancialManagement Arrangements inWorld-&#13;
Bank Financed Projects. The objective o fthe reviewwas to determine whether the Project had&#13;
inplace an adequate financial management system as requiredbythe World Bank under OP/BP&#13;
10.02.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The assessment concluded that the project will meet minimum Bank financial&#13;
management requirements subject to the implementation o f the following agreements under&#13;
IAMP:     (i)upgradingthe existing accounting system and software andstaff capacity, (ii)&#13;
updatingthe project financial management manual as part of the Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(PIP) and providing trainings to project staff, and (iii)strengthening internal controls and&#13;
accounting procedures through designing, reporting and monitoring features to track and verify&#13;
the use o f the project proceeds and flow o f funds. While compliance with these requirements has&#13;
not yet been certified, compliance i s required precedent to Grant and Credit effectiveness&#13;
scheduled for not later than July 31,2004.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
3.      The proposed project will be managed through supplemental services to the P M U o f the&#13;
I M P , which is a small private sector team under contract to the MOF, and fall under the&#13;
direction o f the existing IPSC. The PMU i s the same central agency responsible for the first&#13;
IAMP project (Cr. 3193-WS). The PMU will be responsible for overall project financial&#13;
management activities including planning and budgeting, preparing consolidated financial&#13;
statements and progress reports o f the project and ensuring a smooth flow o f funds to their&#13;
respective project activities. It will manage the project's Special Account (SA) and maintain the&#13;
local currency account and ensure their timely replenishment including preparation o f statements&#13;
of expenditure and reimbursement claims.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The existing PMU is headed by the Project Manager (engineer), Accountant, and&#13;
Administrative Assistant.     The supplemental PMU services will comprise a CERP Project&#13;
Manager (serving continuously but not fulltime) and an Assistant Accountant dedicated to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

CERP. The proposed organization structure o f the supplemented PMU was reviewed and was&#13;
considered to be appropriate for the needs o fthe project. The organization chart will be similar to&#13;
IAMP, which is illustratedbelow.&#13;

&#13;
5.      The PMUhas an established computerizedaccounting system. Its major strengths are: (i)&#13;
good cash accounting system. Accounting books are maintained on double-entry system and are&#13;
up-to-date; (ii) have been trained to carry out basic accounting functions; (iii)reasonable&#13;
                staff                                                                  a&#13;
system of internal controls is in place. An accounting Manual has been developed, and this&#13;
documents the various accounting systems and procedures; and (iv) there is a good system o f&#13;
transaction audit by a private audit firm.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Underthe proposed upgraded computerized accounting and reporting system for IAMP-&#13;
2, which will be used also by the CERP, the accounting controls at all levels will be adequate.&#13;
There will be proper verification and documentation procedures. Journal and Payment vouchers&#13;
will be adequately prepared and checked. The SA will be reconciled with the bank statements.&#13;
The filing system will facilitate for subsequent audit andthere will be clear segregation o fduties.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Information System. The existing computerized accounting system has limited capacity.&#13;
It can only produce basic books and standard reports such as trial balance, general ledger,&#13;
balance sheet and income statements.&#13;
&#13;
8.      The IAMP FMS review found that the existingaccounting software andthe Management&#13;
Information system had limitations. The specification and features o f the IAMP upgraded&#13;
software has been reviewed and is acceptable to the Bank. The software shall be installed and&#13;
test run before effectiveness. The minimum specifications and features of the upgraded FMS&#13;
software are indicatedbelow:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Multi-level reporting byproject, sub-project or any component level&#13;
    0   Multi-currency support&#13;

&#13;
         Ability to tracldlink to physicalperfonnance indicators&#13;
         Capability to track andreport onprocurement/contract basis&#13;
         Ability to track and report expenses on expenditure category level, field level, screen&#13;
         level and sub-project level&#13;
         Ability to track and report using flexible reporting cycles: monthly, quarterly, yearly or&#13;
         any user-definedperiod&#13;
         Ability to track basedon Actual, Budget, Forecast, andLife o fthe Project&#13;
         Multiple location and consolidation facility&#13;
         Multi-level help at screen and field levels, as well as on-line documentation&#13;
         Drill-down feature to take the user to the origin o f the transaction from the Query screen.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing and Training&#13;
&#13;
9.       The PMU staff is experienced with IDA Guidelines and policies on disbursement and&#13;
financial management.        Staff are highly qualified in business administration, accounting,&#13;
engineering and information technology background. They are proficient in the use o f EXCEL&#13;
and WORD software.          They have knowledge and experience in accounting and financial&#13;
management and are familiar with the Bank's financial reporting requirements. The proposed&#13;
staffing level is deemed to be adequate, the roles and job descriptions for each position is&#13;
specified anddocumented.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Training on generating reports under the upgraded computerized accounting system is&#13;
being provided under IAMP and will be extended for CERP. The organization structure, job&#13;
title, responsibilities, educational background and professional experiences will be documented&#13;
inthe CERP supplement to the IAMPFinancial Management Manual(FMM).&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
11.      Overall, the financial management and computerized accounting system o f the proposed&#13;
Project i s satisfactory. The computerized accounting system has been inoperation since the start&#13;
of IAMP in 1999, andwill be upgraded (para. 8). The PMUprepares and submits regular project&#13;
management reports inaccordance with Article IV, Sections 4.01 and 4.02 o fthe DCA.&#13;
&#13;
12.      For the proposedproject, the PMUMOF would prepare counterpart fund arrangements in&#13;
advancewithin the schedule o f the government budget cycle, and include those expenditures that&#13;
mustbereflected inthe annual budgetproposals.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Financial Management Manual. The IAMP Phase 2 Project FMMwill be used for the&#13;
proposed project. It will be consistent with the upgraded accounting software, and will be used&#13;
as a guide for staff and training. It describes the flow o f funds, authorities and delegation o f&#13;
responsibilities o f the project staff, disbursement procedures, internal controls, financial and&#13;
accounting policies and procedures, and transaction flows as well as budget preparation&#13;
procedures.&#13;

&#13;
InternalControls&#13;
&#13;
14.     The PMUhas experience inmobilizing project funds based on IAMP and informulating&#13;
reports on uses o f funds to reimburse claims from the Bank. However, the control procedures&#13;
and documentation reconciliation for tracking down payments made by the MOF were deemed&#13;
to be inadequate.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Inaddressing those previous deficiencies, the MOF proposed a different funds flow and&#13;
payment arrangement structure within finance division to ensure verification and reconciliation&#13;
accounts and supporting documents are obtained by the PMU in a timely fashion. The&#13;
accounting system and documentation has been redesigned in order to control and keep track o f&#13;
the flow o f project funds where the project will operate. The necessary and simple reporting and&#13;
monitoring features will be built into its system to track the use o f project proceeds. Such&#13;
procedures will bereflected inthe Project FMM.&#13;
&#13;
16.     The payments to third parties will be initiated by the PMU based on approved contracts,&#13;
under the followingdetailedprocedures:&#13;
&#13;
               PMU Project Manager           will approve     the invoice    submitted by the&#13;
               consultant/supplier;&#13;
&#13;
               PMU staff prepares payment voucher based on approved invoice; records in the&#13;
               accounting system; and submits to MOF. A copy o f voucher i s retained at the&#13;
               PMUfor follow-up;&#13;
&#13;
               Treasury's Finance Division verifies payment voucher/invoice and passes to&#13;
               Accounting Division (if paid out o f Government Advance Fund account, or&#13;
               Finance Division verifies payment voucher (with supporting vouchers) and&#13;
               submit with authorization letter to the Central Bank o f Samoa (CBS) for&#13;
               processing o f telegraphic transfer from the SA. A copy o f remittance instruction&#13;
               is sent to the PMU, with dischargedvouchers.&#13;
&#13;
               PMU receives all cheques from the MOF and obtains SA statements from the&#13;
               FinanceDivision; and&#13;
&#13;
               For a direct payment, the PMU prepares the withdrawal application, submits to&#13;
               MOF for verification, certification and signature before transmitting to IDA for&#13;
               payment (with supporting voucher/approved invoice/contract).&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
&#13;
17.     A SA would be maintained at the CBS and would be operated by the PMU under the&#13;
report-based disbursement method.            The authorized allocation of the SA would be&#13;
US$450,000 which represents about three months o f estimated disbursements from the Credit.&#13;
Under the report-based disbursement method, a forecast o f project expenditures is agreed upon&#13;
between the P M U and IDA, covering the current and next FMR reporting period. Thereafter,&#13;
aggregate disbursement requests not exceeding this forecast amount are transferred by IDA into&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            -27 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the SA upon demand by the PMU. The SA would be operated in accordance with the IDA'S&#13;
operational policies.    The Project Manager, with the assistance o f the Accountant, will be&#13;
responsible for administration o f the SA and all Credit disbursements related transactions for the&#13;
project. Only two signatures are required on any withdrawal application-that o f the Project&#13;
Manager and one official from the MOF. The general principles that other accounts should not&#13;
be combined with the World Bank fhds inthe SA have been notified to the Recipient.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Special Account. At central level, the M O F will open one SA denominated inU S Dollar&#13;
currency for receiving funds from IDA, and will set up a separate Project Account for the&#13;
counterpart funding (identified as GPA 99 account, an internal code used by the borrower) for&#13;
CERP, which will be treated as a Bank Account, instead of opening another account for the&#13;
project in a commercial bank. Any payments will be charged to individual "child accounts" for&#13;
each project component identified under the parent GPA 900 coded account with a separate GPA&#13;
sub-account for the counterpart contribution from which taxes will be paidout.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The GPA account will have an opening balance from the counterpart contribution to&#13;
CERP under implementing agencies' budgets and funds transferred from the SA (held with&#13;
CBS), based on a forecast o f disbursements provided by the PMU. It was agreed upon that the&#13;
project will adopt the transaction-based disbursement, until the request from the Government to&#13;
move to report-based disbursement is received.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Withdrawal Applications (WAS). The current arrangement under IAMPwill continue and&#13;
will be adapted for CERP, as illustrated herein. (i)For replenishment o f SA, a withdrawal&#13;
application will be prepared monthly by the PMU (with supporting documents) and submittedto&#13;
Treasury-Finance Division for verification, certification and signature before transmitting to&#13;
IDA; and (ii) for reimbursement will be prepared by the PMU on a quarterly basis (with&#13;
                WA&#13;
supporting documents such as SOE statements or FMRs) and sent to Treasury for verification,&#13;
certification and signature prior to transmitting to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Disbursement Arrangement. The type o f disbursement system to be adopted for this&#13;
project i s report-based with the submissiono f quarterly financial monitoring reports to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
22.     Uses of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) and Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).&#13;
Under a transaction-based disbursement method, disbursements would be made against WASfor&#13;
replenishments to the SA and reimbursements supported by full documentation, i.e., invoices;&#13;
and/or SOEs, and against direct payments supported by full documentation. IDA would disburse&#13;
against SOEs for the following types o f expenditures: (i) contracts for civil works costing less&#13;
                                                            on&#13;
than US$600,000 equivalent: (ii)     on contracts for goods costing less than US$50,000; (iii)   on&#13;
contracts for consultants services costing less than US$50,000; (iv) training; and (v) PMU&#13;
operating costs. Under a report-based disbursement method, disbursements would be made&#13;
against WAS supported by FMRs which include information on financial, procurement and&#13;
physical progress, source o f supply, breakdown o f aggregate disbursements by legal&#13;
disbursement category and percentage, SA reconciliation and bank statements, and forecast o f&#13;
expendituresfor the next two FMRreporting periods.&#13;

&#13;
24.     A sample format o f FMRs was provided for firther modification to comply with the&#13;
project cost structure. These reports will also be required to be submitted to the Bank on a&#13;
quarterlybasis within 30 days after the end o f each quarter. The format o f the reports and output&#13;
monitoring indicators have been agreed during appraisal and set o f FMR report shall comprises&#13;

25.     Project Reporting Requirements, Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements. Reports will&#13;
include: (i)  quarterly FMRs; (ii)   bi-annual IDA supervision mission aide memoires; and (iii)&#13;
implementation completion report prepared jointly by IDA and the Government within six&#13;
months before the project's closing date.&#13;
&#13;
26.     IDA will conduct bi-annual supervision missions with MOF on the basis o f a report&#13;
prepared by the PMU, and this includes: (i)    an assessment o f progress in the implementation o f&#13;
key actions and performance indicators (see under paragraph on Financial Management Action&#13;
Plan); (ii)verification o f the continued validity o f the design assumptions in light o f&#13;
implementation experience and the evolving environment; and (iii)        identification o f remedial&#13;
actions that might prove necessary to achieve the objectives of the Project. Bank supervision&#13;
missions including financial management will be conducted twice a year. Quarterly FMRs&#13;
including annual audit reports will be submitted to IDA for review and comments. There will be&#13;
no mid-termreview because o f the short implementationperiod.&#13;
&#13;
27.     The BorrowerPMU shall submit an audit o f its project accounts within six months after&#13;
the end o f each fiscal year; and (ii)The BorrowerPMU shall fimish quarterly financial&#13;
management reports to IDA within 30 days after each quarter.&#13;
&#13;
RiskAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
28.     There is a risk that the counterpart funds will not be available during project&#13;
implementation.      In the earlier project, this was mitigated by ensuring the PMU budget&#13;
requirements are included in the budget requirements o f the MOF. The same practice will be&#13;
adopted for CERP, which was confirmed duringnegotiations.&#13;
&#13;
29.     There is lack o f capacity withinthe country interms o f competent accountants. There is&#13;
a risk that the staff turnover inthe PMUwould result innon-submission o f financial reports and&#13;
weak accounting system management. To mitigate this risk, the PMU would ensure that the&#13;
accountant is backed-up by support from the system-developer and their in-house accountant.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 30 -&#13;
&#13;
Audit&#13;
&#13;
30.     Internal Audit. The internal audit set-up and evaluation functions are currently exercised&#13;
by the MOF, with its audit bureau staff responsible for internal audit functions and physical&#13;
inspection including checking and verifying accounting documents andBank reconciliation.&#13;
&#13;
31.     External Audit. Similar to the existing arrangement under IAMP, a combined audit o f the&#13;
project financial statements, the SA and the FMRs or SOEs will be conducted annually by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. In order to ensure that the audit fee shall be&#13;
adequate for an acceptable quality o f audit, the project audit cost will be treated as an eligible&#13;
project cost. The selection o f auditing firm will be based on a least cost selection, following the&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines. The Terms o f Reference (TOR) is valid and consistent with the&#13;
Bank's requirements. Each annual audit report shall be submitted to the Bank within six months&#13;
o f the endo f the fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
32.     Supervision Plans.       The Bank`s Financial Management Specialist will join the&#13;
supervision team at least once a year to ensure the financial safeguards are in place. The&#13;
quarterly FMRs and annual audit reports will be reviewed and comments will be provided to the&#13;
PMU/MOF.&#13;

General&#13;
&#13;
1.      Procurement o f works and goods will follow the Guidelines-Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits dated January 1995, revised in January and August 1996, September&#13;
1997 and January 1999 (the Guidelines).           IDA'S Standard Bidding Documents (including&#13;
standard prequalification and bid evaluation documents) will be used for all IDA financed&#13;
procurement carried out by International Competitive Bidding (ICB).         Biddingprocedures for&#13;
contracts procured under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will use local procedures and&#13;
bidding documents, as modified to ensure economy, efficiency, transparency, and consistency&#13;
with SectionIofthe Guidelines. The main modifications needed are inthe areas o f participation&#13;
in bidding, advertising and time for bid preparation, use of Standard Bidding Documents,&#13;
classification o f contractors, qualification and post-qualification, registration, bid opening and&#13;
evaluation, rejection o f bids, post-bidding negotiations and inspection and auditing o f accounts,&#13;
all o f which are covered in an Annex to the DCA. Procurement o f consulting services will&#13;
conform to the Guidelines - Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers dated January 1997, revised in September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002. A&#13;
Procurement Plan, providing a timeline for each step in the procurement process is included in&#13;
the Project Implementation Plan(BPIP), andwill be updated quarterly.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementAssessmentof ImplementingAgencies&#13;
&#13;
2.      An Assessment of Agency's Capacity to Implement Project Procurement was carried out&#13;
in2003 inrespect of the three agencies involved inthis project, namely, the MOF, the MWTI,&#13;
andthe MNRE.All these agencies have previous experience indonor-financed procurement, and&#13;
ongoing training is being provided under the IAMP. The conclusion o f the assessment was that&#13;
the overall procurement risk was Average and the mitigation measures under IAMP-2 are aimed&#13;
at controlling and lowering the risk.&#13;
&#13;
Procurementmethods(Table A)&#13;
&#13;
 3.     The project costs by procurement arrangement are shown inTable A. Works for coastal&#13;
resilience with an estimated contract value o f US$1 m equivalent and over for a total cost of&#13;
$3.31 m will be procured by modified ICB in two packages. Works for road rehabilitation and&#13;
bridge replacement, for a total cost o f $0.98 m, will be procured by N C B in three packages.&#13;
Minor works for restoration o f drainage structures, for a total cost of US$0.40 m, will be&#13;
procured through direct contracting with existing maintenance contractors (most of which were&#13;
competitively selected) to be implemented under existing contract conditions. ICB will be used&#13;
for 71 percent o f the value o fworks procured under the project.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
4.     No goods will be procured directly under the Project.            Small quantities o f goods,&#13;
estimated at less than 1 percent o f component value, may be procured under the small grants&#13;
component, and within the Implementation Support services for the purposes o f implementing&#13;
the contract activities.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Consultants will be selected usingIDA Standard Request for Proposals (RFP) - Selection&#13;
o f Consultants dated July 1997, revised April 1998, July 1999 and March 2002 for one contract&#13;
estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent and over with a total cost o f $0.99 m. Contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent with a total cost of $0.20 m will be procured&#13;
using local RFP documents, which are based on IDA'SStandard Request for Proposals. Firms&#13;
will be appointed using Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) for most contracts having a&#13;
total cost of $1.19 mywith an option for using Least Cost Selection (LCS) or Consultants'&#13;
Qualifications (CQ) for small contracts o f less than $100,000, as shown in Table Al. One&#13;
consulting assignment with a contract value estimated to cost more than US$200,000 equivalent&#13;
will be advertised in UN Development Business. All assignments will be advertised in two&#13;
national newspapers.&#13;
&#13;
6.     Miscellaneous. Some small activities to the value o f US$120,000 will be carried out&#13;
through Grants to local communities or NGOs, disbursed and monitored in accordance with&#13;
procedures outlined in an Operational Manual, approval o f which i s required as a condition o f&#13;
credit effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Prequalification&#13;
&#13;
7.      Contractors for ICB works, with a total cost o f $3.31 mywill be post-qualified in&#13;
accordance with the biddingdocuments. Contractors.for N C B works are registered according to&#13;
class with MWTI, but foreign contractors who wish to bid are permitted to do so and will be&#13;
post-qualified. The conditions o f acceptability o f the registration procedures are indicated in an&#13;
Annex to the legal agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Prior review thresholds(TableB)&#13;
&#13;
8.     The thresholds for procurement by ICB, NCB, and Other methods are shown inTable B.&#13;
The thresholds for prior review are US$600,000 for Works plus the first contract under each&#13;
sub-component valued at under US$600,000, US$50,000 for Goods, and US$lOO,OOO for&#13;
consultant services contracts with firms and US$50,000 for consultant services contracts with&#13;
individuals. Prior review would apply to 82 percent o f the total value o f works, goods and&#13;
consultant services procured under the project. Ex-post review would cover 50 percent of&#13;
contracts not subject to prior review.&#13;

&#13;
                       ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     This Environmental Policy Framework establishes rules and procedures to be followed&#13;
under the Cyclone Emergency Recovery Project (the Project) with regard to environmental&#13;
assessment, monitoring and mitigation of potential negative impacts. The Framework is based&#13;
on that approved for the Infrastructure Asset Management Program (IAMP) inNovember 2003.&#13;
GoS environmental legislation and draft regulations satisfy the requirements o f World Bank&#13;
Operational Policy (OP 4.01). Environmental assessment o f project components shall be&#13;
undertakeninaccordance with the procedures set out inthe draft EIA Regulations 1998.&#13;
&#13;
EnvironmentalAssessment&#13;
&#13;
2.     Sub-projects will be screened into one o f three categories for the purposes o f&#13;
environmental assessment, each requiring a different level o f investigation, reporting and&#13;
independent review reflecting the significance o f the potential impacts, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
       For projects that have no, or low but acceptable environmental impacts, the Director&#13;
       MNRE may issue a waiver to the proponent from the further requirements of the EL4&#13;
       Regulations. In issuing a waiver, the Director MNRE will rely on the advice o f the&#13;
       Assistant Director, PUMA. Such works are to be covered by Codes o f Environmental&#13;
       Practice (COEP) provisions.&#13;
&#13;
    a  For other projects, in order to determine whether an EIA i s necessary, a systematic&#13;
       procedure will be followed, as indicated inthe GoS Treasury Manual on Project Planning&#13;
       and Programming.      This commences with a Preliminary Environmental Assessment&#13;
       Report (PEAR) that i s prepared by the proponent. The project may proceed if, after&#13;
       review, the Director PUMA concludes there will be no significant adverse environmental&#13;
       impacts.&#13;
&#13;
       Projects for which there are potential significant adverse environmental impacts will be&#13;
       subject to a full EIA process.     The EIA, prepared by the proponent, must consider&#13;
       alternatives and mitigation measures.       The EIA is reviewed by PUMA. Affected&#13;
       communities must be consulted and there may be formal public meetings. PUMA may&#13;
       request hrther information and, if approving the works to proceed, may set special&#13;
       conditions that must be met by the proponent.&#13;
&#13;
3.     A screening checklist has been developed under IAMP as part of the institutional&#13;
strengthening and reform component which includes both physical and social impact&#13;
components.    The use o f this screening checklist has been adopted by PUMA and would&#13;
continue both for the Project and for broader implementation o f the EL4 assessment system&#13;
underthe new environmental legislation.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
StandardOperatingProcedures: Codes of EnvironmentalPractice(COEPs)&#13;
&#13;
4.      Under IAMP a set o f operating procedures for routine smaller projects with minimal&#13;
environmental impacts was implemented through the introduction o f a set o f Codes o f&#13;
Environmental Practice (COEPs). These guide and control the ways in which environmental&#13;
aspects o f all civil engineering works and the private sector are managed and addressed. The&#13;
Interim COEPs for Samoa were published in 2001, and formally adopted by the Public Works&#13;
Department (now MWTI) and Department o f Lands, Surveys and Environment (now MNRE),&#13;
as standard operating procedures for civil works, in compliance with the draft environmental&#13;
legislation. The COEPs shall be applied in all civil works contracts financed under the Project.&#13;
The COEPs shall also be incorporated in the standard procedures o f MWTI through assistance&#13;
under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Under the IAMP the Government will establish a contractor qualification system, to&#13;
include a provision to purchase the COEP's manual and undergo training workshop(s) on the&#13;
system in order to qualify for all Government Contracts. Furthermore it i s proposed that the&#13;
linkage to the PUMA compliance monitoring system be more fully developed and the&#13;
introduction o f penalty provisions for contractors be scheduled over the course o f the Project in&#13;
order to encourage compliance.&#13;
&#13;
ComplianceMonitoring&#13;
&#13;
6.      Monitoring o f compliance should be done by staff in MNRE. Responsibilities will&#13;
include the following:&#13;
&#13;
        carry out principal liaison with PUMA on all environmental and social issues arising&#13;
        from the project and support to the extent possible non-project activities by MWTI.&#13;
&#13;
        fully implement the Deed Of Agreement Waiver Provisions, August 2001 between the&#13;
        former DLSE and PWD and update to reflect new government reform structure.&#13;
&#13;
        responsibility for preparation o f initial screening reports for all sub-projects&#13;
&#13;
        responsibility for reporting the recommendations from PUMA&#13;
&#13;
        responsibility for ensuring that all recommendations are provided within the scope o f&#13;
        services o fthe design and supervision consultants&#13;
&#13;
        responsibility for review o f draft environmental management plans prepared by design&#13;
        consultants in order to ensure they are realistic and able to be implemented by&#13;
        supervision consultants and contractors.&#13;
&#13;
        to carry out compliance monitoring for all sub -projects to an agreed schedule and in&#13;
        cases where event monitoring i s necessary due to either complaint or unusual event.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 36 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   responsibility for the final editing and completion o f the COEP's manual and for on-&#13;
         goinginvolvement inupdating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   responsibility for organization o f annual workshops on the implementation o f COEP's&#13;
         and compliance monitoring o f EnvironmentalManagement Plans (EMP)&#13;
&#13;
    0   to prepare appropriate sections for inclusion in an overall quality management and&#13;
        registration system for all contractors&#13;
&#13;
EnvironmentalManagementPlans&#13;
&#13;
7.       When the scope o f the project cannot be handled by implementation of a COEP a sub-&#13;
project with some adverse environmental impacts (i.e. a Category B project) shall be the subject&#13;
o f an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which can stand on its own or be an integral part&#13;
of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP).&#13;
&#13;
8.      The EMP shall not be confined to on-site effects, but will include the effect o f off-site&#13;
activities, e.g. trucking routes, sediment outwash, traffic diversion and spoil dumps. The exact&#13;
nature o f the mitigation measures will depend on the location o f the site relative to potentially&#13;
sensitive settings (e.g., coastal fringes, farming corridors, communities).     The EMP will be&#13;
developed by the proponent, then ratified by PUMA. It will then be agreed to by the Project&#13;
Manager andthe site contractor(s).&#13;
&#13;
9.      PUMA will also make provision in the EMP so it can inspect project sites at any time&#13;
(during or outside work hours) to look at work practices and the implementation of assigned&#13;
mitigation measures or approved conditions for the project. Where it is observed that such&#13;
measures have not been implemented, then the officer concerned will, inserious cases, report the&#13;
nature and location o f the alleged breach directly to the Assistant Director, PUMA. The Assistant&#13;
Director, P U M A shall then make direct contact with whoever has responsibility for the&#13;
implementation o f the EMP at the project site and make arrangements for corrective measures.&#13;
Inminor indiscretions, the site project manager is to be advised directly.&#13;
&#13;
10.      An EMP shall be prepared for each o f the project's sub-components or groups o f sub-&#13;
components (e.g., bridge replacement works, or road widening). Where the individualprojects&#13;
are not large scale and will not have potentially significant environmental effects, standard type&#13;
documentation can make up a significant proportion o f the EMP that should also be&#13;
supplemented by information to reflect conditions at the particular sites. The EMP document&#13;
should be as succinct as possible, yet sufficiently detailed to provide clear directions to project&#13;
designers and construction contractors.&#13;
&#13;
11.     A compliance monitoring system shall integrate the provisions o f each EMP with&#13;
performance on the implementation of COEP's as the success o f the system is dependent on the&#13;
implementation of both.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           - 37 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
InstitutionalArrangements&#13;
&#13;
12.     The draft EIA regulations clearly set out the steps and responsibilities for each stage o f&#13;
the environmental assessment process. For each sub-project, proponents such as MWTIor S A A&#13;
shall be responsible for liaison with and advising PUMA, preparing all environmental&#13;
assessment submission documents, developing mitigation measures and alternatives, ensuring&#13;
affected communities are consulted and kept informed. The proponents shall also be responsible&#13;
for implementing the sub-projects within the scope approved under the environmental&#13;
assessment, implementing the works within the provisions o f the COEP, and meeting any&#13;
specific conditions o f EA approval.&#13;
&#13;
13.     PUMA shall be responsible for independent review o f application for an environmental&#13;
assessment, giving the appropriate approval or not, as the case may be, or referring the&#13;
application to a higher stage inthe EL4process. PUMA will generally be required to respond to&#13;
applications within a time frame specified inthe draft Regulations.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Whilst the responsibility to carry out environmental assessments and develop mitigation&#13;
measures lies with the proponents o f each sub-project, in many instances this responsibility&#13;
during IAMP Phase 1 was exercised through local and intemational consultants. Proponent's&#13;
staff, particularly those o f MWTI, shall be familiar and competent in managing consultancy&#13;
contracts for which the TOR includes provision for preparing documentation for, and obtaining,&#13;
environmental assessment approvals. MWTI staff are to be familiar with the requirements and&#13;
applications o f the COEP, and develop a working understanding o f the implications o f&#13;
environmental issues on projects, especially during the inception phase o f the sub-project cycle&#13;
before engineering consultants are appointed. Within the MWTI, the key responsibilities are to&#13;
bewith:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   The CEO MWTIfor policy development and implementation, and ilistitutional leadership&#13;
        on environmental matters within the Department;&#13;
&#13;
        The Director, Asset Management - Roads, Infrastructure and Seawalls and the Principal&#13;
        Asset Engineer, MWTI for developing and incorporating environmental management and&#13;
        best practice (including the COEP) into engineering design, contract documentation and&#13;
        supervisions, and monitoring;    The Principal Architect, MWTI has a similar role in&#13;
        respect o fbuildingworks and architectural developments;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   The Principal Contracts Engineer, MWTI works closely with the Principal Asset&#13;
        Engineer, MWTI for the application o f environmental controls (including the COEP) into&#13;
        the construction and maintenance works operations and liaison with PUMA on&#13;
        compliance monitoring and enforcement issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  The Component Manager for the Project, works closely with the Principal Asset Manager&#13;
        and the Principal Contracts Engineer, MWTI for the application o f environmental&#13;
       controls (including the COEP) into all aspects o f design and supervision o f sub-project&#13;
       contracts andthe application o f the draft EL4regulations to all aspects o f the construction&#13;
       and maintenance works operations. This position i s a key supervisory role to ensure that&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 3 8 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       the design inception report includes evidence of initial consultation between the sub-&#13;
       project on behalfo f MWTIandPUMA concerning initial screening requirements.&#13;
&#13;
15.    The role o f PUMA is also critical to ensure that a recommendation on the results o f the&#13;
screening process i s sent to the IAMP Component Manager and the Principal Asset Engineerina&#13;
timely fashion so that adequate time i s allowed to include the screening recommendation within&#13;
the final design inceptionreport. This recommendationmay leadto the needfor avariation inthe&#13;
scope o f work included in the contract for design services. There was some evidence found&#13;
during the review o f performance under IAMP Phase 1that there was an inordinate amount of&#13;
time elapsing between the submission o f environmental documentation and a recommendation&#13;
from PUMA. PUMA shall work to improve perfonnance inthis regard.&#13;
&#13;
16.    Under IAMP-1, the PWD (now MWTI) carried out most design and environmental&#13;
management activities for sub-projects through engineering consultants.       With the reform of&#13;
Ministry o f Works in October 2002, all services, including EIA, are to be undertaken by&#13;
consultants, under specifications and supervisionby MWTImanagingengineers. Within the new&#13;
MWTIstructure there is provision for both an environmental planner andinfrastructure planner.&#13;
The initial liaison between the MWTI on behalf o f the project and PUMA in relation to sub-&#13;
project screening should ideally be carried out by one o f these officers. At the moment, both o f&#13;
these positions do not appear to be functioning. Fillingthem is a priority.&#13;
&#13;
Consultation&#13;
&#13;
17.    The draft EIA Regulations require proponents to consult andkeep informed local&#13;
communities affectedby the sub-projects. The draft EIA Regulations emphasize early&#13;
communication betweenthe proponent andMNREto ensure procedures are streamlined. The&#13;
Regulations alsorequire MNREto prepare andpublishguidelines on EIAprocedures to&#13;
proponents. Because the draft EIA Regulations are not yet enacted by Cabinet, a number of&#13;
features inthem cannot realistically be adopted (e.g. Ministerial approvals, functions of the&#13;
Environment Board, and application o fpenalties). For the purposes of the Project, suitable&#13;
altemative delegations for these aspects have been adopted that keep the actions within the&#13;
MNRE.The new environmentallaws the PlanningandUrbanManagementBilldoes not&#13;
contemplate the adoption o f any regulations to support the new law so the previous interim&#13;
Regulationswill continue to apply.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
18.    Monitoringunder the Project shall be strengthened insupport o f environmental&#13;
management, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    0  Monitoring on sub-projects to ensure that the scope o f works does not differ from the&#13;
       scope that was approved under the draft EIA Regulations, compliance with any COEP&#13;
       provisions or conditions of EIA approval. In some instances appropriate baseline&#13;
       environmental information will need to be gathered and submitted with the EIA. Such&#13;
       preparatory monitoring shall be identified inthe implementation plan for the sub-project.&#13;
       This will permit the evaluation o f impacts over time compared with baseline data. At&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           - 39 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       present there are no specific provisions in the Interim Regulations. Although not literally&#13;
       provided in the EIA Guidelines, provision shall be made for the explicit monitoring o f&#13;
       impacts. The proponent is also required to carry out monitoring o f impacts through data&#13;
       collection andthe provision of it to PUMA for its evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Critical areas such as the coastal hazard zone shall be monitored to identify the long-term&#13;
       trends o f natural processes and so quantify changes in the baseline conditions. As the&#13;
       inventory o f coastal hazard zones has been completed, monitoring should be facilitated&#13;
       due to the presence o f detailed baseline information in mapped output with indicators o f&#13;
       sensitivity.&#13;

              LANDACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
1.      This Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework              (LARF or the Framework)&#13;
establishes parameters for the conduct o f land acquisition and resettlement o f Displaced Persons&#13;
(DPs) who may be affected during implementation o f sub-projects o f the Cyclone Emergency&#13;
Recovery Project (CERP or the Project). While the number o f people and magnitude o f adverse&#13;
impacts are expected to be minimal, the Project will work to further minimize the number of DPs&#13;
and/or adverse impacts o fthe sub-projects.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The objective o f the Project i s to assist the Independent State of Samoa (Samoa) in&#13;
recovering the resilience o f the natural and built environments damaged by Cyclone Heta to a&#13;
sustainable level so that the vulnerability o f the people and economy to prevailing natural&#13;
hazards i s reduced.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Project consists o f the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof as&#13;
Samoa and the International Development Association (the Association) may agree upon from&#13;
time to time to achieve such objectives: (a) Coastal Resilience Recovery; (b) Road Infrastructure&#13;
Rehabilitation; and (c) Implementation Support.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Project components which may require land acquisition andresettlement include:&#13;
&#13;
   (a) Reconstruction or upgrading o f various shoreline protection structures amounting to&#13;
        about 10kmintotal length; and&#13;
&#13;
   (b) replacement or upgrading o f about five (5) river crossings on primary roads;&#13;
&#13;
5.      The Framework is based on the World Bank's Operational Policy 4.12 on Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement, which i s based on the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
   0    Avoid or minimise involuntary resettlement where feasible.&#13;
   0    Assist displacedpersons inimproving their former living standards, earning capacity and&#13;
        production levels or at least restoring them.&#13;
   0    Encourage community participation inplanningand implementingresettlement, and&#13;
   0    Provide assistance to affected people regardless o f the legality o f title o f land.&#13;
&#13;
6.      This framework includes guidelines for land contributed inreturn for compensation, for&#13;
land contribution without compensation and for involuntary land acquisition by government for&#13;
sub-projects under the Project. The guiding principle for land acquisition is that where land i s&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -41 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
required for implementation o f the Project it should be provided voluntarily, as a donation&#13;
(without compensation) or in return for compensation, in accordance with the process specified&#13;
below. The Government o f Samoa will take every step to ensure that no land is acquired against&#13;
the will o f the person(s) exercising pule over the land. In the event that such acquisition i s&#13;
unavoidable, it shall be done accordingto the process outlined below.&#13;
&#13;

               protected areas resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihoods o f the displaced&#13;
               persons.&#13;
&#13;
               Involuntary Land Acquisition i s the taking o f land by government for public&#13;
               purpose against compensation where the landowner must surrender their land&#13;
               involuntarily and has only the right to negotiate and appeal the amount o f&#13;
               compensation proposed. This includes land or assets for which the owner enjoys&#13;
               uncontested customary rights.&#13;

    addition to Compensation such as land preparation, credit facilities, training, or&#13;
    job opportunities, needed to enable Displaced Persons to improve their living&#13;
    standards, income earning capacity and production levels, or at least maintain&#13;
    them at pre-Project levels.&#13;
&#13;
    Replacement cost means the method o f valuation o f assets which assists in&#13;
    determining the amount sufficient to replace lost assets and cover transaction&#13;
    costs, as follows: (i)  "Replacement cost for agricultural land" means the pre-&#13;
    project or pre-displacement, whichever is higher, market value o f land o f equal&#13;
    productive potential or use located in the vicinity o f the affected land, plus the&#13;

&#13;
    voluntary Land Contribution refers to a process by which an individual or&#13;
    communal owner agrees to provide land or property for project-related activities.&#13;
    Voluntary Land Contribution may be o f two types: Voluntary Land Contribution&#13;
    for Compensation, or Voluntary Land Contribution without Compensation.&#13;
    Voluntary contribution i s an act o f informed consent, made with the prior&#13;
    knowledge of other options available and their consequences, including the right&#13;

&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
8.      Overall responsibility for the implementation o f this Framework will reside with the&#13;
Ministry o f Natural Resources and Environment, assisted by Ministryo f Works, Transport and&#13;
Infrastructure and the Ministry o f Finance in conjunction with the Contractor company.           The&#13;
MNRE will ensure that the Framework is publicly disseminated and that project staff have the&#13;
requisite skills and knowledge and, where necessary, receive appropriate training to implement&#13;
the framework.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Upon identification o f the specific land area to be acquired, an appointed Department&#13;
representative will initiate negotiations with the village chiefs and orators, matai or beneficial&#13;
owner o f customary land, registered proprietor or DPs. Inter-department cooperation should be&#13;
utilised where appropriate by including both a representative from the Ministry o f Natural&#13;
Resources and Environment andthe Ministry o f Works, Transport andInfrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Clear explanation o f the purpose o f the acquisition, the area o f land required and the DPs&#13;
right to compensation according to the law will be given to all Displaced Persons. Payment of&#13;
any compensation or other entitlements will be completed before any award of contract for civil&#13;
or other works is finalised.&#13;
&#13;
COMPENSATION&#13;
&#13;
11.     The payment o f compensation or other entitlements is to be negotiated and determined&#13;
usingthe following guidelines:&#13;
&#13;
12.     Voluntary Land Contribution with Compensation: Voluntary Land Contribution with&#13;
Compensation refers to a process by which an individual or communal owner agrees to provide&#13;

13.    Voluntary Land Contribution without Compensation. Individuals or groups may elect to&#13;
voluntarily contribute individual or communal land without compensation for use insub-projects&#13;
o f LAMP. Where such donations of lands for the Project are made, there should be arrangements&#13;
to ensure that the donation i s indeed voluntarily given, that the donor i s the legitimate owner o f&#13;
such lands and that the donor i s fully informed o f the nature o f the sub-project and the&#13;
implications o f donating the property.&#13;
&#13;
       (a)      The following safeguards would be applied according to the circumstances o f the&#13;

&#13;
Process for LandAcquisition&#13;
&#13;
14.    The objective is to ensure that persons displaced either physically or economically by the&#13;
Project maintain their livelihood. It shall be the goal of the Project to minimize the physical and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              -46 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
economic displacement o f persons as a result o f the implementation o f the project; provided,&#13;
however, when the involuntary acquisition o f land i s required, the Project shall, first, utilize&#13;
available freehold or public land, second, seek voluntarily donated lands sufficient for the&#13;
purposes o f the Project following the provisions above; third, negotiate provision o f land suitable&#13;
for implementation of the Project against agreed compensation and, only as a last resort, acquire&#13;
landthrough involuntary acquisition following the belowprovisions.&#13;
&#13;
    0   There shall be no involuntary landacquisition o f landand other assets and resettlement of&#13;
        people, unless absolutely necessary. Inparticular, acquisition of sites o f spiritual or&#13;
        cultural significance shall be avoided.&#13;
    0   Ifsuchinvoluntarylandacquisitionis absolutely necessarythenit shallbeminimizedto&#13;
        the greatest extent possible.&#13;
    0   Plans for involuntary acquisition of landand other assets andprovision o frehabilitation&#13;
        measures will be carried out inconsultation with the DisplacedPersons, to ensure&#13;
        minimaldisturbance    .&#13;
    0   The DisplacedPersons will participate throughout the various stages o f the planning and&#13;
        implementation o f the Resettlement Plans. For these purposes and prior to the preparation&#13;
        o fthe Resettlement Plans, the DisplacedPersons, will be informed ofthe provisions o f&#13;
        this Framework andtheir entitlements at public meetings.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The Taking o f Land Act 1964 sets out indetail under Sections 14 &amp; 15 the procedure for&#13;
the acquisition o f customary land and freehold landby Government for public purposes.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Inthepast, governmenthas appealedto the loyalty andpatriotismofitspeopleto allow&#13;
the necessary works o f government for the public good to go unimpeded with assurances for the&#13;
late payment o f compensation. In some cases, such as the case o f communal land owned by&#13;
chiefs and orators o f the villages, communal land required by government for public works i s&#13;
pledged by the village as their contribution to government-works-initiatives. Whereas this&#13;
customary approach may have its advantages, the Ministry has encountered numerous problems&#13;
from landowners subsequently who lodged complaints about government's failure to provide&#13;
compensation as assured many years after the works have been completed. This failure i s&#13;
significant, as it may affect the rights o f the landowner(s) to making application to the Court to&#13;
fix a hllandjust compensation.&#13;
&#13;
17.     The procedure (except for paragraph 1) as prescribed by the Taking o f Land Act 1964 i s&#13;
enumerated hereunder to provide a Work Plan for the Land Acquisition process:&#13;
&#13;

                that Court has determined the matai who has the pule over that land; and in the&#13;
                case o f freehold land ascertain who the registered owner or owners o f the&#13;
                freehold landto be acquired.&#13;
&#13;
        (c)     Cause a survey o f land to be acquired to be made; and a plan to be prepared and&#13;
                certified to be accurate showing:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                            -47-&#13;

        has that pule until the Samoa Land &amp; Titles Court has determined who&#13;
        has that pule.&#13;
&#13;
Cause a copy of such plan to be deposited in the Office o f the Ministry o f&#13;
NaturalResources andthe Environment inApia&#13;
&#13;

o fProclamation andnotify landowner(s) (who may deem it necessary to obtain an&#13;
independent valuation) o f same for compensation purposes. Said compensation,&#13;
however, is to be based on replacement value o f similar land in location and&#13;
productive capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Cause a publicnoticeto bepublishedinthe Savali Newspaper and the Observer;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Send a copy of public notice to each owner, occupier and person having an&#13;
interest in the land or agent of them, whose name and address are readily&#13;
ascertainable stating:&#13;
&#13;
(i)     Government's Proposal to acquire the land;&#13;
(ii)    The public purpose for which it i s wanted;&#13;
(iii)   That the plan may be inspected in the Office o f the Ministry o f Natural&#13;
        Resources and the Environment duringworking hours; and&#13;
(iv)    That any person affectedmay give written notice of objection with reasons&#13;
        to the Chief Executive Officer o f the Ministry o f Natural Resources and&#13;
        the Environment within 28 days of thefirst publicationof theNotice.&#13;
&#13;
Objections: Upon receiving by the Chief Executive Officer o f MNRE any such&#13;
objection with any reason (other than an objection to the amount or the method o f&#13;
payment o f compensation) appoint a time and place in Samoa at which the&#13;
objector may appear before the Minister or some person appointed by him and&#13;
supportthe objection by such evidence andargument as the objector thinks fit.&#13;
&#13;
Dispose of objection(s) and Prepare Proclamation: After the 28 day-period&#13;
from the first publication of the Public Notice in the Savali and/or Observer&#13;
newspaper, and if there are no objections received to the Notice or after due&#13;
consideration o f the objection or objections, the Minister is o f the opinion that&#13;
effect should be given to the proposal to acquire land for the public purpose; and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                          -48 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               that no private injury will be done thereby for which due compensation is not&#13;
               provided by this Act, the Head o f State acting on the advice of the Minister may,&#13;
               by Proclamation, describing the land and stating the public purpose acquire the&#13;
               landfor the public purpose.&#13;
&#13;
               Prepare Proclamationfor landacquired and arrangefor its executionby the&#13;
               Headof State.&#13;
&#13;
               Proclamation to be gazetted and publicly notified as soon as possible;&#13;
               Proclamation to come into effect on the day named inthe Proclamation.&#13;
&#13;
               Registerthe Proclamationinthe LandRegister o f Samoa.&#13;
&#13;
               Pay compensation or secure agreements for payment o f compensation with&#13;
               landowner(s) before commencement o f works.&#13;
&#13;
18.    Processfor the Paymentof Compensation:&#13;
&#13;
       (a)     By agreementbetweenthe Ministerand the Landowner(s):The Minister shall&#13;
               offer such sum as he thinks fit as compensation to that person; and that person&#13;
               may agree with the Minister as to the compensation payable bythe Minister.&#13;
&#13;
       (b)     By the Court if there is no agreement: If the compensation payable is not&#13;
               agreed upon between the Minister and that person, it shall be determined by the&#13;
               Court andinmanner hereinafter prescribed.&#13;
&#13;
       (c)     Claim for compensation statute barred: Five years from the date of the&#13;
               Proclamation, any claim for compensation is statute barred or 12 months after the&#13;
               execution o f the purpose out o f which the claim has arisen in respect o f any&#13;
               damage done to the landacquired.&#13;
&#13;
       (d)     Customary approach to negotiations for and payment of compensation:&#13;
               Where convenient, government may appeal to the traditional and customary&#13;
               loyalty and respect o f the landowners in the interests o f public works by&#13;
               government for the common good, to agree to an amount and time for payment of&#13;
               compensationandto allow works to continue prior to payment.&#13;
&#13;
19.    The manner in which the delicate issue of taking lands for public purposes is handled&#13;
often determines the likelihood of obstacles or resistance from DPs. There i s a commonly held&#13;
understandingthat any matter of contention can be resolved with the customary or traditional&#13;
negotiation and consensus agreement. It is therefore crucial to fully involve local village groups&#13;
andindividuals ina fully transparent process at the inceptiono f anyproject's implementation.&#13;
&#13;
PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION&#13;
&#13;
20.    The process o f consultation, information dissemination and disclosure and planning for&#13;
land contributions with or without compensation shall be as follows:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -49 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   The principles concerning the voluntary nature o f land or property contributions for sub-&#13;
        projects of the Project, including the optionbetween compensation andno compensation,&#13;
        will be disclosed to all potentially affected communities and persons by the MNRE and&#13;
        the personnel trained to act as community liaisons. Once a sub-project has been defined,&#13;
        the MNREteam (assisted, where appropriate, by MOWand other agencies) will facilitate&#13;
        meetings with all potentially affected landholders to explain the likely land andor&#13;
        resettlement implications and to begin the process of negotiation o f compensation and&#13;
        related issues.&#13;
&#13;
    0   The MNRE! team should work closely with the village mayors or Pulenuu who are the&#13;
        established liaisonbetween villages and Government andwho are well informed about all&#13;
        Government projects duringtheir monthlymeetings inApia. As members o f the Alii ma&#13;
        Faipule o f their respective villages, they will assist in the identification o f those who&#13;
        havepule over land required for acquisition by the sub-project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Meetings inthe respective villages with the village councils should be held and also with&#13;
        those who are directly affected andhave control orpule over any landto be acquired. The&#13;
        actual occupants o f the land shouldalso be consulted regarding any possible resettlement&#13;
        or relocation and should also be informed about any compensation to be paid. Every&#13;
        assurance should be made that all key stakeholders have been consulted and are freely&#13;
        entering into the compensation agreement.&#13;
&#13;
ResettlementPlans&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
GRIEVANCEPROCEDURES&#13;
&#13;
26.      Consensus and negotiation are central to Samoan life and decision making. Generally,&#13;
Samoan people are keenly aware o f their standing or "va fealoa'i" with any other person.&#13;
"Tautua" or service to the country and to one's village and family are central to one's life as a&#13;
citizen o f the country. For that reason, many Government initiatives relating to the establishment&#13;
o f infrastructure, water, electricity and other amenities and services have been completed without&#13;
interruption or obstacles being placed before Government by DPs. From experience o f the&#13;
Ministry o f Works, Department of Natural Resources and Environment, and other government&#13;
departments and service Corporations, the initial contact made by the Government's&#13;
representatives with a village or community, is crucial to the success or failure o f any project.&#13;
&#13;
27.      Negotiation and agreement by consensus will provide the best avenue to iron out and&#13;
resolve any grievances expressed by the individuals, the matai or households whose land might&#13;
be affected by sub projects. The MOWshould assure itself that any consensus achieved is freely&#13;
entered into by the main parties involved. The general public should be advised clearly by the&#13;
MOWor other government representative as to who is responsible for and the procedure for&#13;
handling grievances or compensation claims.&#13;
&#13;
28.      Any grievances should be invited and addressed during the verification and appraisal&#13;
process. Ifa suitable solution is not found, the MNRE Team cannot verify the consent forms and&#13;
the sub-project cannot proceed. The issue will then go back to the community for discussion.&#13;
The village may ask the assistance o f the MNRE Team, the NGO responsible for monitoring or&#13;
others to mediate in the compensation process. The mediation process will be implemented&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 52 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
according to traditional methods of mediatiodconflict resolution. The resolution will then be&#13;
documented on the relevant consent forms andverified.&#13;
&#13;
29.    Once agreement is reached concerning the contribution of land, including receipt o f the&#13;
relevant forms of consent, the land donors or other DPs or members o f the community may ask&#13;
the assistance o f the agency responsible for monitoring, or may raise concerns with the MNRE&#13;
team, or may approach the PMU, within 30 days o f the verification meeting. Inthe event such&#13;
concerns are raised, the issue will be referred back to the community for further discussion&#13;
through the traditional process of negotiation and consensus building. This should be clearly&#13;
explained to all communities andDPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MonitoringandEvaluation.&#13;
30.    Supervision and monitoring o f the implementation o f compensation and land acquisition&#13;
should be undertaken by an independent third party such as a local NGO. The role o f the&#13;
independent third party should be explained clearly to DPs in order for them to understand that&#13;
they may approach that entity as an independent thirdparty.&#13;
&#13;
3 1.   The independent third party responsible for monitoring should visit sub-project sites at&#13;
least quarterly, and should monitor the following issues and collect the specified indicators:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Ensure that no construction takes place until all compensation arrangements, including&#13;
       any resettlement, have been fully implementedto the satisfactiono f the DPs;&#13;
    0  Ensure that all land donations have been freely entered into and have not entailed undue&#13;
       pressure or duress;&#13;
    0  Monitor the number of grievances recorded and the disposition o f such grievances;&#13;
    0  Monitor payment o f compensation and receipt o f other entitlements agreed to with&#13;
       respect to the various sub-projects.&#13;

and the Recipient; provided, however, no such agreement to waive the timeframes shall&#13;
adversely affect the rights or interests o f Displaced Persons under this Framework:&#13;
&#13;
    0  The inventory shall be completed at least four months prior to the commencement o f&#13;
       work.&#13;
    0  The Resettlement Plan shall be submittedto the Association for its approval.&#13;

       Association has accepted the Resettlement Plan.&#13;
    0  The compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation activities, if any, will be completed at&#13;
       least one month prior to the commencement o f work.&#13;

            Samoa - Cyclone Emergency Recovery Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Cyclone Emergency
            Recovery Project are to assist the government of Samoa to
            recover from the damage caused by Cyclone Heta and reduce
            the vulnerability of its people to prevailing natural
            hazards through: (a) Recovery of coastal resilience to
            erosion, flooding, and landslide hazards through appropriate
            and sustainable use of structural and non-structural
            protection; (b) Nurturing the recovery of fragile coastal
            ecosystems through sustainable practices; and (c)
            Rehabilitation of damaged land transport communications. The
            main benefits are increased resilience to natural hazards of
            social infrastructure in the coastal areas at highest risk.
            Also access to emergency relief will be more reliable in the
            event of a future disaster. Arrangements for procurement,
            financial management, and implementation address the
            fiduciary risks of the project.
