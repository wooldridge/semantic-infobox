REPUBLIC OF NIGER&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Niger, is a large landlocked country covering an area of 1.27 million km2, and is 600 km away&#13;
from the closest seashore. The population estimated at 8.7 million in 1994--about half of which is less&#13;
than 15 years old--is growing at about 3.3 percent a year which is above the average for Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa. The human resource base is weak with an adult literacy rate of only 14 percent (9 percent among&#13;
women) and a primary school enrollment ratio of less than 30 percent. The slim natural resource base of&#13;
degrading arable land is fragile due to low and irregular rainfall and low and declining soil fertility. As a&#13;
result, Niger's fast growing population is becoming one of the poorest in the world. Per capita GDP has&#13;
declined by more than 52 percent since 1980 reaching US$230 in 1994. The country's social indcators&#13;
are among the lowest in the Sahelian countries. Life expectancy at birth of 47 years is one of the lowest&#13;
on the continent and infant and child mortality rates are high. Niger has an open economy, with imports&#13;
and exports of GNFS exceeding 30 perent of GDP; and strong trade links exist with Nigeria, which&#13;
exerts considerable economic influence through long-standing trading and cultural bonds.&#13;
1.2    Besides the weak natural resource base, Niger faces additional constraints in the form of high&#13;
factor costs, overdependence on uranium, past policies with significant anti-export bias, a relatively&#13;
inefficient public sector and a small modern private sector, which is not competitive. The fall of&#13;
urnamium prices starting in 1981 has revealed a chronic fiscal imbalance with inadequate revenue&#13;
generation and uncontrolled wage bill that have saddled Niger with mounting budget and external&#13;
deficits, and a rapidly rising debt service. To face these special challenges, Niger started in FY96 an&#13;
adjustment program, supported by the Bank, to restore fiscal equilibria and provide for a minimum&#13;
acceptable growth over the long-term. Implementation of the program has been uneven, although&#13;
recently, the accompanying policies to the 1994 develuation have yielded some positive results. General&#13;
economic activity has improved with 4 percent and 3 percent real GDP growth rates respectively for&#13;
1994 and 1995, compared to 1.4 percent in 1993. However, in reaction to a military takeover in late&#13;
January 1996, several important donors have suspended budgetary aid causing uncertaincy for the budget&#13;
situation and medium-term policy outlook. Now that the July 1996 Presidential election is concluded, it&#13;
is expected that assistance to Niger will resume. Government's commitment and action on key reforms,&#13;
the rapid resolution of the political transition, and the resumption of donor assistance will determine the&#13;
feasibility of the reform program.&#13;
1.3   Putting the country back onto a development path will require: the pursuit of the reform agenda;&#13;
the diversion of real resources toward private sector development; and actions to restructure public&#13;
expenditures towards specific objectives to improve primary school enrollment and to increase basic&#13;
primary health coverage. The pursuit of the reform agenda resides in Niger's ability to regain&#13;
donors'confidence through an effective transition to democracy. Sustained success would depend on&#13;
continued fiscal displine and aid flows, political stabilization, and the increase of investments to rekindle&#13;
growth, especially in satisfying the large needs in social infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
II. THE POPULATION. HEALTH AND NUTRITION SECTOR&#13;
A.    Sector Overview&#13;
1. PHN Status: Causes and Consequences&#13;
2.1    Propelled by persistently high fertility (TFR = 7.1), Niger's population of 8.7 million is growing&#13;
at an exceedingly rapid rate of 3.3 percent annually. Life expectancy is estimated at 47 years, infant&#13;
mortality at 123 per thousand live births, child mortality at 223 per thousand, and maternal mortality at&#13;
about 700 per 100,000 births. These indicators compare unfavorably with averages for low income&#13;
countries (life expectancy of 62 years and infant mortality rate of 73 per thousand live births) and put&#13;
Niger among the countries with the highest mortality in the world. Basic indicators for Niger are&#13;
presented in Annex 1.&#13;
2.2    Niger's poor health status results from the high prevalence of tropical communicable and&#13;
parasitic diseases, poor nutrition, high fertility (CPR = 2.3 percent), inadequate preventive and curative&#13;
health services (covering less than one third of Niger's population), low access to safe drinking water&#13;
and sanitation facilities, low levels of literacy and education -- especially among women -- and pervasive&#13;
poverty. The leading causes of mortality for children under the age of 5 years are, in order of&#13;
importance: measles, malaria, diarrhea, malnutrition and respiratory disease. The most frequent causes&#13;
of morbidity for children in this same age group include respiratory infections, malaria, diarrhea and&#13;
afflictions of the eye. Other diseases which severely affect the health of Niger's population include: skin&#13;
affections, urinary tract infections, cerebral-spinal meningitis, yellow fever, cholera, schistosomiaisis,&#13;
Guinea worm, leprosy and polio. Sexually transmitted diseases are estimated to have a prevalence of&#13;
300,000 cases annually, affecting 30 percent of pregnant women in urban areas, and of which 11 percent&#13;
are found in people under the age of 15. Rising HIV infection rates and AIDS cases are of increasing&#13;
public concern. A Bank-supported survey revealed seroprevalence rates in Niamey of 1.3 percent among&#13;
pregnant women, 15.4 percent among prostitutes, 3 percent among truck drivers and 6 percent among&#13;
those carrying STDs. With the growth in AIDS/HV, tuberculosis is resurging as a major public health&#13;
concern. Annex 2 provides more details and data on the epidemiological profile of Niger and also&#13;
presents principal causes of morbidity as reported by health facilities in 1990 and 1991.&#13;
2.3    Malnutrition is very prevalent, but often not diagnosed and generally under-reported. The most&#13;
pressing of problems include protein energy malnutrition, anemia and vitamin A deficiency.&#13;
Approximately 20 percent of newborns have birthweights of less than 2.5 kg. The survey on morbidity&#13;
and mortality carried out in 1985 (period of the severe drought) revealed extremely high prevalence&#13;
rates: 25 percent of children aged 6-59 months were severely malnourished. A national survey carried&#13;
out in 1992 showed that 17 percent of children in this same age group were malnourished. Pockets of&#13;
goiter also exist in several regions of the country, notably: Dosso, Tillaberi and Maradi. Among the&#13;
factors adversely affecting nutritional status in Niger are: severe climatic conditions which cause&#13;
seasonal and sometimes chronic shortages of food crops; inadequate allocation of household income;&#13;
poor weaning practices; and pervasive poverty.&#13;
2.4    Poor PHN status threatens both the quality of life of Niger's population and prospects for&#13;
achieving development goals. With a GDP per capita of US$230 (in 1994), Niger is caught in a vicious&#13;
cycle of poverty and ill health, which has persisted despite national efforts to improve economic and&#13;
social development. Constant ill health limits the country's ability to maximize returns on investments&#13;
in education and training, and to increase its economic productivity. The current population growth rate&#13;
implies the doubling of the population size in less than 25 years -- a rate of increase that will further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
inhibit national efforts to improve the quality of life. Persistently high fertility and mortality have&#13;
culminated in an increasingly youthful age structure: around half of the population is under 15 years old.&#13;
Not only does this impose a severe burden on an under-employed labor force, it also poses greater&#13;
demands on social services, which already are overextended. This will inhibit the country's prospects&#13;
for generating adequate capital for economic growth. Furthermore, population growth that outpaces&#13;
economic growth will contribute to poor nutrition and health status, which will, in turn, inhibit&#13;
productivity and exacerbate poverty.&#13;
2. Structure and Organization of the Health System&#13;
2.5    Niger's public health system is structured around the administrative subdivisions of the country:&#13;
central (or national); internediate (or departmental) and peripheral (composed of three subdivisions:&#13;
arrondissement, communal and village levels). Annex 3 presents the current structure of MOPH&#13;
administration, public health facilities and management committees that make up the health system,&#13;
which are briefly described below.&#13;
2.6    Administration. At the central level, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is composed of the&#13;
cabinet of the Ministry, which includes: the chief of Cabinet, an adviser, an inspector general of health,&#13;
an inspector general of pharmacies and laboratories and the secretary of the Minister. Attached to the&#13;
cabinet are the general secretariat (managed by a secretary general and an assistant secretary general) and&#13;
seven central directorates respectively responsible for: Financial Affairs and Materials; Studies and&#13;
Planning; Family Health; Pharmacies and Laboratories; Preventive Health and Hygiene; Health&#13;
Promotion; and Personnel Training and Management. Central MOPH is responsible for coordinating the&#13;
formulation of sector policy and strategies, prepares investment plans and collaborates with the Ministry&#13;
of Plan in mobilizing resources from external sources. It is responsible for setting and enforcing patient&#13;
care norms and standards. It defines the functions and evaluates the performance of health facilities at&#13;
all levels. Central MOH is also responsible for the deployment, supervision and evaluation of all&#13;
categories of health personnel who work in the health sector.&#13;
2.7    At the regional level, the Departmental Directorate of MOPH (DDS) is responsible for&#13;
managing health programs designed to implement the national health sector policy and strategy as&#13;
adapted to the particular context of the department. The DDS is responsible for the allocation of&#13;
resources within the region and for the provision of support to health facilities in the department and to&#13;
central MOPH in planning, management and evaluation of health sector activities. It has primary&#13;
responsibility for supervision and coordination of health services (curative, preventive and promotional)&#13;
in the department. It monitors the operation of health facilities in order to assure that they function in&#13;
line with MOPH directives and nationally set standards for patient care. The DDS coordinates the&#13;
preparation of draft budget requests submitted to the MOPH for review and inclusion in the sector budget&#13;
proposals. At the arrondissement or commune levels, the chief medical officer supervises primary&#13;
health care facilities operating in the arrondissement or medical circumscription.&#13;
2.8    Public Services. The pyramid of health services offered in Niger is structured as follows. At the&#13;
central level, third level referral services and specialized care are offered through three national&#13;
hospitals (two in Niamey and one in Zinder), which also are responsible for research and training. Also&#13;
offering third level referral services, tertiary care, research and training are a number of specialty centers&#13;
including: the Anti-Leprosy Center; the National Anti-Tuberculosis Center; and the National Family&#13;
Health Center. At the regional level, the Departmental Hospital Center (CHD), the second level referral&#13;
facility, handles complicated cases, requiring medical specialists, which are referred from the&#13;
arrondissement-level medical centers. Among the specialty services offered are surgery, pediatrics and&#13;
internal medicine. The CHD is responsible, among other things, for the in-service training of regional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
clinical staff. Three maternities located in Zinder and Tahoua also provide second level referral services.&#13;
At the arrondissement level, primary health care and first referral serves are provided by the medical&#13;
center, which generally consists of a dispensary, a small hospitalization unit, a maternity, a maternal and&#13;
child health center and a laboratory. At the commune and, in some cases, at the village level, rural&#13;
dispensaries, ward dispensaries and health posts provide primary health care services. Village health&#13;
teams, generally composed of two traditional birth attendants and two first aid workers. provide very&#13;
basic primary services at the village level. These teams cover about 50 percent of Niger's villages.&#13;
2.9    Private Services. The small private sector currently operating in Niger consists of the following:&#13;
10 doctors' offices; 3 practices offering deliveries, prenatal care and family planning; 2 psychologists'&#13;
practices; 3 physiotherapists' practices; 48 health posts; 3 private hospitals (one in Tahoua and 2 in&#13;
Agadez); 5 private clinics; 7 social/medical centers of the National Social Security Fund (CNSS); 13&#13;
private pharmacies (of which 12 in Niamey and I in Maradi); and 215 drug depots (of which 86 are&#13;
cooperatives). As is noted in the policy section of this chapter, Niger is encouraging an expansion in&#13;
private sector activity so as to improve coverage and reallocate public funds to underserved areas.&#13;
2.10   Other MOPH Structures. Over and above those responsible for administration and service&#13;
provision, MOPH also includes structures responsible for training and for carrying out essential functions&#13;
related to pharmaceuticals and laboratories. The Medical Circumscription for Training and Research&#13;
(CIMEFOR), created in 1991, is situated in the medical circumscription of Doutchi (300 km from&#13;
Niamey) and carries out training with a view to: strengthening primary health care delivery; building&#13;
management capacity of district health teams; and improving supervision capacity of medical&#13;
circumscriptions. Two national schools of public health (ENSP), located in Niamey and Zinder, provide&#13;
basic and refresher training in public health and social action and also undertake related research. The&#13;
aim of the National Center for Health Development (CNDS), established in 1991 with French assistance,&#13;
and attached to ENSP/Niger, is to render health personnel better adapted to implement health policy&#13;
reform, with a particular emphasis on community health, management and training. Due to lack of&#13;
recurrent financing the CNDS is not functional. The Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of&#13;
Niamey has been training medical students since 1974.&#13;
2.11   Also under the tutelage of MOPH is the National Office of Pharmaceutical and Chemical&#13;
Products (ONPPC), whose functions include: the supply and distribution of drugs and other medical&#13;
supplies to health facilities across Niger; the production of selected drugs and medical supplies; and,&#13;
through its National Laboratory of Public Health, the quality control of drugs, products of traditional&#13;
pharmacopoeia, food commodities, water and other products, such as pesticides and cosmetics.&#13;
2.12   Management Committees. At the central level, the National Health Committee is responsible&#13;
for all intersectoral coordination and oversight of development questions related to health and health&#13;
policy. It is responsible for adopting implementation plans; proposing changes to health policy;&#13;
reorienting health programs, if needed; and mobilizing resources needed for implementation. The&#13;
Minister of Health is President of this Committee, which meets once annually. The composition of this&#13;
Committee is both multi-sectoral and high-level, encompassing the Ministers of all relevant Ministries&#13;
(National Defense; Finance and Plan; Foreign Affairs; Agriculture and Livestock; Water and&#13;
Enviromnent; National Education; Higher Education; Interior; Communication Youth, Sports and&#13;
Culture; Social Development, Population and Women; Civil Service and Labor); a representative of the&#13;
Economic and Social Affairs Committee of the National Assembly; and the Social Adviser of the Prime&#13;
Minister. The membership of the Departmental Technical Committee (COTEDEP) includes all technical&#13;
directorates at the departmental level and also is opened to representatives of traditional practitioners&#13;
and locally elected officials. The mandate of this committee is intersectoral coordination and oversight&#13;
of all development activities in the department. The Arrondissement Technical Committee (COTEAR)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
and the Communal Technical Committee (COTECOM) are responsible for intersectoral coordination and&#13;
oversight of all development activities, respectively, at the arrondissement and commune levels. As at&#13;
the departmental level, their membership includes all heads of technical units and locally elected&#13;
officials. Over and above these intersectoral committees, whose focus is on all sectors, there currently&#13;
exists in Niger no decentralized intersectoral structures that focus on monitoring and evaluation of health&#13;
sector policy and practice.&#13;
B.    Sector Performance and Key Issues&#13;
1. Quality and Access&#13;
2.13   Inadequate coverage and quality of health services constitute the main impediments to health&#13;
sector performance, The dispersion and rate of growth of the population and the sheer size of the&#13;
territory pose daunting challenges to improvements in service coverage and even to needed&#13;
improvements in the quality of existing services. Low service quality is attributable to: the lack of&#13;
resources available for primary health services; insufficient availability and affordability of essential&#13;
drugs; inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of illnesses; low morale, lack of skills and insufficient&#13;
numbers of service providers. A beneficiary assessment, undertaken as a part of the final evaluation of&#13;
the first IDA investment in the health sector, provides added insight on the low utilization rates in Niger.&#13;
Some personnel are perceived to lack respect and consideration for their clients and, occasionally to lack&#13;
required qualifications. In addition, drug availability -- a top priority for clients of health centers -- is&#13;
unreliable, at best. Weak referral capacities and inadequate support systems (particularly supervision, in-&#13;
service training, logistical and maintenance support) constitute yet other factors, which severely&#13;
compromise the quality of services. In addition, technical services are organized in an excessively&#13;
vertical fashion: particular services are delivered only on particular days of the week. Not only does this&#13;
make services extremely user-unfriendly, this practice also makes service delivery inefficient and in&#13;
contradiction with the primary health care principle of services integration. Finally, there are some key&#13;
primary services, which are neglected, or, at best, ineffectively delivered. Mostly of a preventive and&#13;
promotional nature, these include: family planning services (CPR 2.3 percent); vaccinations (17 percent&#13;
coverage of targeted immunizable diseases in children 12-23 months [14,4 percent if yellow fever is&#13;
added]; and 23,4 percent tetanus coverage of pregnant women); nutrition; and information, education and&#13;
communication activities.&#13;
2. Sector Management&#13;
2.14   The quality and effectiveness of Niger's health system are seriously constrained by weak&#13;
management capacity. Roles and responsibilities for management and decision-making are excessively&#13;
centralized, particularly with regard to management of resources. Those best placed to make informed&#13;
decisions on the optimal use of resources (i.e., those at the more decentralized levels of the system) have&#13;
neither the authority, the means, nor the essential skills for carrying out key management functions. In&#13;
fact, there is a lack of capacity at all levels of the system to carry out functions which are crucial to the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of health sector operations, notably: planning, programming and budgeting;&#13;
resource mobilization and aid coordination; management of human, physical and financial resources;&#13;
training and supervision -- both of a technical and of an administrative nature; quality control; and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, roles and responsibilities at each level of the system for&#13;
carrying out key management functions have not been clearly defined (although it must be noted that&#13;
recent initiatives are addressing this issue).&#13;
2.15   Management tools, systems and processes are ambiguous and underutilized, if they exist at all,&#13;
thus further inhibiting sector effectiveness. There are neither national norms nor rational criteria for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
effective and equitable allocation of sector resources. Budget allocation is based on past patterns without&#13;
due consideration of real needs and equity concerns. Management of material and financial resources is&#13;
inadequate due to the lack of a performing accounting system at all levels of the system. Systems for the&#13;
evaluation of health personnel are inadequate. The setting up of a National Health Information System&#13;
(SNIS) with the assistance of USAID has been a major contribution to improved sector management.&#13;
Established at all levels of services its objective is the collection and analysis of information, its wide&#13;
dissemination and its effective utilization in management and decision-making. It provides information&#13;
on the extent of health problems of Niger's population and key information to facilite, at all levels of the&#13;
system, the management, evaluation and improvements to program performance. Considerable effort,&#13;
however, will be needed to exploit fully the utility of this tool, including: ensuring adequate human&#13;
resources for its use; building capacity at DDS and district levels in its use; and encouraging its full&#13;
analysis and use in decision-making by managers of health facilities.&#13;
2.16   Community Participation and Intersectoral Coordination are basic principles of the primary&#13;
health care approach, embraced by Niger's health policy. Neither of these principles are as yet fully&#13;
applied, however, although efforts are underway to improve performance in this regard. With the&#13;
assistance of the first IDA-financed health project and that of USAID, pilot studies tested community&#13;
participation in the financing of primary health services. These studies have demonstrated, as is the case&#13;
in other countries, that community participation in the financing of health services and in the&#13;
management of collected revenues provides communities with some leverage in their demand for quality&#13;
services and incites the health system to be more client oriented and thus improve that quality. UNICEF&#13;
(through the application of the Barnako Initiative) and projects financed by other partners have also&#13;
applied various notions of community participation in the financing and management of primary health&#13;
services. From this experience, the MOPH is now challenged to develop a framework for eliciting and&#13;
applying nationwide the participation of communities in the financing and management of primary&#13;
health services, in line with their comparative advantages, to render the system more accountable to its&#13;
clients. Again, considerable efforts are being initiated by MOPH to this end.&#13;
2.17   The National Health Committee and its extensions at the departmental, arrondissement and&#13;
commune levels (COTEDEP, COTEAR, COTECOM) (see para. 2.12) have not sufficiently focused on&#13;
the review of health policy and its application. This is due primarily to two factors. First, its mandate is&#13;
intersectoral and holistic in nature, which does not permit it to provide sufficient time to focus&#13;
exclusively on the health sector. Second, even in the application of its intersectoral mandate, the lack of&#13;
clear direction on how to focus on the key issues leaves it ill-equipped to carry out its functions&#13;
concerning the health sector.   While there is much scope for community participation, intersectoral&#13;
coordination and collaboration with other partners (NGOs, private-for-profit sector, academia, etc.),&#13;
particularly at the operational level, no organizational structure exists currently that would effectively&#13;
elicit and coordinate such partnerships.&#13;
2.18   Human Resources. While crucial to achieving national objectives of improving the quality and&#13;
coverage of services, many issues surrounding human resources for health severely dampen efforts in&#13;
this regard. Human resources for health are inadequate in terms of numbers (ratios of technical staff to&#13;
population are far below WHO standards) and distribution (80 percent of technical staff are in and&#13;
around Niamey). Their skills are inadequate due to a number of factors. Basic training curricula are not&#13;
well adapted to the real demands and responsibilities of service provision at the various levels of the&#13;
system in Niger. Neither does in-service training respond to the urgent needs to strengthen service&#13;
delivery quality. Health personnel are very demoralized: salaries are not received regularly; the system&#13;
for management and evaluation of human resources is excessively centralized and is not designed to&#13;
monitor performance and to reward or sanction such performance. The lack of a supervision system&#13;
leaves technical staff isolated and does not give them the opportunity for fine-tuning of their skills and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
positive feedback on their performance. Capacity for manpower planning is very low. Inadequate&#13;
systems and skills for human resources management render MOPH hard-pressed to compile the most&#13;
basic information on numbers of technical staff currently employed, their levels and allocation across the&#13;
country. The human resources implications of the new reforms envisaged under the PDS had not been&#13;
assessed, until the World Bank public expenditure review mission (April 1996) initiated this process.&#13;
Annex 4 provides information on existing human resources for health and on projected needs for the&#13;
next five years in light of planned reforms.&#13;
3. Health Financing and Financial Management&#13;
2.19   As with most Sub-Saharan African countries, there is an inverted expenditure pyramid in Niger.&#13;
Three-quarters of all govemment expenditure on health is for expensive medical care that benefits a&#13;
small minority of the population living in urban areas. A high percentage of the poor and those living in&#13;
the rural areas are not reached by the health care system. In short, the budgetary allocations are both&#13;
inefficient and inequitable. There is scope for improvement and cost savings in most hospitals. This&#13;
would enable funds to be reallocated from hospitals to primary health care and from curative to&#13;
preventive medicine, a shift that could improve access and health across the country.&#13;
2.20   Public expenditures on health have been relatively well protected during the fiscal crisis.&#13;
Health's share of total expenditure increased from 4.2 percent in 1980 to 9.1 percent in 1990, dipped a bit&#13;
in 1991 and then rose in the next two years. The total amount allocated to health was largely protected&#13;
from overall cuts in 1992, and grew considerably through 1994. Per capita spending has increased from&#13;
CFA franc 718 (about US$2.50) per inhabitant in 1980, to CFA franc 1,550 (about US$5.50) in 1990, fell&#13;
for the next 3 years but was budgeted to rise to CFA franc 2,235 per capita (about US$7.70 before the&#13;
devaluation and US$3.85 after) in 1994 (Annex 5, Table 1).&#13;
2.21   In the aggregate, households in Niger spend about 17 billion CFA franc in 1993 on health care-&#13;
about 5.6 percent of total health spending, with urban households accounting for one quarter of out-of-&#13;
pocket payments. There is little difference in the share of household spending devoted to health care by&#13;
level of poverty, although this represents considerable variety in the amounts spent-the non-poor spend 4&#13;
or 5 times as much as the very poor. Rural households spend twice as large a share of income as urban&#13;
households-7.5 percent compared to 4.0 percent-although the CFA franc amounts are very similar for the&#13;
poor and very poor, but much higher for the urban non-poor than the rural non-poor (Annex 5,Table 2).&#13;
C.    National Policy and Medium-Term Sector Strategy&#13;
2.22   Fully aware of the constraints to improved sector performance, the MOPH has prepared a&#13;
statement of health sector policy. Presented in Annex 6, the highlights of this policy statement are&#13;
summarized in this section (annexes I to 3 of the policy statement can be found in the Documents in&#13;
Project File). Three observations on the part of the MOPH provided the rationale for a reorientation in&#13;
Niger's national health policy: (a) the dubious results achieved since independence through the&#13;
elaboration and application of previous health policies; in essence health status has stagnated, if not&#13;
deteriorated, with persistently high infant, child and maternal mortality rates and abysmally low service&#13;
coverage; (b) the decrease in resources allocated to the health sector in light of a rapidly growing&#13;
population and the national economic crisis; and (c) the inadequate organization of the health system,&#13;
which is strongly centralized and which does not elicit participation of communities in sector&#13;
management.&#13;
2.23   In support of a primary health care policy the Government will emphasize prevention through:&#13;
infornation and sensitization of the population; an increase in vaccination coverage; and a reorientation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
of sector investments in favor of better coverage. A particular emphasis will be placed on improving the&#13;
health of mothers and children in the context of an appropriate policy of birth spacing. Drug policy will&#13;
aim to provide to the population essential generic drugs of a sufficient quality and at an affordable price&#13;
and to improve production capacity and supply/distribution policy. In the context of this policy the most&#13;
vulnerable segments of the population will benefit from the organization of national solidarity, whose&#13;
purpose will be partial recovery of health costs and equity. Personnel training programs will be&#13;
strengthened and be more adapted to real needs. Investment programs for health infrastructure will be&#13;
pursued and developed with a view to achieving enhanced decentralization and to bringing services&#13;
closer to the population.&#13;
2.24   The major objective of this new health policy is to ensure continued improvement in health&#13;
status of the population. The strategies through which this will be achieved are as follows: (a) the&#13;
decentralization and reorganization of the health system, important components of which will be the&#13;
establishment of health districts, the restructuring and reform of the pyramid of services and the&#13;
organization of meaningful community participation in the financing and management of services; (b)&#13;
the mobilization and improved management of sector resources: financial, human and physical; (c) the&#13;
geographical extension of health coverage for improved access to services; a particular emphasis will be&#13;
placed on the infrastructure of the health district, which, in principal should cover the majority of health&#13;
needs of the population; (d) more effective training of health personnel, with a particular accent on&#13;
adapting training curricula to real and evolving demands of their various posts in light of sector reforms;&#13;
(e) improvements to service quality, encompassing curative, preventive and promotional services in the&#13;
context of primary health care, with a particular emphasis on: developing first-referral capacity in the&#13;
district hospital (reformed arrondissement-level medical center); preventive services for mothers and&#13;
children; nutrition interventions; family planning services; and water and sanitation activities; (f) control&#13;
of priority diseases, with a particular emphasis on STDs/AIDS, and other parasitic and infectious&#13;
diseases; immunization-targeted diseases (measles, tetanus, polio, whooping cough, tuberculosis);&#13;
treatment and prevention of malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections; and the eradication of&#13;
onchocerciaisis, Guinea worm bilharziose, leprosy and polio; (g) improved availability and management&#13;
of essential generic drugs; and (h) strengthening of information, education and communication capacity&#13;
to elicit change in health behavior.&#13;
2.25   The Government's policy statement also encompasses its health financing policy, which aims to&#13;
increase financial resources for health and to define clearly and elicit the fair and equitable financial&#13;
participation of: the State (an increase in health's share of the recurrent budget from 5 percent to 10&#13;
percent is envisaged by the year 2000); local collectivities (a minimum of 5-8 percent of their recurrent&#13;
budget would be allocated to health), the population (through application of the recently passed cost&#13;
recovery law); the private sector (through extension of service coverage); and aid donors (particularly&#13;
through investments and purchase of medicines).&#13;
2.26   In pursuit of policy objectives, the MOPH has prepared a Health Sector Development Plan&#13;
(PDS) for the period 1994-2000. Based on a sound analysis of the health problems and issues, and of the&#13;
inadequacies of health system  organization and performance, and on lessons learned   from&#13;
implementation experience, it outlines specific objectives, strategies and actions that are key to the&#13;
successful  application of policy principles and the realization of policy objectives.  The main&#13;
components of the PDS are: (a) improve the quality and coverage of basic health services, with a&#13;
particular focus on establishing and supporting the distict health system; (b) improve the availability and&#13;
affordability of essential generic drugs to all of Niger's population through the restructuring and&#13;
strengthening of the pharmaceutical sector; (c) improve sector effectiveness and efficiency through&#13;
interventions to strengthen and decentralize strategic sector management and management of resources;&#13;
and (d) expand and exploit sector capacity through efforts to appreciate more fully and to utilize more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
effectively the capacity of various partners active in the health sector, in implementing national and&#13;
district programs, including but not limited to: communities, NGOs, private-for-profit sector, civil&#13;
society, and academia. This document provides the framework for the development of district plans.&#13;
The planning process at the district level is ongoing and results so far have been impressive and&#13;
encouraging. The process has been very participatory, including visits by the district teams to all&#13;
facilities in the districts, consultations with the population, and involvement of various partners in the&#13;
needs assessment and planning activities: district planning teams include health managers and service&#13;
providers; a local representative of the Ministry of Plan; representatives of other sectors, representatives&#13;
of the population, and, in some cases, representatives of NGOs. In addition, members of particularly&#13;
successful district teams have provided technical assistance to other districts; and a number of workshops&#13;
for district teams have provided them with the opportunity to seek advice from one another and to&#13;
exchange experiences and best practices. District team members have noted that this process has been&#13;
enlightening, particularly with regard to the solicitation of client perspectives, and has profoundly&#13;
influenced plan content and ownership.&#13;
2.27   The quality and detail of the PDS and the ongoing district planning process have provided&#13;
sufficient basis for IDA to opt for a SIP approach for its proposed second investment in the health sector.&#13;
The PDS appropriately embraces a primary health care approach and its strategy is fully consistent with&#13;
cost-effective sector interventions recommended in the 1993 World Development Report and in the&#13;
Africa Region Policy Paper on Better Health for Africa. It constitutes a crucial component of Niger's&#13;
overall development strategy to alleviate poverty and to develop its human resources base; and it is&#13;
consistent with key national objectives, among which are: decentralization, community participation, and&#13;
expansion of private sector involvement. Both MOPH and donors fully embrace the SIP principles,&#13;
which have been reviewed and endorsed by stakeholders during past missions. It must be qualified,&#13;
however, that SIP is not a starting point, but, rather, it is both a process and a medium-term goal to which&#13;
MOPH, the Bank and other donors attach great importance. To date, four of the six criteria for a full SIP&#13;
approach are satisfied. The PDS (a) is sector-wide in scope; (b) encompasses a coherent sector policy&#13;
framework; (c) puts local stakeholders in charge; and (d) emphasizes full use of local capacity and&#13;
minimal use of foreign technical assistance. One criterion is partially met: while all donors support the&#13;
basic principals and strategy of the PDS, they have not yet channeled their ongoing and programmed&#13;
assistance in support of its implementation, due in part to the fact that a multi-year Program, reflecting&#13;
the full costs of its implementation, has not yet been produced.  The last criterion, common&#13;
implementation arrangements, is not yet in place and constitutes a formidable challenge. As a condition&#13;
of project negotiation, and in support of the SIP approach, the Government submitted to IDA a revised&#13;
draft statement of health sector policy, including three annexes (filed in the Documents in Project File),&#13;
which would specify, respectively: (a) selection criteria for districts to be supported under the&#13;
program/project; (b) Government's policy statement on the potential role of the private sector in health;&#13;
and (c) a two-year recruitment and redeployment plan for health sector personnel, which would&#13;
effectively address the human resources implications of the first two years of Program/project&#13;
implementation. The Government has submitted to IDA the final, signed version of this statement,&#13;
which was a condition of Board presentation.&#13;
2.28   In conjunction with the public expenditure review mission, the appraisal mission worked with&#13;
MOPH to initiate the process of transforming the PDS into an initial five-year Program, which would&#13;
provide the full costs of implementing the PDS, thus providing the framework for eliciting and managing&#13;
more effectively donor aid to nationally-set objectives. The proposed project will include interventions&#13;
aimed at institutionalizing this process through capacity building and operational support at the district,&#13;
DDS and central levels. The project will support a process of ongoing review and refinement of the&#13;
Program through which new and revised district plans and programs will be incorporated and other&#13;
elements of the national Program will be revised and refined, as and when more concrete information is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
secured. This process will also provide a mechanism for ongoing efforts to minimize costs and improve&#13;
the effectiveness of the Program. Total Program costs have been provisionally estimated at US$275&#13;
million over a five-year period and will be refined routinely as a part of an annual review and revision of&#13;
Program implementation and costs (para. 3.27). Results of an economic analysis of the PDS are&#13;
summarized in paras. 3.38 and 3.39, and presented in detail in Annex 7.&#13;
2. Composition of Donor Assistance to National Policy and Strategy&#13;
2.29   Current Activity. Some 30 bilateral, multilateral and non-governmental partners have been&#13;
providing assistance to the health sector in Niger. Their combined assistance to the Health Development&#13;
Plan for the next five years is estimated at around US$140 million equivalent -- slightly over 50 percent&#13;
of estimated Program costs for that period. Given that some donors are approaching the end of their&#13;
respective program periods and their new programs of assistance have not yet been approved and&#13;
incorporated into MOPH records, this figure is probably underestimated. Routine updating and exchange&#13;
of information on external financing of the sector, to be supported under the proposed project will&#13;
provide the basis for continuing dialogue with donors on how to further encourage and consolidate a SIP&#13;
approach, to which essentially all -- Government and donors alike -- are committed.&#13;
2.30   Currently available data show that a considerable portion of aid to the health sector is allocated&#13;
to construction/rehabilitation and equipment of health facilities to improve access and quality. Of the 24&#13;
partners on which data are readily available, 17 are financing construction/rehabilitation of health&#13;
facilities at various levels of the system; 13 support maternal and child health and family planning&#13;
activities; 12 support training of health personnel; 7 provide support to the provision of drugs and&#13;
vaccines; 6 support management strengthening interventions; 4 support STDs/AIDS activities; and one&#13;
or two support the following health programs: diarrhea, malaria, leprosy and IEC. Geographic&#13;
subregions benefit from the focused interventions of one or a few donors, causing a balkanization of&#13;
assistance, and consequently, added challenges for MOPH to implement its own health policy and&#13;
harmonize approaches in this regard.  Among the most important partners (and their areas of&#13;
intervention) are: USAID (management strengthening; support to private sector expansion; priority&#13;
health programs and services in selected subregions; IEC and family planning); European Union&#13;
(pharmaceuticals; significant recurrent budget; health programs and services in selected subregions);&#13;
African Development Bank (construction/rehabilitation of health facilities in selected subregions;&#13;
services management); UNICEF (health services through the application of the Bamako Initiative in&#13;
selected subregions; and nutrition activities); IDA's ongoing Population Project (strengthening of&#13;
MCH/FP and reproductive health).&#13;
2.31   Prospects. The extent of external support to the health sector is both an asset and a liability. It&#13;
has furnished sorely needed assistance to improve and expand Niger's health services, but it has also&#13;
coerced MOPH into accepting a project approach, which has at times fragmented efforts, ignored&#13;
national priorities and strategies, and created inequities. In reaction to the coup d'etat of January 1996,&#13;
virtually all bilateral assistance was suspended. However, now that the July 1996 Presidential election is&#13;
concluded, it is expected that development of new projects will resume. Because it is a sound and well&#13;
articulated document, the preparation of the PDS has already stimulated enhanced donor coordination.&#13;
Virtually all donors endorse the district approach proposed in the PDS and have expressed their&#13;
willingness to support its implementation -- some through direct support to districts. Two important&#13;
opportunities must be seized by MOPH to mobilize resources in support of the PDS: (1) negotiations of&#13;
new or renewed programs of several major donors; and (2) the holding of a Health Sector Round Table,&#13;
planned for 1997. The strengthening and decentralization of MOPH capacity for strategic management&#13;
and aid coordination is key to enabling MOPH to take advantage and effectively manage these&#13;
opportunities. In addition, annual reviews and revisions of Program content, costs and financing, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
which all donors will participate (para. 3.27), should serve as an important vehicle: for reviewing the&#13;
availability and relevance of donor financing, for effectively channeling such assistance into a single&#13;
Program, and for possibly mobilizing additional aid to the sector.&#13;
D.    The Bank Group's Role and Sector Assistance Strategy&#13;
1. The First IDA-Funded Health Project (Cr. 1 668-NIR)&#13;
2.32   On March 20, 1986 a first Health Project in Niger was approved by the Board in the amount of&#13;
SDR 25.1 million (US$27.8 million equivalent). The project was closed in June 1995 and an ICR,&#13;
discussed and approved by Bank and Government, will be submitted to the Board in early FY97. Part A&#13;
of the project supported health sector adjustment through: (a) the financing of studies aimed at&#13;
strengthening financial and operational management, improving basic health services, increasing cost&#13;
recovery, improving essential drugs availability and developing population and nutrition policies; and (b)&#13;
the funding of proposals for implementing policies emanating from the above-mentioned studies or&#13;
operational experience. Part B supported improvements in basic health and family planning services&#13;
through activities to: (a) improve facilities and strengthen priority programs; (b) develop health&#13;
education and community initiatives in health and nutrition; and (c) develop health manpower.&#13;
2.33   The objective of assisting the Government in introducing policy reform in the health sector&#13;
within the overall framework of its structural adjustment program was substantially achieved under the&#13;
project. Studies aimed at improving sector policy were carried out and were instrumental in the&#13;
development and initiation of key reform measures. Most program objectives were also substantially&#13;
met. Project investments to upgrade technical skills of service providers and to strengthen infrastructure&#13;
of selected health facilities contributed to improvements in the quality and coverage of basic health&#13;
services. In addition, a number of priority health programs and services were strengthened through&#13;
improved strategic management strengthening and through direct support to implementation activities.&#13;
Program objectives for vaccination coverage and training were not fully achieved, however. While this&#13;
project is considered to be successful overall, it must be qualified that its success is defined through&#13;
process indicators. Persistently high levels of morbidity and mortality and high birth rates demonstrate&#13;
that indeed much remains to be done to improve health status in Niger.&#13;
2.34   Three categories of factors constrained the Government's capacity to implement the project:&#13;
political events; financial constraints; and organizational/managerial constraints. The political events,&#13;
which occurred during the life of the project, caused activities in all sectors to slow down and even to&#13;
come to a standstill. The high tumover of Health Ministers during the life of the project (8 Ministers in 9&#13;
years) caused numerous delays, as each new Minister revisited and questioned project objectives and&#13;
imnplementation progress. Financial constraints included lack of counterpart funds and cash flow&#13;
problems, and inflation propelled by the 1994 devaluation. Management/organizational capacity to&#13;
implement a project of this magnitude and complexity was inadequate. The highly centralized structure&#13;
of the MOPH, heavy bureaucratic and administrative procedures and the vertical structure of health&#13;
programs left decentralized administration and services with, at best, a very passive role in project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2. Population Project (Cr. 2360-NIR)&#13;
2.35   Approved by the Board of Executive Directors on April 30, 1992, this project aims at assisting&#13;
the Government in implementing an effective national population program, with the primary objective of&#13;
accelerating the onset of fertility decline by increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate as rapidly as&#13;
possible, reducing maternal mortality, promoting attitudes favoring a reduction in family size norms, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
enhancing the capacity of women to effectively participate in socio-economic development. An&#13;
important component of this project (about 70 percent of total project cost) is the strengthening of&#13;
maternal and child health services through health infrastructure rehabilitation and technical training. The&#13;
mid-term review of this project, carried out in April 1996, has recommended that this component be&#13;
revised to accommodate fully the reforms and service norms and standards outlined in the PDS. This&#13;
decision is supportive of a SIP approach and will ensure coherence in IDA's support program to Niger's&#13;
health sector development.&#13;
3. Key Lessons Learned&#13;
2.36  It was also learned that program/project objectives should be sufficiently modest and based on a&#13;
sound knowledge of the existing situation. Objectives should be commensurate with the resources put at&#13;
the disposal of program/project staff. Clear targets and indicators should be set at the outset. Key&#13;
stakeholders should be identified at the outset and involved in all stages of design and development. A&#13;
least cost approach should drive the project design and costing exercise. A rolling planning process&#13;
would have introduced both rigor and more flexibility during project implementation. A more holistic&#13;
and rigorous assessment of institutional capacity would have modified project design and introduced&#13;
more deliberate interventions to strengthen that capacity.&#13;
2.37  Inadequate management/institutional capacity is found to be more constraining of good sector&#13;
performance than resource availability. More effort must be devoted to develop capacity in management&#13;
of resources and in decentralized strategic sector management in order to improve sector effectiveness.&#13;
Financial participation of the communities has caused them to be more involved in, and more demanding&#13;
of, health service delivery, prompting the public service to strive to be more client oriented. This process&#13;
should be nurtured and supported in future operations.&#13;
2.38   Concerning project management, the most significant lessons were: the need to provide project&#13;
staff with sufficient training in Bank procedures and requirements; the need for improved mechanisms&#13;
for coordination and communication; and the need to minimize turnover of program management and&#13;
service delivery staff. Implementation experience also revealed the importance of integrating and&#13;
"mainstreaming" project activities more fully into MOPH operations, at all levels.&#13;
2.39  Implementation experience has demonstrated the importance of health personnel supervision.&#13;
Investments in service quality improvements were not fully exploited or consolidated due to a lack of&#13;
technical support and follow-up that should have been provided through the implementation of a well&#13;
designed supervision program. Likewise, a lack of follow-up and evaluation of training investments left&#13;
MOPH incapable of ensuring optimal utilization of newly acquired skills and of assessing the utility of&#13;
training to guide future investments in human resources development. The lack of a clear policy on&#13;
preventive activities and on health education caused them to receive low attention and priority under the&#13;
project, despite the importance attributed to them in project design and documentation. Greater&#13;
emphasis on all of these--supervision, training evaluation, policy on prevention and promotion--would&#13;
have contributed to enhanced service quality.&#13;
2.40  It is encouraging to note that the many of these lessons are reflected already by the Government&#13;
in its Health Sector Development Plan, and by the Bank in its Sector Investment Program (SIP)&#13;
approach. These lessons have featured prominently in sector dialogue and provided an important basis&#13;
for the appraisal of the Government's Program, and of IDA's proposed support to its implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
4. Rationale for IDA Involvement in the Sector&#13;
2.41   IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) emphasizes human resources development as a&#13;
priority objective. IDA's continued involvement will help the Government focus on weaknesses in&#13;
health sector strategic management and management of resources, including aid coordination for&#13;
enhanced sector effectiveness and efficiency. IDA has a comparative advantage in having established a&#13;
successful policy dialogue with the Government on sectoral issues -- a dialogue enhanced most recently&#13;
through a participatory and extensive ICR process, which was deliberately focused on application of&#13;
lessons for improved sector performance. In the spirit of a sector investment approach, IDA support to&#13;
PDS implementation will focus on areas of comparative advantage where IDA can best exploit it&#13;
leverage, experience and expertise (essential drugs, policy reform, macroeconomic linkages, capacity&#13;
building). Also in support of a sector investment approach, IDA financing will be flexible so as to be&#13;
constantly responsive to evolving opportunities and constraints throughout the project's life.&#13;
5. Future IDA Assistance Strategy&#13;
2.42   Key features of the new sector approach, which are guiding the design and implementation of the&#13;
proposed IDA intervention include: a coherent sectoral framework that would provide the basis for&#13;
eliciting and coordinating the various contributions of donors; Government initiation and ownership of&#13;
sector activity and increased partnership activity; a deliberate and systemic approach to capacity&#13;
building, management strengthening and institutional development,, which would encompass the (often&#13;
untapped) potential roles of all partners in sector development; a better appreciation of client&#13;
perspectives and more efforts to respond to the needs and demands of clients; choice of indicators that&#13;
would emphasize performance of the system and impact of interventions; the adoption of a learning&#13;
approach, which would be pragmatic, rather than theoretical, and which would be subject to ongoing&#13;
evaluation and refinement in light of experience; economic and financial viability, encompassing the&#13;
importance of establishing priorities, cost-effectiveness of interventions; a full appreciation of recurrent&#13;
cost implications and cost containment; and the importance of forging better links and partnerships with&#13;
central and other ministries at all levels of the system to understand opportunities and constraints of&#13;
decentralization, public finance, civil service reform, etc. (i.e. macroeconomic linkages) and to improve&#13;
intersectoral coordination and collaboration to achieve better health. This approach has been thoroughly&#13;
discussed and well received by the Government and donors alike.&#13;
III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Program Objectives&#13;
3.1    With the overall objective of improving the health and wellbeing of Niger's population, the PDS&#13;
seeks to: (a) improve the quality and coverage of basic health services, with a particular focus on&#13;
establishing and supporting the district health system; (b) improve the availability and affordability of&#13;
essential generic drugs through the restructuring and strengthening of the pharmaceutical sector; and (c)&#13;
improve sector effectiveness and efficiency through: (i) interventions to strengthen and decentralize&#13;
strategic sector management and management of resources; and (ii) efforts to appreciate more fully and&#13;
to utilize more effectively the capacity of various partners active in the health sector in implementing&#13;
national and district programs.&#13;
B.    Summary of Program Description&#13;
3.2    The implementation of national sector policy and strategy will be carried out through the&#13;
following components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
1.    Improving the Quality and Coverage of Basic Health Services through the&#13;
Establishment and Support of a District Health System (US$242 million&#13;
equivalent):&#13;
3.3    This component will support the restructuring and reform of the pyramid of health services in&#13;
support of a district health approach.  In line with newly established norms and standards for&#13;
infrastructure, equipment and staffing of reformed health facilities, and with the definition of the&#13;
minimum package of services to be offered at each level, this component will (a) upgrade and extend&#13;
district services through the rehabilitation and construction/equipment of health infrastructure (b) improve&#13;
district-level service quality through: activities aimed at better organization of work at the health facility&#13;
level; rational prescription practices; improved integration of services; and improved supervision and in-&#13;
service training of health personnel. This component will also support activities to strengthen patient&#13;
referral capacity and management of district, departmental and national hospitals. This component also&#13;
envisages support to the implementation of cost recovery, including the establishment and application of&#13;
tools for the management of drug stocks and collected revenues; training; and the purchase of drug stocks&#13;
and other essential medical and laboratory supplies for health facilities. In addition, this component will&#13;
strengthen priority programs and services, with a particular emphasis on maternal and child health,&#13;
STD/AIDS, tuberculosis and on prevention and promotional activities.&#13;
2.    Improving the Supply and Distribution of Essential Generic Drugs (US$7 million&#13;
equivalent):&#13;
3.4    This component will contribute to the implementation of strategies deftned in the National&#13;
Pharmaceutical Master Plan, which aims at improving the availability, quality and affordability of&#13;
essential generic drugs to all citizens of Niger. Assistance to the Pharmacy and Laboratory Directorate&#13;
(DPhL) and to the Inspectorate General of Pharmacies and Laboratories would include equipment,&#13;
supplies, material, technical assistance, training and recurrent financing for: the revision of the legal&#13;
framework for pharmaceuticals; establishment of a registration system for drugs; the strengthening of a&#13;
pharmaceutical inspection service; and the development of a national pharmaceutical documentation&#13;
service. The Program also envisages the implementation of Government's decision to demonopolize and&#13;
restructure the ONPPC to permit a dynamic competition in the drug sector and to develop capacity for&#13;
procurement of essential generic drugs.&#13;
3.     Building Capacity and Forging Partnerships in Support of Health Sector Reform'&#13;
(US$27 million equivalent):&#13;
3.5    This component will develop national capacity for strategic management and for management of&#13;
resources to enable MOPH to realize the objectives of the national and district PDS effectively and&#13;
efficiently. Activities will include: establishing the health district; strengthening of management&#13;
capacity of the DDS; and realigning central level functions in light of decentralization and its newly&#13;
evolved role. The component will also develop and strengthen effective partnerships with various&#13;
stakeholders (communities, NGOs, academia, private sector) according to their comparative advantages&#13;
in support of PDS goals. To this end it will support and nurture community participation in the&#13;
management, financing and implementation of sector activities, and it will encourage and support&#13;
district-based innovative activities through contracting arrangements. The component will also support&#13;
project management activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
C.     Detailed Features of IDA Financing&#13;
I.     Improving the Quality and Coverage of Basic Health Services (US$31.5 million&#13;
equivalent)&#13;
3.6    The PDS envisages a restructuring of the health pyramid through the creation of health districts&#13;
with a view to better accommodate primary health care objectives. Within the health district, rural&#13;
dispensaries and some health posts, at the commune and village levels, will be transformed into&#13;
integrated health centers (CSI), which will provide primary health care activities through professional&#13;
paramedical staff; and arrondissement-level medical centers will be transformed into district hospitals,&#13;
comprised of a maternity, surgical facility, general medical facility, a laboratory and a simple&#13;
radiological facility.  Departmental hospital centers (CHD) will be strengthened to provide second&#13;
referral services to district hospitals, and national hospitals will be strengthened to provide third-level&#13;
referral services to CHD.&#13;
3.7    This component will support implementation of PDS objectives to improve the quality of basic&#13;
health services and to extend coverage in selected districts (departments). Diffa, Maine-Soroa (Diffa),&#13;
Goure, Mirriah, Tanout (Zinder) will be supported with IDA financing; and Filingue and Say (Tillaberi)&#13;
will be supported through a proposed parallel financing arrangement with the Netherlands. The&#13;
following criteria established jointly with MOPH during the preappraisal mission and reviewed during&#13;
the appraisal mission guided the choice and prioritization of districts to be supported under this project:&#13;
(a) lower than average coverage -- less than 20-25 percent; (b) readiness of district health plans and&#13;
participatory nature of the planning process; (c) relatively little or no support from other donors and/or&#13;
multiple aid donors supporting district activities, but neither coordinated nor necessarily focused on core&#13;
activities contained in district plans; (d) poverty and isolation of the population; and (e) ongoing, but&#13;
limited Bank support to districts (under the Population Project, Credit 2360-NIR).&#13;
1.1    Strengthening Services at the District Level&#13;
3.8    The primary focus of this component will be to support the implementation of district health&#13;
plans. While coverage is extremely low and in need of expansion, highest priority is being accorded to&#13;
improving the quality of existing services, for which there is much scope. The project will thus upgrade&#13;
and maintain the technical skills of service delivery staff through the refinement and application of&#13;
diagnostic and treatment protocols for addressing the priority health problems in Niger. It will also&#13;
support the development and delivery of refresher and in-service medical/technical training and the&#13;
development and implementation of an integrated supervision system, which will monitor, nurture and&#13;
support skills development.  Specialized training will also be provided to selected medical and&#13;
paramedical staff to enable them to deliver first-referral services at the district hospital effectively.&#13;
3.9    The project will also support adherence of districts to the norms and standards recently&#13;
established for infrastructure, equipment and staffing of health facilities to enable them to deliver the&#13;
minimum package of services defined in the PDS. The project will thus finance the upgrading of&#13;
existing basic and first-referral services through the transformation of rural dispensaries and health posts&#13;
into integrated health centers (CSI) and of medical centers (CM) into district hospitals. The upgrading&#13;
will involve the rehabilitation and/or expansion of existing health infrastructure, the provision of&#13;
replacement and incremental medical and technical equipment, furniture, vehicles and other essential&#13;
material and supplies, and the provision of safe water supplies. The project will also support extension&#13;
of very low coverage in these districts through the construction and full equipment of new integrated&#13;
health centers (CSI). The project will also finance the incremental operating costs to keep rehabilitated&#13;
and new infrastructure maintained and functioning. Adherence to staffing norms and standards for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
reformed and new facilities will require the redeployment, and recruitment of additional personnel.&#13;
Government counterpart financing will cover these costs under the project.  As a condition of&#13;
disbursement for construction and equipment of new health facilities, the Government will provide a&#13;
plan, referred to in annex 3 of the statement of health sector policy, satisfactory to IDA, for&#13;
redeployment, retraining and recruitement of health sector staff to ensure that upgraded and new health&#13;
facilities will be sufficiently staffed and operational in line with MOPH staffing norms. This plan will be&#13;
reviewed and agreed with IDA during the annual programming exercise (para. 3.27) and will be in full&#13;
respect of the Policy Framework Paper (PFP) document, which limits future recruitments (across sectors)&#13;
to replacements of voluntary departures, but which accords highest priority to social sectors. The&#13;
construction and rehabilitation will be reviewed in light of agreed quotas, and revised downward in the&#13;
event that quotas fall short of staffing requirements. Priority will be accorded to staffing of existing,&#13;
upgraded services.&#13;
3.10   The project will support the implementation of the "minimum package of services" (PMA) to be&#13;
delivered through the CSI and district hospital facilities, employing a quality assurance approach.&#13;
Encompassing preventive, promotional and curative activities and the effective management and&#13;
integration of priority health programs, the PMA focuses primarily on the most cost-effective&#13;
interventions aimed at Niger's most vulnerable groups: mothers and children.  Among these&#13;
interventions, those of a preventive/promotional nature include: vaccinations; antimalaria prophylaxis&#13;
and micronutrients for pregnant women; family planning; malnutrition prevention through growth&#13;
surveillance, breastfeeding promotion, weaning practices and nutrition education; prenatal, delivery and&#13;
postnatal care and identification and referral of high-risk pregnancies; water, hygiene and sanitation&#13;
promotion; health education and information; and school health.  Curative interventions include&#13;
management, treatment and proper referral of priority illnesses, such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory&#13;
infections, malaria, measles and severe malnutrition and chronic disease (tuberculosis, leprosy, eye&#13;
disease). Basic management activities include: strategic management (information, operational research,&#13;
monitoring, evaluation, coordination, planning, programming), and management of resources (personnel,&#13;
drugs, material, financial resources). Project support to the implementation of the PMA at the CSI and&#13;
HID levels includes: purchase of material, equipment, drugs and other essential supplies, and the&#13;
financing of various activities, including training, service delivery, information campaigns,&#13;
epidemiological surveillance and other relevant studies, supervision, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
3.11   Support of Cost Recovery Activities. Pilot studies and projects carried out over the past several&#13;
years in the context of IDA's first intervention in the sector have provided the opportunity for much&#13;
acquisition of experience and reflection. Following the adoption in July 1995 of the cost recovery law&#13;
for basic health services, a number of activities have already been undertaken in support of its successful&#13;
application, including: the development of a training program for management of drug stocks and&#13;
revenues from cost recovery; training in good prescription practices and effective use of generics; and&#13;
studies to assess operating costs of districts, encompassing district hospital and CSIs. An overview of&#13;
experience and accomplishments to date can be found in the Documents in Project File. The project will&#13;
support the implementation of cost recovery activities in the project area through the provision of initial&#13;
drug stocks in all CSI and HD in the project area and in the Diffa CHD and Zinder National Hospital,&#13;
and through the establishment and support of management activities. Specifically the project will&#13;
provide technical assistance in streamlining management tools for cost recovery, which are, at present,&#13;
overly complicated and cumbersome. The project will also provide training of HD and CSI personnel&#13;
and of community managers in the utilization of simplified tools for management of drug stocks and for&#13;
the collection and management of financial resources generated through cost recovery activities. In&#13;
addition it will cover the recurrent costs of management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
3.12   Despite the experience accumulated through various pilots, cost recovery is still in an&#13;
experimental phase: to date, collected revenues have not been utilized to cover drugs and other operating&#13;
costs; and cost recovery activity is virtually non-existant at the HD level. Project support to cost&#13;
recovery is thus designed around a learning approach. Financing of studies and monitoring, evaluation&#13;
and supervision activities will permit MOPH to apply lessons and continually review and refine cost&#13;
recovery approaches. Among the elements of this programn that will be reviewed and refined during the&#13;
life of the project are: (a) pricing of drugs and services (during negotiations, the Government gave&#13;
assurances that it will adopt a pricing mechanism for essential generic drugs in both the public and the&#13;
private sectors by March 31, 1998; (b) the clear definition of the costs to be covered by the financial&#13;
participation of communities; (c) the clear definition of costs that will continue to be borne by the public&#13;
budget (e.g., chronic disease for which treatment is expensive [diabetes, tuberculosis, leprosy,&#13;
hypertension]; and financing of essential generic drugs in departmental and national hospitals); (d)&#13;
streamlining of management tools for cost recovery; and (e) more effective and quicker reinvestment of&#13;
revenues to replenish drug stocks and possibly to cover other costs. MOPH has developed criteria for&#13;
determining ability to pay of indigenous clients, which would be applied at the level of the facility with&#13;
input from the communities. Those deemed unable to pay would be exempt from service fees.&#13;
Monitoring of financial access and consequent utilization rates of vulnerable groups and of the success&#13;
rates of direct and indirect cost recovery mechanisms will be carried out under the project. While the&#13;
law on cost recovery for basic health services (Law No. 95-014 of July 3, 1995) was passed almost a year&#13;
ago, the Government decree outlining how this law will be applied nationwide has not yet been signed.&#13;
As a condition of disbursement for drugs, the Government will adopt a decret d'application acceptable&#13;
to IDA, for Law No. 95-014 of July 3, 1995, on cost recovery.&#13;
1.2   Strengthening Patient Referral Capacity of Hospitals&#13;
3.13   The project seeks to strengthen hospital management and patient referral capacity of hospitals&#13;
through the execution of studies, which would clearly define the roles of first-, second- and third-level&#13;
referral facilities (HD, CHD, and national hospital, respectively), and which would outline procedures for&#13;
patient referral between the various levels of services. An additional study would evaluate hospital&#13;
management and recommend ways to improve management systems and practices and thus efficiency of&#13;
hospitals. In line with the recommendations of these studies, the project would rehabilitate and re-equip&#13;
Diffa CHD to enable it to fulfill its role as second-level referral facility. In addition, tools, systems and&#13;
training to strengthen hospital management and patient referral capacity would be developed in line with&#13;
recommendations of these studies. These would be applied in district hospitals covered under this&#13;
project, in Diffa CHD and in the National Hospital of Zinder.&#13;
1.3    National Program for STD/AIDS&#13;
3.14   The project would support Niger's national program  for sexually-transmitted diseases and&#13;
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (STD/AIDS). With a view to strengthening both management&#13;
and implementation of program activities, project assistance would include: purchase of equipment,&#13;
materials, drugs and other essential supplies, technical assistance in program design and management,&#13;
and the financing of program activities, including training, service delivery, patient counseling,&#13;
information, education and communication (IEC) activities, epidemiological surveillance and other&#13;
relevant studies, supervision, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.    Improving the Supply and Distribution of Essential Generic Drugs (US$ 3.7 million&#13;
equivalent)&#13;
3.15   The overall objective of this component is to support MOPH in the implementation of strategies&#13;
defined in its National Pharmaceuticals Master Plan. This assistance will contribute to the development&#13;
of an essential drugs policy, which will ensure that essential drugs and medical supplies included in&#13;
MOPH national list will be: (a) available nationwide; (b) sold at an affordable price in light of the&#13;
purchasing power of the population; (c) sufficiently responsive to quality norms; (d) used rationally; and&#13;
(e) serve as the basis for the application of the recently adopted cost recovery law for basic services.&#13;
Assistance will be delivered through the following two components.&#13;
2.1    Strengthening of DPhL and of the Inspectorate General for Pharmacies and&#13;
Laboratories&#13;
3.16   In order to enable DPhL to guide and oversee the implementation of pharmaceutical policy and&#13;
strategy, the Program will support the following capacity building activities: (a) the revision of the legal&#13;
framework for pharmaceuticals, which will permit the regulation of all drug-related activities and which&#13;
will be included in the Pharmaceutical Chapter of the Public Health Sector Code (during negotiations,&#13;
the Government gave assurances that it will introduce into Parliament at the very latest three months&#13;
after credit effectiveness a draft pharmaceutical law satisfactory to IDA); (b) the establishment of an&#13;
effective registration system for drugs which would, among other things, permit the definition of&#13;
selection criteria for brand-name drugs authorized for commercial activity; (c) the strengthening of a&#13;
pharmaceutical inspection service, and its gradual decentralization to DDS level; and (d) the&#13;
development of a national service of pharmaceutical documentation. Institutional development will be&#13;
achieved through (a) short-term specialized technical assistance; (b) provision of equipment, furniture,&#13;
office equipment; (c) the provision of an initial stock of essential pharmaceutical documents and&#13;
information; (d) financing of fellowships; and (e) financing of essential recurrent costs.&#13;
2.2    Restructuring of ONPPC&#13;
3.17   In the context of the Policy Framework Paper (PFP) discussed with Government in April 1996&#13;
and in line with technical discussions carried out through sector dialogue, the Government has&#13;
committed itself to the demonopolization and restructuring of ONPPC. A plan of action for the&#13;
demonopolisation and restructuring was discussed and agreed and is reflected in the sector policy&#13;
framework paper agreed between the Bank and Government. An important principal behind the&#13;
restructuring of ONPPC is the revision of its legal status in line with its mission. ONPPC should be a&#13;
national enterprise with a social and public health vocation and a non-profit status. While under the&#13;
technical responsibility of MOPH, it would have total financial and managerial autonomy. During&#13;
negotiations, Government gave assurances that it would, at the very latest three months after credit&#13;
effectiveness, introduce into Parliament a law that would demonopolize ONPPC. The restructuring of&#13;
ONPPC must rest on the principal of separate accounting and financial statements for each of the&#13;
discrete functions: quality control and laboratory work; production; and acquisition, distribution and&#13;
retailing. Only when this principal is satisfied, can decisions to privatize and to separate one or more of&#13;
these functions from others be made. During negotiations, Government gave assurances that a new legal&#13;
status for ONPPC's essential drugs procurement unit, satisfactory to IDA, will be adopted no later than&#13;
December 31, 1997. The new legal status will ensure that this unit will fulfill a social mission (the&#13;
provision of essential generic drugs to all of Niger's population at the lowest possible cost) and that it&#13;
will be accorded sufficient managerial and financial autonomy tu run effectively and in accordance with&#13;
standard business practices. During negotiations, Government gave assurances that a new draft legal&#13;
status for the remaining functions of ONPPC (quality control and laboratory, production, and acquisition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
distribution and retailing ) will be presented and reviewed at the time of the mid-term review (before&#13;
end-1999) and final versions, satisfactory to IDA, will be adopted no later than June 30, 2000.&#13;
3.18   Within the overall framework of the restructuring on ONPPC and with support from the EU, the&#13;
following Program activities are envisaged: (a) strengthening of ONPPCs general accounting and&#13;
establishing of an analytical accounting system of the different functional units of ONPPC to provide a&#13;
clear picture of the financial situation of each; (b) negotiations and activities for resolving the problem of&#13;
debts and credits, in light of financial situations of various functions; (c) extending the services of the&#13;
essential drugs procurement unit of ONPPC to all interested clients, including private sector; (d)&#13;
establishment of a simple computerized management system for stock management, billing, monitoring&#13;
of consumption, procurement management and forecasting; (e) strengthening procurement capacity for&#13;
essential generic drugs; (f) restructuring of the unit responsible for purchase of specialty drugs; (g)&#13;
strengthening of stock management procedures; (h) strengthening of financial management; (i)&#13;
improvements to quality assurance activities; (j) study of channels of distribution, logistics and retailing&#13;
of state pharmacies and their eventual transformation into autonomous regional or district depots.&#13;
Activities envisaged to demonopolize ONPPC will be included in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
3.19   Given its importance as a Government strategy, and given the political and financial sensitivities&#13;
associated with the pharmaceutical sector in Africa, a close, participatory and well coordinated approach&#13;
to the monitoring and evaluation of this Program component is strongly recommended. The following&#13;
activities will be closely monitored: (a) for DPhL: elaboration of legal framework for pharmaceuticals;&#13;
dissemination and application of a revised list of essential generic drugs; functioning drug registration&#13;
system; official and operational commission on drugs; and (b) for ONPPC: semiannual audit of accounts&#13;
and management procedures; production costs of essential generic drugs in line with international&#13;
averages; operating costs and margins applied to production costs; good management procedures; good&#13;
logistics; good quality of essential generic drugs; constant availability of essential generic drugs; selling&#13;
prices of essential generic drugs at health facilities.&#13;
3.     Building Capacity and Forging Partnerships in Support of Health&#13;
Sector Reform (US$4.8 million equivalent)&#13;
3.20   The fulfillment of goals and objectives laid out in the PDS is surely a challenge and will require&#13;
considerable effort to mobilize and use most effectively national capacity in this regard. Indeed, the&#13;
most far-reaching and radical reforms included in the PDS are those aimed at strengthening the capacity&#13;
and the efficiency of the public sector through the streamlining and decentralization of key management&#13;
functions and those aimed at expanding sector capacity through the recognition and utilization of the&#13;
potential capacity of other, non-public national partners, including communities, NGOs, academia, and&#13;
the private-for-profit sector, to name only a few. This is a radical departure from current practice and&#13;
could have far-reaching effects.   Decentralization  and participation, together, could  reorient&#13;
accountabilities in a fundamental way. Districts (the operational/services level), rather than central&#13;
MOPH, will be the focal point of health activity, and their needs should drive the setting of priorities, the&#13;
work programs and mandates of the DDS and central levels, and the mobilization, coordination and&#13;
allocation of resources to the sector. Community involvement in the financing and management of&#13;
health sector activity will render the health system much more accountable to the clients it is meant to&#13;
serve. Effective recognition and use of the potential of other national partners in health service delivery,&#13;
support services and management could expand sector capacity significantly without exerting additional&#13;
pressure on an already overextended public sector. The project will support the following activities to&#13;
these ends.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
3.1    Strengthening and Decentralization of Key Management Functions&#13;
3.21   The general objective of this component is to develop national capacity for strategic sector&#13;
management and for management of resources at all levels of MOPH administration to enable it to&#13;
realize the objectives of the national and district PDS in an effective and efficient manner. Given the&#13;
decentralization strategy embraced by the PDS -- most particularly the establishment of health districts --&#13;
a primary focus will be placed on the establishment and strengthening of the district health office (and&#13;
the district health team). Program interventions at the DDS and central levels will be oriented around the&#13;
objective of supporting and providing technical backstopping to district health teams. The real challenge&#13;
of the decentralization reform will be to reorient incentives and accountabilities so that higher levels of&#13;
MOPH administration will be serving and supporting the more peripheral levels rather the reverse.&#13;
Another important emphasis of this component is the nurturing and support of the SIP approach, which&#13;
should be institutionalized within MOPH at all levels.&#13;
3.22   Establishment of Health Districts.  The Government gave assurances that no later than 12&#13;
months after credit effectiveness, the project will establish district health offices and district health teams&#13;
in the project area. It will provide technical assistance and training to establish district health teams and&#13;
to develop their skills in technical and managerial training, supervision and quality control,&#13;
administration, team building, strategic sector management (planning, programming, operational&#13;
research, monitoring and evaluation), and management of human and financial resources. In addition,&#13;
the project will support the development and delivery of training modules for health personnel working&#13;
in district facilities to develop their skills in the organization and management of services, and in the&#13;
management of resources (physical, human and financial). The project will also provide office and&#13;
technical equipment, vehicles, supplies and materials for the district offices, and it will finance operating&#13;
costs of health district management, including, inter alia: communications, supervision, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activities and periodic planning and programming activities. In support of the SIP approach,&#13;
during negotiations, Government provided assurances that, as soon as district health teams have been&#13;
established, districts will undertake, on a quarterly basis, participatory evaluations of performance in&#13;
implementing district plans, with a view to reviewing and refining programs, financing plans and budget&#13;
allocations in light of experience and accomplishments. An important objective of these evaluation&#13;
mettings will be the identification and resolution of constraints to program performance. These&#13;
evaluations will be submitted to the DDS, which will consolidate them at the departmental level.&#13;
3.23   Strengthening of DDS Capacity. The project will finance technical assistance, workshops and&#13;
training to enable the DDS of Diffa, Tillaberi and Zinder to redefine and effectively fulfill their evolving&#13;
roles in light of sector reforms laid out in the PDS. A particular emphasis will be given to the&#13;
development of DDS skills in technical backstopping of districts through the design and implementation&#13;
of training and supervision protocols, team building, administration, strategic sector management and&#13;
management of resources. The project will also provide DDS with necessary incremental equipment,&#13;
vehicles, supplies and materials to enable them to carry out their functions. In addition, incremental&#13;
operating costs of the DDS will be supported under the project, including: communications, supervision,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation and periodic planning and programming activities. In line with the SIP&#13;
approach, during negotiations Government provided assurances that participatory evaluations of&#13;
departmental performance in implementing the PDS (including the collection, consolidation and analysis&#13;
of district plans within a department) will be carried out on a semi-annual basis. On the basis of program&#13;
performance and lessons learned, programs, financing plans and budget allocations will be reviewed and&#13;
revised, and submitted to MOPH central level for review and consolidation.&#13;
3.24   Strengthening of Central MOPH Capacity.  The project will finance technical assistance,&#13;
workshops and other activities which would culminate in the restructuring of central MOPH to enable it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
to fulfill more effectively and efficiently its evolving role in light of sector reforms. A particular&#13;
emphasis will be placed on the integration of health programs and services in support of the district&#13;
health system and in line with the "minimum package of activities" (PMA). A first and crucial activity&#13;
will be the development of an institutional/organizational framework that would clearly define roles and&#13;
responsibilities at all levels of the system for strategic sector management. This would also include the&#13;
preparation/revision of post descriptions, ensuring the coherence and complementarity among the&#13;
functions and responsibilities carried out by the various actors in the system at each level, and clarifying&#13;
the interrelationships of these roles. The project would also support the definition and establishment of&#13;
systems, processes, procedures and management tools that would guide and facilitate the smooth and&#13;
accurate implementation of these functions.  The preparation of operational manuals would be&#13;
undertaken in this regard.&#13;
3.25   An important contribution to building MOPH capacity in strategic sector management will be&#13;
project activities to strengthen and consolidate the various information systems currently available in&#13;
MOPH. With project assistance various information systems will be linked so that they can be used in&#13;
an interactive manner to facilitate evaluation and decision-making. Among the information systems to&#13;
be linked are: MIS, health information system, personnel management system, and infrastructure&#13;
management system.  In addition, the project will support the strengthening of the electronic&#13;
communications system within central MOPH and between the various levels of decentralization.&#13;
Through technical assistance and training, the project will also strengthen MOPH capacity for&#13;
management of human and financial resources. In order to support central MOPH in carrying out its new&#13;
functions, the project will provide necessary equipment, vehicles, supplies and materials and it will&#13;
finance incremental operating costs, including communications, supervision, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
and periodic planning and programming activities.&#13;
3.26   The project would also develop human resources for carrying out the strategic management&#13;
functions, in terms of numbers, skills mix and allocation of staff. Under the Program, additional&#13;
personnel would be assigned and/or existing staff would be reallocated. Long-term and short-term&#13;
training in various elements of strategic management (public health, planning/programming, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation) would also be provided. In addition, in-service training curricula will be developed and&#13;
implemented: training of trainers would be under taken to develop and ultimately implement cascade&#13;
training. Given the importance of strategic management at the district and DDS levels, the design and&#13;
implementation of a viable supervision system for guiding and facilitating strategic sector management&#13;
will also constitute an important project activity. In addition, the project would finance the provision of&#13;
furniture, equipment, vehicles, as well as the recurrent costs to support the implementation of these&#13;
functions.&#13;
3.27   Annual Reviews. To encourage and guide sound strategic management, agreement has been&#13;
reached during negotiations that MOPH would convene annual meetings with all aid donors and NGOs&#13;
active or interested in Niger's health sector to coordinate assistance, exchange experiences and&#13;
harmonize their various approaches to health sector development in different regions of the country and&#13;
at different levels of the health system. These meetings would draw on the participation and input of the&#13;
DDS and health districts on the basis of their respective plans and experiences. Agreement has also been&#13;
reached that the MOPH would undertake annual reviews of Program and project performance in the&#13;
implementation of the PDS, and revision of the following year's plan in light of experience gained,&#13;
lessons learned and emerging opportunities and constraints. An important objective of these reviews, to&#13;
which would be attended by MFP, donors, health service providers, representatives of the population and&#13;
other key stakeholders, is the identification and resolution of constraints to program performance.&#13;
Specifically, the Government would submit to IDA for its review, and to other donors, at least four&#13;
weeks prior to the Annual Review of Program Performance (to occur no later than April 30 of each year),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
an annual sector performance report, to be prepared by district health teams and consolidated at DDS and&#13;
central levels, on the progress made in the implementation of the Program. This report would focus on&#13;
key performance indicators (summarized in para. 3.33 and shown in detail in Annex 8) and would&#13;
highlight successes and constraints in achieving Program objectives. It would also assess compliance&#13;
with financial, audit and other covenants relating to the project. Drawing on lessons of the previous&#13;
year's experience, this report would also include the following forward-looking elements: (a) the updated&#13;
three-year rolling development plan for the health sector; (b) Government's salary and non-salary&#13;
recurrent budget allocations to the health sector for the following fiscal year; (c) an action plan for the&#13;
implementation of the Program and the project for the forthcoming FY, including a proposed budget and&#13;
financing plan and a detailed staffing plan for facilities to be built, rehabilitated or upgraded and&#13;
proposing solutions to implementation problems and constraints; and (d) an assessment of the continued&#13;
relevance of the five districts in the project area for IDA intervention. This report would be discussed&#13;
and reviewed on the occasion of the Annual Review and its forward-looking elements finalized in light&#13;
of discussions and conclusions and in consideration of IDA's opinion. Following the Annual Reviews&#13;
the Government would implement these elements and would take any corrective action deemed&#13;
necessary to remedy constraints identified during the Review or any other measures to facilitate&#13;
achievement of Program objectives.&#13;
3.2    Development and Strengthening of Partnerships in Health&#13;
3.28   In light of the intersectoral and multidisciplinary nature of the health sector and in support of the&#13;
decentralization and integration strategies embraced by the PDS, the objective of this component is to&#13;
mobilize and more fully utilize the capacity of the various stakeholders and beneficiaries in the&#13;
elaboration, implementation, management and evaluation of national health policy and practice. Such&#13;
capacity is currently underappreciated, underutilized and ill coordinated, despite the need to supplement&#13;
the capacity and resources of MOPH to implement the PDS. This component will thus seek to exploit&#13;
more fully the capacities and potential contributions of the various partners in health (NGOs,&#13;
communities, civil society, academia, etc.) to permit them (a) to contribute to PDS implementation in&#13;
line with their comparative advantages, and (b) to combine and coordinate more effectively their efforts&#13;
and resources (human, financial, physical) in support of the implementation of national and district plans.&#13;
3.29   Community Participation. Various approaches are being tried in Niger to increase community&#13;
participation. Within the framework of myriad ongoing projects and initiatives, communities have&#13;
contributed to health sector activity through labor and in-kind inputs and through financial inputs in the&#13;
context of cost recovery pilots. Most recently, communities have participated in a meaningful way in the&#13;
elaboration of district health plans, including the analysis of sector issues and constraints, and the&#13;
planning and programming of priority interventions. This participation has prompted the population to&#13;
be more demanding of service quality and to insist on more decision-making power, and has culminated&#13;
in a deep-rooted ownership of district health plans. Currently all actors involved in sector reform are&#13;
searching for mechanisms for community participation. The PDS tries to address the issue through&#13;
creation of structures and committees at the district level and below. However, it is not clear whether&#13;
these structures and committees will truly represent the populations they are meant to serve.&#13;
3.30   Strengthening of community participation in health will thus be undertaken through a learning&#13;
approach. The project will support a number of activities to permit MOPH and other national partners to&#13;
appreciate and benefit from relevant experience in the subregion and, as well, to deepen and enhance its&#13;
own national experience in this regard. It will finance study tours to Mali and Benin, and possibly&#13;
additional African countries, which have considerable experience in health sector community&#13;
participation. The project will also support the implementation, review and finetuning of community&#13;
participation mechanisms, as laid out in the PDS. Specifically, it will finance: training of health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
personnel and committee members in management and participatory techniques; studies and operational&#13;
research; and exchanges of experience among the various districts covered under the project. In&#13;
addition, the beneficiary assessments, to be carried out at the project's outset and at the time of the mid-&#13;
term review (para. 4.5), will gather information and insight on what role the population feels it should&#13;
play in the strategic management and implementation of health sector activity. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances was received from Government that, by the time of the mid-term review, it will have carried&#13;
out an evaluation of the community participation experience and prepared a draft legal framework for&#13;
community participation in health satisfactory to IDA. This evaluation and draft legal framework would&#13;
be discussed and reviewed at the mid-term review and the legal framework submitted to Parliament for&#13;
its adoption after the mid-term review workshop.&#13;
3.31   Community Initiatives through Contracting. With a view to expanding capacity of district health&#13;
personnel and to achieving a fuller appreciation and utilization of non-public sector capacity, the project&#13;
will finance small contracts between the districts and various partners in the communities. These&#13;
contracts would be the vehicle for implementation of crucial, cost-effective elements of the district PDS,&#13;
which tend to be neglected (in Niger and elsewhere in the subregion), and for which public sector health&#13;
personnel do not necessarily have a comparative advantage. Contracts would be small-scale and oriented&#13;
around preventive and health promotional activities, with a particular focus on health problems and&#13;
issues of Niger's two most vulnerable groups: mothers and children. They also may have a public health&#13;
orientation (water, hygiene, santiation, school health...) or they may target essential support activities to&#13;
health operations (maintenance, operational research). Partners eligible for entering into small contracts&#13;
with the health district would include: community- or district-based groups, organizations, associations&#13;
and NGOs, local/national training, consulting and research institutions, and qualified individuals (such as&#13;
students of public health, traditional practitioners, trained service providers not employed by the public&#13;
sector, and village health workers). Procedures for the review and award of contracts by the districts, for&#13;
disbursement against contracts by the DDS, and for supervision and verification of contract&#13;
implementation by both the districts and the DDS will be spelled out in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
As this is a new initiative, the effectiveness and outcome of small-scale district contracting will be&#13;
evaluated at the time of the mid-term review and possibly extended to other districts beyond those five&#13;
initially covered under the project, if proven to be successful. Indicators to evaluate the pilot phase of&#13;
this initiative were discussed and reviewed during negotiations and were included in a supplemental&#13;
letter.&#13;
3.3    Project Management and Coordination&#13;
3.32   To support and assist MOPH  in carrying out the various functions inherent to project&#13;
management and coordination and responsive to a sector investment approach, the MOPH at all levels&#13;
(central, departmental and district) would be strengthened through the provision of technical assistance,&#13;
training, equipment and materials, and logistical inputs to facilitate monitoring and evalutation and&#13;
supervision functions. Further details on the project management and coordination structure are found in&#13;
Chapter IV.&#13;
D.    Indicators for Program Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.33   In line with Bank guidelines, indicators were reviewed and discussed with MOPH.  Six&#13;
indicators for implementation (input and output) and six for outcome/impact have been selected jointly&#13;
with Government. The implementation indicators are: number of facilities rehabilitated/constructed and&#13;
equipped; number of service delivery staff trained; availability in health facilities of drugs included in&#13;
Government's official essential generic drugs list, frequency of orders for stock replenishment, and&#13;
number and duration of ruptures in essential drugs stocks; number of district health teams trained and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
functioning; number of planning/programming meetings taking place at the district, DDS and central&#13;
levels; and number of small-scale service contracts awarded by the districts to various local partners.&#13;
The outcome/impact indicators are: health coverage, utilization rates, annual recurrent expenditures of&#13;
district health facilities vs. real annual costs, planned vs. actual financial contributions of key financiers&#13;
(communities through cost recovery, local collectivities, and central budget), transformation of the PDS&#13;
into a multi-year Program, which should serve as an instrument for strategic sector management and aid&#13;
coordination (number of annual action plans prepared), and permanent and meaningful participation by&#13;
the population in strategic sector management (number of functioning community management&#13;
committees). These indicators, presented in Annex 8, were deemed appropriate, given the reform nature&#13;
of the Program. In addition to these, however, the health status of the population in the five districts to be&#13;
covered under the project and their own evaluation of health service quality will be tracked, respectively,&#13;
through three epidemiological surveys and three beneficiary assessments to be carried out at the project's&#13;
outset, mid-term, and completion. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements are discussed in para. 4.5.&#13;
E.       Program  Costs and Financing and Financial Sustainability&#13;
3.34    Program  Costs. The total cost of PDS implementation over the next five years is estimated at&#13;
about US$275 million equivalent, of which US$135million equivalent is for investment and US$140&#13;
million equivalent is for recurrent costs. Over 75 percent of total costs will support district (basic and&#13;
first-referral) health services. Table 3.1 summarizes the Program costs by component and sources of&#13;
financing, and Table 3.2 summarizes it by expenditure category and sources of financing. Annex 7&#13;
provides financing and costing details and basic assumptions for calculating the costs.&#13;

3.35    Program  Financing  Government is expected to contribute US$116.4 million equivalent over&#13;
the program period, of which US$7.8 million for investments and US$108.6 million for recurrent costs.&#13;
Local administrative budgets (collectivites locales) will contribute some US$5.7 million for investment&#13;
(US$3.1 million equivalent) and recurrent (US$2.6 million equivalent) costs. In addition, revenues&#13;
generated from cost recovery are estimated to finance some US$10.4 million equivalent of recurrent drug&#13;
costs. These estimates are based on MOPH's health financing policy, as proposed in the PDS (and&#13;
supported in the PFP), which specifies that: health's share of the State recurrent budget should increase&#13;
from its current (1996) level of 6.6 percent to 10 percent by the year 2000; that a minimum of 5-8&#13;
percent of local administrative budgets should be allocated to health; and that revenues generated from&#13;
cost recovery should eventually cover 100 percent of drug costs at the primary level, and a progressively&#13;
smaller percentage for the higher levels of care. IDA will contribute US$40.0 million equivalent, and the&#13;
balance of PDS costs (US$103.0 million equivalent) will be covered by the various external partners&#13;
active in the sector (multilateral and bilateral agencies and NGOs), as laid out in their program&#13;
commitments. MOPH's challenge will be to manage effectively external aid coming into the sector and&#13;
to channel it directly to cover activities included in the PDS. Given the quality and appropriateness of&#13;
the PDS document, donors have expressed willingness to contribute to its objectives and are keen to&#13;
achieve better coordination in the sector. Annual review meetings of Program costs and financing (para.&#13;
3.27), and a possible Donors' Round Table in 1997 will be important vehicles for this work.&#13;
3.36    Financial Sustainability. By the end of the initial five-year period, recurrent costs of health&#13;
system functioning (encompassing already existing and incremental recurrent costs) will amount to about&#13;
US$33 million equivalent annually. National contributions to annual recurrent costs by the end of the&#13;
project are projected to exceed this amount, encompassing the financial participation of Government&#13;
(US$24.8 million equivalent), local administrative budgets (US$0.8 million equivalent) and revenues&#13;
generated from cost recovery (US$5.4 million equivalent). These estimates, detailed in Annex 7,&#13;
Appendix 1, are based on the assumption that the projected financial contributions of the various&#13;
national partners, as laid out in the PDS will, in fact, be realized. This objective is feasible but at the&#13;
same time, a challenge, and will be monitored very closely over the Program period. It must be noted&#13;
that, given Niger's very precarious economic and financial situation, implementation of an eventual&#13;
second phase of the PDS will require the support of external partners over the medium-term. The health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
financing policy laid out in the PDS is cognizant of this very real constraint and takes into account the&#13;
programmed contributions of external partners, including NGOs, who have contributed, and will&#13;
continue to contribute both to investment and recurrent costs.&#13;
3.37   These estimates are tentative, at best, and provide only a basis for continued monitoring and&#13;
refinement in light of experience. The public expenditure review and health missions provided an&#13;
opportunity to collect information and establish a data base on costs and financing of the PDS. This&#13;
work represents an important, albeit initial, step. A crucial next step will be the ongoing review and&#13;
refinement of program costs, objectives and financing plans in light of experience. The PDS, with&#13;
assistance from the proposed project, will strengthen MOPH capacity in programming, budgeting and&#13;
financial planning, monitoring and evaluation to this end. An important instrument in monitoring and&#13;
evaluating program sustainability will be the annual reviews of program performance, which will review&#13;
Program costs and financing (actual and projections) and pace of implementation. Depending on&#13;
Program experience and perspectives for the future any one or several of these variables may well be&#13;
revised to ensure the feasibility and financial sustainability of Program content.&#13;
F.     Economic Analysis&#13;
3.38   The 1993 World Development Report (WDR) evaluated the cost effectiveness of various health&#13;
interventions and found two clusters of selected interventions to be highly cost effective: (a) public&#13;
health interventions (immunizations, family planning, improvements to household environment, AIDS&#13;
prevention, and school-based services); and (b) clinical services (pregnancy related care, family&#13;
planning, STD prevention and control, control of tuberculosis, and prevention and treatment of diseases,&#13;
which most severely affect adult, infant and child mortality: acute respiratory infections, measles,&#13;
malaria and acute malnutrition). Africa region-specific economic analysis carried out in the context of&#13;
Better Health for Africa (BHA) has revealed that these cost-effective interventions provided in the form&#13;
of a minimum package of services, through a well-functioning district system with proper referral&#13;
capacity, should enable African countries to manage more than 90 percent of health care demands; and&#13;
reduce the burden of disease by 30 percent.&#13;
3.39    An economic analysis of the PDS, with input from the public expenditure review mission,&#13;
evaluated the appropriateness, affordability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of reforms, approaches and&#13;
activities envisaged in the government's Program document. Results of this analysis show that Niger's&#13;
PDS is perfectly in line with recommendations of WDR  '93 and with BHA for achieving cost&#13;
effectiveness, both through its choice of interventions and through its proposed mode of delivery. Both&#13;
the Bank and MOPH acknowledged, however, that national and district PDS goals and objectives are&#13;
very ambitious, given a number of constraints, including: timeframe, management and absorptive&#13;
capacity, human resources implications, recurrent financing implications and political instability. An&#13;
important lesson learned from the implementation of the first IDA-financed health project was the need&#13;
to set goals and objectives that are cognizant of and commensurate with implementation constraints.&#13;
This economic analysis thus aimed to provide concrete guidance on where and how the risks and&#13;
constraints would be mitigated, the costs of implementing the PDS might be minimized, and how the&#13;
effectiveness of proposed interventions could be maximized, and to provide guidance on how to set&#13;
priorities and phase interventions, in light of these constraints. The results of this analysis have served to&#13;
refine Program design and interventions (including IDA's planned support to Program implementation),&#13;
and also should serve to guide the transformation of the national and district PDS into a detailed working&#13;
Program. The findings and recommendations of the economic analysis are fully subscribed to by MOPH&#13;
and are presented in Annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

G.     Program Sustainability&#13;
3.40   More efficient management of human, material and financial resources will enable the sector to&#13;
achieve a greater measure of sustained growth. Profits generated from the sale of drugs would be used&#13;
by communities to reconstitute stocks. Cost recovery for drugs would also enable the GON to divert&#13;
funding from drug purchase to essential operation and maintenance expenditures. The project will&#13;
facilitate integration of specific prevention programs for the control of endemic diseases into the&#13;
mainstream of primary health care contributing to a more efficient use of limited resources. Clearer&#13;
demarcation of primary health care and referral services and the shifting of expenditures from the more&#13;
costly clinical care toward basic health care and preventive medicine should reduce use of higher tier&#13;
facilities for services that could be provided at a lesser cost at lower levels. In this instance as well, cost&#13;
effectiveness gains should be made.  Improved quality of health service through training and&#13;
redeployment of personnel to primary health care facilities, and availability of drugs at affordable prices&#13;
should stimulate increased and more effective utilization of health services. Revision of MOPH policy&#13;
and strategy for human resources and revision of MOPH health financing policy in light of cost recovery&#13;
should also contribute to the increased sustainability of implementing the national and district-level PDS.&#13;
Decentralized and participatory strategic management to be supported and nurtured under this project&#13;
should result in increased ownership of the PDS by the various stakeholders -- perhaps the most&#13;
important contributing factor of all to long-term sustainability of interventions. MOPH commitment to&#13;
achieving a greater client orientation is reflected in its intention to carry out periodic beneficiary&#13;
assessments. The beneficiary assessment, itself, is a key tool for enhancing project sustainability in that&#13;
it provides periodic feedback on the degree of client identification and, ultimately, ownership of sector&#13;
reform initiatives. The institutionalization of the beneficiary assessment approach is a major aspect of&#13;
management reform envisaged in the Program and underscores an effort on the part of MOPH to&#13;
improve on an ongoing basis the quality of its operations.&#13;
IV. PROGRAM AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.     Status of Program and Project Preparation&#13;
4.1    The proposed project was prepared in response to a request from the MOPH to IDA to assist in&#13;
supporting the implementation of the main reforms contained in the PDS and in strengthening MOPH&#13;
capacity for strategic sector management and aid coordination. The PDS and district plans (about 17 to&#13;
date) have been prepared by the MOPH in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including&#13;
other ministries, private sector health care providers and non-governmental organization (NGOs),&#13;
community representatives, and multilateral agencies, including USAID, EU, WHO, AfDB, UNICEF,&#13;
UNFPA and IDA. A Japanese Grant has financed most of the preparation activities, particularly&#13;
consultancies, studies and support to the district planning process. Additional funding assistance is&#13;
provided through a project preparation facility (PPF) to cover for the costs of preparation and start-up&#13;
activities to be carried out prior to credit effectiveness. These activities consist primarily of studies to&#13;
collect baseline data (epidemiological survey and beneficiary assessment) in the project area, technical&#13;
assistance, workshops and training to establish district health teams, to strengthen DDS capacity to&#13;
prepare the ground for decentralization of key management functions and also to establish project&#13;
management and coordination in the MOPH.&#13;
B.     Participatory Approach&#13;
4.2    MOPH's commitment to decentralized, participatory planning is evident in the ongoing district&#13;
planning exercise through which key stakeholders at the district level, including representatives of the&#13;
population, are initiating a strategic management process within the framework of the PDS. Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
preparation of the PDS and Bank missions have been carried out through extensive field visits, and&#13;
workshops and discussions with a spectrum of stakeholders both in and outside of Niamey. In addition&#13;
to efforts to institutionalize involvement of beneficiaries and other stakeholders, a baseline beneficiary&#13;
assessment will be carried out in the project zone at the outset and will be repeated periodically during&#13;
the project life -- and eventually extended to all districts. In addition, the design of this project draws&#13;
heavily on the outcome of the ICR for the IDA's first health intervention, which sought and reflected a&#13;
spectrum of (often varied) perspectives, including those of: communities, service providers, MOH&#13;
technical and managerial staff at the central and departmental levels, the unions and an independent&#13;
evaluator.&#13;
C.     Management and Coordination of Implementation&#13;
4.3   In support of the decentralization strategy embraced by the PDS and in light of lessons learned&#13;
under IDA's first investment in the sector, Program and project management will be fully integrated into&#13;
the MOPH structure so that the technical directorates at the center, as well as the decentralized levels of&#13;
MOPH (DDS and districts) will be given full and direct responsibility for implementing the various&#13;
components of the project. Annex 3 shows the organizational structure of the MOPH and the project&#13;
management structure, and gives details on the functions of key directorates in the MOPH.&#13;
4.4    The Secretary General of the MOPH will be responsible for overseeing program and project&#13;
management and coordination and for ensuring its smooth and efficient implementation. The Directorate&#13;
of Studies and Planning (DEP) will oversee all sector investments and will be strengthened during the&#13;
program  period to take on the management and coordination of program  implementation.  The&#13;
Directorate of Financial Affairs and Materials (DAF/M) will have overall responsibility for procurement&#13;
and disbursement activities required by the program. These functions will be handled by the two&#13;
relevant divisions of the DAF/M. The Division of Materials will be responsible for procurement&#13;
activities as described in para. 4.18, while the Division of Financial Affairs will be responsible for&#13;
disbursement and accounting/financial activities, as described in para. 4.27. A Project Coordinator (full-&#13;
time civil servant) attached to the MOPH's General Secretariat, who has been nominated prior to&#13;
negotiations, is responsible for: (a) facilitating implementation of project activities by the different&#13;
central level directorates and the concerned DDS; (b) working closely with the DAF/M to ensure that&#13;
accounting, auditing, and procurement procedures agreed to with IDA are respected and carried out&#13;
according to agreed implementation and procurement plans; and (c) maintaining regular contact with the&#13;
Bank on the technical aspects of project implementation. To assist MOPH and to supplement capacity, a&#13;
locally recruited long-term consultant with experience in the management of externally-funded health&#13;
projects, aid coordination and participation will advise MOPH staff on program coordination and&#13;
management and on reform implementation. The recruitment of this adviser with qualifications and&#13;
experience satisfactory to IDA was a condition of Board Presentation. During negotiations, Government&#13;
gave assurances that it would maintain until project completion the adviser to the MOPH and that overall&#13;
responsibility for project coordination in each of the three DDS to benefit from direct IDA assistance&#13;
would rest with the DDS director, who would delegate day-to-day coordination functions to his deputy.&#13;
These deputies (or departmental coordinators), whose appointment would be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness, would be responsible for project management and supervision at the DDS level. During&#13;
negotiations, Government gave assurances that DDS staff designated to act as departmental Project&#13;
Coordinators shall, at all times until completion of the Project, have qualifications and experience&#13;
satisfactory to IDA and that the staff of each of the three DDS would include at all times a financial&#13;
specialist with qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA. Specific responsibilities of these&#13;
coordinators would include: facilitating implementation of project activities at the DDS level; working&#13;
closely with all relevant services of the DDS; maintaining regular contact with donors and with the two&#13;
central directorates (DEP and DAF/M) on the technical aspects of project implementation; providing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
advice and assistance to the DDS and its various services in program management and aid coordination&#13;
in light of experience and responsibilities inherent in this position; and attending quarterly meetings held&#13;
at the district level (para. 4.6). Training of key staff at the central and DDS levels as well as technical&#13;
assistance will be provided for under the Japanese Grant and the PPF. A project operational manual,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, which will lay out roles, responsibilities, procedures and processes for the&#13;
coordination, management, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of project activities (including&#13;
the refinement and agreement on appropriate performance indicators), will be adopted and submitted to&#13;
IDA as condition of effectiveness. The manual will also provide guidance on procurement and&#13;
disbursement, accounting, auditing and reporting. The project operational manual (including the policy&#13;
and procedures manual for contracting arrangements for small-scale services at the district level -- para.&#13;
3.31) will be discussed during the project launch workshop, scheduled to take place at the latest shortly&#13;
after effectiveness. This manual will include a detailed first year work program (implementation plan).&#13;
D.    Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision&#13;
1. Monitoring and Evaluation.&#13;
4.5    Careful and regular monitoring and evaluation of the program is needed to assist in taking timely&#13;
measures to address and resolve implementation difficulties. The district health teams will take a lead&#13;
role in program monitoring and evaluation and, as such, will provide the mechanism for eliciting the&#13;
inputs from Government, beneficiaries and donors in this regard. In order to strengthen the capacity of&#13;
the district health teams and the staff at the DDS and the central levels in playing this role, the project&#13;
will provide training in key areas of management at the onset of project implementation. Key indicators&#13;
selected for tracking implementation and output/impact are described in para. 3.33 and presented in&#13;
Annex 8. Beneficiary assessments and epidemiological surveys will be carried out in selected districts to&#13;
provide baseline data both of a qualitative and quantitative nature and will be undertaken at the project mid-&#13;
term and at its end to monitor and measure project performance. The epidemiological surveys will permit&#13;
tracking of changes in health status, while the beneficiary assessments will provide clients with a means for&#13;
voicing their needs, preferences and assessment of service delivery quality and will shed light on the&#13;
effectiveness of mechanisms for community participation in sector management.  Monitoring and&#13;
evaluation arrangements will provide: (a) a systematic measure of performing and non performing health&#13;
facilities; (b) a means for carefully assessing the critical factors associated with the quality of health service&#13;
delivery; and (c) an assessment in the development of health care coverage. Beneficiaries and other&#13;
stakeholders will be deliberately involved in the monitoring and evaluation process. MOPH MIS capacity&#13;
is sufficiently strong thanks to USAID assistance, and will be an important instrument for project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. Details on monitoring and evaluation activities will be described in the&#13;
Operational Manual.&#13;
2. Supervision&#13;
4.6    Government. District, departmental and central level personnel will supervise project activities&#13;
during their regularly scheduled supervision trips. Their tasks will be, among other things, to address any&#13;
issues hindering smooth implementation of the Program. In certain cases they will be expected to alert&#13;
relevant authorities on problems needing immediate actions (i.e., staff sanctions, training, etc.). The district&#13;
health teams will each meet quarterly to review progress and discuss and resolve field-level project&#13;
implementation problems; the DDS will meet semiannually to review progress on program/project&#13;
implementation and to discuss and resolve departmental level issues. Semiannual reports will be prepared&#13;
by the DEP based on the results of the departmental meetings indicating the program's physical/financial&#13;
status as well as its progress on the institutional issues. The project coordinator would also prepare semi-&#13;
annual reports (para. 4.29).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
4.7   IDA  Because of the sectoral nature of IDA's support and the decentralization of the proposed&#13;
activities, IDA supervision will draw on Resident Mission assistance, particularly to: (a) foster the SIP&#13;
approach; (b) maintain close coordination with other donors; (c) carry out periodic field visits to the project&#13;
zone; and (d) facilitate communications with Headquarters and ensure smooth project implementation. To&#13;
the extent feasible, IDA's supervision from Headquarters will draw on the various expertise necessary to&#13;
monitor sector reforms. These missions will draw, inter alia, on the semiannual progress reports to provide&#13;
the basis for the issues to be discussed in the field.&#13;
4.8    The details of the Bank's supervision plan are provided in Annex 9. Two supervision missions per&#13;
year will be required: (a) early in the calendar year to inter alia evaluate implementation of the program,&#13;
conduct the annual review of project progress during the previous year, and examine the annual audit of the&#13;
project's accounts; and (b) late in the calendar year to review the proposed annual programs and budgets for&#13;
the following year. At least one of these missions will coincide with a meeting at the DDS and, on&#13;
occasion, at the district level. All partners in the sector (donors, NGOs, beneficiaries, etc.) will be involved&#13;
in these reviews.&#13;
4.9    Mid-term Review. Assurances were obtained from Government at negotiations that a mid-term&#13;
review (MTR) would be carried out to monitor progress of project implementation. As in the case for the&#13;
Annual Reviews (para. 3.27), four weeks prior to the mid-term review workshop, the Government will&#13;
submit to IDA for its review and comments a report that would evaluate past performance according to&#13;
agreed indicators and that would also include key forward-looking elements. In addition, this report would&#13;
also include assessments of: (a) the effectiveness of small-scale district contracting, judged against specific&#13;
performance indicators; (b) progress in the application of the health financing policy, as outlined in the PDS&#13;
and prospects for its finetuning; (c) relevance of health sector human resource strategy in light of reforms,&#13;
progress in its implementation, and prospects for its finetuning; (d) project's impact on health status in the&#13;
project area through an epidemiological survey; (e) project's performance and impact from the perspectives&#13;
of various key stakeholders, including beneficiaries, DDS staff, local authorities, and service providers&#13;
working in the project area; and (f) the sustainability of both Program and project, considering their&#13;
financial, operational, technical and administrative requirements. The MTR would be the responsibility of&#13;
the MOPH, which would coordinate and ensure its preparation, execution and follow up activities. It&#13;
would be participatory in its design. The results would be reviewed jointly by the Government and the&#13;
Bank, in full consultation with key stakeholders, and recommendations emanating from the MTR process&#13;
would be implemented promptly based on an agreed schedule.&#13;
E.     Gender Impact&#13;
4.10   Improvements in access to and the quality of family planning, health and nutrition services will&#13;
have an immediate positive impact on the life of women in a number of ways. Raising the Contraceptive&#13;
Prevalence Rate (CPR) will permit women to space births and thus alleviate the burden of maternal&#13;
depletion and continuous childbirth and the temptation to resort to unsafe abortions. Improved access&#13;
and outreach will also offer them the opportunity to deal with other obstetric problems and problems of&#13;
infertility or sub-fecundity which currently disrupt family life. The integration of family planning,&#13;
maternal and child health, and nutrition services will offer protection to mother and child and lay a solid&#13;
foundation for healthy growth of newborns and the welfare of their mothers. Effective management and&#13;
referral of high-risk pregnancies and complications at delivery would save women's lives and offer them&#13;
a better chance of bringing up healthy children. Systematic monitoring of the nutrition of women will&#13;
reduce the current high rate of anemia among pregnant women and reduce the incidence of low birth&#13;
weight. Such improvements will free women's resources and enable them to pursue economic and social&#13;
activities that fully integrate them into development activities and, as such, complement the recently&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
approved IDA investment in primary education, which supports national strategy to increase school&#13;
enrollment for girls. Finally, efforts to encourage and formalize the participation of women in the&#13;
management and implementation of health programs should expand their opportunities to improve their&#13;
own health status and that of their children.&#13;
F.     Environmental Impact&#13;
4.11    The project will have a positive environmental impact through activities promoting human and&#13;
household waste disposal and sanitation. The health promotion activities by the health district teams,&#13;
local partners, and community management comittees will create greater community awareness of the&#13;
measures needed to protect the environment and keep public places (health facilities, schools, and&#13;
markets) clean and provided with basic sanitation facilities. In-service programs under the project will&#13;
include training of clinical staff in proper procedures for handling and disposing of blood products,&#13;
needles and other hazardous materials and in mobilizing communities to improve the environment for&#13;
better health. The project will also provide safe water supplies in all health facilities that it covers.&#13;
G.    Procurement Arrangements&#13;
4.12   Table 4.1 below summarizes the estimated program cost by expenditures and the proposed&#13;
methods of procurement. A Country Procurement Assessment Report was completed in October 1985.&#13;
At that time, the laws and regulations which had been enacted over the last four decades, remained&#13;
somewhat outdated and sometimes contradictory. With IDA's assistance (under the Public Enterprise&#13;
Insitutional Development Project, Cr. 1838-NIR), the Government prepared new comprehensive&#13;
procurement regulations and, in April 1989, promulgated a new public procurement code. Article 5 of&#13;
the procurement code, allow IDA's procedures to take precedence. In order for National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) procedures to be acceptable to IDA, the credit document should include a waiver of the&#13;
regulation that grants preference to local contractors and suppliers. NCB procedures will provide for the&#13;
following elements: (a) permit participation of foreign bidders if they wish to participate; (b) explicit&#13;
statement to bidders of the evaluation and award criteria; (c) local advertising with public bid opening;&#13;
(d) award to lowest evaluated bidder.  All works, goods and services financed under the IDA credit&#13;
would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines and standard bidding documents for Intemational&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) and for Consultant Services (Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits, January 1995, and Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency, August 1981).&#13;

rehabilitation (district hospitals and CHD) estimated at more than US$200,000 per contract would be&#13;
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
guidelines. The extension of HD and rehabilitation of CHD would be grouped into one package of&#13;
several lots and bidder will be allowed to bid for one, two ...., or all lots. Contracts for construction and&#13;
rehabilitation estimated at less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of US$11.6&#13;

will provide for the fencing of all CSIs constructed and/or rehabilitated under the project.&#13;
4.14   Goods. Goods financed by IDA under the project would include: essential drugs, office&#13;
furniture and equipment, communication and small medical apparatus, medical equipment and supplies,&#13;
vehicles, documentation, and training materials.&#13;
(a)  Goods. Goods that can be grouped into packages of at least US$100,000 each would be&#13;
procured through ICB using Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the Procurement of Goods, January&#13;
1995 (Details on ICB for essential drugs and disposable medical supplies are shown in para. 4.14[b].).&#13;
Goods which can be competitively procured nationally and which cannot be grouped into packages of at&#13;
least US$100,000 equivalent each would be procured through NCR under procedures acceptable to IDA,&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million equivalent. Small items and goods which cannot be&#13;
grouped into bid packages of at least US$50,000 equivalent will be procured on the basis of price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided that the aggregate amount of such&#13;
procurements does not exceed a total of US$0.3 million equivalent. For specialized software and&#13;
standardization of equipment, procurement would be needed under direct contracting up to an aggregate&#13;
of US$0.05 million equivalent.&#13;
(b)  Essential Drugs and Disposable Medical Supplies.  Essential generic drugs and&#13;
disposable medical supplies would be procured through ICB by the management unit (Cellule de&#13;
Medicaments Essentiels et Generiques) of the ONPPC established by the EDF. The procurement of&#13;
drugs would be on the basis of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the Procurement of&#13;
Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines, (September 1993), and the procurement of disposable medical supplies&#13;
would be based on the Bank's standard bidding documents for goods. The performance of the ONPPC&#13;
on procurement matters would be subject to periodic review by IDA. Essential drugs and disposable&#13;
medical supplies would correspond to the approved MOH's formulary for drugs and to pharmacopea&#13;
norms, for departmental and district hospitals and CSIs. A preferential margin of 15 percent or the&#13;
applicable customs duty, whichever is less, over the c.i.f. prices of competing goods would be given for&#13;
locally produced drugs in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for all ICB procurement. All bids&#13;
would be submitted on a c.i.f. basis for imported goods and on an ex-factory basis for locally&#13;
manufactured goods.&#13;
4.15   Consultant Services, Research and Studies. The total costs for consultant services, research and&#13;
studies is estimated at US$4.8 million equivalent. The majority of consultancy services required under&#13;
the project would be in large part for project implementation, supervision, management assistance,&#13;
training activities, surveys, research and studies, and architectural and engineering services. A concerted&#13;
effort will be made to identify and recruit national consultants, wherever possible, and it is expected that&#13;
a large share of contracts will in fact be awarded nationally. In the spirit of partnership (para. 3.31) and&#13;
based on proven experience in the field, sole source contracts (about 5 percent of the total amount) with&#13;
national training institutions such as Ecoles Nationales de Sante Publique (Zinder and Niamey) or&#13;
University of Niger would be drawn for carrying out key activities of the project such as national training&#13;
programs and operational research (the selection of the institution would be based on a capacity&#13;
assessment carried out by the MOPH). Contract arrangements would also be made with various partners&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
at the district level-to carry out services (small-scale) needed in the context of implementing the district&#13;
health development plans. Technical assistance will also be used in the development of a follow-on&#13;
operation. Details on consultancies will be included in the operational manual. Technical assistance is&#13;
itemized in Annex 10.&#13;
4.16    Training includes training abroad (US$0.2 million equivalent), and regional and national&#13;
training (US$2.6 million equivalent). Whenever appropriate, external training will take place in the&#13;
Africa region. Details on external and national training are provided in Annex 11. Plans for external&#13;
and local training needs will be discussed at each level of the health system during the periodic reviews.&#13;
Training to be financed by the IDA credit will be subject to its review on an annual basis. IDA and&#13;
MOPH have agreed to pursue in the context of these annual reviews, opportunities for strengthening&#13;
specialization training of Niger's Faculty of Health Sciences and thus minimize need for external&#13;
training.&#13;
4.17   Recurrent Costs, including consumables, communications and other administrative costs,&#13;
incremental contractual salaries (excluding civil servant salaries), field supervision and subsistence&#13;
allowances, building and vehicle/equipment operation and maintenance, will be procured and paid for&#13;
following regular Government procedures, acceptable to IDA. IDA's financing would be reduced from&#13;
90 percent to 80 percent after June 30, 1999.&#13;
4.18   Procurement Management and Coordination. An assessment of the country's capacity in&#13;
carrying out civil works management during project implementation was carried out during appraisal.&#13;
Based on its result, it has been agreed that for civil works associated with the construction and&#13;
rehabilitation of CSIs (I and 2), a contract would be drawn with an engineering management firm such&#13;
as Nigetip to prepare bidding documents, launch of tenders, and supervise construction/rehabilitation&#13;
sites. For civil works associated with the extension and rehabilitation of HD and CHD to be procured&#13;
under ICB, it was agreed that a qualified architectural and engineering firm would be recruited to carry&#13;
out architectural and engineering studies under the direct control of the MOPH. Details on the civil work&#13;
program will be included in the Project Operational Manual.  Except for the construction and&#13;
rehabilitation of CSIs, the Division of Materials of the DAF/M will have the responsibility for managing&#13;
and monitoring all procurement activities of the program financed by IDA. The procurement will be&#13;
carried out by staff of the Division of Materials assisted before and during project implementation by a&#13;
locally recruited procurement specialist with relevant experience in externally funded projects. In&#13;
addition to this assistance, relevant MOPH staff will receive adequate training as part of pre-project&#13;
activity in procurement for IDA-financed projects. Although the DAF/M Director will be responsible for&#13;
the overall administrative and contractual arrangements of the program, he will liaise closely with the&#13;
Division of Materials head on all matters related to the preparation, implementation and monitoring of&#13;
work plans for the smooth execution of procurement of all works, goods, and services, including the&#13;
preparation of bidding documents and launching of tenders. In some cases, the DAF/M will also carry&#13;
out evaluation (based on contract amount), and report the results to the Government and to IDA for&#13;
review. In addition, adequate records on procurement progress, (including staff reports on site visits, the&#13;
timing of works and goods procurement; and compliance with agreed methods of procurement) will be&#13;
maintained by the DAF/M. These data will be used in MOPH's program monitoring system. A schedule&#13;
for key procurement steps, which was discussed and agreed upon during negotiations will be included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
4.19   Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts for works and goods above thresholds of US$200,000&#13;
and US$100,000 equivalent, respectively, would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. Prior IDA&#13;
review would also apply to consultant services and training contracts estimated to cost more than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. Prior review would apply below these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
thresholds for terms of reference, single-source hiring of firms, amendments of contracts raising the&#13;
contract value to US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals. Post-review of&#13;
awarded contracts below the prior review thresholds would apply to over 50 percent (about US$20.0&#13;
million equivalent) of these contracts. A timetable for the preparation of bidding documents for works,&#13;
goods, and services as part of project preparation activity has been agreed upon and will be included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
4.20   Assurance was obtained during negotiations that procurement of goods, works and consultants'&#13;
services required for the program and to be financed out of the proceeds of the credit will take place in&#13;
accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA. Procurement information will be collected and recorded&#13;
as follows: (a) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (b) comprehensive&#13;
semi-annual reports to IDA by the Borrower, indicating: (i) revised cost estimates for individual&#13;
contracts and the total project, including best estimates of allowances for physical and price&#13;
contingencies; (ii) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award,&#13;
and completion time for individual contracts; (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods&#13;
of procurement; and (iv) a project final report prepared within the three months of the credit's closing&#13;
date.&#13;
H.    Disbursement&#13;
4.21   The project, which supports the PDS, is expected to be completed within a five-year period by&#13;
December 31, 2001 with a credit closing date of June 30, 2002. The disbursement schedule takes into&#13;
account: (a) the considerable amount of time and resources invested by the MOPH in preparing and&#13;
planning the PDS; (b) the level of support received from all parts of the government to the PDS and as&#13;
subscribed in the Policy Framework Paper (PFP); (c) the selection of the health sector as a first step&#13;
towards implementing Government's policy of decentralization; (d) the high degree of ownership and&#13;
commitment towards the program at all levels of government (central, departmental and district levels);&#13;
and (e) the strengthening of MOPH capacity by adding an adequate number of qualified and trained staff&#13;
in the Directorates of Studies and Planning (DEP) and Financial Affairs and Materials (DAF/M) as well&#13;
as the strengthening of the capacity at the departmental and district levels in management, monitoring,&#13;
supervision, evaluation and control of activities. The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex&#13;
12.&#13;
4.22   Table 4.2 gives the categories and amounts to be financed out of the IDA credit, and the&#13;
percentage to be financed in each category.&#13;

4.23    Conditions of Disbursements. The conditions of disbursements are as follows: (a) categories&#13;
l(a) and 2(a) (construction and equipment of new facilities): the Government will provide a plan,&#13;
referred to in Annex 3 of the statement of sector development policy, satisfactory to IDA, for&#13;
redeployment, retraining and recruitment of health sector staff in order to ensure that upgraded and new&#13;
health facilities will be sufficiently staffed and operational in line with MOPH staffing norms and in full&#13;
respect of the PFP; (b) category 3 (drugs): the Government will adopt a decret d'application acceptable&#13;
to IDA, for Law No. 95-014 of July 3, 1995, on cost recovery.&#13;
4.24    Disbursement and withdrawal procedures are detailed in The World Bank Disbursement&#13;
Handbook (1992). All disbursements are subject to the conditions of the Development Credit Agreement&#13;
and the procedures defined in the Disbursement Letter. The Operational Manual will further outline the&#13;
role and responsibilities of the staff of the Division of Financial Affairs of the DAF/M with regard to&#13;
disbursement/payment and financial accounting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
4.25   Special Account. To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal&#13;
applications, a Special Account will be opened in FCFA in a commercial bank in terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation amounts to FCFA 750 million and covers about four&#13;
months of eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, an amount of FCFA 375 million representing 50&#13;
percent of the authorized allocation will be deposited in the Special Account. The remaining balance&#13;
will be made available when the total amount withdrawn from the credit account and/or special&#13;
commitments issued amounts to the equivalent of US$20 million. The Special Account will be used for&#13;
all payments below US$300,000 equivalent.  Replenishments will be submitted monthly.  All&#13;
replenishments should be fully documented except for: (a) contracts of less than US$200,000 equivalent&#13;
for civil works and US$100,000 for goods; (b) contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent for&#13;
consulting services - firms, and US$50,000 equivalent for consultants services - individuals; and (c)&#13;
training and operating costs, which will be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained for review by periodic Bank supervision&#13;
missions and external auditors.&#13;
4.26   Government Financing.  Government financial contribution to the health sector would be&#13;
monitored through the accounting and monitoring system to be established with the assistance of an&#13;
auditor and the MFP. The MFP will be required to make quarterly allocations to the MOPH on the basis&#13;
of an agreed budget for the program, proposed by Government, and accepted by IDA one month before&#13;
the beginning of each fiscal year. As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government will open a&#13;
Project Account and deposit an initial amount of 50 million CFAF (equivalent to the first year of&#13;
counterpart expenditures). Assurance was received at negotiations that this project account will be&#13;
maintained during project implementation. Improvements to MOPH's accounting system would also be&#13;
undertaken in the context of the project's management strengthening efforts.&#13;
I.    Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting&#13;
4.27   Overall responsibility for the program's financial management would rest with the Division of&#13;
Financial Affairs at the DAF/M. Vouchers and checks for payment will be signed by the financial&#13;
controller and transmitted to the Project Coordinator (DEP) for processing through the DAF/M Director.&#13;
Project accounts, as well as the project special account and disbursements under SOEs, will be audited&#13;
annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA whose selection will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness. Also, as a condition of effectiveness, the Government will furnish evidence satisfactory&#13;
to IDA that a computerized accounting and financial management system for the implementation of the&#13;
project has been established in the DAF/M and in the DDS within the project area, and that qualified and&#13;
experienced accountants have been appointed. Establishment of such an accounting system will include&#13;
the preparation of an accounting procedures manual, and training of accountants.&#13;
4.28   Audited accounts and reports will be submitted to the MOPH, MFP and IDA not later than six&#13;
months after the end of each fiscal year. The auditor would establish a "Long Form Report" as described&#13;
in the Bank's Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Project Financed by the World Bank,&#13;
March 1982. Audit on project expenditures would include an examination of the substantiating&#13;
documentation and a verification that: (a) project accounts permnit identification of all receipt and&#13;
payments; (b) goods have been received or work performed; (c) payments have been made; (d) all&#13;
expenditures have been legitimate; and (e) the special account has been used appropriately; along with an&#13;
opinion on the reliability of the SOE procedures and on whether the goods, works, and services acquired&#13;
under the project were being utilized in accordance with its objectives. The auditors would also include&#13;
the management report revealing possible shortcomings in staffing and systems, and evaluate the&#13;
accounting system and efficiency of the internal control procedures. There is no outstanding audit for&#13;
the First Health Project (Cr. 1668-NIR, closed June 30, 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
4.29   Reporting. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will: (a) submit to IDA&#13;
for its review and comments, semi-annual progress reports on the status of the project; and (b) prepare&#13;
and submit to IDA, on the basis of guidelines satisfactory to IDA a completion report that would cover,&#13;
inter alia, the execution of the operation, its costs and benefits, the performance of the Government and&#13;
the Bank, and a plan to ensure Program sustainability.&#13;
V. BENEFT&amp;S AND RISKS&#13;
A.    Benefits&#13;
5.1   IDA's intervention will provide some one million people with improved access to preventive and&#13;
curative care. Increased vaccination coverage of children and availability of quality pre- and post-natal&#13;
care and family planing services would contribute to efforts to reduce infant and maternal mortality and&#13;
to efforts to increase contraceptive prevalence. The project's support of STD/AIDS activities would also&#13;
reinforce the GON's efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS and reduce STD transmission. In addition,&#13;
community participation in the management and financing of health services would enhance people's&#13;
awareness of health issues, render the health system more accountable to the clients it is meant to serve,&#13;
and facilitate the adoption of more advanced policy reforms. The project would also improve the&#13;
effectiveness and efficiency of the national health system through: improved planning of health&#13;
interventions, more efficient management of resources, fuller utilization of non-governmental capacity.&#13;
In addition, more efficient utilization of the various referral levels of the health system and the&#13;
generalization of the use of generic drugs would together help contain costs of health services. A more&#13;
detailed assessment of Program and project benefits is presented in the economic analysis in Annex 7.&#13;
B.    Risks&#13;
5.2   The most prominent among the country risks is the tenuous macroeconomic situation, which puts&#13;
into question Niger's ability to provide its counterpart financing of the Program. Implementation of the&#13;
Program in the North risks being delayed if the peace agreement with the Tuaregs is not implemented.&#13;
Tlhe most significant institutional risk is Government commitmnent and capacity to decentralize.&#13;
Decentralization is one of Niger's stated priorities, albeit with uncertain implementation schedule.&#13;
Commitment within and outside MOPH, capacity, mechanisms, and the pace of decentralization are not,&#13;
however, fully evident. The various dimensions of decentralization (political, administrative and&#13;
operational) will most likely take place slowly, and at various paces. While establishment of health&#13;
districts will be initiated at the Program's outset, its success will be subject to risks associated with&#13;
building sufficient administrative and financial capacity at the decentralized levels -- tasks associated&#13;
with the public sector management reforms, not yet in place. Given that PDS strategy is anchored in&#13;
economic analyses and lessons of experience contained in WDR '93 and BHA technical risks are likely to&#13;
be small, and related to adaptation of experience and lessons to the Nigerien context. There is a risk that&#13;
cost recovery will limit or prohibit utilization of services by the poorest and most vulnerable groups.&#13;
Efforts to strengthen partnerships in health is risky in that it is a new approach, but is one well worth&#13;
pursuing.&#13;
VI.A         FfARE M&#13;
6.1    During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it would:&#13;
(a)    prepare and adopt a pricing mechanism for essential generic drugs in the private and&#13;
public sectors by March 31, 1998 (para. 3.12);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
(b)    not later than three months following Effective Date it will introduce into Parliament: (i)&#13;
a draft pharmaceutical law, satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.16); and (ii) a law that would demonopolize&#13;
ONPPC (paras. 3.17);&#13;
(c)    adopt no later than December 31, 1997 a new legal status for ONPPC's essential drugs&#13;
procurement unit, satisfactory to IDA, that would accord it sufficient managerial and financial autonomy&#13;
(para. 3.17);&#13;
(d)    present a new draft legal status for following functions of ONPPC--quality control and&#13;
laborator, production, and acquisition, distribution and retailing--at the time of the mid-term review, and&#13;
adopt no later than June 30, 2000 the final versions of the legal status, satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.17);&#13;
(e)    establish district health teams in the project area no later than 12 months after credit&#13;
effectiveness, and that districts will undertake, on a quarterly basis, as soon as district health teams have&#13;
been established, participatory evaluations of performance in implementing district plans, with a view to&#13;
reviewing and refining programs, financing plans and budget allocations in light of experience and&#13;
accomplishments. These evaluations will be submitted to the DDS, which will consolidate them at the&#13;
departmental level (para. 3.22);&#13;
(f)    carry out on a semi-annual basis participatory evaluations of departmental performance&#13;
in implementing the PDS. On the basis of program performance and lessons learned, programs,&#13;
financing plans and budget allocations will be reviewed and revised, and submitted to MOPH central&#13;
level for review and consolidation (para. 3.23);&#13;
(g)    undertake no later than April 30 of each year annual reviews of Program and project&#13;
performnance in the implementation of the PDS and revision of the following year's plan in light of&#13;
experience gained, lessons learned and emerging opportunities and constraints (para. 3.27);&#13;
(h)    at least four weeks prior to the Annual Review of Program Performance MOPH, submit&#13;
to IDA for its review and to other donors an annual sector performance report, drawing on reviews and&#13;
reports carrried out at the district and departmental levels, and encompassing both a retrospective of the&#13;
past year's performance and forward-looking elements. This report would provide the basis for&#13;
discussions at the Annual Review (para. 3.27);&#13;
(i)    implement plans and decisions agreed to during the Annual Reviews and take any&#13;
corrective action deemed necessary to remedy constraints identified during the Review or any other&#13;
measures to facilitate achievement of Program objectives (para. 3.27);&#13;
(j)    undertake by the time of the mid-term review of the project an evaluation of community&#13;
participation experience culminating in the elaboration of a draft legal framework for community&#13;
participation in health. This evaluation and draft legal framework would be discussed and reviewed at&#13;
the mid-term review and the legal framework introduced into Parliament for its adoption after the mid-&#13;
term review workshop (para. 3.30);&#13;
(k)    maintain until project completion the long-term national adviser to the MOPH on sector&#13;
reform and PDS implementation with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.4);&#13;
(1)    designate DDS staff to act as departmental Project Coordinators at all times until&#13;
completion of the project with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA and that the staff of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
three DDS would include at all times a financial specialist with qualifications and experience acceptable&#13;
to IDA (para. 4.4);&#13;
(m)   carry out in consultation with IDA a mid-term review of the progress made in carrying&#13;
out the project, which would include an epidemiological survey and a beneficiary assessment (para. 4.9);&#13;
(n)    maintain a Project Account in a commercial bank satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.26); and&#13;
(o)    submit to IDA for its review and comments semi-annual progress reports on the status of&#13;
the project, and prepare and submit to IDA, on the basis of guidelines satisfactory to IDA, a completion&#13;
report, including a plan to ensure Program sustainability (4.29).&#13;
6.2    As conditions of Board Presentation, the Government: (a) submitted to IDA the final, signed&#13;
statement of health sector policy, including the three annexes (para. 2.27); and (b) recruited a long-term&#13;
national adviser to MOPH on sector reform and PDS implementation with qualifications and experience&#13;
satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.4).&#13;
6.3    As conditions of effectiveness, the Government would have:&#13;
(a)    adopted a Project Operational Manual, including, inter alia, a work program for the first&#13;
twelve months period after the Effective Date, all satisfactory to IDA (para.4.4);&#13;
(b)    appointed in each of the three DDS (Diffa, Tillaberi, and Zinder), a departmental project&#13;
coordinator with skills and experience satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.4); and&#13;
(c)    opened a Project Account and deposited a sum equivalent to the first year of counterpart&#13;
expenditures (50 million CFAF) (para. 4.26).&#13;
(d)    furnished evidence, satisfactory to IDA, that a computerized accounting and financial&#13;
management system for the implementation of the Project has been established in the DAF/M, and in the&#13;
DDS of Diffa, Tillaberi, and Zinder, and that qualified and experienced accountants have been appointed&#13;
(paras. 4.27); and&#13;
(e)    selected project auditors under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.27).&#13;
6.4    The following will be conditions of disbursement:&#13;
(a)    construction and equipment of new health facilities: the Government will provide a plan,&#13;
referred to in Annex 3 of the statement of sector development policy, satisfactory to IDA, for&#13;
redeployment, retraining and recruitment of health sector staff in order to ensure that upgraded and new&#13;
health facilities will be sufficiently staffed and operational in line with MOPH staffing norms, and in full&#13;
respect of the PFP (para. 3.9 and 4.23); and&#13;
(b)    drugs: the Govermment will adopt a decret d'application acceptable to IDA, for Law No.&#13;
95-014 of July 3, 1995, on cost recovery (paras. 3.12 and 4.23).&#13;
6.6    Recommendation. Subject to agreement to the above, the proposed program will constitute a&#13;
suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$40.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Niger on standard IDA&#13;
terms with a maturity of 40 years.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF NIGER&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
MAJOR CAUSES OF MORBIDITY&#13;
La situation epidemiologique actuelle du Niger, se caracterise par une forte predominance des&#13;
maladies infectieuses et parasitaires. Les principales morbidites rapportees par les formations sanitaires sont&#13;
presentees dans le tableau 14.&#13;
Elles se resument comme suit:&#13;
* Le paludisme : demeure la premiere affection avec une incidence annuelle de 1170 cas pour 10.000&#13;
habitants. En effet, le paludisme sevit de facon end6mique, avec des variations saisonnieres. Des&#13;
phenomenes de chloroquino-resistance ont commence A apparaitre dans certaines regions (Gaya,&#13;
Tillaberi).&#13;
3  Les Infections Respiratoires Aigues : constituent la deuxieme morbidite chez les enfants de moins&#13;
de cinq ans.&#13;
* Les maladies diarrh6iques constituent la premiere morbidite chez les enfants de moins de 5 ans.&#13;
*  Les affections ophtalmologiques: une enquete nationale effectuee en 1989 (par le Programme&#13;
National de Lutte contre la Cecite) a determine le taux de Cecite au Niger A 2,2%. Elie depasse le&#13;
seuil etabli par l'OMS (0,5%). Les causes principales demeurent:&#13;
* les maladies conjonctivo-corn6ennes et carentielles pour 0,75%&#13;
*  les cataractes degeneratives et secondaires pour 0,6%&#13;
*  les glaucomes degeneratifs et secondaires pour 0,6%&#13;
*  les autres causes qu'elles soient traumatiques, h6reditaires ou indeterminees pour 0,3% des cas.&#13;
80% des affections oculaires cecitantes sont curables et/ou evitables.&#13;
*  Les affections dermatologiques: dominees par les infections bacteriennes et parasitaires (Impetigo,&#13;
Furoncle, Pyodermite, Gale..) constituent la cinquieme cause de morbidite dans la population.&#13;
*  Les affections gynico-obstitricales: 1'etat de sante du couple mere/enfant, constituant 70% de la&#13;
population, demeure preoccupant: La mortalite maternelle est de 7 pour mille. Elle est l'une des plus&#13;
elevees au monde. Sur une periode de 15 ans (1973-1988), 4 grandes etiologies ont ete degagees&#13;
representant au total 75% de deces maternels en milieu urbain:&#13;
* hemorragie de la delivrance 21 %&#13;
* ruptures uterines 20%&#13;
*  infections 18%&#13;
*  eclampsies 15 %&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
*  En zone rurale, les donnees sont incompletes. 11 a ete constate neanmoins que l'insuffisance de&#13;
consultations prenatales et les accouchements non assistes sont parmi les principaux facteurs qui font&#13;
courir sur la mere nigerienne de serieux risques de deces par hemorragie, ruptures uterines, infections&#13;
et eclampsies.&#13;
*  Les affections urinaires&#13;
* La rougeole est la premiere cause de deces des enfants de moins de 5 ans. Elle se remarque par des&#13;
epidemies saisonnieres, dont les plus importantes depuis 1981 etaient celles de 1984-85 et de 1990-&#13;
1991. La couverture vaccinale chez les enfants de moins de 24 mois n'est que de 27,8%.&#13;
* La meningite cerebro-spinale est frequente surtout pendant la saison seche lorsque souffle&#13;
I'harmattan, avec un taux de morbidite de I a 2%. L'6pidemie la plus importante depuis 1981 etait&#13;
celle de 1985-86.&#13;
*  La fievre jaune sevit de maniere endemique dans certains pays voisins, ce qui represente un risque&#13;
serieux d'eclosion des foyers epidemiques au Niger.&#13;
* Le cholera a une tendance endemo-epiddmique depuis 1984, et particulierement dans le sud du&#13;
departement de Maradi et le long du Goulbi de Maradi (frontiere avec le Nigeria).&#13;
*  La schistosomiase apparait avec un fort taux de prevalence de 40% a 70% dans certaines regions du&#13;
pays, notamment, le long du fleuve et autour des mares permanentes.&#13;
*  La lepre reste un fleau social et un probleme non negligeable de sante publique avec un taux de&#13;
prevalence de 1,0%o.&#13;
*  La dracunculose  (ver de Guinee) s6vit de maniere endemique dans certaines regions,&#13;
particuli6rement le long du fleuve et au sud du pays, elle represente un important probleme de sant6&#13;
publique a cause de son aspect handicapant. Dans les 5 departements identifies comme zones&#13;
endemiques lors de 1'enquete nationale sur le ver de Guin6e realisee en 1991, 32.829 cas ont 6t6&#13;
recenses. La plupart des cas (64%) se trouvent dans le departement de Zinder. L'arrondissement de&#13;
Mirriah, departement de Zinder, est le plus touche du pays avec 457 villages endemiques totalisant&#13;
17.763 cas.&#13;
*  Les maladies sexuellement transmissibles (MST) sont en progression. Elles occupent le premier&#13;
rang de la morbidite dans la population adulte (15 ans et plus), et dans le d6partement de Diffa, le&#13;
8eme au niveau national. Elles affectent 30% des femmes enceintes en milieu urbain, et on estime la&#13;
pr6valence globale a 300.000 cas par an dans le pays. Parmi les cas notifi6s, 11 % se trouvent chez les&#13;
personnes de moins de 15 ans.&#13;
*  L'importance de la poliomy6lite est tres probablement sous estimee dans les formations sanitaires, vu&#13;
la difficulte de diagnostic au debut de la maladie. Peu de cas ont ete enregistres en 1990 et 1991 (39 et&#13;
57 respectivement). Pourtant la couverture vaccinale pour la poliomyelite est tres basse, de 20,1 %&#13;
chez les enfants de 12 a 23 mois en 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
*  Le syndrome d'immuno-deficience acquise (SIDA): Les premiers cas de SIDA au Niger ont ete&#13;
depistes en 1987. De 1987 a 1992, 809 cas de SIDA ont et notifies pour 1'ensemble des formations&#13;
sanitaires. Ce norme est passe a 921 cas le 30 juin 1993. Une recente enquete epidemiologique&#13;
(MSP/BANQUE MONDIALE, Mai-Juin 1993) a Niamey a reve1l les taux de seroprevalence&#13;
suivants: 1,3% chez les femmes enceintes; 15,4% cliez les prostituees; 3,0% chez les routiers; 6,0%&#13;
chez les porteurs de MST. II existe au Niger les deux virus VIH 1 (93%) et VIH 2. Ces donn&amp;es nous&#13;
permettent d'estimer a environ 52.000 le nombre de s6ropositifs dans le pays. Si la transmission n'est&#13;
pas reduite nous auront 90.000 seropositifs en 1998 et pres de 6.000 orphelins de mere pour cause du&#13;
SIDA. L'importance de la migration vers les pays c6tiers a haute prevalence et le multipartenariat&#13;
sexuel favorisent la transmission du virus.&#13;
* La tuberculose reste un problrme majeur au Niger. Meme si le nombre de cas rapporte est&#13;
relativement bas, le Centre National Antituberculeux estime une incidence annuelle (nombre de&#13;
nouveaux cas par an) de 1,5 pour mille. Avec la croissance du SIDA/VIH la tuberculose pourrait&#13;
connaitre une recrudescence.&#13;
*  La malnutrition protemo-energetique, I'anemie nutritionnelle et la carence en vitamine A, sont&#13;
des problemes preoccupants de sante publique. Pres de 20% de nouveau-nes ont un poids a la&#13;
naissance inferieur a 2,5 kg. L'enquete sur la morbidite et la mortalite realis6e en 1985 (periode de&#13;
grande secheresse) faisait etat de taux de prevalence de malnutrition tres eleves, 24,9% des enfants de&#13;
6 a 59 mois subissait une malnutrition aigue t &lt; -2 E.T. poids/taille). Une enquete nationale menee en&#13;
1992 a demontre un taux de malnutrition aigue de 16,9% chez ce meme groupe. Les tranches d'age les&#13;
plus touchees sont les enfants de 6 a 23 mois (periode d'introduction des aliments solides et de&#13;
sevrage). II existe de poches d'endemie de goitre, notamment dans les departements de Dosso,&#13;
Tillaberi et Maradi.&#13;
3  La mortalite infanto-juvelule (&lt; 5 ans) est tine des plus elevee de l'Afrique. L'enquete&#13;
demographique et de sante au Niger en 1992 (EDSNIDHS) I'a estimee a 318 pour mille pour les&#13;
quatre annees avant 1'enquete, soit presqu'un enfant sur trois meurt avant l'age de cinq ans (taux de&#13;
mortalite infantile 123 pour mille, mortalite juvenile - I a 4 ans - 223 pour mille). Les principales&#13;
causes de mortalite pour les enfants de moins de 5 ans sont, par ordre d ' importance, la rougeole, le&#13;
paludisme , les diarrhees , la malnutrition et les pneumopathies. Pour la meme tranche d'age, les&#13;
causes de morbidite les plus frequentes concernent les affections respiratoires, le paludisme, les&#13;
diarrhees, et les affections ophtalmologiques.&#13;
*  La couverture vaccinale contre le tetanos pour les femmes enceintes est tres basse, en 1992, 23,4%&#13;
des femmes avaient requs au moins une injection antitetanique lors de la derniere grossesse. La meme&#13;
annee, la couverture pour toutes les maladies cibles du PEV est tres faible: 17,4% des enfants de 12 a&#13;
23 mois (si l'on y ajoute le vaccin contre la fievre jaune. Ia couverture n'est que de 14,4%).&#13;
*  L'EDSN 1992 a fait ressortir egalement une prevalence contraceptive modeme tres basse, a peine&#13;
2,3%.&#13;
*  Au Niger, 32,1 % de la population vit dans un rayon de 5 km d'une formation sanitaire fixe, chiffre&#13;
retenu pour representer la couverture sanitaire (cf. Tableaux en annexe).&#13;

ECI LARATION DE POLITIQUE SECTORIELLE DE SANTE&#13;
La presente declaration a pour objet d'exposer la politique de sante du Gouvernement de&#13;
la Ripublique du Niger qui sert de cadre au de'veloppement du secteur sanitaire.&#13;
1. LA SITUATION SANITAIRE&#13;
Au lendemain des independances la polidque sanitaire du Niger itait axec essentielaement&#13;
sur la me'decine curative individueUe. Les cIements essentiels de cette politique reposaient&#13;
sur la gratuite des soins, la faible paricipation des communautis t la gestion at au&#13;
financement des actions qui interessent kur sante, la pridominance de la medecine&#13;
curative et la concentration des infrastructures sanitaires dans lks grandes viles et Ics&#13;
grandes agglomirutions.&#13;
Par la suite las diffirents plans de diveloppement socio-iconomiques preconisaient une&#13;
approcha de poligique sanitaire consiquente, c'est a dire, une midecina dicentralise&#13;
intigrant l'aspect curatif et priventif, m!ai las conditions itakent loin d'etre riunias pour&#13;
atteindre les objectifs visis.&#13;
A pardr de 19741976 l'accent a ete mis sur une medecine de masse, preventive et mobile&#13;
intigrant de facon beaucoup plus claire l'aspect curati des soins. L'option fondamentaka&#13;
itait que la Niger devrait pratiquer une midecine globak et intOgrie, coordonnant Las&#13;
activitis priventives, iducatives, curaives et promotionneUes pour toutes ks communautis&#13;
at visant l'auto-suffisance sanitaire. Pour atteindre ct ideal, la politique de l'auto-&#13;
tncadrement sanitaire a iti developpe'c avec la formation des agents de sante' viUlageois sur&#13;
tout k territoire national dans k cadre du Projet Amiioaion de la Santc Rurale (1980-&#13;
1986).&#13;
Pour renforcer l'option fondamentalk de cette politique sanitaire qui se veut intigrie avec&#13;
la plcine paticipation de la communauti, la Niger a souscrit a plusieurs diclarations&#13;
rigionaks at internationales dont cellc d'Alma-Ata en 1978 oiu la politique des Souts de&#13;
Santc Prinaires (SSP) a iti initiee.&#13;
Le constat qui se digage apres plusieurs annies de mise en oeuvre de ces poliiques st:&#13;
*     Un taux pafliculierement ikvi de la moaati materneUa, infantile at infanto-&#13;
juvc'nik.&#13;
*     Une irrigulaoiti dans la disponibiliti des midicaments.&#13;
*     Un faibk taux de la couvefture sanitaire risultant d'une insufisanoc  de&#13;
l'occessibilit des populaions ax service de santc at d'une mauvaise utilizion d&#13;
ces derniers.&#13;
*     Un faible taux de couverlure vaccinale notamment pour Las enfants at ks femnus&#13;
en dge de procrier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 5 of 13&#13;
*     Une inadequation entre I'accroissement demographique et les ressources mises' &amp; la&#13;
disposition du secteur sanitaire.&#13;
*     Une grande disparite dans la repanition des ressources sanitaires entre zones&#13;
rurales et urbaines, entre activitis curatives et prfventives et entre secteur&#13;
hospitalier it non hospitalier.&#13;
*     Une insalubrite croissante du milieu&#13;
*     Une insuffisance de la sensibilisation de la popuation sur les problemes de santc.&#13;
*     Un iquilibre alimentaire de plus en plus fragile ayant des consequences sur l'eat&#13;
nutritionnel des groupes vulnerables ; particulierement les enfants en bas age, les&#13;
femmes allaitantes et lasfemmes enceintes.&#13;
- *   Une mauvaise gestion des services de sante et une insuffisance de la coordiation&#13;
de la participation communautaire et des autres aides exterieures.&#13;
* JUne insuffisance, voire absence de mecanisme intra et inter-sectoriels de&#13;
coordination des actions de santi pour une bonne intigration et gestion des&#13;
programmes sanitaires.&#13;
Au regard de ces constats, un changementfondamental s'impose qfln d'accilrer la misc&#13;
en oeuvre de la stratigic des soins primaires- et de l'objectif universel de la santi pour tous&#13;
d'ici l'an 2000 d'une part, de la prockmation contenue dans la constitution du 26&#13;
dicembre 1992 qui est de garantir k droit &amp; la santi a tous las citoyens nigiriens d'autre&#13;
pail.&#13;
HI. ORIENTATIUN&#13;
Pour concritiser cette option, le gouvernement dicide de pnviligicr la prevention &amp; trmvers&#13;
les actions d'infonmation et de sensibilisation des populations, Ik renforcement de l'hygicne&#13;
du milieu, l'accroissement du taux de couveiture vaccinale, la r'onientation des&#13;
investissements en vue d'une meilkure couveiture sanitaire du pays. Une attention&#13;
particuli2re sera podite aux actions de protection et de sauvegarde de la mire et de l'enfant&#13;
notamment dans Ik cadre d'une poitique approprile de planfication des naissances. La&#13;
politique de medicaments consistera h mettrc a la disposition des populations des&#13;
medicaments essentiels ginieiques de bonne qualit des prix accessibles; a amrliorer Is&#13;
outils de production et la poitique d'approvisionnemnent. Dans Ik cadre de cette politique,&#13;
ks couches sociaks ks plus difavorisies binificieront des effets de l'organisation de la&#13;
solidaiti nationalk dont l'object(f scra un recouvremcnt pariel et iquitable des cofts de&#13;
santi. Le programme deformation des agents de santE va Ire renaforcd ct tenir compte des&#13;
besoins riels. Le programme d'investissements dans lcs infrastructures sanitaires sera&#13;
poursuivi et diveloppipour assurer une meilleure dicentralisation et un rapprochement des&#13;
populations des centres de santi.&#13;

-   Ic niveau central chargc de l'appui stratdgique,&#13;
- Ie niveau intermc'diairc (departement) responsable de l'appui technique,&#13;
-   et le niveau district (arrondissement et commune) correspondant au soutien&#13;
opirationnel.&#13;
Cece approche est area sur le diveloppement effectif du district dont I'opinztionnaisation&#13;
nicessitera l'appui des deux (2) niveaux et la pleine panpon communautaire.&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 7 of 13&#13;
La pariicipation des populations devra itre organisie et reglementee et visera l'implication&#13;
des populations dans la gestion des services de santi et la prise de dicision concernant&#13;
leurs problkmes de sante dans l'optique d'une auto-responsabilisation.&#13;
2. Accroissement de la disoonibiliti des ressources&#13;
L'accroissement de la disponibiliti des ressources du secteur sante dipendra avant tout&#13;
d'une utilisation rationnele des ressources (humaines, mateinelles et financiares)&#13;
existantes, d'un apport substantiel de la part de la population, de l'itat et des autres&#13;
partenaires, de la mise en place de micanismes de gestion appropriis et d'une structure&#13;
efficace d'inspection et controle de la gestion des e'quipement et des moyens.&#13;
S'agissant des ressources humaines, la situation se caracterise non seulement par une&#13;
insuffisance globale, mais igalement une formation inadaptie aux besoins de la politique&#13;
des soins de santd prunaires; une grande mobiliti due aux affectations qui entrave la&#13;
continuite' des actions entreprises et une mauvaise repartition au detnment des zones&#13;
!          rurales oiu vivent les 80% de la population. C'est ainsi qu'en 1994, 33% des medecins et&#13;
40% des sage-femmes etaient concentris dans la seule ville de Niamey.&#13;
ni s'avre nicessaire de proceder a un rediploiement du personnel; au besoin, en recourant&#13;
i des mithodes incitaives en attendant l'avenement d'une politique de rigionalisation des&#13;
postes budgLtaires dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre de la poiitique de dicentralisation.&#13;
Concernant les midicaments ils se prisentent giniralement sousforme de spicialitis sur&#13;
ie marchi t un cout inabordable pour la majoriti de la population. De plus la faible&#13;
couverture pharmaceutique at l'irrigularila de l'approvisionnement dues aux faibles&#13;
capacitis de gestion de L'O.N.P.P.C. riduisent leur disponibilite. n s'agirande reduire les&#13;
couits des midicaments pour les rendre accessibles au pouvoir d'achat des populations en&#13;
amiliorant la poltique d'approvisionnement et en utilisant des midicaments essentiels&#13;
gineriques tout en veiUant a la qualiti e a la formation du personnel pour garantir la&#13;
rationalisation de la prescription.&#13;
Dans k domaine du materiel, l'iquiti sera recherchee dans la ripanlition &amp; travers&#13;
l'utiUsation de criteres adiquats et la difinition de nornes et quotas en fonction du statut&#13;
des formations stnitazres.&#13;
Des plans de diveloppement sanitaires seront ilaboris par districts, comme outil de gestion&#13;
et de rifirence pour les diffirents paflenaires. Leur mise en oeuvre se fera annueUement&#13;
, travers des plans d'action.&#13;
La participation communautaire aux couts des soins de santd organisie sous forme de&#13;
recouvrement partiel des co&amp;ts, vise l'accroissement des ressources sanitaires et constitue&#13;
une condition sine qua non de la viabilite du systame de sante.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;

3. Extension de la couverture sanitaire&#13;
Un accent parriculier sera mis sur l'extension geographique de la couverture sanitaire.&#13;
Cette extension permnettr  d'accroitre ipso facto l'accessibilite de la population aux&#13;
diffirentes structures de prestation. La prioriti sera accordie aux infrastructures du district&#13;
sanitaire qui s'adressent a la majorite de la population.Le renforcement du secteur&#13;
hospitalier et l'appoirt du secteur privi seront pris en considiration.&#13;
La couverture actuelle est de l'ordre de 32%. L'objectif visi est d'atteindre 45% dans un&#13;
rayon de 5 kIn d'une formation sanitaire d'ici I'an 2 000. Pour cefaire il convient de crier&#13;
de nouveUes infrastructures, de rihabiliter ceUles qui existent, d'amnliorer k cadre de&#13;
travail et la qualiti des prestations de services.&#13;
Ainsi chaque district sanitaire sera doti &amp; travers un plan de couverture d'un riseau dit&#13;
cases de santi tenues par des agents de santi communautaires au niveau village, de ce&#13;
de santi intifr s. offrant un paquet minimum  d'activites, et d'un centre de rifirence&#13;
appeli hopital de district. Contrairement au centre midical actuel, l'h6pital de district&#13;
assure non seulement les activitis de midecine ginirale et de materniti mais igalement la&#13;
prise en charge des urgences chirurgicales et obstitricales. En fonction des situations&#13;
locales, des activitis foraines ou piriphiriques seront menies au niveau des Centres de&#13;
Santi Intigree (CSI) pour ieargir l'accessibiliti aux soins notamment priventifs.&#13;
Dans le secteur hospitalier, les hopitaux nationaux et les centres hospitaliers&#13;
dipartementaux assurent les soins tertiaires. Pour lks premiers ayant le statut d'EPA, il&#13;
s'agira de renforcer leur viabilite et pour les seconds de poursuivre la riflexion quant a&#13;
leur transformation en Etablissements &amp; Caractare Administratif (EPA.)&#13;
S'agissant du secteur privi, il occupe une faible part dans la couverture sanitaire et reste&#13;
pour l'essentiel concentri dans la capitale. Tout en rieglementant l'ouverture des&#13;
itablissements privis a travers un code de sante publique, pour garantir la qualiti des&#13;
prestations, des mesures d'encouragement seront envisagies pour promouvoir le secteur&#13;
privi sanitaire au Niger.&#13;
4. Formation du Personnel&#13;
La riussite de toute politique en matiare de sante ripose en grande partie sur Ic&#13;
diveloppement des ressources humaines. Ainsi pour disposer d'un personnel sufisant et&#13;
qualifli, l'accent sera mis sur la fonmation de base a travers les trois itablissements de&#13;
formation i savoir la Faculti des Sciences de la Sante, l'Ecole Nationale de Santi Publique&#13;
de Niamey et Zinder. La revision des programmes de formation de ces icoles sera&#13;
poursuivie de facon a les adapter aux besoins de santi.&#13;
La spicialisation des cadres a tous les niveaux se poursuivra en donnant la priotci a&#13;
l'ouverture grogressive de diffirentes sections de sWicialisation sur place pour riduire Ik&#13;
coCa de formation et mieux adapter la spicialisation au hesoins du pays.&#13;
&#13;

La reorganisauion de la gestion de laformation continue et l'intensification de la fortaiion&#13;
en cours d'emploi du personnel s'averent nicessaires. A ce niveau, il s*agira de renforcer&#13;
d'abord les acquis de Centre National de Diveloppement Sanitaire (CNDS) et de la&#13;
Circonscription Midicale de Formation et de Recherche (CIMEFOR).&#13;
Au niveau district, les iquipes cadres binificieront d'une formation en gestion et&#13;
organisation des services de santi, couplie d'un suivi sur le terrain. Laformation-pour une&#13;
mise &amp; niveau en matiere de prise en charge des urgences chirurgicales et obstitricales sera&#13;
assuree.&#13;
Au niveau le plus operationnel tous les agents binificieront d'uneformation en stratigie&#13;
plainte-traitement qui leur permettra d'assurer une meileure pnse en charge des&#13;
demandeurs de services et une prescription plus rationnelle des midicaments essentiels&#13;
giniriques.&#13;
A tous les niveaux, un accent particulier sera mis sur l'amilioration du comportement des&#13;
aEents de santi face aux malades et sur lks principes diontologiques.&#13;
5. LUAmilwtion de la Oualiti des Services&#13;
L'amilioration de la qualiti des soins concernera &amp; lafois-les soins curatifs, priventifs et&#13;
promotionnels. Ces soins respecteront lks caractiristiques des soins de santi primaires.&#13;
L'amiioration du plateau technique de l'hopital de district sera assurie. Dans le domaine&#13;
curatif, la globaliti, l'intlgration at la contipuiti des soins sera assurie a travers des&#13;
structures dicentnulisies &amp; tous lPs niveaux d'activitis pour satisfaire ks besoins de santi&#13;
des populations at ripondre rationnellement a kur demande.&#13;
En matiere de soins priventifs, las groupes &amp; risques, (mere et entfant) feront l'objet d'une&#13;
attention particulire a travers des activitis intigries de suivi pri et postnatal, -de&#13;
consultations des nourrissons, des mesures de vaccination, de rehabilitation nutritionnelle&#13;
et de planification familiale.&#13;
L'amilo,tion de l'itat nutritionnel des groupes vulnirables s'obtiendra a travers&#13;
l'ilaboration  et la mise en oeuvre des programmes concertis et inter-sectoriels&#13;
d'approvisionnement en micro-nutriments essentiels pour parer aux carences majeures&#13;
teUes que l'Avitaminose A at las Carences lodies, las Malnutritions Protiino-inergitiques.&#13;
La surveilance communautaire de la croissance det enfants appuyera cette action.&#13;
En matiere de plan&amp;fication familialk, lk faiblk taux actuel de 4,4% (EDSN 1992) de&#13;
privalence contraceptive sera sign&amp;ficativement rehaussie a 7%  par l'intigraton des&#13;
activites, la sensibilisation at k marketing social par voie midiatique at des discussions&#13;
dirigies avec lks populations. Ces actions seront complities par celles de promotion de&#13;
l'aUaitement maternel ainsi qua du bien etre familial.&#13;

definies dans le Code d'hygiene et d'assainissement de concert ayec les secteurs connexes&#13;
concernes et la pleine participation des populations.&#13;
6. Lutte contre la maladie&#13;
En matiere de surveillance et de controk des maladies notamment transmissibles la prioti&#13;
sera accordie aux affections infectieuses et parasitaires sivissant sous forme endemo-&#13;
epidimique et particulierement meurtrieres (QghldiMe infections respiratoires aiguij.&#13;
maladies diarrbiiaues d'une part et meningit  cho    d'autre part) et aux maladies&#13;
sexueUement transmissibles et Ic SIDA (MSTISIDA).&#13;
Concernant le SIDA un accent particulier sera mis sur la privention des transmissions&#13;
sexuelle, sanguine et peri-natale. Ces actions seront appuyees par des mesures relatives h&#13;
la promotion de l'information, l'education, la communication a travers lks medias,la&#13;
sensibilisation des compatriotes se rendant en exode, l'encadrement des groupes a nisque,&#13;
l'equipement et l'extension des centres de dipistages ainsi que l'eaboration d'une&#13;
ligislation en matiere de prise en charge des cas, de don de sang et des problames&#13;
d'ethique y affirent.&#13;
En matzare de vaccination la definition d'une nouvelle approche strategique combinant les&#13;
actions des services fixes avec des actions decentrais6es viendront accroitre la couverture&#13;
vaccinale des mres et des enfants. L'objectif est d'atteindre 80% de couverture vaccinalk&#13;
chez ks enfants de 0-S5 ans et chez ks femmes en age de procrier &amp; l'an 2000. Une&#13;
attention particuliere sera accordie aux maladies cibles du programme Elargi de&#13;
Vaccination (rougeok, tetanos, poliomyelite, coqueluche, tuberculose) .&#13;
L'objectif d'trradication de certaines maladies (onchocercose, dracunculose,bilharziose,&#13;
lpre, poliomyilite) sera poursuivi et mime atteint dans certains cas d'ici l'an 2000.&#13;
7. Approvisionnement et diszonibiliti des Midicaments Essentiels sous Nom G6n6naue&#13;
Cette poltique vise a rendre disponiblk ks midicaments essentiels giniriques , travers des&#13;
structures adiquates d'acquisition, de distribution et de contrOle tel qu'inonci dans la&#13;

l'O.N.P.P.C. pour en augmenter l'effcaciti at la crEaion d'un corps d'inspecteurs de&#13;
phannacie et laboratoires.&#13;
8. Information Communication dt Education pour la Santc (IEPS)&#13;
Le changement de comportement favorable a la promotion de sante reposera&#13;
essentiellement sur le dlveloppement d'une strategic intEgri d'iducation pour la santc, base&#13;

s'artculant autour de la decentralisation du systeme de sante a travers la strategie de soins&#13;
de santi pnimaires, avec un accent particulier sur la prevention, la protection de groupes&#13;
cibles, la participation organisee de la population au financement des couts de sande et la&#13;
gestion rationnelle des ressources.&#13;
Les effets conjugues de 1'extension de la couverture sanitaire, de l'amrioration de la&#13;
qualiti des soins et du renforcement de la medecine preventive assureront ineluctablement&#13;
une amelioration des indicateurs de santd.&#13;
Pour assurer une riussite des intentions proclamies et des objectifs diJinis, un systeme de&#13;
suivi/ivaluation sera mis en place. n permettra de mesurer periodiquement les progris&#13;

REPUBLIC OF NIGER&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
With input from the public expenditure review mission, in the field at the same time as the health&#13;
pre-appraisal and appraisal missions, and in collaboration with a health economist from the World Health&#13;
Organization, an economic analysis of Niger's National Health Sector Development Plan (PDS) was&#13;
carried out as an integral part of the project preparation process. This analysis, which evaluated the&#13;
appropriateness, affordability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of reforms, approaches and activities&#13;
envisaged in the PDS, was carried out in conformity with guidelines issued by the World Bank's Human&#13;
Development Department (HDD), entitled Economic Analysis in the Population, Health and Nutrition&#13;
Sectors: A Conceptual Frameworkfor Task Managers, by Alexander Preker, January 2, 1996. In line&#13;
with the strategy agreed between the Bank and the Government to design the proposed operation around&#13;
a sector investment program (SIP) approach, Niger's entire program (vs. the IDA-financed project) was&#13;
the object of this economic analysis.&#13;
Linkages with Economic and Sector Work&#13;
Country objectives for Niger, reflected in IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), are to&#13;
strengthen economic competitiveness, and reduce poverty by reversing the downward trends in per capita&#13;
incomes and improving social indicators. Specific objectives for the social sectors are to improve&#13;
primary school enrollment from the current low level of 29 percent to 35 percent by 1999, and to&#13;
increase basic primary health coverage from 32 to 45 percent by 2002. This latter target is taken directly&#13;
from Niger's PDS. The strategy for attaining CAS objectives is based on four major building blocks: (a)&#13;
addressing long-term human capital (including poverty alleviation) and natural resources issues; (b)&#13;
building public and private sector institutions to promote private sector based growth; (c) increasing&#13;
efficiency of public resource management; and (d) supporting actions to accompany the CFA franc&#13;
devaluation. IDA's health SIP objectives and strategies are congruent with the CAS. Indeed, the policy&#13;
reforms and the investments envisaged in the PDS render the proposed SIP a unique instrument for&#13;
addressing key elements of the CAS objectives.&#13;
The Policy Framework Paper (PFP), agreed between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund&#13;
and the Government of Niger in April 1996, is closely linked to, and supportive of Niger's PDS, and&#13;
consistent with the Bank's health sector dialogue. In full endorsement of the objectives laid out in the&#13;
PDS, the PFP calls for the demonopolization and restructuring of Niger's ONPPC, with a view to&#13;
improving the affordability and availability of essential generic drugs to the entire population and to&#13;
opening up the market to private competition. It also calls for a doubling of the health share of the public&#13;
general budget over the next three years.&#13;
A public expenditure review mission visited Niger in April 1996, and focussed particularly on&#13;
the health sector, as a priority.  This mission evaluated budget and expenditure allocations and&#13;
recommended ways in which these might be reoriented to be more reflective of PDS objectives and&#13;
strategies. Implementation of these allocations will be monitored during the life of the project. This&#13;
mission also prepared estimates of investment and recurrent costs of implementing the PDS over the next&#13;
5 years and highlighted opportunities for cost minimization. In addition, human resources implications&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 2 of 17&#13;
of PDS implementation were assessed jointly with MOPH, taking into account limits on new&#13;
recruitrnents specified in the PFP, and a plan of action for addressing these implications was prepared by&#13;
MOPH and discussed and agreed during negotiations. Under the proposed project, this PER process will&#13;
be institutionalized. MOPH capacity will be developed to undertake periodic reviews of budgets, costs,&#13;
expenditures, financing and human resources needs. Dialogue with Ministry of Finance and with MOPH&#13;
on the process and results of the health sector public expenditure review was carried out jointly with the&#13;
health mission.&#13;
The Niger poverty assessment, A Resilient People in a Harsh Environment, highlights improved&#13;
access to primary health (and other social) services as an important component of a poverty strategy.&#13;
This report endorses the objectives and orientations of the PDS and recommends that Niger be supported&#13;
in its implementation. With regard to affordability of services, the report underlines the importance of&#13;
strengthening capacity to procure essential generic drugs on the international market to minimize their&#13;
cost to the public, and, as well, the importance of ensuring that cost recovery initiatives will not inhibit&#13;
utilization of health services by Niger's most vulnerable groups: women, children and the poor. The&#13;
proposed IDA operation will support efforts to these ends.&#13;
The policy framework for the health sector is deemed to be adequate, given Niger's health&#13;
problems and issues, and given, as well, financial and capacity constraints. The main components of the&#13;
PDS aim to: (a) improve the quality of existing services and extend service coverage from 32 to 45&#13;
percent; (b) improve the availability and affordability of essential generic drugs; (c) improve sector&#13;
efficiency through strengthening and decentralization of key management functions; and (d) expand&#13;
sector capacity through better utilization of non-governmental sector capacity. As described earlier in&#13;
this section, the policy framework is fully coherent with the macroeconomic dialogue.&#13;
Analysis of Alternatives Guiding Project Design&#13;
Health vs. Non-Health Investments. It has not been feasible, within the framework of the work&#13;
undertaken for the proposed IDA operation, to examine the relative health benefits of health sector vs.&#13;
non-health sector investments. The main option would lie in the field of education, with focus on&#13;
expanding primary education with a particular focus on girls. As a practical matter, such investments&#13;
should not be seen as alternatives to health sector investments in Niger, because the Bank and other&#13;
donors wish to finance education investments in exactly these areas regardless of the investments being&#13;
undertaken in the health sector. Both basic education and basic health services investments and&#13;
development programs are needed, and are not in competition for donor funds. Another option would be&#13;
a broad-based attack on food security and nutrition issues. Nutrition services are included within the&#13;
minimum package of activities (PMA) specified in the PDS and will be supported under the IDA&#13;
operation. Food security issues merit greater attention, as is indicated in the above-mentioned poverty&#13;
assessment. The PDS lies entirely within the responsibility of MOPH to implement and so the proposed&#13;
IDA investment is not the appropriate vehicle for this.&#13;
Alternatives within the Health Sector. Several alternatives for investment strategy within the&#13;
health sector were considered.&#13;
The Status-Quo Alternative. It is reasonable to assume that maintaining the status quo in the&#13;
sector would result in a further deterioration of the already poor provision of health services to the&#13;
general public: (a) consumers in rural areas would not gain access to acceptable health services; (b)&#13;
quality of health services, particularly at the primary level, would remain very low; (c) the lack of&#13;
information and low levels of meaningful community participation would continue to hamper rational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 3 of 17&#13;
decision-making by consumers and would not prompt improved client orientation and accountability of&#13;
the health system; (d) expenditures by private households on traditional healers and drug peddlers could&#13;
not be recouped in favor of better services; and (e) preventive and promotional (public health) services,&#13;
such as immunization or vector control, would continue to be supplied below optimal levels.&#13;
Indirect vs. Direct Interventions. An important theme in the PDS is the gradual reorientation of&#13;
Government interventions and expenditures away from direct supply of services towards indirect&#13;
interventions that stimulate the actors for better health at the household and community levels to&#13;
encourage increasingly healthy behavior, whether through health promotion, regulatory action, or&#13;
provision of funds as close as possible to the operational level, rather than through a heavy, vertically-&#13;
oriented bureaucracy. An orientation towards demand variables is evident in policy changes in favor of&#13;
decentralization and community participation in strategic management and management of resources.&#13;
This will imply a considerable evolution in the institutional culture of MOPH, which is,still excessively&#13;
centralized and vertical in its organization of programs and services.&#13;
Supply Options for Broad Access to Health Services. The private-for-profit sector is not a&#13;
meaningful option, for the present and foreseeable future, for substantially expanding access to basic&#13;
health care, especially in the less densely populated rural areas. Private-for-profit care in urban areas,&#13;
both through drug sales and through establishment of private practices, does show some potential and&#13;
MOPH, in its letter of sector development policy outlines its vision for exploiting this potential. The&#13;
drafting and adoption of phannaceutical law will permit the private sector to compete in the drug sector,&#13;
with some regulation. This being said, the market failure of the private sector must be kept in the&#13;
forefront. Health services, particularly those of a public health/preventive nature, are not lucrative.&#13;
Neither are the sale of essential generic drugs, compared to brand-name and luxury pharmaceutical&#13;
products. The public mission of basic services provision does not make for meaningful substitutability&#13;
of private for public care in a poor country like Niger except in certain very specific situations such as&#13;
providing for the wealthiest members of the community in the urban area.&#13;
Private voluntary organizations have historically been weak in Niger, but MOPH has recently&#13;
changed its perspective by welcoming NGOs as partners. In this light, the private voluntary sub-sector&#13;
should be seen not as an alternative, but as a complement to public sector provision, and as a factor likely&#13;
to grow in importance in the future. Under the proposed operation health initiatives of community-based&#13;
organizations in support of objectives laid out in district health plans will be pursued through contracting&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
Recent reform has transformed the three national hospitals and two schools of public health into&#13;
"etablissements public a caractere administratif", thus granting them financial and managerial autonomy&#13;
and status as essentially "contractors" to MOPH.   This could provide these institutions with great&#13;
opportunity to achieve improved efficiency and financial sustainability, but this can only be done with&#13;
sufficient management capacity. The proposed operation will support and nurture this process. The&#13;
legal status of peripheral facilities (CSI) is a topic that is being discussed and pursued. Experimentation&#13;
in the country on according them an association or cooperative status (vs. their current status as public&#13;
facilities) is being pursued and should bear interesting results.&#13;
Fiscal and Financial Impact&#13;
Program Costs. The total cost of PDS implementation over the next five years is estimated at&#13;
about US$275 million equivalent, of which US$135million equivalent is for investment and US$140&#13;
million equivalent is for recurrent costs. Over 75 percent of total costs will support district (basic and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 4 of 17&#13;
first-referral) health services. Appendix 1 to this Annex provides detailed costs and the basis for&#13;
assumptions and unit costs.&#13;
Program Financing. Government is expected to contribute US$116.4 million equivalent over&#13;
the program period, of which US$7.8 million for investments and US$108.6 million for recurrent costs.&#13;
Local administrative budgets (collectivites locales) will contribute some US$5.7 million for investment&#13;
(US$3.1 million equivalent) and recurrent (US$2.6 million equivalent) costs. In addition, revenues&#13;
generated from cost recovery are estimated to finance some US$10.4 million equivalent of recurrent drug&#13;
costs. These estimates are based on MOPH's health financing policy, as proposed in the PDS (and&#13;
supported in the PFP), which specifies that: health's share of the State recurrent budget should increase&#13;
from its current (1996) level of 6.6 percent to 10 percent by the year 2000; that a minimum of 5-8&#13;
percent of local administrative budgets should be allocated to health; and that revenues generated from&#13;
cost recovery should eventually cover 100 percent of drug costs at the primary level, and a progressively&#13;
smaller percentage for the higher levels of care. IDA will contribute US$40.0 million equivalent, and the&#13;
balance of PDS costs (US$103.0 million equivalent) will be covered by the various external partners&#13;
active in the sector (multilateral and bilateral agencies and NGOs), as laid out in their program&#13;
commitments. MOPH's challenge will be to manage effectively external aid coming into the sector and&#13;
to channel it directly to cover activities included in the PDS. Given the quality and appropriateness of&#13;
the PDS document, donors have expressed willingness to contribute to its objectives and are keen to&#13;
achieve better coordination in the sector. Annual review meetings of Program costs and financing (para.&#13;
3.27 of SAR), and a possible Donors' Round Table in 1997 will be important vehicles for this work.&#13;
Financial Sustainability. By the end of the initial five-year period, recurrent costs of health&#13;
system functioning (encompassing already existing and incremental recurrent costs) will amount to about&#13;
US$33 million equivalent annually. National contributions to recurrent costs by the end of the Program&#13;
period are projected to exceed this amount, encompassing the annual financial participation of&#13;
Government (US$24.8 million equivalent), local administrative budgets (US$0.8 million equivalent) and&#13;
revenues generated from cost recovery (US$5.4 million equivalent, covering virtually 100 percent of&#13;
annual recurrent costs). These estimates are based on the assumption that the projected financial&#13;
contributions of the various national partners, as laid out in the PDS will in fact be realized. This&#13;
objective is feasible but at the same time, a challenge, and will be monitored very closely over the&#13;
Program period. It must be noted that, given Niger's very precarious economic and financial situation,&#13;
implementation of an eventual second phase of the PDS will require the support of external partners over&#13;
the medium-term. The health financing policy laid out in the PDS is cognizant of this very real&#13;
constraint and takes into account the programmed contributions of external partners, including NGOs,&#13;
who have contributed, and will continue to contribute both to investment and recurrent costs.&#13;
These estimates are tentative, at best, and provide only a basis for continued monitoring and&#13;
refinement in light of experience. The public expenditure review and health missions provided an&#13;
opportunity to collect information and establish a data base on costs and financing of the PDS. This&#13;
work represents an important, albeit initial, step. A crucial next step will be the ongoing review and&#13;
refinement of program costs, objectives and financing plans in light of experience. The PDS, with&#13;
assistance from the proposed project, will strengthen MOPH capacity in programming, budgeting and&#13;
financial planning, monitoring and evaluation to this end. An important instrument in monitoring and&#13;
evaluating program sustainability will be the annual reviews of program performance, which will review&#13;
Program costs and financing (actual and projections) and pace of implementation. Depending on&#13;
Program experience and perspectives for the future any one or several of these variables may well be&#13;
revised to ensure the feasibility and financial sustainability of Program content.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 5 of 17&#13;
In June 1995 a law was passed requiring that cost recovery be applied at the primary health care&#13;
level. Based on a number of pilot activities, mechanisms for cost recovery are being refined and will be&#13;
extended nationwide during the initial five-year period of the PDS. The goal of cost recovery is to&#13;
recover 100 percent of the costs of drug stock replenishment at the primary level. This goal is based on&#13;
experience thus far in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. A number of inputs are necessary to&#13;
contribute to successful cost recovery, among which: the establishment of appropriate pricing&#13;
mechanisms for essential generic drugs, in coordination with the private sector, and the refinement of&#13;
tools and mechanisms for the management of drug stocks and for the collection and management of&#13;
revenues generated from cost recovery. The correct application of criteria to exempt true indigents from&#13;
fees will also be a challenge. Close monitoring and evaluation, supplemented by operational research to&#13;
be supported under the project, will support a learning process and allow finetuning to optimize cost&#13;
recovery results.  Until better information is gotten, it is estimated that cost recovery, once fully&#13;
operational, will cover 100 percent of drug costs at the primary level and 50 percent of drug costs at the&#13;
district hospital level.&#13;
Cost-Effectiveness&#13;
The 1993 World Development Report (WDR) evaluated the cost effectiveness of various health&#13;
interventions and found two clusters of selected interventions to be highly cost effective: (a) public&#13;
health interventions (immunizations, family planning, improvements to household environment, AIDS&#13;
prevention, and school-based services); and (b) clinical services (pregnancy related care, family&#13;
planning, STD prevention and control, control of tuberculosis, and prevention and treatment of diseases,&#13;
which most severely affect adult, infant and child mortality: acute respiratory infections, measles,&#13;
malaria and acute malnutrition). Africa region-specific economic analysis carried out in the context of&#13;
Better Health for Africa (BHA), has revealed that the transformation of these cost-effective interventions&#13;
into a minimum package of services, provided through a well-functioning district system, with proper&#13;
referral capacity, should (a) enable African countries to manage more than 90 percent of health care&#13;
demands; and (b) reduce the burden of disease by 30 percent.&#13;
Because of the time and cost involved, and because of the broadly similar epidemiological and&#13;
socio-economic conditions among African countries, in lieu of undertaking a separate cost-effectiveness&#13;
analysis, the preappraisal and appraisal missions compared Niger's minimum package of activities&#13;
(PMA) with minimum packages recommended by the Bank in WDR 93 and in BHA. Broadly speaking,&#13;
this analysis shows that Niger's PDS is in line with recommendations of WDR '93 and with BHA for&#13;
achieving cost effectiveness, both through its choice of interventions (minimum package of services&#13;
responds fully to health priorities of Niger and include the most cost-effective interventions) and through&#13;
its proposed mode of delivery (GON has opted for a district health system). The results of this analysis&#13;
are presented in Appendix 2 to this Annex.&#13;
Discussions with the Government of the results of this economic analysis have brought to light&#13;
the following insights, which have served to finetune project design and interventions and which also&#13;
should serve to guide the transformation of the national and district PDS into a detailed Program, which&#13;
would be feasible, affordable, and cost-effective. In summary the cost-effectiveness analysis has&#13;
culminated in the following recommendations:&#13;
* There is scope for further consolidation and prioritization of the minimum package of activities to&#13;
respond more fully and effectively to Niger's priority health concerns: maternal and child health&#13;
care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 6 of 17&#13;
*  There is also scope for minimizing costs of infrastructure through: (i) minimization of unit costs; and&#13;
(ii) elimination of plans to create district hospitals in chef lieux des departements, which already&#13;
have CHD.&#13;
*  Scarce human resources can be more effectively mobilized and used through redeployment and&#13;
through the provision of specialized training to nurses and other paramedical staff to work in district&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
*  Phasing of rehabilitation and extension activities can be revised to prioritize the most cost effective&#13;
interventions, as follows: improving existing services, and phasing construction of new services,&#13;
starting with facilities that would cover the largest populations: CSI 2 (serving population of 10,000&#13;
within a 5 km radius), CSI 1 (serving population of 5,000 within a 5 km radius), and CSI 2 and CSI I&#13;
serving populations within a 10 km radius.&#13;
*  For reasons of equity, investments in extension of service coverage should be targetted with a view&#13;
to bringing all regions up to the 45% coverage target rather than investing heavily in areas that have&#13;
already achieved this target.&#13;
*  A fuller assessment of constraints and risks will equip MOPH to plan realistically and to develop&#13;
strategies to manage and overcome such risks&#13;
*  Decentralization and partnership initiatives will provide considerable opportunity for expanding&#13;
capacity and for more effective utilization of capacity. However, they also present considerable&#13;
risks.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis Linked to Major Risk Factors&#13;
Political Stability and Ownership of the PDS. The ICR on the first health project noted that&#13;
political instability during the life of the project caused activities in all sectors to slow down and even&#13;
come to a standstill during the various crises inherent in the process. In addition, and more specifically,&#13;
the high turnover of health ministers during the life of the project (8 ministers in 9 years) caused&#13;
numerous delays, as each new minister revisited and questioned project objectives and implementation&#13;
progress. The coup d'etat, which took place in January 1996, precipitated another change in ministers;&#13;
and the presidential elections, recently completed may result in more changes at the ministerial level, and&#13;
possibly even among some of the more highly placed technical staff. While this is likely to generate&#13;
some disruption costs, it is not likely to threaten in a serious way the ownership of the PDS. Thanks to a&#13;
very participatory process in the preparation of the PDS, and, in addition, to the decentralized (district)&#13;
planning and programming process, ownership of PDS objectives is broad-based and strong, among&#13;
many important stakeholders, including: the population, decentralized MOPH personnel (both service&#13;
providers and decision-makers), local authorities, and NGOs.&#13;
Institutional Resistence to Reforms. There is some resistence within MOPH to reforms&#13;
envisaged under the PDS. Most particularly, decentralization of management and administration, and&#13;
integration of programs and services, is seen as threatening by some senior officials in MOPH central&#13;
level, who feel that these initiatives may cause them to lose resources and decision-making authority to&#13;
the lower levels of the system. Strong ownership by many important stakeholders (described above) and&#13;
the continued involvement of those resistent to impending changes to highlight opportunities in their&#13;
evolving roles are strategies to mitigate this risk.&#13;
Donor Assistance. PDS implementation will necessarily be dependent on external assistance to&#13;
the health sector at least for the medium-term. In reaction to the coup d'etat of January 1996, virtually&#13;
all bilateral assistance was suspended. However, now that the July 1996 elections are concluded, it is&#13;
expected that development of new projects will resume.  If donor assistance were not in fact&#13;
forthcoming, as is currently projected, the PDS may have to be scaled back to focus exclusively on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 7 of 17&#13;
efforts to strengthen existing services so as not to exceed limited capacity to finance investment and&#13;
recurrent costs of the PDS. As noted earlier in this Annex, national capacity to finance the incremental&#13;
reccurrent costs generated by PDS investments would be adequate if all national financing sources&#13;
[general budget, local administrative budget, and communities through cost recovery] respect obligations&#13;
laid out in PDS. While a challenge, fulifilment of these obligations is feasible and will be closely&#13;
monitored. In the event national financing sources fall short of projections, investments will be cut back&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
Institutional Capacity Analysis.&#13;
The quality and effectiveness of Niger's health system are seriously constrained by weak&#13;
management capacity. Roles and responsibilities for management and decision-making are excessively&#13;
centralized, particularly with regard to management of resources. Those best placed to make informed&#13;
decisions on the optimal use of resources (i.e., those at the more decentralized levels of the system) have&#13;
neither the authority, the means, nor the essential skills for carrying out key management functions. In&#13;
fact, there is a lack of capacity at all levels of the system to carry out functions which are crucial to the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of health sector operations, notably: planning, programming and budgeting;&#13;
resource mobilization and aid coordination; management of human, physical and financial resources;&#13;
training and supervision -- both of a technical and of an administrative nature; quality control; and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, roles and responsibilities at each level of the system for&#13;
carrying out key management functions have not been clearly defined (although it must be noted that&#13;
recent initiatives are addressing this issue.).&#13;
Management tools, systems and processes are ambiguous and underutilized, if they exist at all,&#13;
thus further inhibiting sector effectiveness. There are neither national norms nor rational criteria for the&#13;
effective and equitable allocation of sector resources. Budget allocation is based on past patterns without&#13;
due consideration of real needs and equity concerns. Management of material and financial resources is&#13;
inadequate due to the lack of a performing accounting system at all levels of the system. There is no&#13;
system or tools for the evaluation of health personnel. The setting up of a National Health Information&#13;
System (SNIS) with the assistance of USAID has been a major contribution to improved sector&#13;
management.  Established at all levels of services its objective is the collection and analysis of&#13;
information, its wide dissemination and its effective utilization in management and decision-making. It&#13;
provides information on the extent of health problems of Niger's population and key information to&#13;
facilite, at all levels of the system, the management, evaluation and improvements to program&#13;
performance. Considerable effort, however, will be needed to exploit fully the utility of this tool,&#13;
including: ensuring adequate human resources for its use; building capacity at DDS and district levels in&#13;
its use; and encouraging its full analysis and use in decision-making by managers of health facilities.&#13;
Community Participation and Intersectoral Coordination are basic principles of the primary&#13;
health care approach, embraced by Niger's health policy. Neither of these principles are as yet fully&#13;
applied, however, although efforts are underway to improve performance in this regard. With the&#13;
assistance of the first IDA-financed health project and that of USAID, pilot studies tested community&#13;
participation in the financing of primary health services. These studies have demonstrated, as is the case&#13;
in other countries, that community participation in the financing of health services and in the&#13;
management of collected revenues provides communities with some leverage in their demand for quality&#13;
services and incites the health system to be more client oriented and thus improve that quality. UNICEF&#13;
(through the application of its Bamako Initiative) and projects financed by other partners have also&#13;
applied various notions of community participation in the financing and management of primary health&#13;
services. From this experience, the MOPH is now challenged to develop a framework for eliciting and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 8of17&#13;
applying nationwide the participation of communities in the financing and management of primary&#13;
health services, in line with their comparative advantages, to render the system more accountable to its&#13;
clients. Again, considerable efforts are being initiated by MOPH to this end.&#13;
The National Health Committee and its extensions at the departmental, arrondissement and&#13;
commune levels (COTEDEP, COTEAR, COTECOM) (see para. 2.12 of SAR) have not sufficiently&#13;
focused on the review of health policy and its application. This is due primarily to two factors. First, its&#13;
mandate is intersectoral and holistic in nature, which does not permnit it to provide sufficient time to&#13;
focus exclusively on the health sector. Second, even in the application of its intersectoral mandate, the&#13;
lack of clear direction on how to focus on the key issues leaves it ill-equipped to carry out its functions&#13;
concerning the health sector.   While there is much scope for community participation, intersectoral&#13;
coordination and collaboration with other partners (NGOs, private-for-profit sector, academia, etc.),&#13;
particularly at the operational level, no organizational structure exists currently that would effectively&#13;
elicit and coordinate such partnerships.&#13;
Human Resources. While crucial to achieving national objectives of improving the quality and&#13;
coverage of services, many issues surrounding human resources for health severely dampen efforts in&#13;
this regard. Human resources for health are inadequate in terms of numbers (ratios of technical staff to&#13;
population are far below WHO standards) and distribution (80 percent of technical staff are in and&#13;
around Niamey). Their skills are inadequate due to a number of factors. Basic training curricula are not&#13;
well adapted to the real demands and responsibilities of service provision at the various levels of the&#13;
system in Niger. Neither does inservice training respond to the urgent needs to strengthen service&#13;
delivery quality. Health personnel are very demoralized: salaries are not received regularly; the system&#13;
for management and evaluation of human resources is excessively centralized and is not designed to&#13;
monitor performance and to reward or sanction such performance. The lack of a supervision system&#13;
leaves technical staff isolated and does not give them the opportunity for fine-tuning of their skills and&#13;
constructive feedback on their performance. Capacity for manpower planning is very low. Inadequate&#13;
systems and skills for human resources management render MOPH hard-pressed to compile the most&#13;
basic information on numbers of technical staff currently employed, their levels and allocation across the&#13;
country. The human resources implications of the new reforms envisaged under the PDS had not been&#13;
assessed, until the World Bank public expenditure review mission (April 1996) initiated this process.&#13;
This task is a first, crucial step in ensuring that the feasibility and pace of objectives to decentralize,&#13;
restructure and expand health services can be fully appreciated and amended in light of human resources&#13;
constraints and in reviewing and revising human resources policy and strategy to assure the success of&#13;
these reforms.&#13;
The PDS is essentially a capacity building program, which intends to address the myriad&#13;
weaknesses in management and institutional capacity described above. Among the most pertinent of its&#13;
capacity strengthening interventions are: strengthening and decentralization of strategic sector&#13;
management and management of sector resources, expanding sector capacity through more effective&#13;
utilization of non-governmental partners in sector management and support services and in service&#13;
delivery, and improving regulatory capacity and legal environment for more competition and lower&#13;
prices in the pharmaceutical sector. In addition, sector dialogue is well coordinated with macroeconomic&#13;
dialogue and thus not limited to MOPH but also, necessarily, encompasses Ministries of Civil Service,&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Plan and the High Commissioner in charge of Decentralization, all of whose&#13;
decisions and support of health sector reforms are crucial to their success.&#13;

Poverty Alleviation Impact Analysis&#13;
A recent poverty assessment entitled, A Resilient People in a Harsh Environment: Niger Poverty&#13;
Assessment (April 3, 1996), presents a consensus among policymakers and development partners on a&#13;
three-pronged approach to poverty reduction: (i) sound macroeconomic policies that stimulate labor-&#13;
intensive and sustainable growth, (ii) better access to basic social services, and (iii) safety nets. Investing&#13;
in education and health (including nutrition and family planning) is the starting point to fulfilling the&#13;
second key element of the poverty reduction strategy. In Niger, greater human resource development&#13;
will help restore conditions for economic growth. Improving health by lowering the incidence of&#13;
infectious and parasitic illnesses, especially among children, and fertility by reducing demand for large&#13;
families, are critical to obtaining a strong path toward growth. Despite Niger's efforts to expand&#13;
investments in the social sectors, much remains to be done to increase access by the poor, who are most&#13;
in need. Expenditures need to be retargeted toward rural areas, where 80 percent of the poor live; and the&#13;
intra-sectoral expenditure allocations need to be retargeted toward the primary levels in both education&#13;
and health.&#13;
The poverty assessment strongly endorses Niger's 5-year health sector development plan (PDS),&#13;
noting that its strategy aims to reallocate resources to address the four imbalances in the health sector,&#13;
which weaken its efficiency: curative care versus preventive, hospital versus primary health care, urban&#13;
versus rural areas, and regional disparities. The above-mentioned report also highlights the following&#13;
aspects of PDS strategy, which are critical for poverty alleviation. All of these points will be pursued&#13;
and supported under the Program and Project:&#13;
*  Rural areas and areas with the worst health coverage and infrastructure should receive priority for&#13;
public investments and a larger share of current expenditures. Health personnel need to be given&#13;
incentives to relocate to rural areas.&#13;
*  MOPH  should be more effective and client-oriented through decentralization and increased&#13;
community participation.&#13;
*  Although an estimated package of health care can be provided in most low-income countries for&#13;
about US$8 per person, in Niger it costs more, given the immense size of the country and the&#13;
population dispersion.  The planned increase in the total government budget is an essential&#13;
prerequisite for basic health care services in Niger.&#13;
*  Efficient procurement and distribution of essential generic drugs across the country is a priority to&#13;
improve availability and keep costs low.&#13;
*  A law on cost recovery for primary health care has been passed. Studies in some countries,&#13;
including pilot trials in Niger, have shown that cost recovery schemes improve service utilization if&#13;
they incorporate improvements in service and quality, such as better drug availability, staff&#13;
upgrading, better deployment, and extended hours. Under the PDS, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
activities will be undertaken to assess its impact on the poor.&#13;
*  MOPH's intention to encourage the efforts of partners in health care (NGOs, communities,&#13;
academics and others) is likely to benefit the poor, as many of these partners target their activities to&#13;
areas of greatest need.&#13;
*  Careful monitoring of selected health indicators (both process and impact), supplemented by&#13;
operational research, beneficiary assessments and periodic evaluations, would enable MOPH to learn&#13;
from experience and improve basic service delivery to the poor.&#13;
*  Programs to provide universal access to safe water and to improve environmental sanitation should&#13;
be launched with community participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 10 of 17&#13;
The inclusion of all of these points in Niger's PDS demonstrate that this country's health strategy is&#13;
poverty sensitive.&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
The Program will have a positive environmental impact through activities promoting human and&#13;
household waste disposal and sanitation. The health promotion activities by the health district teams and&#13;
community management committees will create greater community awareness of the measures needed to&#13;
protect the environment and keep public places (health facilities, schools, and markets) clean and&#13;
provided with basic sanitation facilities. In-service programs under the Program will include training of&#13;
clinical staff in proper procedures for handling and disposing of blood products, needles and other&#13;
hazardous materials and in mobilizing communities to improve the environment for better health. The&#13;
Program will also provide safe water supplies in all health facilities that it covers.&#13;
Performance Criteria for Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
See Annex 8 of SAR.&#13;
Overall Judgement of Project Justification&#13;
Previous health missions have already acknowledged the quality of the PDS document, and the&#13;
appropriateness of its goals, objectives and strategies. It has also been confirmed that both the content of&#13;
Niger's minimum package of activities, and the system through which these services will be delivered&#13;
are in line with Bank's recommendations for the sector and thus economically justified. Our missions&#13;
have also noted, however, that national and district PDS goals appear to be very ambitious given a&#13;
number of constraints, including: timeframe, management and absorptive capacity, human resources&#13;
implications, recurrent financing implications. An important lesson learned from the implementation of&#13;
the first IDA-financed health project was the need to set goals and objectives that are cognizant of and&#13;
commensurate with implementation constraints. An important objective of this economic analysis was&#13;
thus to provide concrete guidance on where and how the costs of implementing the PDS might be&#13;
minimized, and how the effectiveness of proposed interventions could be maximized, and to provide&#13;
guidance on how to set priorities and phase interventions, in light of these constraints. This analysis also&#13;
highlights risks and suggests a process approach to minimization and better management of these risks.&#13;
Costs and financing of the PDS will need to be monitored closely; and objectives and activities should be&#13;
reviewed periodically in light of real constraints with a view to scaling them back, if necessary, and/or to&#13;
increasing the timeframe for their implementation to be more in line with Niger's absorptive capacity&#13;
and financing capacity.&#13;

            With the overall objective of improving
            the health and well-being of Niger's population, the
            Health Sector Development Program Project seeks to: 1)
            improve the quality and coverage of basic health services,
            with a particular focus on establishing and supporting the
            district health system; 2) improve the availability and
            affordability of essential generic drugs through the
            restructuring and strengthening of the pharmaceutical
            sector; and 3) improve sector effectiveness and efficiency
            through: (i) interventions to strengthen and decentralize
            strategic sector management and management of resources; and
            (ii) efforts to appreciate more fully and to utilize more
            effectively the capacity of various partners active in the
            health sector in implementing national and district
