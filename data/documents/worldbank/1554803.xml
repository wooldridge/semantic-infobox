Abstract&#13;
Since 1968, Hungary has attempted to combine central planning of&#13;
the economy with a significant decentralization of economic&#13;
decisionmaking at the enterprise level. In pursuing this objective,&#13;
Hungarian economic authorities have increased their reliance on&#13;
indirect controls (called "economic regulators") and market forces, as&#13;
opposed to central directives, to guide the enterprises. At the same&#13;
time, they have preserved a number of the bureaucratic structures that&#13;
are characteristic of the more traditional socialist economies and&#13;
have maintained a strong commitment to equity in income distribution.&#13;
The reform process has not been linear. Changes in the international&#13;
economic environment in the 1970s have led Hungary to periodically&#13;
modify its system of economic management. The country's policymakers&#13;
now confront the complex task of developing a technologically advanced&#13;
socialist economy that is capable of adapting rapidly to changing&#13;
world conditions which it cannot control, within the constraints&#13;
imposed by the economic management system that has been chosen, and&#13;
the country's history, geography, and resource endowments.&#13;
This paper describes the current economic decisionmaking&#13;
structures above the enterprise level. It looks at the role of&#13;
planning in the Hungarian economic management system and examines some&#13;
of the principal "economic regulators" used by the authorities to&#13;
influence enterprises in the pursuit of planned macroeconomic and&#13;
sectoral goals. In the final section, the paper discusses three&#13;
dilemmas facing Hungary's policymakers. Is it better to pursue a&#13;
capability for rapid response to the changing external environment at&#13;
the cost of reducing the broad participation in decisionmaking which&#13;
has provided support for the reform process? Should equity in income&#13;
distribution, which is seen as a major achievement of Hungarian&#13;
socialist development, be sacrificed in order to spur greater economic&#13;
efficiency? Should short-term stabilization of the economy be&#13;
pursued, which may introduce some uncertainties in the investment&#13;
decisions of enterprises and possibly slow the process of structural&#13;
transformation, to make the economy more competitive in the medium&#13;
term? The paper concludes that the three trade-offs confronting&#13;
Hungarian policymakers are interrelated and can be alleviated by&#13;
improvements in the international economic environment.&#13;

Desde 1968, Hungria ha tratado de combinar la planificaci6n central de la&#13;
economia con una importante descentralizaci6n del proceso de adopci6n de deci-&#13;
siones econ6micas a nivel de las empresas. En cumplimiento de este objetivo,&#13;
las autoridades econ6micas hungaras han comenzado a recurrir mas a los controles&#13;
indirectos (llamados "reguladores econ6micos") y a las fuerzas del mercado que a&#13;
las directivas centrales, para orientar a las empresas. Al mismo tiempo, han&#13;
conservado varias estructuras burocraticas que son caracteristicas de las econo-&#13;
mias socialistas mas tradicionales y han procurado firmemente resDetar la equi-&#13;
dad en materia de distribuci6n del ingreso. El proceso de reforma no ha seguido&#13;
una trayectoria recta. Los cambios producidos en la situacion econ6mica inter-&#13;
nacional en la decada de 1970 han hecho que Hungria modifique peri6dicamente su&#13;
sistema de gesti6n econ6mica. Las autoridades encargadas de dictar las politi-&#13;
cas del pais se encuentran ahora frente a la compleja tarea de desarrollar una&#13;
economia socialista tecnol6gicamente avanzada, que sea capaz de adaptarse&#13;
rapidamente a una situacion internacional cambiante que no pueden controlar,&#13;
dentro de las limitaciones impuestas por el sistema de gesti6n econ6mica que ha&#13;
sido elegido y de la historia, la geografia y los recursos del pais.&#13;
En el presente documento se describen las estructuras del proceso de adop-&#13;
ci6n de decisiones econ6micas en niveles mas altos que el de las empresas. Se&#13;
pasa revista a la funci6n de la planificaci6n en el sistema hungaro de gesti6n&#13;
econ6mica y se examinan algunos de los "reguladores econ6micos" principales&#13;
empleados por las autoridades para influir en las empresas a fin de alcanzar los&#13;
objetivos macroecon6micos y sectoriales planificados. En la ultima secci6n del&#13;
documento se analizan tres dilemas que enfrentan las autoridades encargadas de&#13;
adoptar las politicas en Hungria. ,Es mejor tratar de conseguir la capacidad de&#13;
reaccionar con rapidez ante la cambiante situaci6n externa, a expensas de redu-&#13;
cir la participaci6n general en la adopci6n de decisiones que ha brindado apoyo&#13;
para el proceso de reforma? ZDebe sacrificarse el princioio de equidad en la&#13;
distribuci6n del ingreso, que ha sido uno de los principales logros del desa-&#13;
rrollo socialista hungaro, a fin de fomentar una mayor eficiencia econ6mica?&#13;
ZHay que tratar de conseguir una estabilizacion a corto plazo de la economia, lo&#13;
cual puede introducir cierta incertidumbre en las decisiones relativas a inver-&#13;
siones de las empresas y, posiblemente, desacelerar el proceso de transformacion&#13;
estructural, para hacer a la economia mas competitiva a mediano plazo? En el&#13;
documento se llega a la conclusi6n de que los tres dilemas que se les presentan&#13;
a las autoridades de Hungria estan interrelacionados y pueden alinearse si&#13;
mejora la situaci6n econ6mica internacional.&#13;

Depuis 1968, la Hongrie s'efforce de decentraliser largement, dans le&#13;
cadre de son 6conomie planifi6e, le processus de decision 6conomique au&#13;
niveau des entreprises. Pour y parvenir, les responsables de 116conomie&#13;
hongroise recourent davantage A un systeme de contr6les indirects (appeles&#13;
"regulateurs economiques") ainsi qu'aux lois du marche - par opposition A&#13;
des directives centralisees - pour donner aux entreprises les orientations&#13;
voulues. Ils ont conserve en meme temps un certain nombre des structures&#13;
bureaucratiques caracteristiques des economies socialistes plus tradi-&#13;
tionnelles et sont restes tres attaches au principe d'une repartition&#13;
6quitable du revenu. Ce processus de reforme n'a pas 6te continu. Les&#13;
changements intervenus dans la situation economique mondiale au cours des&#13;
ann6es 70 ont amene la Hongrie A modifier periodiquement son systeme de&#13;
gestion economique. Les responsables politiques de ce pays doivent&#13;
maintenant s'attaquer a un probleme complexe, qui est de mettre sur pied&#13;
une economie socialiste technologiquement avanc6e qui soit capable de&#13;
s'adapter rapidement A l'volution de la situation mondiale sur laquelle&#13;
elle nta pas prise, compte tenu des contraintes imposees par le systeme de&#13;
gestion 6conomique qui a ete choisi, et aussi de l'histoire, de la g6ogra-&#13;
phie et des ressources natifrelles de la Hongrie.&#13;
Le present document decrit les m6canismes actuels de prise de&#13;
decision economique A un niveau sup6rieur A celui des entreprises. Il&#13;
examine le r6le de la planification dans le systeme de gestion economique&#13;
hongrois, ainsi que quelques-uns des principaux "regulateurs 6conomiques"&#13;
utilises par les autorites pour inciter les entreprises A poursuivre les&#13;
objectifs macroeconomiques et sectoriels fix6s. Dans sa derniere partie,&#13;
ce document examine les trois dilemmes auxquels sont confrontes les&#13;
responsables hongrois.   Vaut-il mieux mettre en place un systeme suscep-&#13;
tible de s'adapter rapidement A l'volution du monde ext6rieur, au risque&#13;
de reduire la large participation A la prise des decisions sur laquelle&#13;
s'appuie le processus de reforme? La juste r6partition des revenus, qui&#13;
est consideree comme un des acquis majeurs de la soci6te socialiste&#13;
hongroise, doit-elle etre sacrifi6e au profit d'une efficacit6 economique&#13;
accrue? Faut-il poursuivre la politique de stabilisation A court terme de&#13;
l1'conomie, qui risque d'introduire certains elements d'incertitude dans&#13;
les decisions des entreprises en matiere d'investissement et eventuel-&#13;
lement de ralentir le processus de transformation des structures, pour&#13;
rendre 1 'conomie plus competitive A moyen terme? Le document conclut que&#13;
les trois dilemmes auxquels doivent faire face les responsables hongrois&#13;
sont lies entre eux et qu'une amelioration de la situation economique&#13;
internationale peut faciliter la recherche des solutions appropriees.&#13;

This study was prepared as a background paper for the World Bank's&#13;
first economic report on Hungary, titled, Hungary:   fconomic Developments and&#13;
Reforms. It is based on a mission to Hungary from May 27 through June 16, 1982.&#13;
In preparing this paper, I have drawn on information and analyses provided by&#13;
the Hungarian authorities, as well as data and analyses prepared by Hungarian&#13;
and nonHungarian students of the Hungarian economy and published in a variety&#13;
of journals and periodicals. A selection of this extensive literature is&#13;
included in the bibliography at the end of this study.&#13;
I would like to thank my fellow mission members--Gabriel Siri, Hazel&#13;
Denton, Javad Khalilzadeh Shirazi, David Caplin, Robert Hunt, Darrel Fallon-&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Since 1968, Hungary has attempted to combine central planning of the&#13;
economy with a significant decentralization of economic decision-making in&#13;
favor of productive enterprises. 1/ In pursuing this objective, Hungarian&#13;
economic authorites have increased their reliance on indirect controls&#13;
("economic regulators") and market forces, as opposed to central directives,&#13;
to guide the enterprises. At the same time, they have preserved a number of&#13;
the bureaucratic structures characteristic of more traditional socialist&#13;
economies and have maintained a strong commitment to equity. The reform&#13;
process has not been linear. Changes in the international economic environ-&#13;
ment have been accompanied by periodic and major modifications in the&#13;
Hungarian system of economic management.&#13;
Conceived as early as 1957, the decentralizing reforms were first&#13;
implemented in a systematic fashion beginning in 1968, after a period of&#13;
careful preparation involving considerable debate at the technical and&#13;
/   This term generally refers to state enterprises and cooperatives&#13;
(collectively known as socialist sector enterprises), but also includes&#13;
small-scale private businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

political levels. 1/ The process of economic restructuring envisaged by the&#13;
measures was to occur in a period of time when the world economy, in particu-&#13;
lar international trade, was growing rapidly, and when appropriate policies by&#13;
a small economy, such as that of Hungary, returned handsome economic dividends&#13;
in the form of more rapid economic growth and the expansion of its exports.&#13;
Underlying the reforms was the conviction of Hungary's leaders that greater&#13;
flexibility, innovation and efficiency in economic production were required&#13;
than could be achieved under the traditional forms of central planning.&#13;
Greater openness of the economy to the world market and its price structure&#13;
was seen as a necessary guide for enterprises. While state enterprises were&#13;
seen as the most appropriate form of economic organization for large-scale&#13;
mass production and foreign trade, cooperatives--with their greater flexi-&#13;
bility in shaping the pattern of production, relatively bolder opportunities&#13;
for risk-taking and democratic internal structures--were expected to play an&#13;
important complementary role in industry and services and a dominant one in&#13;
agriculture. Maintaining a small-scale private sector to complement the&#13;
For a brief account of the earliest Hungarian economic reforms in 1956,&#13;
the elaboration of a much more complete set of reforms in the first six&#13;
months of 1957 and the process leading to the 1968 reforms see Knight&#13;
(1983a), especially pages 63-66. A selection of English language&#13;
articles and books on the Hungarian economy is contained in the&#13;
bibliography to the present paper.&#13;

socialist sector was also considered desirable, particularly in services and&#13;
small-scale commodity production. I/&#13;
The 1968 reforms, often referred to as the New Economic Mechanism&#13;
(NEM), did not alter the ownership by the state of the means of production.&#13;
But they abolished the system of physical economic planning which had existed&#13;
prior to that time. Although the Plan continued to play an important role in&#13;
determining the broad direction of economic activity, the objectives of the&#13;
Plan were to be achieved through the use of economic regulators--including price&#13;
measures, and exchange rate, monetary and fiscal policies. These policies had&#13;
their principal direct impact on enterprises and their behavior and indirectly&#13;
on the rate of increase of real wages and the standard of living of the popu-&#13;
lation, and more generally, on the pace of economic activity. The reforms&#13;
placed increased emphasis on making enterprises responsive to market signals.&#13;
There was a partial freeing of prices of industrial producer, consumer, and,&#13;
to a lesser extent, of agricultural goods. Enterprises were given more&#13;
autonomy in deciding on wages and investments. Profitability became a more&#13;
important performance indicator than physical output while credit policies&#13;
became an important mechanism for ensuring the consistency of decisions taken&#13;
/   In 1980 state enterprises produced 63.5% of GDP, cooperatives operating&#13;
as enterprises 16.5%, and small private enterprises including households&#13;
producing agricultural goods on private plots 9.5%. The remaining 10.5%&#13;
was government services (10.4% provided by government agencies and&#13;
associations and 0.1% by cooperatives). The 9.5% of GDP originating in&#13;
private activities was divided between production on household plots of&#13;
cooperative members (3%), production on household plots of employees of&#13;
the state sector (4%) and production by small-scale private enterprises&#13;
(2.5%). This breakdown of GDP in 1980 was provided by the Hungarian&#13;
Central Statistical Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

by individual economic units and macro-economic objectives. In this process,&#13;
nevertheless, a number of bureaucratic structures were preserved and the&#13;
country maintained its strong commitment to equity. The reform process was&#13;
designed to increase the efficiency of economic management in a socialist&#13;
society.&#13;
The period 1968 to 1973 saw adaptations of the reform measures as the&#13;
authorities reacted to changing domestic and international economic condi-&#13;
tions. In general, the NEM accomplished by 1973 many of the important reform&#13;
objectives which had been envisaged for the first phase of its implementa-&#13;
tion. In particular, it succeeded in reducing the role of planning in&#13;
enterprise dcision-making and in increasing the role of prices (the major&#13;
mechanism of decentralization of decisions). The prices established in the&#13;
economy as a result of the NEM were substantially improved reflections of&#13;
resource costs when compared with those that had existed up to that time.&#13;
They also constituted a better basis for future realignments of Hungarian&#13;
prices with those in world markets--a task envisaged for further phases of the&#13;
reforms. But this period also saw a heavy focus on developments in the trade&#13;
balance, with insufficient attention being paid to the development of instru-&#13;
ments for the management of domestic demand, and a not fully satisfactory&#13;
appreciation of links between the growth of output and demand and the need for&#13;
imports in such a heavily trade-oriented economy as Hungary's. Thus, during&#13;
this period, the excess demand which characterizes traditional centrally&#13;
planned economies continued to exist.&#13;
In late 1972, however, the reform process was interrupted for what,&#13;
initially at least, were domestic reasons. It had led to shifts in income&#13;
distribution (arising from the earning of large bonuses by managers and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
increasing incomes earned by some workers in the burgeoning "second economy" 1/&#13;
and to modifications in job security, which were protested by segments of the&#13;
working class. These pressures led to a serious setback of the economic&#13;
reform. The authorities enhanced central controls over enterprise wage payments&#13;
and disposition of enterprise funds. Elements of recentralization appeared in&#13;
1972, and, as a consequence it negated some aspects of the NEM.&#13;
Between 1972 and 1978 there was a weakening in the role of prices in&#13;
economic decision-making. These developments had adverse consequences for&#13;
efficiency and for the trade balance. Acceleration of the rate of economic&#13;
growth, which characterized these years, was accompanied by massive recourse to&#13;
foreign borrowings to cover enlarged balance of payments deficits. But by 1978&#13;
there were already indications that centralization of decision-making and&#13;
attempted insulation of the economy from external shocks were not fully satis-&#13;
factory responses to the complexities of management of a trade-oriented&#13;
economy. It came to be recognized increasingly that the convertible currency&#13;
balance would become a binding constraint on the growth of the economy unless&#13;
there was a shift in economic policies. Future economic development would need&#13;
to be based more on improved productivity and faster technological development,&#13;
and less on quantitative increases in the productive factors. The best way to&#13;
further this approach, the authorities concluded, was to accelerate rather than&#13;
retard the reform process. Since 1979, there has been a resumption of the&#13;
process of economic reforms which had been initiated in 1968.&#13;
/   The "second economy" consists of a variety of small-scale activities in&#13;
farming, trade, industry, construction and services, including some semi-&#13;
legal and illegal activities in addition to the legal ones which are&#13;
captured in the national accounts estimate of private sector value added&#13;
(9.5% of GDP) given in the previous footnote.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
But this time even those elements of the international economic environ-&#13;
ment which had been favorable to Hungary--particularly the rapid expansion of&#13;
world trade in the 1970s and easy access to international capital markets--had&#13;
turned against it. The slower economic growth of industrialized countries, and&#13;
the accor,panying increases in protectionist tendencies, worked against the&#13;
expansion of Hungarian exports to these markets. Restrictions on transfers of&#13;
industrial technologies retarded the pace of manufacturing upgrading. The&#13;
Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries, which are Hungary's major&#13;
trading partners, were also experiencing marked slowdowns in economic activity;&#13;
as a result, Hungary has had difficulties in securing required supplies of raw&#13;
materials on which its productive structure is very dependent. The debt&#13;
servicing difficulties experienced by some CMEA countries have led to both a&#13;
marked reduction in availabilities, and a significant hardening in the terms of&#13;
borrowing by Hungary in international capital markets.&#13;
Hungarian policymakers now confront the complex task of developing a&#13;
technologically advanced socialist economy capable of adapting rapidly to&#13;
changing world economic conditions which it cannot control, within the context of&#13;
the constraints imposed by the economic management system which has been chosen,&#13;
and the country's history, geography and resource endowments. This task poses&#13;
three kinds of trade-offs which are analyzed in the final section (part V) of&#13;
this paper. Is it better to pursue a capability for rapid response to the&#13;
changing external environment at the cost of reducing the broad participation in&#13;
decision-making which has helped provide support for the reform process? Should&#13;
some of the marked equity in income distribution which is seen as a major&#13;
achievement of Hungarian socialist development be sacrificed in order to spur&#13;
greater economic efficiency? Must the imperatives of short-run macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization dictate rapid changes in the rules of the economic game facing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
individual enterprises at the cost of slowing the process of structural&#13;
transformation necessary to assure longer term competitiveness of the economy?&#13;
In order to better analyze the nature of these trade-offs or dilemmas,&#13;
part II describes the current economic decision-making structures above the&#13;
enterprise level, part III looks at the role of planning in the Hungarian&#13;
economic management system, and part IV examines some of the principal "economic&#13;
regulators" used by the economic authorities to influence enterprises in the&#13;
pursuit of planned macroeconomic and sectoral goals.&#13;
II. ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES&#13;
This section briefly describes the most important structures above the&#13;
enterprise level involved in economic decision-making--the legislative and&#13;
executive branches of government and the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party&#13;
(HSWP). Non-governmental interest groups, which have been playing an increas-&#13;
ingly important role, both formal and informal, and some general characteristics&#13;
of Hungarian economic decision-making processes, are also discussed.&#13;
The Structure of Economic Decision-Making&#13;
Economic decision-making is a responsibility exercised jointly by a wide&#13;
range of institutional actors. Most broadly they include the legislative and&#13;
executive branches of government, the HSWP (the sole political party), and&#13;
productive enterprises including state enterprises and cooperatives (jointly&#13;
known as socialist sector enterprises) as well as small-scale private&#13;
businesses. In addition, there are a number of important non-governmental&#13;
interest groups which represent labor, enterprises in general, different types of&#13;
cooperatives, professionals, small tradesmen, etc.&#13;
The linkages between these various institutions are extensive; they&#13;
continually interact with one another and many individuals are members of more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
than one institution, are elected by members of another institution, or are&#13;
ensured of consultation or actual involvement in the policymaking and decision--&#13;
making processes of several such institutions. This complex system helps promote&#13;
cooperation and consensus.&#13;
Together these institutions help shape the national economic plans which&#13;
serve as an indicative framework guiding all enterprises. But since the 1968&#13;
reforms, national economic plans no longer include the system of directives at&#13;
the enterprise level governing investment, product mix, output, and wages. This&#13;
approach has left enterprise managers with considerable autonomy to make economic&#13;
decisions that maximize profits. Socialist sector enterprises are free to devote&#13;
their profits, after deduction of taxes, various mandatory and voluntary reserves,&#13;
managerial bonuses, and debt service to either the "development fund," which may&#13;
be used to carry out new investments, or the "sharing fund" used to pay bonuses and&#13;
taxes on wage increases (beyond the tax-free increase as explained in part IV).&#13;
That the autonomy is real is manifested by the difficulties the economic&#13;
authorities have had in controlling the level of enterprise-initiated investment&#13;
and, more recently, the movement of wages, as will be explained below in the&#13;
section on the role of planning. Still, it is also true that the authorities&#13;
have constrained and sometimes virtually eliminated that freedom by manipulating&#13;
the economic regulators, by the impact of the substantial state investments of a&#13;
strategic nature which still accounted for 42% of investment in the socialist&#13;
sector in 1981 (this includes the investment of central and local government&#13;
agencies as well as state enterprises responsible for carrying out such planned&#13;
investments), CMEA agreements, and by the pressures state agencies have exerted&#13;
on enterprise managers.&#13;
Enterprises can and do seek to influence the institutions which&#13;
determine national economic plans and the working of the regulators used to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
influence their own behavior in a manner conducive to plan fulfillment. But this&#13;
section looks at key decision-making structures above the enterprise level and at&#13;
the relationships among them.&#13;
Government&#13;
The key governmental institutions are the legislative branch, which&#13;
elects a Council of Ministers, and the executive branch, which consists of the&#13;
Council of Ministers and the several ministries and other state agencies&#13;
responsible for economic affairs. Also integral to economic decision-making,&#13;
particularly at the enterprise level, are the local levels of government, which&#13;
play an important role in the provision of housing and employment services as&#13;
well as the normal functions of government at this level.&#13;
The Legislative Branch: The legislative branch consists of a modified&#13;
unicameral form of government. Members of Parliament are elected from some 350&#13;
single-member districts. Candidates are nominated in open meetings at the&#13;
district level, with proposals coming either from the Patriotic Front, a broad&#13;
political grouping dominated by the HSWP, or from the floor. In proposing&#13;
nominees, an attempt is made to insure representation in Parliament of the major&#13;
economic, ethnic, religious, and professional groups, as well as a balance of sex&#13;
and age. While in most districts only one candidate is proposed, there has been&#13;
a trend toward presentation of two or more candidates and many members of&#13;
Parliament are not HSWP members.&#13;
The Parliament is divided into a large number of committees which can&#13;
hold hearings, make field visits, and request testimony of government offi-&#13;
cials. There are four economic committees: Planning and Finance, Industry,&#13;
Agriculture, and Commerce. There is also a 21-person Presidential Council, which&#13;
the Parliament elects from among its members. This body has important powers--&#13;
those of appointment to other branches of government, of treaty-making, and of&#13;
declaring a state of emergency, as well as the right to exercise, between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
sessions of Parliament, all parliamentary powers other than amending the&#13;
Constitution.&#13;
The Executive Branch: The Council of Ministers heads the executive&#13;
branch. It has two key economic committees, the State Planning Committee and the&#13;
Economic Committee, each headed by a Deputy Prime Minister (see Figure 1). The&#13;
first of these deals with long-term economic development issues: it must approve&#13;
national economic plans, the state budget, major changes in the economic&#13;
regulators, and major state investments. Its chairman is also head of the&#13;
National Planning Office, a ministerial post within the Council. Although the&#13;
State Planning Committee has a three-person secretariat, in practice the National&#13;
Planning Office serves as the staff for the committee.&#13;
The Economic Committee, headed by a Deputy Prime Minister, is charged&#13;
with managing the day-to-day operations of the state agencies which carry out the&#13;
national economic plans. It also directs Hungary's international economic&#13;
relations (including the CMEA agreements); and directs the system of material&#13;
flows. The Secretariat for International Economic Relations, also under the&#13;
Council of Ministers and headed by a Deputy Minister, serves as the staff for the&#13;
Economic Committee. Decisions of both the State Planning Committee and the&#13;
Economic Committee are subject to approval by the full Council of Ministers.&#13;
(See Annex 1 for a list of the voting members and permanent invitees of both&#13;
committees.)&#13;
Also under the Council of Ministers are two central ministries--the&#13;
National Planning Office and the Ministry of Finance--and six other branch&#13;
economic ministries (see Figure 1).&#13;
At the next level of the executive branch come six important national&#13;
economic agencies: the National Bank of Hungary, the Central Statistical&#13;
Office, the National Board for Materials and Prices, the State Office for&#13;
Labor and Wages, the National Committee for Technical Development, and the&#13;

aforementioned Secretariat for International Economic Relations. The National&#13;
Bank of Hungary is the central bank as well as the most important source of&#13;
credit to help finance enterprise-initiated investments. The State&#13;
Development Bank is closely connected to the Ministry of Finance, since its&#13;
principal role is to finance state investments. Similarly, the Hungarian&#13;
Foreign Trade Bank Limited has close ties with the Ministry of Foreign Trade&#13;
and the National Savings Bank with the Ministry of Housing, Public Construc-&#13;
tion, and Town Development.&#13;
Government at the Local Level: At the local level, Hungary is&#13;
divided into Budapest (the capital), 19 counties, towns, and communities. The&#13;
counties are subdivided into county districts, while Budapest and the larger&#13;
cities are subdivided into urban districts. Budapest, the counties, the&#13;
districts of Budapest and the larger cities, the towns and the communities&#13;
elect their own local councils for five-year terms. These councils may pass&#13;
decrees or resolutions covering their jurisdictions so long as there is no&#13;
conflict with legislation, decrees, and rulings from a higher level of&#13;
government.&#13;
The Hungarian Socialist Workers Party (HSWP)&#13;
The HSWP, the sole political party, plays a central, integrative role&#13;
between the legislative and executive branches of government, as well as&#13;
between the government and Hungarian society, including a number of important&#13;
non-governmental interest groups. Among these are the National Council of&#13;
Trade Unions, the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce, the National Council for&#13;
Agricultural Cooperatives, the National Union of Industrial Cooperatives, and&#13;
the National Association of Small Tradesmen.&#13;
About 1 in every 10 Hungarians is a party member. As a rule of&#13;
thumb, the percentage of party members rises as one moves from the bottom to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
the top level within enterprises, government organizations, and interest&#13;
groups, even though there is no rule that any particular position must be held&#13;
by a party member. In fact, it is quite common for top technical and mana-&#13;
gerial positions in state enterprises, government agencies, cooperatives and&#13;
interest groups to be occupied by people who are not HSWP members. The&#13;
general principle is that major policy should be set by the HSWP, but the&#13;
implementation of the policies should be the responsibility of the&#13;
professionals chosen for their technical competence.&#13;
Overall, the structure of the HSWP is that of a multi-layered pyramid&#13;
(see Figure 2). The primary organizational base of the HSWP is the workplace,&#13;
although there is also an organization by place of residence. In large&#13;
enterprises, the basic unit may be smaller than the enterprise as a whole; for&#13;
example, it may be a department. At the top is the Party Congress, which&#13;
meets every five years. Each level elects its own committees and officials&#13;
(the highest being the First Secretary) as well as delegates to the next&#13;
level. All elections are held by secret ballot. The party organizations in&#13;
the 19 counties and Budapest elect the delegates to the Party Congress. The&#13;
Party Congresses set the major areas of policy including economic policy.&#13;
Between Congresses a Central Committee serves as the top deliberative&#13;
body. It has 127 members, elected by the party Congress. Normally the&#13;
Central Committee meets four or five times a year with the sessions lasting&#13;
one or two days.&#13;
The Central Committee in turn elects several committees from among&#13;
its members. The most important formal committee is the Political Committee&#13;
(Politburo), composed of 11-13 people, which deals with major political&#13;
questions and meets as the need arises. An informal committee, the Economic&#13;
Policy Committee, plays a key role in developing new economic policies and&#13;

"selling" them within the Party structure. Another key institution of the&#13;
Central Committee is its Secretariat, composed of six Central Committee&#13;
members who are elected by the full Central Committee, plus a large supporting&#13;
staff. The staff is divided into several departments whose heads are&#13;
appointed by the Central Committee. The staff is the bureaucratic structure&#13;
charged with executing Party policy and overseeing Party operations.&#13;
One of the Secretariat's departments is the Economic Policy&#13;
Department, composed of some 50-60 professionals. The staff or director of&#13;
this unit attend many meetings in the executive branch of government. For&#13;
example, the director is a permanent invitee to the meetings of both the State&#13;
Planning Committee and the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers.&#13;
The Economic Decision-Making Process&#13;
The most important principle underlying economic decision-making in&#13;
Hungary is to make sure that all relevant government agencies and non-&#13;
governmental interest groups have an opportunity to make their views known at&#13;
each stage of decision-making. It is explicitly recognized that there are and&#13;
will always be different interests within socialist society. By providing&#13;
institutional mechanisms for the expression and confrontation of differing&#13;
views, it is believed that there is greater opportunity to achieve mutual&#13;
understanding and consensus. Even when that is not possible, a greater&#13;
commitment to the final decision is more likely because all parties will have&#13;
had an opportunity to present their case.&#13;
As an example, major state investments--those that are of a very&#13;
large size or are of importance to the entire economy though they perhaps are&#13;
not as large as some enterprise-initiated investments--ultimately must be&#13;
approved by the Council of Ministers. Before that stage, however, there is an&#13;
initial review by the State Development Bank, with extensive involvement by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
its economic and project staff and the active participation of the relevant&#13;
branch ministry, 1/ and by the National Planning Office, the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Internal Trade, the&#13;
Ministry of Housing, Public Construction and Town Development, the National&#13;
Bank of Hungary, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the National Committee on&#13;
Technical Development, the National Prices and Materials Board, and the&#13;
relevant trading companies. At each stage of the review process, the&#13;
executing enterprise must indicate explicitly which opinions it received from&#13;
agencies participating in the review it did not incorporate in the revised&#13;
proposal. (See Annex 2, Part A for a more complete description of the&#13;
decision-making process for major state investments.)&#13;
Likewise, in formulating wage and employment policy, the State Office&#13;
for Labor and Wages must work closely with the Secretariat of the National&#13;
Council of Trade Unions (NCTU) and with a new advisory committee, the Council&#13;
for Wages and Labor Affairs. The latter includes representatives of the&#13;
national associations of cooperatives (agriculture, industrial, and trading),&#13;
the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce, the National Planning Office, the Ministry&#13;
of Finance, and the branch ministries. Other interest groups or government&#13;
agencies may be invited when a matter of interest to them is being discussed,&#13;
and any governmental decision which will result in a legal rule governing&#13;
employment, wages, and social insurance must be discussed in this Council.&#13;
The minutes of the relevant meetings must be provided to the Council of&#13;
Ministers and its economic committees so that the ministers will be aware of&#13;
the opinions of interest groups when they take decisions. (Greater detail on&#13;
The branch ministries are Industry; Agriculture and Food; Transport and&#13;
Communications; and Housing, Public Construction and Town Development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
the decision-making structures and processes for wage and employment policy&#13;
can be found in Annex 3.)&#13;
Despite its advantages, this style of decision-making is by its&#13;
nature rather cumbersome and thus has a cost in terms of the speed with which&#13;
responses can be made in an uncertain and fast-changing environment. A major&#13;
issue for Hungary as well as other countries is how to maximize the political&#13;
and economic benefits of wide participation in decision-making while mini-&#13;
mizing the costs. The problem is, however, particularly severe for Hungary.&#13;
Because its economy is so dependent on foreign trade 1/ and its non-&#13;
agricultural natural resource base is limited, Hungary needs to be able to&#13;
respond quickly to the rapid changes in the external economic and political&#13;
environment.&#13;
There is also a danger that when economic decision-making is the&#13;
result of compromise among various state agencies and interest groups, the&#13;
final decision reached in interministerial committees may be one with which&#13;
none of the agencies involved is fully identified, perhaps not even the&#13;
executing enterprise in the case of major investments. In such cases it is&#13;
also difficult to fix responsibility for success or failure on an enterprise&#13;
or its management. Further, when the top levels of government assume collec-&#13;
tive responsibility for industrial, agricultural or commercial development&#13;
decisions of uncertain outcome, there is a strong temptation for the economic&#13;
authorities to intervene through manipulation of "economic regulators" to&#13;
assure the financial "success" of specific enterprises.&#13;

III. THE ROLE OF PLANNING&#13;
Since the 1968 reforms, the national economic plans serve as an&#13;
indicative framework guiding all enterprises. The plans no longer include&#13;
physical input allocations, output targets, product mix specifications,&#13;
investment allocations, and wage directives at the level of the individual&#13;
enterprise. This has left enterprise managers with considerable autonomy to&#13;
make economic decisions. Plans, and the accompanying budgets, however,&#13;
continue to be the instruments determining state investments. State invest-&#13;
ments, as discussed earlier, are principally for large projects for the&#13;
development of the infrastructure and natural resources (including energy and&#13;
mining). Besides this direct impact, the budget plays a role which permeates&#13;
all aspects of Hungarian economic life, because of the existence of a wide&#13;
range of taxes and subsidies. The quantitative significance of the state&#13;
budget is indicated by the fact that state expenditures represented 60% of GDP&#13;
in 1980 (a level virtually unchanged from that of 1975).&#13;
The central element of the Hungarian national planning system is the&#13;
National Planning Office (NPO). The NPO organizes and supervises the&#13;
elaboration of national plans and their coordination with the planning organs&#13;
of CMEA states. It prepares three types of plan: (a) long-term perspective&#13;
plans (currently through the year 2000); (b) five-year plans (currently for&#13;
1981-85, and (c) annual (operational) plans. The medium-term plan is at the&#13;
center of the planning process as it determines the principal objectives of&#13;
economic policy and the major economic tasks, including structural changes.&#13;
Specifically it provides for the:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(1) rate of growth of national income and the proportions of its major&#13;
components;&#13;
(2) development of the branches of the national economy and major&#13;
structural changes in production;&#13;
(3) principal trends in scientific and technical development policy;&#13;
(4) volume of investments and their allocation, including the principal&#13;
targets to be achieved;&#13;
(5) targets for employment, consumption, and real incomes of the&#13;
population;&#13;
(6) development of social, health, and cultural services and housing and&#13;
public utilities;&#13;

The process of preparing the national economic plans involves itera-&#13;
tive interactions between the NPO, the economic ministries and other national&#13;
economic agencies, the major interest groups, the socialist sector enter-&#13;
prises, trade unions and the HSWP. To correspond with the planning cycle, the&#13;
HSWP congresses are held in the year prior to the beginning of each five-year&#13;
plan; the National Congress of Trade Unions is currently switching from a&#13;
four- to a five-year cycle to facilitate systematic participation by the trade&#13;
unions in the planning process.&#13;
Five-year plans and annual budgets are approved by Parliament and&#13;
have the force of law; annual plans are only approved by the Council of&#13;

Ministers and therefore do not have legal force. Enterprises formulate their&#13;
own plans within the framework of the national plans. The state influences&#13;
the implementation of enterprise plans primarily through the manipulation of&#13;
indirect "economic regulators" such as taxes and subsidies, interest rates,&#13;
selective credit through the banking system, wage regulation, exchange rate&#13;
policy, and price policy. (The role of some of these regulators is discussed&#13;
in greater detail in Section IV below.) The principal guidelines for the&#13;
application of these regulators are set forth in the five-year plan, but in&#13;
practice the authorities have frequently altered the regulators in pursuit of&#13;
short-term objectives (for example, see pages 49 and 50 below).&#13;
Two major areas in which the central authorities have never ceased to&#13;
exercise direct intervention involve (a) actions (including the provision of&#13;
subsidies) to ensure fulfillment of international commitments, for example,&#13;
some agreements within the CMEA and voluntary export restraint agreements, and&#13;
(b) state investments. Between 1970 and 1980, state investments averaged&#13;
roughly 45% of all (state plus enterprise-initiated) investment (see Table 1);&#13;
the socialist sector, in turn, accounted for 90% of total investment. State&#13;
investments are classified into three categories. The first is "large"&#13;
investments, which are major projects of importance to the entire economy.&#13;
Central funds provided through the State Development Bank finance most of each&#13;
project, but enterprise funds are also involved; increasingly the funding is&#13;
taking the form of repayable loans rather than grants. Such projects are&#13;
often in mining, energy, transportation or the production of key raw materials&#13;
and intermediate inputs. Second are "aim-grouped" investments, which are made&#13;
with funds distributed to ministries and local councils for projects in&#13;
certain categories, for example highways and hospitals. Finally there are&#13;

"other" state investments, mostly for small projects of local significance or&#13;
minor investments by ministries.&#13;
The proportion of the three types of state investment remained&#13;
roughly constant at about 14, 21, and 10% of total socialist sector investment&#13;
for "large," "aim-grouped," and "other" respectively from 1970 to 1980. In&#13;
1981, investment was sharply reduced overall. The share of state investment&#13;
fell to 42%, and the composition was changed in favor of "other" and against&#13;
"aim-grouped" and "large" investments.   The cutbacks were achieved by either&#13;
delaying the completion of projects underway or by not starting planned&#13;
projects. Export promotion and energy rationalization are the priority areas&#13;
for investments.&#13;
Table 2 provides an overview of the trends in the plan aggregates&#13;
since 1971. During the 1970s, there was a persistent tendency for investment&#13;
to increase faster than the planned level, while consumption grew more slowly&#13;
than planned. Compared to investment, consumption has tended to play a rela-&#13;
tively passive role, being restrained by the system of wage regulation at the&#13;
enterprise level and by a controlled increase in the rate of inflation (see&#13;
Section IV below). However, since 1978, the share of consumption in GDP has&#13;
risen as investment has been held back. The government's strong commitment to&#13;
maintaining living standards, which was written into the 1981-85 five-year&#13;
plan, has placed an important constraint on the ability of the economic&#13;
authorities to reduce domestic absorption by cutting consumption. Indeed, the&#13;
authorities have been confronted with a problem--in 1981 both real private&#13;
consumption and wages increased faster than planned, a situation which sug-&#13;
gests that the system of wage and price regulation was not fully successful in&#13;
the face of the greater than expected liquidity of enterprises.&#13;

Table 3 shows the actual annual investment in the socialist sector in&#13;
relation to planned annual investments year-by-year for the period 1970-81,&#13;
broken out by state and enterprise-initiated investments. The essence of the&#13;
problem does not appear to lie with the state investments--they exceeded the&#13;
plan in only 5 years and averaged 2.7% below the plan for the entire period,&#13;
with the most dramatic shortfall in 1981, when they were 21.6% below plan. In&#13;
fact, since 1974, state investment has been held below the plan in five out of&#13;
eight years in an apparent effort to compensate for the above-plan level of&#13;
the enterprise-initiated investments. Rather, the heart of the investment&#13;
problem is the inability of the economic authorities to control enterprise-&#13;
initiated investments. These exceeded the annual plan in 11 out of 12 years,&#13;
averaging 13.5% above the annual plan level, and accounted for roughly 55% of&#13;
the socialist sector investment over the 1970s.&#13;
More than half (since 1976, a steadily increasing proportion that&#13;
reached 69% in 1981) of such investments have been financed by the enterprises&#13;
from their own resources (retained profits and depreciation allowances). Most&#13;
of the remainder was financed by credits from the National Bank of Hungary&#13;
(NBH) and, to a lesser extent, from the State Development Bank (SDB, see&#13;
Chapter 7). The rather dramatic increase in the share of enterprise-initiated&#13;
investments financed from their own resources suggests a growing autonomy by&#13;
enterprises in investment decision-making, consistent with the objectives of&#13;
the reform process.&#13;
A similar trend is suggested by a comparison of the national develop-&#13;
ment plans for 1976-80 and 1981-85. They show a clear move toward less detail&#13;
on specific physical targets and more language that explicitly recognizes that&#13;
the plan may have to be revised in the light of developments in the world&#13;

economy and the efficiency of domestic production. Further, at the end of&#13;
1980, the three ministries that controlled the industrial sector at that time&#13;
were consolidated into a single one, the Ministry of Industry, with half the&#13;
total number of staff. Then in 1981, the Ministry of Labor was disbanded and&#13;
replaced by the State Office for Labor and Wages, with less than 40% of the&#13;
former staff. These structural changes have reduced the ability of the&#13;
central state to intervene directly in enterprise affairs.&#13;
It must be noted, however, that the autonomy of the state enterprises&#13;
remains strongly limited by the fact that they are owned by the very state&#13;
which regulates them. Their managers are appointed by the branch ministries,&#13;
which evaluate their performance. 1/ The wages they can pay are limited by&#13;
centrally determined rules. The prices they pay for inputs or earn for their&#13;
outputs is sometimes determined by the National Board for Materials and Prices.&#13;
And their investment plans frequently require external finance, which is&#13;
provided almost exclusively by the two major state banks. Cooperatives on the&#13;
other hand, have considerably more autonomy, private enterprises still more.&#13;
IV. THE ROLE OF ECONOMIC REGULATORS&#13;
A better understanding of the problems Hungarian authorities face in&#13;
achieving consistency between their macroeconomic and microeconomic objectives&#13;
requires an analysis of how the system of economic regulators works. A wide&#13;
variety of economic regulators used to influence the behavior of enterprises&#13;
Beginning in 1983 a scheme whereby managers apply for fixed-term&#13;
appointments is to be used more frequently. In the evaluation of enter-&#13;
prise performance as well as that of its senior management, supervisory&#13;
committees including representatives of branch ministries, banks,&#13;
experts, and sectoral trade union representatives are being used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
and consumers. They include price regulation, exchange rates, tariffs, taxes,&#13;
subsidies, credit policy, rules governing the use of enterprise income, and&#13;
rules on the formation of labor income. Manipulation of these regulators is a&#13;
major means by which the government seeks to implement national economic plans&#13;
and control the level of aggregate demand. However, the same tools also allow&#13;
ample opportunity to "soften" the budget constraints individual firms face and&#13;
thus to reduce the guidance of the marketplace (Kornai, 1980b). In practice,&#13;
the large size and powerful connections of many Hungarian enterprises allows&#13;
them to influence the institutions which determine regulator policy and some-&#13;
times to bargain with the authorities regarding the application of regulators.&#13;
This section reviews the general institutional framework and broad&#13;
policy lines governing price, credit, enterprise income, and wages and&#13;
personal income regulations. For information on tariffs and exchange rate&#13;
policies see Maher (1982) and World Bank (1983). World Bank (1983) also pro-&#13;
vides additional information on credit policy and Maher (1982) provides a&#13;
detailed examination of price policy.    World Bank (1983) also provides many&#13;
examples of the working of regulators in the agriculture, industry and energy&#13;
sectors.&#13;
Price Regulation&#13;
Prior to 1968, prices served mainly an accounting function. National&#13;
and enterprise plans were denominated in physical units. Decisions on trade&#13;
were made centrally and passed, by directives, to the Ministries and on to the&#13;
enterprises. Prices were set on a cost-plus basis, did not attempt to reflect&#13;
supply and demand, and were separated from relative world prices. The lack of&#13;
signals from scarcity prices and profit incentives often led to poor&#13;
investment decisions, and a concentration of trade within the CMEA, where&#13;
prices were negotiated and competitive quality of lesser importance than in&#13;
world markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
The 1968 reforms placed increased emphasis on making enterprises&#13;
responsive to market signals. Prices were intended to reflect market demand&#13;
and state preferences: while prices for most consumer goods and key produc-&#13;
tion inputs remained tightly controlled (about 75% of consumer goods and 30%&#13;
of producer goods), the rest became "free" prices set by the enterprises,&#13;
albeit under detailed guidelines elaborated by the National Board for&#13;
Materials and Prices (NBMP). Central allocation of materials was also dis-&#13;
mantled in 1968, although initially certain materials, semi-manufactures, and&#13;
foodstuffs remained subject to quotas.&#13;
The intention of the reformers was to extend the scope of market&#13;
forces in determining both producer and consumer prices. In the first few&#13;
years after the 1968 reforms there was consistent progress. But government&#13;
policy also aimed at keeping consumer prices stable. The two objectives&#13;
proved incompatible. The deterioration in Hungary's terms of trade, starting&#13;
in 1974, provided an opportunity for those who favored a more centralized&#13;
model of economic decision-making to reassert their ascendancy on economic&#13;
questions. An extensive system of taxes and subsidies on trade was used to&#13;
reduce the impact of foreign inflation on domestic prices. The structure of&#13;
domestic producer prices became increasingly isolated from world market prices&#13;
and reflected increased interventions on an industry-by-industry and firm-by-&#13;
firm basis. The scope of quantitative regulations (purchase quotas and&#13;
central allocations) also increased. Production taxes, set on a firm-by-firm&#13;
basis, were used increasingly, while enterprises which considered themselves&#13;
adversely affected by central interventions bargained for budgetary sub-&#13;
sidies. To limit increases in consumer prices, the rise in domestic producer&#13;
prices was not fully transmitted to consumer prices. Consumers thus had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
little incentive to adjust their consumption patterns to changes in world&#13;
market prices, particularly in the case of petroleum products. Nor were&#13;
producers induced to save energy, so an energy-intensive pattern of production&#13;
was maintained in agriculture as well as manufacturing (see World Bank, 1983).&#13;
The 1979-80 reforms included a number of changes in price regulations&#13;
to help achieve the major objective of rationalizing the use of inputs in&#13;
production and making enterprises more efficient. The changes included&#13;
measures to link domestic and international prices more closely, to reverse&#13;
the prevailing negative relationship between consumer and producer prices&#13;
which had developed during the 1970s, to introduce greater flexibility in&#13;
prices and to provide greater scope for enterprises in price setting. But&#13;
general guidelines exist for overall increases in medium-term and annual plans&#13;
and considerable supervisory control is exercised.&#13;
The National Board for Materials and Prices (NBMP)&#13;
The agency charged with coordinating price regulation and the&#13;
organization of markets is the NBMP. It has a professional staff of about&#13;
200, organized into 5 departments covering different branches of the economy&#13;
and 5 functionally specialized departments (see Figure 3). Its President has&#13;
the rank of Secretary of State, is a member of the Economic Committee, and a&#13;
permanent invitee of the State Planning Committee. The NBMP works closely&#13;
with the branch ministries, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of&#13;
Domestic Trade, and the Ministry of Finance. Any measures affecting state&#13;
revenues or expenditures (i.e., taxes or subsidies) require the agreement of&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. Major changes in price policy must be reviewed by&#13;
the Economic Committee prior to submission to the Council of Ministers.&#13;
Guidelines for price policy and market organization must be proposed&#13;
by the NBMP while the national economic plans are being formulated and must be&#13;

approved by the State Planning Committee. Most price increases by socialist&#13;
sector enterprises must be announced to the NBMP. Within 20 days after such&#13;
notification, the NBMP may object to the price increase or suspend it for up&#13;
to 6 months if measures to avoid adverse side effects are judged necessary.&#13;
According to a December 1980 regulation of the Council of Ministers,&#13;
that sets forth the tasks and sphere of authority of the NBMP, its President&#13;
may assign some of its tasks of market supervision to other ministries or&#13;
national organizations with their consent. This provision has been utilized&#13;
to share the tasks of price and market regulation in their respective spheres&#13;
with the Ministries of Agriculture and Food and Transport and Communica-&#13;
tions. This kind of cooperation does not take place with the Ministry of&#13;
Industry, however, and is one of the ways in which the new Ministry of&#13;
Industry's ability to intervene in the affairs of industrial enterprises was&#13;
curtailed. Regulation of the utilization of energy is accomplished through&#13;
the National Energy Authority, while the Ministry of Domestic Trade works&#13;
closely with the NBMP on issues connected with trade in consumer goods.&#13;
To promote the efficient working of markets, the NBMP is charged with&#13;
the management of central buffer stocks, registration of stocks belonging to&#13;
enterprises, and making recommendations for the improvement of marketing and&#13;
the control and/or breaking up of monopolies. In this last capacity, the&#13;
Board can recommend the establishment of small- and middle-sized companies or&#13;
the breaking up of larger units, including trusts. The NBMP is specifically&#13;
charged with promoting "reasonable" economic competition in the goods&#13;
markets. In recent years a number of trusts have been broken up and new&#13;
enterprises formed (World Bank, 1983).&#13;

The 1979-80 Price Reforms and Recent Developments&#13;
In preparation for the major price reform which became effective on&#13;
January 1, 1980, a single large-scale increase in consumer prices, partially&#13;
compensated by a tapered wage adjustment, was introduced in July 1979. This&#13;
had the effect of raising the consumer price index by 9% in 1979 and again in&#13;
1980 (as compared with 4% between 1976 and 1978). These price measures, which&#13;
were designed to establish a level of consumer prices higher than that of&#13;
producer prices, were accompanied by a number of modifications of tax policy&#13;
for the same purpose. Production taxes were curtailed, falling from 8.9% of&#13;
GDP in 1979 to 5.1% in 1980. Capital taxes, which form part of production&#13;
costs, were virtually eliminated, falling from 4.5% of GDP in 1979 to 0.3% in&#13;
1980. However, the institution of a producers' turnover tax (mostly on&#13;
petroleum and raw materials from CMEA countries) which did not exist in 1979,&#13;
but was 9.9% of GDP in 1980 and 11.1% of GDP in 1981, more than compensated&#13;
for the loss in revenues from production and capital taxes, while serving as&#13;
an incentive to energy saving.&#13;
The 1979-80 price reforms introduced the concept of "competitive&#13;
prices," that is producer prices whch are linked with world markets either&#13;
directly through actual export and import prices or indirectly through&#13;
specific rules and regulations. The changes which were put in place were&#13;
designed to provide incentives for the rationalization of the use of inputs in&#13;
production and for improvements in efficiency. The regulation of consumer&#13;
prices is one of the two principal tools used by the authorities to affect the&#13;
real incomes of the population; the other is the regulation of wages. If&#13;
1/   This Section draws heavily on World Bank (1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
enterprise autonomy, within the guidelines established by the wage regula-&#13;
tions, results in an increase in incomes judged inconsistent with macro-&#13;
economic demand management, the authorities may opt to influence consumer&#13;
prices by varying the turnover tax which is good-specific and can be negative&#13;
for goods deemed critical in maintaining living standards.&#13;
In industry, the price system introduced in 1980 was based on the&#13;
following principles. Domestic prices of energy--which are subject to&#13;
official regulation--were adjusted to world market prices. If purchases of&#13;
energy are made by Hungary at prices which are below world market prices, the&#13;
difference is collected in the form of a so-called differential producers'&#13;
turnover tax. Domestic prices of raw and basic materials are established on&#13;
the basis of export or import prices depending on whether Hungary exports or&#13;
imports the particular commodity from the convertible currency area. Enter-&#13;
prises are permitted to form a price difference reserve fund which would&#13;
enable them to adjust rationally to changing international prices. Resources&#13;
for the fund arise from the difference between the calculated and actual&#13;
pruchase price; this fund is exempt from taxation.&#13;
Manufacturing enterprises which have significant exports (exceeding&#13;
5% of domestic sales) to the convertible currency area, are required to estab-&#13;
lish their domestic prices in such a way that the level of price increase and&#13;
profitability--based on a one-year review period--should not exceed those&#13;
actually obtained for exports to the convertible currency area.    Since 1968,&#13;
the calculation of export profitability has been based on a simple formula&#13;
which divides the forint cost of exports by actual convertible currency export&#13;
earnings (that is, the domestic cost of earning a unit of foreign exchange).&#13;
About two-thirds of industrial enterprises fall under this pricing princi-&#13;
ple. Other enterprises use the traditional price-setting tools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
In 1981 and 1982, modifications were made to the pricing rules&#13;
applicable to manufacturing enterprises. These changes, in the context of the&#13;
authorities' exports drive, were designed to avert the possibility either that&#13;
enterprises might withhold from export markets products with low profitability&#13;
in order to avoid lowering their average profit margins, or that some firms&#13;
might withhold exports from the market in order to avoid reaching the 5%&#13;
trigger ratio. Accordingly, firms which registered export growth rates in&#13;
excess of specified threshold levels were exempted from the requirement to&#13;
lower domestic prices so that average profit margins on domestic sales were&#13;
equal to those on exports.&#13;
The effective linking of domestic prices of inputs with their&#13;
international prices should contribute to efficiency in input utilization and&#13;
assist the process of structural transformation. For this to be fully&#13;
effective, however, it is necessary that the impact of these price changes be&#13;
fully reflected in measured enterprise profitability. Because of the&#13;
existence of a wide range of subsidies, it is not clear that this is yet the&#13;
case. Similarly, the principle of linking domestic prices of industrial&#13;
commodities with their international counterparts is a move in the right&#13;
direction. It is evident, however, that there are practical problems in the&#13;
application of the principle. The problems arise in part from the diffi-&#13;
culties in arriving at a strict concordance between a domestically produced&#13;
commodity--for example an article of clothing or a specialized machinery&#13;
item--and a comparable internationally traded commodity and its price. In&#13;
part, difficulties arise from accounting conventions which are to be applied&#13;
to compute the profitability of exports. Both of these factors lead to&#13;
bargaining on a case-by-case basis between the controlling authorities and&#13;
enterprises. The price system under which enterprises operate thus becomes as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
much a function of their bargaining skills as it is of objective economic&#13;
criteria. Finally, as will be discussed below, the existence of a wide range&#13;
of subsidies and taxes constitutes a major intervention in the price system,&#13;
and makes measured profitability an unreliable indicator of either financial&#13;
or economic performance. The authorities have intervened to prevent enter-&#13;
prises from making what are considered to be "excessive" profits. The lack of&#13;
precision of the measurement of profitability might result in the unfortunate&#13;
penalizing of precisely the more efficient and profitable enterprises whose&#13;
rapid development is necessary for structural transformation of the economy.&#13;
By the same token, inefficient firms, whose reorganization or demise may be&#13;
necessary in the structural transformation process, may continue to survive&#13;
and even thrive.&#13;
In agriculture, a dual price system came into existence in 1957 and&#13;
has continued since then. The country's social objectives have found expres-&#13;
sion in an extensive system of subsidies for both agricultural inputs and&#13;
outputs. Despite the fact that there have been significant increases in food&#13;
prices for consumers in 1980 and since then, agricultural prices remain below&#13;
both domestic producer and international prices of the same commodities. A&#13;
comparison of aggregate farmgate prices in US dollars and US dollar interna-&#13;
tional commodity prices in 1968-81 indicates that the latter increased at a&#13;
rate which was one percentage point above that of Hungarian farmgate prices.&#13;
The year-to-year changes were often of the same magnitude, although the inter-&#13;
national index declined in four years whereas prices in forint terms show&#13;
growth at a much lower rate of 3.9% a year. From one year to the next,&#13;
farmgate prices are adjusted to reflect production costs. The lower growth&#13;
rate of domestic prices compared to international prices reflects the general&#13;
policy of keeping farmgate prices as low and stable as possible while adjust-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
ing the relevant regulators (mainly premiums, subsidies, profits distribution&#13;
and access to enterprise investment funds) to adjust profitability. As a&#13;
result of this the bulk of agricultural prices suffer from some form or the&#13;
other of regulation.&#13;
The 1979-80 price reforms resulted in increases in the proportions of&#13;
both producer and consumer prices which were freely established. While in&#13;
1979, 57% of producer prices and 45% of consumer prices were freely estab-&#13;
lished, in 1980 these proportions had increased to 67% and 55% respectively.&#13;
Among the producer pricing categories, 100% of prices in metallurgy, engineer-&#13;
ing, light manufacturing, food industry and trade were free; while, only 7% of&#13;
energy, 10% of transport and communications, and 13% of construction prices&#13;
were free. Consumer prices are either "fixed", "flexible within officially&#13;
set limits" or "free"; in 1980, these categories represented 16%, 29%, and 55%&#13;
respectively of consumer prices. In 1980, again, the proportions of food,&#13;
beverages and tobacco prices falling into the above three categories were 23%,&#13;
49%, and 28% respectively. On the other hand, 100% of fuels prices were in&#13;
the "flexible" category and 100% of prices of glass and ceramics, handicrafts,&#13;
and products from free markets were in the "free" category.&#13;
As earlier indicated, the 1980 price reforms also had as their&#13;
objective the reversal of the negative differential of 4-6% between producer&#13;
and consumer prices. It was envisaged that in 1980 the positive differential&#13;
was of only 1.5% and in 1981 it dropped to 0.5% but rose to 2.5% in 1982. In&#13;
addition to subsidies for household energy consumption, the other major&#13;
consumer subsidies are for transport and rents.&#13;
Consumer price subsidies increased between 1979 and 1981 from 6.4% of&#13;
GDP to 8% of GDP. This rapid increase in consumer subsidies was largely the&#13;
result of the authorities' decision to mitigate the effects on consumers of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
the alignment of domestic energy prices with those prevailing in international&#13;
markets. It should be noted that the softening of prices of energy in inter-&#13;
national markets will not necessarily be a boon to Hungary. Under the&#13;
Bucharest principle for pricing goods in intra-CMEA trade, prices of energy&#13;
imports will be increasing rapidly in the medium-term, and this will impose a&#13;
burden (or at least provide less of a boon) to Hungary's budget and balance of&#13;
payments. As a matter of fact, in 1981 there was a sharp increase (about 9%)&#13;
in the prices of Hungary's imports settled in rubles. Consumer price subsi-&#13;
dies are only one part of the total price support expenditures from the&#13;
budget. Assistance for enterprises represented 9.5% of GDP in 1981 (a decline&#13;
from 12.6% of GDP in 1978 and 1979) and support for agro-cooperatives another&#13;
1.2% of GDP (increasing from 0.9% of GDP in 1978 and 1979). Total price sub-&#13;
sidies thus amounted to 18.7% of GDP in 1981 (down from 20% of GDP in 1978 and&#13;
1979).&#13;
The authorities are committed to the reduction of subsidies. In July&#13;
and August 1982, prices were increased by 10-30% for certain construction&#13;
materials, by 15-20% for some services, by 40% for coffee, by 25% for some&#13;
cereal products and by 100% for long distance transportation. These measures,&#13;
and the depreciation of the forint in July and December brought the inflation&#13;
rate to 8.2% in 1982. The authorities are planning further price increases in&#13;
1983, including those for rents, passenger transportation, gasoline and&#13;
household fuels. The continuation of these measures is necessary both for&#13;
reductions in budget subsidies and for improvements in economic efficiency.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Credit Policies 1/&#13;
Since the introduction of the New Economic Mechanism, and particu-&#13;
larly since 1979, credit policies have become an increasingly important&#13;
instrument for determining the level and direction of investment expendi-&#13;
tures. Since 1979, the most dramatic change which has taken place in the&#13;
financing of investment is the increased use by enterprises of their self-&#13;
generated and retained resources for the undertaking of investments. But the&#13;
need for enterprises to have recourse to bank credits for the financing of&#13;
investments has provided the authorities with mechanisms to channel invest-&#13;
ments in pre-determined directions. This has been done, for example, through&#13;
the establishment of a number of preferential credit schemes including those&#13;
for promotion of exports, rationalization of energy and raw materials use, and&#13;
promotion of research and development.&#13;
Important to an understanding of how credit policies work in Hungary&#13;
is the fact that the financial structure of the economy is relatively&#13;
undeveloped and there has been an almost complete absence of money and capital&#13;
markets. 2/ In this sense, the structure resembles that of other developing&#13;
countries. The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) functions as both the central&#13;
1/   This section draws heavily on World Bank (1983).&#13;
2/   There are indications of the development of an embryonic unorganized&#13;
money market to meet the needs of small private sector enterprises. In&#13;
1983 a number of measures were taken which lay the basis for both finan-&#13;
cial and quasi-equity investments by socialist sector enterprises in&#13;
other non-financial socialist sector enterprises. The legal framework&#13;
for bond issue has also been established. Both financial and non-&#13;
financial enterprises may issue bonds but non-financial enterprises must&#13;
do so with the assistance of a financial institution. Public utilities&#13;
and housing authorities may now sell bonds to private individuals. These&#13;
measures were taken to promote reallocation of resources from less to&#13;
more efficient enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

bank and a commercial bank. The state banking system (consisting principally&#13;
of the State Development Bank [SDB] which makes loans and grants for state-&#13;
initiated large scale investments and the National Bank which makes loans to&#13;
enterprises) is the major source of credit. Transactions between enterprises&#13;
and those between enterprises and the government are conducted through demand&#13;
deposits held in the National Bank, while transactions between enterprises and&#13;
households and within the household sector are entirely in cash terms. The&#13;
National Bank thus has a pivotal role in the system. In recent years, it has&#13;
pursued an increasingly active credit policy, including changes in the cost of&#13;
credit. In making credit allocations, the National Bank has increasingly&#13;
examined profitability of enterprises and their efficiency in resource utili-&#13;
zation. For a description of the decision-making process for establishing&#13;
credit policy see Annex 2, Part B.&#13;
Interest Rates&#13;
Interest rates on NBH investment credits have been steadily&#13;
increased: since January 1, 1981 from 9% to 10% on September 1, 1981, and 11%&#13;
on January 1, 1982, in July 1982 they were at 12%, and as of October 1982 they&#13;
stood at 13-15%. Real interest rates on credit to enterprises (deflated by&#13;
changes in producer prices) were about 7% positive in October 1982. These&#13;
interest rates apply irrespective of the maturity of credits. To be eligible&#13;
for NBH credits, all prospective manufacturing investments must yield a&#13;
minimum profitability (calculated as the proportion of annual profits to fixed&#13;
and stable working assets) of at least 15%. Maximum maturities on credits are&#13;
ten years, although most credits are repaid in much shorter periods of time.&#13;
Interest rates on working capital credits have also been raised by steps from&#13;
10-11% on January 1, 1981 to 13-14% as of July 1, 1982, and 14-16% as of&#13;
October 1982. Interest rates, on July 1, 1982, for credits for innovation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
purposes were 11%; for medium- and long-term export credits 8.25%; on&#13;
reorganization credits 8%; and 11% for credits for advances from the technical&#13;
development fund. Interest rates on state development loans were set at 10%&#13;
on July 1, 1982 (up from 8% in January 1981) and 13% from October 1982. All&#13;
the above interest rates are positive--in the range of 3-7%--in real terms.&#13;
There has not in recent years been any increase in the interest rate&#13;
paid on savings deposits of households which, depending on period of deposit,&#13;
have ranged between 2% and 5%, and 6% and 7% in the case of savings notes. In&#13;
1981, therefore, these rates were negative in real terms. Interest rates on&#13;
deposits fixed for periods between six months and two years, as of January 1,&#13;
1982, varied between 3% and 7% for local councils, and 3% and 9% for enter-&#13;
prises. Thus, deposit rates have been relatively low compared with lending&#13;
rates, and in the case of the household sector they are largely negative in&#13;
real terms.&#13;
Credit and Enterprise Self-Finance&#13;
A dramatic change which has occured in recent years (as can be seen&#13;
in Table 4) is the increased use by enterprises of their own resources for&#13;
financing investments which they initiate. The share of enterprise resources&#13;
in enterprise-initiated investments increased from 51% in 1976 to 69% in&#13;
1981. On the other hand, the share of credits provided by the NBH declined&#13;
from 27% in 1976 to 20% in 1981. Despite this relatively small share, credit&#13;
allocations, along with the use of other economic regulators, has an important&#13;
influence on the direction of enterprise investments. In credit policies,&#13;
besides the rapid upward adjustment of interest rates, there has also been a&#13;
policy of graduating enterprises towards harder financing sources, that is&#13;
from state grants to state loans and to NBH credits. As a matter of fact&#13;
state grants have effectively disappeared for some sectors and have been only&#13;

Regulation of Enterprise Incomes&#13;
This section examines the mechanisms by which the level and distribu-&#13;
tion of enterprise incomes are influenced. These regulations, along with&#13;
those on wages and prices, are among the more important instruments used by&#13;
the authorities to influence enterprise-level activities and ensure their&#13;
consistency with broader economic objectives. By varying the rules or&#13;
granting exceptions in certain cases, the authorities can affect the level and&#13;
direction of enterprise incomes and their allocation.&#13;
Socialist sector enterprises are subject to seven major types of&#13;
taxation and several quasi-taxes which affect the amount of profits and&#13;
depreciation available for investment through the development fund or of&#13;
profits available for distribution as wage increases or supplements through&#13;
the sharing fund. Formal taxation includes (a) production and consumer&#13;
turnover taxes charged on enterprise outputs (which when negative may be&#13;
subsidies and were discussed in the section on price regulation), (b) tariffs&#13;
paid on imported inputs, the so-called differential turnover tax on imports of&#13;
petroleum and raw materials under CMEA agreements as well as domestic produc-&#13;
tion, (c) social security taxes on the wage bill, (d) the tax on depreciation,&#13;
(e) municipal and national profit taxes, (f) construction taxes on development&#13;
fund resources used to build new plant, and (g) progressive taxes on sharing&#13;
fund distributions over certain limits (see the section on wage regulation&#13;
below). Quasi taxes include the required level of contributions to the&#13;
reserve fund, the difference between interest paid on these reserves and the&#13;
rate paid on voluntary reserves, and the costs imposed by any limitations&#13;
which may be placed upon the use of any funds owned by the enterprise. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
analysis which follows explains how taxes (c)-(g) and the quasi taxes operate&#13;
to regulate the funds available for investment and the remuneration of&#13;
labor. The discussion applies primarily to state enterprises, though some&#13;
differences which apply to cooperatives are noted.&#13;
The Mechanisms&#13;
Figure 4 shows how the receipts of a state enterprise (net of produc-&#13;
tion taxes plus subsidies and of refunds of differential turnover taxes on&#13;
exports) are channeled toward payments to suppliers, workers, the state budget&#13;
(including municipal councils), the banks, and various enterprise funds. 1/&#13;
A major difference in the treatment of state enterprises and non-&#13;
agricultural cooperatives, on the one hand, and agricultural cooperatives on&#13;
the other, involves depreciation. In the former, 40% of depreciation allow-&#13;
ances are centralized with some exceptions through the state budget, whereas&#13;
all cooperatives are allowed to retain all their depreciation, a system that&#13;
gives them greater flexibility in initiating new investments. However, both&#13;
types of enterprises can use retained depreciation to augment their development&#13;
funds, which in turn can be used to make enterprise-initiated investments. In&#13;
1983, in a move to restrict investment, depreciation rates on plants (but not&#13;
machinery and equipment) were reduced by 30% on the average. An enterprise's&#13;
wage bill is taxed at the rate of 27% 2/ (for agricultural cooperatives the&#13;
figure is 17% of personal income 3/. This tax serves as the largest source&#13;
The main deviations from the general system involve agriculture; trade;&#13;
enterprises providing municipal, cultural, and health services; the manage-&#13;
ment of state-owned rental housing; and research and development institu-&#13;
tions. In November 1983, a number of significant changes in wage and income&#13;
regulations were announced. They became effective January 1, 1984. Among&#13;
the changes were abolishment of the reserve fund, modifications in the&#13;
formation and taxation of other enterprise funds, changes in depreciation&#13;
rates and centralization of depreciation allowances. Most of these changes&#13;
are transitional in nature as more profound changes are expected in 1985.&#13;

3-10% assessed on individual wages and earmarked for the pension fund. 1/&#13;
The profits subject to tax are net of payments to a special fund for&#13;
welfare and cultural services and to a voluntary reserve fund that allows&#13;
importers of basic materials from non-ruble areas to offset temporary fluctua-&#13;
tions in import prices. The latter fund is voluntary. As it is formed from&#13;
pre-tax profits, it is normal that, if it is not used to bridge a negative&#13;
price differential, it goes back to normal profits, pays tax, and then can be&#13;
used without restrictions.&#13;
A municipal profits tax of 15% (10% for agricultural cooperatives)&#13;
falls on profits just before the repayment of both interest and amortization&#13;
on SDB loans, but before the 45% general profits tax. In the case of&#13;
cooperatives, rather than a general profits tax there is a progressive tax on&#13;
the sum of wages and profits. NBH credits are much more "expensive" for a&#13;
firm then SDB loans, since the interest and amortization on them must be paid&#13;
out of the enterprise's development fund after the general profits tax, an&#13;
obligatory 20% contribution to the enterprise reserve fund, and the allocation&#13;
of bonuses to managers. The percentage of after-tax profits which must go to&#13;
obligatory reserves and which is used as a regulator has frequently been&#13;
varied. As with all other enterprise funds, an enterprise's reserves have&#13;
been maintained in accounts at the NBH. From June 1982, compulsory reserve&#13;
fund deposits by socialist sector enterprises are held with the Central Bank&#13;
of Exchange and Credit, Ltd.&#13;
An enterprise's ability to use the compulsory reserve fund is limited&#13;
by statutory conditions and an obligation of restitution. Subject to replace-&#13;

ment within five years, an enterprise may draw on the fund to cover losses or&#13;
to raise annual profits to a specified proportion of their level in a preced-&#13;
ing year or, in some circumstances, to transfer resources to the development&#13;
fund to increase its working capital. The compulsory reserve fund can also be&#13;
used to cover obligated payments when the sharing or development funds are&#13;
inadequate, but must be repaid within two years. 1/ If an enterprise's&#13;
reserve funds are insufficient, it can pre-finance them through bank advances.&#13;
Each of these taxes and contributons falls on what is left after the&#13;
previous charges on profits. Therefore, even if a state enterprise had no SDB&#13;
loans to repay and paid no bonuses to its managers, its distributable profit,&#13;
from which the development fund can be formed, would be only about 37% of the&#13;
accounting profit, and still less after social security tax increases which&#13;
took place on January 1, 1983. Distributable profits can be allocated by an&#13;
enterprise to the development fund, the sharing fund (which is used to&#13;
supplement wages) and voluntary additions to reserves. Management makes this&#13;
choice after consultation with the trade unions. 2/&#13;
In addition to allocations of after-tax profits and depreciation, an&#13;
enterprise development fund may be increased by investment from the state and&#13;
transfers of development funds from other enterprises. Use of this fund is&#13;
subject to the following order of priorities: NBH credit repayments, the&#13;
1/   In 1983 limitations and reductions in the uses of the compulsory reserve&#13;
funds were tightened with the aim of limiting investment resources.&#13;
Until then enterprises could draw on compulsory reserve funds to raise&#13;
their annual profits to the level of the previous year. Now such funds&#13;
may only be used to reach 80% of the previous year's profit after&#13;
taxation and less fulfillment of reserve fund obligations when drawing on&#13;
the reserve fund to cover inadequacies of the sharing fund, repayment&#13;
must now be in one year rather than two.&#13;

financing of increases in working capital, obligations to other enterprises,&#13;
coverage of operating losses, and financing of new investments. Any remaining&#13;
funds may be lent or transferred to other enterprises or institutions or lent&#13;
to employees for dwelling construction.&#13;
Allocations to the sharing fund are subject to a highly progressive&#13;
tax. The 1980 reform introduced a tax-free threshold that is higher the more&#13;
profitable the enterprise; this provision was intended to allow formation of&#13;
larger sharing funds by more efficient enterprises. The profitability&#13;
indicator for purposes of the tax is defined as the ratio of the enterprise's&#13;
profits before the profit taxes are taken out to the sum of the net assets and&#13;
the wage bill. For enterprises with an average profitability rate of 8-10%,&#13;
formation of a sharing fund up to a ratio of 2% of the wage bill is tax-free;&#13;
beyond this, the marginal tax rate is highly progressive, reaching a maximum&#13;
of 800% at sharing fund rates of 14% or more. After payment of the tax on&#13;
wage increases (see the section on wage regulation below) and restitution of&#13;
any shortages in the welfare and cultural fund, the remaining profits in the&#13;
sharing fund can be used for various forms of remuneration to employees to&#13;
supplement wage payments.&#13;
Finally, the enterprise's choice between the application of distri-&#13;
butable profits to the development fund or voluntary reserves is affected by&#13;
the interest rate paid by the NBH on voluntary reserves, 1/ as well as by&#13;
perceived investment opportunities and the tax structure affecting the sharing&#13;
fund.&#13;

An enterprise which is experiencing financial losses is obligated to&#13;
improve its situation without any external support by drawing, in this order&#13;
on: (a) the reserve fund, complemented by any tax refunds due after part of&#13;
the reserve fund has been used up; (b) the special reserve fund for bridging&#13;
price fluctuations; and (c) the part of the development fund not obligated for&#13;
other purposes, complemented by tax refunds and depreciation allowances.&#13;
After settling its losses in the way outlined, the enterprise has to&#13;
meet its obligations toward the state and the banks and finally toward other&#13;
companies. However, it may happen that, after meeting all these obligations,&#13;
the company is no longer able, or at least not to the extent prescribed, to&#13;
form the various funds for the following years. Any shortages in its develop-&#13;
ment or sharing funds have to be covered out of its remaining reserve fund.&#13;
The NBH may help bridge these financial difficulties either by making a loan&#13;
against future entries to the reserve fund or by rescheduling the repayments&#13;
of outstanding investment credits.&#13;
If the losses still cannot be met, the enterprise must undergo&#13;
rehabilitation. This may involve debt rescheduling for SDB loans and NBH&#13;
credits, direct support from the state budget (for example, by allowing the&#13;
enterprise to retain more than 60% of its depreciation allowances), new bank&#13;
credits or loans, or liquidation of part of the company's assets. The last&#13;
resort is to terminate the enterprise by reorganization (contraction, merger&#13;
or division) or by liquidation. Reorganization has been chosen in the vast&#13;
majority of cases. Critics have argued that this approach represents a soft&#13;
budget constraint" and weakens the incentives to efficiency by enterprises in&#13;
the initiation and implementation of investments. 1/&#13;

The Uses of Income Regulation&#13;
The income regulation system for enterprises allows authorities to&#13;
pursue structural and macroeconomic policy objectives by various means: they&#13;
can differentiate among sectors or they can vary the tax rates, the rules&#13;
guiding the formation and uses of funds, and the interest payments on the&#13;
accumulated resources or advances for the different funds. All these methods&#13;
have been used, and in some cases the changes have been frequent.&#13;
For example, in late 1981 and early 1982, when it became evident that&#13;
higher than expected profits were leading to excessive investment, the tax on&#13;
construction was raised from 10 to 20% (a move which favored investment in&#13;
equipment as opposed to new plants); in addition, the municipal contribution&#13;
rate was raised from 10 to 15%. In a further effort to control investments by&#13;
enterprises, the compulsory contribution to the reserve fund was increased,&#13;
with retroactive application to 1981 profits, from 15 to 20% in general and&#13;
from 10 to 15% for agriculture; the wage tax was raised from 24 to 27%; the&#13;
latitude of certain enterprises to retain more than 60% of the depreciation&#13;
allowances in their development funds was abolished; enterprises were induced&#13;
to make early repayments of investment credits from their development funds&#13;
and to use additional resources from their development funds rather than bank&#13;
credits to cover working capital needs; and state investment support to&#13;
enterprises was reduced. In 1982, the interest rates paid on obligatory&#13;
reserve fund deposits were cut, and as of July 1, 1982, firms were obliged to&#13;
deposit such interest earnings in compulsory reserve funds. The access of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
large agricultural enterprises to their reserve funds was limited. A portion&#13;
(6%) of the development funds formed from 1981 profts and depreciation&#13;
allowances in 1982 were frozen in compulsory reserve funds. Finally, a new&#13;
25% tax was imposed on net investments made after June 1, 1982, except for&#13;
projects to promote exports to the convertible currency and those to produce&#13;
or save energy and raw materials.&#13;
These measures illustrate the vigor with which the authorities&#13;
respond to short-term economic stabilization needs. By the same token,&#13;
however, significant changes in an economic management system which has only&#13;
recently been initiated introduce considerable uncertainties for decision-&#13;
making by enterprise managers. In the face of such an unstable policy&#13;
environment, experience in other countries indicates that managers seek to&#13;
maximize short-term objectives rather than being concerned with longer-term&#13;
development requirements. This might very well be the case in Hungary. The&#13;
measures taken, albeit in response to pressing stabilization needs, have had&#13;
the effect of reducing enterprise control over profits and of bringing about&#13;
some recentralization, at least in the short-term, of decision-making. This&#13;
runs counter to the objectives of greater enterprise autonomy in decision-&#13;
making, a critical element of which is the control over profits.&#13;
Admittedly, the present difficult international economic environment&#13;
which confronts Hungary makes it hard to identify as clearly as necessary the&#13;
appropriate balance, consistent with the country's medium-term development&#13;
objectives, between central authority and enterprise autonomy. Relaxation of&#13;
some of the binding external constraints, particularly the availability of&#13;
appropriate amounts of external financing, would facilitate the economic&#13;
management task. But, a significant hardening of financial discipline is also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
required in order to ensure that investments which are undertaken are economi-&#13;
cally justified and consistent with medium-term restructuring objectives.&#13;
Wage and Personal Income Regulation&#13;
Hungary's wage and income regulations have four major objectives--&#13;
controlling the growth of purchasing power so as to maintain the planned&#13;
macroeconomic balance, keeping earning differentials within socially accept-&#13;
able bounds, maintaining living standards, and increasing productivity. These&#13;
objectives are admitted to be in conflict in some respects. Since 1968, wages&#13;
have been linked in varying degrees to profits and centrally-determined limits&#13;
of one form or another have been imposed. There have been frequent changes in&#13;
the complex system of wage and income regulations. For example, in 1976,&#13;
major modifications were made on the grounds that profits were heavily influ-&#13;
enced by taxes and subsidies and hence that differentials in productivity did&#13;
not necessarily reflect differences in efficiency. Accordingly, enterprises&#13;
whose wage levels were linked to performance were allowed to grant wage&#13;
increases of 1.5% (even if not justified by the performance indicators). Fur-&#13;
ther, tax-free average wage increases were limited to 6% for all enterprises,&#13;
even those whose performance indicators would have allowed higher wage awards.&#13;
Changes in wage differentials translated into changes in the distri-&#13;
butions of household per capita income even after taking into account social&#13;
grants paid by the government. Table 5 shows the distribution of per capita&#13;
household monetary income (including government transfer payments) by decile&#13;
for the years 1967, 1972, and 1977. Data for more recent years are not avail-&#13;
able. The most notable characteristic of this distribution is its relative&#13;
equality: the ratio between average per capita income in the top and bottom&#13;
deciles did not exceed 4.9 in any of these years. By way of comparison, this&#13;

ratio for Brazil in 1970 was 44.2. 1/ There was a slight but significant&#13;
increase in the degree of inequality between 1967, prior to the 1968 reforms,&#13;
and 1972, with the ratios of average per capita incomes between the top and&#13;
bottom deciles and quintiles, respectively, increasing from 4.6 and 3.3 to 4.9&#13;
and 3.4. This increase in inequality was the subject of considerable contro-&#13;
versy and helped lead to changes in the wage regulation system designed to&#13;
reduce differentials. By 1977, the ratios of average per capita incomes in the tor&#13;
and bottom deciles and quintiles, respectively, had fallen to 4.1 and 3.0.&#13;
Since 1979, when the latest wave of economic reforms directed at&#13;
increasing efficiency and stabilizing the economy began, changes have been&#13;
made in the wage regulations to place more emphasis on stimulating productiv-&#13;
ity and holding down consumption. It has been recognized that this is likely&#13;
to result in greater wage differentials (read more unequal income distribu-&#13;
tion), and further changes are likely (see Section V below).&#13;
Table 6 separates total household income in 1981 by three major&#13;
sources: labor income, which accounted for two-thirds of the total recorded&#13;
income of the population; social income, government transfer payments in cash&#13;
or kind, which together came to just short of one-third of the total; and a&#13;
residual composed largely of interest and rental income, which accounted for&#13;
0.7% of total income in 1981. Labor income is defined as including, over and&#13;
above incomes from employers, the net income of small gardens, household&#13;
farms, and other measured private sector activity attributable to labor. It&#13;
excludes, however, earnings from the underground portion of the "second&#13;

economy" which has been growing over time, but the magnitude of which is&#13;
difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy (Gabor, 1979).&#13;
Non-Labor Income&#13;
Social grants in cash and in kind together were just over one-fourth&#13;
in 1971; the annual growth rate in real terms of these grants was 6.6% between&#13;
that year and 1981 as compared with 1.9% for labor income. This "social&#13;
income" has thus played an important role in supporting living standards,&#13;
although, unless its growth can be slowed, a more than proportional burden for&#13;
adjusting income will fall on labor income. The cash grants are paid for the&#13;
most part, with central social security funds, currently financed by the 30%&#13;
tax on company wage bills (20% in agricultural cooperatives). The grants&#13;
include pensions, sickness benefits, maternity allowances, child allowances&#13;
for families having two or more children, and child care allowances. In some&#13;
cases, they may be supplemented by grants from funds of local councils and&#13;
enterprises. The basic social grants in-kind--consisting of health services&#13;
and education--are general and free.&#13;
Changes in the legislation governing employment-related non-labor&#13;
income must go through the review and decision procedures described in Annex 3&#13;
which deals with wage and employment policy.&#13;
Private Sector Income&#13;
It should be borne in mind that income from recorded private sector&#13;
activity is subject to a progressive income tax. In addition, however, there&#13;
are substantial unrecorded flows associated with the so-called "second" or&#13;
underground economy. The inability of the authorities to regulate these&#13;
flows, together with the relative compression of the differentials in the&#13;
"first" economy, are said to have induced many workers in the first economy to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
hold back in their work in order to devote greater energy to their after-hours&#13;
private economic activity. The high earnings reportedly available from&#13;
untaxed labor earnings in the second economy have probably damped the limited&#13;
incentives of the regulation regime to which the open economy is subject.&#13;
Socialist Sector Labor Income--Major Components&#13;
Labor income in Hungary's socialist sector has three major com-&#13;
ponents: basic wages, productivity-related and other wage supplements, and&#13;
annual distributions from after-tax profits. In state enterprises, the&#13;
precise level of the basic wages and the rules governing the earning of&#13;
productivity-related supplements as well as the distribution of profits, are&#13;
set annually in collective agreements negotiated between the managers of an&#13;
enterprise, and enterprise-level trade unions (in cooperatives, the agreements&#13;
must be approved by the General Assembly, an internal body composed of all&#13;
members). The negotiations are carried out within a complex system of wage&#13;
regulations which, together with an indicator of enterprise performance in&#13;
most cases, have a strong influence on the level of each employee's total&#13;
earning and the level of employment. As explained in some detail in Annex 3,&#13;
the State Office for Labor and Wages (SOLW) is the agency charged with&#13;
formulating and monitoring the implementation of these regulations, and this&#13;
is done in close collaboration with other government agencies and interest&#13;
groups, in particular the National Council of Trade Unions. Major changes in&#13;
the regulations must be approved by the State Planning Committee and the&#13;
Council of Ministers.&#13;
The basic wage ranges for different categories of manual workers,&#13;
non-managerial white-collar workers and managers, established by a decree of&#13;
the Council of Ministers, have remained unchanged since 1977 (see Annex 4,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Tables A 4.1 through A 4.4). Inflation, as measured by the consumer price&#13;
index, was 35% from 1976 through 1981 and was expected to go up about another&#13;
6% in 1982 and 7.5% in 1983. This suggests that the basic wage levels may be&#13;
in need of revision. For any category of worker, the range of the basic wage&#13;
may vary considerably--usually the top of the range is 60-80% higher than the&#13;
bottom.&#13;
The 1976 legislation gives examples of the types of workers that fall&#13;
in to each category--for example, for manual workers, there are six skill&#13;
categories and four combinations of physical effort and working conditions,&#13;
giving a 6x4 matrix of the basic wage ranges; a special category of highly&#13;
skilled manual workers is added to it (see Table A 4.1). However, the trade&#13;
unions negotiate with the branch minister more precise ranges and job&#13;
descriptions within the ranges given in each cell. Then, at the enterprise&#13;
level, all jobs are classified, and a specific basic wage is assigned to each&#13;
in the annual collective agreement negotiated by the union and management.&#13;
Tables A 4.1-A 4.4 show the basic wage structures. For manual&#13;
workers, the upper end of the highest category is six times as high as the&#13;
lower end of the unskilled category. The upper end of the range for general&#13;
managers is 9.6 times the lower end of the unskilled manual labor category and&#13;
3.8 times that of the lowest level of the production foreman.&#13;
Another characteristic of the basic wage structure is the relative&#13;
equality between manual and white-collar pay scales. For example, a non-&#13;
managerial white-collar worker with a university education and 3-8 years of&#13;
experience could get a basic salary of 3,100-5,100 forints per month, whereas&#13;
a highly skilled (category 5) manual worker with a job requiring normal&#13;
physical effort and having good working conditions has a range of 2,960-5,060&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
forints. However, the university-educated white-collar worker's basic salary&#13;
range could rise to 4,900-8,000 forints if he had over 20 years of experience.&#13;
A third characteristic of the basic wage structure is worthy of note-&#13;
-its relatively low level when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing in&#13;
mid-June 1982 (34.05 forints per US dollar). The range is from $40 a month&#13;
(the lowest an unskilled worker could receive) to $382 a month for the general&#13;
manager of an enterprise with more than 10,000 employees. But this does not&#13;
translate into a low standard of living because to basic wage must be added&#13;
not only productivity-related other wage supplements, distributions from&#13;
after-tax profits, social grants and subsidies on goods and services. There&#13;
is no individual income tax on socialist sector income; there is, however a&#13;
progressive contribution to the pension fund which now ranges from 3 to 15%&#13;
(prior to 1983 the range was 3 to 10%).&#13;
The same annual collective agreements specify the rules to be used in&#13;
awarding productivity-related wage supplements, although allowances for&#13;
overtime, shiftwork, language skills, etc., are fixed centrally by the SOLW.&#13;
This component of wages is generally a higher percentage of total wages when&#13;
individual productivity can be clearly measured (e.g., in the case of piece-&#13;
work); in such cases, the basic wage may be set toward the lower end of the&#13;
range. The supplements may sometimes exceed the basic wage. For example, in&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture's Crop Protection Service, the performance-related&#13;
component of a pilot's wages averages 55-60% of total wages. When produc-&#13;
tivity cannot be measured at the individual level, but can be within an&#13;
enterprise unit (say a division), the supplements may be specified at that&#13;
level. For the top managers in a state enterprise, the level of bonuses is&#13;
determined by the relevant branch ministry, and they are taken from profits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
after payment of taxes and compulsory allocations to the reserve fund (see&#13;
Figure 4). For managerial personnel, the bonuses average some 30-35% of&#13;
salaries. Although it is likely that the dispersion of total wages (including&#13;
supplements) is greater than that for basic wages alone, the mission was&#13;
unable to obtain any data to confirm or reject this hypothesis.&#13;
The final component of a worker's earnings in the socialist sector&#13;
consists of that portion of after-tax profits distributed through the sharing&#13;
fund. In 1980, sharing fund distributions averaged 5.0% of total earnings,&#13;
ranging from a low of 3.7% in the construction industry to a high of 6.7% in&#13;
the water works and supply industry (see Table 7). No data were obtained on&#13;
the frequency distributions underlying these averages. It is common for&#13;
distributions from the sharing fund to be related to total wages, but other&#13;
factors such as seniority may also play a role. The precise rules for the&#13;
allocation are spelled out in the collective wage agreement. The allocations&#13;
are made after taxes and obligatory contributions to the reserves. At this&#13;
point, only about 37% of gross profits were potentially available for distri-&#13;
bution (see Figure 4) as of May 1982 even if there were no outstanding loans&#13;
or credits to be repaid. This after-tax profit can be allocated to the&#13;
development fund (for carrying out enterprise-initiated investments), added&#13;
voluntarily to reserves, or distributed to workers. Above a limit, funds&#13;
entering the sharing fund are subject to severe progressive taxation which, in&#13;
practice, is prohibitive. For a large number of enterprises (accounting for&#13;
some 70% of the employment in the socialist sector), in 1981 that limit was&#13;
related to profits as a percentage of assets plus wages. For the remaining&#13;
enterprises, the limit is centrally determined. (See also the section on&#13;
enterprise income regulation.)&#13;

Categories of Socialist Sector Wage Regulation&#13;
All Hungarian non-agricultural socialist sector enterprises are&#13;
subject to one of two basic forms of wage regulation. The first, known as&#13;
wage level regulation, was once the predominant form. It was intended to&#13;
stimulate employment and involved controls on the annual increase in the&#13;
average wage. In 1968, 93% of the socialist sector employees were covered by&#13;
it.  In 1982, only 16% were subject to this form of regulation.    The second&#13;
form, which in 1982 covered about 84% of the employees, is wage bill regula-&#13;
tion. Here it is the annual increase in the enterprise's total wage bill that&#13;
is controlled, a system which gives the enterprise an incentive to increase&#13;
labor productivity by keeping down the number of employees.&#13;
In 1982, in each of these basic types of regulations there were three&#13;
variants, in which the tax-free increase permitted in year t was determined&#13;
by:&#13;
(a) an indicator of how the enterprise performed in year t as compared&#13;
with year t-l (relative regulation);&#13;
(b) a centrally determined percentage (central regulation), or&#13;
(c) a combination of (a) and (b) (mixed regulation).&#13;
Above the tax-free level, increases in the wage bill or average wage&#13;
were subjected to stiff additional progressive taxation to be paid out of the&#13;
sharing fund. In the case of wage bill regulation, the tax schedule in 1982&#13;
was as follows:&#13;
Excess increment in the                  Marginal tax rate as a&#13;
wage bill as a percent                   percent of the wage bill&#13;
of the wage bill of the                  increment in the given&#13;
previous year                            bracket&#13;

lncreases in the wage rates in enterprises subject to wage bill regu-&#13;
lation were also limited to 12% (9% in 1981 and 6% in 1980). This provision&#13;
was intended to limit the extent to which wage rates can be raised through a&#13;
reduction or lesser increase in staff than in the wage bill. For wage rate&#13;
regulation 1982, the following progressive tax schedule applied above the tax-&#13;
free limit:&#13;
Increase in the average                       Marginal tax rate as&#13;
wage rate as a percent                         a percent of the wage&#13;
of the average wage                            increment in the&#13;
rate of the previous year                      given bracket&#13;

More than 2                                    350&#13;
The tax liability on wage increases is paid at the end of the year&#13;
out of the sharing fund on the basis of the wage awards actually granted. The&#13;
wage increases decided during the year are guided by the estimated movement of&#13;
the respective indicators or the ceilings established in advance by the&#13;
authorities.&#13;
The SOLW estimates that the percentages of all socialist sector&#13;
employees covered by each of the six systems in 1982 was as follows:&#13;
Relative         Central       Mixed        Total&#13;
Average wage                1          13            2           16&#13;
Wage bill                  42           17          25           84&#13;
Total                      43          30           27          100&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
In sectors where profitability is not viewed, for one reason or&#13;
another, as an appropriate determinant of wage levels, central and to a lesser&#13;
extent mixed forms of regulation are generally used. The indicator of enter-&#13;
prise performance used in the relative and mixed forms of wage level regula-&#13;
tion in 1982 was the sum of wages and profits per employee. For the relative&#13;
and mixed forms of wage bill regulation, the indicator was the value added,&#13;
defined as wages plus profit plus depreciation. In each case, the indicator&#13;
for year t was expressed as a perecentage increase over year t-1. The&#13;
resulting number was then multiplied by what is known as the "wage coeffi-&#13;
cient," a figure which is set annually by the Council of Ministers based on&#13;
the recommendation of the SOLW and the State Planning Committee. The 1982&#13;
wage coefficient was 0.2; for 1980 and 1981 it was 0.3. Thus, for example, if&#13;
the percentage increase in the indicator for an enterprise was 20 in 1982 as&#13;
compared to 1981, the average wage or wage bill of the enterprise would be&#13;
allowed to increase by 4% in 1982 without incurring stiff and, in practice,&#13;
prohibitively progressive taxation.&#13;
In no case were tax-free average wage increases over 12% allowed,&#13;
irrespective of the wage regulation scheme. This level had been raised from 6&#13;
to 9% in 1980, and then from 9 to 12% in 1982, both to allow for inflation and&#13;
to permit a greater differentiation of wages based on performance. If appli-&#13;
cation of these rules did not produce an average wage increase of at least 2%,&#13;
a 2% increase was permitted. Under all the wage regulation schemes, the&#13;
unused portion of the possible tax-free wage increase can be carried over as a&#13;
wage reserve to be used in future years.&#13;
There was no clear economic rationale for the selection of the&#13;
increase in these indicators over the previous year as a criterion for current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
year wage increases, except that they both supposedly provided incentives to&#13;
increase the nominal level of profits. Nevertheless, it has been observed&#13;
that enterprises expecting high profits in the current year might actually&#13;
seek to hold down the profits, fearing that superior performance would make it&#13;
difficult to grant tax-free wage increases the next year. In 1983 the system&#13;
was changed so that wage rate increases are now linked to the absolute level&#13;
of profitability rather than the increment over the previous year.&#13;
In 1982, the tax-free increases permitted for the central forms of&#13;
regulation were 3% for the wage bill variant and 3.5% for the wage level&#13;
variant. For the mixed forms, the centrally allocated component is less, with&#13;
the exact level being determined on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
For agriculture, until 1980 different income determination schemes&#13;
were applied to state farms and cooperatives, at which time a unified system&#13;
was instituted. It did not use performance indicators, but instead subjected&#13;
the average remuneration to a tax schedule with strongly progressive marginal&#13;
rates. The tax rates rose with both the rate of increase in the average&#13;
remuneration and the level of the average remuneration in the previous year.&#13;
Farms were entitled to distribute the unused potential for increases in&#13;
remuneration in the course of the year into profit sharing at the end of the&#13;
year, without further taxation. In 1983 farms are required to choose between&#13;
a variant of central average wage regulation which includes incentives for&#13;
staff cuts (30% of the savings in the wage bill are free from taxation) and&#13;
one linked to the level of profitability.&#13;
Wage Preferences&#13;
An additional element in the wage regulation system is the right of&#13;
an enterprise to apply for centrally allocated "wage preferences" to carry out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
an economically rational plan which may result in a temporary reduction in&#13;
profits. In 1982, 500 million forints (0.1% of the national wage bill) were&#13;
available for this purpose. In general, applications for the wage preferences&#13;
have totaled 4-5 times availability. The granting of a wage preference now&#13;
requires the unanimous agreement of the SOLW, the National Planning Office,&#13;
the NCTU Secretariat, the relevant branch ministry, and the Ministry of&#13;
Finance. Preferences are authorized only after the enterprise demonstrates&#13;
that it has carried out the plan for which the preference was granted. The&#13;
preferences may take various forms, e.g., an increase in the wage coefficient&#13;
or a decrease in company taxation.&#13;
The Evolution of Real and Nominal Wages&#13;
No data were available to the mission on average wage increases by&#13;
type of regulation. However, Table 8 shows that with the stabilization&#13;
process that began in 1979, the average rates of increase in nominal wages for&#13;
both manual and white-collar workers fell in 1979, 1980, and 1981. The&#13;
absolute level of average real wages fell in 1979 and 1980 as consumer price&#13;
rises accelerated, but then increased again at 1.3 and 1.6% respectively in&#13;
1981 (faster than planned) as the rate of the price increases fell back to&#13;
4.6%, half the level of 1980. The larger than planned increase in 1981,&#13;
together with an apparent surge in profits, led to the reduction in the wage&#13;
coefficient for 1982, as mentioned above, as well as to a reduction in the&#13;
level of the tax-free wage increases permitted to enterprises subject to&#13;
central or mixed wage regulation.&#13;
Issues&#13;
The Hungarian system of wage and income regulation is extremely&#13;
complex, a function of its multiple and conflicting objectives. Many&#13;

Hungarian as well as foreign economists have concluded that it has worked&#13;
better at maintaining a highly egalitarian distribution of measured income, at&#13;
controlling the purchasing power of the population, and at maintaining living&#13;
standards than it has at stimulating productivity. As a result, in recent&#13;
years modifications in the wage regulators have been made. These have&#13;
increased both the role of profits in determining wage levels and the&#13;
percentage of workers covered by the wage bill as opposed to average wage&#13;
regulation.&#13;
Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus that additional wage&#13;
differentiation and a simpler system of regulation are necessary to stimulate&#13;
greater worker effort and more efficient use of labor. However, this may&#13;
prove difficult. There are political objections to increased wage differen-&#13;
tiation, most frequently expressed within the HSWP and the trade union move-&#13;
ment. There is also a major practical obstacle to allowing greater autonomy&#13;
in wage setting in general and a larger role for profits in determining the&#13;
wage bill in particular. Despite the latest round of reforms, central price&#13;
setting and pervasive taxes and subsidies are still found in all parts of the&#13;
enterprise regulation system. Further, many industrial enterprises enjoy a&#13;
very substantial amount of market power. These factors render profits a far&#13;
from perfect indicator of efficiency. As long as it is easier for managers to&#13;
increase profits by seeking special advantages through the regulation system&#13;
or by exercising market power rather than by increasing the efficiency of&#13;
operations, the arguments to limit the role of profits in the determination of&#13;
wages will be persuasive. Even assuming scarcity pricing and competitive mar-&#13;
kets for enterprise output, the profit-linking of wages could lead to inter-&#13;
firm wage differences that do not correspond to differences in labor&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
An additional issue is whether even fairly substantial increases in&#13;
wage differentials will evoke greater efforts by socialist sector workers as&#13;
long as there is the potential for earning several times more for moonlighting&#13;
in the untaxed underground economy, or in the legitimate private sector than&#13;
from their jobs in the socialist sector.    Unfortunately, the lack of any&#13;
reliable statistics on the extent and operations of the "second" economy and&#13;
the novelty of the new forms of small cooperatives, quasi private, and private&#13;
enterprises established beginning in 1982 under new legislation makes it&#13;
difficult to assess the importance of this issue.&#13;
V. THE DILEMMAS OF DECENTRALIZATION&#13;
Unlike the first major round of economic reforms launched in 1968,&#13;
Hungary's recent attempts to further a structural transformation through&#13;
greater decentralization of decision-making and more reliance on market forces&#13;
is taking place in an inhospitable international economic environment. There&#13;
has been a need to adjust to higher energy prices at a time when opportunities&#13;
within the CMEA for acquiring needed petroleum, raw materials, and technology&#13;
have been insufficent. These factors helped catalyze the newest round of&#13;
reforms.&#13;
A series of new external shocks has sharply reduced the resources&#13;
available to Hungary to carry out its strategy of "intensive development."&#13;
Among those shocks have been the Iran-Iraq conflict, which broke out just as&#13;
Hungary was making good progress in trade with both those countries; the&#13;
Polish economic crisis; the sharp rise in real interest rates in the&#13;
international capital markets; the credit squeeze on CMEA countries; and the&#13;
decreasing prices and increasing protectionism associated with the worldwide&#13;
recession. These unfavorable developments have affected the trade, service,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
and capital accounts of the Hungarian balance of payments and have forced&#13;
authorities to contract domestic absorption sharply. It has been investment&#13;
that has borne the brunt of the cutback. Now, however, the question is being&#13;
posed whether the commitment to maintaining living standards should be&#13;
sacrificed, since structural adjustment requires new investment.&#13;
All these factors have placed Hungarian policymakers on the horns of&#13;
three interrelated dilemmnas, all of which have important political implica-&#13;
tions. Is it better to pursue a capability for rapid response or broad&#13;
participation in economic decision-making, equity or efficiency, short-term&#13;
stabilization or medium term structural transformation?&#13;
Speed Versus Broad Participation in Decision-Making&#13;
The Hungarian style of economic decision-making in general, and the&#13;
planning system in particular, appear better suited to a relatively stable or&#13;
slowly changing international economic and political environment than to one&#13;
characterized by rapid change and uncertainty. The consultative nature of&#13;
decision-making in Hungary, with the encouragement it provides to parti-&#13;
cipation by government bodies and interest groups in national decisions that&#13;
are likely to affect them, has helped establish of political consensus and&#13;
commitment to the decisions taken. This process, while it has produced a&#13;
remarkable consensus on the directions of economic policy, involves a cost in&#13;
terms of time needed to respond to changes, diffusion of responsibility, and&#13;
perhaps incisiveness of action. The high degree of openness of Hungary's&#13;
economy, its limited natural resource base outside of agriculture, and the&#13;
international trade and capital markets environment have conspired to reduce&#13;
the time available for reacting to external changes in the world economy. On&#13;
the other hand, if austerity is required over the next few years, the partici-&#13;
patory decision-making process may be critical in maintaining the support for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
reductions in domestic absorption and structural transformations which the&#13;
authorities now perceive as necessary. A major challenge for the Hungarian&#13;
authorities is to combine prompt and decisive economic management with&#13;
appropriate consultation and participation in decision-making.&#13;
Equity Versus Efficiency&#13;
A second set of issues concerns the trade-offs between equity and&#13;
efficiency. These issues are most evident in the operations of the labor&#13;
market and in policies affecting wage-setting and employment. The Hungarian&#13;
system of wage-setting reflects socialist equity tendencies as well as&#13;
efficiency requirements in allocations of labor. It is true that there are&#13;
such tendencies, but to achieve equity in wage setting never has been a&#13;
declared objective. The Hungarian wage setting system, in part, pays workers&#13;
according to the quality and quantity of their work ("to each according to his&#13;
work") with the objective of stimulating economic efficiency. But beyond such&#13;
individual incentives to efficiency, the system seeks to provide collective&#13;
incentives at the enterprise level by linking permissible tax-free wage&#13;
increases and year-end sharing fund distributions to enterprise performance.&#13;
In theory, this system is designed to minimize the contradictions&#13;
between equity and efficiency objectives. But in practice the collectiLv&#13;
incentives may run counter to the individual ones in two ways. The first iq&#13;
that enterprise performance may move in a different direetitn Itron individual&#13;
performance, and thus partially negate the individual inctntive.    Tn principle&#13;
this should guide workers, through the labor market, toward nore profitable&#13;
enterprises, and this is compatible with dynamic efficiency under the normal&#13;
assumptions about competitive pricing. The second is that enterprise&#13;
performance in financial terms may be more a function of favorable tax and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
subsidy treatment of the enterprise by the authorities (the operation of the&#13;
"soft budget constraint") than of collective effort by the workers.    In this&#13;
latter case what is being rewarded is the ability to manipulate the system,&#13;
not economic efficiency.&#13;
Although an objective of the government is to increase income&#13;
differentials according to the work done, many Hungarians feel that the&#13;
relatively low degree of income differentiation which exists in Hungary is a&#13;
positive achievement of socialism and are reluctant to see the differentials&#13;
increase, whether or not justified on efficiency grounds. These contradic-&#13;
tions and tradeoffs are well-recognized by Hungarian economists and&#13;
policymakers, and the system of wage regulation embodies them, both by&#13;
limiting the extent to which enterprise performance can affect labor incomes&#13;
and by setting ranges for basic wages. The enterprise taxation system, which&#13;
falls heavily on profits, also has this effect. Nevertheless, the general&#13;
thrust of the latest economic reforms has been to allow the dispersion of&#13;
labor remuneration to increase in an effort to provide material incentives to&#13;
improve efficiency.&#13;
The Sixth Five Year Plan (1981-1985) clearly calls for a further&#13;
linkage of labor income to productive efficiency. "Creative and high-quality&#13;
intellectual as well as physical work" was to receive higher rewards, and&#13;
differences in income were to increase in identical jobs as well as across&#13;
economic units. Beginning in 1983, a new performance indicator--the ratio of&#13;
profits to the total of fixed assets and wages in the current year--is used to&#13;
determine the tax-free rates of increase in wages permitted in that same year&#13;
up to a 6% limit. Above that level, the rate of taxation of additional wage&#13;
increases is now a function of another indicator, the ratio of current year&#13;
sharing fund paid-out per employee plus current year average wages per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
employee to the previous year's average wage per employee. Taxation of&#13;
sharing fund uses per employee is a function of the same indicator, but&#13;
generally at a lower rate than for wage increases. Wage bill regulation has&#13;
been abandoned, but 30% of savings in the wage bill due to staff cuts is not&#13;
liable to taxation.&#13;
This new system of wage regulation institutes a more direct link to&#13;
profitability than the previous one for enterprises subject to the relative&#13;
and mixed forms of regulation. A firm with higher profitability is able to&#13;
increase its wages and profit distribution faster than one with lower profita-&#13;
bility, even if the rate of profitability does not increase compared with the&#13;
previous year. This should eliminate perverse behavior by enterprises seeking&#13;
to avoid excessive profits in year t in order not to prejudice the possibility&#13;
of tax-free wage increases in year t+1.&#13;
Other actions which may have the effect of increasing income&#13;
inequality are the announced intention to "harden" the budget constraint&#13;
facing enterprises, to stimulate private and quasi-private economic activity,&#13;
and to reduce subsidies for basic wage goods. Greater income differentials&#13;
are viewed by economic policymakers as one of the preconditions to promote&#13;
"intensive" economic development based on increased efficiency and technologi-&#13;
cal change in an era of scarce capital, a lack of major reserves of labor to&#13;
be drawn out of agriculture, and more expensive raw materials.&#13;
These changes do, however, run against the values held by politically&#13;
important institutions such as the trade unions and elements within the&#13;
HSWP. They are likely to be harder to implement if, as is likely given the&#13;
world economic outlook, the Hungarian economy grows slowly or even stagnates,&#13;
rather than expands dynamically in a buoyant international environment, as was&#13;
the case from 1968-73. Further, even if average real wages remain stagnant,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
any increase in differentiation will mean real decreases for some workers as&#13;
well as increases for others.&#13;
The Government's commitment to full employment has been a major&#13;
source of its popular support. Until recently, this was interpreted to mean&#13;
virtually complete job security for workers except in cases of gross incompe-&#13;
tence or continued violations of factory discipline. One of the major&#13;
consequences of this policy has been that high-cost enterprises had to be&#13;
shielded from the repercussions of their own inefficiency. Since they have to&#13;
sell their products on the market, this policy implies: that at least one of&#13;
the following three conditions must prevail: 1/&#13;
(1) a subsidy system must be used which is differentiated to meet the&#13;
needs of individual enterprises;&#13;
(2) enterprises must be protected from competition by giving them&#13;
monopoly rights over both their own products and those which are&#13;
close substitutes; or&#13;
(3) prices must be maintained at levels high enough to cover the costs&#13;
of the most inefficient producers, who must be assured of the&#13;
possibility of selling their products at these prices.&#13;
All three of these conditions have existed to some degree in Hungary even&#13;
since the 1968 reforms, although the latest round of reforms was designed to&#13;
reduce their prevalence.&#13;
The NCTU has taken the position that creating unemployment is not the&#13;
way to get more efficient employment, a position that has been accepted by the&#13;
1/   These points are made in Granick (1975) page 247.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
government. However, since the 1980 National Congress of Trade Unions, the&#13;
NCTU has encouraged workers to stop thinking their jobs are guaranteed.&#13;
Instead, the principle is that they have a right to be employed, a right that&#13;
may, however, mean changing jobs, enterprises, or even place of residence,&#13;
given the need to restructure the economy.&#13;
In part because of the high geographic concentration of industrial&#13;
activity in Budapest, which has made it relatively easy for workers to change&#13;
jobs without having to obtain new housing, and in part because of a tight&#13;
labor market favored by the full employment policy, the rate of labor turnover&#13;
in Hungary has been surprisingly high. In the first years after the 1968 reforms,&#13;
the number of separations fluctuated between 32 and 36% in industry. 1/&#13;
While the average rate for 1979-81 fell to 24.3%, that level was still high.&#13;
In 1981, the separation rate for the entire socialist sector was 23.0%, while&#13;
the hiring rate was 22.9%. The turnover was highest in the construction&#13;
industry and in trade (31.4% and 30.5% respectively), and lowest in the non-&#13;
material branches (14.5%), which include government.&#13;
An important trend has been an increase in the proportion of separa-&#13;
tions initiated by the enterprises themselves rather than by individual&#13;
workers. The rate rose monotonically from 11.4% in 1976 to 34.7% in 1980.&#13;
Because retirements and separations to fulfill military service obligations&#13;
are recorded as involuntary separations, these figures must be interpreted&#13;
with care, but they nevertheless suggest that a growing percentage of workers&#13;
are being fired or laid off.&#13;
1/   Separations are recorded in the statistics whenever a worker is&#13;
registered as leaving or taking a job. Since some workers may change&#13;
jobs or be reemployed by the same enterprise more than once in a year,&#13;
the number of separations and hirings exceeds the number of individuals&#13;
affected by an unknown amount.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Given the objective of hardening the budget constraint in order to&#13;
facilitate restructuring the economy toward the more profitable firms and the&#13;
activities with potential for future growth, as well as the slowdown in&#13;
overall economic growth, it may be expected that the trend toward a larger&#13;
number of involuntary separations will continue in the coming years, and it is&#13;
likely to become more difficult to find new jobs for those who want them. A&#13;
major issue, then, is how to handle the redeployment of those who lose their&#13;
jobs and, more generally, how to facilitate the workings of the labor market,&#13;
which in Hungary today involves free contracts between individual workers and&#13;
enterprises, coupled with the government's commitment to maintain full employ-&#13;
ment. Maintaining this commitment is likely to require an upgrading of&#13;
existing employment services and greater efforts at retraining. Both the SOLW&#13;
and NCTU Secretariat are aware of these needs. At the same time, clearly&#13;
there will be a cost, which in the current economic environment may require a&#13;
fall in real wage levels.&#13;
In May 1982, there was no computerized national job information&#13;
service, though in 1981 the county council labor registration offices were&#13;
transformed into an employment service network. Previously the local councils&#13;
decided which companies could attract new labor, since contracts could only be&#13;
made if the local councils so decided. There were no uniform national guide-&#13;
lines, and cases arose in which a company and a potential employee could agree&#13;
on a contract, but were still required to go through a difficult, time-&#13;
consuming process. This system no longer exists. Now if a company wants to&#13;
dismiss more than 10 workers at a time, it must inform the employment&#13;
office. Each country council office must then inform the SOLW about any&#13;
surplus or deficit in jobs. These new procedures help the system find jobs&#13;
for those in need of assistance. In one town experiments with a computerized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
job placement system were underway in 1982. An obvious extension would be to&#13;
link all the county employment offices through a computerized network.&#13;
It is official policy not to force people to move far away from where&#13;
they were formerly employed if at all possible, in part because of housing&#13;
shortages. In fact, the availability of housing has been a major factor&#13;
influencing the employment choices of individual workers. This problem is not&#13;
likely to get better in the near future because of cutbacks in public housing&#13;
investment. This situation makes retraining programs and regional development&#13;
planning all the more important.&#13;
A broader issue is whether the relative prices of labor and capital&#13;
in Hungary today may be encouraging labor-hoarding by firms. With positive&#13;
real interest rates and the phasing down of capital grants the cost of capital&#13;
to firms is probably at a realistic level. However, wages and salaries appear&#13;
low by international standards, even after adjusting them upwards to reflect&#13;
the social security contributions of 30%. They probably are low, in part&#13;
because of the significant degree to which basic wage goods in Hungary (such&#13;
as food, mass transportation, public housing, and home heating fuels) are&#13;
subsidized and also because of the low level of personal income taxes.&#13;
This broader issue is part of a debate over the proper shadow price&#13;
for labor in the economic analysis of large investment projects. It merits a&#13;
thorough study, a task beyond the scope of this paper. In any case, it is the&#13;
declared policy of the government to reduce consumer subsidies gradually.&#13;
Short-Term Stabilization Versus Medium-Term Structural Transformation&#13;
The third dilemma or trade-off which confronts the authorities arises&#13;
from the need to pursue short-term stabilization policies while transforming&#13;
the productive structure of the economy in the middle-term. The principal&#13;
economic regulators used by the authorities operate at the level of the&#13;

enterprise. In recent years, major changes have had to be made in the&#13;
economic regulators either in response to changed world economic conditions or&#13;
when domestic absorption showed signs of increasing more rapidly during the&#13;
course of a year than was consistent with balance of payments objectives.&#13;
Such mid-year corrections have effectively voided even the annual economic&#13;
plans. For example, in 1981 and again in 1982, excessively rapid growth of&#13;
domestic absorption (which because of lags in information flows came to the&#13;
knowledge of the authorities only towards the middle of the year), has led the&#13;
authorities to make ad hoc policy adjustments such as the partial freezing of&#13;
enterprise funds and increases in social security contributions. Similarly,&#13;
policy adjustments within a year have been required by severe shortfalls in&#13;
availabilities of external financing. These adjustments have introduced&#13;
uncertainties in the policy environment within which enterprises operate and&#13;
has accentuated the "stop-go" nature of investment decisions.&#13;
It should be possible and is in principle desireable to speed up the&#13;
information flow through the use of the highly centralized banking system to&#13;
computerize a set of standard enterprise accounts and economic indicators&#13;
which could provide weekly or monthly data to national economic policymakers&#13;
with very short lags. However, if such data were available, the authorities&#13;
would be tempted to alter the regulators constantly in pursuit of short-term&#13;
goals. Such shifts in the policy environment would tend to work against&#13;
longer term structural transformation objectives.&#13;
In a decentralizing economic system, stability of the policy environ-&#13;
ment, greater control over resources by enterprises, and their greater ac-&#13;
countability for the use of resources are essential conditions for structural&#13;
transformation. If workers and managers believe that large profits will be&#13;
taxed away, while losses will not be penalized, they will have little material&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
incentive to increase their efforts and to accelerate the pace of technologi-&#13;
cal change--all objectives of the economic reforms. Frequent policy shifts&#13;
and administrative interventions lead to uncertainties in both the direction&#13;
and pace of decentralization. But stability of policies in the face of a&#13;
deteriorating external economic environment is possible only if a country has&#13;
adequate access to international capital markets, or large foreign exchange&#13;
reserves on which it can draw. Neither of these circumstances characterizes&#13;
Hungary today. A question which arises is whether the instruments available&#13;
to Hungarian policy makers are of a sufficient variety to deal with the com-&#13;
plexities of adjustment to past external shocks and the medium-term structural&#13;
transformation of such an open economy.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
The three dilemmas or trade-offs confronting Hungarian policymakers&#13;
are clearly interrelated and can be alleviated by an improved international&#13;
economic environment. The Hungarian style of economic decision-making can no&#13;
doubt be streamlined somewhat, but its essential characteristic of broad&#13;
participation and consensus-building has proven effective in providing needed&#13;
support for an integrated package of economic reforms. Hungary's New Economic&#13;
Mechanism launched in 1968, despite backslidings in the mid-1970s, has proven&#13;
more durable and efective than other less ambitious or less well prepared and&#13;
supported reforms tried elsewhere in Eastern Europe. But it has costs in&#13;
reaction time, costs which can be more easily borne if the international&#13;
environment is relatively stable or expansive and the authorities have foreign&#13;
exchange reserves and access to capital markets so as to be able to ride out&#13;
short-term external shocks.&#13;
An increased use of differentiation in wages could probably con-&#13;
tribute to increased economic efficiency. But to the extent such differen-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
tiation is brought about by linking wages to enterprise financial performance,&#13;
the efficiency objective will be achieved only if a consistent set of reforms&#13;
is pursued so that the enterprise profitability becomes a reasonably accurate&#13;
reflection of economic efficiency.&#13;
Promoting structural transformation requires replacing or upgrading&#13;
parts of the capital stock which have been rendered obsolete by technological&#13;
change or fundamental changes in prices, particularly energy prices. At the&#13;
same time, new investment is required if Hungary is to move into products and&#13;
industries with competitive promise in the international markets of the&#13;
future. But investment and production of competitive manufactured exports&#13;
generally requires increased imports. If needed and potentially highly&#13;
profitable investments are choked off in order to meet short-term balance of&#13;
payments constraints, achieving the desired structural transformation and its&#13;
economic benefits will have to be postponed. But it seems that in Hungary&#13;
there still exists significant scope for improvements in investment alloca-&#13;
tions and the utilization of inputs to provide economic benefits, even in the&#13;
present difficult international economic environment.&#13;

FINANCIAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES&#13;
A. The Selection Process for Major State Investments&#13;
The decision-making process for a major state investment is complex&#13;
and begins long before the project reaches the council of ministers. The&#13;
first stage in the project cycle is the preparation of a draft project&#13;
proposal which covers both financial and technical aspects. Copies are sent&#13;
to the SDB; the relevant branch ministry; the National Planning Office; the&#13;
Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Foreign Trade; the Ministry of Internal&#13;
Trade; the Ministry of Housing, Public Construction and Town Development; the&#13;
National Bank of Hungary; the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the National&#13;
Committee on Technical Development. The enterprise preparing the project will&#13;
receive comments from all of these institutions.&#13;
Within the SDB, the Economics Department makes a preliminary&#13;
financial screening. The proposal is then further investigated by the&#13;
relevant branch department at headquarters to see how the project fits into&#13;
national development plans. It is also sent to the territorial office&#13;
covering the executing enterprise, where both financial and technical&#13;
feasibility is examined through direct contact with the enterprise. The SDB&#13;
checks whether the proposed construction companies and machinery builders can&#13;
meet the requirements of the project and whether the executing enterprise is&#13;
capable of managing the operation. Opinons are also obtained from the&#13;
National Prices and Materials Board and relevant trading companies regarding&#13;
projected prices of inputs, outputs and capital goods. In this process, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
National Price Forecasting and Market Research Institute, a self-financing&#13;
institute linked to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, may be consulted.&#13;
The executing enterprise receives comments from all the agencies to&#13;
which the proposal has been sent, and a meeting is held by the relevant branch&#13;
ministry to discuss the comments. Subsequently, the executing enterprise&#13;
prepares a revised draft proposal which must indicate explicitly which&#13;
opinions received were not incorporated. The second draft is then sent to the&#13;
same institutions for their comments.&#13;
The National Planning Office provides a summary of second-round&#13;
comments to all the institutions involved. The agencies most likely to&#13;
present critical analyses resulting in eliminating or major changes in&#13;
projects are the National Planning Office, the SDB and the NBH.&#13;
The revised proposal, which must indicate any remaining areas in&#13;
which the enterprise has not accepted the opinions of the institutions con-&#13;
sulted, is presented to the State Planning Committee of the Council of&#13;
Ministers by the relevant branch minister. If approved by the State Planning&#13;
Committee, the project is then presented to the full Council of Ministers for&#13;
final approval.&#13;
B. Formulation of Credit Policy and the Credit Guidelines&#13;
The elaboration of a credit policy is the responsibility of the NBH,&#13;
and in particular its Credit Policy Department. However, the elaboration of&#13;
credit policy guidelines and "credit balances" (a kind of credit budget by&#13;
lending bank and line of credit) is closely integrated with the preparation of&#13;
annual and five-year national development plans and the state budget, and thus&#13;
is done in close consultation with the National Planning Office and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
At the first stage of the process each institution works indepen-&#13;
dently. Then the three institutions hold meetings at the working level to&#13;
negotiate a consistent credit policy, plan and state budget. The negotiations&#13;
proceed upward, next involving the Director ofthe Credit Policy Department,&#13;
then the Deputy President of the NBH, and finally the President of the NBH.&#13;
At this stage the President of the NBH chairs the Credit Policy Committee, an&#13;
advisory body which includes deputy-level representatives from the National&#13;
Planning Office, the branch ministries, the National Board for Materials and&#13;
Prices, the State Office for Labor and Wages, and the Hungarian Chamber of&#13;
Commerce. This committee examines the proposed credit guidelines and credit&#13;
balance in some detail before they are sent to the State Planning Committee,&#13;
and thence for final approval to the full Council of Ministers.&#13;
Within the annual credit balance there is an open line which can be&#13;
used to reallocate resources between other lines during the year depending on&#13;
NBH reports to the State Planning Committee after the data for the first&#13;
quarter of the year are available. This report includes forecasts for the&#13;
remainder of the year and usually proposes some changes in the credit&#13;
balance.  For example, the May 1981 report proposed increasing the credit&#13;
available for export promotion, and the Council of Ministers approved a recom-&#13;
mendation of the State Planning Committee that the export promotion line&#13;
should be incrased by one billion forints. Any major change in interest rate&#13;
policy must be approved by the Council of Ministers, but the President of the&#13;
NBH can alter interest rates by one percent in either direction at his&#13;
discretion.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES FOR WAGE AND EMPLOYMENT POLICY&#13;
The governmental agency responsible for the formulation of wage and&#13;
employment policy is the State Office for Labor and Wages (SOLW--see Figure&#13;
A.3.1), successor to the Ministry of Labor which was abolished in 1981. The&#13;
SOLW has a staff of about 70, but also has close ties to the Institute for&#13;
Labor Research, which has a staff of 80 and to the Center for Labor Informa-&#13;
tion, which has a staff of 60 (the Center collects data on wages and employ-&#13;
ment and is linked to the Central Statistical Office). The SOLW is actively&#13;
involved in the elaboration of labor law through its Wages and Labor Force&#13;
Department. While it has no power to intervene directly in the employment&#13;
decisions of individuals, in many ways it does help establish the incentive&#13;
framework that influences these decisions. Through its Territorial Department&#13;
it maintains relations with the County Councils, which are responsible for&#13;
operating the employment (placement) service, including support for retrain-&#13;
ing. The SOLW also advises the Council of Ministers and the National Planning&#13;
Office on questions of demographic policy affecting the size of the labor force.&#13;
In formulating wage and employment policy the SOLW must work closely&#13;
with the National Council of Trade Unions (NCTU) Secretariat (see Figure&#13;
A.3.1) and with a new advisory body, the Council for Wages and Labor Affairs&#13;
(CWLA), established at the beginning of 1982. The CWLA is staffed by a small&#13;
secretariat appointed by the SOLW and includes representatives of the NCTU,&#13;
the National Council of Agricultural Cooperatives, the National Cooperative&#13;
Union (for trading cooperatives), the National Union of Industrial Coopera-&#13;
tives, the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce, the National Planning Office, the&#13;

Ministry of Finance, and the branch ministries. Other interest groups or&#13;
government agencies may be invited when a matter of interest to them is being&#13;
discussed, and any governmental decision which will result in a legal rule&#13;
governing employment, wages, and social insurance must be discussed in this&#13;
Council. The minutes of relevant meetings of the Council must be provided to&#13;
the Council of Ministers and its economic committees so that the ministers&#13;
will be aware of the opinions of interest groups when they make decisions.&#13;
By far the most important interest group involved in making wage and&#13;
employment policy is the NCTU (see Figure A.3.2), which is composed of some&#13;
250 people elected by the National Congress of Trade Unions. The NCTU serves&#13;
as the top deliberative body of the trade union movement between congresses,&#13;
which have traditionally taken place every four years, but are now expected to&#13;
be held every five years to mesh with the planning cycle. It has a presidium&#13;
of some 40 members which directs the work of its Secretariat between sessions&#13;
of the NCTU. The Presidium has decision-making power and can control the&#13;
execution of resolutions of the National Congress of Trade Unions.&#13;
The SOLW consults regularly with the staff of the NCTU Secretariat,&#13;
especially the Economics and Living Standards Department. The NCTU's Deputy&#13;
Secretary General is a permanent invitee of the State Planning Committee and&#13;
the Economic Policy Department of the HSWP Secretariat. Twice a year, in&#13;
April and October, joint meetings are held between the NCTU Secretariat and&#13;
the full Council of Ministers to analyze what changes in wages and employment&#13;
policy (including changes in the wage regulation system) may be necessary in&#13;
light of recent economic developments, as revealed by the preliminary economic&#13;
indices for the first and third quarters, respectively. The SOLW is bound to&#13;
abide by and implement any decisions reached in these joint meetings. Matters&#13;
requiring such decisions are discussed previously at working level meetings&#13;

between the SOLW and the NCTU Secretariat and also in the CWLA and the&#13;
economic committees of the Council of Ministers.&#13;
On wage and employment issues of broad interest to the trade union&#13;
movement which are to be discussed in the Council of Ministers, draft position&#13;
papers are circulated to all 19 branch trade unions by the Economic and Living&#13;
Standards Department of the NCTU Secretariat. That body then prepares an&#13;
opinion for the Secretariat, which is discussed in the NCTU Presidium. For&#13;
example, during the elaboration of the 1981-85 five-year plan, the NCTU sub-&#13;
mitted 34 major comments on a draft of the plan obtained through this process,&#13;
the majority of which were taken into account in the final version of the&#13;
plan. Among the salient concerns of the NCTU have been to avoid a drop in&#13;
living standards during a period of economic retrenchment, to limit the&#13;
increase in the differentiation of wages associated with the decentralization&#13;
of economic decision-making, tQ maintain full and efficient employment, and to&#13;
promote the concept of workplace democracy.&#13;
The NCTU has taken the position that creating unemployment is not the&#13;
way to get more efficient employment, and this position has been accepted by&#13;
the government. Instead, the NCTU has encouraged workers to stop thinking&#13;
that they are guaranteed their jobs, but instead that they have a right to be&#13;
employed, which may mean changing jobs, enterprises, or even place of resi-&#13;
dence given the need to restructure the economy. This position has meant&#13;
strong NCTU support for greater efforts at retraining and facilitating reloca-&#13;
tion. Moves to increase workplace democracy include the decision of the 1980&#13;
National Congress of Trade Unions to have direct rather than indirect election&#13;
of shop stewards to an enterprise Trade Union Council. The 1980 Congress also&#13;
mandated that, for the next Congress, the NCTU Secretariat prepare proposals&#13;
to increase the role of enterprise Trade Union Councils in the selection of&#13;
managers and the evaluation of their performance.&#13;

            Economic decision making structures and
            processes in Hungary : the dilemmas of decentralization
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Since 1968, Hungary has attempted to
            combine central planning of the economy with a significant
            decentralization of economic decision making at the
            enterprise level. In pursuing this objective, Hungarian
            authorities have increased their reliance on indirect
            controls and market forces, while preserving a number of
            bureaucratic structures characteristic of the more
            traditional socialist economies and maintaining a strong
            commitment to equity in income distribution. The
            country's policymakers now confront the complex task of
            developing a technologically advanced socialist economy that
            is capable of adapting rapidly to changing world conditions
            which it cannot control, within the constraints imposed. the
            economic management system that has been chosen, and the
            country's history, geography, and resource endowments.
            This paper describes the current decision-making structures
            above the enterprise level, looks at the role of planning in
            the Hungarian system, and examines some of the economic
            regulators used. The paper discusses three dilemmas facing
            policymakers: (i) speed vs. participation; (ii) equity vs.
            efficiency; and (iii) short-term stabilization vs.
            medium-term structural transformation. It concludes that
            these trade-offs are interrelated and can be alleviated.
