&#13;
                   Loans to the Kingdom of Belgium and the Belgian Congo.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  2&#13;

     THE CHAIRMAN:    I want to announce that the bond issue was&#13;
a big success.   We haven't gotten the final figures, but the&#13;
issue was substantially oversubscribed and the bonds are&#13;
selling at no premium, so we hit it right on the nose.      The&#13;
bond was quoted last night at 99 3/4 bid and par and 1/4&#13;
asked.   The transactions, I think, were taking place at par,&#13;
so I think we can say that we figured it pretty exactly.        The&#13;
buying was excellent.    There were a number of large new&#13;
&#13;
institutions and some new pension funds that bought the bonds&#13;
for the first time.     I think there is a good chance, if the&#13;
general market doesn't show any weakness, that our bonds&#13;
might sell somewhat higher after the original distribution&#13;
takes place, although there are a great many proposed new&#13;
&#13;
offerings of bonds coming into the market.     So it depends a&#13;
good deal on the extent of the supply of the new offerings,&#13;
but I think people generally feel that the issue vas attractiv&#13;
in price, and after the original distribution takes place&#13;
I think the secondary market bonds might t,~=r a premium.&#13;
     You have received the papers concerning the proposed&#13;
loans to the Belgian congo and the Kingdom of Belgian.      I&#13;
would like to call on Mr. Koster and Mr. Cope to speak on the&#13;
loans, and then Mr. Kamarck to speak on the economic&#13;
situation.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. KOSTER:     Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, the Executive&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     3&#13;
                                                                         I&#13;
&#13;
Directors have been informed by the President in the beginning I&#13;
of May of this year of the possibility of two loans, one to&#13;
the Belgian Congo and one to the Kingdom of Belgium.         There&#13;
has been a mission to Belgium and the Congo, and subsequently&#13;
negotiations were started in Brussels.       The Executive&#13;
Directors have been informed of the proceedings through the&#13;
semi-monthly reports, and in the last regular meeting of the&#13;
Executive Directors I had an opportunity to explain generally&#13;
the principles underlying the negotiations which were then&#13;
being carried on in Brussels.&#13;
      With the permission of the Chairman, I would like to call&#13;
on Mr. Cope to tell you about the main features and the&#13;
subsequent negotiations which have been carried on in&#13;
Washington.     Mr. Cope has headed the mission to Belgium and&#13;
the Congo and has also carried on the negotiations in&#13;
Brussels and in Washington.&#13;
      THE   CHAIRMAN':    I would like to ask Mr. Kamarck to come&#13;
up.&#13;
      MR. KAMARCK:       Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, economic&#13;
&#13;
development in the Congo is a very recent tnng.        It began&#13;
scarcely fifty years ago and has encountered very great&#13;
obstacles because of the nature of the problem.        The country&#13;
1s very large, about as large as the United States east of&#13;
the MissisSippi, with all the main productive regions about&#13;
&#13;
a thous and miles inland from any sea.       It 1s very sparsely&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 4&#13;
&#13;
populated.    There a.re oIlly about eleven million Africans and&#13;
less than sixty thousand Europeans.     The populatIon itself&#13;
was and largely is stIll very primitive.      It 1s a people that,&#13;
before the Europeans came, didn't have the plow or the wheel,&#13;
didn't know the art of writing, and still does not have a&#13;
d raft animal.&#13;
&#13;
     Still, in spite of all of this, considerable progress&#13;
has been made in the last fifty years.      The Congo has become&#13;
an important source of' primary agricultural and mineral raw&#13;
materials.    Last year exports reached a total of $330,000,000&#13;
equivalent.      ThIs development, however, has run up against&#13;
several over-all problems and several over-all limitations.&#13;
The main ones of these are shortages in transport and electric&#13;
pover, and a lack of qualified native labor.      Also, the&#13;
native agriculture has developed about as far as it can&#13;
develop without a change, a fundamental change, in the whole&#13;
baSis.   The Belgians, therefore, have prepared a ten-year&#13;
plan for the economic and social development of the Congo&#13;
which entered into execution in 1950.&#13;
     This plan provides for public investment tn basic&#13;
equipment and the necessary social services to go with it.&#13;
     The original estimate of the cost was that it would be&#13;
around the equivalent of $520 million.      Based on the&#13;
experience of' the first two years, a reappraisal of the plan&#13;
&#13;
Is goIng to be made next year in the light of experience as&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                5&#13;
to whether there needs to be a change in the plan, and also&#13;
in the light of the change in prices.    It is nov expected that&#13;
it will cost in the neighborhood of $660 million equivalent.&#13;
It is also expected there will be roughly an equivalent amount&#13;
of private investment in the productive sectors, that is, in&#13;
&#13;
industry, in mining, and in agriculture.&#13;
     The original estimates provided for about 50 percent of&#13;
&#13;
the total cost of the plan to go into transport -- water,&#13;
road, and air.   A further 10 percent was to go into communicaÂ­&#13;
tions, water supply, electriCity, and the remaining 40 percent&#13;
&#13;
into these necessary basic social services.&#13;
     On the whole, the plan appears to be very well worked&#13;
&#13;
out and well designed to meet the needs of the Congo.    There&#13;
is to be a further increase in the production of the&#13;
commodities in which the Congo specializes, and further&#13;
development of industry.     Also, the 40 percent of the plan&#13;
which is going into the social services is Vitally necessary.&#13;
This 40 percent is going into native education, housing,&#13;
public health, and in the economic and social development&#13;
of the native communities.     It is impossible for the Congo&#13;
to progress unless the native population is brought along&#13;
&#13;
in the advance of civilization.&#13;
     There has been very small European immigration into the&#13;
Congo.   As I said, the total has reached less than sixty&#13;
&#13;
 thousand.   Because or the climate and because or policy,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               6&#13;
&#13;
there are no plans for further large immigration, so that&#13;
&#13;
the development of the Congo depends upon how rapidly the&#13;
&#13;
native himself can progress in learning the necessary technic I&#13;
&#13;
skills.&#13;
&#13;
     The consensus of opinion in the Congo, both among the&#13;
&#13;
public and among those Belgians that best know the Congo,&#13;
&#13;
that is, the businessmen and economic experts, is that the&#13;
&#13;
plan is very well worked out.   There is really remarkable&#13;
unanimity on that score.&#13;
&#13;
     As I mentioned, the plan is based on the assumption that&#13;
&#13;
as the public investment creates the possibilities, private&#13;
&#13;
investment will come in to take advantage of those possiÂ­&#13;
&#13;
bilities.   That assumption seems to be very well founded.&#13;
&#13;
From experience in the first year and a half of the plan,&#13;
&#13;
and from the investment programs of the private enterprises&#13;
&#13;
already existing in the Congo and in the interest shown by&#13;
&#13;
investors abroad in the Congo, there seems to be very little&#13;
&#13;
doubt but that as the basic equipment, the transport, expands&#13;
&#13;
the private investment will come in to take advantage of&#13;
&#13;
these opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
     In the first year and a half of the plan, from&#13;
&#13;
January 1, 1950, to last July 1st, a total of only around&#13;
$60 million was spent on the plan.   This was largely due to&#13;
&#13;
the usual inherent difficulties in starting a program as&#13;
&#13;
large as this one, that is, preparing a detailed plan, asking&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     7&#13;
for bids, the contractor getting started, and so on.          However,!&#13;
that initial period is substantially over, and in the next&#13;
two years, that is, from July 1st to June 30, 1953, the&#13;
Belgians estimate, and it appears reasonable, that they will&#13;
be able to spend in the neighborhood of $220 million, and&#13;
that is the program which the Bank is helping to finance.&#13;
        On the whole, the administration of the plan and the&#13;
private investment in the Congo is in very competent hands.&#13;
The people appear to be capable, energetic, hard working,&#13;
and really devoted to the cause of the Congo.          If the plan&#13;
is successful, exports should rise by from one - third to&#13;
&#13;
one - half, and the national income of the Congo should&#13;
increase by 50 to 100 percent.&#13;
&#13;
        Taking into consideration all of the factors which I&#13;
have just mentioned, and the fact that the plan is well&#13;
worked out and is in capable hands, I would say that the&#13;
chances of success of the plan are excellent.&#13;
&#13;
        THE CHAIRMAN:   Thank   yOUj   Mr. Cope.&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COPE:   Mr. President, I believe that it is not&#13;
unoommon for offioers who are introducing a loan to olaim&#13;
&#13;
that their loan is the most important that the Bank has ever&#13;
made.     I think that is just human nature.       With your perÂ­&#13;
mission, Mr. Chairman, I am going to be human, too, but I am&#13;
going to suggest refpeotfullY that there are three reasons&#13;
&#13;
why this loan should be oonsidered an important one.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              8&#13;
&#13;
     The first reason that I would like to mention is that&#13;
&#13;
this is the first loan in whIch we have given effect to the&#13;
recent decision of the Executive Directors regarding&#13;
consultation on incurring of external debt.     I think in this&#13;
respect the loan marks a new phase in our relationships with&#13;
member governments who are borrowers.&#13;
     The next claim I would like to make is that this is&#13;
important in that it is the first loan that the Bank has made&#13;
to a dependent territory.     I think in that respect it may set&#13;
a pattern.     Not, of course, that the pattern of colonial&#13;
structure is uniform throughout the world.     On the contrary,&#13;
there are wide variations, and there will therefore have to be&#13;
wide variations in the   w~   in which we set up loans to&#13;
dependent territories.     I think, nevertheless, that this loan&#13;
may set a pattern, and I hope that in the coming years we&#13;
may find many opportunities of lending for dependent&#13;
territories.&#13;
     The third reason why I think this loan is important is&#13;
perhaps the one which is worth streSSing most.     This is the&#13;
first loan which we have made which is expressly for the&#13;
purpose of meeting direct and indirect foreign exchange costs&#13;
of the program.     I fully admit that there are dangers in the&#13;
Bank getting involved in grandiose schemes for general&#13;
improvement of countries which haventt been worked out in&#13;
&#13;
detail.   I admit, Mr. Chairman, that there are undeniable&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                 9&#13;
merits in making loans to specific enterprises for specific&#13;
&#13;
and limited purposes.            That sort of loan will, I believe,&#13;
&#13;
continue to play a part in the work of the Bank, and I&#13;
&#13;
personally welcome the greater flexibility which the type of&#13;
&#13;
loan under consideration will give to us.&#13;
&#13;
      May I now turn, Mr. Chairman, to one or two special&#13;
&#13;
fea.tures of these loans which in the main arise from the&#13;
&#13;
third point I have just made, Ilamely, the fact that this is&#13;
&#13;
a progra.."1l loan.&#13;
&#13;
      The first spec1al feature is that it is based on the&#13;
&#13;
impact of a certain program.                 Th~t   impact has to be estimated.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Kamarck and the Economic Department have worked out with&#13;
&#13;
the best figures tha.t are a.vaila.b1e the economic               impa(~t   on&#13;
&#13;
Belgium and on the Belgian Congo of the execution of the plan.&#13;
&#13;
The consequence of' that estimation is tha.t we halTa no list&#13;
&#13;
of goods " as we have had 1n most loans which we have made,&#13;
&#13;
because what we are really financing is a vep3 wide range&#13;
&#13;
of prod 1Jctlon and consumer goods, and It would be quite&#13;
&#13;
impossible to attempt to draw any sorÂ·t of list to which we&#13;
&#13;
could tie the borrowers specifically.&#13;
&#13;
      The thIrd special feature of these loans is that for&#13;
&#13;
the same rea.son we cannot he.ve ':iJ.:IY p.l:'E,eise .figurE'S of the&#13;
&#13;
curl-alleles wbJeh aI'e 1rl1lO 1ved.            Since the 1mpact has to be&#13;
&#13;
est Ima.ted In &amp;J!!ount,    WlÂ£~     [~lso   have to ebtimate the c urI'enc&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
Bank to pI'ovide Sw iss francs or not, and if Swiss franc;:.;&#13;
&#13;
cannot be IH'ovided the Bank will lend dolla.rs.&#13;
&#13;
        The fourth speci                        feature I would like to rneIltjoll is&#13;
&#13;
the ba.sis of disbursement.                         These two leans fl.re in essence&#13;
&#13;
one opeI'atioll, and we are therefore treatIng them alike                                       ill&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
dealing with disbursement.                          Disbursement in both cases is&#13;
&#13;
ba.sed on the expendIture of OTRACO.                                   Now, it would, of course,&#13;
&#13;
have basIl possible to have taken all arbltl'ary proportIon of&#13;
&#13;
the total       rlan and based our a 1 sbursemellt ou tba.t, but                              aftel"&#13;
&#13;
giving tt \'ery careful consideration we came to the conclusion&#13;
&#13;
that there were good and solId                            1'ea80115 why       we should want to&#13;
&#13;
ba.se it on th.e expenditure of OTRACO.&#13;
&#13;
        As Dr. Kamarck has already mentioned, tl'ansport is the&#13;
&#13;
key to the development of the Congo.                                    It is a sort of touchÂ­&#13;
&#13;
stone.      If tI'anspolÂ·t falls, then the program as a whole will&#13;
&#13;
fail.    We therefore thought that w.as a good reasou why we&#13;
&#13;
should tIe specifically our disbursewent to what is a basic&#13;
&#13;
and integral rarÂ·t of the whole program.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                11    '
&#13;
&#13;
     The second rea.son why we decided to select OTRilCC as the&#13;
basis for disbursement is that by so doing we follow it&#13;
closely and get an insight into the development not only of&#13;
the OTRACO program    itself~   but an insight into the development&#13;
of the whole plan.     It is, as it were, a representatIve part&#13;
&#13;
of the whole program.&#13;
     The next pOint I want to mention is the relationship&#13;
between the rate at wh:tch we di sburs9 and the progress of the&#13;
program.    You will recall that the basis for this loan :is the&#13;
program as a whole.     AB   I have just mentioned, we are relatIng&#13;
disbursement to OTRACO, and we have therefore taken steps to&#13;
see that there is no basic disparity between those two&#13;
concepts.    We have therefore provided -- as you will probably&#13;
have noticed in paragraph 22 of the President's report and&#13;
recommendations -- that we have agreed with the borrower&#13;
that in tbe contingency that the expenditure on the program&#13;
lags behind the expenditure on OTRACO we will slow down&#13;
in our disbursements so as to keep pace with the progress&#13;
of the program whlcb Is the real basis for this loan.&#13;
     My next point is a small one but it has occasioned&#13;
&#13;
careful thought, BJld that concerns the division of these&#13;
d:t.sbursements between the two loans.     We are using the&#13;
d:lsbursements on OTRACO to provide the disbursement basis&#13;
for both loans, and the question therefore arose as to how we&#13;
&#13;
should divide them between the two.        Should we do it prorata&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   12&#13;
&#13;
or should ve do it on some other basis?       Arguments could be&#13;
put forward fer another basis, but we fel t i t best, after&#13;
giving it very careful consideration, to adopt the simple and&#13;
obvious way of divid1.ng each disbursement in the proportion&#13;
whlch the total amount of one loan bears to the total amount&#13;
of the other.     Thus, of eve!"Y d:f.sbursement that we make,&#13;
3 cents will be for the loan to Belgium and 4 cents for the&#13;
Congo.&#13;
     ~~   last pOint, Sir, is that the loan to Belg1um, as you&#13;
will recall, is to meet the impact on Belgium of the orders&#13;
vhich the Congo is placing in Belgium.       Belgium will receive&#13;
the dollars to meet that impact, and the Belg1.an Government,&#13;
the borrower, will sell the foreign excbange to the National&#13;
Bank of Belgium and will be credited with the equivalent in&#13;
Belgian francs.&#13;
     The question arose as to hov those francs should be&#13;
dealt with and as to whether the Bank should make any provision&#13;
regarding them.     The Congo is well supplied at the moment with&#13;
Belgian francs, but we felt it best to provide that, as and&#13;
when the Congo needs additional Belgian franc resources,&#13;
those would be made available to the Congo by Belgium.           You&#13;
will see that in the loan agreement there is a specific&#13;
provision requiring the Kingdom of Belgium and the Congo to&#13;
make an arrangement sa.tisfactory to us, to see tha.t that money&#13;
&#13;
is available if required.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 13&#13;
     Sir, I don't think there is anyth:lng more I need to say,&#13;
except to mention briefly the mission.     As Dr. Kamarck has&#13;
sa.id, the mission visite'd the Congo.   We spent some time at&#13;
the principal administrative centers, and we were very&#13;
impressed with what we saw.    We are impressed with perhaps&#13;
&#13;
three th:lngs in particular.   First of all is the vast size&#13;
and the r1ch resources of the Congo.     The Congo is a&#13;
territory that has enormous potentialities.&#13;
     The second point that impressed us was the ability and&#13;
the devotion of the officials of the administration in the&#13;
Congo to their jobs.    Under difficult conditions, sometimes&#13;
isolated from the comforts that they are accustomed to, they&#13;
are displaying rare enthusiasm and a rare integrity.&#13;
     The th:lrd point I wish to make is that we were very&#13;
impressed with their readiness to talk and show us everything.&#13;
We were shown everything we wanted to see.     We didn't see the&#13;
whole of the Congo, of course, but they placed every facility&#13;
at our disposal to see what we determined important to fulfill&#13;
our mission.&#13;
     I believe, Mr. Chairman, that the Bank is taking a&#13;
farSighted and constructive view in aSSOCiating itself with&#13;
developing the Congo.&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     Are there any questions?&#13;
     MR. BEYEN:   Mr. Chairman, I would like to start by&#13;
&#13;
saying that all of u.s who know someth1ng about negot! stions&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                14&#13;
&#13;
. with Belgium know that it hasntt been exactly easy.   There&#13;
 were many pOints or principle on both sides, as we have all&#13;
 learned in our work here, and it is much easier to combine&#13;
&#13;
 two opposing interests than to combine two opposing ideas.&#13;
      I think we can congratulate the management and the starr&#13;
 that they have been able to rind a formula to do th1s, a&#13;
 rormula which satisfies the idiosyncrasies, if I may say so,&#13;
 of both parties.&#13;
      I think we all feel happy that this transaction is&#13;
 coming to completion.   I personally feel happy that it has&#13;
 come to completion, because as my friend and colleague,&#13;
 Mr. Basyn, knows, I have from the start also felt an urgent&#13;
 wish in a transaction of this kind that it should be done by&#13;
 the Bank with what we in the Netherlands proudly call our&#13;
&#13;
 Benelux partner.&#13;
      There is one question I have to ask, Mr. Chairman.     On&#13;
 page 10 of the economic report on Belgium, where the internal&#13;
 finances are described, and where reference is made as to&#13;
 Belgium's stability, it says:&#13;
      "The relative stability in the existing means or payment&#13;
 was preserved only as a result of a continuously correcting&#13;
 process whereby the new purchasing power created by the&#13;
 banking system was offset through the loss of reserves."&#13;
       I can guess what it means, but it is not completely&#13;
&#13;
 clear to me, and I would be grateful to the Economic Departme t&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    15&#13;
if they would explain just a little bit about how this works.&#13;
Which reserves?&#13;
     MR. KAMARCK:     The monetary reserves.&#13;
     MR. BEYEN:     That is the confusing part of it.       All right,&#13;
I am satisfied.&#13;
     MR. CIGLIANA-PIAZZA:     Mr.    Chairman~   I wish to join&#13;
Mr. Beyen in his remarks, both as a compliment to the staff&#13;
and approval for the extremely interesting project which we&#13;
are going to finance.&#13;
     SIR ERNEST ROWE-DUTTON:        Mr. Chairman, in saying I&#13;
&#13;
welcome the loan I am really welcoming an extraordinarily fine&#13;
&#13;
effort by Dr. Kamarck and Mr. Cope, and a very fine spirit&#13;
of help and cooperation on the other side.&#13;
     The loan seems to me important in various ways.          It is&#13;
the impinging of Western money on a civilization in the Congo&#13;
which is very new.     It is hardly fifty years old.       I hope&#13;
that we in the Bank look on it as a kind of guinea pig.&#13;
New ideas are impinging on a completely new civilization.&#13;
     There are going to be problems of which we here are as&#13;
yet hardly aware.     The effect on the native population seems&#13;
to me a very big question indeed.        I hope that we shall be&#13;
allowed to follow through not only the impact of our loan at&#13;
its center, as it were, on the general problem of native&#13;
work and education, which is the essential point, but also of&#13;
&#13;
the plan as a whole.     I want, therefore, to express the hope&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   16&#13;
that we will try to analyze for ourselves the really difficult&#13;
points.    Certainly the native problem is one.     It is allIed&#13;
with health problems l which will clearly come     UPI   and the&#13;
movement of populations to areas where they will be confronted&#13;
with new limitations l new vices l new diseases.     But all that&#13;
can be very interesting.    That is why I would like to treat&#13;
it as a guinea pig and from time to time have full and detaile&#13;
reports on how it is working.&#13;
     One phrase used by Mr. Cope left me just slightly&#13;
uncertain.     That is the position that our loan might be&#13;
slowed down.     That is, I am sure, quite reasonable, as long&#13;
as it is not too real.     We donlt want to stop suddenly doing&#13;
something we are dOing and wait for three months while someÂ­&#13;
thing is being done around the corner.     It needs to be handled&#13;
with a pretty broad brush to be sure that things are going on&#13;
around the corner, but donlt leave a half-done job.&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     Does anyone else have any questions?&#13;
     MR. HOOKER:     Mr. Chairman, I think it is essential in&#13;
considering these loans that we emphasize that both loans are&#13;
loans to carry out the development program in the Congo.           That&#13;
is the purpose of both these loans, the loan to Belgium as&#13;
well as the one to the Congo.     I am certainly in favor of&#13;
them, and apparently the Board is well disposed toward both&#13;
&#13;
of them.&#13;
&#13;
      I want to compliment the staff on the way they worked&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 17&#13;
them out, but I think it is essentIal that the idea not be&#13;
gotten by people who read about the loans that they are&#13;
two separate loans.   The purpose of both of them is to carry&#13;
out the program in the Congo, and I don't thInk we want to get&#13;
the idea, particularly   my   government does not, that the Bank&#13;
ha.s made two separate loans and is making a loan to Belgium&#13;
without it beIng tIed to the Congo development program.&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:    I think tbat is certainly definitely&#13;
understood by the Belgium Government.     There is no question&#13;
about that.&#13;
     MR. DIEZ:    Mr. Chairman, a few words on behalf of the&#13;
Latin American countries in relation to this loan.      It bas&#13;
been verry gratifying to the representatives of the Latin&#13;
American countries.    I have been able to check during the&#13;
present meeting with the governors of practically every one&#13;
of the nineteen countries that are represented in the Bank&#13;
concernlng this loan, whIch according to our understanding&#13;
is really for the development of an underdeveloped area.&#13;
     Latin America will always back loans of this nature and&#13;
is very pleased with tbis first experIence, because the&#13;
representatives of the different countries find that the&#13;
studies that are made are so complete and so well directed&#13;
to the real development of the Congo area.      Our vote will be&#13;
100 percent for the loan.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. CHANG:    Mr. Chairman, besides associating myself&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        p~~                                           18 I&#13;

WithAPaying compliments to the staff, I would like to suggest,&#13;
                              t1&#13;
Mr. Chairman, that we take this opportunity to inform the&#13;
Governors who are in session here of this newly concluded&#13;
loan.         I think it will have a good -- I&#13;
                                                             S&#13;
                                                              :t:a2:6...    say Â­&#13;
"propaganda value, n ~ this loan contains some new features ,.,                              Ie.,&#13;
I am sure the Governors would like to know about.&#13;
         In the meeting the other day, you announced the flotation&#13;
     Oft"            Atjlllj                                     ~/$tj&#13;
of   1::iJe   new :E6:iiii, and I think the Bank oatllttake this occasion&#13;
to announce these loans.                       I am sure the Governors would like&#13;
to be informed.&#13;
         I may add that in sittIng through these seSSions, both in&#13;
the Fund and the Bank, I oannot help but feel that the&#13;
management in the Fund has oertainly a very trying ordeal.                             On&#13;
the other hand, there are nothing but bouquets thrown at the&#13;
management of the Bank.                       So I think that it would be a good&#13;
idea if this information is passed out to the Governors.&#13;
         THE CHAIRMAN:                 That is a good suggestion.          The only time&#13;
we could do it would be in the olosing session.                            We wonlt&#13;
sign the loan contraot, if it is approved, until this afterÂ­&#13;
noon, so we will see if we can do it.                       We can at least put&#13;
a press release in the boxes.                        It is a good suggestion.&#13;
         Anything else?&#13;
         MR. HOPPENOT:                 Mr. Chairman, everything that is related&#13;
to the loan itself was extremely well Said, but I would not&#13;
&#13;
pass this occasion without reminding you that Belgium and its&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 19&#13;
territories are both very close neighbors to our country, and&#13;
&#13;
that we are always very happy at what is happening on the&#13;
other side of the road, or rather on the other sIde of the&#13;
river.   So I just want to congratulate and welcome the new&#13;
loan that has been given to that old friend of ours to go&#13;
ahead in its development and prosperity.&#13;
          81t5'1N&#13;
     MR. J:A:a:::aCK:   I would like to say a few words,&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Chairman.&#13;
     Two and a half years ago the International Bank made a&#13;
loan of $16 million to Belgium for the purchase of industrial&#13;
equipment.    This was very timely assistance.   The equipment&#13;
for the steel and electrical industries which was financed by&#13;
this transaction is by now integrated in Belgium's industrial&#13;
economy, is already contributing substantially to the&#13;
country's productivity, and is helping to ease its dollar&#13;
position by non-artIficial means.&#13;
     The Bank is now again lending its assistance to Belgium,&#13;
&#13;
this time to help her in the huge undertaking of developing&#13;
her colony.     This task was energetically started more than&#13;
half a century ago.     Belgium has now committed herself for&#13;
more than two years ahead to the acceleration and methodical&#13;
coordination of the development of the Congo.&#13;
     The International Bank's help will allow my country to&#13;
carry on this work with continuity, which is essential to the&#13;
&#13;
achievement of such a vast enterprise, and we hope that this&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              20&#13;
&#13;
will be accomplished as smoothly as possible.&#13;
     I am particularly grateful to the International Bank for&#13;
having taken special precautions to safeguard the Belgian&#13;
eoonomy against exoessive pressures as a resu.lt of the&#13;
Ten-Year Plan.   I am glad to state that the Bank has, in this&#13;
connection, shown much understanding and flexibility, and I&#13;
trust Belgium and her colony may count upon the Bank's&#13;
cooperation and advice all along the arduous path of a&#13;
colonial enterprise which is undertaken with a determined will&#13;
to give the native h1s full share in the material improvements&#13;
they are striving to attain.&#13;
     Mr. PreSident, I want to thank you and your very able&#13;
and devoted assistants for the relentless efforts you have&#13;
&#13;
made to bring to its fruition a double transaction whioh has&#13;
many new and oomplex aspects.     These aspects, at times, gave&#13;
rise to new problems, but your wisdom and your clearsightednes&#13;
in the end overcame these obstacles.&#13;
     Most of the members of the Belgian delegation spent&#13;
their time yesterday in studying and looking over the papers,&#13;
and we were all satisfied.     We hardly found any inaccuracy,&#13;
and I want to congratulate the members of the staff for&#13;
&#13;
having shown suoh ability to grasp the very complex problem&#13;
of the Congo.    This is really remarkable work, Mr. President.&#13;
We were all very pleased in going over these papers.      EveryÂ­&#13;
&#13;
thing was really remarkably exposed, and the operation is a&#13;
&amp;#12;,I:                                                                               21&#13;
&#13;
      very complicated one.            I want to congratulate the staff on        tha~&#13;
      job.&#13;
             I want to congratulate the staff also for having traveled&#13;
      to the Congo.     Traveling is not pleasant there, and they had&#13;
      disregard for their own convenience.&#13;
             A last word for Mr. Bayen.          Notwithstanding what the&#13;
      papers say, I thought Benelux was a complete success, and I&#13;
      would like to thank him.&#13;
             THE CHAIRMAN:         This is the start of the press release:&#13;
             "The International Bank for Reconstruction and Developmen&#13;
      today announced the approval of loans to Belgium and the&#13;
      Belgian Congo to aid in the development of the Belgian Congo.&#13;
&#13;
      One loan of $40 million is to the Belgian Congo.                 It w1ll be&#13;
      fully guaranteed by the Kingdom of Belgi~.                  The other loan is&#13;
      to the Kingdom of Belgium."&#13;
             MR. HOOKER:         I didnft want to give the impression that&#13;
&#13;
      my government isn't delighted that the program in the Congo&#13;
      is working out so well and isnft to be pushed rapidly.                 We&#13;
      are very interested In the development of the Congo.&#13;
             THE CHAIRMAN:         If there are no further questions, may I&#13;
      hear a motion to adopt the first of the two resolutions?&#13;
             (The motion was duly made         and   seconded.)&#13;
             THE   CHAIRMAN:       .All in favor say "aye."&#13;
             (Chorus of    It   ayes. " )&#13;
&#13;
             THE CHAIRMAN:          Opposed, "NO."&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 r   ,   I&#13;
                                                                2c       '&#13;
&#13;
     (No response)&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     The motion is adopted.&#13;
     Now the second.     All in favor say "aye."&#13;
     (Chorus of "ayes.")&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     Opposed, "No."&#13;
     (No response)&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     I hereby declare the resolutions approved,&#13;
&amp;~ the loan of $40 million to the Belgian Congo and $30&#13;
&#13;
million to the Belgian Government.&#13;
     I think that Mr. Cope was completely justified in&#13;
&#13;
claiming that this was one of the most important loans the&#13;
Bank has ever made.     I certainly am delighted to see it&#13;
concluded, because it has been a    ve~   long, drawn-out affair.&#13;
I think it is going to make a very great contribution to the&#13;
Belgian Congo.     I think it is a very important step in the&#13;
&#13;
Bankt s history.&#13;
     The loan contracts will be Signed this afternoon at&#13;
4 otclock, so we would like to ask that this be kept oonÂ­&#13;
&#13;
fidential until that time.&#13;
     The meeting this morning 1n five minutes is our specia.l&#13;
meeting.   We hope all of you can be there.&#13;
     Is there any further bUSiness?&#13;
     (No response)&#13;
     If not, the meeting st ands ad jourlled.&#13;
&#13;
      (Whereupon, at 9:45 a.m., the meeting was adjourned.)&#13;
