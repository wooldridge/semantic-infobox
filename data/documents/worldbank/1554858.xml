Foreword&#13;
The explosion of international migration in the Middle East and&#13;
North Africa Region in the 1970s was a major development on the international&#13;
economic scene with profound implications for both the labor-importing and the&#13;
labor-exporting countries. The World Bank undertook a research study on the&#13;
subject in 1978 under the leadership of Ismail Serageldin and his group of&#13;
committed colleagues in the Technical Assistance and Special Studies Division&#13;
of the EMENA Projects Department. The study was completed in 1981 and the&#13;
Report has been widely disseminated. It has been published in book form this&#13;
year. 1/&#13;
The set of simulation models developed by the Technical Assistance&#13;
and Special Studies Division and elaborated during the research project has&#13;
been applied to study manpower problems and planning issues in several&#13;
countries and proven to be a useful tool for manpower planning. The wide&#13;
availability and a full description of these models is important and to be&#13;
welcomed.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This document, published in four volumes as part of the World Bank's&#13;
staff working papers, is intended to set forth the mathematical formulation of&#13;
the Bank's various Manpower Planning Models, most of which have now been used&#13;
in a number of countries and studies, but whose technical documentation was&#13;
not hitherto available to the public.&#13;
Applied Models are living entities, constantly changing and (we hope)&#13;
improving to meet the new requirements introduced by their users. The present&#13;
publication must therefore be seen as a snapshot in time, but one which&#13;
presents the interested user with the opportunity of reviewing the technical&#13;
documentation as well as the user's guides as they stand at the beginning of&#13;
1983. They are not likely to change significantly until a new round of&#13;
intensive applications produces a new generation.&#13;
The technicaI presentation provides, for completeness, a detailed&#13;
discussion (pp. 98-132) of a simultaneous procedure method for the migration&#13;
model. This has not been implemented to date, partly because time and&#13;
resources constraints prevented its complete development and elaboration, but&#13;
it nevertheless sketches out the likely direction of our next round of&#13;
research and development efforts, planned for 1983/84.&#13;
It is important to emphasize, however, that while we were the main&#13;
protagonists in the development of these models, the work would not have been&#13;
possible without the support, guidance and incisive comments of many&#13;
colleagues in and outside the Bank. To all of them we owe a great debt of&#13;
intellectual and moral gratitude. We emphasize, however, that any errors or&#13;
shortcomings in the present manuscript are purely our own.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
The Compound Model provides an analytical tool to facilitate&#13;
the initiation, updating and evaluation of manpower forecasts. The&#13;
model adopts the approach of portraying a country as a whole, where&#13;
manpower inventories, demand, and supplies, including importation of&#13;
expatriates, are simulated over time. The model is deterministic,&#13;
that is, all future events 6f the dynamic interactions are simulated&#13;
according to specified procedures without involving random elements.&#13;
The model is designed to contain and handle essential details&#13;
representative of the country's manpower inventories, demand, and&#13;
supplies conditions. It is not overwhelmed by attempting to simulate&#13;
all the details of every event. The model's utility, in fact, resides&#13;
as much in its rejection of inessential details as in its retention&#13;
of essentials.&#13;
To start a manpower forecasting exercise, it is necessary&#13;
to begin with the collection of relevant data which may or may not&#13;
be readily available. If dataate not available, subjective judgement&#13;
must be exercised to provide estimates. This is not an easy task.&#13;
It may just be one of the most difficult steps in the whole exercise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
The forecasting of manpower requirements and supplies is only&#13;
one aspect of the Compound Model applications. Another aspect is the&#13;
evaluation of various manpower oriented strategies. The evaluation of&#13;
the impact of these strategies on manpower and economic development&#13;
would assist decision makers in selecting the most suitable policies.&#13;
The Compound Model can aid in the evaluation and selection process by&#13;
providing analyses of the possible consequences of these strategies.&#13;
Without a comprehensive manpower model, the evaluation and comparison&#13;
of various manpower strategies would almost be impossible.&#13;
Model building involves many different disciplines. How&#13;
effectively one uses the model depends very much on the user's ex-&#13;
perience. It is highly recommended that a team with experience in&#13;
the field of economic, manpower, education, and system analysis be&#13;
assigned to collect data, run the Compound Model, analyze the results&#13;
of the simulation run, and prepare reports and recommendations to be&#13;
submitted to decision makers for action.&#13;
&#13;

'SECTION I&#13;
OVERVIEW OF THE'MODEL'DESIGN&#13;
The Compound Model contains several interrelated submodels.&#13;
The figure on next page presents an overview of the relationships&#13;
among the submodels and of some of the variables contained therein.&#13;
The submodels are:&#13;
(1) Labor Force Model&#13;
(2) Manpower Requirement Model&#13;
(3) Education Simulation Model&#13;
(4) Manpower Policy Model.&#13;
The Labor Force'Model calculates the available labor force&#13;
at the beginning of each simulation year by sectoral/occupational&#13;
categories, including expatriates residing in the country. The stock&#13;
of manpower available is then updated to reflect labor force attrition,&#13;
the supply from the educational system and the net importation of&#13;
expatriates.&#13;
The Manpower Requirements Model accounts for:&#13;
(a) the total manpower requirements to achieve a given&#13;
target output by sector and occupational categories,&#13;
taking into account, if necessary, productivities in&#13;
each sector; and&#13;
&#13;

=oernent  theusermaySishltiou  Model (MPM)&#13;
|Model (ESM)        i&#13;
(b)  the net manpower requirements by sector and&#13;
occupational cstegories after comparing the&#13;
total manpower requirements against the&#13;
available manpower stock.&#13;
It is to be noted that for selected sectors (e.g. Petroleum and&#13;
Goverrnment) the user may wish to use the option of entering manpower&#13;
requirements directly because better data are often available from&#13;
officials in such key sectors than what would be generated by use of&#13;
proJection techniques. Also, teacher requirements may be estimated by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Education Simulation Model, taking into account enroliment figures&#13;
and teacher-student ratios, among other variables. This technique of&#13;
estimating teacher requirements is an optional feature of the model.&#13;
The Education Simulation Model (ESM), originally developed by&#13;
UNESCO, estimates school leavers by age and level. However, not all of&#13;
the school leavers participate in the labor force; some are below the&#13;
legal minimum age to enter the labor force; others do not participate&#13;
because of social, cultural and other reasons. These facts are taken&#13;
into account by introducing a time dependent filter matrix.&#13;
The school leavers who enter the labor force are pooled into&#13;
groupings with similar educational level attainments.&#13;
The Manpower Policy Model compared the net manpower requirements&#13;
against manpower supplies from the educational system, and attempts to&#13;
allocate manpower in accordance with a priority matrix where the priority&#13;
and proportion of nationalization in each sector/occupation are specified&#13;
by policy makers.&#13;
After this has been done, labor policies on importation or&#13;
exportation of expatriates are taken into account by exercizing a linear&#13;
programming feasibility model (as contrasted to an optimization model)&#13;
which operates on policy constraints.&#13;
Finally, a by-product of the system is worth mentioning. The&#13;
system calculates the existing labor force including national and expatriate&#13;
labor already residing in the country, and, at the same time, also calculates&#13;
the manpower supply from the ESM. From this set of data, the system estimates&#13;
the achievable sectoral output based on the existing labor in the country&#13;
without importing additional foreign labor.&#13;

SECTION 2&#13;
SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION&#13;
Purpose&#13;
The purpose of this section is to provide a summary des-&#13;
cription of how to use the Compound Model residing on the George&#13;
1/&#13;
Washington University Computer (IBM 370/1485, The user of the&#13;
Compound Model should be thoroughly familiar with the content of&#13;
this Operational Manual before attempting to run the model.&#13;
Overview of the Compound Model System&#13;
From a user's point of view, the Compound Model system&#13;
looks as depicted in the fieure below:&#13;
MASTER                                              MASTER&#13;
FILE                       COMPOUND                 FILE&#13;
_                      ~~~~~~~MODELl&#13;
INPUTREOS&#13;
CARDS         l_SYSTEM_ REPORTS_&#13;
On the input side (left side of the picture), the Model receives&#13;
input cards and a masterfile containing information which is used&#13;
by the Model to calculate projection data. On the output side, the&#13;
Model presents the calculated data on reports and, optionally, pro-&#13;
duces an updated version of the master file. The computer execution&#13;
of the Compound Model system is conducted serially in six steps:&#13;
EDIT&#13;
PASS5&#13;
LKEDT&#13;
MODEL&#13;
REPORT&#13;
SUMRY&#13;
1/ The only difference in the operation of the Compound Model residing&#13;
on other computer installations is in the format of the IBM Job Con-&#13;
trol Card (see paragraph "IBM System Control Input" in this section).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
The EDIT step reads data from input cards and master file&#13;
and checks for their validity. Any data errors are displayed on the&#13;
Error Messages Report (See Section 4). Major errors cause the computer&#13;
run to be terminated. If this happens, the user must correct the&#13;
errors in the input data and re-submit the run to the computer center.&#13;
The PASS5 step prints all input data (from cards and from&#13;
master file) on the Input Data Report.&#13;
The LKEDT step assembles the programs required by the MODEL&#13;
step in a way that can be used by the computer to run that step.&#13;
The MODEL step performs all projections of the Compound&#13;
Model. These include: Labor Force, Manpower Requirements, Educational&#13;
Systems, and Manpower Policy projections.&#13;
The REPORT step formats the projection data produced by&#13;
the MODEL step and generates all Compound Model reports.&#13;
The SUMRY step collects certain major projection data and&#13;
formats them into the Highlights Report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
Types of Output Produced by the Compound Model&#13;
The following types of output are produced with each Compound&#13;
Model computer run:&#13;
- IBM Job Control Listing (JCL listing)&#13;
- Master File Listing (only if a master file is&#13;
created during the run)&#13;
- Input Data Error Messages Report&#13;
- Input Listing (for both master file and card input)&#13;
- Educational Simulation Model Reports&#13;
- Compound Model Reports&#13;
- Highlights Report&#13;
From a run control point of view, only the first four types of&#13;
reports are of interest, since they provide all the information required&#13;
to ensure that the computer run is executed successfully.&#13;
Types of Input Required to Run the Compound Model&#13;
To run the Model, three types gf input are required:&#13;
- IBM system control input (JCL Cards)&#13;
- Compound Model control input&#13;
- Compound Model data inpkt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
IBM System Control Input&#13;
Three JCL cards are required to run the Compound Model:&#13;
//JOBNAME JOB (800346,N,30,50,30),'USERNAME'&#13;
// EXEC MANPOWER,COPIES=N (where N = number of report&#13;
copies desired)&#13;
1/&#13;
These cards must be the first, second, and last card of the&#13;
input deck.&#13;
Compound Model Control Input&#13;
Four Compound Model control cards are required to run the&#13;
Model. Additionally, two other cards may also be used at the option&#13;
of the user (for a detailed description of the cards content, see&#13;
Section 6 ):&#13;
Required cards:&#13;
CO1: Run Control&#13;
(this card must be placed just after the second JCL&#13;
card in the input deck)&#13;
C02: Run Title&#13;
C03: Years.of Projection&#13;
G05: Report Selection&#13;
Optional cards:&#13;
GO1: Analyst Name&#13;
G06: Report Distribution List&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Compound Model Data Input&#13;
Data input to the Compound Model is punched on the following&#13;
card types:&#13;
DO1 to D20 (Manpower Demand Cards)&#13;
EO1 to E09 (ESM Cards)&#13;
G02 to G04 (Definition Cards)&#13;
G07        (Footnote Card)&#13;
LO1 to L04 (Labor Force Data Cards)&#13;
P01 to P08 (Manpower Policy Cards)&#13;
S01 to S10 (Manpower Supply Cards)&#13;
Detailed description of the cards content are found in&#13;
Section 6.&#13;
Organization of Input Deck&#13;
The organization of the input deck to the Compound Model is&#13;
displayed below:&#13;
JCL Job Card 1st card&#13;
JCL EXEC Card 2nd card&#13;
CO1 Card      3rd card&#13;
All other cards&#13;
//            last card.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Mode&amp; of Operation&#13;
The Compound Model can operate in three modes:&#13;
- Base year run&#13;
- Simulation run&#13;
- Update run&#13;
In a Base Year run (at B-run), all input data on cards are&#13;
transferred to a master file which can be later used for Simulation or&#13;
Updating runs.&#13;
In a Simulation run (S-run), the master file created in a&#13;
Base Year or Updating run is used as input to the Model. Data content&#13;
of the master file can be temporarily changed for a particular run&#13;
only, by using input cards to override master file data.&#13;
In the Updating run (U-run), the master file created in a&#13;
Base Year run or in a previous Updating run is used as input to the&#13;
Model. Data content of the master file is permanently changed by&#13;
using input cards to override master file data (thus, creating a new&#13;
master file).&#13;
After processing the input data as described above, all three&#13;
types of runs perform projections as requested in the Compound Model&#13;
control cards (i.e., cards C03 and G05).&#13;
The type of run is specified in the COI card by punching a B&#13;
(Base year run), or a S (Simulation run), or an U (Updating run) in&#13;
card column 11. (For details please refer to Section 3).&#13;
Important Note: When creating a new file (B or U run), in&#13;
addition to specifying the new file name on the CO1 card (card columns&#13;
12-23), a system programmer must be contacted in order to allocate space&#13;
for the new file in the computer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Checking'the Compound Model Output&#13;
After running the model, the user should check four reports&#13;
to insure that the computer run terminated normally. The reports are:&#13;
- IBM Job Control Listing&#13;
- Master File Listing (B-run and U-run only)&#13;
- Input Data Error Messages Report&#13;
- Input Listing&#13;
IBM Job Control Listing (JVL'Listing)&#13;
This report contains a listing of all JCL statements used in&#13;
the model. An indication of systems failure (abnormal termination) is&#13;
given at the beginning of the report, in the first four or five lines.&#13;
The message is "JOB FAILED." If this message is present, please give&#13;
the entire output to a system programmer. He will help you in locating&#13;
and correcting the error. If the message is not present, then the run&#13;
terminated normally.&#13;
There are two most common reasons for a system failure. The&#13;
first reason is due to IBM control cards errors (JCL errors). This is&#13;
indicated by the message: JOB FAILED - JCL ERROR.&#13;
The second reason is due to the fact that there may not be&#13;
enough space in the computer to run the model. This is indicated by&#13;
the message: JOB FAILED - WAITING FOR ALLOCATION&#13;
Other errors may occur occasionally. However, if they do,&#13;
they all require assistance from a system programmer as mentioned above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Master File Listing&#13;
A listing of the data content of the master file is produced&#13;
only in B or U-runs. When produced, the listing should be checked against&#13;
the input data on cards to make sure that all input has been transferred to&#13;
the master file. If the master file does not contain all input data,&#13;
check the Error Messages Report to determine the cause.&#13;
Input Data Error Messages Report&#13;
Input data (either on the master file or on input cards) that&#13;
do not satisfy the validity checks performed in the EDIT step are printed&#13;
in this report together with explanatory messages (see Section 8). Major&#13;
errors printed on this report cause the run to be terminated. The input&#13;
cards containing the erroneous data must be corrected by using the&#13;
Corrective Action written alongside the error message (see Section 8) and&#13;
the run re-submitted to the computer.&#13;
Input Listing&#13;
All valid data input is formatted for easy reading and printed&#13;
on this report. The user should check the listing to insure that the&#13;
Model has received all the input required for the particular run.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

SECTION 3&#13;
MODES OF OPERATION&#13;
The Compound Model can operate in three modes:&#13;
- Base Year run (B-run)&#13;
- Simulation run (S-run)&#13;
- Update run (U-run)&#13;
The three types of runs differ in that each is treating the&#13;
master file generation and processing in a unique way. However, each&#13;
run type performs projections as requested by the Compound Model input&#13;
data.&#13;
Following is a description of each of the three modes.&#13;
Base Year Run (B-run): The Base Year run requires as input&#13;
a card deck containing the entire set of Compound Model input data.&#13;
The input data cards are edited by the system and stored in&#13;
a master file which is saved for later use. Both valid and non-valid&#13;
data cards are stored in the master file. Each card within a specific&#13;
card type (first three card columns, see Section 5), is automatically&#13;
given a sequence number starting from 001 for the first card of a card&#13;
type to a maximum of 998, in increments of 2 (i.e., 001, 003, 005, etc).&#13;
If there are more than 449 cards in a card type, the remainder of the&#13;
cards will all contain a sequence number of 998. The automatic&#13;
assignment of sequence numbers to input cards is independent of the&#13;
sequence number that might be contained on the input cards (card&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
columns 4 to 6, see Section 5 ) which, for B-runs only, is disregarded&#13;
(i.e., input cards for B-runs could be prepared with blank sequence&#13;
number fields). The Base Year run produces a listing displaying the&#13;
content of the generated master file.&#13;
Simulation Run (S-run):  In a simulation run, the master file&#13;
created in a Base Year run (or during an U.pdate run, see below) is&#13;
used as input. Data content of the master file can be temp6tarily&#13;
changed for a particular run only, by using input cards to override&#13;
master file data.&#13;
When changing the content of the master file, the user must&#13;
use the sequence number as the key to the change.&#13;
Input cards containing a card type and sequence number Ccard&#13;
columns 1 to 6, see Section 5) identical to the card type and&#13;
sequence number of the information in the master file, will replace&#13;
that information.&#13;
Input cards containing a new card type and/or a new sequence&#13;
number which does not exist in the master file, will be insetted in&#13;
the master file.&#13;
Input cards which contain a card type and sequence number&#13;
identical to the card type and sequence number of the information in&#13;
the master file, and which also contain   the keyword "DEL" in card&#13;
columns 7 to 9, will delete that information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
To delete a range of sequence numbers from the master file,&#13;
the user can enter the beginning sequence number of the range in&#13;
card columns 4 to 6, and the ending sequence number in card columns&#13;
11 to 13 (card type, columns 1 to 3, and keyword "DEL", columns&#13;
7 to 9, must also be entered).&#13;
No master file listing is produced by the Simulation run.&#13;
Update Run (U-run): The Update run has the same capabilities&#13;
as the Simulation run. However, the content of the master file is&#13;
permainntly changed by the content of the input cards. The changed&#13;
master file is saved for later use. The old master file (without the&#13;
new changes) is kept untouched and is still available (saved) if needed.&#13;
The Update run produces a listing displaying the content of&#13;
the new (changed) iaster file.&#13;

IBM Job Control Listing (JCL Listing):&#13;
This report contains a listing of all JCL statements used in&#13;
the model. An indication of system failure (abnormal termination) is&#13;
given at the beginning of the report, in the first four or five lines.&#13;
The message is "JOB FAILED". If this message is present, please give&#13;
the entire output to a system programer. He will help you in locating&#13;
and correcting the error. If the message is not present, then the&#13;
run ta terminated normally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
There are two most common reasons for a system failure. The&#13;
first reason is due to IBM control cards errors (JCL errors). This is&#13;
indicated by the message: JOB FAILED - JCL ERROR&#13;
The second reason is due to the fact that there may not be&#13;
enough space in the computer to run the model. This is indicated by&#13;
the message: JOB FAILED - WAITING FOR ALLOCATION&#13;
Other errors may occur occasionally. However, if they do,&#13;
they all require assistance from a system programmer as mentioned above.&#13;
Master File Listing&#13;
A listing of the data content of the master file is produced&#13;
only in B or U-runs. When produced, the listing should be checked&#13;
against the input data on cards to make sure that all input has been&#13;
transferred to the master file. If the master file does not contain&#13;
all input data, check the Error Messages Report to determine the cause.&#13;
Input Data Error Messages&#13;
Input data (either on the master file or on input cards) that&#13;
do not satisfy the validity checks performed in the EDIT step are&#13;
printed in this report together with explanatory messages (see Section 8:&#13;
"Diagnostic Messages"). Major errors printed on this report cause the&#13;
run to be terminated. The input cards containing the erroneous data&#13;
must be corrected by using the Corrective Action written alongside the&#13;
error message (see Section 8) and the run re-submitted to the computer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Input Listing&#13;
All valid data input is formated for easy reading and&#13;
printed on this report. The user should check the listing to&#13;
insure that the model has received all the input required for the&#13;
particular run.&#13;
Educational Simulation Model Report&#13;
This report is always produced in each projection run. It&#13;
includes, for each projection year, enrollment, promotion, repetition,&#13;
and dropout rates, and number of dropouts for each course in the ESM&#13;
structure.&#13;
Compound Model Reports&#13;
The names of the Compound Model reports and their Report&#13;
IDs are listed in the following table. Samples of all reports are&#13;
found in Section 10.&#13;
Compound Model reports are produced on demand for the&#13;
projection years specified on card "C03" and for the report IDs&#13;
specified on card "G05" (see Section 6).&#13;
Highlights Report&#13;
This manpower projections summary report is always produced&#13;
in each run.  For a sample, see Section 10&#13;

SECTION 5&#13;
INPUT - GENERAL DESCRIPTION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The input to the system can be classified into the following&#13;
seven major types:&#13;
Type C: Run control cards, informing the system about the&#13;
type of run being requested.&#13;
Type D:  Manpower demand or requirements cards, informing&#13;
the system about labor demand and methods of&#13;
estimating requirements.&#13;
Type E:  Education simulation cards, specifying educational&#13;
structure, enrollment, intakes, promotion/reQetition/&#13;
dropout rates, etc.&#13;
Type G:  General data cards, defining sector/occupation/&#13;
nationality IDs, reports selection, etc.&#13;
Type L:  Labor force data cards, containing information&#13;
about existing labor force, attrition rates, etc.&#13;
Type P:  Manpower policy data cards, informing the system&#13;
about manpower allocation priorities, extent of&#13;
nationalization, and expatriate manpower con-&#13;
straints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
Type S: Manpower supply cards, informing the system about&#13;
labor force participation patterns, school leavers&#13;
pooling, teacher stock, etc.&#13;
Input cards have been designed to allow the user to enter the&#13;
required data into the system, and to select processing options and methods.&#13;
The specifications and layouts of the cards are described in details in&#13;
Section 6.&#13;
However, before turning to that section, the user should become&#13;
familiar with the general input card format which is described in the&#13;
following paragraphs.&#13;
General Input Card Format&#13;
Although data items vary for each card type, the first ten&#13;
columns of each type contain card identification information which is used&#13;
consistently throughout all input cards.&#13;
The items of information and their location in the cards are&#13;
described below:&#13;
Card Column 1: contains an alphabetic character identifying the card type.&#13;
The valid characters are those listed in the introduction to&#13;
this section.&#13;
Card Columns : contain a two-digit number which further identifies the&#13;
2 and 3&#13;
kind of data pertaining to the card type in column 1. Valid&#13;
numbers are indicated in Section 6 for each input.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Card Columns: contain a three-digit card sequence number to&#13;
4, 5, and 6&#13;
identify further each card in a card type set.&#13;
The valid range of sequence numbers is from&#13;
001 to 998.&#13;
Card Columns: this field is made available to the user for his&#13;
7, 8, 9,&#13;
and 10         own card identification purposes.   Although not&#13;
used by the system, the supplementary identification&#13;
is retained and printed with the content of the&#13;
card whenever an input listing is generated.&#13;
The remaining portion of the card (columns 11 to 80) varies&#13;
in meaning and content depending on the particular card type.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Field Types&#13;
Data fields coded on the input cards are of four different&#13;
types:&#13;
A: Alphabetic&#13;
N: Numeric&#13;
ND: Numeric decimal&#13;
A/N: Alpha numeric&#13;
Alphabetic type data fields may contain the entire repiwtoire&#13;
of characters available in the computer, except the digits 0 to 9.&#13;
Numeric type data fields may contain the diRits 0 to 9, the&#13;
operational signs "+ -", and blanks (see explanatory Note 1 below).&#13;
Numeric decimal type data fields have the same definition as&#13;
numeric types, but they may also contain a decimal point (see expla-&#13;
natory Note 2 below).&#13;
Alphanumeric type data fields may contain the entire&#13;
repertoire of characters available in the computer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Note 1 (Numeric type)&#13;
Assuming that the input card data field is 6 characters long,&#13;
and that the value to be entered is equal to 123, then the field must&#13;
be coded in the following way:&#13;
I              l I12   3 1&#13;
However, preceding blanks may also be coded as zeros:&#13;
i.e.&#13;
f  0    1   2   3&#13;
0        1   2    3&#13;
o            1    2   3&#13;
0   0    1   2    3&#13;
0  0         1    2   3&#13;
0        0   1    2   3&#13;
0   0   0   1   12 131&#13;
Unsigned values are taken as positive.&#13;
(None of the data fields of the Compound Model, as currently&#13;
implemented, allow for the entry of negative values.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Note 2 (Numeric decimal'type)&#13;
Assuming that the input card data field is 6 character long,&#13;
and that the value to be entered is equal to 12.3, then the field may&#13;
be coded in either of the following ways:&#13;
i    1   2      3&#13;
LI 12        3&#13;
That is, the position of the decimal point is immaterial as&#13;
long as it is contained within the data field.&#13;
Furthermore, preceding and/or trailing blanks may be coded&#13;
as zeros without altering the value of the data.&#13;
i.e.        1   2   *   3 T        may also be coded as&#13;
0   1   2       3   0o     or&#13;
1   2       3*  3  0   or&#13;
Unsigned values are taken as positive.&#13;
(None of the data fields of the Compound Model, as currently&#13;
implemented, allow for the entry of negative values.)&#13;

SECTION 6.2.&#13;
CARD TYPE D - MANPOWER DEMAND/REOUIREMENTS CARDS&#13;
The manpower demands/requirements card set contains 14 card&#13;
types ranging from DO1 to D20 as follows: DO1, D02, D03, D05, D06,&#13;
D08 to D14, D19, and D20.&#13;
Card DO1 allows the user to indicate his choice among three&#13;
methods of estimating manpower requirements for each individual&#13;
sector. These methods are:&#13;
i) The Elasticity Method - identified as Method 1.&#13;
ii) The Productivity Method - identified as Method 2.&#13;
iii) The Direct Input Method - identified as Method 3.&#13;
Only one method can be used for any individual sector, but&#13;
various sectors within a country can use different methods. For&#13;
example, it is possible to use the elasticity method (Method 1) for&#13;
the Construction Sector, the productivity method CMethod 2) for&#13;
other Manufacturing Sector, and the direct input method (Method 3)&#13;
for the Petroleum Sector.&#13;
Regardless of the method indicated in DO1 (1,2, or 31, the&#13;
following D cards must be prepared:&#13;
Must Cards&#13;
DO1 - Method of Manpower Requirement Estimation&#13;
D02 - Base Year Sectoral Output&#13;
D20 - Sector/Occupation Distribution Matrix&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
If Method 1, the elasticity method, is selected, three cards&#13;
in addition to the three must cards should be prepared:&#13;
D10 - expected annual GNP growth rates&#13;
D13 - sectoral elasticittes&#13;
D14 - base year sectoral employment&#13;
When Method 2, the productivity method, is selected, three&#13;
cards in addition to the three must cards should be prepared.&#13;
These are:&#13;
i) D08 - base year sectoral productivity&#13;
ii) choose one among three possible approaches to enter&#13;
sectoral output for the years beyond the base year as&#13;
follows:&#13;
( D03 - if sectoral output is to be entered for each year&#13;
(&#13;
c       of projection Cstreaming)&#13;
Select   (&#13;
C D05 - if sectoral output growth rates are used&#13;
One   (&#13;
( D06 - if interpolation is to be used to calculate&#13;
(       sectoral output between base year and final&#13;
(       year of projection&#13;
iii)  Choose one among three possible approaches to enter&#13;
sectoral productivity for the years beyond the base year.&#13;
( D09 - if productivity is to be entered for each year&#13;
C    8 of projection (streaming)&#13;
Select    ( Dll - if productivity growth rates are used&#13;
One   ( D12 - if interpolation is to be used to calculate&#13;
(        sectoral productivity between the base&#13;
(       year and final year of projection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
When using Method 3, direct input, two cards in addition to&#13;
the three must cards, should be prepared. They are:&#13;
D03 - sectoral output for each year of projection (streaming)&#13;
D19 - sector employment for each year of projection (streaming).&#13;

The entire set is always required in any projection runs.&#13;
Note: If, for instance, the Base Year is 1975, the base year enrollment&#13;
is that for academic year 1975/76.&#13;

Relationship Between Adademic Years and Projection Years&#13;
The Compound Model has been structured to accept input&#13;
data by way of cards and to display output data in the reports&#13;
on a nominal calendar year basis, the treatment of academic year&#13;
data, therefore, requires a note of explanation. The following&#13;
example will illustrate appropriate handling of this matter.&#13;
If 1975 is chosen as the base year for the simulation,&#13;
then'1975 should be entered as the base year on the EOl card. For&#13;
the E03 card (base year enrollment), the academic year 1975/76 enrollments&#13;
are entered. The rationale is that the majority of the education system&#13;
output (dropouts and graduates not proceeding to any follow-on course)&#13;
in the academic year 1975/76 becomes available to the labor force in 1976.&#13;
For the E06 card (PRDD and repetition/dropout rates), the year&#13;
1976 is equated with the academic year 1975/76. In other words, the rates&#13;
specified for 1976 will operate on the 1975/76 enrollment specified in&#13;
the E03 card.&#13;
For the E07 card (entrance rates/levels), the year 1976 would&#13;
refer to the academic year 1976/77; 1977 would refer to the academic year&#13;
1977/78, etc. The intake for the academic year 1975/76 is implicit in the&#13;
base year enrollments already entered on E03 cards.&#13;
For the E08 and E09 cards, the academic year 1975/76 would be&#13;
referred to as 1976, and 1976/77 as 1977, etc.&#13;

CARD TYPE: EO1&#13;
CARD NAME: ESM Control&#13;
PURPOSE :&#13;
The EO1 card specifies to the system certain control&#13;
information required to execute the ESM model. The information&#13;
are:  base year; total number of courses in the ESM structure&#13;
number of age groups; the dummy course numbers, if any, assigned&#13;
to males and females who never attend school; ranee of cottrse&#13;
numbers for males; and range of course numbers for females.&#13;
NUMBER OF CARDS      One card&#13;
REQUIRED/OPTIONAL: Required&#13;
NOTES,&#13;
The base year must be identical to the base year&#13;
specified on the C03 card.&#13;
Maximum number of courses allowed is 300 (including&#13;
dummy courses for males and females who never attended schooly&#13;
Age groups are defined in the ESM model as: N-1, N,&#13;
N+l, N+2, N+3, N+4, where N is the ideal age. (i.e., maximum of&#13;
six age groups).&#13;

CARD TYPE: E07&#13;
CARD NAME: Entrance Rates/Levels&#13;
PURPOSE:&#13;
The E07 card allows the user to enter intake of students&#13;
into several courses, by year and age group. The-number of age&#13;
groups must be specified in card "EO1".&#13;
NUMBER OF CARDS: One or more cards&#13;
REQUIRED/OPTIONAL: Required (see notes)&#13;
NOTES:&#13;
Age groups: N-1, N, Ntl, N+2, N+3, N+4 where N_ldeal Age&#13;
Maximum number of courses- 300&#13;
The intakes entered in the card apply to that year and to&#13;
subsequent years until replaced by another E07 card containing the&#13;
new year in columns 11-14.&#13;
Intakes expressed in number of students is the preferred&#13;
method.&#13;
If base year is (for instance) 1975, the intakes for 1976&#13;
(first projection year) should be-those for the academic year 1976/77.&#13;

CARD TYPE: E08&#13;
CARD NAME: Population Data&#13;
PURPOSE :&#13;
The E08 card allows the user to enter population data or&#13;
population growth rates for each year of projection.&#13;
NUMBER OF CARDS   : One or more cards&#13;
REQUIRED/OPTIONAL: Required for first projection year.&#13;
NOTES,&#13;
If population value is greater than 2.0, it is considered&#13;
a total number.&#13;
If population value is greater than 0.0 and less than or&#13;
equal to 2.0, it is considered a fraction of last year population&#13;
(one year younger).&#13;
If population equals 0.0, the last year population number&#13;
or fraction is carried forward to the current year.&#13;
E08 cards must be prepared for the ages specified in the&#13;
ESM structure on cards "E04" (taking into account the age groups),&#13;
starting from age = 1.&#13;

Population Data Card (E08):&#13;
This set of cards is used-to supply the population or projected growth rate of the population on an annual basis. The lowest and the highest ages&#13;
supplied are equal to the lowest and i;ighest ages in the educational structure.  The population must be supplied in each year of the simulation period.&#13;
certain year is applied to that year and the year following it until it is replaced by another distribution in a later year.&#13;

CARD TYPE: L02&#13;
CARDT) Fk'T National Labor Force Attrition&#13;
PUPPOSE&#13;
The L02 card allows the user to specify attrition rates for&#13;
national labor force by projection year, and by sector/occupation.&#13;
The sector/occupation IDs entered on this card must be defined in&#13;
cards "G02" and "G03". Sector/occupation IDs must be coded exactly&#13;
as they appear on cards "G02" and "G03".&#13;
NUMBER OF CARDS : One or more cards&#13;
REQUIRED/OPTIONAL: Required for first projection year.&#13;
NOTES,&#13;
If attrition rates are not entered for specific sectors/&#13;
occupations, those rates are assumed to be zero.&#13;
If attrition rates are different from year to year, they&#13;
must be entered each year.&#13;
Rates entered for a particular year will be used for sub-&#13;
sequent years if L02 cards for subsequent years are not present.&#13;
If "ALL" is entered for a sector ID, all sectors of a&#13;
given occupation will use the same attrition rate.&#13;
If "ALL" is entered for an occupation ID, all occupations&#13;
of a given sector will use the same attrition rate.&#13;
If "ALL" is entered for both sector and occupation IDs, all&#13;
sectors/occupations will use the same attrition rate.&#13;
Maximum and minimum values for attrition rates are 1.0 and&#13;
0.0 respectively.&#13;

CARD TYPE: L04&#13;
C_RD _NAM: Expatriate Labor Force Attrition&#13;
The L04 card allows the user to specify attrition rates&#13;
for expatriate labor force by projection year, and by sector/&#13;
occupation/nationality. The sector/occupation/nationality IDs&#13;
entered on this card must be defined in cards "G02", "G03", and&#13;
"G04". Sector/occupation/nationality IDs must be coded exactly&#13;
as they appear on cards "G02", "G03", and "G04".&#13;
NUMBER OF CARDS   * One or more cards&#13;
REQUIRED/OPTIONAL: Requi-red for first projection year.&#13;
NOTES&#13;
If attrition rates are not entered for specific sector/&#13;
occupation/nationality, those rates are assumed to be zero.&#13;
If attrition rates are different from year to year, they&#13;
must be entered each year.&#13;
Rates entered for a particular year will be used for sub-&#13;
sequent years if LO4 cards for subsequent years are not present.&#13;
If "ALL" is entered for a sector ID, all sectors of a given&#13;
occupation/nationality will use the same attrition rate.&#13;
If "ALL" is entered for an occupation ID, all occupations&#13;
of a given'sector/nationality will use the same attrition rate.&#13;
If "ALL" is entered for a nationality ID, all nationalities&#13;
of a given sector/occupation will use the same attrition rates.&#13;
If "ALL" is entered for sector/occupation/nationality IDs&#13;
all sectors, .occupations, and nationalities will use the same rate.&#13;
Maximum and minimum values for attrition rates are 1.0 and&#13;
0.0 respectively.&#13;

SECTION 6.7.&#13;
CARD TYPE S - MANPOWER SUPPLY CARDS&#13;
The manpower supply cards allow the user to:&#13;
- define labor force participation patterns; school&#13;
leavers pooling; teacher stock, and attrition rates;&#13;
- define minimum legal age to work; underage school&#13;
leavers; and underage labor force participation;&#13;
- define teacher entrance qualifications by teacher&#13;
groups; and&#13;
- enter any other additional national labor forces that&#13;
are not accounted for by the education structure.&#13;
The set of cards comprises the following card types:&#13;
SO1 to S10.&#13;
Card types SO1 to S08 are always required in any projection&#13;
runs. Card types S09 and S10 are optional.&#13;
Card S04: Steps involved in computing the number of dropouts of&#13;
yesteryears who were below the legal age of entry into&#13;
the labor market prior to the base year.&#13;
1.  Establish the base year.&#13;
2.  Establish the ideal age of entry into the first grade.&#13;
3.  Establish the legal age of entry into the labor market.&#13;
4.  Compute the number of years immediately preceding the&#13;
base year for which dropout data will be needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -&#13;
) Legal Age of Entry into the labor&#13;
Number of years one needs )&#13;
) market minus ideal age of entry&#13;
to go back for dropout data)&#13;
) into the first grade&#13;
Example:  Base year is 1975, Legal Age of Entry into the&#13;
labor market is 15 and the Ideal Age of Entry&#13;
into the first grade is 6. Then, the number of&#13;
years one needs to go back is 15 - 6      i 9&#13;
i.e., 1974-75, 1973-74, 1972-73, 1971-72, 1970-71,&#13;
1969-70, 1968-69, 1967-68, and 1966-67.&#13;
5. The number of grades yielding the dropouts to be included&#13;
in this exercise is the same as the number of years one&#13;
needs to go back from the base year, i.e., 9 in the above&#13;
example. In other words, for the set of assumptions made&#13;
in the example above, one would need information on stu-&#13;
dents dropping out from grades 1 to 9 during years&#13;
1966-67 to 1974-75, separately for males and females,&#13;
but not from all grades in each of the above years, as&#13;
explained below.&#13;
6.  Obtain the number of students who dropped out of the lowest&#13;
grade in the earliest year of the time span defined in 4.&#13;
above, i.e., from grade 1 in 1966-67 in this example.&#13;
Unless information is available on the age distribution&#13;
of these dropouts, estimate the number of 5 year olds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -&#13;
who  dropped out of grade 1 in 1966-67   , i.e., ideal age&#13;
of entry minus one group. If the age distribution of&#13;
neither the enrollees in grade 1 in 1966-67 nor the&#13;
dropouts from it is available, one can use the corres-&#13;
ponding age distribution available for the year closest&#13;
to 1966-67 assuming that the age distribution of enroll-&#13;
ment in a grade does not usually change significantly&#13;
from one year to another, and that the pupils dropout from&#13;
all age groups represented in a grade in more or less&#13;
the same proportion.&#13;
7. Obtain the number of students who dropped out of grade 1 and&#13;
grade 2, respectively, during the next following year,&#13;
i.e., 1967-68. For grade 1 dropouts, obtain or estimate&#13;
the numbers who were 5 years old and those who were 6&#13;
2/&#13;
years old , i.e., ideal age of entry minus one group and&#13;
ideal age of entry group. For grade 2 dropouts, obtain&#13;
or estimate the numbers representing ideal age of entry&#13;
2/&#13;
minus one group (6 years old7&#13;
Anyone dropping out of grade 1 in 1966-67 who was then 6 years old&#13;
or older will have reached minimum legal age of entry into the&#13;
labor market in the base year, and is, therefore, not included in&#13;
these calculations.&#13;
Anyone seven years old or older in 1967-68 is of age 15 CLegal&#13;
age of entry into the labor market) in the base year 1975, and&#13;
is, therefore, not included in these calculations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 166 -&#13;
8. Obtain the number of students who dropped out of grades&#13;
1, 2, and 3, respectively, during the next following&#13;
year, i.e., 1968-69. Among the first grade dropouts,&#13;
obtain or estimate the numbers representing ideal age&#13;
minus one, ideal age and ideal age plus one groups, i.e.&#13;
5, 6, and 7 year olds. Among the second grade dropouts,&#13;
obtain 6r estimate the numbers representing ideal age&#13;
minus one and ideal age groups, i.e., 6 and 7 year olds,&#13;
Among the grade three dropouts, obtain or estimate the&#13;
numbers representing the ideal age minus one group,i.e.,&#13;
7 year olds&#13;
9.  The pattern is now clear.   For each succeeding year one&#13;
more grade is included and the cut-off age is increased&#13;
by one year. In 1974-75, dropouts from grades 1 to 9&#13;
are considered ranging from ideal age minus one group&#13;
for grade 9, i.e., 14 year olds; ideal minus one ar.d&#13;
ideal age group for grade 8, i.e., 13 and 14 year olds;&#13;
ideal minus one, ideal and ideal plus one age group for&#13;
grade 7, i.e., 12, 13 and 14 year olds; and so on, inclu-&#13;
ding one more age group for each lower grade dropout until&#13;
all six age groups have been included.&#13;
10. Group the dropouts by the grades they dropped out from,&#13;
showing their age at dropout time along the columni and&#13;
the year of their dropping out along the rows, as shown&#13;
in Table 1 for grade 1 dropouts. Each cell of the matrix&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
containing x represents a number computed in steps 6 to&#13;
9 above. Sulmming along the diagonals provides totals&#13;
Cthe right most column of the table) by age in the base&#13;
year, of those who dropped out of grade 1. Similar&#13;
tables can be constructed for dropouts from grades 2, 3,&#13;
4, 5, 6 , 7 , 8, and 9. For each higher grade, the&#13;
matrix will have one less column (losing the left most&#13;
column) and one less row Closing the top most row); for&#13;
example, for grade 2 dropouts, age will range from 6 to&#13;
14 and years from 1966/67 to 1974/75.&#13;

11. The ten tables produced above Cone each for dropouts&#13;
from grade 1 to 10) can now be consolidated into one&#13;
table as shown below where each x in a cell represents&#13;
a diagonal total obtained in step 10 above. One addi-&#13;
tional column is added for "never entered school". Note&#13;
that if ideal age of entry is six for first grade, the&#13;
age series will begin at six,&#13;

SECTION 7&#13;
SAMPLE'COMPUTER'RUN'SET'UP&#13;
This section describes the typical input data required in a&#13;
projection run. The input data can be classified into two categories:&#13;
IBM computer system control cards and Compound Model'input cards.&#13;
The IBM Control Cards   are referred to as JCL or Job Con-&#13;
trol Language cards. This set of cards are installation dependent&#13;
and vary from installation to installation. A list of JCL cards&#13;
required to run the model as installed on the George Washington&#13;
University IBM system oNashington D. C.) is presented in this section.&#13;
However, the user does not have to enter the entire set of&#13;
JCL cards each time he runs a projection, since the JCL set can be&#13;
saved permanently on IBM system files. All he should need to enter are&#13;
the three following cards:&#13;
1/&#13;
//JOBNAME JOB (800346,N,30,50,30),'USERNAME'&#13;
1/ EXEC MANPOWER, COPIES*n (where n-number of reports copies&#13;
desired)&#13;
//&#13;
These cards must be the first, second, and the last card of&#13;
the input deck.&#13;
1/   The JOBNAME card is installation dependent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 200 -&#13;
The Compouwid-Model - i   cttards  have been described in&#13;
prior sections. The entire set must be inserted in the input deck&#13;
after the "EXEC MANPOWER" JCL card and before the "//" JCL card.&#13;
Notice thatv`the "COl" card must be the-first card of the Compound&#13;
Model input set.&#13;
In summary, the organization of the input deck to the&#13;
Compound Model is:&#13;
JCL "JOB" Card            1st card&#13;
JCL "EXEC" Card           2nd card&#13;
CO1 Card                  3rd card&#13;
C02 to S10 Cards          Following 3rd card&#13;
JCL "//" Card             Last card&#13;

SECTION 9&#13;
SAPLE INPUT&#13;
The data cards listed in this section are for a sample run&#13;
of an economic model eonsisting of three private and one public&#13;
sectors, each containing three occupational categories.&#13;
Manpower supplies for the economy come from existing labor&#13;
force, from manpower supplied by the educational system, and from&#13;
manpower supplied by importation of labor from two expatriate groups.&#13;
The school system described in the sample is composed of&#13;
111 courses and six teacher groups. The school leavers that are avai-&#13;
lable for the labor force, are collected into five pools, from which&#13;
needed manpower is drawn. Distribution of school leavers is determined&#13;
by national priorities and the desired fraction of nationalization by&#13;
sector and occupation is inpit to determine the allocation of pooled&#13;
school leavers to the labor force.&#13;
The output from the sample run is presented in Section 10,&#13;

            The Country (Compound) Model is one of a
            set of simulation models developed during a research project
            to study the implications of the explosion of international
            migration in the Middle East and North Africa Region for
            both labor-importing and labor-exporting countries. The
            models have been applied to study manpower problems and
            planning issues in several countries and was proven to be a
            useful tool. This user's guide describes the input,
            output, use, and operation of the model, which is a manpower
            forecasting model, implemented for IBM 370 systems.
