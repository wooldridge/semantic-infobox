                           Alisbah, Bilsel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by W. Becker and D. Milobsky, on 1993-12-20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Alisbah joined the Bank as part of the first group of the Young&#13;
Professionals (YP) program. At that time, according to him, not too&#13;
much thought had as yet been given on how to use them within the&#13;
institution. He mentions the present complaints of Executive Directors&#13;
and some in Management that the managers who came through the YP&#13;
program are short on exposure to the real world. According to Alisbah,&#13;
the YP program seems to have met its objective in developing a cadre&#13;
of future executives for the institution, since a good portion of&#13;
today's managers came through this YP group. On the other hand, some&#13;
of the criticisms were legitimate as the institution had become too&#13;
inbred, and employment criteria had not been modified in keeping with&#13;
the pace of the outside world. He then gives his ideas on designing a&#13;
management program to identify future managers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Alisbah started in the technical part of the Bank which was a&#13;
central unit at the time. He later joined the India Division and&#13;
worked both as an economist and a loan officer. He talks of the Bank's&#13;
shift in the '70s from infrastructure to 'softer' sectors&#13;
(agriculture, education, and health care), its emphasis on the&#13;
agriculture sector in India, consulting outside experts such as Sir&#13;
John Crawford in trying to formulate projects, and opines on the&#13;
Indians as borrowers. He then covers his experience in West Africa&#13;
beginning in '79, and more specifically, Ghana and the Rawlings&#13;
regime, Nigeria, and his involvement with the River Blindness program.&#13;
By the late '80s he was country director in West Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Alisbah addresses the reorganization of 1987, beginning with its&#13;
merits in bringing up the country focus as a whole, including the idea&#13;
&amp;#12;of having country directors. He then covers its demerits and the&#13;
legacy of distrust it left between Management and Staff, the&#13;
consequences of which were still being felt, according to him. Alisbah&#13;
mentions the reasons he thought were instrumental when offered in 1989&#13;
the position of Vice President, Personnel Administration, his&#13;
objectives, especially in the aftermath of the '87 reorganization, and&#13;
his accomplishments while in that position. He explains the workings&#13;
of the compensation system in the Bank, his role therein, and its&#13;
critical handling in light of the constantly tense interaction between&#13;
Management and the Board. Alisbah then turns to staffing and&#13;
recruitment in the Bank, including staff diversification and areas&#13;
where this is affected by the compensation system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Alisbah talks of the controversy that surrounded the construction&#13;
project of the new building [now known as the Main Complex], and&#13;
details the mistakes made which he believes were compounded by the&#13;
deteriorating relationship between Management and the Board. In that&#13;
context, he runs a comparison between Presidents Conable and Preston.&#13;
He concludes in briefly talking of the Narmada project in India, the&#13;
controversies that plagued it, and the lessons to be learned from such&#13;
a project, especially in dealing with NGOs.&#13;
