EMERGENCY EDUCATION RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A. Background&#13;
Units of Government and their Roles in Education&#13;
1.             Education in former Yugoslavia was highly decentralized. Municipalities were&#13;
responsible for primary education; regions were responsible for secondary education; republics&#13;
were responsible for higher education. The functions of republic and regional governments were&#13;
reduced further during the war, as budgets disappeared and as staff were mobilized for the war&#13;
effort. The 1994 Federation Constitution creates eight regional cantons, and assigns to them&#13;
responsibility for all education functions. The Federation explicitly permits the cantons to&#13;
delegate education functions upward to the Federation or downward to municipalities, and&#13;
requires that educational functions be delegated downward to municipalities which are&#13;
predominately of an ethnic group other than the majority ethnic group in the canton. Because&#13;
only two cantons are yet operational, a number of educational functions will need to be delegated&#13;
to other levels of government.!'&#13;
2.             In the medium term, it is desirable that careful thought be given to the educational&#13;
responsibilities which are appropriate to the various levels of government, and the financial&#13;
resources which need to go with them. For efficiency reasons in a country as small as Bosnia-&#13;
Herzegovina (BH), such functions as curriculum development, textbook development, and quality&#13;
control should be administered at the State level. But for practical reasons, political reconciliation&#13;
between the two State entities -- and even between the two Federation partners -- will need to&#13;
progress further before this desired integration can occur fully. Once they are fully established,&#13;
the cantons may play an important role in functions such as pedagogical inspection, in-service&#13;
teacher training, and introduction of new teaching methods. Day-to-day management of primary&#13;
schools and most secondary schools should probably be the responsibility of municipalities, but&#13;
local financial resources will need to be supplemented with resources from the entity or State level&#13;
in order to maintain quality standards in a situation of sizeable local and regional disparities in&#13;
income.&#13;
Pre-war education system&#13;
3.             Prior to the start of hostilities, Bosnia-Herzegovina had a well-developed&#13;
education system, financed by public expenditures accounting for about 6 percent of GDP.&#13;
Virtually all children completed the eight-year primary cycle; most also completed the four-year&#13;
secondary cycle. As elsewhere in the region, most secondary education was offered in the form&#13;
of narrowly specialized vocational education programs, oriented to the needs of industry. Higher&#13;
education was offered through four universities, comprising 46 institutes and faculties. Higher&#13;
education enrollments emphasized science and engineering. There were no fees for higher&#13;
education for Yugoslav nationals; foreign students paid tuition. In primary, secondary, and&#13;
higher education, students were responsible for purchasing their own textbooks.&#13;
1/     The Project is expected to help create implementation capacity at the canton level by implementing the two&#13;
largest components at the regional level. Where they exist -- notably, in Tuzla and Bihac -- the cantons will perform&#13;
this role. Where cantons have not yet been formally established, these components will be implemented with informal&#13;
regional associations of municipalities. The institutional strengthening which is to be provided to these bodies under the&#13;
Project is expected to help transform them into functional cantons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Wartime Impact on the Education Systemz'&#13;
4.             Physical Plant. All aspects of education have been severely disrupted by the&#13;
war. Well over 50 percent of school buildings in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been seriously&#13;
damaged or destroyed, or taken over for use by the army or to house people displaced by the&#13;
war. In the remaining space available, students and teachers face classrooms with no glass in the&#13;
windows and no heat; classes are even held in rooms missing walls and doors As schools were&#13;
destroyed or unsafe, each school as an administrative entity was responsible for finding alternative&#13;
space in the neighborhood for classes - often, in apartments, basements, shelters, garages, or&#13;
abandoned offices. These "war schools" still exist in most front-line areas, and wherever schools&#13;
were destroyed. To accommodate students displaced by destroyed schools and the influx of&#13;
displaced persons, most schools function in two or three shifts of 3 1/2 hours, and offer&#13;
instruction in a very abbreviated class year -- 18 weeks at most, instead of the 38 weeks called for&#13;
in the curriculum.&#13;
5.             Teaching Staff. The Ministry of Education, Science, Culture, and Sports of the&#13;
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (MOE) has tried to keep the system functioning under&#13;
impossible circumstances. It is operating on a skeleton staff, and there has been no regular&#13;
budget for education since the 1991-92 academic year. Teachers are working essentially without&#13;
compensation in the Bosniac-majority areas, while teachers in the Croat-majority areas have&#13;
received partial salaries throughout the conflict period. An undetermined number of qualified&#13;
teachers have been lost through migration, mobilization into the military, and war casualties.&#13;
Many teachers currently in the classroom are wartime volunteers, and lack pedagogic training.&#13;
The MOE has collected data on available teachers and qualifications, revealing severe shortages of&#13;
teachers in languages, math and science.&#13;
6.             Textbooks and Educational Materials. The availability of textbooks and&#13;
educational materials varies between the Croat-majority and Bosniac-majority areas of the&#13;
Federation. Croat majority areas have been relatively well-supplied with textbooks provided by&#13;
the Croatian Government, and are also relatively well-provisioned with basic educational materials&#13;
provided by parents, communities and the schools themselves. In the Bosniac areas, many&#13;
schools lack even the most basic educational materials needed for effective learning such as&#13;
notebooks, pens and chalk. The Federation Pedagogic Institute published and distributed 56 new&#13;
textbook titles in 1994 in history, culture, reading and Bosnian language with the support of&#13;
various donors. Textbooks in natural sciences and math for both primary and secondary&#13;
education have not been made available to schools in over four years, which represents the&#13;
average life of a textbook printed in the former Yugoslavia. School libraries have also been&#13;
destroyed and depleted during the war, and students in Bosniac-majority areas lack basic reading&#13;
material. It is unlikely, in the short term, that the two partners in the Federation will agree to use&#13;
commnon textbooks, but common usage of basic readers and educational materials should be&#13;
possible.&#13;
7.             Although the Federation Ministry of Education is in the process of updating its list&#13;
of approved textbooks for the Bosniac-majority areas, it has not yet taken a broader, long term&#13;
view of its policy for textbook production and financing, which is closely related to needed&#13;
reforms in curriculum structure and content. A preliminary analysis of the current situation is&#13;
that there are too many textbooks required for too many specialized subjects. There is almost&#13;
certainly scope to reduce the number of books required and to improve their pedagogic content&#13;
and coverage. At the same time, the Federation will need to develop a medium-term policy for&#13;
2/     Detailed information on the wartime impact on the education system in the Republika Srpska was not available&#13;
at the time of appraisal. Information on war-related reconstruction needs is being prepared by RS officials for the&#13;

producing textbooks using private-sector publishers and printers, and for financing textbooks&#13;
through some form of cost recovery. The few textbooks that are available have been provided&#13;
free of charge to schools, which lend books to students during the school year. Textbooks were&#13;
provided to students free of charge in the former Yugoslavia. Given the current situation in&#13;
Bosniac-majority schools and the limited ability of parents to cover costs in the short term, getting&#13;
basic textbooks, readers and educational materials into classrooms, particularly in the natural&#13;
sciences and math, is an urgent priority which cannot be put on hold until the longer-term policy&#13;
work is completed.&#13;
8.            Schools and Enrollments. Reliable data on education in the Federation of&#13;
Bosnia-Herzegovina are scarce for several reasons: a) political fragmentation within the&#13;
Federation and parallel structures make it difficult to cross-reference the available data; b)&#13;
difficult access to certain areas hampers data collection and assessment of the current situation;&#13;
and c) in some areas, the situation changes from day to day as a result of the war-related refugee&#13;
movements. Thus, basic educational statistics will need to be refined in the early stages of the&#13;
recovery effort.&#13;
9.            It is clear, however, that access to education in Bosnia has been severely limited.&#13;
Between 1990 and 1995, primary enrollments in the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina reportedly&#13;
declined by over 50 percent -- from 542,000 to 255,000; secondary enrollments also declined by&#13;
over 50 percent -- from 168,000 to 82,000; higher education enrollments declined from 35,000 to&#13;
about 18,000. These figures understate the true disruption for many schools -- which have&#13;
suffered frequent changes of teachers and students, changes of premises, deprivation of the most&#13;
basic learning materials, and the recurring trauma of violence and its personal consequences. The&#13;
most current education statistics available for the Federation, organized by level of education and&#13;
by ethnic group, are presented in Appendix 6.&#13;
10.           School Damages. War damage to school infrastructure is extensive. The&#13;
Ministry of Energy and Industry has prepared a general assessment of total school reconstruction&#13;
needs at each level of education in the Federation, net of furniture and equipment needs. The&#13;
assessment shows that over 50 percent of both primary and secondary schools have sustained&#13;
damage during the war and that over 30 percent of all schools have sustained significant damage&#13;
(more than 15 percent needing refurbishment). Official estimates of war damages for all levels of&#13;
education are presented in Appendix 7. It is also estimated that about 50 percent of schools do&#13;
not have basic desks and chairs for teachers and students.&#13;
B. Bank Response and Recovery Strategy for Education&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Program&#13;
11.           Education governance in Bosnia-Herzogovina is currently in a state of flux,&#13;
making decisions and coordination between levels -- entities, cantons, municipalities, and schools&#13;
-- difficult (paragraphs I and 2). Logistical constraints to communication and political tensions&#13;
add to the difficulties. However, education sector reconstruction cannot be put on hold until these&#13;
issues are resolved. The Federation Ministry of Education has placed great emphasis on&#13;
encouraging communications and cooperation among canton and municipality-level authorities --&#13;
for example, to develop practical mechanisms for allocating investment financing and operating&#13;
funds within the country. Preparation of the proposed Project for emergency reconstruction has&#13;
helped to facilitate contacts between the Federation MOE and the cantons/municipalities. The&#13;
same is expected for the Republika Srpska. Implementation of the Project should be an important&#13;
vehicle for continued cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
12.           Because of the current state of flux in education governance, reconstructing the&#13;
education sector will be difficult to plan, as well as to implement. The Government and donors&#13;
realize that addressing all priority programs at the same time and in a well-coordinated manner is&#13;
simply not possible under current constraints. Flexibility and communication on the part of the&#13;
Government and donors will be key to implementing an effective investment programs in&#13;
education in the near term. As part of preparations for the Brussels donor conference in&#13;
December, the broad goals of a reconstruction program for education were agreed. The highest&#13;
priority objectives are to make fully functional those classrooms which were damaged by the war,&#13;
to restore effective teaching capacity by providing minimal supplies of textbooks, supplementary&#13;
readers, and educational materials, and to support the resumption of at-least minimal salaries for&#13;
teachers. The priority within the school reconstruction program is to start with efforts which&#13;
would restore effective classroom teaching fastest and at the least cost. At the same time, the&#13;
MOE will attempt to build its own institutional capacity to manage and coordinate the&#13;
rec instruction effort and to deal with longer-term policy issues.&#13;
13.           Although the Government's emphasis now is rightly on emergency reconstruction&#13;
needs, government authorities and donors have identified a number of key policy issues which&#13;
will necessarily have to be addressed in parallel with the provision of emergency reconstruction&#13;
support. In addition to the overall governance issue mentioned above, these include the&#13;
appropriateness of curriculum and content for education in Bosnia and Herzegovina, textbook&#13;
production and financing, and the structure of secondary and adult education. As in other&#13;
education systems of the region, there is an inherited legacy of over-specialization in secondary&#13;
technical and vocational education, an excessively specialized and ideology-laden curriculum, and&#13;
outdated teaching and learning methodologies. Structural reforms are needed, particularly at the&#13;
secondary level, to reorient education in Bosnia to the requirements of a modern market economy&#13;
and post-Communist society. The Ministries of Education of the two entities are aware of the&#13;
need to introduce systemic reforms and will, for the time being, take the lead in working with&#13;
external assistance in these crucial areas. Eventual implementation of initiatives concerning broad&#13;
education reform will, of course, need to await a resolution of governance issues. In the&#13;
meantime, emergency support is being focused on providing core textbooks and basic learning&#13;
materials to teachers and students.&#13;
14.           An education reconstruction program of about US$250 million is currently under&#13;
consideration by the international donor community to support the above priorities. Of this total,&#13;
US$189 million is for activities in the Federation; the balance represents estimated reconstruction&#13;
needs in the Republika Srpska. This program is part of the three-year, US$5.1 billion&#13;
reconstruction program for all sectors which the Bank and the European Community (EC) have&#13;
helped to develop in a joint effort with the Government and the donor commnunity. It is expected&#13;
that some of these needs will be met by a continuation of current donor assistance, the future&#13;
costs of which are included in the figures in Table 1.&#13;

15.           Confirmed financing for the priority areas listed above falls far short of needs. In&#13;
particular, resources have not been forthcoming to assist BH with needed salary and school&#13;
operating cost support, and BH is reluctant to borrow even on concessional IDA terms to cover&#13;
these costs. Although it will not be possible in the near term to mobilize the same absolute level&#13;
of recurrent expenditures prevailing in 1990 (about US$400 million per year), it is essential to&#13;
begin to restore funding for teachers' salaries and other vital operational expenditures at all levels&#13;
of education. The share of total recurrent needs for education which require donor financing is&#13;
expected to decline over the initial three years, as local resource mobilization improves.&#13;
IBRD/IDA Assistance Strategy&#13;
16.           To date, education reconstruction efforts on the part of the Government and&#13;
donors have been on a relatively small scale and ad hoc in nature, reflecting the plethora of&#13;
urgent needs and multiplicity of donors and the difficult environment for planning, implementing&#13;
and coordinating specific investments. In this context, the Bank has decided, in consultation with&#13;
the Government and key education donors, to support education reconstruction with a series of&#13;
investment projects to be implemented over a three year period which can be designed to respond&#13;
quickly as political tensions decrease, more hard information becomes available and governance&#13;
and policy issues are resolved. This first Emergency Education Reconstruction Project is focused&#13;
on mneeting emergency needs which will allow primary education in the country to operate at&#13;
minimum acceptable standards. It will also provide assistance to allow the MOE to begin to&#13;
address some of the key policy issues outlined above. A second and eventually a third education&#13;
project will provide resources to continue reconstruction in primary education, as well as begin to&#13;
rebuild secondary facilities in the context of a broader secondary reform program. The latter two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
projects will also provide support for two priority areas -- teacher training and remedial education&#13;
for war disruption -- for which sufficient information and implementation capacity was not&#13;
available to include in a first emergency project. These projects will gradually shift in terms of&#13;
their objectives from emergency reconstruction to longer term development priorities. Significant&#13;
co-financing and parallel financing is needed for all three projects.&#13;
17.           Although it is vitally important to restore teachers' salaries as soon as possible, it&#13;
is not proposed to support them unless the Government develops a feasible plan for payment, and&#13;
unless other sources of donor financing are identified. Initial needs for minimal teachers' salaries&#13;
are estimated at US$20 million for BH in the first year. Donor financing for teacher salaries, if&#13;
confirmed, would be included in the second education reconstruction project, to be implemented&#13;
in parallel with the proposed Emergency Education Reconstruction Project.&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description&#13;
18.           The primary objective of the Project is to support Bosnia and Herzegovina's&#13;
efforts to restore the delivery of primary education of acceptable quality during the 1996-97&#13;
school year. A secondary objective is to help build capacity for planning and implementation of&#13;
education programs at the State, entity, canton, and municipality level.&#13;
19.           To achieve these objectives under the prevailing constraints, this first Emergency&#13;
Education Reconstruction Project focusses on meeting immediate educational needs in primary&#13;
schooling which can, for the most part, be put in place prior to the start of the next school year in&#13;
September, 1996. The Project will support actions to enable primary schools throughout the&#13;
Federation to operate at minimum acceptable educational standards, and will prepare for similar&#13;
actions in the Republika Srpska (RS). The Project will support the rehabilitation of a first tranche&#13;
of lightly damaged primary schools throughout the Federation which have been identified by&#13;
municipality and cantonal authorities as being of the highest priority for reconstruction, and the&#13;
reconstruction of destroyed schools in a limited number of cases where no alternative capacity&#13;
exists. It will also provide essential textbooks, supplementary reading materials, and other&#13;
educational materials to most primary classrooms throughout the Federation, and will support&#13;
actions to begin to strengthen the Federation's capacity to implement education programs at all&#13;
levels of government. These actions will benefit a broad cross-section of communities throughout&#13;
the Federation. Project resources are to be allocated to cantons throughout the Federation on the&#13;
basis of population; project resources are to be allocated within cantons on the basis of local&#13;
priorities for education reconstruction.&#13;
20.            Although it was not possible to assess reconstruction needs and capacity in the&#13;
Republika Srpska during the period when the proposed Project was prepared and appraised, it is&#13;
expected that the RS will participate in the next stage of reconstruction for the education sector in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to ensure that the RS is ready to participate in donor-financed&#13;
projects at the State level and to help make up for time lost due to the embargo, financing is&#13;
provided under this Project to enable authorities in the RS to assess education reconstruction&#13;
needs, and to prepare and pilot education reconstruction actions which would be supported under&#13;
subsequent donor-financed education reconstruction projects.&#13;
21.            Project costs are estimated at US$32.8 million. Individual components are&#13;
described below. Detailed cost tables are included in Appendix 1. Implementation and&#13;
institutional responsibilities are described in Section D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Primary School Reconstruction&#13;
22.            This component will provide financing for (i) the refurbishment of about 70 large&#13;
primary schools (estimated cost, US$18.0 million); (ii) the construction of about three&#13;
replacement primary schools (estimated cost, US$3.0 million); (iii) the provision of furniture for&#13;
classrooms in these schools (estimated cost, US$2.0 million); and (iv) design and management&#13;
assistance (estimated cost, US$2.3 million). The reconstruction represents about 18 percent of the&#13;
Federation's estimated primary school reconstruction needs. A description of the process and&#13;
criteria used to select schools to benefit from reconstruction and refurnishing is provided below.&#13;
Construction will be carried out by local construction contractors to be selected on a competitive&#13;
basis. Architectural designs and specifications will be developed by the MOE's implementation&#13;
management agent, the International Management Group (IMG) (see Section D), using local&#13;
contractors; this work will be financed on a grant basis by the EU.&#13;
23.            Selection of Primary Schools for Refurbishment and Replacement. Schools&#13;
have been selected and agreed with the Bank for refurbishment and reconstruction under the&#13;
Project under the following procedure. (A list of the specific schools selected for rehabilitation&#13;
and reconstruction under the Project is available upon request.) The initial selection was carried&#13;
out on the basis of the Government's strategy to focus initial reconstruction support for education&#13;
on schools which can be rapidly rehabilitated, thereby restoring education facilitates to the&#13;
greatest possible number of students for the 1996-97 school year. As the agency responsible for&#13;
overseeing the school reconstruction process at the Federation level, the MOE took the lead in&#13;
defining criteria for selecting schools and reaching agreement on the criteria with the Bank, as&#13;
well as for working with canton-level education ministries and other education authorities (in the&#13;
cases where canton-level ministries are not yet formed) to apply the criteria to the needs of the&#13;
various municipalities. During February 1996, the MOE requested canton-level authorities to&#13;
identify the primary schools in their areas which: (i) had sustained light to medium war-related&#13;
damage or deterioration; (ii) were not benefiting from or expected to benefit from other donor&#13;
financing; and (iii) could be refurbished to allow students to attend classes during the 1996-97&#13;
school year. It also asked for supplementary information which would allow it to further&#13;
prioritize schools to benefit from financing in this first Project. This information included student&#13;
and teacher numbers (both trained and untrained teachers), numbers of classrooms (both in use&#13;
and currently not usable), and a brief description of rehabilitation work to be carried out. In&#13;
addition, canton authorities were asked to propose the replacement of fully destroyed or otherwise&#13;
unusable schools only if these schools could be justified on the basis of: (i) the number of students&#13;
without access to any school facility; and (ii) evidence that the population of the catchment area is&#13;
stable, such as comparisons with the former population of the area and the availability of&#13;
permanent housing.&#13;
24.            Authorities were asked to request school furniture only in cases where basic&#13;
furniture such as blackboards, desks and chairs for students and teachers, small shelves and book&#13;
cupboards did not exist for an existing classroom or one to be refurbished or constructed under&#13;
the program. Replacement of old or partially damaged furniture will not be included in this first&#13;
phase.&#13;
25.            Once this information was received from individual cantons, the MOE used the&#13;
agreed criteria and supplementary information to bring funding proposals in line with funds&#13;
expected to be available under the first-year school rehabilitation program (about US$20 million).&#13;
Schools not selected for this first phase of reconstruction would be eligible for financing in second&#13;
and third phase lending operations. Balance between funds made available to the various cantons&#13;
was also sought on a per-capita basis. The MOE, in cooperation with its implementation agent,&#13;
IMG (see implementation arrangements in Section D), will verify all information provided by the&#13;
canton level prior to beginning competitive selection of construction contractors and furniture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
suppliers. Changes to the original list of schools to benefit from the program may be made at&#13;
that time.&#13;
26.           Refurbishment costs have been estimated by the MOE and canton authorities to be&#13;
about US$400 per square meter on average and the average cost for new construction of&#13;
replacement schools is estimated to be US$800 per square meter. These costs are high, reflecting&#13;
both elevated materials pricing during the war, and a lack of knowledge of post-war construction&#13;
costs. It is expected that IMG's participation in the verification process and the use of&#13;
competitive selection will lead to a reduction in the actual square-meter costs. Canton authorities&#13;
would be invited to reallocate any cost savings within their cantons to undertake work on priority&#13;
schools that were not selected from their original requests due to lack of funds, thereby providing&#13;
an incentive for economy in square-meter costs. The cost of school furniture is estimated to be&#13;
US$4,000 per classroom, based on a classroom size of 32 per class. This estimate is based on&#13;
recent experience with furniture manufacturing in Bosnia.&#13;
Books and Educational Materials&#13;
27.           This component (estimated cost US$6.1 million) will finance the printing of&#13;
textbooks and the purchase and printing of supplementary readers for primary and secondary&#13;
education, as well as basic educational materials packages for primary schools. This material is&#13;
expected to be delivered to schools for the 1996-97 school year. Titles selected for production&#13;
and delivery under the Project are principally in science, math, and literature; textbooks and&#13;
readers covering controversial subject matter -- particularly, in areas such as history and&#13;
geography -- are not provided under the Project. The average unit cost for textbooks is estimated&#13;
to be US$4 and the average unit cost for readers is estimated to be US$3. Educational materials&#13;
are estimated to cost US$130 per classroom package.&#13;
28.           The Federation MOE is in the process of completely updating its list of approved&#13;
textbooks. Beginning in 1993, it organized two competitions in which authors were invited to&#13;
submit manuscripts against a list of standard subjects for both primary and secondary education.&#13;
The manuscripts were evaluated and selected by committees established by the Federation MOE.&#13;
The first selection of 56 textbooks, which cover Bosnian history, language and culture, were&#13;
printed in Slovenia using donor financing and distributed to schools in Bosniac-majority areas in&#13;
1994. A second list of 72 textbooks have been submitted to donors for financing covering a&#13;
broader range of subjects. These books have not been accepted for use in Croat majority areas&#13;
where textbooks are imported from Croatia. Educational authorities in Sarajevo and Mostar are&#13;
cooperating to investigate the use of a limited number of common textbooks for use throughout&#13;
the Federation, which could be financed in a second phase. For this Project, eight supplementary&#13;
reader titles, but no text titles were selected in common by educational authorities for both&#13;
Federation partners. Priority in selection was given to primary-level textbooks and science and&#13;
math books for general secondary education. More specialized secondary texts were excluded,&#13;
pending a review of the structure and content of secondary education in Bosnia.&#13;
29.           A total of 84 textbook titles have been selected and agreed with the Bank for&#13;
printing under the Project. (A list of these textbook titles is available upon request.) These&#13;
manuscripts are currently being readied for printing by the Federation MOE under co-financing&#13;
provided by the Government of the Netherlands. The total cost of textbook production under the&#13;
Project is estimated at US$2.8 million. Textbooks will be printed by private printing houses&#13;
selected under international shopping procedures; most, but not all printers invited to submit bids&#13;
will be local. All books to be printed with proceeds from this Project will be included in the&#13;
Federal MOE's approved list of textbooks. Print runs are estimated to be approximately 35,000&#13;
for a general primary text, and 6,000 for a general secondary text.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
30.          Fifty-four supplementary readers were selected and agreed with the Bank for&#13;
inclusion under the Project, from a list of 92 existing books which represents the Federation&#13;
MOE's list of recommended literature for all primary and secondary grade levels. The list, which&#13;
is available upon request, includes international translations, as well a selection of local authors&#13;
from all ethnic groups in the region. The final selection of supplementary readers for the Project&#13;
was based on the availability of readers for delivery to schools by September, 1996. The total&#13;
cost of printing and purchasing supplementary readers is estimated to be US$1.3 million. Readers&#13;
will be procured off-the-shelf from publishers and/or printed using international shopping&#13;
procedures.&#13;
31.          A minimum package of pedagogic materials for primary schools such as basic&#13;
student supplies, teaching aids and maps was prepared by the Federation MOE with the support of&#13;
UNICEF, and agreed with the Bank. The materials will be procured locally to the extent that&#13;
they are available at a reasonable price and quality. Materials that cannot be purchased locally&#13;
will be procured through UNICEF's educational equipment procurement facility (UNIPAC).&#13;
Packages will be made available to each primary school in the Federation on the basis of the&#13;
number of classrooms in the school. The Federation has approximately 10,000 classrooms.&#13;
However, classrooms where double and even triple shifting is expected during the 1996-97 school&#13;
year will receive proportional shares of consumables. The total cost of primary school&#13;
pedagogical packages is estimated to be US$1.8 million.&#13;
32.          Distribution of all books and materials packages will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Federation MOE in cooperation with canton-level education authorities. The capacity of these&#13;
agencies to handle distribution was proven in that they successfully distributed the 56 national&#13;
subject textbooks printed in 1995 using their own resources. As an alternative, the Bank has&#13;
agreed that delivery of books to canton-level warehouses can be included in the printing contracts,&#13;
or procured locally on a competitive basis. UNICEF has also volunteered to provide vehicles on&#13;
a grant basis to help with distribution, upon written request from the Federation MOE.&#13;
Project Implementation and Capacity Building&#13;
33.          This component would finance support to assist the Federation MOE and its&#13;
canton-level authorities, or its equivalent where cantons are not yet fully operational, to&#13;
implement the Pproject, as well as support to help the Federation MOE begin to address long-&#13;
term policy issues and improve its own capacity to manage the education sector.&#13;
34.          Technical assistance for project implementation and capacity building is being&#13;
provided on a grant basis by the European Community Humanitarian Organization (ECHO), by a&#13;
Trust Fund established by the Government of the Netherlands, and on a grant basis by the World&#13;
Bank. The ECHO grant will finance the support of IMG (see implementation arrangements in&#13;
Section D), which will work closely with the Federation MOE and canton-level authorities to&#13;
facilitate implementation of the school rehabilitation component. The cost of IMG's assistance for&#13;
18 months is estimated at US$800,000; it is included in the reconstruction component. In&#13;
addition, grant financing from the Government of the Netherlands in the amount of US$500,000&#13;
will be used to provide project management technical assistance, training, and operating costs to&#13;
establish a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) within the Federation MOE. The roles of both IMG&#13;
and technical assistance for the PCU are described in Section D below.&#13;
35.          Support for policy development and capacity building will be provided in the form&#13;
of grant financing from the Government of the Netherlands, to be executed by the World Bank&#13;
(not included as part of project costs). These funds will be used to allow staff from the&#13;
Federation and canton-level MOEs to benefit from technical assistance in four key policy areas:&#13;
(i) education governance and finance, (ii) reform of secondary and adult education, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
associated teacher training at the tertiary level, (iii) textbook production and financing, and (iv)&#13;
teacher training. In addition to this technical assistance support, the Project will finance office&#13;
equipment and logistical support for the Federal MOE and canton-level MOEs, as well as for the&#13;
PCU. Support would include vehicles, office equipment and minor operating costs. The total&#13;
base cost of this equipment and support is estimated at US$500,000.&#13;
Project Preparation and Pilot Implementation in the Republica Srpska&#13;
36.           This component will provide US$500,000 to finance: a) consultant services to&#13;
help assess education reconstruction needs, and b) consultant services, civil works, and equipment&#13;
to prepare and pilot education reconstruction actions -- including the provision of textbooks,&#13;
readers, and educational materials -- for primary schools in the Republika Srpska.&#13;
37.           In order to prepare itself to be included in future donor-financed projects financed&#13;
through the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, officials at the Republika Serbska's Ministry of&#13;
Education will need to provide State authorities and donors with detailed information on the status&#13;
of its education system and the nature and extent of reconstruction needs, as well as estimates of&#13;
reconstruction costs and proposed implementation arrangements. To facilitate this process, the&#13;
proposed Emergency Education Reconstruction Project will finance technical assistance,&#13;
equipment, and operating costs -- estimated at a total cost of US$100,000 -- to help establish a&#13;
Project Coordination Unit (PCU), similar to that being established by the Federation MOE. The&#13;
PCU will be responsible for preparing needed information and presenting it to the State and donor&#13;
community in time for the Republika Srpska to be included in the next education reconstruction&#13;
project for Bosnia and Herzegovina, scheduled for appraisal early in the summer of 1996. As in&#13;
the Federation, assessment of education reconstruction needs will need to be carried out in close&#13;
collaboration with education authorities at the cantonal and municipal level. The proposed Project&#13;
will also finance pilot activities in school rehabilitation in the Republika Srpska (estimated to cost&#13;
US$250,000), and provision of textbooks, readers, and educational materials to schools in the&#13;
Republika Srpska (estimated to cost US$150,000). These pilot activities will both develop and&#13;
demonstrate implementation capacity as a basis for larger-scale implementation in subsequent&#13;
projects. As in the portion of the Project to be implemented in the Federation, the emphasis in&#13;
this component is expected to be on primary schools in order to maximize the potential number of&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
38.           Project Costs. The total cost of the Emergency Education Reconstruction Project&#13;
is estimated at US$32.8 million, including physical contingencies of 10 percent on works. No&#13;
price or physical contingencies have been included, given the expected short disbursement period&#13;
of this emergency Project. The Project is expected to disburse over a 24 month implementation&#13;
period. Project costs are presented in Appendix 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
39.               Financing Plan. The proposed Project would be financed from  a combination of&#13;
sources. Of the total project cost of US$32.8 million, US$5.0 million would be a grant from the&#13;
Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and US$5.0 million would be proposed for IDA&#13;
financing following the commencement of lending to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Grant financing&#13;
under the TFBH would be allocated to the first three components of the Project in order to start&#13;
implementation of those components as soon as possible. Eventual IDA financing would be used&#13;
to supplement this TFBH grant financing -- and other cofinancing -- for the first three&#13;
components, as well as to support implementation of the fourth component of the Project.&#13;
Cofinancing from the European Community Humanitarian Organization (ECHO) in the amount of&#13;
US$2.3 million and from the Government of the Netherlands in the amount of US$0.5 million has&#13;
already been confirmed. Additional donor financing of US$20 million is being actively sought.&#13;
At the Brussels II pledging conference on April 12-13, 1996, several donors expressed interest in&#13;
supporting the Government's priority reconstruction needs in the education sector. Discussions&#13;
with these donors are underway to secure firm commitments to fill the project financing gap. If&#13;
the necessary financing is not found to fill the gap, the school rehabilitation component and, if&#13;
necessary, the books and educational equipment component, would be scaled down to fit available&#13;
resources.&#13;

40.               Taxes. World Bank funds will be used to procure specified project inputs, net of&#13;
taxes. The Government is expected to waive import taxes and duties for purchases under the&#13;
proposed Project, in view of the project's humanitarian objectives. Retroactive financing of 10&#13;
percent of the Grant for eligible expenses incurred after January 31, 1996 (but not more than four&#13;
months prior to signing) and carried out under agreed procedures.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
41.                 Because the Project is not expected to have any adverse environmental impact,&#13;
the Project has been assigned to Environmental Category C. Hazardous materials such as&#13;
asbestos will not be used in school construction or rehabilitation under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
D. Institutional Arrangements and Implementation&#13;
Project Organization and Implementation&#13;
42.           The Federation Ministry of Education (MOE) will be responsible for&#13;
implementation of the first three components of the Project, in collaboration with education&#13;
authorities at the cantonal and municipal levels, municipality public works authorities, and NGOs&#13;
where appropriate. The Ministry of Education of the Republika Srpska will have similar&#13;
responsibilities for implementation of the fourth component of the Project.&#13;
43.           To ensure timely and efficient project implementation, a Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) will be created in the Federation MOE to manage implementation of the first three&#13;
components of the Project. The PCU would provide logistical support to the technical teams of&#13;
the Federation MOE responsible for carrying out activities defined under the Project. The PCU&#13;
will be headed by the Project Director, and supported by a professional Management and&#13;
Procurement Advisor, with experience managing Bank-financed investment projects and a&#13;
thorough knowledge of World Bank procurement guidelines, as well as a bilingual&#13;
secretary/translator. The MOE has designated technically responsible staff members for each of&#13;
the three components to join the PCU. The PCU will have the following responsibilities: (i)&#13;
overall project coordination, day-to-day management, monitoring and progress reporting of&#13;
project activities; (ii) overseeing the implementation of the civil works component, with the&#13;
support of IMG (see paragraph 49); (iii) overseeing the delivery of educational materials&#13;
packages, with the support of UNICEF; (iv) procuring school furniture, textbooks, readers, and&#13;
office equipment; (v) identifying and procuring technical assistance and training opportunities&#13;
under Government of the Netherlands Grant financing; (vi) managing project funds, including&#13;
opening and maintenance of a Special Account in a commercial bank, making payment for works,&#13;
goods and services for all components of the Project, and requesting withdrawal of funds from the&#13;
credit and trust fund accounts (including managing the financing of other potential donors, and&#13;
project accounting); and (vii) maintaining appropriate records as the basis for periodic project&#13;
audits.  As part of his/her terms of reference, the PCU Management and Procurement Advisor&#13;
would also be responsible for training counterpart staff in project management, procurement, and&#13;
accounting. These staff would be available to participate in the implementation of subsequent&#13;
education reconstruction projects. The PCU Management and Procurement Advisor would be&#13;
nominated by the MOE and terms of reference agreed prior to establishment of the PCU,&#13;
expected in May 1996. The cost of the PCU, including technical assistance, training and&#13;
operating costs, will be financed under a government-implemented Trust Fund financed by the&#13;
Government of the Netherlands. The MOE will provide office space for the PCU; supporting&#13;
equipment will be financed under the Project. A PCU will be established under similar&#13;
organization and procedures in the Republika Srpska MOE to manage implementation of the&#13;
fourth component of the proposed Project, as well as implementation of subsequent donor-&#13;
financed education reconstruction activities in the Republika Srpska.&#13;
44.           Technical staff seconded to the PCU will be responsible for overseeing work in&#13;
the cantons and municipalities on their respective components, and will work closely with&#13;
agencies providing implementation assistance (see specific components below). Each functioning&#13;
canton or association of municipalities will appoint an individual who will act as a counterpart at&#13;
the canton level. If responsible staff of the MOE leave their function or are otherwise unavailable&#13;
to carry out their responsibilities, the MOE has agreed to nominate replacements within one&#13;
month.&#13;
45.           A Project Launch Workshop is to be organized by the PCU prior to Grant&#13;
effectiveness. In addition to the authorities of the Federation MOE, this workshop will involve all&#13;
responsible staff at the national, cantonal and municipal levels. The purpose of the workshop will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
be to: (i) review the project concept and activities; (ii) confirm the role and responsibilities of&#13;
each level of authority and implementation; (iii) confirm the location of facilities to be supported&#13;
under the Project in accordance with the agreed criteria; and (iv) finalize and agree on the&#13;
implementation schedule. Within 30 days following the launch workshop, a procurement&#13;
workshop involving all persons concerned with procurement, including the PCU and the&#13;
Management Advisor, will be organized by the PCU to review, explain, and assign&#13;
responsibilities for the procurement procedures set forth under the Project.&#13;
46.           Following is a description of the implementation arrangements and institutional&#13;
responsibilities for each component. A detailed implementation schedule for all components is&#13;
provided in Appendix 2.&#13;
47.           Primary School Reconstruction. It has been agreed with the Federation MOE to&#13;
use the services of IMG, which are being financed on a grant basis by ECHO, to help manage the&#13;
construction process. The primary school construction component will be managed by the&#13;
Federation MOE's Chief Architect, assigned on a part-time basis to the PCU. The Chief&#13;
Architect will be responsible for overseeing the work of IMG and coordinating the work to be&#13;
performed by canton and municipal-level authorities in line with the implementation schedule&#13;
contained in Appendix 2. IMG will be responsible for carrying out the following activities on&#13;
behalf of the PCU: a) verify school rehabilitation priorities, as proposed by the cantons, b)&#13;
prepare specifications and cost estimates for school rehabilitation, c) engage local architectural&#13;
firms to prepare site-specific designs for schools selected for rehabilitation and reconstruction, d)&#13;
formnulate bid packages for school rehabilitation and reconstruction, and prepare bidding&#13;
documents, e) evaluate bids, recommend bid awards, and negotiate contracts, and f) supervise&#13;
implementation of school rehabilitation. 1MG has extensive prior experience in the required&#13;
functions, and is currently organized and staffed in all cantons. IMG will summarize progress in&#13;
a brief monthly report to be submitted to the PCU and will also prepare a final report of&#13;
accomplishments once works have been completed. Furniture procurement will also be the&#13;
technical responsibility of the Chief Architect at the PCU, who will define specifications and&#13;
coordinate procurement of furniture in cooperation with canton-level educational authorities.&#13;
48.            Books and Educational Materials. Implementation of this component is to be&#13;
managed by the Federation MOE's Chief Editor, assigned on a part-time basis to the PCU. The&#13;
Chief Editor will be responsible for assuring content, quality and acceptability of textbooks and&#13;
educational materials, while maintaining the implementation schedule for this component (see&#13;
Appendix 2). The Chief Editor will be responsible, with the support of the Management Advisor,&#13;
for organizing the competitive selection of printing firms/book suppliers for selected textbooks&#13;
and readers (see Section C for a description of selection process) and for organizing their delivery&#13;
to canton-level warehouses. Canton authorities have the capacity for distributing books to&#13;
schools, and will be responsible for distribution of textbooks, readers, and educational materials&#13;
to schools under the Project.&#13;
49.            Project Implementation and Capacity Building. Technical responsibility for&#13;
implementation of this component has been assigned to the Director of the MOE's Pedagogical&#13;
Institute. This individual will be responsible for overall policy dialogue and consensus building&#13;
among all parties working towards a definition of priorities for Bosnia's education system,&#13;
consistent with the implementation schedule for this component (see Appendix 2). The Director&#13;
will take responsibility, with assistance from the Management and Procurement Advisor, for&#13;
identifying technical support, external training opportunities, and equipment needs. The Director&#13;
will act as the chief liaison between the MOE and the technical assistance agencies financed under&#13;
the Bank-executed trust fund financed by the Government of the Netherlands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
50.          Project Preparation and Pilot Implementation in the Republika Srpska. Once&#13;
the PCU has been established in the Republika Srpska, it is expected to use the criteria already&#13;
established in the Federation to select two or three damaged primary schools for rehabilitation.&#13;
Under project financing, the PCU would engage an architectural firm to prepare designs and&#13;
supervise construction, and would engage one or more contractors to carry out the rehabilitation.&#13;
IMG or another suitably qualified consultant may assist in the management of these tasks. The&#13;
PCU would also identify a limited number of textbooks, supplementary readers, and/or&#13;
educational materials which are needed in RS primary schools, and would prepare a plan for&#13;
procuring and distributing these materials to schools most in need. Selection of these materials&#13;
within the available resources would be made on the basis of the same criteria which have been&#13;
developed for the Federation. For textbooks and supplementary readers, the Project could finance&#13;
pre-printing costs, printing, and delivery to warehouses and schools. For educational materials, it&#13;
could finance the purchase and delivery of educational materials. In view of the severe time&#13;
constraint -- aiming for delivery to schools by the start of the 1996/1997 school year -- these&#13;
would need to be purchased largely from existing stocks.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
51.          Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below and a procurement&#13;
plan is attached in Appendix 3. Project procurement is to be mainly through Simplified National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (SNCB), Limited International Bidding (LIB), International Shopping (IS),&#13;
National Shopping (NS) and Direct Contracting (DC).&#13;
52.           Advertising. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) (Appendix III) will be&#13;
published in Development Business in April/May 1996. The notice would include information&#13;
about the nature of the goods, works and services to be procured and invite interested and eligible&#13;
suppliers, contractors and consultants to send their expression of interest to the PCU. The GPN&#13;
will also be published in the local press. The GPN will be followed by specific advertisements in&#13;
the local press for individual contracts. Bidding documents will be sent to suppliers who respond&#13;
to the GPN and the specific advertisement. Expression of interest will also be used to prepare&#13;
Limited International Bidding lists.&#13;
53.           Goods. Goods will be procured under the Project through the following&#13;
procedures:&#13;
a.    International Competitive Bidding (ICB). It is envisaged that ICB&#13;
procedures will not be utilized for the procurement of goods or services,&#13;
since it is not expected that any single contract would reach the US$5.0&#13;
million equivalent threshold.&#13;
b.     Limited International Bidding (LIB). Although it is unlikely that any&#13;
procurement packages for goods in the Project would exceed US$2.0&#13;
million, any goods packages estimated to cost over US$2.0 million would&#13;
be procured by LIB, tendering by invitation. As presented in Appendix 3,&#13;
it is expected that all procurement packages for goods will be under the&#13;
US$2.0 million threshold, and will therefore be procured through&#13;
International Shopping (IS), National Shopping (NS), or Direct&#13;
Contracting (DC).&#13;
c.    International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for&#13;
equipment and materials or standard-specification commodities estimated&#13;
to cost between US$200,000 and US$2.0 million per contract. IS will be&#13;
based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
from two eligible countries, in accordance with Bank guidelines. In the&#13;
case of book and educational materials printing and/or provision, IS will&#13;
be used to ensure that local pricing is internationally competitive. A&#13;
portion of the minimum educational materials packages may be procured&#13;
for the MOE directly by UNICEF through their procurement agent,&#13;
UNIPAC.&#13;
d.     National Shopping (NS). NS will be used for contracts for goods&#13;
available in Bosnia Herzegovina up to an estimated cost of US$200,000&#13;
per contract, with at least three quotations.&#13;
e.     Direct Contracting (DC). DC will be used for proprietary items, for&#13;
reasons of compatibility and standardization, and in any other justified&#13;
case. Any direct contracting to be financed by the proceeds of the Grant&#13;
will need prior Bank approval.&#13;
54.           Recurrent Costs/incremental Operating Costs.  Recurrent Costs and&#13;
Incremental Operating Cost items will be procured as follows: Limited PCU technical support&#13;
will be procured on a sole-source basis. Office supplies and other services will be procured&#13;
through NS or IS, according to the availability of required items in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and&#13;
the size of the procurement packages, and will follow the provisions set for NS and IS.&#13;
Proprietary items such as periodicals will be procured through DC with local companies.&#13;
55.           Works. Given the nature of civil works under the Project, mainly rehabilitation&#13;
of existing facilities and replacement of small primary school facilities, Simplified National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (SNCB) will be used for contracts estimated to cost up to US$1.0 million&#13;
per contract. These works will be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on&#13;
the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified contractors in response to a written&#13;
invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of works, including basic&#13;
specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the&#13;
Association, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor&#13;
who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and&#13;
resources to successfully complete the contract within the specified time period. Any school&#13;
construction contracts estimated to cost more than US$1.0 million but less than US$5.0 million&#13;
would be awarded on the basis of advertised National Competitive Bidding. The contracting&#13;
industry was well established throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina prior to the war. The&#13;
experience of IMG and NGOs involved in reconstruction activities during the war indicates that&#13;
much of this capacity still exists or could readily be revived. Thus, the civil works for school&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction under the Project is expected to be carried out in the customary&#13;
manner -- through contracts with commercial construction enterprises. In the unlikely event that&#13;
contracting for rehabilitation of particular schools or groups of schools proves impractical -- for&#13;
example, if all bid prices are excessive or if local contracting capacity is insufficient -- and if staff&#13;
with the requisite skills are available in the municipalities concerned, rehabilitation of those&#13;
schools could be carried out by Force Account, with prior Bank approval.&#13;
56.           Services. Services under the Project will be procured through competition and&#13;
sole-sourcing where and when appropriate. Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals for&#13;
comprehensive packages of consultant services and management of fellowships and training in&#13;
accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). To keep the evaluation process manageable,&#13;
no more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited following a short listing acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
57.          Procurement Implementation Capacity. In addition to the procurement&#13;
assistance which is to be provided by IMG for the school rehabilitation and reconstruction&#13;
component, procurement assistance will be provided by suitably qualified international and local&#13;
consultants for the other project components. For the textbook and educational materials&#13;
component, UNICEF will assist the Federal Ministry of Education to identify funding priorities,&#13;
and will help procure educational materials locally and, if necessary, through its educational&#13;
equipment procurement facility in Copenhagen (UNIPAC). If necessary, the PCU will engage a&#13;
procurement advisor satisfactory to the Bank to assist in procurement of school furniture,&#13;
textbooks, readers, and educational materials. Similar arrangements will be made in the&#13;
Republika Srpska for implementation of the fourth component of the Project. General support for&#13;
procurement and other aspects of project implementation will be provided by staff of the Bank's&#13;
Resident Mission in Sarajevo, including a human resources operations officer and procurement&#13;
adviser. Supervision assistance will also be provided by human resources staff from Headquarters&#13;
and from the Bank's Human Resources Hub in Budapest.&#13;
58.          Procurement Review Committee. There are plans for establishment of a generic&#13;
Procurement Review Committee at the State level to ensure that externally financed reconstruction&#13;
projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina comply with agreed procurement procedures. The proposed&#13;
Emergency Education Reconstruction Project would be subject to review by this Committee.&#13;
59.          Prior and Post Bank Review of Procurement Documents. The Bank has&#13;
prepared the invitation to quote and contract documents for International Shopping, Simplified&#13;
Bidding documents for NCB and a National Shopping document for civil works. These&#13;
documents would be used under the Project. Prior review will be required for all contracts&#13;
procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB) and Direct Contracting (DC), and all&#13;
activities to be carried out under Force Account. Also, the first three contracts awarded through&#13;
International Shopping (IS), National Shopping (NS), Simplified National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(SNCB), National Competitive Bidding (NCB), and through UN Agencies, will require prior&#13;
review from the Bank. For consulting services, individual contracts of US$50,000 or more and&#13;
consulting firm contracts of US$100,000 or more will require prior review by the Bank. All&#13;
consultant contracts will follow the Bank's standard form for consultants contracts. Ex-post&#13;
review of procurement actions on a sample basis would be carried out during supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
60.          Disbursement categories and projected disbursements under the Grant are shown&#13;
in Table 5, below. The Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of 24 months from the&#13;
date of effectiveness, scheduled for May 1996. The closing date will be September 30, 1998.&#13;
Although the capacity of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to pre-finance activities is&#13;
very limited, the possibility of retroactive financing should not be excluded. Therefore,&#13;
retroactive financing will be permitted up to the limit of 10 percent of the portion of the Grant to&#13;
be implemented in the Federation for eligible expenses incurred after January 31, 1996 (but not&#13;
more than four months prior to signing).&#13;

TOTAL                5.00&#13;
61.          Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, payments for&#13;
agreed project actions are to be made from a Special Account in US dollars which is to be&#13;
established, maintained, and operated by the State Ministry of Finance at a foreign commercial&#13;
bank acceptable to the Bank. Responsibility for making payments from the Special Account&#13;
would be delegated by the State and Federation Ministries of Finance to the PCU of the&#13;
Federation's MOE. The authorized allocation of the Special Account would be limited to&#13;
US$1.0 million, representing about four months of estimated average expenditures expected to be&#13;
paid from the Special Account. Replenishment applications would be forwarded to the Bank&#13;
monthly and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate documents.&#13;
For large contracts, the Bank would make direct payments to suppliers.&#13;
62.          Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) for goods and civil works contracts of up to US$1.0 million (with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
exception of the first three contracts less than US$1.0 million, the first 3 contracts through a&#13;
U.N. agency, and all direct contracting); for contracts for consulting firms and individuals of up&#13;
to US$100,000 and US$50,000, respectively; and all training and individual operating cost.&#13;
Detailed documents evidencing expenditures would be maintained in a central location by the&#13;
PCU for review by the required audit as well as Bank supervision missions. Disbursement for&#13;
contracts requiring the Bank's prior review would be made against presentation to the Bank of full&#13;
contract documentation. The Project completion date would be March 31, 1998.&#13;
Project Audits, Accounting and Reporting&#13;
63.           Accounts. Separate and auditable accounts would be established and maintained&#13;
by the two PCUs for project. For each entity, these accounts would include: (i) a record of&#13;
withdrawals with copies of all disbursement requests and underlying documentation; and (ii) a&#13;
record of transactions under the Special Account and copies of the bank statements pertaining to&#13;
the account.&#13;
64.           Audits. The project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
and under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. Separate audit statements would be&#13;
prepared for the Special Account and for Statements of Expenditures. All audit reports would be&#13;
made available to the Bank at the latest six months after the end of the fiscal year. Project&#13;
accounts would be maintained for one year after they have been audited.&#13;
65.           Reporting. The project PCUs will prepare and furnish to the Bank quarterly: a)&#13;
progress reports showing the status of implementation of the Project, and b) financial reports in a&#13;
format acceptable to the Bank. Participating cantons/municipalities would submit quarterly to the&#13;
respective PCUs a very brief progress report on their project activities. In addition, IMG will&#13;
provide separate monthly progress reports on the implementation of the Primary School&#13;
Reconstruction Component, detailing implementation progress at the canton and municipality&#13;
level, as well as a final report following completion of the component.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
66.           Project implementation will require a large degree of flexibility in view of the&#13;
rapidly changing circumstances in the country. In particular, procurement and disbursement&#13;
issues would require intensive supervision, given the flexibilities built into the implementation&#13;
plan, and the lack of familiarity of the Borrower with Bank procedures and practices.&#13;
Implementation progress would be formally evaluated at mid-term, approximately nine months&#13;
after effectiveness. To facilitate flexibility and rapid decision-making, the social sectors Bank&#13;
staff located in the World Bank Resident Mission in Sarajevo and in the Human Resources Hub in&#13;
Budapest would provide intensive supervision of initial project implementation, and would provide&#13;
prompt feedback on matters requiring a decision by the Bank.&#13;

GENERAL PROCUREMENT NOTICE&#13;
The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is expected to receive a credit from the&#13;
World Bank Trust Fund established for supporting the emergency reconstruction program for the&#13;

Reconstruction Project. The Government is also expected to receive loans and grants from other&#13;
multilateral sources, such as the European Union, and from several bilateral sources.&#13;
The loans and grants mentioned above are intended to be used for emergency recovery of&#13;
the education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is intended that the loans and grants would&#13;
finance the cost of the following procurement:&#13;
I.    Reconstruction of primary schools throughout the Federation including civil works&#13;
contracting, the preparation of architectural designs and specifications and the&#13;
supervision of works.&#13;
2.     Supply and/or printing of textbooks, supplementary readers and basic education&#13;
materials.&#13;
3.    Supply of office equipment, furniture, supplies and vehicles.&#13;
4.    Consultant services for pre-printing textbook activities, policy analysis, project&#13;
preparation and project implementation.&#13;
Given the emergency nature of the Project, the above mentioned goods and consultant&#13;
services will be procured through accelerated procurement procedures within the framework of&#13;
the procurement guidelines and regulations of the World Bank, European Union, and other&#13;
possible participating financing agencies and donors.&#13;
Interested suppliers and manufactures and consulting firms are invited to send their&#13;

            Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency
            Education Reconstruction Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Emergency
            Education Reconstruction Project is to support Bosnia and
            Herzegovina's efforts to restore the delivery of
            primary education of acceptable quality during the 1996-97
            school year. A second objective is to help build capacity
            for planning and implementation of education programs at the
            state, entity, canton, and municipality level. To achieve
            these objectives under the prevailing constraints, the
            project focuses on meeting immediate educational needs in
            primary schooling which can, for the most part, be put in
            place prior to the start of the next school year in
            September, 1996. The components of the project are the
            following: 1) primary school reconstruction; 2) books and
            educational materials; 3) project implementation and
            capacity building; and 4) project preparation and pilot
            implementation in the Republica Srpska. They include civil
            works, provision of furniture and equipment and technical
            assistance and training.
