yeais                   tariffs would harm      farmers and thus undermine the achievements of&#13;
the green revolution package-cheap             power and water, new       seeds and&#13;
fertilizer-aimed at enabling the country to feed itself. But a new&#13;
study shows that a package of rapid electricity sector reforms,&#13;
including a move toward cost-covering tariffs and investments to&#13;
improve the quality of power supply, would increase farmers' incomes&#13;
by 40-100 percent over a six-year period.&#13;

            Power subsidies - a reality check on
            subsidizing power for irrigation in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            After almost a decade of high-level
            efforts to bring electricity tariffs closer to the cost of
            supply, India has barely made a dent in the long-standing
            and increasingly uneconomical practice of subsidizing power
            for irrigation. Progress has been slowed by concern that
            higher tariffs would harm farmers and thus undermine the
            achievements of the green revolution package-cheap power and
            water, new seeds and fertilizer-aimed at enabling the
            country to feed itself. But a new study shows that a package
            of rapid electricity sector reforms, including a move toward
            cost-covering tariffs and investments to improve the quality
            of power supply, would increase farmers' incomes by
            40-100 percent over a six-year period.
