BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
I. TRANSPORT SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
A. The Transport Sector in the Economy&#13;
1.01   The transport sector accounts for a rather low R$13 billion or 4.3 percent of Brazil's GNP. Road&#13;
transport alone accounts for about 3.2 percent. But these figures exclude the very important segments&#13;
of own-account transport, services by truck owner-operators, and private automobile use, which are not&#13;
accounted for in GNP calculations. Total transportation expenditures amount to about US$90 billion&#13;
equivalent; road transport accounts for 85 percent, and rail transport for only about two percent of that&#13;
total (Table 1, Annex 13). The transport industry has grown at rates which systematically exceeded those&#13;
of GNP and other industries. In the 1970s, when GDP increased at an average 8.5 percent per year, the&#13;
transport industry grew at over 11 percent per year; in the 1980s and early 1990s, when GDP grew at&#13;
an average two percent per year, the transport industry grew at three percent per year on average&#13;
(Table 2, Annex 13).&#13;
1.02   Public investments in transport, which used to account for about 40 percent of total public capital&#13;
formation in the 1960s and the early 1970s and reached 3.3 percent of GNP in 1975, have drastically&#13;
decreased to below one percent of GNP since 1981. Road expenditures in particular had to be curtailed&#13;
severely, which resulted in the deterioration of large portions of the networks built in the 1950s and&#13;
1960s.  The unsatisfactory operational and financial performance of the railways also led to&#13;
underinvestment, insufficient maintenance, and to the deterioration of railway tracks, motive power and&#13;
rolling stock. Because of the size of the transport industry, its direct impact upon the productive sectors,&#13;
the extensive involvement of the government and the fiscal implications, the performance of the transport&#13;
sector is critical to the success of the Government's economic stabilization and growth efforts.&#13;
B. The Macroeconomic Policy Framework&#13;
1.03   The macroeconomic policy framework in Brazil remains within the parameters outlined in the&#13;
Base Case of the Country Assistance Strategy, which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors&#13;
on June 29, 1995. Core inflation remains below its targeted level with a rate of under one percent per&#13;
month, and actual inflation for 1995, at 15 percent, was the lowest in decades. The balance of payments&#13;
also remained strong, and gross international reserves have continued to accumulate, reaching $52 billion&#13;
by December 1995, or 11 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. This has occurred despite&#13;
a weakening of the current account deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP, higher than anticipated as a result of&#13;
more rapid growth in 1995 and an appreciation of the real exchange rate. These positive outcomes for&#13;
inflation and the balance of payments appear set to continue in the medium term (Annex 1).&#13;
1.04   Fiscal policy, however, weakened in 1995, with the operational balance of the public sector&#13;
declining from a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to a deficit of 5 percent in 1995. The primary&#13;
balance remained in surplus in 1995 (0.4 percent of GDP), but was significantly lower than in 1994 (4.3&#13;
percent of GDP). The most important factors behind this deterioration were an increase in wages and&#13;
a much higher domestic interest bill resulting from tight monetary policy and an accumulation of internal&#13;
debt by Federal and State governments. While the Government is committed to reducing fiscal deficits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
over the medium term, it has been hampered by structural rigidities in public sector accounts (revenue&#13;
earmarking, payroll and pension rigidities and interest consume almost all the budget). The structural&#13;
reforms required to improve the situation (privatization, pension, administrative and tax reforms) have&#13;
been progressing slowly through the political system, but should provide the basis for fiscal improvements&#13;
on both operational and primary balances in 1997 and 1998 (Annex 1). The sectoral adjustment&#13;
supported by the project would contribute positively to this medium-term fiscal improvement.&#13;
C. The Transport System&#13;
1.05   Institutions. Through a Constitutional mandate, the Federal Government is required to operate&#13;
interstate and international rail, water, air and passenger road transport, including port and airport&#13;
services, either directly or through concessions or other forms of authorization. The state expanded its&#13;
direct control over the sector in the 1950s-1970s. It took control of the many privately-owned railroads,&#13;
merging them into the federal railways (RFFSA) and the Sao Paulo state railway (FEPASA), and it has&#13;
retained majority shareholder control, through Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), of the two other,&#13;
primarily ore-carrier railways. The port facilities and operations, with some exceptions, have been&#13;
incorporated into the former Portobras system. The state, through the Portobras system, Petrobras for&#13;
oil-specialized operations and CVRD for minerals, and through concessions to private companies, has&#13;
been controlling the country's entire port system. In addition, the state owns and operates a substantial&#13;
portion of the merchant fleet (through Lloydbras, Petrobras and Docenave) and is present in inland&#13;
shipping. The Federation also received a mandate to regulate road freight transport through a law passed&#13;
in 1984, but this industry has never been regulated in practice and has generally remained efficient. By&#13;
contrast, the State's direct control over the railroads has led to their poor operational and financial&#13;
performance (section E) and to inadequate railway regulations (section F).&#13;
1.06   Networks. The South and Southeast regions of Brazil have a dense system of highways and&#13;
railways. Substantial portions of the highway networks have deteriorated as a result of very heavy traffic&#13;
and inadequate maintenance. Many highways require rehabilitation or strengthening, and some also need&#13;
to be widened. There is scope, however, for the railways to increase their participation in the transport&#13;
along the main north-south and export corridors, which could help postpone some highway capacity&#13;
investments. The Center-West frontier region, in which an unprecedented expansion of agriculture has&#13;
been taking place, has as yet very sparse highway and feeder road networks. The bulk of the region's&#13;
exports is transported by truck at a very high cost. Efficient inter-modal services based on the railways&#13;
which connect the southeastern part of the region to Sao Paulo-Santos and to Belo Horizonte-Vitoria and&#13;
the northern part of the region to Sao Luis, as well as on some of the rivers which flow from the region's&#13;
periphery, could reduce these costs. The Northeast region has a well developed highway network, with&#13;
substantially lower traffic levels, and an extensive railway system, mostly uneconomic, except for the&#13;
Carajas corridor. Coastal shipping has some importance in both intra- and inter-regional trades. The&#13;
North, with its sparse population and economic activity, has traditionally relied upon river transport for&#13;
both passenger and cargo movements in the Amazon basin. Air transport has an increasing role in&#13;
moving passengers and high-value goods over the long distances involved.&#13;
1.07   Operations. The unstable macroeconomic environment and the efforts made to control inflation&#13;
through reducing public expenditures and containing the rates of the public companies has led to the&#13;
postponement of needed maintenance activities and capacity investments; to the rapid deterioration of&#13;
important portions of the transport system, including trunk highways, railway tracks, motive power and&#13;
rolling stock, and port facilities; and to traffic congestion in important corridors. The cost of road&#13;
transport on deteriorated and/or congested highways increased despite technological advances in the truck&#13;
and bus manufacturing industries. In addition, Government regulation or direct intervention in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
management of public enterprises, through imposing uniform tariff policies and public service obligations,&#13;
has reduced their ability to adapt to market and technological changes, and led to the inefficient&#13;
operations, to poor service quality and to the chronic financial losses that characterize public companies.&#13;
This situation, together with the unattractive compensation packages offered in the public service, has led&#13;
to the present state of institutional degradation of the sector's public entities.&#13;
1.08   Investments.  Public investments in the transport sector, through the 1970s, went towards&#13;
expanding the transport system into the interior of the country to permit settlement and support new&#13;
economic activities, and towards increasing transport capacity on the eastern seaboard. The largest share&#13;
went to the construction of the primary highway network. After the first oil shock, federal priorities went&#13;
to the railway and port infrastructure of the main corridors, in support of the development of the steel&#13;
industry and of mineral and grain exports. In the early 1980s, public investments in the sector were&#13;
scaled down drastically; and priorities gradually shifted from new construction to maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation. However, the Government's austerity program and the containment of the tariffs of the&#13;
public entities led to the postponement of needed maintenance and rehabilitation works and to the&#13;
deterioration of large portions of essential transport infrastructure sector-wide. Investments in transport&#13;
should therefore, in the short term, be focused on the rehabilitation and maintenance of the facilities and&#13;
on selected improvements and capacity increases to the existing systems, which are essential to the&#13;
recovery of economic growth. They should primarily support the country's agricultural and industrial&#13;
growth, and export objectives, and contribute to improving the efficiency and performance of transport&#13;
operators.&#13;
D. Sector Policy and Institutional Reform&#13;
1.09   The management of the transport sector is undergoing significant changes. A number of reforms,&#13;
which aim at reducing government expenditures in the sector, at deregulating and privatizing transport&#13;
services so as to allow market forces to be the primary determinant of the services provided, and at&#13;
decentralizing expenditure and financing responsibilities to lower levels of government, have been&#13;
recently undertaken or are about to be implemented. The Concession Law, enacted in February 1995,&#13;
establishes the legal framework for private concessions of public services. A proposal for a new&#13;
Transport Law, which would redefine the entire transport system under federal jurisdiction, is currently&#13;
being considered by the Congress. The following paragraphs summarize the status of these reforms in&#13;
highways, railways, ports and multimodal transport.&#13;
1.10   Highways. The Constitutional reform of 1988 decentralized fiscal revenues, transferring road&#13;
user taxes to States and Municipalities, but kept unchanged the distribution of responsibilities among the&#13;
three administrative levels. The reform has affected the ability of the Federation to rehabilitate and&#13;
maintain an extensive federal highway network, and to finance needed capacity investments. The&#13;
Government has decided to reduce the size of the road network under federal jurisdiction to the interstate&#13;
highways and international connections, to transfer the operation and maintenance of high-traffic highways&#13;
as well as capacity investments to private concessionaires where feasible, and to transfer other highways&#13;
to state jurisdictions. A highway concession program has been developed and is being implemented, with&#13;
five concessions already awarded. Agreements have been reached with the state governments on the&#13;
highways to be transferred from federal to state jurisdictions and on the main conditions of the transfers.&#13;
1.11   Railways. The Government has decided to restructure the federal railways (RFFSA) and to&#13;
concession their operations. BNDES proposed and the Government approved a privatization model which&#13;
consists of restructuring RFFSA into six regional systems and concessioning the operation and&#13;
maintenance of the systems. Concessionaires would lease fixed assets from RFFSA, and would have the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
option of buying or leasing motive power and rolling stock. The Government's restructuring and&#13;
privatization plan for RFFSA is presented in Chapter II. The proposed project would assist the&#13;
Government in implementing the plan (Chapter III). Similarly, the Government of the State of Sao Paulo&#13;
decided to restructure and to privatize FEPASA, following a similar model. The federal and the state&#13;
governments are presently discussing FEPASA's transfer to federal jurisdiction. Finally, the Federal&#13;
Government decided to privatize CVRD, including the EFVM and EFC railways. The proposed project&#13;
would help implement the necessary measures to ensure adequate integration of the rail operations and&#13;
permit efficient inter-railroad and intermodal services (para 3.05).&#13;
1.12   Ports. The Government closed the National Port Holding Company "Portobras" in 1990 and the&#13;
Congress approved a law for a broad deregulation of the port system in February 1993. The Port Law&#13;
liberalizes port activities, enabling private terminals to operate for public use. It also decentralizes&#13;
normative and tariff setting responsibilities to newly-created local Port Authority Councils, and authorizes&#13;
private port operators to compete with the port administrations. The Government has recently developed&#13;
policies and guidelines to assist with the full implementation of the reform, including the privatization&#13;
of the ports and terminals, and a new organizational scheme for the labor force; and some ports,&#13;
including Santos, have made progress in implementing the reform.&#13;
1.13   Multimnodal Transport. The rapid evolution and expansion of intra- and inter-regional trade,&#13;
fostered by regional trade bloc initiatives and by agricultural expansion and industrial development in the&#13;
interior of Brazil, will require important changes in the national and international transport systems.&#13;
Freight carriers will be required to provide efficient and comprehensive logistic services to agricultural,&#13;
industrial and commercial shippers, and for this purpose they will have to seek innovative multimodal&#13;
transport solutions which maximize productivity and quality of service. This in turn will require a much&#13;
better integration of the transport systems, particularly railroads and ports, which represent the major&#13;
bottlenecks in the present transport system. The restructuring and privatization of railroads and port&#13;
terminals, if adequately carried out, is expected to resolve the bulk of the intra- and intermodal&#13;
bottlenecks. Progress has already been made since 1991 in removing entry restrictions in the ocean and&#13;
coastal shipping and multimodal transport industries, as well as in removing restrictions on inland&#13;
circulation of containers.  New legislation currently before the Congress would establish flexible&#13;
regulation for multimodal transport, and remove restrictions on the inland use of international containers,&#13;
and therefore would, if approved, further facilitate multimodal transport.&#13;
E. The Railway Industry: Economic Role and Perfonnance&#13;
1.14   Brazil's railway industry consists of four principal carriers: Rede Ferroviaria Federal S.A.&#13;
(RFFSA), which is owned by the Federal Government; Ferrovia Paulista S.A. (FEPASA), which is&#13;
owned by the State of Sao Paulo; Estrada de Ferro Vitoria a Minas (EFVM) and Estrada de Ferro Carajas&#13;
(EFC), which are primarily ore-carrier railways owned by CVRD. With 30,000 km of track, and a&#13;
freight traffic of approximately 120 billion ton-kilometers, Brazil's railway industry is the largest in Latin&#13;
America and can be compared to those in Mexico and Canada (Table 3, Annex 13). RFFSA is the main&#13;
operating entity, accounting for about two-thirds of total track length, rolling stock and employees.&#13;
RFFSA's traffic is reasonably well diversified, its iron ore traffic accounting for only 40%, while EFVM&#13;
and EFC are highly specialized ore carriers. For this reason, RFFSA carries only about one third of total&#13;
railway traffic measured in ton-kilometers (Table 3, Annex 13).&#13;
1.15   The role of the railway industry has declined with the development of the highway networks and&#13;
the trucking and bus industries over the past three decades. In particular, inter-city passenger services&#13;
have been almost entirely closed. The railway industry, however, continues to have an important role&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in the transport of freight, since it accounts for about 25 % of total freight movements measured in ton-&#13;
kilometers. The railways have an advantage in handling long-haul bulk commodities such as mineral&#13;
ores. They also have an advantage over trucking on long-haul flows of petroleum products, but they are&#13;
losing some traffic to newly-built pipelines. They have been competing with some success in handling&#13;
large volumes of grains and grain products to consumption, processing or export centers on the eastern&#13;
seaboard; with improved performance, they could substantially increase their share of such traffic. They&#13;
lost most of the general cargo traffic to trucking in the past, but efficient railways and intermodal carriers&#13;
could re-capture a significant share of this important and potentially profitable traffic, as appears to be&#13;
happening in Argentina.&#13;
1.16   Both RFFSA and FEPASA have relatively low average traffic densities (1.8 and 1.5 million net&#13;
tons per year, respectively), which vary widely across the systems. For example, RFFSA's traffic&#13;
density ranges from over 11 million net-tons on its Southeastern lines which carry iron ore, to about&#13;
200,000 net-tons per year on the Northeast network, and seven out of the current twelve operating&#13;
regions have traffic densities below I million net-tons per year (Table 3, Annex 13). Thus a substantial&#13;
portion of the network is well below the level of minimum efficient density, and fails to earn revenues&#13;
in excess of variable costs. Because of Government intervention in response to local interests, the&#13;
railways have been unable to abandon low-density branch lines, which, together with the lack of agressive&#13;
marketing on the part of the public railways, explain such low track productivity. Labor productivity has&#13;
substantially increased with the important reductions of staff, although it still remains far below&#13;
comparable railways in Northern America (less than I million net ton-km per employee in RFFSA and&#13;
about half a million in FEPASA, as compared to over 5 million net ton-km per employee in Canada and&#13;
the US (Table 3, Annex 13). Motive power and wagon productivities are also low by international&#13;
standards, thereby adversely affecting the railways financial performance. RFFSA, except for 1992,&#13;
consistently incurred substantial operating losses ranging from US$390 million equivalent in 1988 to&#13;
US$159 million equivalent in 1994 (Table 6, Annex 13). These losses have contributed to the insufficient&#13;
investments, inadequate maintenance and to the deteriorating service which characterize the two general&#13;
carrier railways. A detailed analysis of Brazil's railway subsector is presented in Bank report No. 11752-&#13;
BR entitled "The Brazilian Railroad Industry: Options for Organizational Restructuring", and dated&#13;
February 15, 1994.&#13;
F. Railway Regulation&#13;
1.17   Although intermodal competition has been a factor in the decline of Brazil's railways, many&#13;
performance problems seem to have their origin, like in many other countries, in excessive government&#13;
regulatory control and intervention in the railways' operations, investments and finances. Until 1989,&#13;
the Government strictly controlled the level and structure of railway tariffs, and even after tariffs were&#13;
freed from the Government's direct control, railway tariff increases, as other prices, remained&#13;
subordinated to macroeconomic considerations through various stabilization plans, including the current&#13;
Plano Real. In addition to the impact on average tariff levels, regulatory controls also caused significant&#13;
distortions. In particular, the value of service rate structure encouraged high-value cargoes to shift to&#13;
trucks. Besides price controls, the Government has also imposed public service obligations to the&#13;
railways, such as the operation of non-remunerative inter-city passenger and commuter services, and the&#13;
operation of uneconomic branch lines. Government justification for such intervention has generally been&#13;
social and regional development objectives, but short term political benefits have also been a factor.&#13;
Efforts made by the railways to obtain Government compensation for such public service obligations&#13;
generally were not successful. Inter-city passenger services were gradually closed, and commuter train&#13;
operations were separated from the freight railways and are now being transferred to state and local&#13;
governments. But there is still a need to rationalize the networks through abandonment of uneconomic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
branch lines, in particular in the Northeast. Government interference in the railways' investments,&#13;
imposing programs or projects which do not reflect the railways' true development priorities or their&#13;
financial capacities, has further affected the railways' operational and financial performance.&#13;
1.18   In order to reduce such intervention in railways' operations and investments, and to improve their&#13;
performance, the Government recently redesigned the railway regulatory framework. The new regulation&#13;
would in particular: (a) permit operators to freely set their prices for services which face effective&#13;
competition; (b) permit operators to set prices that are responsive to differences in demands and in&#13;
marginal costs, and to enter into voluntary contracts with shippers that have individualized terms and&#13;
conditions; and (c) constrain the prices which a railway sets for captive shippers over whom the railway&#13;
has monopoly power, by the stand-alone costs of the shipper's services (Annex 7). The Government&#13;
would strengthen MT's Department of Rail Transport (DTF) to implement the new regulation, and would&#13;
establish a Rail Transport Commission for dispute resolution. The proposed project would assist the&#13;
Government in implementing the regulatory reform (paras. 3.12 and 3.13).&#13;
G. Bank Sector Experience and Strategy&#13;
1.19   The Bank has made 30 loans in the transport sector since the early 1960s: 15 for highways and&#13;
feeder roads, five for railways, two for ports, and eight for urban transportation, in addition to financing&#13;
rural roads under a number of agriculture projects and the construction of the Carajas railway under the&#13;
Carajas Iron Ore project (Loan No. 2196-BR). Until the mid 1970s, the projects concentrated on the&#13;
expansion of the trunk highway network and on the improvement of the railway and mass transit systems.&#13;
The first port project, completed in 1981, helped finance the construction of a container terminal in&#13;
Santos. In subsequent years, emphasis gradually shifted to the maintenance and rehabilitation of the&#13;
interstate and trunk highway network, to the planning and implementation on a decentralized basis of&#13;
feeder roads programs, to the rehabilitation of important railway corridors, and to the improvement of&#13;
public bus transport and traffic management in the major cities. More recently, the Bank has been&#13;
supporting the rehabilitation and decentralization of CBTU's urban train systems with four loans, and&#13;
highway rehabilitation, maintenance and decentralization with one loan to the Federation and five loans&#13;
to states.&#13;
1.20   The Bank's involvement in the transport sector has been successful. The projects' physical&#13;
objectives have generally been met although the more recent difficult economic conditions and related&#13;
funding problems have sometimes caused delays. Progress has been made on policy reforms and&#13;
institutional strengthening (section D) though it has taken more time than expected, due to the size and&#13;
complexity of the sector, the large number of government agencies and public enterprises involved, and&#13;
the difficulty of reaching the needed consensus for policy reforms. Under the two recently completed&#13;
railway projects, progress was made towards the commercially oriented operation of both RFFSA and&#13;
FEPASA, in particular with the separation of commuter train operations, the closure of uneconomic inter-&#13;
city passenger services, the railways' freedom to set rates, and with staff reductions. However, the&#13;
Government's direct and indirect intervention in the management of the public railways has continued to&#13;
adversely affect their operational efficiency and financial performance (Annex 2).&#13;
1.21   The assistance of the Bank to the transport sector of Brazil will remain oriented by broader&#13;
country objectives, particularly: (a) the stabilization process, and the consequent need to contain public&#13;
expenditures, increase revenue mobilization and improve resource utilization in the sector; (b) the&#13;
resumption of economic growth, ensuring efficient and reliable infrastructure services to targeted growth&#13;
sectors of the economy; (c) the redefinition of the role of the state, strengthening its regulatory functions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
withdrawing from operational roles and promoting private sector operations and investment in&#13;
infrastructure; (d) the administrative decentralization; and (e) the environmental management dimension.&#13;
1.22   Emphasis will be upon the formulation and effective implementation of appropriate transport&#13;
policies including: (a) pricing policies, through continued liberalization of price controls, restoration of&#13;
adequate pricing policies and mechanisms in the public sector, and efficient user taxation; (b) re-design&#13;
of sector regulations, establishment of appropriate regulatory agencies, and effective implementation of&#13;
regulatory reform, which, together with efficient pricing mechanisms and privatization measures, aim at&#13;
restoring the role of market forces in the sector; (c) institutional reform, including effective&#13;
decentralization of government responsibilities, seeking an appropriate balance between fiscal revenues&#13;
and responsibilities, strengthening the normative and monitoring functions as well as technological and&#13;
human resource development at the center, and the planning, management and environmental control&#13;
capabilities of the decentralized entities; (d) privatization of operation and maintenance services through&#13;
concessions and management contracts; and (e) public investment programming and private sector&#13;
investment promotion based on appropriate economic, environmental and project finance analyses, aiming&#13;
in particular at facilitating intra- and inter-regional trade flows.&#13;
II. THE FEDERAL RAILWAYS (RFFSA)&#13;
A. Historical Summary&#13;
2.01   RFFSA was created in 1957 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport (MT) by merging&#13;
18 independent railways built mostly by British and French concessionaires beginning in the 19th century.&#13;
The reason for unification and nationalization was to promote efficiency. In fact, Latin American&#13;
countries experienced a wave of nationalizations during the post World War II period, of which the&#13;
railways were a notable example. RFFSA had its origins in this movement.&#13;
2.02   Since nationalization, RFFSA's traffic has experienced relatively steady growth in line with the&#13;
rest of the Brazilian economy (Table 4, Annex 13). Unfortunately, the steady growth of traffic was not&#13;
accompanied by financial health or stable operations. Instead, a lack of business orientation at RFFSA&#13;
combined with constant Government intervention in RFFSA decision-making and politically imposed&#13;
redundant labor led to years of insufficient earnings. Government did not adequately compensate for the&#13;
lack of earnings, and RFFSA had to live through years of inadequate capital investment.&#13;
2.03   Government attempts at railway reform, which were supported by Bank lending, included labor&#13;
reduction programs, reductions in intercity passenger services and, perhaps most important, transfer of&#13;
suburban passenger operations and deficits into a separate organization (CBTU). There has been a&#13;
gradual shrinkage of the railway labor force and, with growing traffic, a consequent improvement in labor&#13;
productivity (Table 4, Annex 13). In spite of these reforms and improvements, however, RFFSA has&#13;
consistently been in deficit, especially if full costs are taken into account (Table 4, Annex 13).&#13;
2.04   The Government, realizing that attempts to reform RFFSA under the public umbrella have failed,&#13;
and after analyzing the experience of other Latin American countries, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,&#13;
Guatemala, and now Mexico, has decided to restructure and to concession the operation and maintenance&#13;
of its railways to the private sector, and to redesign railway regulation in order to permit effective&#13;
competition with the trucking industry. It will be the first large-scale privatization of public infrastructure&#13;
services in Brazil. However, the Government has already successfully privatized important customers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
of the railways, such as the steel industry, and is preparing to concession other transport services such&#13;
as ports and highways, as well as other sectors such as water and power. It is anticipated that most&#13;
shippers as well as transport operators will be privately organized, much less regulated, and much more&#13;
competitive; hence the prospects are good for a significant improvement of the performance of the&#13;
transport industry as a whole.&#13;
B. Operations and Marketing&#13;
2.05   RFFSA is organized into 12 essentially non-competing geographic "Regional Superintendencies&#13;
(SRs)" (IBRD Map No. 27392). RFFSA actually owns two rail networks, one meter gauge and the other&#13;
"broad gauge" (1.60 meter). The map also displays the other railways in Brazil, of which the most&#13;
important are FEPASA in Sao Paulo State, which has both meter and broad gauge trackage, and the two&#13;
CVRD railways, of which the Carajas railway in the Northeast is standard gauge and the EFVM railway&#13;
from Belo Horizonte to Vitoria is meter gauge. The combination of historical fragmentation among&#13;
railways and RFFSA's regions, gauge differences and Brazilian geography has effectively negated the&#13;
possibility of integrating Brazil's railways into one "system". Very little traffic is actually interchanged&#13;
among RFFSA's Regions and in the six proposed concessions, only two (Centro-Leste and Nordeste) are&#13;
physically contiguous and have the same gauge. RFFSA currently has relatively small interchange traffic&#13;
with FEPASA and EFVM railways, but the potential to increase such traffic is substantial. RFFSA has&#13;
already established trackage rights with the other railways, and will establish further trackage rights as&#13;
appropriate between the proposed concessions and the other railways (para. 3.05).&#13;
2.06   Substantial cross-regional differences in RFFSA's revenues and volumes of traffic exist which&#13;
have profound implications for the feasibility of the various options to geographically restructure the&#13;
system. The Southeast area, encompassing the economic triangle of Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro and&#13;
Sao Paulo, generates almost three-quarters of the railway's tonnage. RFFSA's operation in the Southeast&#13;
is also its most productive, accounting for only 31 % of its trackage and 49% of its staff but generating&#13;
66% of its revenue. Three Superintendencies (SR3, SR2, and SR5) account for 80% of RFFSA's freight&#13;
tonnage and over 75% of its revenue. The next three most important regions (SR6, SR10, and SR7)&#13;
generate 14%  of the railroad's traffic and 14%  of its revenue.  Finally, the remaining six&#13;
Superintendencies (SR4, SR8, SR9, SR1, SR11, and SR12) account for less than 6% of the company's&#13;
freight tonnage and 11 % of its revenue.&#13;
2.07   RFFSA's activities are organized along four business lines, each consisting of industry-related&#13;
commodities: iron ore and steel, fuels, agriculture products, and construction materials. RFFSA's&#13;
business is distributed among these groups as follows: (a) iron ore and steel products, about 57% of&#13;
freight tonnage and 48% of revenues; (b) fuels, including petroleum products and alcohol, about 16%&#13;
of tonnage and 30% of revenues; (c) agriculture, including grain and grain products, about 18% of&#13;
tonnage and 14% of revenues; and (d) construction materials, about 9% of tonnage and 8% of revenues.&#13;
It is important to note that the average length of haul, approximately 450 km, is very short by North&#13;
American standards, confirming that the railway is very vulnerable to truck competition except for the&#13;
major movements of bulk commodities which are characterized by significant economies of scale.&#13;
2.08   RFFSA is burdened by excess capacity and uneconomic lines, in particular in the Northeast&#13;
region. It has a relatively low average traffic density (1.7 million net-tons per year) despite the fact that&#13;
it carries heavy freight traffic. This compares with over five million net-tons in the United States and&#13;
in Canada (Table 3, Annex 13). But freight traffic density varies dramatically across the Regional&#13;
Superintendencies, from 11 and 5 million net-tons in SR3 and SR4, to about 200,000 net-tons per year&#13;
in SRI and SR12. The system-wide average traffic density statistics, therefore, mask the severity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
RFFSA's track productivity problem. Indeed, seven out of the 12 regions have traffic densities well&#13;
below 1 million net-tons, indicating that economies of scale of track are not being realized. Thus, a&#13;
substantial portion of RFFSA's trackage is well below the level of minimum efficient density and fails&#13;
to earn revenues in excess of variable cost, at current rail rates. However, because of Government&#13;
regulation and intervention, RFFSA has made only a modest progress in rationalizing its operations.&#13;
Between 1975 and 1995, its trackage was reduced by only 10% indicating only little abandonment of low-&#13;
density branchlines. In order to enable the concessionaires to effectively rationalize the networks, the&#13;
Government has: (a) presented to the Congress a proposal for a new Transport Law (Sistema Nacional&#13;
de Viacao, SNV), which, inter-alia, substantially reduces the railway network of national interest under&#13;
federal jurisdiction; and (b) re-designed the railway regulation to enable operators to abandon branch lines&#13;
which are not part of the new SNV, and to close operations on those branch lines under the SNV which&#13;
are shown to be uneconomic (Annex 7). The project would help to effectively implement the redesigned&#13;
regulation (paras. 3.12 and 3.13).&#13;
C. Operations Restructuring and Concessioning Plan&#13;
2.09   The Government, through BNDES, studied a number of alternatives to the current structure of&#13;
RFFSA, which would introduce incentives for the rail sector to minimize production costs and provide&#13;
profitable services, including: (a) vertical separation, with governmental ownership of way and structure&#13;
and privately organized and operated transportation services; (b) allowing private entrepreneurs to provide&#13;
their own services over the rail network, perhaps in competition with some of the services provided by&#13;
the integrated railroad itself; and (c) the lease or sale of the integrated railroad under a competitive&#13;
bidding process. Each of the above options has its own advantages and drawbacks. In view of the&#13;
geographic characteristics of Brazil and the size of the federal railways, as well as of the significant cross-&#13;
regional differences in RFFSA's traffic, the Government decided that RFFSA would be horizontally&#13;
restructured into a number of vertically integrated regional systems, and that concessions for the operation&#13;
and maintenance of these systems for 30 years would be auctioned to private operators, who would lease&#13;
the railway's assets. A minimum price is set for each concession. The price at which each concession&#13;
is bought is to be paid in part as a downpayment, shortly after the auction, and in part as a series of&#13;
quarterly lease payments to RFFSA. The proceeds from each downpayment would be divided, in&#13;
proportions to be determined in each concession, between the National Treasury and RFFSA. The&#13;
Government would, in each case, specify the application of RFFSA's revenues to reduce its debts.&#13;
2.10   The restructuring plan, which was prepared by BNDES and approved by the Government, is to&#13;
divide the RFFSA system into six regional concessions (IBRD Map No. 27392). The proposed&#13;
concessions are currently independent systems serving different markets, with no or limited inter-&#13;
connections and interchange traffic. Two of the proposed concessions are dominated by a limited number&#13;
of commodities: Sudeste (former SR3 and SR4) is a broad gauge iron ore and steel product carrier which&#13;
carries 52 percent of RFFSA's total ton-km on eight percent of its track; Tubarao (former SR9) is a small&#13;
carrier of coal from mine to power plant. Traffic for these two carriers has been and will be highly&#13;
dependent on a limited number of customers and markets. One potential concession, Nordeste (former&#13;
SRI, SRI 1 and SR12), is a light density "branch line" mixed commodity carrier operating in the poorest&#13;
Northeast region of Brazil. At least in the near future, Nordeste's traffic potential will be limited and&#13;
highly competitive with other modes. Nordeste is not, and probably cannot in the short term be&#13;
financially self-sustaining. The other three potential concessions have separate outlooks: Sul (former SR5&#13;
and SR6) carries a broad mix of commodities, all of which are either truck or pipeline competitive. Sul&#13;
is located in the most rapidly growing region of Brazil and is well-positioned to take advantage of any&#13;
traffic growth resulting from regional integration. Oeste (former SR10) connects the agricultural region&#13;
of Southern Brazil and Bolivia to the Atlantic ports via FEPASA. Oeste will prosper if Brazilian soya&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
exports continue to grow and so long as pipeline competition is limited. Centro-Leste (forner SR2, SR7&#13;
and SR8) has a broad traffic mix based on its linkages between Rio, Sao Paulo and the Center-West&#13;
region of Brazil, including Brasilia, and a good potential in the transport of grain and grain products from&#13;
the Center-West to the consumption and export centers on the eastern seaboard. Centro-Leste, however,&#13;
is vulnerable both to truck competition and to a petroleum pipeline already under construction.&#13;
2.11   The market and financial analyses of each of the proposed concessions carried out by RFFSA and&#13;
BNDES suggest that all concessions could be profitable, with the possible exception of the Nordeste,&#13;
which needs further studies (Annexes 3 and 9). The basic indicators and current productivity ratios for&#13;
the proposed concessions are compared with those of other railways in Table 3, Annex 13. The&#13;
Argentine and Chilean concessions, which are already in operation, with appropriate caution because of&#13;
insufficient operating history, appear to be operating reasonably well. They provide benchmarks against&#13;
which to compare Brazil's concession prospects. Judging by traffic density (ton-km/km of line), all of&#13;
the proposed concessions (except Nordeste) are significantly better than any of the Argentine or Chilean&#13;
concessions. This is an important measure because low traffic density suggests that the underlying traffic&#13;
potential is questionable or that the size of the network is too large. With the proposed staff retrenchment&#13;
and emergency rehabilitation and maintenance programs, the performance of the proposed concessions&#13;
can be brought into line with or better than that of Chile and Argentina concessions (Annex 9). There&#13;
is every reason to believe that the proposed concessions can be solid financial propositions.&#13;
2.12   The implementation plan and timetable for the proposed operations restructuring and&#13;
concessioning plan is presented in Annex 11. The restructuring of the Oeste system has been completed&#13;
and the concession was successfully auctioned on March 5, 1996 to a consortium of investors and banks&#13;
from the United States. The restructuring and concessioning of the other systems is scheduled over 1996&#13;
and 1997 (Annex 11, Chart 1).&#13;
D. Staff Productivity and Redundancy&#13;
2.13   Although RFFSA has already made significant progress in dealing with the labor redundancy, its&#13;
labor productivity continues to be low. RFFSA reduced its total staff from about 110,000 in 1975 to&#13;
about 42,000 in May 1995. This reduction led to a substantial increase in labor productivity from&#13;
250,000 to almost 1 million net ton-km per employee. Still, RFFSA's labor productivity remains low&#13;
not only by North American standards (above 5 million ton-km per employee) but also when compared&#13;
to the recently restructured and concessioned railways in Argentina and Chile, which already have&#13;
productivity ratios above 1.5 million net ton-km per employee (Table 3, Annex 13). The labor&#13;
productivity ratios in the various regional systems show the seriousness of the labor redundancy problem&#13;
even better. The proposed Sudeste concession, with essentially iron ore and other large bulk shipment&#13;
traffic, has a productivity ratio of about 2 million net ton-km per employee, while the EFVM and EFC&#13;
railways respectively achieve 10 and 20 million ton-km per employee. The Sul, Centro-Leste, and Oeste&#13;
systems, which have ratios ranging from 700 to 800,000 net ton-km per employee, would need to reduce&#13;
their staff by almost half in order to reach productivity levels which are comparable to the Argentina and&#13;
Chile concessions. The Nordeste and Tubarao systems have productivity ratios between 200 and 300,000&#13;
net ton-km per employee.&#13;
2.14  In order to enable the implementation of the proposed concessionning plan, the Government has&#13;
decided to reduce RFFSA staff as necessary to turn the proposed concessions viable.  RFFSA&#13;
management has developed staffing plans for the six concessions, based on re-defined operational&#13;
procedures and consolidated responsibilities, and identified the number of redundant staff by job&#13;
categories. The total number of redundant staff was estimated at about 18,000 on the basis of RFFSA's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
May 1995 staff of 41,991, excluding 4,000 staff that retired with early retirement benefits in early 1995.&#13;
The number of redundant staff by regional system is shown in Table 2, Annex 4. RFFSA designed and&#13;
prepared a staff retrenchment program on the basis of an analysis of redundant staff profiles against labor&#13;
market characteristics in the various regions, and optimized the various parameters through an econonic&#13;
analysis (Annex 4). The program, in addition to legally-required severance payments, which, as an&#13;
average, correspond to 10 months of salary, would include incentives for early retirement and voluntary&#13;
separation, involuntary separation grants for remaining redundant staff, re-training programs based on&#13;
regional employment opportunities, and job searching and outplacement assistance.&#13;
2.15   The program would be implemented in two phases at headquarters and in each region. In the first&#13;
phase, prior to concessioning, RFFSA would first implement the incentive schemes for early retirement&#13;
and voluntary separation, which would be offered only to certain categories of redundant staff and within&#13;
pre-determined limits. Depending on the results of the voluntary schemes, RFFSA would then lay off&#13;
redundant staff selectively, taking into account employee performance, and pay an involuntary separation&#13;
grant equivalent to 80% of the incentive. In the second phase, after concessioning, RFFSA would pay&#13;
an involuntary separation grant of the same amount as in the first phase to remaining redundant staff who&#13;
would not be hired by the concessionaire, up to a maximum number of staff specified in the concession&#13;
bidding documents. Compensation packages for additional layoffs beyond the specified number would&#13;
be the concessionaire's responsibility.&#13;
2.16   RFFSA has already reduced its staff by over 4,000 during 1995, mainly through early retirement&#13;
incentives, at a total cost of about US$40 million. RFFSA also completed the first phase of the&#13;
retrenchment program at headquarters (January 1996) and in the Oeste system (February 1996), reducing&#13;
staff by about 500 and 400 respectively. However, neither RFFSA nor the Government have the&#13;
resources necessary to fully implement the program. Further implementation of the program depends on&#13;
the availability of appropriate financing. The project would support the full implementation of the&#13;
program by providing financing for severance pay, re-training and outplacement assistance (paras. 3.07&#13;
to 3.09, and Annex 4).&#13;
E. Investment and Maintenance&#13;
2.17   RFFSA's total investment in the railway system declined every year since 1988, from US$267&#13;
million equivalent in 1988 to US$57 million in 1994, as a result of the railway's deteriorating financial&#13;
situation (Table 5, Annex 13). Until the late 1980s, the railway invested in the broad gauge system,&#13;
completing the Steel Railway, improving the Center line, and in rehabilitating locomotives, mostly with&#13;
financing from the shippers. From 1990, the only significant investments made by RFFSA were the track&#13;
rehabilitation and systems improvements in the Parana and Goias-Minas Gerais corridors, which were&#13;
financed by the Bank under the Federal Railway - Export Corridor Project (Loan No. 2563-BR).&#13;
Maintenance expenditures have also been drastically curtailed (Table 5, Annex 13).&#13;
2.18   As a result of insufficient investment and maintenance, locomotive availability, which is the&#13;
critical determinant of production capability, fell below 60 percent for the first time in 1994. RFFSA's&#13;
locomotive availability has continued to fall since 1994 and is now about 50 percent. This is comparable&#13;
to the situation in Argentina just before concessioning and is at the level of some of the worst of the&#13;
railways in the world. RFFSA is now actually refusing traffic, especially on the SR3 and SR4 systems,&#13;
due to insufficient available locomotives. The situation is especially critical on the Sudeste concession&#13;
where the output of the iron mines depends on RFFSA for shipment to port terminals or to steel mills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.19   Another consequence of RFFSA's lack of capital is the bad condition of the track. While it is&#13;
somewhat harder to measure track and fixed facility degradation than locomotives, available information&#13;
show that about one-third of RFFSA's network is in substandard condition owing to deferred track&#13;
maintenance. RFFSA suffered over 200 accidents in the first eight months of 1995, which were&#13;
attributable to bad track condition. The deterioration of the roadbed has led to reduced speeds, an&#13;
increased number of accidents, and a deterioration of service, which leads to diversion of traffic to&#13;
competing transport modes, causing a reduction in rail revenues, and further deferred maintenance and&#13;
concomitant deterioration in service. Also, because of shortage of capital, RFFSA was unable to make&#13;
investments which would have had very high rates of return. The most critical of these track problems&#13;
will need to be resolved before a concessionaire would be willing to take over operations on the lines.&#13;
2.20   Since neither RFFSA nor the Government have the resources to fund the necessary locomotive&#13;
and track repair and deferred maintenance programs which are necessary to allow for continued and safe&#13;
operation during the restructuring and concessioning process, and to enable the new concessionaires to&#13;
assume the systems in operating conditions, the project would include an emergency rehabilitation&#13;
program, and financing would be provided under the proposed loan for this purpose (para. 3.10). The&#13;
emergency rehabilitation program and its justification are presented in Annex 5.&#13;
F. Finances&#13;
2.21   During most of its history, RFFSA has generated losses on its operations. These persistent&#13;
operating losses reflect the pervasive organizational inefficiencies and low productivity, lack of&#13;
conimercial freedom, lack of market-oriented management structures, failure to significantly rationalize&#13;
operations by exiting from uneconomic low-density lines and shedding excess labor, and continuing&#13;
government-imposed obligations that rendered the railroad uncompetitive in the face of the growing&#13;
sophistication of road transport. Between 1988 and 1991, RFFSA incurred an average yearly operating&#13;
loss of US$378 million, after having received governmental contributions amounting to US$328 million&#13;
during the same period (Table 6, Annex 13). RFFSA has only rarely covered its operating costs from&#13;
revenues, even if "normalization" payments (i.e. Government payments to cover losses on public service&#13;
obligations) are included in total revenues. Over the last seven years, only in 1992 did RFFSA's gross&#13;
revenues cover its operating costs. In 1994, one of the best years in RFFSA's traffic history, transport&#13;
revenues barely covered labor and fuel costs.&#13;
2.22   RFFSA's financial performance shows substantial cross-regional variation, which can be largely&#13;
explained by the regional differences in the volume of traffic and track productivity. By most estimates,&#13;
SR3 is the system's only profitable region. In SR2 and SR5, the railroad is breaking approximately even,&#13;
while in the remaining regions it experiences operating deficits. SRI has the largest shortfall between&#13;
operating revenues and expenditures, followed by SR7 and SR8. The proposed operational restructuring,&#13;
staff retrenchment, and emergency rehabilitation programs have been designed to make the proposed&#13;
concessions financially viable (Annex 9).&#13;
2.23   Since RFFSA has not generated sufficient revenues to meet its payment obligations, RFFSA has&#13;
been accumulating payment arrears which have been growing rapidly. RFFSA's debt, which amounted&#13;
to almost US$3.0 billion by the end of December 1995, consists essentially of rapidly increasing short&#13;
term liabilities to Government entities such as the social security administration (US$1.9 billion including&#13;
interest and monetary correction), financial institutions (US$400 million), contractors (US$200 million),&#13;
and to the staff pension fund (US$300 million). Long-term debts are only about US$200 million. A&#13;
number of legal actions by creditors or labor are still pending, which could result in further liabilities.&#13;
RFFSA's assets total about US$16 billion equivalent in accounting terms. RFFSA's non-operational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
assets are estimated at about US$1.0 billion in market value, but most cannot be sold in the short term&#13;
due to past judicial decisions on legal actions by creditors.&#13;
2.24   RFFSA's revenues from the leasing of operational assets and from any sale or lease of non-rail&#13;
assets are expected to be used to repay as much as possible RFFSA's debts, and as a guarantee against&#13;
possible new labor and environmental liabilities. However, no decision has yet been made by the&#13;
Government regarding the treatment of RFFSA's debts, or the financing of the residual public service&#13;
obligations in the Northeast, which could be funded either from RFFSA's revenues, by the National&#13;
Treasury (against revenues from the sale of the railway concessions), and/or by state and local&#13;
governments. The Government is preparing to develop a plan, based on the results of the first auctions,&#13;
for the settlement of RFFSA's debts and labor and environmental liabilities, and for financing residual&#13;
public service obligations in the Northeast (para. 3.14).&#13;
111. TIHE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin, Objectives and Rationale&#13;
3.01   Project Origin.  The Government decided in 1992 to restructure and privatize RFFSA's&#13;
operations in order to stop the deteriorating trend in RFFSA's performance and to improve the efficiency&#13;
of rail transport. BNDES prepared and the National Destatization Council (CND) recently approved the&#13;
restructuring and privatization plan. The plan basically consists of restructuring RFFSA's operations into&#13;
six regional systems and of transferring operation and maintenance responsibilities to private&#13;
concessionaires who would lease the necessary assets from RFFSA. The Bank has assisted through policy&#13;
dialogue and the preparation of a comprehensive analysis of Brazil's railway industry and of alternative&#13;
public policy options (Report No.  1752-BR, The Brazilian Railroad Industry: Options for Organizational&#13;
Restructuring. February 15, 1994). The proposed proiect was designed to assist the Government and&#13;
RFFSA in effectively implementing the plan.&#13;
3.02   Project Objectives. The project aims to reduce the cost of freight transport in Brazil's main&#13;
corridors by restructuring and privatizing the federal railways. Specific objectives would be to:&#13;
(a) improve performance by restructuring and concessioning RFFSA's operations to private&#13;
operators, and by restructuring its finances to settle debts and labor liabilities;&#13;
(b) increase productivity through staff retrenchment and emergency rehabilitation of critical assets&#13;
in order to make the proposed concessions viable, while minimizing the social cost of staff&#13;
retrenchment;&#13;
(c) enhance competition through regulatory reform, with a view to increase the railways' market&#13;
share and reduce freight transport rates.&#13;
Achievement of these objectives would be measured and monitored during implementation through a set&#13;
of key indicators (para. 4.12 and Annex 11, Table 2).&#13;
3.03   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's country assistance strategy for Brazil, discussed&#13;
by the Board of Executive Directors on June 29, 1995, identifies human capital formation and&#13;
infrastructure development as the principal bottlenecks to Brazil's social and economic development. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
emphasis is on structural reforms aimed at stabilization and resumption of broad-based growth, including&#13;
the deregulation and privatization of infrastructure services, and on rebuilding and expanding a&#13;
deteriorated and insufficient infrastructure in partnership with the private sector. The proposed project&#13;
is fully supportive of this assistance strategy. By helping to deregulate and privatize the federal railway&#13;
operations, the project, in addition to reducing the financial burden on public sector finances, would&#13;
substantially increase the efficiency of rail and intermodal transport in the country's important corridors,&#13;
and thereby contribute to economic stabilization, resumption of growth in agriculture and industry, and&#13;
increased export competitiveness.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.04   The project, a specific investment operation, would consist of the following six components:&#13;
(a) Operations Restructuring and Concessioning Component (ORC) (1 % of total project cost),&#13;
including the division of the railway into six regional operations, establishment of interchange&#13;
traffic arrangements and trackage rights, preparation of bidding documents, negotiation of&#13;
concession and lease contracts, transfer of rail assets to concessionaires, closure of RFFSA's&#13;
operational divisions, and the organization and strengthening of RFFSA's technical supervision&#13;
units;&#13;
(b) Staff Retrenchment Program (SRP) (56% of total project cost), including appropriate incentive&#13;
schemes for early retirement, voluntary separation, severance payment schemes for remaining&#13;
redundant staff, retraining programs and outplacement assistance, aiming to reduce RFFSA staff&#13;
by about 18,000, in addition to 4,000 staff that already retired, in order to increase staff&#13;
productivity while minimizing the social costs of staff retrenchment;&#13;
(c) Emergency Rehabilitation Program (ERP) (41 % of total project cost), consisting of the&#13;
emergency rehabilitation, repairs and maintenance of locomotives, wagons and critical sections&#13;
of track which are necessary to avoid further deterioration and traffic losses during the&#13;
restructuring and concessioning process;&#13;
(d) Environmental Management Component (EMC) (less than 1 % of total project cost), including&#13;
environmental audits of railway facilities and strengthening of RFFSA's environmental&#13;
management and safety unit;&#13;
(e) Regulatory Reform Component (RRC) (less than 1 % of total project cost), including the&#13;
development, monitoring and evaluation of railway regulations, strengthening of the railway&#13;
regulatory and supervisory agency (MT/DTF), and establishment of a dispute settlement&#13;
commission (COFER); and&#13;
(f) Financial Restructuring and Settlement Component (FRS) (1.5% of total project cost),&#13;
including establishment of a Settlement Division (SD) within RFFSA and contracting of a Real&#13;
Estate Manager (REM) to manage and sell non-rail assets in order to settle debts and labor&#13;
liabilities.&#13;
3.05   Operations Restructuring and Concessioning (ORC). The proposed six regional concessions&#13;
would result from a consolidation of RFFSA's 12 existing Regional Superintendencies. The Sudeste,&#13;
which carries over 50% of RFFSA's traffic on only 8% of its track length, essentially iron ore and steel&#13;
products, has consistently been profitable. The Centro-Leste and the Sul have a well diversified traffic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
base, in particular petroleum, agricultural and steel products, and construction materials, and RFFSA's&#13;
analyses show strong profitable markets for both concessions. The Oeste also has a strong growth&#13;
potential with agricultural products and fuels. The Tubarao is a single customer (Eletrosul) coal carrier&#13;
railway. The Nordeste has by far the lowest traffic density and productivity; although it might be&#13;
possible to operate it profitably in the long term, in the short term the Government (and possibly state&#13;
and local governments) is likely to have to pay subsidies to ensure adequate services at affordable prices.&#13;
In this case, appropriate mechanisms would be established to specify the concessionaire's public service&#13;
obligations and to ensure reliable funding.  Traffic between these regional systems is currently&#13;
insignificant. However, appropriate operating arrangements would be established to facilitate existing&#13;
and potential traffic between the Sul and Oeste systems and FEPASA, and between Centro-Leste and&#13;
CVRD's Vitoria - Minas railway. An Association of Brazilian Railways would be established to promote&#13;
the operational integration of the systems (Annex 3).&#13;
3.06   RFFSA's operational and operational support divisions would be closed when operation and&#13;
maintenance responsibilities and rail assets are transferred to the concessionaires. The remaining part of&#13;
RFFSA would be reorganized to effectively carry out its future and transitory responsibilities. A new&#13;
Technical Division (TD), with regional units for the four main concessions (Centro-leste, Sul, Sudeste,&#13;
Nordeste) would be established to supervise rail asset leases, operational safety and, by delegation from&#13;
MT/DTF, the technical and the environmental aspects of the concession contracts. The TD would also&#13;
be responsible to supervise any residual public service obligations in the Northeast region (Annex 3).&#13;
Agreement was reached with RFFSA and/or the Government during loan negotiations on: (a) RFFSA to&#13;
restructure its operations, separate rail and non-rail assets, lease its rail assets to eventual concessionaires,&#13;
close its operational divisions and organize its technical supervision divisions; (b) the Government to&#13;
present a plan for the concessioning of the Nordeste operation to the Bank for comments by June 30,&#13;
1997; (c) the Government, through CND and BNDES, to prepare and publish concession bidding&#13;
documents, pre-qualify bidders, and to auction concessions; and (d) the Government, through MT, to&#13;
contract concessions to successful bidders, if any, and to transfer operation and maintenance&#13;
responsibilities to concessionaires, all in accordance with the terms, timetable, indicators and targets of&#13;
the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) (para. 4.05 (a) and Annex 11).&#13;
3.07   Staff Retrenchment Program (SRP). The objectives of the SRP are to reduce RFFSA staff by&#13;
about 18,000 over three years, in addition to the 4,000 employees who retired in 1995, to increase staff&#13;
productivity through retraining and outplacement assistance, and to minimize the social cost of adjustment&#13;
through appropriate severance payments. RFFSA has developed staffing plans for the six regional&#13;
systems, based on redefined operational procedures and consolidated responsibilities, identified the&#13;
number of redundant staff by job categories, and analyzed redundant staff profiles against labor market&#13;
characteristics in the various regions. The SRP was developed on the basis of these analyses, and the&#13;
various parameters have been tested and optimized through an economic analysis (Annexes 4 and 10).&#13;
In addition to legally-required severance payments which, as an average, correspond to 10 months of&#13;
salary, the SRP would include incentives for early retirement and voluntary separation, involuntary&#13;
separation grants for remaining redundant staff, re-training programs based on regional employment&#13;
opportunities, and job searching and outplacement assistance.&#13;
3.08   The SRP would be implemented in two phases in each region: (a) in the first phase, prior to&#13;
concessioning, RFFSA would first implement the incentive schemes for early retirement and voluntary&#13;
separation, which would be offered only to certain categories of redundant staff and within pre-determined&#13;
limits. Depending on the results of the voluntary schemes, RFFSA would then lay off redundant staff&#13;
selectively, taking into account employee performance, and pay an involuntary separation grant; (b) in&#13;
the second phase, after the auction, RFFSA would pay an involuntary separation grant of the same&#13;
amount as in the first phase to remaining redundant staff who would not be hired by the concessionaire,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
up to a maximum number of staff specified in the concession bidding documents. Compensation packages&#13;
for additional layoffs beyond the specified number would be the concessionaire's responsibility.&#13;
3.09   The voluntary separation incentive would be based on the time of employment as per Table 5,&#13;
Annex 4. It would range from 4 to 12 months of salary. The involuntary separation grant would be&#13;
equivalent to 80% of the incentive. The proposed severance payments reflect the importance of the&#13;
Government's social concerns. The packages would also include targeted re-training, which would be&#13;
contracted out to specialized training institutions such as SENAC, SENAI and SEBRAE, and re-&#13;
employment assistance which would be contracted out to a specialized outplacement firm. Beneficiaries&#13;
who would not participate in the training programs would have their separation grants reduced by one&#13;
month of salary. On the basis of the preliminary results of the incentive schemes, it is estimated that&#13;
about 10,000 staff would apply for the incentives, and that the remaining 8,000 redundant staff would&#13;
receive involuntary separation grants. RFFSA's average monthly gross salary being about US$890&#13;
equivalent, the total cost of the severance payments is estimated at US$380 million equivalent. The cost&#13;
of the re-training and outplacement assistance is estimated at about US$15 million equivalent. During&#13;
loan negotiations, agreement was reached with RFFSA and the Government on: (a) the terms and&#13;
conditions of the voluntary and involuntary separation packages, and the terms of reference of the training&#13;
and outplacement assistance (Annex 4); (b) RFFSA not to re-employ program beneficiaries; and (c)&#13;
RFFSA to implement the SRP in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the SRP, and with&#13;
the timetable, indicators and targets of the PIP (para. 4.05 (b) and Annex 11).&#13;
3.10   Emergency Rehabilitation Program  (ERP).  The objectives of the ERP are to carry out&#13;
emergency repairs and maintenance of locomotives, wagons, tracks and other facilities which are&#13;
necessary to allow for continued and safe operations during the restructuring and concessioning process.&#13;
The proposed investments would avoid further traffic and revenue losses by RFFSA and, subsequently,&#13;
by the concessionaires, until the latter can carry out the necessary rehabilitation programs. The ERP&#13;
would include the following components: (a) emergency repairs and/or rehabilitation of about 240&#13;
locomotives to reduce failures (US$110 million equivalent); (b) replacement of locomotive and wagon&#13;
wheels to reduce derailments and wagon conversions (US$16.5 million); (c) emergency repairs of critical&#13;
sections of tracks to maintain safe operations and reduce derailments (US$23.0 million); and (d) small&#13;
investments in signaling and telecommunication systems and workshops to permit the planned reductions&#13;
of manpower (about US$18.5 million equivalent). The design and specifications of the proposed&#13;
investments, and their justification, which shows high financial and economic returns, are presented in&#13;
Annex 5. The investments would be implemented through turnkey-type contracts with private specialized&#13;
firms. The procurement plan and the bidding documents have been completed by RFFSA, and were&#13;
reviewed by the appraisal mission and found satisfactory. During loan negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with RFFSA and the Government on: (a) the description and scope of the ERP; and (b) the ERP&#13;
implementation timetable, indicators and targets included in the PIP (para. 4.05 (c) and Annex 11).&#13;
3.11   Enviromnental Management Component (EMC). The objectives of the EMC are to identify&#13;
and specify responsibilities for the environmental liabilities associated with rail assets to be transferred&#13;
to concessionaires, and to strengthen RFFSA's capabilities to supervise the environmental surveys as well&#13;
as the environmental and safety conditions of the concession contracts. RFFSA would be responsible for&#13;
existing environmental liabilities at the time of concessioning, and for those which cannot be attributed&#13;
to the concessionaires. The EMC would include: (a) environmental surveys and audits of facilities at&#13;
potential pollution sites, including workshops, fueling stations and sleeper treatment plants, to review the&#13;
adequacy of facilities and equipment, identify possible diesel, oil or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) spills,&#13;
define corrective measures and estimate associated costs; and (b) technical assistance and training of staff&#13;
to strengthen RFFSA's environmental management and safety unit (Annex 6). Agreement was reached&#13;
with RFFSA and the Government during loan negotiations on: (a) the strengthening of the environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
management and safety unit through technical assistance and training of staff responsible for the&#13;
supervision of the surveys and, through delegation from DTF, of the environmental and safety conditions&#13;
of the concession contracts; and (b) the description and scope of the EMC, including the carrying out of&#13;
environmental surveys prior to signing the respective concession contracts, in accordance with the&#13;
implementation timetable, indicators and targets included in the PIP (para. 4.05 (d) and Annex 1 1).&#13;
3.12   Regulatory Reform Component (RRC). Railway economic regulations are being developed to:&#13;
(i) allow the concessionaires maximum freedom to set tariffs on services which face competition,&#13;
including differentiating them to account for individual shippers' needs, and entering into confidential&#13;
contracts with shippers; (ii) limit the role of the Government to regulate the tariffs for captive shippers,&#13;
over whom the concessionaire has monopoly power, by the stand-alone costs of the shipper's service;&#13;
(iii) authorize abandonment of lines or services which are shown to be financially not viable; and&#13;
(iv) facilitate inter-concession traffic (Annex 7). The concession contracts would reflect the specific&#13;
regulatory requirements of each concession and their different market and service characteristics.&#13;
Presidential Decree No. 1832, enacted on March 4, 1996, revised the 1985 rail transport regulation.&#13;
Because the Concession Law requires setting up maximum tariffs for concessions awarded on the basis&#13;
of the highest bid price, concession contracts would include such maximum tariff tables, which would&#13;
be updated for inflation in accordance with the Government's price controls imposed through the Plano&#13;
Real law, and which, in practice, would not constrain the concessionaires' freedom. Agreement was&#13;
reached during loan negotiations that the Government, through MT, will: (a) by December 31, 1996,&#13;
present to the Bank for comments a preliminary report on the results of a joint review, with other relevant&#13;
Ministries, of the above-mentioned legislation, taking into account the experience with the existing&#13;
railway concessions; (b) after taking into account the comments of the Bank, submit a final report to the&#13;
relevant authorities; and (c) develop appropriate mechanisms, criteria and guidelines to implement the&#13;
captive shipper rate and the line abandonment regulations prior to concessioning the Sudeste and the&#13;
Nordeste systems respectively. The project would include technical assistance and training of MT staff&#13;
to help develop, implement, and monitor the regulations.&#13;
3.13   The Transport Ministry's Department of Rail Transport (DTF) would be strengthened to&#13;
effectively implement the revised regulation and to supervise the concession contracts, with the exception&#13;
of the technical, environmental and safety-related aspects of such supervision, which would be delegated&#13;
to RFFSA. An independent Rail Transport Commission (COFER), including representatives from the&#13;
concessionaires, the shippers, and from the Government, would be established to resolve disputes between&#13;
the concessionaires, the shippers, and/or the Government. The establishment of COFER was approved&#13;
by the President through a temporary executive measure (Medida Provisoria No. 1342) dated March 12,&#13;
1996. Agreement was reached during loan negotiations that the Government will strengthen DTF and&#13;
establish COFER by December 31, 1996 (para 4.05 (e)).&#13;
3.14   Financial Restructuring and Settlement (FRS).  RFFSA's revenues from  the lease of&#13;
operational assets and from the sale or lease of non-rail assets would be used to repay part of RFFSA's&#13;
debts, and as a guarantee against possible new labor and environmental liabilities. The financing of the&#13;
residual public service obligations in the Northeast would be funded from RFFSA's revenues, by the&#13;
National Treasury from the revenues from the sale of the railway concessions, and/or by state and local&#13;
governments. Some debts, including the debt to the National Social Security Institute (INSS), which led&#13;
to the judicial decisions which hamper RFFSA to sell most of its non-rail assets, would have to be&#13;
rescheduled. The Government is developing a plan to restructure and to settle RFFSA's debts. The plan,&#13;
however, cannot be finalized until the first auctions are completed and until the plan for non-rail assets&#13;
is finalized (para. 3.19). In the short term, RFFSA would establish a Settlement Division (SD), with&#13;
appropriate terms of reference, which will be responsible for managing debts and labor liabilities, and&#13;
for managing and selling the non-rail assets, under contract with a specialized Real Estate Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
firm (REM). RFFSA's reorganization plan is shown in Chart 2, Annex 11. The Head of the SD would&#13;
be accountable to meet the agreed asset sale and debt reduction targets, and a portion of the REM's&#13;
remuneration would be subject to meeting such targets. The project would include funds for the REM&#13;
contract and for the purchase of computer hardware and software. Agreement was reached with RFFSA&#13;
and the Government during loan negotiations on: (a) RFFSA to establish a Settlement Division (SD) and&#13;
to contract a Real Estate Manager (REM), both with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; (b) the&#13;
Government to take a decision by December 31, 1996, to settle RFFSA's debt with the INSS so as to&#13;
enable RFFSA to sell its non-rail assets; (c) the Government to present a plan for RFFSA's financial&#13;
restructuring and debt settlement, including a revised financial projection incorporating payments of the&#13;
rescheduled debts and projected revenues from concessions and asset sales, by June 30, 1997, and&#13;
thereafter implement it, taking into account the comments of the Bank (Annex 8); (d) outline terms of&#13;
reference for the REM contract (Annex 8); and (e) the FRS implementation timetable, indicators and&#13;
targets, including asset sale and debt reduction targets, included in the PIP (para. 4.05 (f) and Annex 11).&#13;
It would be a condition of loan effectiveness that RFFSA has established the Settlement Division with&#13;
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.15   Project Management.  In order to effectively coordinate the implementation of the project,&#13;
RFFSA would restructure and strengthen its Project Management Unit (PMU), which has effectively&#13;
coordinated project preparation, contract a project management consultant, and finalize its Computerized&#13;
Project Management System (CPMS) (para. 4.04).&#13;
C. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
3.16   The total cost of the project is estimated at&#13;
US$700 million  equivalent, including  US$380            Table 3.1: Estinated Project Costs and Financing&#13;

US$65 million for civil works, and about US$10         SeverancePayments      380        -    380&#13;
million  for studies, technical assistance, and        Retraining &amp; Outplact.  10        5     15&#13;
training of railway staff.  The foreign exchange       Goods &amp; Installation    50      155   205&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
of contracts which have already been awarded. Project cost estimates are detailed in Table 1, Annex 11,&#13;
and are summarized in Table 3.1 herewith.&#13;
3.17   The project would be financed from the proposed Bank loan of US$350 million (50% of project&#13;
cost) and from RFFSA and Federal Government counterpart funds (US$350 million or 50%). The&#13;
project financing plan is shown in Table 1, Annex 11, and is summarized in Table 3.1 above. The Bank&#13;
loan would be disbursed against: (a) severance payments at the rate of 50% of total payments (US$170&#13;
million); (b) supply and installation of goods at the rate of 80% of total expenditures (US$106 million);&#13;
(c) supply of goods at the rate of 100% of foreign or local (ex-factory cost) expenditures and 85% of&#13;
other local expenditures (US$20 million); (d) civil works at the rate of 80% of total expenditures&#13;
(US$34 million); and (e) training, outplacement, and technical assistance contracts at the rate of 100%&#13;
of total expenditures (US$20 million). RFFSA would fund 100% specific locomotive and track repair&#13;
and maintenance subprojects from advance payments from shippers (about US$80 million equivalent),&#13;
and contribute to counterpart funding for project components partly financed by the Bank. Agreement&#13;
was reached during loan negotiations on: (a) Borrower guarantee of counterpart funds; and (b) in order&#13;
to enable the Government and RFFSA to keep project implementation on the schedule agreed at appraisal&#13;
in spite of the delays in loan negotiations, retroactive financing, in an amount not exceeding US$70&#13;
million equivalent (20 % of the loan amount), for severance payments, goods and services, and consultant&#13;
and training expenditures incurred not earlier than twelve months before the date of the loan agreement.&#13;
D. Financial Analysis&#13;
3.18  In order to determine a minimum price for each concession, BNDES has been preparing detailed&#13;
financial forecasts, which will be incorporated into the concessions' bidding documents. In the meantime,&#13;
RFFSA has prepared traffic and financial forecasts and a preliminary assessment of the financial viability&#13;
of each concession. RFFSA's forecasts, which are presented in Annex 9, show that, under conservative&#13;
estimates of traffic and revenues, all concessions except the Nordeste would be financially viable. The&#13;
Oeste concession, which has a strong growth potential with grain exports and petroleum products, and&#13;
with its connection with the recently concessionned Oriental railway in Bolivia, could rapidly become&#13;
increasingly profitable. The Centro-Leste concession, which has a well diversified but relatively short&#13;
haul traffic, would become gradually profitable after the planned staff reductions and locomotive repairs,&#13;
despite losses of petroleum traffic to a new pipeline. The Sudeste concession, which carries over 50%&#13;
of RFFSA's traffic, including the bulk of iron ore, will continue to be highly profitable. The Sul&#13;
concession, which has a substantial agricultural export traffic and a strong growth potential with the&#13;
increasing trade between Brazil and Argentina, would also rapidly become profitable. The Tubarao&#13;
concession, a short haul, coal carrier railway serving a power plant, will depend on the position of the&#13;
single shipper. The Nordeste concession, which by far has the lowest traffic density, will not likely&#13;
become profitable in the short term, although a private operator might be able to turn it marginally&#13;
profitable with stringent cost controls and imaginative marketing. The Government might therefore have&#13;
to pay subsidies to ensure adequate service levels and quality at affordable prices and therefore select the&#13;
concessionaire on the basis of the lowest subsidy required.&#13;
3.19   RFFSA management has prepared tentative financial projections for the residual RFFSA. The&#13;
Operations Division (OD), which would be phased out over 1996-97, is expected to break even in 1997,&#13;
after the substantial staff reductions planned for 1996. The Technical Division (TD) would generate a&#13;
net income from the leasing of the rail assets to concessionaires after deduction of its expenses for&#13;
supervising rail assets and the concessionaires' operations. The Settlement Division (SD) would generate&#13;
a net income from the sale of non-rail assets after deduction of real estate management and transaction&#13;
expenses. The net income from the TD and the SD would be used to service and to settle part of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
RFFSA's debts, and as a guarantee against possible future liabilities. The tentative projection shows that&#13;
RFFSA could service its restructured debt and repay up to US$700 million equivalent of principal during&#13;
the period 1996-2000 (Annex 9, Table 7).  The projection, however, is based on a number of&#13;
assumptions, in particular regarding the concession lease prices which will be obtained at the auctions,&#13;
the revenues from the sale of non-rail assets, and the new terms of the debts to be rescheduled. It will&#13;
therefore have to be revised to take into account the results of the first auctions and the actual terms of&#13;
the rescheduled debts. The Government's plan for RFFSA's financial restructuring and debt settlement,&#13;
which would be sent to the Bank for comments, would include a revised financial projection&#13;
(para. 4.05 (f)).&#13;
E. Environmental and Economic Assessments&#13;
3.20   Environmental Analysis. Brazil has adequate environmental legislation and regulations, and MT&#13;
has adopted specific Environmental Guidelines for the transport sector, including railways, which were&#13;
reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank. Railway operators will be required, under concession&#13;
contracts, to comply with the environmental regulations for all their operations and investments. MT's&#13;
Rail Transport Department (DTF) would delegate to RFFSA responsibility for ensuring operators'&#13;
compliance with the regulations. Regarding possible environmental liabilities, the project would include&#13;
environmental surveys of the potential pollution sites, and the concession contracts would specify the&#13;
respective responsibilities of RFFSA and the concessionaires, including RFFSA's responsibilities for any&#13;
existing environmental liabilities at the time of concessioning, or which cannot be attributed to the&#13;
concessionaires. The project is classified in the environmental category B, since the possible adverse&#13;
environmental effects of locomotive, wagon and track repairs can be prevented or mitigated through&#13;
appropriate measures.  In particular, all contractors will be obligated, through appropriate clauses&#13;
incorporated in contracts, to comply with the environmental regulations, and payments to contractors will&#13;
be subject to their full compliance with such clauses. RFFSA would carry out appropriate supervision&#13;
of the contracts, including environmental-related clauses. RFFSA would strengthen its environmental&#13;
management and safety unit and the project would include training of RFFSA staff for this purpose.&#13;
3.21   Project Benefits.  The project, by enabling more efficient, privately operated railway and&#13;
intermodal transport services, would result in an increase of the railways' traffic from about 35 billion&#13;
ton-km in 1996 to about 53 billion ton-km in 2000, and in a 20 percent reduction in freight transport&#13;
costs in Brazil's main corridors. It would thereby contribute to economic growth in agriculture, industry&#13;
and exports. It would also indirectly help relieve congestion on important highways. The direct benefits&#13;
of the staff retrenchment program (SRP) would be the net increases in the marginal productivity of&#13;
redundant staff who are redeployed from RFFSA to another productive activity, and the marginal gain&#13;
from the avoided labor related costs. The direct benefits of the emergency rehabilitation program (ERP)&#13;
would be the avoided costs of locomotive failures and train derailments, and the avoided incremental costs&#13;
of transport of freight which would otherwise, without the ERP, be using trucks. The quantifiable&#13;
economic benefits of the overall project would be thie transport cost savings on existing rail traffic and&#13;
on traffic which would otherwise, without the project, be using trucks. The fiscal implications of the&#13;
project are also expected to be very positive. RFFSA's operational deficit, about US$250 million&#13;
equivalent as an average over the past seven years, is expected to be gradually reduced and eliminated&#13;
after the staff retrenchment program and the concessioning process are completed. RFFSA's expected&#13;
revenues from rail asset leases and from non-rail asset sales could be sufficient to service and to repay&#13;
a portion of its restructured debt over the project's implementation period. The details of the economic&#13;
analyses of the SRP, the ERP, and of the overall project are presented in Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
3.22   Economiic Analysis of the Staff Retrenchment Program. The economic costs of the SRP,&#13;
essentially severance pay and training and outplacement costs, were compared with the economic benefits&#13;
estimated as the marginal productivity of redundant staff re-employed in another activity. A detailed&#13;
analysis of the labor markets in the various regions was carried out to assess re-employment opportunities&#13;
and probabilities and to design the re-training and outplacement programs (Annex 4, section B). Labor&#13;
market data show that the average duration of unemployment is about seven months in most regions,&#13;
except in the Northeast where it is about 14 months. A conservative estimate of the probability for an&#13;
average worker of finding a job within one year is about 80 percent in all regions, except in the Northeast&#13;
where it is about 64 percent. However, those workers who cannot find a job at their previous wage are&#13;
likely to accept a wage cut rather than stay unemployed. Therefore, the probability that all redundant&#13;
staff will be re-employed within one year is actually close to 100 percent in all regions; some redundant&#13;
staff would have to accept average pay cuts of less than 10 percent in most regions, except in the&#13;
Northeast where they would have to accept pay cuts of up to 30 percent. On the basis of the most&#13;
conservative assumptions, the Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of the SRP is estimated at 40&#13;
percent overall, the IERRs for the various concessions ranging from 19 percent for the Nordeste to over&#13;
50 percent for the Sudeste and at RFFSA's headquarters. If workers had to accept a further 10 percent&#13;
wage cut beyond the conservative base case estimates, the IERR of the SRP would still be 36 percent.&#13;
If, on the other hand, it is assumed that, with the proposed re-training and outplacement assistance, all&#13;
redundant staff would be re-employed within one year, the IERR of the SRP would reach 50 percent.&#13;
Therefore, the SRP as designed has a very satisfactory economic justification. The methodology and the&#13;
results of the economic evaluation of the SRP are presented in Annex 10, Section B.&#13;
3.23   Economic Analysis of the Emergency Rehabilitation Program. The economic benefits of&#13;
locomotive rehabilitation were estimated as the avoided costs of locomotive failures and the avoided&#13;
incremental costs of transport of freight which would otherwise, without the program, be diverted to&#13;
trucks. The IERR of the locomotive rehabilitation component is estimated at 43 percent in the base case;&#13;
the estimated IERR would be reduced to 40 percent if benefits were 20 percent lower than expected, and&#13;
to 27 percent if rehabilitation costs were 20 percent higher than expected. The economic benefits of&#13;
locomotive and wagon wheel replacements were estimated as the avoided costs of train derailments. The&#13;
IERR of the wheel replacement component is estimated at 19 percent in the base case; it would be&#13;
reduced to 13 percent if benefits were 20 percent lower than expected and to 14 percent if costs were 20&#13;
percent higher than expected. The economic benefits of the wagon conversion component, which would&#13;
enable RFFSA to capture a highly profitable traffic of manufactured products generated between Brazil&#13;
and Argentina, were estimated as the transport costs savings of shifting from truck to rail transport. The&#13;
IERR of the wagon conversion component is estimated at 60 percent in the base case, at 48 percent if&#13;
benefits were 20 percent lower than expected and at 50 percent if conversion costs were 20 percent higher&#13;
than expected. The economic benefits of track repairs were estimated as the avoided incremental costs&#13;
of train operation due to slow orders and the avoided costs of derailments. The IERR of the track repair&#13;
component is estimated at 19 percent in the base case; at 13 percent if benefits were 20 percent lower&#13;
than expected, and at 14 percent if costs were 20 percent higher than expected. No rates of return were&#13;
calculated for the systems and workshop consolidation components, which are relatively small investments&#13;
necessary to allow for the planned reductions of staff and sales of real estate. Combining the above&#13;
analyses, which include 87 percent of the total ERP investments, excluding deferred maintenance funded&#13;
by RFFSA, the estimated IERR for the ERP overall is 36 percent in the base case. The estimated IERR&#13;
would fall to 31 percent if benefits were 20 percent lower than expected, and to 22 percent if investment&#13;
costs were 20 percent higher than expected, which is still very satisfactory. The methodology and the&#13;
results of the economic evaluation of the ERP are presented in Annex 10, Section C.&#13;
3.24   Economic Analysis of the Project. The economic benefits of the overall project, including the&#13;
restructuring and concessioning of RFFSA operations and the regulatory reform, in addition to the SRP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
and the ERP, were estimated as: (a) the transport cost savings on existing rail traffic to result from the&#13;
improved performance of privately-operated railways; and (b) the transport cost savings on the freight&#13;
traffic which, without the project, would be using trucks, calculated as the difference between the long&#13;
run marginal costs of railways and trucks. Project economic costs and benefits were calculated for the&#13;
entire project as well as for each concession separately. The methodology and the results of the economic&#13;
analyses of the overall project are presented in Annex 10, Section D. The IERR for the project overall&#13;
is estimated at 68 percent in the base case, and its net present value (NPV) ranges between US$1.9 billion&#13;
and US$2.7 billion equivalent for discount rates ranging from 15 percent to 10 percent. The IERRs for&#13;
the concessions range from 20 percent for the Nordeste to over 100 percent for the Sudeste and Oeste&#13;
concessions. The IERR for the project overall would be reduced to 45 percent if the demand for&#13;
transport and/or the benefits were 20 percent lower than expected, and to 50 percent if costs were 20&#13;
percent higher than expected, which is still very satisfactory.&#13;
F. Project Risks&#13;
3.25   The project would be subject to four types of risks. First, Brazil's first large-scale privatization&#13;
of a public service could bring a number of unexpected implementation problems, including legal&#13;
challenges, which could derail the proposed sequential concessioning process. Vested interests may&#13;
attempt to stop, delay or re-direct the process, and Government bureaucracy may not cooperate fully.&#13;
A future Government could even revoke the proposed railway concessions, rehire retrenched railway&#13;
staff, and/or oppose the sale of non-rail assets. The commitment of the Government, the assignment of&#13;
concessioning responsibilities to the National Destatization Council and to BNDES, the proposed labor&#13;
separation incentive schemes, and the project implementation, monitoring and supervision plans mitigate&#13;
such risks, which are taken into account in the conservative implementation timetable. The successful&#13;
auction of the Oeste concession provides additional assurances that the process is now firmly established.&#13;
Second, some concessions which will be brought to auction might not find a buyer. Private investors&#13;
have shown a strong interest in, and are preparing to bid for the the Centro-Leste, Sudeste and Sul&#13;
concessions. The sole customer of the Tubarao line might have to take an interest in the concession and&#13;
either operate it directly or under contract. Although the Government would be committed to present a&#13;
plan for the Nordeste concession to the Bank for comments, there is a real risk that this concession would&#13;
not find a buyer. In this event, the railway might have to be operated under a management contract,&#13;
which would nevertheless represent an improvement over the current public operation.&#13;
3.26   Third, the emergency rehabilitation program could suffer from implementation delays, and/or the&#13;
concessioning process could be accelerated, and some rehabilitation and maintenance works might not&#13;
be needed or could be implemented by the concessionaires. The scope of the emergency rehabilitation&#13;
program might therefore need adjustment during project implementation. Fourth, Brazil's institutions&#13;
and private companies are not familiar with the proposed form of economic regulation and unexpected&#13;
problems could lead to some form of restrictive regulations in such areas as pricing, competitive access&#13;
or line abandonment. Enacting the new regulation for railways prior to concessioning, strengthening DTF&#13;
and establishing the COFER, including the proposed training programs for MT/DTF and RFFSA staff&#13;
and COFER members, are expected to help preserve competition and protect consumers' rights. Overall,&#13;
the project carries real risks, but it also provides an exceptional opportunity to effectively reform Brazil's&#13;
federal railways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
4.01   The Government of Brazil (GOB), the Borrower, would transfer the proceeds of the loan to the&#13;
Federal Railways (RFFSA) on a non-reimbursable basis. GOB under the Loan Agreement (LA) and&#13;
RFFSA under the Project Agreement (PA) would be committed to implement the above project&#13;
components in accordance with institutional responsibilities (section A), organizational arrangements&#13;
(section B), the project implementation plan (section C), procurement arrangements (section D), and&#13;
disbursement, accounting and auditing arrangements (section E) included in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan (PIP). The Bank would monitor and supervise project implementation in accordance with the project&#13;
monitoring and supervision plan (section F).&#13;
4.02   GOB would be responsible for implementing: (a) the concessioning component through the&#13;
National Destatization Council (CND) and the National Bank for Social and Economic Development&#13;
(BNDES); and (b) the regulatory reform component through the Ministry of Transport. RFFSA would&#13;
be responsible for implementing (c) the operations restructuring, (d) the staff retrenchment, (e) the&#13;
emergency rehabilitation, (f) the environmental management, and (g) the financial restructuring and&#13;
settlement components. In particular, GOB, through CND and BNDES, would finalize and issue&#13;
concession bid documents, pre-qualify bidders, and auction concessions in accordance with the timetable&#13;
included in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). GOB, through MT, would enter into contracts with&#13;
the concessionaires who would assume the railways' operations, implement the revised railway regulations&#13;
and, for this purpose, strengthen MT's Department of Rail Transport (DTF) and establish the Rail&#13;
Transport Commission (COFER). RFFSA would in particular: (a) under the operations restructuring&#13;
program, restructure operations. separate operational and non-operational assets, lease rail assets. close&#13;
its operational divisions, and establish technical supervision units; (b) under the staff retrenchment&#13;
program, retrench, indemnify, retrain, and assist redundant staff in finding new employment; (c) uinder&#13;
the emergency rehabilitation program, rehabilitate, repair and/or maintain locomotive, rolling stock and&#13;
critical sections of tracks; (d) under the environmental management component, survey ground pollution&#13;
at workshop and fueling sites, and strengthen its environmental management and safety unit; (e) under&#13;
thefinancial restructuring and settlement component, establish a settlement division to sell non-rail assets&#13;
and to service and settle its debts.&#13;
B. Organizational Arrangements&#13;
4.03   BNDES, which is responsible for implementing the Federal Government's privatization program&#13;
under the direction of the CND. and has already effectively privatized large steel mills, petrochemical&#13;
and other parastatals, has adequate capability within its Privatization Department to auction the railway&#13;
concessions. MT would strengthen its Department of Rail Transport to effectively implement its new&#13;
regulatory and concession supervision functions, and would establish the Rail Transport Commission&#13;
(COFER) to resolve disputes which may arise between shippers, concessionaires and/or the Government,&#13;
in accordance with an agreed plan and timetable (Annex 7). Agreement was reached with GOB during&#13;
loan negotiations on strengthening DTF and establishing COFER by December 31, 1996.&#13;
4.04   RFFSA would restructure its Project Management Unit (PMU), which coordinated project&#13;
preparation, to effectively coordinate project implementation. The Project Coordinator would report&#13;
directly to the President of RFFSA (Chart 2, Annex 11). The PMU would be reorganized into three&#13;
units, responsible for coordinating the staff retrenchment, the emergency rehabilitation, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
institutional components, respectively, and staffed with a least ten qualified professionals. In addition,&#13;
RFFSA's management plans to contract a Project Management consultant (PM) to assist the PMU and&#13;
other divisions in managing the implementation of the project. Also, the PMU would complete the&#13;
installation of a Computerized Project Management System (CPMS), which was started during project&#13;
preparation. RFFSA's Operations Division (DIPRO), which will be gradually phased out, is adequately&#13;
staffed to complete the operations restructuring component. The Development and Marketing Division&#13;
(DICOD), which would become the Technical Division and implement the emergency rehabilitation&#13;
program (ERP), has established and would maintain specific task forces to implement the respective&#13;
components of the ERP. The environmental management and safety unit would be strengthened with&#13;
eight qualified professionals and moved to the Technical Division. The Administration and Finance&#13;
Division (DIAFI), which would implement the staff retrenchment program, has set up and would maintain&#13;
adequate central and regional task forces until the program is completed. The proposed Settlement&#13;
Division (SD) would be responsible for implementing the asset sale and the debt settlement plans.&#13;
Agreement was reached with RFFSA during loan negotiations on the above organizational arrangements&#13;
for project implementation including: (a) the contracting of the Project Management consultant and the&#13;
completion of the installation of the CPMS not later than 90 days after the date of the project agreement;&#13;
(b) the terms of reference for the Project Management consultant; and, as conditions of loan effectiveness:&#13;
(c) the restructuring of the PMU with staff, responsibilities and functions satisfactory to the Bank; and&#13;
(d) the establishment of the Settlement Division with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
C. Project Implementation Plan&#13;
4.05   The Governmnent of Brazil and RFFSA would be committed, under the Loan and Project&#13;
Agreements, to carrying out the project in accordance with the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), which&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
would have to be agreed with the Bank. Goods and services, and civil works contracts below US$5.0&#13;
million, up to an aggregate amount of US$80 million, would be procured through National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) procedures, based on standard bidding documents which were reviewed by the appraisal&#13;
mission and found satisfactory. The value of individual civil works and goods and services contracts is&#13;
expected to vary between US$1.0 and US$20.0 million (total cost about US$180 million). Goods,&#13;
including locomotive and wagon wheels and locomotive batteries would be purchased through ICB&#13;
procedures, in accordance with Bank Guidelines and using relevant standard bidding documents issued&#13;
by the Bank. NCB procedures would be used for contracts for goods below US$350,000 and above&#13;
US$100,000, and shopping procedures would be used for contracts below US$100,000, in the event that&#13;
such contracts are required. Consultants for detailed engineering, construction supervision, technical&#13;
assistance and training programs would be selected and engaged following Bank Guidelines for the Use&#13;
of Consultants (August 1981) and the standard contract issued by the Bank would be used for complex,&#13;
time-based assignments. The cost of these services is expected to aggregate to US$20 million equivalent.&#13;
4.08   RFFSA is the principal implementing agency, responsible for carrying out all procurement.&#13;
RFFSA's organization for and experience with procurement were reviewed during appraisal and found&#13;
satisfactory. The Borrower's procurement law (Law no. 8666 of June 21, 1993) specifically authorizes&#13;
executing agencies to procure goods and services financed by multilateral institutions in accordance with&#13;
the norms and procedures of the financial institutions. All ICB contracts, the first two NCB contracts&#13;
for civil works and for the supply and installation of goods, all contracts with consulting firms estimated&#13;
at US$100,000 equivalent or more, and all contracts with individual consultants estimated at US$50,000&#13;
or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review of bidding documents. These prior-review&#13;
arrangements would cover contracts totaling about 65 % of the total cost of Bank-financed works, goods&#13;
and services. The balance of contracts would be subject to selective ex-post review by the Bank after&#13;
contract award. Agreement was reached with RFFSA during loan negotiations on the above procurement&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
E. Disbursements, Accounting and Audit Arrangements&#13;
4.09   The Bank would disburse for: (a) severance payments at the rate of 50%; goods and services&#13;
(supply and installation contracts) and civil works at the rate of 80% of total expenditures; (c) goods at&#13;
the rates of 100% of foreign expenditures and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost, excluding&#13;
taxes), and 85% of other local expenditures; and (d) consultant services and staff training at the rates of&#13;
100% of expenditures. The allocation of the proceeds of the loan is shown in Table 4, Annex 11. Based&#13;
upon experience with similar projects and the relevant standard disbursement profile for enterprise&#13;
restructuring projects, the implementation period for the project is estimated at four years. The project&#13;
completion date would therefore be June 30, 2000, and the Closing Date would be December 31, 2000.&#13;
The estimated loan disbursement schedule is shown in Table 5, Annex 1 1.&#13;
4.10   Disbursements for severance payments would be made against withdrawal applications which&#13;
would provide all the necessary information on beneficiaries. including employee identification and staff&#13;
number, dates of employment and of separation, latest salary and amount of separation grant paid. These&#13;
applications would contain a certification by an independent auditor satisfactory to the Bank that such&#13;
payments were made in accordance with the agreed provisions of the Staff retrenchment Program. A&#13;
sample of these applications would be reviewed by the Bank prior to disbursement. RFFSA would&#13;
maintain an SRP file with all the related documentation, including the employment contract termination&#13;
document which provides all the necessary information for the computation of the severance&#13;
compensation, and records the employee agreement. The documentation in the files would be periodically&#13;
audited by the independent auditor, and would be made available to Bank supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
4.11   In order to reduce the interval during which the Borrower would finance the Bank's share of&#13;
project cost with their own resources, the Borrower would establish a Special Account (SA) in US dollars&#13;
in a commercial bank to cover local and foreign currency expenditures of the project. The Bank would&#13;
deposit up to US$40.0 million in the SA. The Bank would replenish the Special Account for the amount&#13;
of withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at the request of the Borrower. RFFSA has adequate&#13;
accounting control to enable disbursement to be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
Supporting documentation with respect to expenditures against contracts valued at up to US$5.0 million&#13;
equivalent for supply and installation of goods and civil works, US$350,000 equivalent for goods,&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firm services, and US$50,000 for individual consultants, would&#13;
be retained by RFFSA, be available for inspection by Bank supervision missions, and be subject to&#13;
auditing by the independent auditor. Expenditures for contracts above these limits would be documented.&#13;
During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with RFFSA and the Government on: (a) the above&#13;
disbursement arrangements; and (b) RFFSA to retain an independent auditor, acceptable to the Bank, to&#13;
audit their accounts, including the project accounts, financial statements, severance payments, Special&#13;
Account and Statements of Expenditures, and to furnish the auditor's reports to the Bank not later than&#13;
six months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
F. Monitoring and Supervision Plan&#13;
4.12   The Bank would monitor and supervise the implementation of the project in accordance with the&#13;
Monitoring and Supervision Plan presented in Annex 12. The Bank would monitor the implementation&#13;
of the project against the times chedule and the monitoring indicators and targets, which are set forth in&#13;
the PIP (Chart 1, Table 2, Annex 11). The estimates of Bank monitoring and supervision inputs into key&#13;
activities are shown in the Table 1, Annex 12.&#13;
4.13   RFFSA is developing and would establish an appropriate Computerized Project Management&#13;
System (CPMS) to manage the implementation of the project. The system is designed to produce&#13;
adequate information to report to RFFSA management and to the Bank to permit effective monitoring of&#13;
project implementation against the agreed monitoring indicators and targets.  During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached with RFFSA on: (a) the CPMS to be fully installed not later than 90 days after&#13;
the date of the project agreement; and (b) quarterly progress reports satisfactory to the Bank, to be sent&#13;
not later than one month after the end of each quarter.&#13;
4.14   In supervising the implementation of the project, the Bank would in particular review the&#13;
following documents: (a) withdrawal applications for severance payments and related documentation, on&#13;
a sample basis; (b) procurement documentation for contracts under the ERP and EMC programs, ex-ante&#13;
for all ICB-procured and the first two NCB-procured contracts, and ex-post, on a sample basis, for other&#13;
NCB-procured contracts; (c) terms of reference, invitation letters, short-lists and draft contracts for&#13;
consultant and staff training services, in accordance with the prior-review thresholds set forth in&#13;
para 4.08.&#13;
4.15   Comprehensive reviews of the implementation of the project would be carried out in the month&#13;
of June each year during project implementation, and when 50% of the loan amount allocated to&#13;
severance payments has been disbursed. The review would cover all the agreed actions, target dates, and&#13;
implementation indicators included in the PIP and the status of compliance with all covenants of the Loan&#13;
and Project Agreements. Particular importance would be given to: (a) progress in the restructuring and&#13;
concessioning process; (b) staff reductions, re-training and outplacement assistance; (c) progress under&#13;
the emergency rehabilitation program and the environmental management component; and (d) progress&#13;
under the financial restructuring and settlement program, including achievement of targets for sale of non-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
rail assets and reduction of debt. The Government and RFFSA would be committed to implement all the&#13;
proposed measures as necessary to ensure the efficient completion of the project and the attainment of&#13;
its objectives. The Bank would have the right to exercise appropriate remedies if performance is not&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.01   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of Brazil (GOB) and RFFSA&#13;
on the following:&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Macroeconomic and Structural Reform Background&#13;
A. Macroeconomic Framework&#13;
1.    Since the beginning of 1994, the authorities have been implementing a stabilization&#13;
plan that has been carefully sequenced. The first phase involved a significant tightening of&#13;
fiscal policy to obtain a balance in the operational account of the consolidated public sector.&#13;
The second phase marked the introduction of a new system of indexation of a co-temporaneous&#13;
nature, intended to eliminate inertial components to inflation. The final phase, introduced in&#13;
July 1994, saw the introduction of a new currency, the real, linked to the U.S. dollar and the&#13;
elimination of indexation. Stabilization policies have been based on a nominal exchange rate&#13;
anchor and tight monetary policies. External payments were normalized with a debt and debt&#13;
service reduction agreement with commercial banks and with arrangements under the Paris&#13;
Club as a part of the stabilization plan.&#13;
2.    Inflation has been reduced sharply under the plan from monthly rates of around 40 per&#13;
cent in mid-1994 to below 1 per cent currently. The economy has grown at annual rates of&#13;
over 4 per cent in the post-stabilization period; initially, the major contribution to growth&#13;
arose from a sharp rise in domestic demand associated with a reduced erosion of real incomes&#13;
from inflation, rises in real wages and consumer credit expansion, but after bouts of monetary&#13;
policy tightening since early 1995, domestic demand has moderated and the external&#13;
contribution turned positive.&#13;
3.     The fiscal adjustment seen in 1994 was sharply reversed in 1995, when an operational&#13;
surplus equivalent to 0.5 per cent of GDP was transformed into a deficit of 5 per cent of GDP.&#13;
The underlying deterioration in the fiscal balance is even greater taking account of the strong&#13;
cyclical upturn in 1995. The principal causes of the fiscal loosening lie in a steep rise in the&#13;
public sector wage bill, as minimum wages and public sector pay were increased markedly in&#13;
late 1994 and early 1995, higher social security expenditures (in part related to the rise in&#13;
minimum wage), increases in outlays for interest payments on public debt, and strong increases&#13;
in expenditures at states and municipalities.&#13;
4.     The burden of adjustment has fallen on monetary policies. The authorities have taken&#13;
periodic measures to vary reserve requirements, impose tax and other restrictions on credit&#13;
operations and capital inflows, and have maintained interest rates at very high rates in real&#13;
terms. Real interest rates in monthly terms have ranged at 2 to 3 per cent. The Central Bank&#13;
has engaged in sterilization operations on a massive scale in response to capital inflows -- a&#13;
development, which together with the need to fund the fiscal deficit, had led to a sharp rise in&#13;
public debt to the equivalent of nearly one-third of GDP. A further cause of the rise in the&#13;
public debt lies in Central Bank liquidity support given to several public and one private bank&#13;
in distress. After an initial period of strong re-monetization of the economy in response to the&#13;
fall in inflation, the broad money to GDP ratio has been stable in recent quarters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -                               Annex 1&#13;
5.     Upon its introduction, the real was allowed to float and traded at around 0.82 to the&#13;
U.S. dollar, with an official floor of parity to the dollar. From March 1995, the authorities&#13;
adopted an adjustable exchange rate band system to limit the appreciation in real terms and&#13;
safeguard the external accounts.  The band has since then been depreciated on several&#13;
occasions and currently stands at 0.97 to 1.06 to the dollar. Since its introduction, the real is&#13;
estimated to have appreciated by over 25 per cent in real terms, but from an initial position of&#13;
a strongly competitive economy. The external current account registered a deficit of US$17.7&#13;
billion (2.5 per cent of GDP) in 1995, but with strong capital inflows, gross international&#13;
reserves rose by US$12 billion in the course of the year to stand at US$52 billion by year-end.&#13;
6.     The success with the stabilization plan to date has been encouraging: inflation has been&#13;
sharply reduced, whilst growth has been maintained. Furthermore, the reduction in inflation&#13;
has contributed greatly to a rise in real incomes of the poor. It will also lead to an upturn in&#13;
savings in the economy that is necessary if growth is to be sustained. At the same time,&#13;
reliance on external savings to finance growth has been limited and current account deficits&#13;
have been easily financed. The strengthening of confidence in Brazil has led to large capital&#13;
inflows and to reserve gains.&#13;
7.     Consolidating stabilization in 1996 will require changes in the policy mix in 1996. In&#13;
particular, it will be vital to tighten fiscal policy and to limit the growth in public debt. If&#13;
these can be achieved, the burden on monetary policy will diminish and real interest rates&#13;
could be safely reduced. A stronger fiscal position will, thus, also contribute to some real&#13;
depreciation of the currency and to a better balance between the external current and capital&#13;
accounts.&#13;
8.     Policy adaptations of this type will require strengthening the budget currently before&#13;
Congress and also the passage of several key constitutional amendments that will remove&#13;
constraints to more efficient management of the public sector. These are discussed below.&#13;
B. Structural Reforms&#13;
9.     The Cardoso Government has reinitiated the privatization program, slowed and&#13;
temporarily halted by the predecessor Franco Government. A law was passed in February&#13;
1995, permitting private concessions for electric power distribution and transport of natural&#13;
gas. Several Brazilian state governments have launched programs covering the sale of state&#13;
equity in electricity distribution, telecommunications and the banking sector. Two large state-&#13;
owned banks may have majority equity in private hands by the end of 1996.&#13;
10.    The major reforms to come are follow-ups to the ending of state monopolies in&#13;
telecommunications, petroleum, the gas sector and coastal shipping which also happened in&#13;
1995. In the area of telecommunications, peripheral and value added services are being opened&#13;
to competition. The privatization of the network may be delayed awaiting regulatory reform&#13;
and the complexity of breaking up the existing structure. There are no plans to privatize&#13;
Petrobras but it may collaborate with foreign companies in exploration.&#13;
11.   In electric energy, the Government is seeking partners to finish incomplete existing&#13;
plants. In electricity distribution minority shares are being sold with the publicly owned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -                                Annex 1&#13;
development bank, BNDES, forming a fund where shares may be deposited by state&#13;
governments against future sale.&#13;
12.    The Cardoso Government has reform plans in three other areas; social security, fiscal&#13;
reform and administrative reform. The social security system is a defined benefit regime,&#13;
largely funded by employer and general taxes. It is also biased towards early retirement by&#13;
certain categories of workers. This has resulted in a growing mismatch between payments and&#13;
benefits. Efforts at comprehensive reform, including a move towards a largely capitalized&#13;
system are unlikely to succeed politically at present and the administration's current reform&#13;
goal is a more modest one of correcting the bias towards early retirement and removing some&#13;
of the legislation from constitutional to infra-constitutional status to be dealt with later.&#13;
13.    Administrative reforms would involve allowing layoffs from  the civil service and&#13;
setting limits to salaries plus benefits as well as retirement benefits. Currently no confirmed&#13;
civil servant can be removed from service and enjoying multiple pensions with no overall limit&#13;
on the amount is widespread.&#13;
C. State Finance Reform&#13;
14.    The decline of inflation and the insolvency of several major state-owned banks in 1995&#13;
removed important explicit and implicit sources of financing from the Brazilian states. Their&#13;
deficits rose to 2.5 percent of GDP or about 70 percent of the total national deficit in 1995.&#13;
They also ran up large floating debts to contractors and private banks.&#13;
15.   In order to adjust to the new economic environment the states are considering reform&#13;
plans involving downsizing and rationalizing their workforce, debt workouts and privatizations&#13;
and concessions. Federal programs have been tailored providing incentives in these directions.&#13;
The extent of the program and the degree of commitment to reform varies across states. The&#13;
degree of success will depend not only on their own efforts but also on certain national&#13;
parameters such as the degree of flexibility that emerges from the civil service reform and the&#13;
terms of the debt workout of the state debt which will have to be largely refinanced by the&#13;
Federal Government.&#13;
16.    Finally, fiscal reform is intended to integrate the federal and state tax systems, remove&#13;
the power of granting fiscal incentives from the states and remove the bias against exports and&#13;
capital goods investments present in the current value added tax system.&#13;
17.    At present the social security bill is ready for presentation to the plenary of the&#13;
Congress. The timing and content of the Administrative Reform bill and the fiscal bill are&#13;
uncertain since there is likely to be significant opposition in Congress. The state governors are&#13;
in favor of administrative reform as it will help them financially but are wary of fiscal reform&#13;
which would diminish their power of independent action.&#13;
&#13;

D. Medium-Term Outlook&#13;
18.    The projected GDP growth rates in 1996 and 1997 are 3 percent and 4.5 percent&#13;
respectively. While Brazil has achieved much higher rates of growth in the past, the need to&#13;
keep aggregate demand under control in order to prevent a resurgence of inflation suggests that&#13;
growth will be in this range or even slightly lower in 1996. Gross domestic fixed investment&#13;
is expected to rise steadily, financed largely by growing domestic savings.&#13;
19.    Current account deficits will be contained to below 2.5 percent of GDP. Trends in&#13;
capital flows suggest that deficits of this magnitude can be financed relatively easily.&#13;
According to the Government, the consolidated fiscal account (operational basis) will show a&#13;
deficit of about 2-2.5 percent of GDP or even slightly higher in 1996 but swing into balance&#13;
beyond that. The rate of inflation should gradually decline but will still be in the double digit&#13;
range through 1997. This scenario is posited on the Government making the necessary effort&#13;
to sustain the Real Plan.&#13;
20.    The Government's aim is to reach single digit inflation by 1998, the last year of&#13;
President Cardoso's mandate. So far, the record of economic management has been good.&#13;
The rate of inflation continues to be low and an overheating of the economy was contained&#13;
successfully in 1995. The current account deficit is less than 3 percent of GDP and reserve&#13;
levels are high. The economy is less indexed than in the past and inflationary expectations for&#13;
1996 are favorable. However, there are risks to the program if the reform agenda in the case&#13;
of state reforms and structural changes discussed above are delayed or left incomplete. These&#13;
risks are elaborated below.&#13;
E. Risks&#13;
21.    The biggest risk to the Real Plan comes from the inability of the government so far to&#13;
deal on a permanent and satisfactory basis with the causes of fiscal imbalance that have been&#13;
fundamental in fueling inflation in the past. In spite of substantial increases in revenue post-&#13;
stabilization, the fiscal deficit worsened significantly in 1995. Major changes in federal-state&#13;
fiscal relations, earmarking rules for budgetary receipts, the social security system and civil&#13;
service rules are needed to give federal and state governments the flexibility to balance their&#13;
budgets.   Many  of these  changes  require  Constitutional Amendments  and  further&#13;
complementary legislation. Their passage through Congress has been delayed and resisted by&#13;
interest groups. The outcome is uncertain since the Congress is split into a large number of&#13;
parties with frequent shifts of alliances on specific issues.&#13;
22.   In the absence of a fiscal adjustment the government has relied on an interim policy&#13;
mix which has resulted in high domestic interest rates, growing internal debt and substantial&#13;
short term capital inflows. This can only be sustained if fiscal fundamentals improve. The&#13;
risks of the program, therefor, hinge around the rapidity with which a fiscal adjustment can be&#13;
effected. The financial sector, which has had to adjust rapidly to a decline in inflationary gains&#13;
and tight credit policies also needs to be monitored closely.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Bank Experience with Railway Projects in Brazil and Argentina&#13;
A. Brazil Railway Projects&#13;
I     The Bank approved five loans for railways in Brazil between 1971 and 1987, in addition to&#13;
financing the Carajas railway under the Carajas Iron Ore Project (Loan No. 2196-BR, 1982, US$304.5&#13;
million).&#13;
2.    The First Railway Project  (Loan 786-BR, US$6.0 million, 1971) was to finance the railway&#13;
portion of the Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas (MBR) iron ore project (partly financed by Loan 787-BR)&#13;
to carry 10-12 million tons of iron ore annually from the Aguas Claras mine to the Sepetiba ocean port&#13;
terminal. Although traffic started as planned in July 1973, it was hindered by operational problems, such&#13;
as derailments on the Central Line, whose rehabilitation (financed by RFFSA) took longer than expected.&#13;
Also, delays were encountered in the bridge strengthening program and in completing new workshops.&#13;
The traffic situation improved in 1974, reaching the forecast level by the end of the year. The project did&#13;
not address the institutional issues of RFFSA, and, in the end, the Bank's dialogue with the Government&#13;
on this subject had to take place largely outside the loan's context.  The project was completed in&#13;
December 1977, about three years behind schedule (PPAR No. 4258 dated December 30, 1982).&#13;
3.    The Second Railway Project (Loan 1074-BR, US$175.0 million, January 1975) financed the&#13;
first two years of RFFSA's 1975-1979 investment plan and, in addition, included a program of technical&#13;
assistance.  The main objectives were to enable RFFSA  to meet future demands, particularly in&#13;
transporting iron ore and steel products in the Central, and agricultural products in the Southern, regions.&#13;
Assistance was also provided for the rehabilitation and modernization of the suburban passenger services&#13;
in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. In addition to track rehabilitation, the project included purchase of&#13;
signaling and telecommunications equipment and rolling stock for the suburban services in Rio and Sao&#13;
Paulo, as well as workshop equipment. The project was completed in December 1981, about two-and-a-&#13;
half years behind schedule. In retrospect, it appears that the project, which included a large number of&#13;
individual projects for a total estimated cost of about US$3.2 billion, was too large for the railway to&#13;
implement, and the time schedule was clearly too optimistic. Many components had to be reformulated&#13;
and/or postponed. For institutional development, the measures and actions which were essentially internal&#13;
to RFFSA were successful. Regarding broader questions of policies and relationships with the Federal&#13;
Government, the difficulties involved were underestimated, and the appraisal objectives were mostly not&#13;
achieved (PCR issued on June 22, 1983, PPAR No. 6295 dated June 20, 1986).&#13;
4.    The Third Railway Project (Loan 1171-BR, US$75.0 million, October 1975) financed the first&#13;
two years of the 1975-1979 investment plan of the Sao Paulo State Railway (FEPASA). The objectives of&#13;
the loan were to: (a) rehabilitate and, as necessary, expand the system; (b) improve the operational and&#13;
financial performance of FEPASA; (c) improve suburban passenger services in the Sao Paulo area; and (d)&#13;
strengthen urban transport coordination in the Sao Paulo area. During implementation, it soon became&#13;
evident that the program was too large for FEPASA, which, in any case, lacked the necessary funds. In&#13;
mid-1977, the Bank and FEPASA agreed to redefine the project.  However, the redefinition was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -                                   Annex 2&#13;
complicated by the fact that the loan funds were thinly spread over a large number of items for which the&#13;
bidding process was already advanced; redefinition was completed only in early  1980.   The&#13;
implementation of the redefined project progressed satisfactorily until its completion in October 1983&#13;
(PCR issued on June 29, 1984, PPAR No. 6295 dated June 20, 1986).&#13;
5.     The Federal Railway-Export Corridor-Project (Loan 2563-BR, US$200.0 million, signed July&#13;
1985), includes a policy and institutional development (action plan) component for the rationalization of&#13;
non-commercial railway operations and network and normalization payments by the Government for&#13;
public service obligations, tariff restructuring and better cost-accounting, and more effective operations&#13;
and maintenance management; and an investment component for the rehabilitation and improvement of&#13;
railway and intermodal facilities in the Goias-Minas Gerais and the Parana export corridors.  The&#13;
investment component was completed in early 1995, i.e. about three years behind the appraisal schedule.&#13;
The delays have been due to a combination of macro-economic factors (the unstable macro-economic&#13;
environment and the various stabilization programs have affected the implementation of the contracts and&#13;
RFFSA's financial capacity to fund the project) and management weaknesses, especially in procurement&#13;
and contract management.  The track rehabilitation and improvement works and the signaling and&#13;
telecommunication investments, however, have substantially increased the railway's capacity and&#13;
operational performance in the two corridors, and contributed to the railway's increased modal share in&#13;
the transport of grains and derivatives in particular.  Progress under the policy and institutional&#13;
component was mixed. RFFSA discontinued almost all its inter-city passenger services. The urban train&#13;
systems were transferred to a separate company, CBTU. The railways' freedom to set their rates, which&#13;
had been approved as a condition for the project, became effective in 1990. But the Government did not&#13;
allow RFFSA to close uneconomic branch lines, and did not make the corresponding normalization&#13;
payments. RFFSA's profitable businesses continued to subsidize unremunerative services, especially in&#13;
the Northeast. RFFSA's operational deficits led to the postponment of the maintenance of locomotives&#13;
and tracks and of essential investments, and to the present situation which is characterized by low&#13;
productivity and insufficient service quality (Loan closed on Dec. 31 1994, ICR issued on March 1,&#13;
1996).&#13;
6.     The FEPASA Railway Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2857-BR, US$100 million, July 27, 1987)&#13;
was designed to assist in the financial rehabilitation and improved commercial performance of the Sao&#13;
Paulo State Railway (FEPASA) and in increasing transport efficiency in FEPASA's main corridors&#13;
leading to Sao Paulo and to the port of Santos. The project, which was similar to the RFFSA project (see&#13;
para.5), also suffered from the same implementation problems: substantial delays in the rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of track due both to the macro-economic environment and to project management&#13;
weaknesses; continued operation of unremunerative services, including, in this case, substantial inter-city&#13;
passenger services, and lack of normalization payments for public service obligations; overstaffing and&#13;
inadequate staff compensation leading to low morale and motivation, and to low productivity and service&#13;
quality. (Loan closed on Dec. 31 1995, ICR under preparation).&#13;
7.     Lessons Learned.   The projects have generally achieved their physical objectives, despite&#13;
substantial delays due to a combination of  unstable macro-economic environment and railway&#13;
management weaknesses. The track rehabilitation and capacity investments under the recent projects have&#13;
substantially increased the railway's operational efficiency and modal shares in the main corridors. The&#13;
policy and institutional components, however, have often fallen short of their objectives. Although some&#13;
progress was made under the two recent projects towards a commercially-oriented operation of both&#13;
RFFSA and FEPASA. in particular with the separation of the conmmuter trains, the closure of uneconomic&#13;
inter-city passenger services, the railways' freedom to set their rates, and recent staff reductions,&#13;

Government direct and indirect intervention in the management of the public railways continues to&#13;
adversely affect their operational efficiency and their financial performance.&#13;
B. Argentina Railway Projects&#13;
8.    The Bank has made two loans for railways in Argentina, and has supported the recent reform of&#13;
Argentina Railways through a Public Enterprise Reform Adjustment Project (Loan No. 3291-AR, US$300&#13;
million, 1991).&#13;
9.    The First Railway Project (Loan 733-AR, US$6.5 million after cancellation, April 1971) was&#13;
completed in July 1980 and was based on the Investment Plan of Argentine Railways (FA) for the five-&#13;
year period 1971-1975. The project comprised the first two years (1971-1972) of the Investment Plan,&#13;
together with a plan of action to improve the operations and financial position of FA. Investments of the&#13;
equivalent of US$368 million were proposed during the project period 1971-1972, of which the foreign&#13;
exchange component was estimated at US$172 million equivalent. The Bank loan of US$84 million was&#13;
to finance 23% of the project or 49% of the foreign exchange requirements. The implementation of the&#13;
project ran into trouble almost from the start. The action taken in implementation of the agreed program&#13;
was grossly inadequate, so the Bank decided to stop disbursements in July 1972. After an agreed project&#13;
amendment, project implementation resumed. By February 1974 it was apparent that no progress was&#13;
achieved, and US$27.5 million was canceled. Main features of the project implementation were: (a) the&#13;
project was completed in 1980 instead of 1972; (b) lack of adequate Government funds; (c) a cost-overrun&#13;
of 11%; (d) only 31 % of the 1971-1975 investment prograrn expected to be made by 1975 was actually&#13;
made; and (e) hardly any action was taken by FA to implement the plan of action agreed with the Bank at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
10.   The Second Railway Project (Loan 1677-AR, US$66.4 million after cancellation, March 1979)&#13;
was completed in December 1984. The project was intended to strengthen FA through the redimensioning&#13;
of its system; the rehabilitation of its track and equipment; and the improvement of its management and&#13;
services. Also, through technical assistance and studies, the project aimed to review various aspects of&#13;
FA and to develop its planning and project evaluation capabilities. The objectives were only partially&#13;
achieved, despite a two-year extension of the loan. Frequent changes in top management (five presidents&#13;
between 1979 and 1985), uncertain political conditions, a deteriorating economic situation, and&#13;
accelerated monetary depreciation were significant negative factors. Positive accomplishments included&#13;
reasonable progress on main line rehabilitation and improvement, freight car turnaround time, and boxcar&#13;
modification. The overall IERR was less than expected at appraisal (18% versus 22%), mainly due to the&#13;
resulting below-expectation traffic growth. However, only 4 projects (representing about 20% of the total&#13;
economic cost) had marginal IERRs of about 10%. In none of the project years did FA meet appraisal&#13;
financial targets. The PCR concluded that the project had only limited success and the problems in FA&#13;
were serious enough to require urgent attention by the Government.  A deep FA reform program,&#13;
supported by the Bank, is now underway.&#13;
11.   The Recent Reform.  Ferrocarriles Argentinos (FA) has been divided into three separate&#13;
businesses--freight, intercity passenger, and commuter rail--which were privatized or transferred to the&#13;
provinces in that order. The viable freight network was divided into six separate concessions. The first&#13;
20-year concession was offered in early 1990, and by October 1993 five of the six were in private&#13;
operation. All intercity passenger services were offered to the provinces, but most were ultimately&#13;
abandoned (as mentioned earlier). FA's urban commuter rail services, centered around Buenos Aires,&#13;
were divided into seven separate lines and offered as concessions to the private sector. The municipally-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -                                    Annex 2&#13;
owned subway system was also placed in a concession jointly with one of the seven commuter lines.&#13;
Private operations began on the first concession on January 1, 1994, and by June 1995 all but two of the&#13;
commuter lines had been transferred to the concession winners.&#13;
12.    Reform Outcomes. The outcomes in terms of cost and traffic level and reliability have so far&#13;
been very positive. First, the sector cost much less to the national government since the reforms and the&#13;
need for government subsidy has been cut significantly. Throughout the 1980s, FA required an average&#13;
subsidy of about 0.6% of GDP per year, while the Buenos Aires subway lost approximately $1.5 billion&#13;
per year in the years immediately preceding concessioning. The intercity freight concessionaires now&#13;
receive no subsidy from the national government, while the urban commuter railroads and the subway&#13;
concessionaires are expected to receive a subsidy averaging less than $100 million per year over the life of&#13;
their 12-year concessions, most of which is for capital improvements. These changes have had a direct&#13;
impact on the province, since several provinces provide modest subsidies for intercity passenger services.&#13;
Moreover, while the national government continues to subsidize the only "unsold" intercity freight line&#13;
(Belgrano), one of the options to reduce the burden of this subsidy is to devolve the line to the provinces&#13;
and let them decide if they want to continue operations.&#13;
13.    Second, except for intercity passengers, rail usage is stable or increasing. This suggests that rail&#13;
users as a whole are no worse off or are better off under privatization. In many cases, service quality&#13;
quickly improved. By 1994, in the case of freight, the concessionaires were carrying about the same&#13;
tonnage as in the late 1980s. In 1994, the first year in which some urban rail services were operated by&#13;
concessionaires, reported ridership increased 45 percent on urban conmmuter rail services and 18 percent&#13;
on the subway compared to 1993. Half or more of the reported increase on the commuter railroads is&#13;
thought to be due simply to dramatic reductions in the theft of fare receipts by train staff; the remainder&#13;
and most of the reported gain on the subway is thought to be genuine. The increases in freight traffic are&#13;
due both to increased service reliability and to tariff reductions, while urban passenger growth is largely&#13;
attributed to additional trains, cleanliness, and security.&#13;
14.    Lessons Learned. Three main lessons can be drawn from Argentina's experience in railway&#13;
reform thus far:&#13;
*  Focus on a single bidding criterion. One lesson is the need to be very careful with the choice of&#13;
bidding criteria to award the concession contracts. The Argentinean authorities learned from the&#13;
freight concession experience and substantially simplified the method of bid selection applied to the&#13;
metropolitan commuter railways. Trying to select the winning bid through numerous cumbersome&#13;
criteria with discretional weights is more likely to reduce the efficiency of the bidding process than to&#13;
improve it.  Instead, the terms of the concession should be made clear and known to all potential&#13;
bidders, and bidding should take place on the basis of a single parameter, which encompasses the&#13;
economic assumptions made by the bidders in relation to the terms of the concession. In the case of&#13;
the metropolitan railways concession, for instance, each concessionaire calculated the expected value&#13;
of revenue from operations, compared them to the capital investment programs and then estimated the&#13;
subsidy to be requested from the Government. This subsidy estimate thus reflects the bidder's own&#13;
best estimate of the expected return on the operation. The objective is to make the bidding process and&#13;
the final selection as transparent as possible and not to induce exaggerated or misleading assumptions.&#13;
*  Make flexible contracts.  A second lesson is the need to devise contracts which are inherently&#13;
flexible enough to incorporate unforeseen circumstances. Many freight concessionaires are reportedly&#13;
not meeting the investment promises they made in their bids and are essentially disinvesting in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -                                     Annex 2&#13;
network they were provided by not maintaining their lightly used lines. Although there is some&#13;
question whether the bids were honest from the start, there are logical reasons why these investments&#13;
may not now be needed. In the first place, the truckers responded to improved rail service by&#13;
reducing their rates more sharply than expected, thereby reducing both rail traffic and rail&#13;
profitability. In any event, strictly enforcing some of these contracts is not necessarily in the public's&#13;
interest. In the case of rail, wasteful, unneeded investments would be made or the concessionaire&#13;
forced into bankruptcy, disrupting service until a replacement could be found.&#13;
* Transfer the assets quickly. The third lesson is related to the process of privatization rather than to&#13;
the regulatory instrument or contract design. It suggests the need to shorten to a minimum the time&#13;
between pre-awarding the concession and the start of operations.  The poor state of the assets,&#13;
including track, rolling stock, locomotives, and spare parts, when they are transferred to the&#13;
concessionaire from the public railway is a common complaint among concessionaires. There appears&#13;
to be a gap between what is recorded in the books and in the concession agreements in terms of&#13;
quantity and quality of assets before takeover and what is transferred afterwards to the private&#13;
operator. Given the lack of incentives to carry out and maintain proper inventory purchases on the&#13;
part of the public company, the longer it takes for the transfer to take place, the poorer the state of&#13;
these assets, and the more difficult it is for the private operator to start operations adequately.&#13;

traffic actually flows  CVRD&#13;
today. Almost 80 percent of RFFSA's current traffic would be internal to the new concessions; i.e., it&#13;
would not cross the proposed concession boundaries. If flows to and from CVRD and FEPASA are&#13;
excluded, fully 96 percent of the current internal RFFSA traffic would remain within the proposed&#13;
concession boundaries (Table 1). The tendency for traffic to remain within concession boundaries is&#13;
partly due to gauge standards. While Sudeste is broad gauge, all other RFFSA lines are meter gauge&#13;
(IBRD Map No. 27392). The impact of the difference in gauge can be seen in Table 1, which shows&#13;
that the broad gauge Sudeste tends to interchange much more traffic with the broad gauge lines of&#13;
FEPASA than do Centro-Leste, Sul and Oeste, whereas the meter gauge Centro-Leste interchanges&#13;
more traffic with the meter gauge CVRD. Another factor is geography, both because the distance&#13;
between Northeast Brazil and the rest of the country is great, and because FEPASA divides the RFFSA&#13;
system and tends to hinder interchange of traffic among those parts of RFFSA which have to cross&#13;
FEPASA. In fact, there is no traffic interchanged among Sul and Oeste on the one side of FEPASA&#13;
and any part of RFFSA on the North and East sides of FEPASA.&#13;
2.     In order to facilitate the integration of the future concessions and to foster inter-regional rail&#13;
transport, the project would promote the constitution of an Association of Brazilian Railways (ABF),&#13;
following the model of the Association of American Railroads. The main objectives of the ABF&#13;
would be to:  (a) promote the development of an integrated railway system, capable of offering&#13;
seamless services to shippers across concessions, through effective information systems integrating&#13;
railway operators, shippers and suppliers; and (b) increase railway productivity through technological&#13;
research and development. The Association would be open to all Brazilian railway operators, shippers&#13;
and suppliers. A draft constitution agreement and statutes have been prepared. The project would&#13;
include funds to help finance the necessary studies to initiate the Association's program of activities.&#13;

employment, rolling stock and line data for each RFFSA region and for the proposed concessions are&#13;

- 42 -                                  Annex 3&#13;
B. Traffic Potential&#13;
5.     Oeste.  The Oeste concession, which consists of the Bauru-Corumba line (SR1O), seems&#13;
promising.  Because of the need for fuel in the hinterlands, and the rapid growth of Brazil's&#13;
agricultural production for export, there is a strong growth potential for Oeste's traffic. The tariffs on&#13;
this type of traffic, particularly fuels, are relatively profitable, and the levels of traffic do not yet&#13;
justify a dedicated pipeline. Also, Oeste is the most likely link with the "Oriental" concession in&#13;
Bolivia, a linkage which might generate significant traffic when the Bolivian railway concession is in&#13;
full private operation. An important factor in this concession will be the way in which the connecting&#13;
FEPASA concessions are defined and marketed because all external Oeste traffic must connect with&#13;
either FEPASA or Bolivia. There are indications that FEPASA may permit the winning Oeste&#13;
concessionaire to have trackage rights from Bauru to the Port of Santos. This will need to be clearly&#13;
defined as soon as possible. Even as traffic flows today, Oeste has an average length of haul of about&#13;
740 km, which is the longest of any of the proposed Latin American railway concession.  If&#13;
connections can be made with the linked FEPASA concession, Oeste could be in an advantageous&#13;
position vis a vis trucking competition. Partly because of its long length of haul and locomotive&#13;
productivity (see Table 3 for comparative data), Oeste should be among the more stable concessions as&#13;
Brazil's transport market evolves. Supporting this prognosis, the Oeste concession was successfully&#13;
sold to a US investor consortium in March 1996, for a price that was about R$3 million above the&#13;
minimum  price of R$62 million.  In addition, the Bolivian Oriental concession is now  starting&#13;
operations under the new concessionaire (Cruz Blanca -- the owner of the Chilean rail freight&#13;
concession), so there is a reasonable likelihood that the Oeste traffic patterns will develop rapidly.&#13;
Certainly the ease of marketing the concession lends confidence to the process as planned.&#13;
6.     Centro-Leste.  The Centro-Leste  concession, which incorporates the SR2, SR7 and SR8&#13;
systems, occupies a central position in Brazil's heartland. As a result, it has perhaps the best potential&#13;
for sharing in Brazil's industrial growth which will not be based on a single commodity, as with some&#13;
of the other concessions. Unfortunately it will lose petroleum traffic to a pipeline in the near future,&#13;
which will reduce its near-term growth and profits. Nevertheless, it appears that, even after the loss of&#13;
petroleum traffic, Centro-Leste will enjoy a well-diversified and relatively stable traffic mix. Centro-&#13;
Leste is also unfortunate in having a relatively short (373 krm) length of haul, a level which will&#13;
encourage truck competition.  In addition, Centro-Leste currently has RFFSA's lowest ratio of&#13;
locomotive availability which has clearly constrained output. Overall, while the traffic forecast has&#13;
some limitations, the opportunity for improvements in productivity under private operations should add&#13;
to Centro-Leste's potential interest to bidders, though poor performance will be a problem in the short&#13;
run.&#13;
7.     Sudeste.  The proposed Sudeste concession, which incorporates the SR3 and SR4 regions,&#13;
carries over 52 percent of RFFSA's traffic on only 8 percent of RFFSA's total track km. Further,&#13;
over 80 percent of Sudeste's ton-km is driven by iron ore and steel supplies and products produced by&#13;
a single iron ore company (MBR, 61 percent) and two steel companies (21 percent). Thus, at least the&#13;
North-South route of Sudeste is actually an integral part of the production process for these companies,&#13;
and is not a general carrier like most of the other concessions: it is unlikely that there will be any&#13;
effective competition for Sudeste's traffic from  trucks.  RFFSA  reports have consistently shown&#13;
Sudeste to be profitable on a full cost basis even under RFFSA operation, and the future looks even&#13;
more positive under more efficient management. The key issue with Sudeste will be how to control the&#13;
potential market power of the concessionaire in the event that the iron and steel companies do not elect&#13;
to acquire the concession for their own account and thus become "captive shippers". Alternatively, if a&#13;
group of producers including MBR and the two steel companies forms a consortium and controls the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -                                     Annex 3&#13;
monopsonist shipper/owners.   These regulatory  issues are discussed  in Annex  7.   Sudeste's&#13;
productivity levels are the highest in RFFSA, and approach the levels found in North America. This&#13;
kind of specialized, high volume, medium distance (439 kin), efficient carrier is well positioned to&#13;
keep its traffic base, and should grow at the same rate as the existing iron and steel business.&#13;
8.     Sul. The Sul concession, which incorporates SR5 and SR6, already has a broad mix of traffic&#13;
strongly rooted in the agricultural sector, primarily in soybean exports. Sul will also be the outlet to&#13;
the sea for the new private railway now being constructed (Ferroeste) which is primarily based on&#13;
soybean export traffic. Sul, also, would be one of the most imrnediate beneficiaries of the growth of&#13;
rail traffic which has started to develop after the Mercosul trade agreement. Initial indications are that&#13;
the Mesopotamico concession in Argentina and the Sul concession are already developing international&#13;
traffic from Argentina to Brazil, mostly in containers. RFFSA forecasts for Sul and Centro-Leste&#13;
suggest that there should be a strong market for them.&#13;
9.      Tubarao.  The Tubarao concession, which is the old SR9, is a single purpose carrier (coal)&#13;
serving one customer (Electrosul) over a very short distance (72 km). It is not clear why Tubarao was&#13;
ever included within the national railway network, but its future is wholly bound up with the needs of&#13;
one customer. In this case, the sole customer may need to take an active position in the railway by&#13;
owning the concession and either operating it directly or contracting for its operation. Even though&#13;
Tubarao has a relatively short length of haul its average tariff per ton-km (for coal) is about two to&#13;
three times that of the rest of RFFSA, so there is probably considerable room for a new&#13;
owner/operator to effect economies of operation and save money for Electrosul. At the same time,&#13;
Tubarao's productivity levels are quite low, reflecting its limited market and the fact that traffic has&#13;
shrunk considerably in the last few years.&#13;
10.    Nordeste. The Nordeste concession, by contrast, is to be a "social railway." It has by far the&#13;
lowest traffic density and employee productivity of all of the RFFSA concessions and even the&#13;
relatively optimistic financial forecasts for other concessions do not seriously suggest that Nordeste can&#13;
be profitable. While there may indeed be a possibility that Nordeste could be marginally profitable if&#13;
operated with imaginative marketing and stringent cost controls as in Argentina or Chile, or as with&#13;
US shortline railways, it seems more likely that the kind of high tariffs needed to be profitable in the&#13;
private sector could be unacceptable in the poorest&#13;
region of the country.  Nordeste is thus a potential           Table4- RFFSATraMcProjecdons&#13;
candidate for being a "negative" concession; that is,                1996   1997  1998  1999  2000&#13;
how much would the Government (or Governrments  Oeste                2,041   2,415  2,788  3,081  3,374&#13;
at several levels) have to pay to ensure adequate  Centro-Leste    7,060   7,771  8,482  8,876  9,269&#13;
service levels and quality at an affordable price.&#13;
This is the approach which has been adopted with  Tubarao             106    108   111   115   118&#13;
considerable success in the Buenos Aires suburban  Sul              8,660   9,819 10,979 11,396 11,812&#13;
passenger concessions.   Because of the political&#13;
power of the Northeast constituencies in the Brazilian  Sudeste    22,253  24,208 26,162 28,281 30,400&#13;
Congress, it may not be easy to find a balance  NOreste              886    971  1,055  1,098  1,141&#13;
between the cost of subsidies to the Northeast and the&#13;
need for efficiency and low cost to the national budget. This problem is likely to cause Nordeste to be&#13;
the most difficult concession to complete.&#13;
11.    RFFSA  prepared traffic projections for the six proposed concessions on the basis of the&#13;
available market information and assuming effective private operations and marketing; the projections&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -                                 Annex 3&#13;
are summarized in Table 4. They were used as the basis for developing tentative financial forecasts for&#13;
each concession (Annex 9).&#13;
C. Concessioning Plan&#13;
12.    Each concession is planned to be offered at auction to pre-qualified bidders for a period of 30&#13;
years. BNDES, with technical assistance, is finalizing the preparation of bidding documents and the&#13;
valuation of each concession in order to determine the minimum prices for the auctions. Pre-qualified&#13;
bidders would be allowed to bid at or above the established minimum price, which accounts for both&#13;
the right to operate the concession and the lease of RFFSA's rail assets. Payment is to be made over&#13;
time. First, a down payment equal to a percentage of the total price to be determined in each case&#13;
(10% in the case of the Oeste concession) is to be made shortly after completion of the auction. The&#13;
balance is to be paid through quarterly lease payments to RFFSA over the period of the concession,&#13;
after a grace period of two years. After the auction is successfully completed and the concession is&#13;
awarded to the highest bidder, the Government, through the Ministry of Transport, would enter into&#13;
the concession contract with the concessionaire, and transfer operations and maintenance&#13;
responsibilities from RFFSA to the concessionaire, over a two-month transition period during which&#13;
the activities of both RFFSA and the concessionaire are regulated through a transition contract. At the&#13;
same time, RFFSA would enter into a lease contract with the concessionaire, which would specify the&#13;
terms and conditions of the lease. A tentative timetable for the various concessions has been defined&#13;
conservatively, in order to account for the various project risks. Under the proposed timetable, the six&#13;
concessions would be offered at auction over the 21-month period from March 1996 to December&#13;
1997. The auction for the Oeste concession was successfully completed on March 5, 1996.&#13;
D. Reorganization of RFFSA's Rail Activities&#13;
13.   RFFSA is separating its rail assets, which will be leased to the concessionaires, from its non-&#13;
rail assets, which would be offered for sale to settle its debts. RFFSA's operational and operational&#13;
support divisions would be closed when rail assets are transferred to concessionaires, together with&#13;
operation and maintenance responsibilities. The residual activities of RFFSA will be organized into&#13;
two divisions. A Settlement Division will be established to sell non-rail assets and to manage and settle&#13;
RFFSA's debts (Annex 8).  A new Technical Division, with regional units for the four main&#13;
concessions (Centro-Leste, Sudeste, Sul and Nordeste), would be established to supervise rail asset&#13;
leases. The Technical Division would also supervise the technical, environmental and safety aspects of&#13;
the concession contracts, which would be delegated by MT/DTF to RFFSA under a delegation&#13;
agreement. The Technical Division would also supervise any residual public service obligations of the&#13;
Nordeste concessionaire. RFFSA's reorganization chart is presented in Annex 11. The reorganization&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Staff Retrenchment Program, Retraining and Outplacement Assistance&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.     International experience, including Argentina's recent example for the region, shows&#13;
that productivity gains are one of the most predictable outcomes of railways privatization.&#13;
Productivity gains typically require significant cuts in employment. RFFSA's managers have&#13;
been aware of it for some time. The last formal massive recruitment effort dates from 1985.&#13;
The last time it transformed temporary staff into permanent staff was in 1988, when 2,000&#13;
employees had their status changed to permanent employees.  Recruitment has since been&#13;
frozen. However, Brazil needs cheaper freight services and its labor force needs to move to&#13;
activities where it can be more productive. This means employment in this sector has to be&#13;
reduced significantly.&#13;
2.     When the private concessionaires take over Brazil's freight railways, only 57 percent&#13;
of RFFSA's employees will still have a job. Over 20,000 people will have retired or left the&#13;
company, and the concessionaires may still consider that more staff reductions are needed once&#13;
they assess their needs, including changes in skill mix, consistent with an aggressive&#13;
commercial orientation.&#13;
3.     The Brazilian authorities and RFFSA's managers are concerned with the future of the&#13;
redundant employees. Their reform agenda includes the design of packages to minimize&#13;
adjustment costs to laid-off workers. This annex explains: (a) why it is in Brazil's interest to&#13;
reduce RFFSA's employment; and (b) how the adjustment cost to laid-off workers can be&#13;
minimized.&#13;

reductions in maintenance and investments, which affects the overall performance of the&#13;
sector.' Average indicators of labor productivity in Brazil's railways are much lower than in&#13;
similarly large countries such as the United States or Canada.  It is also lower than in&#13;
Argentina after the railways' privatization, and even lower than in Chile before privatization.&#13;
The resolution of RFFSA's labor problem is therefore critical to the success of the reform.&#13;
5.     There are significant differences in labor productivity  across RFFSA's regions&#13;
(Table 1). A detailed analysis was conducted with the regional managers to assess staffing&#13;
needs for each function performed, and the number of redundant staff.  The number of&#13;
redundant staff was determined for each concession and by employment category on this basis.&#13;
There is also a need to adjust the skill mix by type of employment category, but much of this&#13;
adjustment should be made by the new operators. By the end of this consultation process,&#13;
RFFSA management had reasonable estimates of the staff reduction needs in each concession&#13;
2&#13;
area.&#13;

region.  Minimum  staff reduction requirements for each concession are shown in Table 2.&#13;
This process led in May 1995 to a target for staff reduction of 20,000 employees.  Between&#13;
May 1, 1995 and September 1995, employment was reduced by 1,953 mostly through early&#13;
retirement and staff turnover. By the time the first concession was announced in September&#13;
1995, the new  target was 18,047.  Table 2 shows the distribution of the target across&#13;
concession areas.&#13;
7.     One of the purposes of this analysis is to ensure that, with expected traffic levels, the&#13;
railways could remain fully operational until the private operator takes over, and not be&#13;
hindered by massive voluntary reductions in job categories where reductions were not&#13;
warranted.  These staff reductions are a major step in the right direction, but additional&#13;
reductions may be needed.&#13;
8.     The new employment targets do not imply minimum levels. Once every concessionaire&#13;
has taken over operations, the organization of each system will change and is likely to lead to&#13;
more reduction in staff, some additional changes in skill mixes, and improved productivity.&#13;
But, additional changes in employment are likely to be marginal. For the Oeste concession,&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -                                 Annex 4&#13;
for instance, it is estimated that in the short run 1,800 employees are needed to operate the&#13;
subsystem, in contrast to the 2,736 current employees. It is likely that the private operator&#13;
would be able to operate within a year or two with about 1,400 people or fewer if productivity&#13;
gains observed in Argentina are achieved in Brazil.&#13;
9.     The optimal strategy  might have been  to  leave all decisions to  the private&#13;
concessionaires. But this would not be consistent with the political reality of the country and&#13;
sector. About 80 percent of its workers are represented by one of 7 unions in the sector.&#13;
These seven unions deal only with railway workers, and 54 percent of unionized workers are&#13;
affiliated with them. All the unions are essentially opposed to privatization and reluctant to&#13;
participate in the reform process, although they actively participate in briefing meetings for all&#13;
employees. Leaving it to the private sector to negotiate with the unions undoubtedly would&#13;
have affected the fiscal return of the privatization, and in some cases may have limited the&#13;
interest of the private operator. The advantage of the proposed strategy is that the bulk of the&#13;
adjustment is made before privatization in order to minimize the risk of later conflicts. It also&#13;
has the advantage of ensuring that the social concerns are addressed properly.&#13;
10.    From a macroeconomic perspective, the potential spillovers of these productivity gains&#13;
on Brazil's railways could be quite important. Transport services represent about 4 percent of&#13;
GDP, and railway transport about 16.5 percent of the value-added. Freight transport is an&#13;
expanding sector, increasing at an average of 4.1 percent per annum during the eighties, when&#13;
GDP grew at only 1.5 percent. The restructuring of the sector should lead to an even faster&#13;
expansion based on a larger market share of interregional trade, as it becomes more&#13;
competitive. The internal rates of the return to a more efficient railway are estimated at about&#13;
68 percent for the economy as a whole (Annex 10, section D). This reflects the impacts of&#13;
increased efficiency on all other sectors of the economy, lower prices for all users, and an&#13;
improved distribution of freight traffic between trucks and railways consistent with a better use&#13;
of resources .&#13;
C. Characteristics of RFFSA's Employees&#13;
11.    To minimize the social cost of layoffs, the characteristics of the employees, including&#13;
age, experience, and education level were taken into account, compared to similar&#13;
characteristics in the regional labor market where they will have to compete for a new job. A&#13;
detailed analysis of the characteristics of each regional labor market, and of the reemployment&#13;
opportunities for each retrenched worker, was conducted in preparation for the design of the&#13;
redundancy packages.'&#13;
12     Brazil's regional labor market. The two main characteristics of Brazil's labor market&#13;
are: (a) the modest qualifications of its labor force; and (b) its capacity to generate jobs of&#13;
poor quality.&#13;
13.    The modest qualifications of its labor force reflects the low levels of formal schooling&#13;
and the low quality of basic education. Professional training is not entirely effective even for&#13;
the most educated worker s. Moreover, training on the job is often not sufficient because of the&#13;

-48 -                                          Annex 4&#13;
high turnover in the labor market. There are frequent short spells of unemployment. In many&#13;
cases, these spells result into lower wages when workers return to the labor force.&#13;
Increasingly also, there is a trend toward switching from the status of employee to independent&#13;
contractor.  The main characteristics of the required labor market are summarized in Table 3&#13;
herewith.&#13;

15.     Without assistance, many of the redundant rail workers are likely to find it difficult to&#13;
be competitive in the labor market, and if they find a job, they are likely to be paid less. What&#13;
is needed is enough training to reduce the cost imposed by specialized job experience and the&#13;
lack of formal education. A team composed of advisors from various training institutions was&#13;
convened by RFFSA to prepare a menu of separation options for redundant staff to choose&#13;
from, and to design training packages that best meet the employees' needs.&#13;
D. Staff Retrenchment Program&#13;
16.     The staff retrenchment program  has five components:&#13;
(a)      incentives for early retirement;&#13;
(b)      incentives for voluntary separation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -                               Annex 4&#13;
(c)    training;&#13;
(d)    assistance in job search and outplacement; and&#13;
(e)    compensation for involuntary separation.&#13;
(a) Incentives for Early Retirement&#13;
17.   In January 1995, RFFSA started its efforts to reduce staff with the introduction of a&#13;
program of incentives for early retirement. The main eligibility requirements were that the&#13;
employee had to be at least 50 years old and legally eligible to retire as of December 31, 1998,&#13;
the date when all subsystems would be transferred to private concessionaires.&#13;
18.    The proposed benefits under this program are:&#13;
(a)    payments to the retiree of his/her net salary for a period of six months while&#13;
paperwork is being processed by INSS (the National Social Security Institute);&#13;
this means that for six months the employee receives a salary from RFFSA and&#13;
will eventually be paid his/her pension retroactively for the same period;&#13;
(b)    if the paperwork is not completed within six months, RFFSA will continue&#13;
payments but in the form of an interest-free loan, since the employee will have&#13;
to reimburse all payments made six months after the date of retirement;&#13;
(c)    payment of both the employer's and the employee's shares of the monthly&#13;
complement to social security contribution specific to railways workers for a&#13;
maximum of 5 years until the early retiree reaches the age of 55, which is the&#13;
minimum age to be eligible for payments from this complementary fund&#13;
(REFER). This reduces the incentive for people between 50 and 55 to stay on&#13;
the job to benefit from this additional payment when they reach the age of 55.&#13;
Payments would be made at the time of retirement.&#13;
In 1995, 5,154 employees volunteered to retire under this plan. Eligible employees&#13;
will be able to participate in this plan until the concessionaire assumes operations.  The&#13;
concessionaires would thereafter determine the pension plan which would be offered to their&#13;
employees, and RFFSA would have no more pension obligations.&#13;
(b) Incentives for Voluntary Separation&#13;
19.    The package for voluntary separation is meant to ensure that the employee who&#13;
willingly leaves the company is ready to start his/her own business or is competitive in the&#13;
labor market, and does not have to consider a job that would lead to a significant reduction in&#13;
his/her salary. The main purpose of the incentive package is to comply with a Federal&#13;
guideline requiring that public enterprise retrenchment does not lead to increases in&#13;
4 INSS pays a pension calculated on the basis of the average salary for the last 3 years of work with&#13;
10 years minimum; REFER does not allow retirement at age 50 like INSS, but requires the worker to&#13;
remain until age 55; RFFSA will pay up to five years of both the employee's and the employer's shares of&#13;
the fund so that the employee is allowed to receive a complementary pension when he/she reaches the age&#13;
of 55.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -                                  Annex 4&#13;
unemployment that could threaten the social stability of the country.  Eligibility for the&#13;
packages will be on a first-come-first-served basis, within specified limits by job category.&#13;
20.    The key to achieving this goal is training of redundant staff. For workers interested in&#13;
starting their own business, the program will provide the necessary tools to comply with the&#13;
legal and administrative requirements of self-employment. The redundant employees must also&#13;
select a specific professional training.  For those not interested in starting a business, the&#13;
design of the training programs is targeted to ensure that, after their training, the workers are&#13;
equipped with the tools in demand in their respective regional markets. They also will be&#13;
assisted in their search for employment.&#13;
21.    The terms of eligibility are as follows. All employees are eligible on a first-come-first-&#13;
served basis except for the following:&#13;
(a)    employees who decided not to be associated with the employee savings&#13;
organization FGTS (which is optional);5&#13;
(b)    employees who are eligible for normal retirement;&#13;
(c)    employees entitled to their job because of their status or responsibilities (union&#13;
leaders, representatives of employees in internal commissions to prevent&#13;
accidents (CIPAS); these employees can resign from their responsibilities and&#13;
thus become eligible for the package;&#13;
(d)    pregnant employees;&#13;
(e)    employees on administrative leave; and&#13;
(f)    temporary employees.&#13;
22.    The separation takes effect within 30 days of the decision to accept the application of&#13;
the employee separating voluntarily. During that period, the decisions on the specific benefits&#13;
under the program have to be taken and processed. They include calculation of the financial&#13;
benefits, standard legal entitlements, and incentives, and the preparation of the training which&#13;
is to be taken within 6 months of approval of the separation.&#13;
23.    Financial Incentives.  The financial incentives depend on the number of years of&#13;
service of the employee. To assist the employees in their decision, every office of RFFSA has&#13;
been equipped with software that informs anyone interested of his or her options and computes&#13;
the benefits to be expected. The software calculates the benefits on the basis of the staff ID&#13;
number. The incentive varies from 4 to 12 months of salary, depending on the number of&#13;
years of service. To be eligible for this incentive, a worker should have at least 6 years of&#13;
service. The financial incentives are shown in Table 5 herewith. They are structured as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    for staff with 6 to 25 years of service, the incentive is calculated as an&#13;
increasing geometric progression from 4 to 12 months of salary with&#13;
19 increments of 1.0595 for each year of service;&#13;
5 FGTS: Since 1967, labor laws require that all mixed (or private) companies deposit 8 percent of the&#13;
salary to an employee account, which is a forced savings the employee can only withdraw at retirement or&#13;
involuntary lermination of employment.&#13;

&#13;

(b)    for staff with 25 to 30 years of service, the incentive is calculated as a&#13;

adds up to about $18,000 including the legal entitlements calculated on the basis of the number&#13;
of years of service, age, and contribution to various forced savings accounts. The incentive&#13;
package would be the equivalent of a fund from which the employee can draw while&#13;
unemployed, hence avoiding the kind of traumatic family situation that has been observed in&#13;
many labor redundancy programs. The average duration of unemployment varies from six to&#13;
nine months for most regions. The incentive package would pay a full salary to workers&#13;
during much of their job search period. In addition the package would include training to help&#13;
reduce the job search period, thereby further reducing the probability of social problems.&#13;
(c) Training Program&#13;
25.    To provide an additional incentive to workers to attend training  sessions, the&#13;
employees who will not take the training option will receive one less monthly salary than those&#13;
who will take it. But to ensure that the training is in the best interest of the employees, the&#13;
training program was designed as follows:&#13;
(a)    the regional labor markets in each subsystem was analyzed in detail by a labor&#13;
market specialist of the policy research institute IPEA to identify the nature and&#13;
composition of jobs, relative to supply and demand. This information has been&#13;
used to select the types of training and target the efforts to maximize the&#13;
chances of a match between the skills provided and those needed;&#13;
(b)    each employee who requests training will have his/her training needs assessed&#13;
based on his/her profile assessment (e.g., education, experience, and interest).&#13;
This has already been satisfactorily completed for the workers of the Central&#13;
Administration and of the Oeste concession, who have separated voluntarily;&#13;
and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                                Annex 4&#13;
(c)    every employee will be able to benefit from two types of training, which could&#13;
require about six months of their time.  During that period RFFSA  will&#13;
continue to pay his or her health plan and supplementary pension fund. The&#13;
government will continue paying the unemployment insurance for three&#13;
months.&#13;
26.    Although there is no center specialized in retraining of unemployed workers, Brazil has&#13;
three major training centers which can provide this service: SEBRAE, SENAI and SENAC.&#13;
All three are specialized in retooling employed workers and all have training centers&#13;
throughout Brazil.&#13;
(a)    SEBRAE is an institution specialized in training for starting small and medium&#13;
size businesses.  It provides extensive consulting  services on business,&#13;
accounting, financial or legal aspects of small and medium businesses. Their&#13;
main requirement is that participants have a high school or university degree.&#13;
Training is targeted to employees interested in becoming independent&#13;
businessmen;&#13;
(b)    SENAI specializes in technical training for employees interested in retooling&#13;
their skills for the industrial sector. Most clients have a secondary degree; and&#13;
(c)    SENAC specializes in technical training for employees interested in areas of&#13;
general and commercial services.  Their typical clients have a high school&#13;
diploma.&#13;

specialized .&#13;
SEBRAE is financed by a fee levied on all sectors.  They are typically contracted by&#13;
companies trying to retool their employees; however, individuals also can sign up for specific&#13;
classes, as long as they are willing to pay for them. For this program, the three institutions&#13;
would create new training programs or adapt their programs to the needs of RFFSA's workers.&#13;
Their average fees per person are as follows: SEBRAE, R$2,000; SENAI, R$2,408; and&#13;
SENAC, R$320. The training offered by SEBRAE and SENAI imply an average duration of&#13;
150 hours. SENAC's training is only 40 hours because the implied degree of specialization is&#13;
lower (e.g., hotel services, driver). SENAI also includes a kit to assist trainees to open their&#13;
own business. The largest demand is likely to be for SENAC's program, since the type of&#13;
training offered is well in line with current demand in the labor market, where the fastest&#13;
growing needs are in the services sector. The total cost of the training program is estimated at&#13;
6 The retrenchment program at the Central Administration (AG) where excess employment was estimated&#13;
at 590, was completed in January 1996. The early retirement program absorbed 254 people, 315&#13;
separated voluntarily, and only 21 were involuntarily terminated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                                 Annex 4&#13;
about $10.5 million. An additional $2 million would be needed to train the staff of the&#13;
residual RFFSA.&#13;
28.    A problem with the current institutional arrangement is that the differentiation of the&#13;
training institutes' products (service vs. industry vs. independent business) is imposed by law,&#13;
even if in practice there is not much difference in the content of much of the training they&#13;
provide. This means that there is little room to expose these institutions to a real market test&#13;
that could result in a stronger incentive to ensure that trainees get at a job at least as satisfying&#13;
as they had before.&#13;
29.    A noteworthy aspect of the reform package is that RFFSA will organize a literacy&#13;
program for all staff whether redundant or not. RFFSA is entitled to this training but has&#13;
never applied for it. Since the training is provided by SENAI and is financed out of regular&#13;
contributions to fund SENAI, there is no additional cost involved. It will be part of the&#13;
expected training of the company's staff.&#13;
(d) Assistance for Reemployment&#13;
30.    The reform program  also includes assisting redundant workers in their job search,&#13;
including preparing resumes and providing information about employment opportunities.&#13;
Redundant employees will also be assisted in addressing problems encountered in negotiating&#13;
new employment contracts. A similar type of assistance will be offered to those trying to start&#13;
their own business or to create cooperatives. Training is not a condition to be eligible for this&#13;
service.&#13;
31.    RFFSA is creating a data bank of redundant workers and firms potentially interested in&#13;
the skills of these workers. The service will be available for up to eight months after an&#13;
employee has concluded his or her training. In view of RFFSA's modest experience in this&#13;
area, specialized firms will be hired to provide this service. Regional representation will be a&#13;
requirement for these firms. Moreover, financial assistance to workers in isolated areas may&#13;
be needed to help them reach interview sites.&#13;
32.    An issue some may be concerned with is that the training may only pay lip service to&#13;
the need of the workers. One solution would be to link the payment for training to the success&#13;
of the employee in his or her choice in the job market. But this cannot be implemented in this&#13;
project. Since RFFSA had already negotiated a fee with each of the training units before the&#13;
Bank's involvement, there is no room to built in better incentives in these fees. The alternative&#13;
is to add on a success fee of 10 to 20 percent for every worker that gets an equivalent or better&#13;
job and keeps it for at least a year to the firm that is responsible to assist the workers in&#13;
finding a new job. Criteria to measure success of the training program will have to be devised,&#13;
however, achieving the market average based on worker qualification and experience would be&#13;
a reasonable approach. It is likely that unions would favor maintaining the current salary or&#13;
obtaining a better one.&#13;
33.    To ensure that the training follows its proper course, the firm  responsible for the&#13;
reemployment program would also be requested to supervise its implementation. To the extent&#13;
that the success fee is sufficient, it will provide an additional incentive to this firm to perform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                               Annex 4&#13;
in this monitoring role. The "reform team" in RFFSA will supervise the overall process and&#13;
ensure coordination.&#13;
(e) Compensation for Involuntary Separation&#13;
34.   If  enough workers have not left voluntarily with incentives or through early&#13;
retirement, involuntary separation will occur. This will not necessarily be fully implemented&#13;
by the time the concessionaire takes over. However, even after concessioning, RFFSA will&#13;
monitor the staff reductions until the targets are achieved. The workers dismissed under this&#13;
third phase will receive only 80 percent of the value of the financial package offered to&#13;
workers separating voluntarily; however, they will enjoy all other benefits provided to workers&#13;
separating voluntarily, including assistance in job search and training. There is an incentive&#13;
for them to obtain training since their financial package is subject to the same penalty, i.e., one&#13;
month's salary, if they decide not to take any training.&#13;
35.    There is concern with the need to avoid firing people who are good performers and to&#13;
avoid creating difficult personal situations by firing people who have significant social&#13;
responsibilities. Information available in the personnel files is being used in the selection of&#13;
staff to be declared involuntarily redundant. Selection of candidates would be based on the&#13;
following criteria:&#13;
(a)    record of attendance level;&#13;
(b)    frequency of penalties or suspensions;&#13;
(c)    overall performance evaluation by the immediate supervisor; and&#13;
(d)    family situation (e.g., marital status, number of children).&#13;
36.    These workers will still get on average $17,751 in legal entitlements. However, they&#13;
will receive only $8,000 on average in incentives, 20 percent less than the workers who&#13;
volunteered. Including the value of training, this is still about $10,000 more than the legal&#13;
requirement, and represents 6 to 8 times the average monthly wage in most regional labor&#13;
markets.&#13;
E. Sequencing, Timing and Implementation&#13;
37.    While it is obviously very difficult to predict the exact distribution of workers across&#13;
incentive packages, RFFSA tried to do so based on small surveys in consultation with regional&#13;
managers. It is expected that the incentive packages are attractive enough to minimize the need&#13;
to have to rely on involuntary separation. With the exception of Tubarao, where 53 percent of&#13;
workers (30 staff) will lose their job involuntarily, on average only a small proportion of the&#13;
workers is expected to be in that situation.  On the basis of experience with the Central&#13;
Administration and Oeste concession, the package seems attractive enough, and well designed.&#13;
38.    The staff reductions will be achieved in three stages and each will imply a very&#13;
different time-table, tenure and responsibility. The first is the reduction of staff through early&#13;
retirement. This new plan began in January 1995 and will continue until December 1998,&#13;
when all subsystems should have been transferred to private concessionaires. The second stage&#13;
is voluntary separation, with a timetable for each subsystem beginning with the Central&#13;
administration. Workers have 15 days to decide after the announcement of the availability of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                                   Annex 4&#13;
the package. RFFSA is responsible for carrying out this second phase. The final stage is&#13;
involuntary separation. The process ends when the targeted reduction is achieved. Therefore,&#13;
part of the program will be implemented after the concessionaire has assumed operations. It is&#13;
estimated that about 4,400 employees would be retrenched after the respective concessions&#13;
have been awarded.&#13;
39.    If an employee retires, the value of the package is not affected by the timing of the&#13;
decision as long as it takes place&#13;
before  the  concessionaire  takes   Table 8 - Tunetable for the hnplementation or Separation and Training&#13;

about $10,000 in entitlements from   31/12/98         21,000        8,300    12,700      6,350&#13;
normal labor law (this is what any   30/06/99         22,000        8.900    13,100      6,550&#13;
private company would have to pay). In addition, workers will get on average the equivalent&#13;
of $2,000 worth of training; it will take up to six months to complete but could be shorter if a&#13;
job is found. If the worker becomes redundant involuntarily, 80 percent of the incentive&#13;
package and training and outplacement assistance are provided. The worker also gets extended&#13;
protection in comparison to what would be given in a private company. Indeed, if the private&#13;
concessionaire decides that the targeted reduction is not enough, it can cut staff further.&#13;
However, during the first 12 months of his/her contract, the concessionaire will have to pay&#13;
the same benefit that RFFSA paid to the workers declared redundant involuntarily. After 12&#13;
months, however, any worker fired would receive an entitlement from normal labor law (about&#13;
$10,000 for the average employee of RFFSA). The timetable for each option is given in&#13;
Table 8).&#13;
40.    A  problem  with this sequencing is that RFFSA  has no leverage over how  the&#13;
concessionaire will decide to staff its company. It is conceivable that a concessionaire would&#13;
be able to recruit someone who left and receives an incentive package. If this happens within&#13;
the first 12 months of operation on the concession, the private operator must reimburse RFFSA&#13;
for the cost of the incentive package and the training. While this was not stipulated in the&#13;
bidding documents for Bauru, it should be included in the next subsequent documents.&#13;
41.     After the first year of operation, anyone can be rehired. The labor law impedes any&#13;
restriction to recruitment, including people who received a package. The only restriction is&#13;
that any worker accepting a package will never again be able to work for RFFSA.&#13;
42.    Finally, these options are being discussed in great detail with all workers. With only&#13;
his or her ID number in hand, any worker can find out how much cash he or she would receive&#13;
when leaving. Every local office has access to a computer that can provide that information,&#13;
and the system appears to be used effectively. Every worker also receives information on each&#13;
option and expresses preferences. Since there is a literacy problem, RFFSA is also providing&#13;
special assistance in explaining the options. In Bauru, for example. oral presentations have&#13;
been attended by more than a third of the workforce.  Union representatives also attended&#13;
officially and while expressing concern with the loss of positions, recognized that the effort&#13;
made to minimize the social cost of redundancy was unusual.&#13;
&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Emergency Rehabilitation Program&#13;
1.    The capital investment component of the loan is divided into six components: (a) a locomotive&#13;
rehabilitation ($106 million) to increase fleet availability thus increasing traffic carried and decreasing&#13;
the costs of locomotive failure; (b) a wheel replacement on both locomotives and wagons ($9.4&#13;
million) to reduce derailments; (c) a conversion of freight wagons to container flat-wagons to capture&#13;
traffic now growing as a result of Mercosul development ($3 million); (d) a minimum track repair&#13;
program ($23.3 million) to maintain safe operation and reduce derailments; (e) limited systems&#13;
investments primarily in signaling and remote switch control ($6.5 million) needed to permit planned&#13;
manpower reductions to proceed; and (f) a program to close down and consolidate rolling stock repair&#13;
shops ($11.2 million) to meet manpower reduction and asset sale targets. This investment program is&#13;
needed to ensure that RFFSA will not substantially decrease its performance during the transition&#13;
period to the concessions. Experience in Argentina and elsewhere has shown that during the transition&#13;
period to concessions, locomotives and rolling stock rapidly deteriorate, which substantially decreases&#13;
the performance of the railway to levels well below those indicated in the bidding documents.&#13;
Therefore, concessionaires would have to carry out a substantial amount of emergency repairs,&#13;
affecting demand which then switches to other modes and takes a long time to recapture. The proposed&#13;
rehabilitation program is the result of lessons learned in other systems, particularly in Argentina. It&#13;
will prevent further deterioration of equipment and essential infrastructure.  The concessionaires&#13;
would still have to invest their own funds to make the concessions a profitable operation.&#13;
A. Locomotive Rehabilitation&#13;
2.     At present, as a result of deferred maintenance, only about 52 percent of RFFSA's locomotive&#13;
fleet is operative, and those in operation are highly prone to failure en route. This imposes two costs&#13;
on the system: traffic is refused because there are not enough locomotives available to haul the traffic&#13;
on offer, and operating costs are much higher than necessary because on-line failures are more costly&#13;
than preventive maintenance. The situation has become so difficult that there will be little tractive&#13;
power left to hand over the concessionaires, and the concession value will suffer accordingly, if some&#13;
repairs are not effected in the very near term. RFFSA plans to take 240 of their current fleet of 901&#13;
locomotives, of which only 420 are in operation currently, and contract out the necessary&#13;
rehabilitation, which will yield much higher reliability and availability for an estimated eight-year&#13;
period. The program would help ensure an effective transition from RFFSA's to the concessionaire's&#13;
operation.  Table 1 hereafter shows the characteristics and condition of the locomotives to be&#13;
rehabilitated.&#13;

$5,000. The average cost per locomotive for the rehabilitation program is $440,000, ranging from&#13;
$350,000  to  $500,000, which  compares with  a new  locomotive price  of about $2,000,000.   The&#13;

4.     The results are also quite robust with respect to the base    Table 3 - Locomotive Program:&#13;
parameters.  The base case financial  rate of return for the entire             Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
component is 50 percent. A 20 percent reduction in the calculated cost           Rate of Retum (%)&#13;

limited number of locomotive&#13;
wheels (about 2,400) are also to be replaced. Due to limited historical data, RFFSA cannot distinguish&#13;
between the consequences of locomotive derailments and wagon derailments. All investments have&#13;
been analyzed as if they were wagon derailment costs. This is conservative as a locomotive derailment&#13;
is much more costly to repair than a wagon derailment. RFFSA records indicate that derailments due&#13;
to bad wheels cost around $2.7 million per year in lost revenues and added labor costs. Assuming&#13;
that these costs can be reduced by about 80 percent through the replacement of bad wheels, the wheel&#13;
replacement program would have an estimated rate of return of 19% (Table 5).&#13;
6.     The base case financial rate of return of 19 percent is also a&#13;
relatively robust result: a change in the derailment reduction by 20            Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
percent would reduce the rate of return to 13 percent. An increase in           Rate of Return (%)&#13;
the replacement cost of 20 percent would reduce the rate of return to   Base Case          19&#13;
14 percent. Given the conservative nature of the original calculation,   Benefits -20%    13&#13;
(i.e., there is no allowance for the higher cost of locomotive wheel   Costs +20%          14&#13;
faults, no allowance for the non-operating costs of derailments such as   Both            8&#13;
human injury or environmental clean-up, and no allowance for lost cargo value), there is good reason&#13;
to conclude that the wheel replacement program will have an acceptable return for RFFSA and the&#13;
concessionaires.&#13;
C. Wagon Conversion&#13;
7.     As a result of the Mercosul Trade Agreement, trade between Brazil and Argentina is increasing&#13;
rapidly, especially in higher-valued manufactured products. Transport alternatives for this trade are&#13;
truck or rail. Rail movements necessitate a change of gauge at the Brazil/Argentina border since the&#13;
Argentine Mesopotamico Railway is standard gauge, and Sul is meter gauge. These two factors --&#13;
higher-value products needing better service and the change of gauge at the border -- combine to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59 -                                        Annex 5&#13;
encourage growth in rail-hauled containers if rail is to be competitive. In 1995, for example, RFFSA's&#13;
container traffic grew at about 20 percent per year.&#13;
8.     In the long run, as traffic increases, the Sul concessionaire is likely to invest in specialized&#13;
equipment. RFFSA currently has available 300 flat wagons that can be converted rapidly at a cost of&#13;
about $10,000 per wagon. These wagons will be suitable in the short run, and will have a ten-year&#13;
life. Discussions with a potential concessionaire confirm that the equipment would be consistent with&#13;
current plans and would be used as planned. On this basis, the value of the conversion program will&#13;
be reflected in the bids received.&#13;
9.     On  the  basis  of a  relatively  conservative  wagon   Table 7 - Wagon Conversion Program:&#13;
productivity of 540,000 ton-km per wagon annually and of a net             Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
incremental financial revenue of about .005 Reals per ton-km (as   Rate of Return (%)&#13;
compared  to  the  total revenue  of .024  Reals/ton-km  for   Base Case             23&#13;
container traffic) the financial rate of return was estimated at   Costs +20%        18&#13;
23%.                                                               Both              12&#13;
10.    The rate of return for the conversion program  is robust.  A reduction of 20%  in the net&#13;
benefits still yield a rate of return of 17 percent. A 20 percent increase in the conversion cost would&#13;
still yield 18 percent rate of return. Under both assumptions together, the rate of return would still be&#13;
a satisfactory 12 percent (Table 7).&#13;
D. Track Repairs&#13;
11.    Shortage of capital has caused undermaintenance of track and infrastructure which has led to&#13;
increased derailments and safety risks, especially in areas where RFFSA carries hazardous cargoes.&#13;
Since RFFSA's traffic mix in many regions is weighted toward petroleum products, there are many&#13;
points at which a safety risk exists. An immediate program of rehabilitation is needed on the parts of&#13;
the network which carry higher density traffic and are thus exposed to higher risks of derailment.&#13;
Because it is basic work aimed at the higher priority parts of the network, the maintenance work will&#13;
be needed whoever is operating the tracks.   Further, as the Government remains the owner of the&#13;
track and structures, the value of the work accrues to the Government both in asset ownership and in&#13;
the value of the bids received for the concession.&#13;
12.    The program  would cost in total about $23.3               Table 8 - Track Repair Program&#13;
million, and will include the replacement of sleepers,                Sleepers    Rail         Ballast&#13;
rails and ballasts (Table 8 herewith). For perspective,                (units)   (tons)   (cubic meters)&#13;
there are about 1,800 sleepers, 100 tons of rail, and   Nordeste       50,046    --            16,800&#13;
1,000 cubic meters of ballast per km  of line, and   Centro-Leste   42,285    3,000            15,504&#13;
RFFSA currently has 22,000 km of line. In addition,   Sudeste          77,589     270           2,900&#13;
the  program   includes  minor  works  on   other&#13;
infrastructure facilities.&#13;
13.    The benefits to be derived from the track repair component    Table 9-Track Repair Program:&#13;
are the reduced derailments of trains. RFFSA statistics show that 48           Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
percent of the derailments are attributed to tracks.  It was assumed   Rates of Return    Financial&#13;
conservatively that the proposed track repairs would reduce the costs   Base           19&#13;
of such derailments by 15%. On this basis, the rate of return was   Costs +20%          14&#13;
estimated at 19%.  If benefits were 20%  lower than expected, the   Both                9&#13;
rate of return would be about 13 %. If costs were 20% higher than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                                         Annex 5&#13;
expected, the rate of return would be 14% (Table 9). There are other important benefits, such as&#13;
improved human safety and reduced environmental risks, but they are not easily quantifiable. There is&#13;
no question that the investment is needed if the lines are to continue in service, whoever operates them,&#13;
and the value will accrue to the Government.&#13;
E. System Investments&#13;
14.    System  investments comprise primarily telecommunication and signaling systems (autornation&#13;
of control of remote switches) which today require independent staffing (Table 10). This program,&#13;
which is estimated to cost about US$6.5 million equivalent, will reduce operating costs and increase&#13;
the ability to operate the railway safely and reliably. The investment is necessary to support the&#13;
already committed manpower reduction program. It will be needed by concessionaires. No rate of&#13;
return for the component has been calculated because the annual operating savings in manpower alone&#13;
are in excess of US$9 million. Costs will be recovered by RFFSA before concessioning in most&#13;
cases, and will accrue to the Government in the value of the bids received.&#13;

F. Relocation of Maintenance Facility&#13;
15.    RFFSA  has too many maintenance shops scattered over the system.  The concessioning&#13;
program will require shop consolidation both in order to reduce costs and in order to free surplus&#13;
property for subsequent development. Also, in many cases RFFSA shops are in urban areas where&#13;
closing the shop will trigger an immediate need to make the shop area available for other uses. The&#13;
program ($ 6.5 million) consists of closing and relocating equipment from about 42 facilities ranging&#13;
from small, general purpose facilities to larger rolling stock shops, including 15 in Nordeste, 14 in&#13;
Centro-Leste, 5 in Sudeste, and 8 in Sul.&#13;
16.    Because of the diverse nature of the activities involved, no rate of return was calculated for this&#13;
part of the program. Shop relocation is an important part of RFFSA's consolidation in support of&#13;
concessioning, and labor savings alone are expected to repay the investment in the first year after&#13;
relocation. In addition, the revenues of such subsequent sale of real estate should largely exceed the&#13;
cost of relocation and consolidation.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Management Component&#13;
A. RFFSA's Environmental Management and Safety Unit&#13;
1.    RFFSA  has created an Environmental Management and Safety (EMSU) unit, with the&#13;
following functions: plan, study, supervise, coordinate, and monitor activities related to environmental&#13;
protection, threats to human life, damage control, human health, fauna, flora and natural resources, so&#13;
as to prevent damage, enhance the value of the railroad, and promote safety, confidence, and better&#13;
quality of life. EMSU is in particular responsible for the preparation of environmental protection&#13;
standards and procedures, traffic safety rules, work safety measures, and risk assessment.&#13;
2.     With the proposed restructuring and concessioning of RFFSA's operations, and the proposed&#13;
delegation by MT/DTF of the environmental and safety supervision of the concessions, the EMSU will&#13;
have the following responsibilities:&#13;
(a)  prepare, supervise and monitor the environmental and safety standards for the&#13;
installations, equipment, and activities of RFFSA and the concessionaires, on the basis of&#13;
existing laws and regulations, ensuring their compliance in order to avoid accidents, fires,&#13;
spills, ruptures, pollution, and other environmental damage;&#13;
(b) monitor the condition of installations, equipment, and activities of RFFSA and the&#13;
concessionaires to ensure compliance with regulations and laws required for environmental&#13;
protection;&#13;
(c) establish procedures and help develop and execute emergency plans in case of fire, spills,&#13;
ruptures, and other potential catastrophes with the possibility of damage to soil, air, water,&#13;
vegetation, animal and human life, a well as company assets and assets of others;&#13;
(d) establish procedures to coordinate and monitor the inspection of RFFSA's and the&#13;
concessionaires' activities, suggesting preventive or corrective measures as necessary to&#13;
ensure environmental risk prevention and control;&#13;
(e) prepare and monitor compliance with regulations and procedures for collection and&#13;
destination of industrial and sanitary wastes and effluents so as to ensure appropriate&#13;
environmental protection;&#13;
(f) prepare regulations, directives, and methodologies for specific training about&#13;
environmental risk prevention and control, and improve the ability to execute tasks and/or&#13;
responding to emergencies that occur from the transport of environmentally hazardous&#13;
products;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -                                  Annex 6&#13;
(g) help reduce railway accidents involving RFFSA, and monitor concessionaires' accidents&#13;
with the objective of reaching internationally comparable standards;&#13;
(h) research, supervise, coordinate, and manage activities concerning railway accidents,&#13;
collecting and maintaining relevant statistical data;&#13;
(i) establish and enforce compliance with rules and guidelines concerning inspection of&#13;
equipment and installations, in order to reduce railway accidents or other potential risks that&#13;
could be detected through preventive inspections;&#13;
(j) manage, record, and disseminate the management information necessary to interact&#13;
effectively with others units; and&#13;
(k) oversee the reduction of environmental liabilities caused by RFFSA in the past.&#13;
B. Environmental Management Work Program&#13;
3.      The Environmental Management Program  was set up  in the context of RFFSA's&#13;
Environmental Policy mandate, applying modern risk management techniques as the basic strategy of&#13;
the EMSU. Many of the following activities will be executed simultaneously with RFFSA's other&#13;
activities including for the concessionaires. The program has four basic activities: (i) risk&#13;
identification; (ii) risk prevention and control; (iii) damage control; and (iv) analysis and feedback.&#13;
(a) Risk Identiflcation&#13;
4.      This activity consists of the diagnosis of potential safety problems or hazardous situations&#13;
before the environmental risks occur. It includes detection of risks, analysis, evaluation, and&#13;
establishment of control procedures. Specifically, risks would be identified through inspections as well&#13;
as through the definition of environmental risks originating from sources not directly related to railway&#13;
operations that affect the internal and external environment, employees, and assets, including:&#13;
- radioactive sources;&#13;
- Ascarel depots (Normative Instruction SEMA/STC/CRS/N° 001/83, Instruction 019/81 MI,&#13;
MIC, MME);&#13;
- Ascarel in use;&#13;
- effluents contaminated by petroleum derivatives (Resolution 02/85 CNP);&#13;
- petroleum derivative spills;&#13;
- spills and ruptures of inflammable deposits;&#13;
- stored agrotoxics (Instruction 157/82 Ml - stored wood preservatives);&#13;
- pentachloro-diphenyl (PCD) deposits;&#13;
- effluents from wood-treatment factories;&#13;
- pollutant products used in work, deposits, and workshops;&#13;
- scrap containing pollutant metals such as mercury (Hg) and others;&#13;
- emanation of pollutants and unhealthy gases (Instruction 3214/78 MTb, Instruction 231/76&#13;
MI - Air Quality Standards);&#13;
- ambient dust;&#13;
- excessive noise sources (Instruction 092/80 MI - Noise Emissions, Resolution 001/90 -&#13;
CONAMA, Instruction 3214/78 MTh - Heat Sources - Instruction 3214/78MTb);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                                 Annex 6&#13;
- deficient illumination;&#13;
- insufficient ventilation;&#13;
- solid residues (Instruction 053/79 MI, Resolution CONAMA no 006/88);&#13;
- quality of liquid effluents in rivers (Resolution CONAMA n° 20/86);&#13;
- others to be detected.&#13;
(b) Risk Prevention and Control&#13;
5.      This activity consists of eliminating risks whenever possible, implementing measures to avoid&#13;
additional risks, and operationalizing the Dangerous Products Informatics System. Environmental&#13;
audits are intended to guarantee and sustain preventive procedures and risk control, ensuring that such&#13;
risks minimize damage due to control failures.&#13;
(c) Damage Control&#13;
6.      This activity includes attempts to control or minimize damage when risk controls fail. It&#13;
includes emergency plans, liaison contingency plans, equipment, simulated accident exercises, specific&#13;
trainings, and projects to repair damage.&#13;
(d) Analysis and Feedback&#13;
7.      This activity includes recording of past occurrences and periodic reporting. Data are&#13;
analyzed, failures reported, occurrences related to specific legislation, and recommendations and&#13;
programs of actions formulated, ensuring appropriate feedback to the program. It would include:&#13;
(a) collection and records of data on accidents involving environmental damage that happened&#13;
in the past 5 years, and establishment of data base;&#13;
(b) preparation and dissemination of monthly activity reports;&#13;
(c) analysis of data and reports providing recommendations and information of interest to&#13;
management;&#13;
(d) development and dissemination of details of accidents involving environmental damage or&#13;
potential damage, analyzing failures that occurred on transport systems, including risk&#13;
prevention and control;&#13;
(e) maintenance of an updated data base, and dissemination of information on federal, state,&#13;
and municipal environmental legislation, continuously verifying compliance with the&#13;
legislation through environmental audits;&#13;
(f) on the basis of an analysis of failures, development and promotion, with external entities,&#13;
of better procedures, techniques, equipment, training, etc., to enhance technical development&#13;
and operational and environmental safety;&#13;
(g) preparation of technical procedures, specifications, and standards; and&#13;
(h) through statistics,  analysis of failures and legislation, and technical improvement,&#13;
revision of the program, correction of distortions, and recommendations for remedial actions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                                 Annex 6&#13;
This program is consistent with Directive No. 23 of the Transport Sector Priority Environmental&#13;
Directives promulgated by GEIPOT.&#13;
C. Reorganization and Strengthening of RFFSA's Environmental Unit&#13;
(a) Reorganization&#13;
8.      The reorganization of the EMSU is necessary since rail operations will be carried out by the&#13;
future concessionaires, and the Transport Ministry plans to delegate its environmental and safety&#13;
supervision responsibilities to RFFSA.  RFFSA  will therefore be responsible for environmental&#13;
monitoring and control of all activities related to operations and investments, including reduction of&#13;
environmental liabilities. For this purpose, the unit will be reorganized as shown in the organization&#13;
chart below, and staffed with at least eight technicians who are academically qualified.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND&#13;
SAFETY MANAGEMENT UNIT&#13;
ACCIDENT RISK                 INSPECTION and CONTROL          ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY&#13;
SUB- UNIT                         SUB- UNIT                      SUB-UNIT&#13;
The environmental liability sub-unit will perform a transitional function; it will be closed when past&#13;
environmental damage is significantly reduced.&#13;
(b) Strengthening&#13;
9.      A training program was developed to strengthen the EMSU in the short and medium term.&#13;
The project would include funding for:&#13;
(a) the participation of at least two academically-qualified professionals (Masters/PhD&#13;
courses) in environmental planning at a Brazilian university;&#13;
(b) the participation of at least two professionals in technical courses or training programs&#13;
abroad, with emphasis on safety;&#13;
(c) the implementation of specialized courses and seminars with the assistance of specialized&#13;
firms and/or international organizations, for RFFSA staff.&#13;
The total cost of the training program is estimated at about US$250,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                                    Annex 6&#13;
D. Environmental Liability Settlement&#13;
10.     Since railway operations will be transferred from RFFSA to private concessionaires, it will&#13;
be necessary to identify existing environmental liabilities, and to specify the respective responsibilities&#13;
of RFFSA and the concessionaires for the existing and possible future liabilities under the concession&#13;
contracts.   In principle, RFFSA  would be responsible for the existing liabilities prior to the&#13;
concession, and the concessionaires would be responsible for all future damages.&#13;
11.     To this effect, the project would include a component for the identification and diagnosis of&#13;
environmental liabilities in the proposed six concessions. These environmental audits will cover the&#13;
following installations and operations: (i) 64 supply depots; (ii) 95 workshops; (iii) 10 wood-sleepers&#13;
treatment factories; (iv) depots and storage facilities; and (v)  free plantations.  The cost of the&#13;
environmental audits is estimated at US$700,000. The reduction of environmental liabilities, through&#13;
the recovery of destroyed areas/protection works, would be done by the concessionaires or RFFSA,&#13;
depending on the results of the negotiations of the concession contract.&#13;
E. Environmental and Operational Safety&#13;
12.     Environmental and operational safety mainly deals with: (a) handling dangerous products; (b)&#13;
urban rail crossings; and (c) level crossings.   The conditions under which dangerous goods are&#13;
transported will be analyzed on each route, considering the danger of  the cargo.  Operational&#13;
instructions will be established in each case, in order to comply with regulations. All the crossings&#13;
will be analyzed, and recommendations will be formulated to reduce the risks of accidents. The&#13;
EMSU will prepare safety regulations and instructions, and will supervise their implementation by the&#13;
concessionaires.&#13;
13.     In order to  incorporate international know-how  in this area, RFFSA  will exchange&#13;
professionals with railway operators or supervisory agencies such as the Federal Railroad&#13;
Administration in the USA, which investigates railway operators when accidents occur. The cost of&#13;
this component is estimated at US$ 200,000 equivalent.&#13;
14.     In order to fulfill the role of regulating and monitoring the environmental and safety aspects&#13;
of the concessionaires' operations, the EMSU will develop and establish a data base which will&#13;
provide information about traffic accidents (verification, statistics, cause analysis, possible solutions).&#13;
The project will include the purchase of hardware and software for this purpose, at an estimated cost of&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent.&#13;
F. Summary of Cost Estimates&#13;
15.     The estimated cost of the environmental management&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Regulatory Reform Component&#13;
A. Regulatory Policy&#13;
1.    In recognition of the critical importance of efficient transportation for national economic&#13;
growth and prosperity, the Government of Brazil is undertaking substantive steps to restructure its&#13;
railroad industry and to reform its public policy towards the sector. The government's basic premise&#13;
is that decentralized market-oriented decision-making that is freed from excessive regulatory control&#13;
and that is energized by commercial incentives is the surest means of finding and implementing&#13;
efficient and innovative solutions to problems posed by the country's transportation needs.&#13;
2.     One key element of the government's restructuring program is to move most rail activities&#13;
from governmental to private control in order to improve the incentives for internal efficiency, market&#13;
responsiveness and fiscal responsibility. Another key element of restructuring is to unleash market&#13;
forces of competition to the fullest extent that is consistent with economic efficiency and the public&#13;
interest. In this context, the government is undertaking significant regulatory reform initiatives and is&#13;
adopting a pro-competitive regulatory system which will permit firms to set independent prices at&#13;
levels that are based on demand conditions and that cover the firms' total costs when they operate&#13;
efficiently. Thus, to a much greater extent than in the past, market forces will shape the prices and&#13;
logistics of railroad services.&#13;
3.     Regulatory Commitment.  A necessary condition for effective restructuring and sustained&#13;
large-scale private investment in railroads is the country's institutional capacity to restrain arbitrary&#13;
administrative action and credibly commit to a stable regulatory regime. Indeed, one of the most&#13;
important lessons that has emerged from the experience of other countries is the need to establish a&#13;
well-defined regulatory regime as early as possible in the privatization process and to adhere to a&#13;
transparent and predictable process. This will reduce the risk premium demanded by investors and&#13;
enhance the government's ability to capture the benefits of privatization.&#13;
4.     The provision of many innovative and market-responsive rail services in Brazil will require&#13;
specific investment in infrastructure, such as upgrading of way and structure facilities, construction of&#13;
loading and transhipment facilities and building spurs of track to reach shippers' locations. These&#13;
infrastructure costs are largely sunk because the assets are of minimal value for other purposes.&#13;
Private railroads that are vulnerable to arbitrary administrative intervention can be expected to invest&#13;
less than the optimal amount. The government has a tight timetable in which to implement the&#13;
restructuring and privatization of RFFSA. Still, it is very important to make the effort and commit the&#13;
resources early on to establish a credible regulatory regime that contains substantive and procedural&#13;
constraints on arbitrary administrative action.&#13;
5.     Guiding Principles for Regulatory Reform. Two basic principles would guide the reform of&#13;
railroad regulation. The first is that the competitive market should serve as the model for regulation.&#13;
Regulatory restraints are to be imposed or continued only where market forces are insufficient to&#13;
enforce competitive behavior. In such cases, regulation should be used as a substitute for the forces of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                                    Annex 7&#13;
the market--to induce suppliers to behave as if competition had guided their actions. The second&#13;
guiding principle is that regulatory impediments to adequate revenues should be eliminated. This does&#13;
not mean that profitability will or should be guaranteed, only that carriers should be offered the&#13;
opportunity to obtain competitive earnings.  Indeed, in a regime of deregulation without general&#13;
subsidies, one of the key elements in protecting the public interest is the avoidance of any residual&#13;
regulation which effectively prevents the achievement of financial viability by the rail network.&#13;
Regulatory reform should, therefore, provide railroads with substantial flexibility in the areas of&#13;
pricing and industry structure.&#13;
6.     Revenue Adequacy and the Need for Demand-Differentiated Pricing.  Regulation should&#13;
not impede railroads from achieving revenue adequacy. Revenues are defined to be adequate when&#13;
they are sufficient to enable the firm to attract the capital needed for maintenance, replacement,&#13;
modernization and whatever expansion demand conditions justify; that is, they are sufficient to cover&#13;
the replacement cost of the services demanded by shippers. If revenues of unsubsidized railroads are&#13;
lower than this, the deterioration and eventual disappearance of the services in question are inevitable.&#13;
7.     For prices to make sense economically they must never be incompatible with revenue&#13;
adequacy--indeed this should be embedded as a statutory requirement within the regulatory framework.&#13;
Where the costs of the enterprise are characterized by substantial fixed and common components, as is&#13;
the case in railroading, the need to earn adequate revenues generally requires rates to differ&#13;
significantly and systematically from the marginal costs of the corresponding services.  Thus, it&#13;
becomes impractical, indeed unfeasible, to require rate setting to follow the maxim that each service of&#13;
the supplying firm should be priced at a level so as to equal its marginal cost, the cost caused by&#13;
supplying an additional unit of that service.&#13;
8.     If prices, then, cannot be made to equal marginal costs, the issue that faces the regulator is&#13;
what principles should be followed to determine the deviations between prices and marginal costs that&#13;
are required for the solvency of the supplying firms. Here the goal of economic efficiency should&#13;
serve as the primary guide. It implies that prices should, optimally, deviate from the corresponding&#13;
marginal costs in proportion to the "value of the service" in question -- that is, in inverse proportion to&#13;
the elasticity of demand for that service.&#13;
9.     The reason is that consumers whose demands are relatively inelastic are those who most&#13;
effectively resist the purchase disincentive provided by a rise in price relative to marginal cost, and&#13;
who will, consequently, behave in a manner that approximates most closely the way they would if rate&#13;
setting were to follow the unattainable ideal of marginal cost pricing. In other words, the efficient&#13;
pricing solution to the requirement of revenue adequacy apportions the burden of covering fixed and&#13;
common costs on the basis of demand, assigning prices in the way that minimizes the price&#13;
disincentives to optimal behavior by suppliers and purchasers.&#13;
10.    This Ramsey (demand-differentiated) solution to the optimal pricing problem has the advantage&#13;
of both common sense and rigorous economic analysis. It is the only rational solution to the revenue&#13;
adequacy problem and it is the principle that should be embedded in the Brazilian regulatory system.&#13;
Given the natural incentives for railroads to charge Ramsey prices, there is an assurance that these&#13;
optimal pricing principles will be applied in practice if the railroads are permitted to set their prices in&#13;
accordance with the market.&#13;
11.    The Proper Role For Regulatory Intervention. Regulation has two fundamental issues to&#13;
deal with if the public interest is to be protected. First, regulation should constrain the potential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                                     Annex 7&#13;
capacity of any carrier to preclude or impede any competition which satisfies the criterion of&#13;
efficiency. Second, even if all removable barriers to efficient competition have been eliminated,&#13;
regulation should prevent the exercise of any power on the part of the carrier derived from the natural&#13;
monopoly attributes of its activities, to extract excessive profits from shippers via prices which deviate&#13;
from efficient levels--power which cannot be eliminated by rules against anticompetitive behavior&#13;
because the carrier's ability to act this way is attributable to its natural monopoly characteristics.&#13;
12.    Maximum  Rate Reasonableness Standards--Constrained Market Pricing.  Towards those&#13;
elements of railroad activities in which competitive pressures are judged to be inadequate (that is, in&#13;
areas in which a railroad possesses market dominance or its shippers are captive) it is recommended&#13;
that a policy of "Constrained Market Pricing" (CMP) is adopted--i.e., the railroads should be permitted&#13;
to engage in Ramsey Pricing to achieve revenue sufficiency, and these Ramsey prices should be&#13;
constrained only by the overall revenue adequacy or the Stand Alone Cost (SAC) test, whichever is the&#13;
lower.&#13;
13.    Therefore, under the proposed CMP system: (a) ceilings on rates where there is market&#13;
dominance are established based on the SAC criterion--a shipper has a legitimate complaint of being&#13;
overcharged for services if and only if he can find a group of shippers of any products carried by the&#13;
railroad such that the amount they pay, plus the amount he pays, exceeds what they would have to pay&#13;
to an efficient entrant specializing in providing those services with no barriers to entry; alternatively, a&#13;
subset of prices charged by a railroad violates the SAC ceiling if any group of shippers who pay those&#13;
prices could be served at lower cost by a hypothetical entrant specializing in providing the services&#13;
purchased by the group; and (b) rate floors are designed to prevent cross-subsidies by reflecting the&#13;
same economic incremental costs that would set the floors on competitive rates.  In between these&#13;
floors and ceilings, railroads should be free to select their own rates based on their assessment of&#13;
market demand.&#13;
14.    Under this regulatory system, rail carriers' rates for the transportation of market dominant&#13;
traffic would be subject to three separate constraining factors. First, a shipper could not be charged&#13;
more than the stand-alone cost of providing service to it.  Second, a captive shipper would not be&#13;
required to bear the cost of demonstrated management inefficiencies in the carriers' operations and&#13;
pricing structure. Third, rate increases would generally only be permitted to the extent needed for the&#13;
carrier to reach and maintain revenue adequacy. CMP will, therefore, provide the necessary protection&#13;
for captive shippers, while providing railroads the opportunity to earn adequate revenues.&#13;
15.    Constrained Market Pricing is a practical and economically sound method of applying&#13;
competitive pricing principles to a regulatory framework. The objectives of CMP can be simply&#13;
stated. A captive shipper should not be required to pay more than is necessary for the carrier(s)&#13;
involved to earn adequate revenues. Nor should it pay more than is necessary for efficient service. A&#13;
captive shipper should not bear the costs of any facilities or services from which it derives no benefit.&#13;
Responsibility for payment for facilities or services which are shared (to its benefit) by other shippers&#13;
should be apportioned according to the demand elasticities of the various shippers. Thus railroads&#13;
would be given incentives to ensure that competitive traffic contributes as much as possible toward&#13;
these costs. Finally, changes in the rate structure should not be so precipitous as to cause severe&#13;
economic dislocations.&#13;
16.    Taken together, these constraints should ensure that a carrier does not use its market&#13;
dominance to charge its captive shippers more than they should have to pay for efficient rail service.&#13;
A shipper will not be asked to subsidize long-term excess capacity, fund revenue shortfalls which could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                                    Annex 7&#13;
be eliminated by pricing non-captive traffic at the full level demand would support, or bear the costs&#13;
associated with avoidable operating inefficiencies. Carriers will be effectively limited in the rates they&#13;
can charge on captive traffic and will have the necessary incentive to maximize the net revenue&#13;
contribution from competitive traffic. Cross-subsidization from other shippers is effectively precluded.&#13;
Therefore, the rate structure resulting from the interaction of market forces and the above constraints&#13;
is likely to produce rates that are economically efficient and fair to all shippers.&#13;
17.    The guidelines offer the flexibility to approach the rate analysis from various perspectives: (1)&#13;
the appropriate level and minimum cost of efficient service to the captive shipper (in the stand-alone&#13;
cost analysis);  (2) the appropriate level of carrier revenue needs (in the revenue adequacy&#13;
examination); (3) the other available means of meeting (or eliminating) those revenue needs (through&#13;
the scrutiny of the carrier's efficiency); and (4)  the public interest in minimizing economic&#13;
disruptions.&#13;
18.    Competitive Access. "Competitive access", including the regulatory prescription of rate and&#13;
service terms for joint-line rail movements, becomes an issue only when a market dominant carrier&#13;
controlling a "bottleneck" segment attempts to engage in a predatory price squeeze or refusal to deal&#13;
with a more efficient connecting carrier for the purpose of preventing the connecting carrier from&#13;
participating in the movement. Only in that circumstance would there ever be any justification for&#13;
regulatory intervention to require the bottleneck carrier to take steps that maintain or increase the&#13;
traffic handled by the connecting carrier. Such an intervention is never justified, however, to preserve&#13;
a market position that would otherwise be lost by a connecting carrier because joint-line service is less&#13;
efficient.&#13;
19.    The primary challenge for public policy is to set a level and structure of access prices which&#13;
promote dynamic efficiency through efficient entry and investment decisions while enabling the owner&#13;
of the network to remain financially solvent. The terms of access should not distort the process by&#13;
which prices are adapted to consumer preferences and demands for services.  Prices should be&#13;
sufficiently high to be compensatory (at least cover the long-run incremental cost of the use of the&#13;
network by the entrant), yet not so high as to preclude efficient operations by the entrant. Regulation&#13;
should, therefore, ensure that there is sufficient pressure on the owner of the infrastructure to operate&#13;
in an efficient manner, but that no unnecessary duplication of network construction takes place. At the&#13;
same time, the opportunities for competition to work effectively would be enhanced by the availability&#13;
on an unbundled and non-discriminatory basis of any basic network element, or any collection of&#13;
functions, that were needed by the entrant.&#13;
20.    Reciprocal switching agreements should be encouraged when they are practical and in the&#13;
public interest, or are necessary to provide competitive rail service--reciprocal switching could provide&#13;
shippers with an avenue of relief for inadequate railroad service. However, railroads should be&#13;
permitted to cancel joint rates and abrogate interswitching agreements when they can demonstrate that&#13;
such reciprocal arrangements are detrimental to their financial performance.&#13;
21.    Contract Rates.  Carriers should be permitted to negotiate shipper contracts with confidential&#13;
terms and conditions--railways and shippers should be permitted to enter into contracts which would&#13;
keep confidential the rates to be charged, the conditions relating to the traffic to be moved, and the&#13;
manner in which service obligations are to be fulfilled. The benefits of confidential contracts accrue to&#13;
both shippers and carriers. Shippers may negotiate for lower rates and for guarantee of a specified&#13;
level of service. Carriers may be able to improve the efficiency of their service since the contract&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -                                     Annex 7&#13;
should assure a predictable flow of traffic, and further foreclose of competition for its term. The&#13;
improved efficiency of resource utilization should also be beneficial to the economy at large.&#13;
22.    Structural Flexibility--Line Abandonments.  Public policy should recognize the need of the&#13;
Brazilian rail carriers to streamline their systems and, therefore, should facilitate the abandonment of&#13;
uneconomic lines. It is highly desirable that strict time limits are imposed on the line abandonment&#13;
process.&#13;
B. Implementation&#13;
23.    In practice,  regulation of the railway concessions has three main aspects:   (a) economic&#13;
regulation including tariffs, division of tariffs, and service or track abandonment;  (b) safety&#13;
regulation; and (c) monitoring and supervision of track condition.&#13;
(a) Economic Regulation&#13;
24.    Given Brazilian conditions in the transport sector, competition will be the best regulator and,&#13;
where adequate competition exists, regulation is generally not needed.  In addition, since the&#13;
competitors of railways are private and essentially unregulated, private operation and the lightest&#13;
possible regulation must be the basic model for railway concessions as well. Second, each concession&#13;
has unique market and service characteristics, which will determine terms and conditions under which&#13;
regulation should be formulated and administered. Specifically, subject to broad controls over anti-&#13;
monopolistic behavior, each concession will have different and appropriate terms governing regulations&#13;
over tariffs. Third, in general, the Government intends to restrict its role to the minimum actions&#13;
needed to protect the public interest and leave the concessionaires to operate as much like normal&#13;
businesses as is possible so that they can compete successfully with private trucking, pipeline and&#13;
water transport.&#13;
25.    In general, railway enterprises shall be free to set their prices and services (quality and&#13;
quantity) in such a way as to meet shipper needs and maximize the railway's total earnings. While this&#13;
approach (Ramsay Pricing) is known to produce a wide spread of relationships between prices and&#13;
costs of service, it also minimizes the total cost of transportation to the country. Tables or charts of&#13;
"Reference" or maximum rates shall generally be considered to establish those levels below which&#13;
tariffs are by definition reasonable and not subject to protest. DTF shall have the burden of adjusting&#13;
the reference tariffs to take into account changes in costs or other circumstances so that there will&#13;
always be a public indication of the target levels shown in the reference tariffs.&#13;
26.    The guiding principles will be subject to several exceptions:&#13;
(a)    prices below long-run variable costs (long-run variable costs are the costs&#13;
which change with respect to the traffic being priced) are predatory and are prohibited.&#13;
If challenged, the concessionaire will have the burden of showing that the proposed&#13;
tariffs are not below their variable costs.&#13;
(b)    contract tariffs (voluntary agreements between railway and shipper which&#13;
include volume guarantees, quality guarantees, or other services beyond normal&#13;
common carrier obligations for a single wagon load of freight) may be confidential and&#13;
are not subject to regulation except that they must be filed with DTF and are available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -                                    Annex 7&#13;
to DTF only for confidential use in case of shipper allegations of discriminatory&#13;
pricing. Contract tariffs may contain provisions for adjusting prices in accord with&#13;
conditions defined in the tariff. Contract tariffs are not governed by the reference&#13;
tariffs because they reflect special conditions not represented in the standard conditions&#13;
assumed in the reference tariffs.&#13;
(c)    arbitrary discrimination.  Price discrimination based on railway whim or&#13;
shipper identity and no other factors is prohibited.&#13;
(d)    protecting the "captive shipper". Under certain circumstances, such as lack&#13;
of adequate commodity source or transport competition as a result of location or&#13;
commodity characteristics, the shipper can be said to be "captive" to the railway.&#13;
Under these circumstances, and in the absence of a voluntary contract, and if the&#13;
reference tariff is inappropriately high because of the volume of traffic being offered&#13;
by the shipper, DTF may be asked to consider whether a railway tariff should be&#13;
prescribed. In general, when setting a maximum tariff for a captive shipper, DTF&#13;
should be guided by the principle of "stand-alone" costs; that is, what would it cost to&#13;
provide the services if the shipper (or shipper group) in question stood alone and did&#13;
not benefit from the economies and contributions of other shippers. In practice, stand-&#13;
alone cost can often be approximated by permitting a shipper (or shipper groups) to&#13;
operate their own trains and pay a trackage use fee to the concessionaire which covers&#13;
the long-run variable cost of their use of track and track capacity.&#13;
(e)    protecting the "captive railway". Where a single shipper, or consortium of&#13;
shippers, controls the railway, different possible abuses exist: (i) the tariffs for&#13;
shippers outside the consortium might be forced up in order to reduce tariffs for&#13;
consortium members; (ii) a dominant member of the consortium might attempt to force&#13;
its tariffs down at the expense of other members of the consortium, or;  (iii)&#13;
consortium members may focus on their traffic and ignore opportunities for new or&#13;
outside business. If the railway is dominated by a shipper/owner, DTF may ask: 1)&#13;
whether the railway's tariffs are generally high enough to permit adequate coverage of&#13;
operating, maintenance and capital expansion costs; if not, members of the consortium&#13;
should be required to pay higher tariffs;  2) whether the non-members of the&#13;
consortium are being charged tariffs which reflect arbitrary discrimination; if yes, then&#13;
their tariffs may be lowered to reasonable levels; 3) whether the tariff decisions of the&#13;
consortium are adequately insulated from the interests of a single investor; if not, DTF&#13;
may require that the consortium institute an agreement to ensure non-discriminatory&#13;
pricing among consortium members); or, 4) whether the consortium has organized the&#13;
railway in a way that will promote attention to non-consortium business possibilities.&#13;
The impact of many of these potential issues can be alleviated by a requirement that&#13;
shipper-owned consortia (if any) must insulate the business decisions of the railway&#13;
from the individual interests of the shippers; but this provision is difficult to enforce.&#13;
The following paragraphs provide an assessment of each of the proposed concessions with regard to&#13;
regulatory requirements.&#13;
27.    Centro-Leste, Sul, and Oeste.  Potential concessionaires will be given tables of maximum&#13;
"reference" rates, based on wagonload traffic moving various distances, and generally related to tariffs&#13;
in force today.  These tables will be different for each concession and for each of the major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                                   Annex 7&#13;
commodities. So long as a proposed tariff is below the appropriate level in the reference table, it will&#13;
not generally be subject to further review.&#13;
28.    Nordeste.  Bidding will commence subject to a table of reference rates. If, however, this&#13;
concession turns out to be a "negative concession" (i.e., the Government must pay to provide for its&#13;
operation), then the Government will reserve the right to intervene directly in tariffs in return for&#13;
appropriate modification in the fee to operate.&#13;
29.    Tubarao is a single shipper, single commodity carrier.  Either Eletrosul should be the&#13;
concessionaire, or it may want to assist in formation of a concessionaire, which would carry coal under&#13;
contract to Eletrosul: in this case no further tariff regulation would be needed. If Eletrosul does not&#13;
control the concessionaire, then a maximum tariff which permits the concessionaire to earn a&#13;
reasonable rate of return under efficient operation should be prescribed in advance before the&#13;
concession is put on offer. After this point, very little regulation appears necessary.&#13;
30.    Sudeste poses a unique challenge since such a large part of its traffic and revenues (over 80&#13;
percent of Ton-Km and 70 percent of its revenue) comes from a very limited number of iron ore, steel&#13;
and cement producers and shippers. Among these companies, about 75 percent of the traffic and 60&#13;
percent of the revenue come from a single iron ore producer (MBR). This poses several issues: 1)&#13;
would an MBR competitor be permitted to bid for and acquire a significant ownership position in this&#13;
concession, which could create the potential for competitive abuse in the shipment of iron ore from&#13;
Minas Gerais to the Atlantic ports? 2) will MBR and the other iron ore/steel companies be permitted to&#13;
form a consortium and bid for the concession as a group? If so, could the share of ownership of any&#13;
single owner be restricted? and 3) how could the tariffs for these "captive shippers" or their "captive&#13;
railway" be regulated?&#13;
31.   In many countries, including the US, railways are not permitted to haul their own commodities&#13;
in order to avoid the potential abuses discussed above. Using this approach, no shipper, including&#13;
CVRD and MBR, would be allowed to have a significant ownership share in the Sudeste concession.&#13;
If the concession owner is not a shipper consortium, then, along with a reference table of rates (of&#13;
which the iron and steel commodities will obviously be crucial and will justify great care in&#13;
preparation), the concessionaire could be required to permit any of the iron/steel shippers (or groups&#13;
thereof) to run their own private trains in return for a specified fee (per train-km, gross ton-km, or&#13;
other) defined at the outset of the concessioning process. This would cap the exercise of market power&#13;
and would constitute an approach to stand alone costing.&#13;
32.   If shipper groups are permitted to bid, then it appears desirable that no one shipper, (neither&#13;
CVRD nor MBR) have a controlling ownership share in the consortium, but either could well be a&#13;
minority member of the Sudeste concessionaire group. In this light, one acceptable outcome would be&#13;
for all of the iron/steel shippers (plus any others who are interested) to form a consortium to be one of&#13;
the bidding groups, with the group structured so that no shipper has a controlling position in the&#13;
concession. If the shipper consortium wins the concession, the issue of regulation would be relatively&#13;
simple: all iron and steel transport charges for each shipper should be made available to DTF (but not,&#13;
necessarily, to the public) and all differences in charges to each shipper should be readily justifiable to&#13;
DTF in terms of the volumes, costs and quality of services provided. In addition, it is possible that a&#13;
cement, steel and iron ore-dominated Sudeste consortium might be indifferent to developing&#13;
merchandise traffic along the Rio/Sepetiba/Sao Paulo line; in this case, one could consider breaking&#13;
Sudeste into two concessions, one specialized in iron ore and steel, and another focusing on&#13;
merchandise traffic to/from  Santos/Sao Paulo.  Alternatively, in cooperation with the FEPASA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -                                  Annex 7&#13;
concessioning, trackage rights could be given to the FEPASA broad gauge concessionaire to operate on&#13;
the line from Sao Paulo to Sepetiba and Rio.&#13;
33.   Two critical issues remain for resolution. First, under the current Real Plan, rail tariffs are&#13;
externally controlled by agencies not involved in railway concessioning: the new concessionaires will&#13;
have to be exempted from these price controls. Second, the reference tariffs must not be interpreted as&#13;
fixed numbers independent of changes in other values in the economy. Instead, the reference tariffs&#13;
should be understood as being stated in Reals as of the date of the signing of the concession. Proposed&#13;
new public tariffs would then be considered to be under the reference level if they are lower than the&#13;
reference levels when adjusted to the values pertaining as of the date of the concession contract.&#13;
34.   Divisions of Tariffs Among Concessionaires. There is very little traffic moving among or&#13;
between the proposed concessions -- in particular, Tubarao is physically isolated, and Nordeste is&#13;
effectively isolated by the distance. There may be significant potential for growth in traffic among the&#13;
new concessions and with FEPASA, CVRD, FERRONORTE AND FERROESTE. Thus, some&#13;
mechanism for setting tariffs for inter-concession traffic is needed in the case where the individual&#13;
concessionaires cannot agree on a joint tariff or the division between or among them.  Several&#13;
approaches are available: the best approach is that joint tariffs be a matter of negotiation among the&#13;
concessionaires involved and either FEPASA or CVRD. Concessionaires could be required by DTF to&#13;
establish joint tariffs at a level equal to or less than the sum of their individual concessions' reference&#13;
tariffs for the distance and commodity group involved. It is not clear whether there is, or needs to be,&#13;
a mechanism for imposing tariffs and divisions of tariffs on traffic interchanged with FEPASA or&#13;
CVRD.&#13;
35.    Trackage rights. The Government may also want to retain the right to prescribe trackage&#13;
rights, and charges therefor, for concessionaires to operate over the tracks of others in the event that&#13;
the growth of rail traffic is being impeded by the inability of concessionaires to establish joint rates and&#13;
deliver high quality coordinated services. This right might also be extended to existing, or even new,&#13;
concessionaires who wish to engage in long haul intermodal services. In any event, though, the&#13;
trackage rights should be restricted to point-to-point services involving major markets, and should not&#13;
necessarily be extended to cover all points along a rail line.&#13;
36.    Abandonment of Service or Trackage. In principle, the Government intends to require that&#13;
concessionaires provide a minimum level (or levels) of service over the network to be concessioned.&#13;
This minimum might be one train per day, or one train per week, or service on demand by a shipper,&#13;
or whatever else is appropriate to the Government's objectives. Action by a concessionaire which has&#13;
the effect of falling below the specified levels of service will require DTF permission, which will not&#13;
normally be granted unless the lines in question can be shown to be uneconomic and unless all&#13;
alternatives to service (tariff increases, contract operation by others, etc.) can be shown to be&#13;
unfeasible, and unless the losses on the line constitute an undue financial burden on the concessionaire.&#13;
In some cases such as a few lines on the Nordeste concession, the Govermnent may either transfer&#13;
certain uneconomic lines to local governments in advance of the concessioning, or may offer&#13;
concessionaires a choice at the outset as to whether or not certain lines will be operated by the&#13;
concessionaire.&#13;
(b) Safety Regulation&#13;
37.    The public welfare will require that the concessionaires operate safely. MT/DTF will delegate&#13;
the supervisors of safety regulations to RFFSA, which will inspect the operations of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                                  Annex 7&#13;
concessionaires to ensure that track and equipment are maintained adequately, and that safe operating&#13;
practices are followed. The project would include technical assistance and training of RFFSA staff for&#13;
this purpose (Annex 6).&#13;
(c) Supervision of Track Conditions&#13;
38.   The terms of the concessions will require that tracks be maintained to specified quality levels&#13;
throughout the life of the concession in order to ensure that, if the concession is not renewed, the&#13;
Government will receive a railway that is in adequate condition for a new concessionaire to operate.&#13;
This will require that RFFSA inspect the track at appropriate intervals to verify that the track is being&#13;
maintained in the conditions specified in the concession contracts.&#13;
C. The Regulatory Reform Component&#13;
39.    The  Regulatory Reform Component of the proposed project comprises the development,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the Brazilian railway regulation, reorganization of the railway regulatory&#13;
and supervisory agency (MT/DTF), and the establishment of a dispute settlement commission&#13;
(COFER). Considerable attention was dedicated to learn the lessons from the U.S.A. experience&#13;
(Staggers Act) and the Canadian experience (Freedom To Move) and to illustrate to the Brazilian&#13;
decision-makers the impact of well designed regulatory policies.&#13;
40.    The railway economic regulation is being redesigned to: (i) allow  the concessionaires&#13;
maximum freedom to set tariffs on services which face competition, including differentiating them to&#13;
account for individual shippers' needs, and entering into confidential contracts with shippers; (ii) limit&#13;
the role of the Government to constrain the tariffs which a concessionaire sets to captive shippers, over&#13;
whom the concessionaire has monopoly power, by the stand-alone costs of the shipper's service; (iii)&#13;
authorize abandonment of lines or services which are proved to be financially not viable; and (iv)&#13;
facilitate inter-concession traffic . The concession contracts would reflect the specific regulatory&#13;
requirements of each concession and their different market and service characteristics. Presidential&#13;
Decree No. 1852, issued on March 4, 1996, revised the 1985 rail transport regulation. The project&#13;
would include technical assistance and training of MT staff to help develop, implement, and monitor&#13;
the regulation. Because the Concession Law requires setting up maximum tariffs, concession contracts&#13;
would include such maximum tariff tables which, in practice, would not constrain the concessionaires'&#13;
freedom. However, agreement would be sought during loan negotiations that the Government will, by&#13;
a date to be determined, review the relevant legislation and regulations regarding rail transport tariffs,&#13;
and inform the Bank of the decision and implementation of any executed modifications; and develop&#13;
appropriate mechanisms, criteria, and guidelines to implement the captive shipper rate and the line&#13;
abandonment regulations prior to concessioning the Sudeste and Nordeste systems respectively&#13;
41.    The Transport Ministry's Department of Rail Transport (DTF) would be strengthened to&#13;
effectively implement the revised regulation and to supervise the concession contracts, with the&#13;
exception of the technical, environmental and safety-related aspects of such supervision, which would&#13;
be delegated to RFFSA.   An independent Rail Transport Commission (COFER), including&#13;
representatives from the concessionaires, shippers and from the Government, would be established to&#13;
resolve disputes between the concessionaires and the Government, and between shippers and the&#13;
concessionaires. The establishment of COFER was approved by the President through a temporary&#13;
executive measure (Medida Provisoria).&#13;
&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Financial Restructuring and Settlement Component&#13;
A. RFFSA's Debts&#13;
1.    During most of its history, RFFSA has generated negative returns on its operations. These&#13;
persistent operating losses reflect the pervasive organizational inefficiencies and low productivity, lack&#13;
of commercial freedom, lack of market-oriented management structures, failure to significantly rationalize&#13;
operations by exiting from uneconomic low-density lines and shedding excess labor, and continuing&#13;
government-imposed obligations that rendered the railroad uncompetitive in the face of the growing&#13;
sophistication of road transport. Since RFFSA did not generate sufficient revenues to meet its payment&#13;
obligations, RFFSA has been accumulating payment arrears which have been growing rapidly. RFFSA's&#13;
debt amounted to almost US$3.0 billion by the end of December 1995. The long term financial debts&#13;
are relatively small. The debt consists mainly of rapidly increasing short term liabilities to Governrment&#13;
entities and to the staff pension fund.&#13;
2.    Financial Debts. The long term debt was about US$360 million equivalent at the end of 1995,&#13;
including accumulated unpaid interest of about US$60 million equivalent. It consists mainly of the&#13;
outstanding balance of Bank loan No. 2563-BR, which helped finance the Federal Railway - Export&#13;
Corridor - Project, and of some outstanding debts with BNDES and foreign banks.&#13;
3.    Debts with the Staff Pension Fund. Almost all RFFSA employees, as well as many employees&#13;
of other railways, participate in the Railway Pension Fund (REFER). RFFSA has accumulated large&#13;
arrears with the Pension Fund, which totaled over US$360 million equivalent at the end of 1995. Since&#13;
it is an important objective of the proposed project to reduce the staff of RFFSA, in particular through&#13;
early retirement, the outstanding debts with REFER need to be urgently settled so that the fund can honor&#13;
the acquired pension rights of RFFSA employees.&#13;
4.    Debts with Government Entities. The debts with Government entities consist of accumulated&#13;
payment arrears, including interest on such arrears. These debts totaled about US$2.0 billion equivalent&#13;
at the end of 1995, and are increasing rapidly. The accumulated debt with the National Social Security&#13;
Institute (INSS) represents almost half of the total, with about US$950 million at the end of 1995. The&#13;
balance of the debt to Government entities represents unpaid taxes such as social contributions, including&#13;
the "Finsocial", FGTS, and PASEP social funds (about US$700 million equivalent), the ICMS tax (about&#13;
US$270 million), and the income tax (about US$110 million).&#13;
5.    Pending Actions. A number of legal actions by creditors or labor are still pending, which could&#13;
result into further liabilities.&#13;
B. RFFSA's Assets&#13;
6.    RFFSA's assets total about US$16 billion equivalent in accounting terms. The rail assets, which,&#13;
on the basis of a preliminary identification, are estimated at about US$12 billion equivalent, would be&#13;
leased to the concessionaires. The non-rail assets, which consists essentially of land and buildings which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                                   Annex 8&#13;
are not used for operational purposes any longer, are estimated at about US$4 billion in accounting terms.&#13;
RFFSA management, however, estimates the market value of the non-rail assets at only about US$1.0&#13;
billion.&#13;
7.     Most of the non-rail assets, however, cannot be sold in the short term due to lack of regularized&#13;
ownership documents and as a result of past judicial decisions on legal actions by creditors, mainly the&#13;
INSS. The project will include funds to contract a Real Estate Management (REM) firm, which, inter-&#13;
alia, will make a detailed assessment of the market value of the stock of non-rail assets, and will identify&#13;
the requirements to regularize the documentation.&#13;
C. Financial Restructuring and Settlement&#13;
8.     RFFSA will continue to own its rail assets, which will be leased to the concessionaires. RFFSA's&#13;
revenues from the leasing of rail assets and from any sale or lease of non-rail assets are to be used to&#13;
repay as much as possible of RFFSA's debts, and to guarantee against possible future labor and&#13;
environmental liabilities. However, no decision has yet been made by the Government regarding the&#13;
treatment of RFFSA's debts, nor regarding the financing of the residual public service obligations in the&#13;
Northeast, which could be funded either from RFFSA's revenues, by the National Treasury (against&#13;
revenues from the sale of the railway concessions), and/or by state and local governments. Some debts&#13;
to the Government could be settled by accounting means, since the Government has not generally made&#13;
the normalization payments to RFFSA for public service obligations. But other debts to Government&#13;
entities, including the debt to the National Social Security Institute (INSS), would have to be rescheduled.&#13;
9.     The Government undertook to develop a plan to restructure and to settle RFFSA's debts. The&#13;
plan, however, cannot be finalized until the first auctions are completed and until the assessment of and&#13;
the plan for the management and sale of non-rail assets are prepared (para 11). RFFSA has prepared a&#13;
tentative debt restructuring plan in order to develop a tentative financial forecast for the residual company&#13;
(Annex 9). The Government would be comrnmitted to complete the plan, including the terms and&#13;
conditions of the rescheduled debts and a revised financial forecast for the residual RFFSA, and to&#13;
forward it to the Bank for comments by a date to be determined, consistently with the timetables for&#13;
concessioning and for the market valuation of RFFSA's non-rail assets. However, the Government would&#13;
have to make an earlier decision regarding the rescheduling of RFFSA's debt with the INSS, in order to&#13;
enable RFFSA to initiate the sale of non-rail assets as soon as possible.&#13;
10.   In order to effectively manage and settle its debts within the plan to be determined by the&#13;
Government, RFFSA will establish a Settlement Division (SD) with appropriate terms of reference&#13;
(regimento interno), and transfer to this new division all responsibilities to manage and settle the&#13;
company's debts and labor liabilities, and to manage and sell its non-rail assets (Annex 11). The Head&#13;
of the SD would be accountable to meet the agreed asset sale and debt reduction targets (Table 2,&#13;
Annex 11). RFFSA will also enter into a contract with a specialized Real Estate Management firm&#13;
(REM) to help develop and implement a plan to manage and sell its non-rail assets. A portion of the&#13;
REM's remuneration would be subject to meeting the asset sale targets. The project would include funds&#13;
for the REM contract and for the purchase of the necessary computer hardware and software.&#13;
11.    The terms of reference for the REM  contract would include the following main tasks:&#13;
(a) classification of non-rail assets by type; (b) assessment of market value of the stock, on the basis of&#13;
sample assessments; (c) analysis of documentation and identification of requirements for regularization;&#13;
(d) definition of plan of action, including timetable and targets, in order to maximize revenues from the&#13;
sale of RFFSA's non-rail assets; (e) identification of assets which could be brought to sale rapidly, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                                   Annex 8&#13;
preparation for sale; (f) assistance to SD in the selection, contracting and supervision of real estate agents&#13;
to market the assets for sale; and (g) management and monitoring of the asset sale program. The&#13;
remuneration of the REM would be partly based on sales. The fixed part of the remuneration is&#13;
tentatively estimated at US$2.4 million equivalent.&#13;
12.    The present targets for sales of non-rail assets have been based on RFFSA management's present&#13;
estimates of their market value (Table 2, Annex 11). They would be revised as necessary on the basis&#13;
of the results of the REM's assessment and plan of action.&#13;

Financial Analysis&#13;
A - Proposed Concessions&#13;
(a) Introduction&#13;
1.    RFFSA has prepared financial forecasts for each of the proposed concession in order to assess&#13;
the financial viability of these concessions. BNDES is also preparing financial forecasts in order to&#13;
determine the minimum  price for each concession.  BNDES' forecasts, however, will remain&#13;
confidential until the publication of the concession bidding documents.&#13;
2.     RFFSA's forecasts, which are presented in the following paragraphs, are based on RFFSA's&#13;
estimates of the potential demand for rail transport which are sumnmarized in Annex 3, and on the&#13;
corresponding traffic projections which are presented in Table I hereafter. They are slightly different&#13;
from, and generally marginally higher than, BNDES' traffic forecasts. The difference, however,&#13;
would not affect the main conclusions of the analyses. RFFSA's forecasts also take into account the&#13;
impacts of the proposed staff retrenchment and emergency rehabilitation programs on the future&#13;
concessions' operational expenses and productivity. As it can be seen in the following sections, the&#13;
Oeste, Centro-Leste and Sul concessions could rapidly become profitable, as soon as 1997 or 1998.&#13;
The Sudeste concession will become increasingly profitable, while the Tubarao concession could&#13;
continue to be profitable. The forecast for the Nordeste concession shows that, in the short term, the&#13;
Government is likely to have to pay subsidies to the concessionaire in order to offer adequate railway&#13;
services and affordable prices.&#13;

(b) Oeste Concession&#13;
3.      Because of the need for fuels in the hinterlands, and the rapid growth of Brazil's agricultural&#13;
and mineral production for export, there is a strong growth potential for Oeste's traffic. The tariffs on&#13;
this type of traffic, particularly fuels, are relatively profitable. Also, Oeste is the most likely link with&#13;
the "Oriental" concession in Bolivia, a linkage which might generate significant traffic when the&#13;
Bolivian railway concession is in private operation. The traffic is expected to increase from about 2.0&#13;
billion ton-km in the recent years (1992-1995), to about 3.3 billion ton-km in year 2000. Assuming&#13;
that average revenue can be maintained at about R$25 per thousand ton-kin, the concession net results&#13;
should change from recent annual deficits of about R$20 million under RFFSA operation, to&#13;
substantial net income from 1998 onwards (Table 2).&#13;

(c) Centro-Leste Concession&#13;
4.      The Centro-Leste concession has perhaps the best potential for sharing in Brazil's industrial&#13;
growth, but it will lose petroleum traffic to a pipeline in the near future, which puts a cap on its near&#13;
term growth and profits. Nevertheless, it appears that, even after the loss of petroleum traffic is&#13;
assimilated, Centro-Leste will enjoy a well-diversified and relatively stable traffic mix. Total traffic is&#13;
expected to increase from 7 billion ton-km in recent years to about 9 billion ton-km by year 2000.&#13;
Assuming an average revenue of about R$32 per thousand ton-km (down from R$38 in 1994), the&#13;
concession could still generate a substantial net income as early as 1997-98.&#13;

(d) Sudeste Concession&#13;
5.      The proposed Sudeste concession carries over 52 percent of RFFSA's traffic on only 8 percent&#13;
of RFFSA's total track length. Further, over 80 percent of Sudeste's traffic (in ton-km) is driven by&#13;
iron ore and other steel industry inputs and products produced by a single iron ore company (MBR, 61&#13;
percent) and two steel companies (21 percent). Thus, at least the North-South route of Sudeste is&#13;
actually an integral part of the production process for these companies and is not actually a general&#13;
carrier like most of the other concessions. RFFSA reports have consistently shown Sudeste to be&#13;
profitable on a full cost basis. The future looks even more positive.   According to RFFSA's&#13;
projections, which take into account the most recent development plans of the industry, total traffic&#13;
should increase from about 20 billion ton-km in 1995 to about 30 billion ton-km by year 2000. With&#13;
the proposed staff reductions and rehabilitation of locomotives, the concession's profits should rapidly&#13;
increase as shown in Table 4 herewith.&#13;

(e) Sul Concession&#13;
6.      The Sul concession already has a broad mix of traffic, which is strongly rooted in the&#13;
agricultural sector, primarily in soybean exports, and in petroleum products. Sal, also, would be one&#13;
of the inimediate beneficiaries of the rail traffic which is developing as a result of the Mercosul trade&#13;
agreement. The Mesopotamico concession in Argentina and RFFSA's Sul system are already&#13;
developing international traffic from Argentina to Brazil, mostly on containers. RFFSA's forecasts&#13;
suggest a strong market for them. Overall, traffic is expected to increase from about 9 billion ton-km&#13;
in 1994-1995 to almost 12 billion by year 2000. The system, which has had substantial deficits under&#13;
RFFSA operation, should become profitable as early as 1997-98, after the completion of the staff&#13;
retrenchment and emergency rehabilitation programs (Table 5).&#13;

(f) Tubarao Concession&#13;
7.      The Tubarao concession is a single purpose (coal) carrier serving one customer (Eletrosul)&#13;
over a very short distance. It is not clear why Tubarao was ever included within the national railway&#13;
network, but its future is solely bound to the needs of one customer. In this case, the sole customer&#13;
may need to take an active position in the railway by owning the concession and either operating it&#13;
directly or contracting for its operation. Even though Tubarao has a relatively short length of haul, its&#13;
average tariff per ton-km is about two to three times that of the rest of RFFSA, so there is probably&#13;
considerable room for a new owner/operator to effect economies of operation and save money for&#13;
Eletrosul. The revenues and the profitability of the concession will obviously depend on the position&#13;
of Eletrosul.&#13;

(g) Nordeste Concession&#13;
8.      The Nordeste concession has by far the lowest traffic density and employee productivity of all&#13;
of the RFFSA concessions, and even RFFSA's financial forecasts do not suggest that Nordeste can be&#13;
profitable. While there may indeed be a possibility that Nordeste could be profitable if operated with&#13;
imaginative marketing and stringent cost controls as in Argentina or U.S. shortline railway, it seems&#13;
more likely that the high tariffs needed to be profitable in the private sector would be unacceptable in&#13;
the poorest region of the country. Therefore the Government (and/or state governments) may have to&#13;
pay a subsidy to ensure adequate service levels and quality at an affordable price. According to&#13;
RFFSA's projections, traffic would increase from a low 800 million ton-km to about 1. 1 billion ton-km&#13;
in year 2000 under private operation. With the staff retrenchment and emergency rehabilitation&#13;
programs completed, the operational deficit could be reduced from about R$50 million in 1994-95 to&#13;
less than R$20 million by year 2000 (Table 7). The Government would have to define an appropriate&#13;
model for the Nordeste concession, including the public service obligations which would be required&#13;
from the concessionaire and the mechanisms to ensure their appropriate funding.&#13;

B. Residual RFFSA&#13;
9.      RFFSA  has also  prepared  a financial forecast for the  residual RFFSA  company, after&#13;
operations have been transferred to the concessionaires. The forecast, however, is very tentative since:&#13;
(a) future revenues from the leases of rail assets will be determined at the auctions; (b) the estimated&#13;
future revenues from the sale of non-rail assets are based on very preliminary estimates of the asset&#13;
values; and (c) no decision has yet been made regarding the treatment of RFFSA's debts. After the&#13;
auctions for the main concessions have been completed, and the plan for the sale of non-rail assets has&#13;
been completed, the Government would make a decision regarding the treatment of RFFSA's debts,&#13;
and would present to the Bank a RFFSA financial restructuring and settlement plan including a revised&#13;
financial forecast.&#13;
10.    The main assumptions used by RFFSA  for the preparation of the tentative forecast are as&#13;
follows. Revenues from rail asset leases are based on BNDES' current minimum price estimates.&#13;
Revenues from the sale of non-rail assets are based on a tentative target of R$1.0 billion over 1996-&#13;
2000. The debts with the Government, essentially income tax and social contribution, would be dealt&#13;
through settlement of accounts, including RFFSA's credit on account of normalization payments for&#13;
Government-imposed public service obligations. The debts with Government entities such as INSS and&#13;
social funds and the ICMS tax arrears would be rescheduled over 20 years at 10% interest. The debt&#13;
with the Pension Fund (REFER) would be rescheduled over 10 years at the same 10% rate. No&#13;
provisions were made, however, for any possible future liabilities. Under these assumptions, and&#13;
with a R$150 million bridge loan in 1998, RFFSA could service its debts over 1996-2000 without&#13;
transfers from the National Treasury, and reduce its stock of debts from about R$3.0 billion at the end&#13;
of 1995 to about R$2.4 billion by year 2000 (Table 8).&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Economic Analysis&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.     The project's main objective is to increase the performance and efficiency of the federal&#13;
railways through: (a) restructuring and concessioning its operations; (b) re-training and re-deploying its&#13;
redundant staff to more productive activities; (c) emergency repairs of locomotives, wagons and tracks&#13;
to enable continued and safe operations during the restructuring and concessioning process; (d) re-&#13;
designing railway regulation; and (e) restructuring RFFSA's functions and finances to effectively&#13;
manage rail and non-rail assets and to settle debts and labor liabilities. The staff retrenchment and the&#13;
emergency repair and maintenance programs, which are the main components of the project, will have&#13;
a direct impact on reducing the railway's costs. A separate economic analysis was carried out for each&#13;
of these two programs (sections B and C). The overall reform project, however, including the other&#13;
programs of relatively minor costs, is expected to substantially increase the railways' competitiveness&#13;
vis-a-vis other modes of transport, particularly trucking, and the railways' share of transport, thereby&#13;
reducing the long run marginal cost of freight transport in Brazil's main corridors. The economic&#13;
analysis of the project overall is presented in section D.&#13;
B. Economic Analysis of Staff Retrenchment Program&#13;
(a) Methodology&#13;
2.     The economic (rather than financial) costs and benefits of the redundancy program are compared&#13;
as follows. The costs cover mainly the amount of the severance payment (early retirements and financial&#13;
incentives) and the training cost. There is no loss of service value to RFFSA since, by definition, the&#13;
workers declared redundant have zero marginal productivity. The benefits include the additional&#13;
contribution to the economy that the workers will be able to deliver by working where is there is a demand&#13;
for their services.&#13;
3.     The costs. The costs of the retrenchment program in each concession are given by the sum of&#13;
the net present value of:&#13;
(i) the marginal productivity value of RFFSA's retrenched employees, differentiated by year&#13;
(i), employee (j), and concession area (k) (R Rk )&#13;
(ii) the severance payments (si );&#13;
(iii) the early retirement payments (P  )&#13;
(iv) the training costs (Tijk ) .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87-                                   Annex 10&#13;
4.     Item (1) represents the value of the services not rendered by RFFSA because of the labor&#13;
reduction. Since the remaining personnel is sufficient to carry out current production levels of RFFSA,&#13;
the value of the marginal productivity of retrenched workers is assumed to be zero.&#13;
5.    Items (2) and (3) would not be labeled economic costs, in an environment without budget&#13;
constraints or price distortions. Assuming no subsidy and no government budget constraint, these&#13;
outlays would be considered income-efficient transfers to the redundant employees and would then not&#13;
be included as a cost in the analysis. But Brazil does have a budget constraint and a highly distorted&#13;
tax system which results in many price distortions.  These two terns were therefore included to&#13;
recognize the importance of the costs of public funds. The underlying assumption is that the shadow&#13;
price of public funds is 100% and that each dollar of public resources used to finance severance&#13;
payments or early retirement packages has an equivalent economic cost which needs to be taken into&#13;
account. This also contributes to the conservative estimates of the rate of return as the cost estimates&#13;
are an upper bound of the costs rather than a lower bound. These payments are differentiated by year&#13;
(i) and employee (j).&#13;
6.    Item (4), training costs, have an economic component attached as long as the training agency&#13;
(or firm) has an alternative use for its resources. In this case, the training will be provided by para-&#13;
statal agencies that are fully subsidized by the government. These agencies appear to operate far below&#13;
their service capacity limits. Nevertheless, the full cost of the training program was included. Training&#13;
costs were estimated at R$ 200 to 250 per employee for 40 days, and all redundant workers have been&#13;
included. Training is differentiated by year (i), employee (j), and subsystem (k).&#13;
7.     The pensions paid to normally retired employees are not included, since these costs would be&#13;
incurred anyway. Earlier payments of regular pension have not been included since they are small and&#13;
heir impact on the internal rate of return of the project would not be significant.&#13;
8.     The Benefits. The benefits of redundancy reduction in each year are given by:&#13;
(i) the marginal productivity value of each laid-off employee elsewhere in the economy&#13;
(Rijrmp );&#13;
(ii) the marginal productivity value of the foregone labor cost of RFFSA (LCk ).&#13;
9.     The marginal productivity value of the laid-off employee is the product of: (i) the probability&#13;
of the employee's engagement in another productive activity, which depends on the effectiveness of the&#13;
training which the employee receives, by (ii) the net income produced by such activity.  RE  is&#13;
influenced by attributes such as age, education, etc., of each employee (j), and the location (m) he is&#13;
likely to find an occupation (p). Region (m) may or may not be the same as where he previously&#13;
worked and occupation (p) is related to the employee's attributes and the training which he receives.&#13;
In some cases, the laid-off employee may get a job at the expense of someone else's job, and his net&#13;
income contribution may be zero. But since these cases are normally rare, their impact on the final&#13;
results would not be significant. Provision was made for these assumptions in the sensitivity analyses.&#13;
10.    The marginal productivity value of the foregone labor cost of RFFSA  represents the&#13;
opportunity cost of the outlays that will be saved by the program. These savings in labor costs can be&#13;
used in investments in railways needed to provide additional service capacity, as well as further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                                  Annex 10&#13;
improvements in the existing system. In the economic analysis of this specific program they are&#13;
estimated as equivalent to the foregone labor cost. In the economic analysis of the overall project, in&#13;
section D, the savings in labor costs are translated in terms of a reduction in the long-run marginal cost&#13;
of rail transport. That cost reduction is the main reason for the increased rail competitiveness which in&#13;
turn explains the improvement of the rail market share over trucking.&#13;
(b) Quantitative Assumptions&#13;
11.    The quantitative assumptions made in estimating the return to staff reductions are conservative;&#13;
in particular, it is assumed that not everyone will find a job. The probability of being re-employed&#13;
was computed on the basis of the time spent on the job and the average length of unemployment. Based&#13;
on the information available about the employment situation in the largest metropolitan areas, the&#13;
probability of finding a new job ranges from 0.64 in the Northeast and 0.81 in the Center to 0.83 in all&#13;
other concession areas. These are strong assumptions since the probability of finding a job within a&#13;
year is in fact essentially 100% in all regions except for the North-East where on average it takes 14&#13;
months to find a job. The main reason why unemployment duration is rather short is that prices adjust&#13;
to clear the labor market. This implies that unemployment goes down as prices go down. Those who&#13;
do not find a job at their previous wage have to accept a wage cut consistent with the average&#13;
probability of being employed. The reduction in wage depends on the region; wage is reduced to the&#13;
average salary in the region where a worker is declared redundant. This implies wage losses varying&#13;
from 10% in the South and Southeast to 30% in the North East and Tubarao regions (Table 1,&#13;
hereafter).&#13;
(c) Results&#13;
12.    The net present value (NPV) of the staff retrenchment program is estimated at US$606 million&#13;
for a 12% discount rate, and its internal economic rate of return (IERR) is estimated at 40%, under the&#13;
most realistic and conservative assumptions (Table 1, hereafter). In financial terms, the payback period&#13;
is estimated to be a highly significant 1.6 years. There are wide differences across regions. Excluding&#13;
the Central Administration, the region with the highest return is the South East (the NPV is estimated&#13;
at US$223 million and the IERR is estimated at 51%). This is the region where labor productivity is&#13;
the highest, and also where the opportunity cost of not using the labor force effectively is the highest.&#13;
The lowest rate of return (19%) is found in the North-East. In all other regions, these conservative&#13;
estimates suggest rates of return to the economy over 37%. Table 1 also shows the results of the&#13;
sensitivity tests made: (a) if salaries are assumed to be 10% less than expected, the estimated rate of&#13;
return would be reduced to 36%. On the other hand, (b) if the probability of finding a new job is&#13;
100%, the estimated rate of return of the program would be as much as 50%, and the minimum rate in&#13;
the North East would increase from 19% to 34%.&#13;
13.   In summary, the redundancy program has a clear social value, under the most pessimistic&#13;
assumptions. This social value does not stem from the fact that RFFSA's workers are laid-off, but&#13;
rather because the redundant workers can be better used in other sectors where the demand has been&#13;
identified, and from the specific efforts made to ensure that the quality of this labor force will be&#13;
enhanced in the process through training. It also releases scarce public resources for better targeted&#13;
and more effective uses including education, which is best completed earlier rather than through middle&#13;
life literacy programs.&#13;

C. Economic Analysis of Emergency Rehabilitation Program&#13;
14.      The Emergency Rehabilitation Program  (ERP) is divided into six components: (a) locomotive&#13;
rehabilitation aimed at increasing the availability of locomotives, thus increasing traffic and avoiding&#13;
the costs of locomotive failure; (b) wheel replacement on both locomotives and wagons to reduce&#13;
derailments; (c) conversion of freight wagons to container flat-wagons to capture traffic now growing&#13;
as a result of Mercosul development; (d) minimum repairs of trackage to maintain safe operation and&#13;
reduce derailments; (e) limited system investment primarily in signaling and remote switch control&#13;
needed to pennit planned manpower reductions to proceed; and, (f) investments needed to close and&#13;
consolidate rolling stock repair shops in order to meet manpower reduction targets and facilitate the&#13;
operations of the new concessionaires.&#13;
(a) Locomotive Rehabilitation&#13;
15.     As a result of shortage of capital and consequent neglected maintenance, only about 52 percent&#13;
of RFFSA's locomotive fleet is operative, and the locomotives in operation are highly prone to failure&#13;
en route. This imposes two costs on the system: traffic is refused because there are not enough&#13;
locomotives available to haul the traffic on offer, and operating costs are high because on-line failures&#13;
are far more expensive than preventive maintenance. The situation has become so difficult that there&#13;
would be little tractive power left to hand over to concessionaires, and the concession value will be&#13;
substantially reduced, if emergency repairs are not made. RFFSA identified 240 of their current fleet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                                     Annex 10&#13;
of 901 locomotives for emergency repair and rehabilitation, which would result in higher reliability&#13;
and availability for an estimated eight year period.&#13;
16.    The locomotive rehabilitation component has two main benefits:  (i) the avoided economic&#13;
costs of the locomotive failures; and (ii) the avoided increases of long-run marginal economic transport&#13;
costs for traffic which would shift from rail to trucks if the program was not implemented. The&#13;
average added cost to recover from a failure is about $1,500. This is a conservative figure and it&#13;
includes only labor costs necessary for the typical repairs. Long run marginal costs for rail transport&#13;
were extracted from RFFSA's most recent cost study and differentiated by region according to the&#13;
average length of the haul (see section D). Therefore these rail costs overestimate future rail costs that&#13;
will be incurred under private operation and underestimate the returns of this program, because of the&#13;
productivity improvements expected from the project. Trucking costs for truck load shipments were&#13;
estimated from a representative sample of firms operating in the truck-load segment. The trucking cost&#13;
function adopted is sensitive to both economies of density and the average length of the haul. The unit&#13;
costs calculations for each subsystem were made in the region of the cost function where the economies&#13;
of density are exhausted for the average length of the haul observed at each subsystem.&#13;

in traffic densities. The expected reductions in the railways' operating costs, which are expected from&#13;
the project, would further improve these results, and turn positive the NPV for the Nordeste&#13;
concession (see section D).&#13;
18.    The above results are quite robust with respect to variations in the key assumptions. The base&#13;
case estimated economic rate of return for the entire program is 43 %. A 20 percent reduction in the&#13;
estimated cost per locomotive failure reduces the rate of return to 40 percent. A 20 percent increase in&#13;
the rehabilitation cost per locomotive reduces the rate of return to about 27 percent. Under both&#13;
assumptions together, the rate of return would still be a satisfactory 25 percent.&#13;
(b) Wagon Repairs&#13;
19.    The wagon repair component consists of the replacement of 11,200 worn wagon wheels which&#13;
are causing excessive derailments, and about 2,400 locomotive wheels. Due to limited historical data,&#13;
RFFSA cannot distinguish between the consequences of locomotive derailments and wagon&#13;
derailments. It was assumed that they are all wagon derailment. This is a conservative assumption&#13;
since locomotive derailment is much more costly to repair than a wagon derailment. RFFSA records&#13;
indicate that derailments due to bad wheels cost around $2.7 million per year in lost operations and&#13;
added labor costs (taxes are negligible in this case). Assuming that these can be reduced by about 80&#13;
percent through replacing bad wheels, the wheel replacement program would have an economic rate of&#13;
return of 19 percent. Assuming that the derailment reduction would be 20 percent less than expected&#13;
would reduce the rate of return to 13 percent. An increase in the replacement cost of 20 percent would&#13;
reduce the rate of return to 14 percent.  Since the assumptions made are conservative, and in&#13;
particular, no allowances have been made for the higher cost of locomotive wheel faults, for the non-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -                                  Annex 10&#13;
operating costs of derailments such as human injury, environmental clean-up, or for lost cargo value,&#13;
there is good reason to conclude that the wheel replacement program would have an acceptable intemal&#13;
economic rate of return.&#13;
(c) Wagon Conversion&#13;
20.    As a result of the Mercosul Trade Agreement, trade between Brazil and Argentina is increasing&#13;
rapidly, especially in higher-value manufactured products. Transport alternatives for this trade are&#13;
truck or rail. Rail movement necessitates a change of gauge at the Brazil/Argentina border, since the&#13;
Argentine Mesopotamica Railway is standard gauge, and the Brazilian Sul system is meter gauge.&#13;
These two factors -- higher-value products needing better service and the change of gauge at the border&#13;
-- combine to encourage growth in rail-hauled containers if rail is to be competitive. In 1995, for&#13;
example, RFFSA's container traffic was growing at about 20 percent per year.&#13;
21.   In the long run, as traffic increases, the Sul concessionaire is likely to invest in specialized&#13;
equipment. RFFSA currently has available 300 flat wagons that can be converted rapidly for about&#13;
$10,000 per wagon. These wagons will be suitable in the short run, and will have a ten year life.&#13;
Discussions with one of the potential concessionaires for Sul confirm that the equipment would be&#13;
consistent with current plans and would be used as planned: on this basis, the value of the conversion&#13;
program would be reflected in the bids received.&#13;
22.    Assuming a relatively conservative wagon productivity of 540,000 ton-km per wagon annually&#13;
and a net economic benefit of R$0. 11 per ton-km, which was derived from the difference between rail&#13;
and trucking long run marginal cost , the wagon conversion component would yield a 60 percent rate&#13;
of return. The economic rate of return for the conversion program is robust. Assuming the net&#13;
benefits would be 20% less than expected, the component would still yield a rate of return of 48&#13;
percent. A 20 percent increase in the conversion cost would reduce the rate of return to 50 percent.&#13;
Under both assumptions together, the component would still yield a high rate of return of 39 percent.&#13;
(d) Track Repairs&#13;
23.    Shortage of capital has deferred the maintenance of track and infrastructure, resulting into&#13;
increased derailments and safety risks, especially in areas where RFFSA carries hazardous cargoes.&#13;
Since RFFSA's traffic mix in many of the regions is weighted toward petroleum products, there are&#13;
many points at which a safety risk exists. An immediate program of rehabilitation is needed on the&#13;
parts of the network which carry higher density traffic and are thus exposed to higher risks of&#13;
derailment. Because it is basic work aimed at the higher priority parts of the network, the maintenance&#13;
work will be needed no matter who is operating the tracks.  Further, as the Government remains the&#13;
owner of the track and structures, the value of the work accrues to the Government both in asset&#13;
ownership and in the value of the bids received for the concession.&#13;
24.    The estimates of quantities of sleepers, rail and      Table 3-Track Repair Quantities&#13;
ballast to be substituted, based on completed engineering          (in thousand units)&#13;
designs, are shown in Table 3 herewith. In addition, the             Sleepers  Rail    Ballast&#13;

about $23.3 million.                                  Sudeste       77        .3      3&#13;
Sul           26       3.2     20&#13;
25.    The benefits to be derived from the track repair  Total       195      6.5     55&#13;
component are the reduced derailments of trains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                                 Annex 10&#13;
RFFSA statistics show that 48 percent of the derailments are attributed to tracks. It was assumed&#13;
conservatively that the proposed track repairs would reduce the costs of such derailments by 15%. On&#13;
this basis, the IERR was estimated at 19%. If benefits were 20% lower than expected, the IERR&#13;
would be about 13%. If costs were 20% higher than expected, the IERR would be 14%. There are&#13;
other important benefits such as improved human safety and reduced environmental risks, but they are&#13;
not easily quantifiable. There is no question that the investment is needed if the lines are to continue&#13;
in service, whoever operates them, and the value will accrue to the Government.&#13;
(e) Signaling and Telecommunications Systems&#13;
26.    Signaling and telecommunications investments comprise primarily automation of control of&#13;
remote switches which now requires independent staff. This component, estimated at about US$6.5&#13;
million, would reduce operating costs and increase the railways safety and reliability. The investment&#13;
is necessary to support the already committed manpower reduction program, and will be needed by the&#13;
concessionaires. No rate of return for the component has been calculated because it is considered a&#13;
necessary investment under the Staff Retrenchment Program. The operating cost savings in manpower&#13;
alone, which would be made possible by the proposed signaling investments, are in excess of US$9&#13;
million annually. These costs will be recovered by RFFSA before concessioning in most cases and&#13;
will accrue to the Government as owner and in the value of the bids received.&#13;
(f) Maintenance Facility Relocation&#13;
27.    RFFSA has far too many maintenance shops scattered over the system. The concessioning&#13;
program will require to consolidate some facilities in order to free unnecessary property for sale. In&#13;
many cases, since RFFSA shops are in urban areas, the closing of the shops will make the land&#13;
available for other uses. The component consists of relocating equipment from and close about 42&#13;
facilities which range from small, general purpose facilities to larger rolling stock shops, including:&#13;
15 in Nordeste; 14 in Centro-Leste; 5 in Sudeste ; 8 in Sul/Tubarao. Its cost is estimated at about&#13;
US$6.5 million.&#13;
28.    Because this component is also considered a necessary investment under the Staff Retrenchment&#13;
Program, no specific rate of return is calculated in this section. Shop relocation is an important part of&#13;
RFFSA consolidation in support of concessioning, and labor savings alone would repay the investment&#13;
in the first year. In addition, the value added through subsequent real estate development would easily&#13;
exceed the cost of relocation and consolidation.&#13;
D. Economic Analysis of Overall Project&#13;
(a) Methodology&#13;
29.   The main benefit of the overall project would be the reduction in the total transport costs which&#13;
can be achieved through the expansion of rail services. This expansion is likely to come not only from&#13;
the natural growth of today's traditional rail markets, but also from the increased rail market share in&#13;
inter-regional trade flows. Interstate commerce is estimated at about 200 million tons at an average&#13;
distance of over 1,100 kilometers. Inter-regional flows along rail trunk lines exceed 77 million tons&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                                          Annex 10&#13;
with an average haul of 1,500 kilometers.' The railways' market shares in these flows are currently&#13;
negligible, trucking being the dominant mode. However, the comparative advantage of rail technology&#13;
over trucking is quite sensitive to the length of the haul. At distances above 500 kilometers, rail cost&#13;
and service advantages in freight transportation are far superior to trucking.&#13;
30.     The macroeconomic benefits of the proposed project were estimated on the basis of the&#13;
projected rail traffic of the six regional systems, as estimated by BNDES in order to establish&#13;
minimum bidding prices for the concessions. The benefits of the proposed project would be derived&#13;
from: (a) the reduction in rail costs resulting from the expected improvements in rail productivity; and&#13;
(b) the difference in the long run marginal costs of the railway and trucks for the traffic which is&#13;
expected to be diverted from trucks to the railways. The improvements in rail productivity will&#13;
enhance rail competitiveness with respect to trucking, allowing it to attract more shipments. But these&#13;
improvements will also reduce the costs of hauling the existing traffic, making an additional&#13;
contribution to the overall benefits of the project.&#13;
(b) Traffic Projections&#13;
31.     The projections of rail traffic flows by region, show that the total production of the six RFFSA&#13;
systems would amount to 64 billion net ton-km by 2003 (i.e., the sixth year of operation after&#13;
concessioning), representing a 25 billion ton-km increase from the current production of approximately&#13;
39 billion net ton-km. This growth would represent about 13% of the projected inter-regional trade,&#13;
which is estimated at 152 billion net ton-km, assuming a 4% growth of both the economy and of&#13;
RFFSA's traditional markets. Traffic projections for the six subsystems are presented in Table 4&#13;
hereafter.&#13;

(c) Transport Costs and Benefits&#13;
32.     In 1994, RFFSA developed a detailed assessment of its operational cost management system,&#13;
and of the cost structures of its competing  modes.   The study, financed under the institutional&#13;
component of Loan No. 2563-BR, was aimed at enhancing RFFSA's strategic marketing planning.2&#13;
1. These estimates are based on the results of a multiregional input-output model developed for Brazil (Castro, N.&#13;
"Intramodalidade, intermodalidade e o transporte de longa distancia no Brasil", IPEA, Texto para Discussao 357.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                                        Annex 10&#13;
The rail and truck cost estimates which were derived and are shown in the final report of the study&#13;
were used as a basis for this analysis.&#13;
33.    Rail marginal costs were estimated on the basis of RFFSA's operational cost figures for the&#13;
period 1991-93. These costs include all operational outlays, maintenance of rolling stock, equipment&#13;
and infrastructure, and depreciation of rolling stock and equipment. The labor component of rail long-&#13;
run marginal costs (LRMC rail) was adjusted assuming that the private concessionaire would operate&#13;
with the labor force as determined by RFFSA for the Staff Retrenchment Program. Thus, the average&#13;
productivity gains permitted by the program are incorporated in the projected rail cost estimates. On&#13;
the other hand, it is also assumed that the railways' real average wages for the remaining employees&#13;
would increase by 30% after privatization. These assumptions combined result in a 20% average&#13;
decrease in the long-run marginal costs of rail transport. As the original data was available for each of&#13;
RFFSA's 12 production departments, the estimates for each concession were obtained as net ton-km&#13;
weighted average of the respective departments. RFFSA's average productivity of that recent period&#13;
was conservatively projected for the lifetime of the program. Table 5 hereafter shows both present and&#13;
projected rail long-run marginal costs.&#13;

freight. These&#13;
costs do not include road wear and environmental impact costs. The trucking cost function adopted is&#13;
sensitive to both economies of density and the average length of haul. The unit costs calculations for&#13;
each subsystem were made at the productive level of the cost function where the economies of density&#13;
were exhausted for the average length of the haul observed at each subsystem. The resulting costs for&#13;
trucking (LRMC truck) are shown in Table 3 for the six regional systems. Marginal costs of trucking&#13;
are differentiated by region according to the average length of haul.&#13;
(d) Investment Costs&#13;
35.    The project economic cost, including all components but excluding taxes and contingencies, is&#13;
estimated at about US$570 million (Table 6 hereafter). None of the additional benefits identified in&#13;
the economic analysis of the project components were considered. All payments made under the Staff&#13;
Retrenchment Program were included in the totalization of the program's cost. The distribution of the&#13;
costs by region and component is presented in Table 6 hereafter.&#13;

(e) Results of Base Case Analysis&#13;
36.     The net present value of the project is estimated at about US$2.4           Table 7-Base Case Results&#13;
billion for a 12%  discount rate, and its internal economic rate of return                      IRR      NPV&#13;
(IERR) is estimated  at a high  68%  under the base case (rail costs   Nordeste                 (2)  (US2 in)&#13;
incorporating productivity gains and demands as shown in Table 4). The   Centro-leste            68      652&#13;
net present value varies from about US$2.7 to US$1.9 billion for discount   Sudeste             107      1198&#13;
rates ranging  from  10%  to  15%, respectively.   The IERRs for the   Sul                       55      404&#13;
concessions are all above 20%, the lowest rate being  found  in the   Ocste                     101       141&#13;
Nordeste. In the important concessions of Centro-leste, Sudeste, Sul and   Total                 68      2435&#13;
Oeste, rates of return are above 50%. (Table 7).&#13;
(f) Risk Analysis&#13;
37.     The project would be subject to three major types of risks, as described in the first part of this&#13;
report (stemming from institutional, implementation and regulatory problems). All three types of risks&#13;
would materialize mainly into delays in both the privatization process and in reaching the projected&#13;
levels of rail production. The impacts of such circumstances have been examined in the sensitivity&#13;
analysis above. The results show that even in the most extreme and very unlikely case of complete&#13;
stagnation of rail traffic, the internal economic rate of return is an acceptable 13%. This result is&#13;
obtained, including all the costs of the Emergency Rehabilitation Program, and none of its benefits.&#13;
All the disbursements of the Staff Retrenchment Program were also considered in these calculations&#13;
and none of the benefits identified in section B. In financial terms, this latter program guarantees an&#13;
exceptional return for the project in any case.&#13;
38.     A first sensitivity test on the results above assumed that rail costs will not be reduced by the&#13;
project. Using the conservative rail cost estimates shown in Table 3, the project's internal rate of&#13;
return falls to 49%. Only in the North-East region does the return fall below 10%. A second test was&#13;
performed assuming that demand levels would be 20% below the projected figures in the base case for&#13;
2003. The overall rate of return, in this case, falls to 45%, but the results by region are all above&#13;
14%. The reduction in demand penalizes less the benefits attributed to the North East concession,&#13;
because the demand growth projected for that region are relatively more modest. A sensitivity analysis&#13;
made on both trucking costs (-20%) and investment costs (+20%) showed that the economic results of&#13;
the project are quite robust with an overall internal rate of return of 50%. An extreme case for the&#13;
evolution of the demand for rail services assumed zero growth for the entire planning horizon. The&#13;
only benefits in this case would be the reduction in rail costs permitted by the Staff Retrenchment&#13;
Program only on the existing traffic (but including the costs of all other programs). The overall&#13;
project internal rate of return in this case would still be a satisfactory 13%. The switching value for&#13;
the traffic growth assumption, which would zero the NPV, is therefore a slightly negative growth.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
FEDERAL RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Monitoring and Supervision Plan&#13;
1.    In order to effectively manage the implementation of the project, RFFSA has established a Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) and will contract project management assistance from a specialized Project&#13;
Management firm (PM). RFFSA, during project preparation, has started to develop and establish an&#13;
appropriate computerized project management system (CPMS) to monitor the implementation of the&#13;
project, including producing adequate information to report to RFFSA management, the Government, and&#13;
to the Bank. RFFSA will finalize the system and, on the basis of the CPMS, prepare and forward&#13;
quarterly progress reports to the Bank, not later than one month after the end of each quarter.&#13;
2.      The Bank will supervise and monitor the implementation of the project in accordance with the&#13;
Plan presented on the next page. In the course of project implementation, the Bank will in particular&#13;
review and approve: (a) disbursement applications for severance payments, on a sample basis; (b) all&#13;
procurement documentation for contracts for goods, services and civil works at or above the prior review&#13;
thresholds; (c) the terms of reference, invitation letters, short-lists and draft contract for consultant&#13;
services; and (d) the quarterly progress reports. In addition, substantial Bank input will be needed during&#13;
the first two years of the project in order to: (e) closely supervise and monitor the implementation of the&#13;
staff retrenchment program, in order to derive lessons for future reform operations; and (f) provide&#13;
guidance on the development, monitoring and evaluation of the regulatory aspects of the concessions, in&#13;
particular for the Sudeste and the Nordeste concessions. The estimates of Bank supervision inputs into&#13;
key activities, which are shown in the table of this annex, take into consideration the expected support&#13;
needed by RFFSA and the Government to effectively implement the project.&#13;
3.     The Bank will monitor the implementation and the impacts of the project against the agreed&#13;
project implementation plan (PIP), including the implementation timeschedule, the procurement timetable&#13;
and the set of implementation and development objective indicators which are set forth in the PIP&#13;
(Annex 11). Detailed reviews of the implementation of the project would be carried out in June each year&#13;
during project implementation and when 50% of the loan amount allocated to separation grants has been&#13;
disbursed. The reviews would cover all the agreed actions, target dates, and implementation indicators&#13;
included in the PIP and the status of compliance with all covenants of the Loan and Project Agreements.&#13;
Particular importance would be given to: (a) progress in the restructuring and concessioning process;&#13;
(b) staff reductions, re-training and outplacement assistance; (c) progress under the emergency&#13;
rehabilitation program and the environmental management component; and (d) progress under the&#13;
financial restructuring and settlement program, including achievement of targets for sale of non-rail assets&#13;
and reduction of debt. The Bank would have the right to exercise appropriate remedies if performance&#13;
is not satisfactory.&#13;

            Brazil - Federal Railways Restructuring and
            Privatization Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Federal Railways Restructuring and
            Privatization Project aims to reduce the cost of freight
            transport in Brazil's main corridors by restructuring
            and privatizing the federal railways. Specific objectives
            are to: 1) improve performance by restructuring and
            concessioning Rede Ferroviara Federal S.A.'s (RFFSA)
            operations to private operators, and by restructuring its
            finances to settle debts and labor liabilities; 2) increase
            productivity through staff retrenchment and emergency
            rehabilitation of critical assets in order to make the
            proposed concessions viable, while minimizing the social
            cost of staff retrenchment; and 3) enhance competition
            through regulatory reform, with a view to increase the
            railways market share and reduce freight transport rates.
            The project will consist of the following six components: 1)
            operations restructuring and concessioning component; 2)
            staff retrenchment program; 3) emergency rehabilitation
            program; 4) environmental management component; 5)
            regulatory reform component; and 6) financial restructuring
            and settlement component.
