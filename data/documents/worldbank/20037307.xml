This paper has been prepared as part of a broader study to understand the&#13;

            Drivers of crime and violence in Papua New Guinea
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Reports in both the national and
            international media and anecdotal evidence indicate that the
            prevalence of crime and violence is high in PNG, and
            presents an important obstacle to long-term development. A
            growing body of literature and data on the issue identify a
            diverse range of forms of crime and violence; from violence
            in the household to violent conflict between clans, and
            various forms of interpersonal violence. This violence has
            been linked to various factors, ranging from historical and
            cultural factors, to, more recently, economic drivers.
            Conflict and violence have historically been an integral
            part of social life in PNG. This briefing note presents an
            analysis of the drivers of violence and crime in PNG. An
            extensive data and literature review was undertaken by a
            World Bank team, following a scoping mission to PNG in
            December 2011. A follow-up mission to Port Moresby in
            October 2012 which included individual consultations with
            stakeholders as well as an experts meeting on Conflict and
            Fragility helped test and refine the analysis. The brief
            begins with a description of the role of conflict in PNG
            society, and of traditional mechanisms for managing
            conflict. Next, it discusses key stresses that increase the
            risk of violence in PNG. The fourth section examines how
            these stresses affect the capacity of institutions in PNG to
            manage the conflicts that come with rapid social and
            economic changes. The brief concludes with a summary of gaps
            in the current understanding of the stresses and drivers of
            violence in PNG.
