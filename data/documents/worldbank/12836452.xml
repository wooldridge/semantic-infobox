   BOX 1: OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF RURAL CREDIT FOR SANITATION IN VIETNAM&#13;
   Credit to finance sanitation with a favorable interest rate (0.5%/month) is available for rural populations under&#13;
   Decision No.62/2004QÐ-TTg by the Prime Minister. The portfolio of sanitation and water loans of the Viet-&#13;
   nam Bank for Social Policy is 7% (Folkard 2009a). Beside bank loans, people take loans from relatives and&#13;
   friends, buy on credit, and borrow from moneylenders. Moneylenders charge very high interest rates. How-&#13;
   ever, the monthly interest from various social banks (0.5­2%) is too low to cover the costs. As a result, the&#13;
   loan funds are not self-sustainable and services cannot be expanded to new clients without extra capital&#13;
   injections. Other restricting factors are high bureaucratic requirements and transaction costs, loan management&#13;
   problems in the institutions, and preference of users to take loans for productive, rather than consumptive use&#13;
   (Tran undated).&#13;
   In a study on water and sanitation loans taken by 12 rural communes in each of three provinces from the&#13;
   Vietnam Bank for Social Policy, about half of the loan takers had an income below the national poverty line.&#13;
   However, those in the lowest income bracket (&lt;200,000 VND per capita/month) were underrepresented.&#13;
   Furthermore, the researchers found that the willingness to take a latrine loan at an interest rate covering the&#13;
   real costs fell with increasing loan size. Based on extrapolation, over 7.4 million rural households were&#13;
   estimated to be interested in a loan of one million VND (56 USD) and 78% were ready to pay the real interest&#13;
   costs of 2.9%. This dropped to 2.7 million households and a 28% willingness to pay a real interest rate when&#13;
   the loan value increased to four million VND (225 USD).&#13;
   Many households also took a combined loan for sanitation and water supply up to the maximum of 8 million&#13;
   VND. The average amount of such a loan was 6 million VND. This amount and the duration of the loans were&#13;
   twice what was planned and budgeted, which further decreased the sustainability of the loan fund. It was also&#13;
   fairly common that households diverted part of their toilet loan to other uses (Folkard 2009a).&#13;

Because of the slower increase in rural sanitation, a pilot&#13;
project was therefore started in two provinces to test if a&#13;
rural sanitation marketing approach could enhance access&#13;

IDE, or International Development Enterprises, is a non-&#13;
profit organization, which uses business principles and un-&#13;
subsidized markets to help poor rural households sell their&#13;
products and services better, and so reduce their poverty.&#13;
IDE has been active in Vietnam since 1991. The Vietnam&#13;
branch has six offices and 30 staff members.                                       IDE undertook four major activities:&#13;

     generalized for the whole country. At the same time, the&#13;
     study sample can be taken as a cross-section for the whole&#13;
     pilot project area because of the balance between com-&#13;
     munes and districts with better and less good sanitation&#13;
     program indicators. Thus, while the findings are not repre-&#13;
     sentative for the country, they can be considered representa-&#13;
     tive for the pilot project.&#13;
&#13;
     Another factor with a potential effect on the representative-&#13;
     ness of the findings was that the study did not include in-&#13;
     terviews with providers who had taken part in the pilot&#13;
     project, but had stopped working in sanitation since the&#13;
     project ended. However, no evidence of such dropping out&#13;
     was found. Both promoters and providers were asked if they&#13;
     knew about any people who had stopped. This was not the&#13;
     case in any commune, and 14 of the 23 promoters said that&#13;
     only new providers had come.&#13;
&#13;
     Reliability. It should be taken into account that when asking&#13;
     the participants about their experiences and motivations, a&#13;
     period of between three and six years has passed between&#13;
     their participation in pilot project and the time of the inter-&#13;
     view. This passage of time may have influenced the accuracy&#13;
     of the information and the reliability of the findings. A fur-&#13;
     ther shortcoming was that the interview and FGD sched-&#13;
     ules were not pre-tested. With hindsight, the pre-tests, but                      it has been explained in the text. A final limitation was the&#13;
     especially the analysis of their results, could have led to                       lack of data on % access to toilets in the two comparative&#13;

     Data availability. A major limitation to the study was the                        Before the study could start, the local authorities had to be&#13;
     limited availability of project records: due to a computer                        informed about the purpose and nature of the study. This&#13;

     a good balance between price and quality, and (iii) giving                         providers themselves said that they too preferred septic&#13;
     price discounts during sales:                                                      tanks over the other models, giving the following reasons:&#13;
         · "I buy many suitable goods." (Provider #24)                                      · Greater cleanliness (11 providers)&#13;
         · "I look for hand basins with prices and colors that                              · Higher demand (nine providers)&#13;
            local people like." (Provider #21)                                              · Greater profit margin (four providers)&#13;

            ing basin instead of porcelain." (Provider #5)                              Provider #23 worded this preference this way, "It [the septic&#13;

            pocket." (Provider #28)                                                     and it does not affect the environment" [sic].&#13;
&#13;
     Two-thirds of the providers said that two years after the                          All interviewed providers said that they installed the pit&#13;
     pilot they continued to follow market developments, espe-                          models or sold the materials for them mainly because of the&#13;

     5.3 Types of Toilets Sold and Installed&#13;
     Of the four types of sanitary toilets promoted and installed&#13;
     under the pilot project, the providers said that the septic-tank&#13;
     model was sold and installed still more frequently today:&#13;
        · "At present, people only choose this type." (Provider&#13;
            #27)&#13;
        · "Households with resources want to build sep-&#13;

&#13;
Two shopkeepers (Providers #16 and #28) further reported&#13;
a trend towards the sitting-type toilet. This type is especially&#13;
preferred by the better-off customers.&#13;
&#13;
5.4 Gender Roles&#13;
All providers stressed that in sales and construction they&#13;
followed the wishes of the customers. According to their&#13;
experiences, men generally wanted to build bigger: "They&#13;
build big, nice, and monumental [toilets]." (Provider # 22)&#13;
                                                                                       FIGURE 22: NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WHO REPORTED&#13;

According to those interviewed, the networks are important,                        (Provider #21)&#13;
because they make it easy to refer customers to other network&#13;
members and, if so desired, give a one-stop service, that is,                      Figure 23 also gives an overview of the kind of credit pro-&#13;

Working in groups already existed before the pilot, but the                        down payment (seven and six cases respectively) and by&#13;
project enhanced the mechanism:                                                    payment after delivery (seven cases). Those accepting down&#13;

sellers of ceramic wares and producers of septic tank rings.      "within one month" (one provider) to one to two months&#13;
Network members mostly refer customers to other members           (two providers), and three months (one provider), while&#13;
or provide services and goods as a package. Those interviewed&#13;
stated that networks were an important means of&#13;
getting business. Half of the masons interviewed          FIGURE 23: NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WHO REPORTED PROVIDING&#13;

However, in Hau Loc, which has the largest net-&#13;

This confirms the other findings that sanitation                          without down payment,                                         down payment and with&#13;

        BOX 5: RURAL SANITATION MARKETING PROVIDES CAREER OPPORTUNITY: FROM FARMER TO ENTREPRENEUR&#13;
        The first mason had been a farmer until 1997. In 1999 he began selling building materials. Until 2003 he only sold&#13;
        cement, bricks, and iron and steel bars. In 2003 the pilot project trained him to sell sanitary goods. Since then he&#13;
        has continued to expand. He now sells tiles, plastic goods such as pipes, and sanitary wares such as sinks, toi-&#13;
        lets, and hand basins.&#13;
&#13;
        The second mason had quit secondary school after the first year and began working in 1997. During the pilot he&#13;
        noted that work was increasing and in 2006 he started a contracting business. At the time of the case study, he&#13;
        and his wife had an enterprise with 15 paid male workers.&#13;
&#13;
        The third mason originally was a poor farmer. In 1996, he took up masonry part-time. In 1998, he became a full-&#13;
        time mason, working in shifts with six other masons, mostly friends and relatives. During the pilot project toilet de-&#13;
        mand increased, so he decided to specialize in sanitation. He was not trained by IDE, but learned from the project&#13;
        manual and other masons. He said that he belonged to a network of 20 masons and that customers came to him&#13;
        also from other communes for his skills and good price-quality mix. Normally, the network built about eight toilets&#13;
        per month, two masons for each toilet. The income of his family of five had increased and his life had improved.&#13;
        Some customers were late in payment, but they were people from his own commune, so he was not worried that&#13;
        they would not pay. To his great happiness, his oldest son had followed in his footsteps and is now also a mason.&#13;

from relatives or through the VWU (savings and credit groups)                       While virtually everyone knew about the sanitary toilets,&#13;
and also suggested that the government should subsidize toi-                        the different models and their costs and the benefits, those&#13;

communes can apply for a one-year allocation of a loan fund,                        wanted more detailed information to help them make a de-&#13;

Table 15 gives a summary of the average percentages&#13;
achieved in each group (toilets built during the pilot and&#13;
afterwards). The toilets built during the pilot project scored&#13;
an average of 85% of the maximal score on the MOH con-&#13;
struction standards. The toilets built after the pilot had an&#13;
almost 100% score. However, from the figures in Table 15&#13;
this difference seems also to be related to the toilets' ages.                    6.4 Views of the Toilet Owners&#13;

chapter goes into this question and its underlying sub-&#13;
questions:&#13;
    · Are there any signs of the approach spreading to&#13;
        neighboring communes in the pilot districts (the&#13;
        "spill-over effect")?&#13;
    · Have the pilot districts scaled up the approach to&#13;
        a district-wide approach or not, and why? And are&#13;
        there any observed impacts from this scaling up?&#13;
    · Is there any evidence of spontaneous development&#13;
        of sanitation market development without external&#13;
        intervention ("parallel development")?&#13;
                                                                         the households had sanitary toilets, but with the&#13;

     The first was that without toilet subsidies access to toilets                    9.3.2 Development of National Capacities&#13;

     The second lesson was that for many of the local govern-                         mittees in pilot districts and provinces (now expanded to&#13;

     without a sanitary toilet, government subsidies for the poor                     neighboring districts and provinces.&#13;
     were not the solution for rural toilet construction.&#13;
                                                                                      Another option could be to involve rural education insti-&#13;
     In particular, about half of those interviewed at institutional                  tutes for training-of-trainers in a scaling-up program, such&#13;
     levels pointed out that subsidization on a national scale in                     as was done for CLTS with the use of a regional rural col-&#13;

     These lessons show there may be two ways forward. The&#13;
     first would be to develop and test a special marketing                           9.3.3 Improvement of New Rural Sanitation&#13;
     strategy, tailored to serve the poor, such as mentioned                          Marketing Initiatives&#13;

     have a countrywide toilet subsidy for poor households. The                       include investment for (i) periodic consumer research;&#13;
     second would be to develop a much better targeted toilet                         (ii)  advocacy for sanitation and sanitation marketing;&#13;

A major recommendation that emerged from the findings                                The problems noted included the large numbers&#13;
and conclusions is to develop and test a special rural sani-                         of the poor based on national criteria and the lack&#13;
tation marketing strategy for the poor (Box 8). This strat-                          of resources for providing a toilet subsidy to more&#13;

of talks and discussions (including by trained toilet masons)                    and in India and Indonesia not down to village level. This&#13;
in special sanitation and other meetings, and home visits.                       will make it harder for the CHW workers in these countries&#13;
They also used messages that were based on consumer                              to play a similar crucial role in rural sanitation marketing as&#13;

            Vietnam - Global Scaling Up Sanitation
            Project : case study on sustainability of rural sanitation marketing
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This case study of the sustainability of
            rural sanitation marketing is part of a wider activity
            entitled 'Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing
            (TSSM): new approaches to Stimulate and Scale up Sanitation
            Demand and Supply Project,' also known as the Global
            Scaling up Sanitation Project. The long-term vision for this
            effort is to help a number of developing countries meet the
            basic sanitation needs of the rural poor who do not
            currently have access to safe and hygienic sanitation. TSSM
            tests proven and promising approaches to create demand for
            sanitation and improve the supply of sanitation-related
            products and services to increase household access to safe
            and sustainable sanitation; create open-defecation free
            communities; and promote improved hygiene practices. Though
            not one of the TSSM focus countries, Vietnam is one of the
            countries where a piloted approach to enhance and meet rural
            sanitation demands has had promising results.
