THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: Latin America &amp; Caribbean&#13;
based on indicator sets that measure and benchmark&#13;
regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: High income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 1,344,235&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 16,562&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 88&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 85*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;
                                                               Change in rank: -3&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 62.64&#13;

practice, showing the absolute distance to the best            Change in DTF: -0.06&#13;
performance on each Doing Business indicator. When&#13;
compared across years, the distance to frontier score          * DB2015 ranking shown is not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published&#13;

entrepreneurs in an economy has changed over time in           captures the effects of such factors as data revisions&#13;
absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;
changed relative to that in other economies.                   report for sources and definitions.&#13;

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;

&#13;
      Full planning permission may be granted unconditionally, or may&#13;
      be subject to specified conditions. Where planning permission is&#13;
      subject to conditions or refused, the reasons for the decision&#13;
      taken are included in a Notice of Determination. Failure to&#13;
      provide proper information will result in the application being&#13;
      returned to the applicant undetermined.&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;
                                                                 Submitting all relevant documents and&#13;
What do the indicators cover?                                    obtaining all necessary clearances and permits&#13;
Doing Business records all procedures required for a             Completing all required notifications and&#13;
local business to obtain a permanent electricity                 receiving all necessary inspections&#13;

as well as the time and cost to complete them. These             Obtaining external installation works and&#13;
procedures include applications and contracts with               possibly purchasing material for these works&#13;
electricity utilities, clearances from other agencies            Concluding any necessary supply contract and&#13;
and the external and final connection works. In                  obtaining final supply&#13;
addition, this year Doing Business adds two new&#13;
measures: the reliability of supply and transparency           Time required to complete each procedure&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

       Conduct title search at the Land Registry&#13;
&#13;
       There are two systems of law under which land is held in Trinidad and&#13;
       Tobago: the old or Common Law system of conveyancing, and the&#13;
       Torrens system of registered conveyancing (The Real Property Act&#13;
       system - RPA). Most of land in Trinidad (about 70%) is still held under&#13;
       the old law system. The two systems exist side by side and it is not&#13;
       uncommon to find one property consisting of lands held under both&#13;
       systems. The registration system used is dependent on where the                              â&#128;¢ TDD 500-1,200 â&#128;¢&#13;
       property is located. The deeds registartion system, established under the                     search of a single&#13;
       Common Law system, was the initial property registration system and                            document TDD&#13;
       then RPA was introduced and the property in the city of Port of Spain is                       10,00 â&#128;¢ copy of&#13;
       predominantly still held under it. This is the reason why the calculations                      each page of&#13;
       of the time and cost in the DB Report reflect the Common Law system.                           document TDD&#13;
       Under RPA, all dealings with land or property in endorsed on a                     11 days&#13;

       required to do a search for a minimum of 20 years. The search is done                        fairs.gov.tt/Land/F&#13;
       manually and entails longer time and higher costs. A search clerk                                  AQs.pdf&#13;
       conducts the title search at the Land Registry by examining the Index of&#13;
       Deeds and Country Books relating to parcel of land. The Land Registry&#13;
       created an online database which is in the testing stage and, thus, only&#13;
       grants access to search clerks. The fee for conducting a single index or a&#13;
       single deed search is TDD 10.&#13;

      * Conduct companies search at the Companies' Registries&#13;
&#13;
      Searches should also be performed on the companies which are parties&#13;
      to the transaction. Lawyers will usually use two resources to conduct&#13;
      companies searches : (1) the online registry at&#13;
      https://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/ and (2) the Companiesâ&#128;&#153; Registry. Common&#13;
      practice is to consult a companyâ&#128;&#153;s online file and what is termed the&#13;
      physical file that is held at the Companies Registry. Downloading a          Less than a day&#13;
      company file from the online registry costs TT$20.00 while physical               (online&#13;
      searches can cost anywhere around TT$500 - $1,000.00. A standard                procedure;&#13;
      companyâ&#128;&#153;s search will usually take approximately one week. The                                        TDD 20 per&#13;

      company search is done by first downloading the Company's file from                                    download&#13;
                                                                                  with procedures 1&#13;
      the Online Companies' Registry and, later, having a search clerk review&#13;

      the physical file at the Companies' Registry to ensure that the online file&#13;
      is accurate. Once the Company's file has been obtained, the attorney can&#13;
      confirm whether any charges exist which may affect the relevant&#13;
      property as well as, for the purposes of execution, the directors of the&#13;
      company can be identified.&#13;

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

                               otherwise, he will conduct piecemeal sale of the assets, both scenarios under&#13;

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Trinidad and Tobago
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Trinidad
            and Tobago. To allow for useful comparison, the profile also
            provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 Trinidad and Tobago ranks 88. A high ease
            of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment
            is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local
            firm. Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on
            business regulations and the protection of property rights
            that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan
            to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
