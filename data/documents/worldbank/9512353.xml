The Joint Japan/World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program (JJ/WBGSP) was initiated in 1987&#13;
by the government of Japan at the World Bank Institute. Its purpose is to encourage and&#13;
strengthen human resources development in developing countries. The program's mandate is&#13;
to provide to mid-career professionals in developing countries an exposure to the latest tech-&#13;
niques and knowledge on development through graduate studies. Since its inception, the&#13;
JJ/WBGSP has awarded 3,754 scholarships for study in 250 universities in 32 World Bank mem-&#13;
ber-countries. All scholarships have been funded solely through the government of Japan.&#13;
    In 2005, the JJ/WBGSP launched the Scaling-Up Program as a better means of leveraging&#13;
knowledge acquired by the sponsored scholars and of fostering a network of development prac-&#13;
titioners, including JJ/WBGSP scholars and alumni. The program has been providing opportu-&#13;
nities for scholars to generate new knowledge for development, and the World Bank recognizes&#13;
that there is a great opportunity to tap into this knowledge for the benefit not only of the schol-&#13;
ars but also of the development community as a whole. To date, the Scaling-Up Program has&#13;
held four regional conferences that gave alumni opportunities to hear outstanding papers pre-&#13;
sented by the scholars; and to network, share knowledge, and discuss current development is-&#13;
sues in the presence of the World Bank staff and Japanese government representatives. Two suc-&#13;
cessful regional conferences were held during fiscal year 2008--one in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,&#13;
in March 2007 and one in Tokyo, Japan, in June of that year.&#13;
    Two decades of experience have shown that the JJ/WBGSP is an invaluable resource for&#13;
building skills and imparting competencies to development professionals--skills that are neces-&#13;
sary for countries to prosper in the highly interconnected and competitive global economy. The&#13;
record of scholars' promotions when they return to their countries shows that the program has&#13;
reinforced their capacity to make well-informed decisions and carry out effective socioeconom-&#13;
ic reforms. The program marked its 20th anniversary with a special conference in Tokyo where&#13;
its graduates and some 150 distinguished guests from around the world gathered at Keio Uni-&#13;
versity. Many successful scholarship recipients shared testimonials regarding their experiences&#13;
in the study program.&#13;
    It is our great honor to deliver this publication containing the six theses presented and&#13;
awarded in Dar es Salaam and Tokyo. These papers address the following topics from a wide&#13;

Causes of Default in Government Microcredit Programs:&#13;
A Case Study of the Uasin Gishu District Trade&#13;
Development Joint Loan Board Scheme, Kenya&#13;

This study endeavors to investigate causes of default in government microcredit programs. The problem&#13;
identified was that government microcredit programs perform poorly because of slow repayment and high&#13;
default rates. Hence, it was important to establish if these limitations prevailed in the Uasin Gishu District&#13;
Trade Development Joint Loan Board (UGLB) scheme by determining the average repayment delay and de-&#13;
fault rate and the causes of the observed trends. The results reveal that the board has an average repayment&#13;
delay of 31 percent. The default rate increased over the review period and averaged 31 percent as well. The&#13;
main cause of default was found to be poor business performance, in terms of low profitability or business&#13;
losses. Loan diversion to unprofitable uses, domestic problems, numerous dependents, and tenancy prob-&#13;
lems were other factors that caused loan default. The inability to deal with slow repayment and default also&#13;
was a matter of concern. The study found that operations and maintenance resources are too small to facil-&#13;
itate follow-up on loan usage, and that management information systems are manual. Such systems do not&#13;
facilitate early detection of potential defaulters and slow-repaying borrowers. Further, nonprosecution of&#13;
defaulters and the perception that government credits are grants rather than loans encourage default. The&#13;
board is also understaffed, and key personnel have limited computer skills--factors that cause delays in&#13;
processing and disbursing loans. Study recommendations are geared largely toward improving the board's&#13;
capacity to manage the loan program. The board should computerize its management information system&#13;
and build staff capacity in computer applications. Staff strength should be increased, and sufficient opera-&#13;
tions and maintenance budgets should be provided. Processes should be worked out to identify borrower ca-&#13;
pacity and any obligations that may interfere with repayment. Finally, the board should intensify recovery&#13;
of outstanding balances from defaulters through increased borrower follow-up.&#13;
&#13;

Microenterprises are an important source of livelihood for many people in the developing&#13;
world. Consequently, lending institutions have shown an interest in these enterprises through&#13;
the provision of microcredit. Whereas some lending institutions are profit oriented, government&#13;

mainly provides alternative credit to the most vulnerable groups to enable them to attain the&#13;
standard of creditworthiness required by commercial lending institutions.&#13;
   "Microcredit" refers to small loans extended to poor people so they can undertake self-&#13;
employment projects that generate income and enable them to provide for themselves and their&#13;
families. This form of credit is targeted toward people in the lower economic brackets of society.&#13;
   Rural-based microcredit programs in particular have the potential to help poor people per-&#13;
form some business activities through which they may acquire employment as well as income.&#13;
As such, microcredit provision has been an effective development intervention because such&#13;
services can be directed specifically to the poorest members of the population.&#13;
   In Kenya, the 2003­07 Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation&#13;
(ERS) policy document has set a target to create 500,000 jobs annually during the recovery peri-&#13;
od. Accordingly, it intends that 88 percent of those jobs be created in small and medium enter-&#13;
prises (SMEs). These enterprises also are expected to contribute to a decline in poverty rates--&#13;
from 56.7 percent to 51.8 percent. Therefore, provision of microcredit is regarded not only as a&#13;
tool for empowering the poor, but also as an instrument for alleviating poverty in Kenya.&#13;
   Because poverty alleviation has been a key development challenge since independence&#13;
(1963), different programs have been initiated to address the need for microcredit. These initia-&#13;
tives include the Trade Development Joint Loan Board Program conceived of in 1954 and put&#13;
into operation in 1966, the Rural Enterprise Fund Program initiated in 1991 and first disbursed&#13;
in 1992, and the District Poverty Eradication Program rolled out to all districts in 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
History of Government Credit Programs&#13;
&#13;
District Trade Development Joint Loan Board Scheme&#13;
&#13;
The District Trade Development Joint Loan Board (DLB) scheme in Kenya was launched by the&#13;
British colonial administration in 1954. The institutional structure was formalized, however, at&#13;
the time of independence, through legal notice 265 of 1963 local government regulation 104. The&#13;
program was established to administer loans to Kenyan industrialists, artisans, and business-&#13;
men. The program's objectives were to provide financial support and an opportunity to gain&#13;
commercial experience. Over time, loans were intended to assist in business expansion and&#13;
were focused mainly on rural areas where the financial sector was underdeveloped. The initia-&#13;
tives also were intended to check rural­urban migration.&#13;
   Since inception, the DLBs have provided financing to SMEs in most districts of Kenya. Indi-&#13;
viduals, registered partnerships, and cooperatives are eligible for these loans. Repayment is de-&#13;
signed so that the capital sum is repaid in equal monthly installments of principal and interest&#13;
combined. The program also demands security; but where the borrower has no attachable as-&#13;
sets, a responsible person's firm legal guarantee of repayment is obtained.&#13;
   Although DLBs have been providing loans since independence, reports on nationwide fig-&#13;
ures are not available at the district trade office. A monitoring and evaluation report on joint&#13;
loan boards, released in May 2005, however, defines the performance of boards for five financial&#13;
years. Table 1.1 shows the total amounts of loans disbursed and recovered countrywide through&#13;
the joint loan board schemes from fiscal 2000/01 to 2004/05.&#13;
   It is notable that more than K Sh 90.2 million was disbursed by the UGLB and approximate-&#13;
ly K Sh 73.3 million was recovered. The recovered funds are amounts repaid during the respec-&#13;
tive years, some of which are for loans disbursed in earlier years. The considerable decline in the&#13;
amount of money disbursed in fiscal 2001/02 resulted from restructuring and reorganization of&#13;
Ministry of Trade and Industry field offices.&#13;
   It is also noteworthy that, during the period under review, 13 of 48 joint loan boards dis-&#13;
bursed no loans to entrepreneurs and, hence, were dormant. A monitoring and evaluation re-&#13;
port (Ministry of Trade and Industry 2005), however, shows the UGLB leading other boards&#13;
countrywide in total amounts disbursed and recovered annually over the period (table 1.2).&#13;

    With respect to nonperforming loans, the UGLB had a total of 52 nonperforming loans&#13;
(amounting to K Sh 1,361,642.30). The best-performing loan board was the Nairobi Special Loans&#13;
Board, which had only seven nonperforming loans (amounting to K Sh 121,561.70). Other joint&#13;
loan boards (Busia, Kisumu, and Wajir) had substantial amounts in nonperforming loans--&#13;
amounts ranging from K Sh 6.0 million to K Sh 11.0 million.&#13;

Rural Enterprise Fund&#13;
&#13;
The Rural Enterprise Fund was established in 1991 to increase the productive capacity of the&#13;
borrowers and thereby create self-employment and income-generating opportunities. That out-&#13;
come was to be achieved by providing loans to small, productive enterprises operated on a self-&#13;
sustaining basis in rural areas. There were two eligibility criteria: (1) that the activities under-&#13;
taken be rural based and (2) that those activities generate employment.&#13;
    The loans were to be repaid at an interest rate of 8 percent, with a grace period of one year on&#13;
both interest and principal. They were to be repaid in equal monthly installments within five&#13;
years. Loan security was based largely on an applicant's reputation and character. However, as-&#13;
sets purchased with the proceeds of loans made under the fund were to be charged as security&#13;
in an appropriate form. One critical aspect of the program was its revolving nature, whereby in-&#13;
terest and principal amounts repaid would be re-lent to other needy people.&#13;
    The Rural Enterprise Fund was characterized by a high default rate. Table 1.3 provides a&#13;
summary of the fund's performance in Uasin Gishu District, based on available records. The ini-&#13;
tial allocation to the district was K Sh 7,705,229.00. In 2001, the outstanding balances had risen&#13;
to K Sh 8,821,774.60 on the principal alone.&#13;
    In addition to the generally dismal performance of the fund, it is notable that repayment&#13;
worsened in fiscal 1999/2000. It is further noteworthy that no records were available beyond&#13;
2001 in the official returns format. The fund is no longer operational, at least in terms of dis-&#13;
bursement.&#13;

    Available records show that, by 1997, the government was concerned about the fund's wide-&#13;
spread high default rate and set up a task force to discover the reasons for the defaults. At that&#13;
time, the arrears for outstanding cases countrywide totaled K Sh 148,327,505. Uasin Gishu Dis-&#13;
trict had an outstanding balance of K Sh 9,270,199, and Eldoret Municipality had an outstanding&#13;
balance of K Sh 10,712,481. (This study was not able to access the task force's findings on the&#13;
causes of default.)&#13;

District Poverty Eradication Program&#13;
&#13;
The District Poverty Eradication Program was established by the government in 2002. Its objec-&#13;
tives were (1) to encourage poor people to save and become more productive, (2) to provide and&#13;
promote access to cheap and affordable credit, (3) to strengthen existing alternative credit&#13;
among the poor communities, and (4) to promote innovative approaches to the provision of ba-&#13;
sic social services (Poverty Eradication Commission 2002).&#13;
    Unlike the UGLB, the District Poverty Eradication Program targets well-mobilized groups&#13;
engaged in income-generating activities. It demands no collateral, but does require that the suc-&#13;
cessful applicant projects enter into agreements with a financial intermediary prior to the re-&#13;
lease of funds. Where deserving poor people are not organized into groups, special effort is&#13;
made to mobilize them and build their readiness for program support. In the first and second&#13;
phases of the program, K Sh 900,000 and K Sh 600,000, respectively, have been disbursed to 12&#13;
groups. Table 1.4 presents a sample of disbursement and repayment statistics for this program.&#13;

Details of the Study&#13;
&#13;
The government of Kenya has provided microcredit through various credit programs (such as&#13;
the District Trade Development Joint Loan Board, the Rural Enterprise Fund, and Kenya Indus-&#13;
trial Estates). Government credit programs operate on a revolving-fund basis whereby new&#13;
loans can be made as existing loans are repaid. Available information, however, shows that re-&#13;
payment has been poor (either slow or nonexistent) and program sustainability has been com-&#13;
promised. As a result of poor repayment, a number of joint loan boards are dormant and others&#13;
have substantial amounts committed to nonperforming loans. For example, the Rural Enter-&#13;
prise Fund is defunct, having collapsed with substantial outstanding balances. Ikiara (cited in&#13;
Nasiuma 2003) found that business owners assisted by Kenya Industrial Estates do not pay their&#13;
debts on time or do not pay them at all, thus constraining that program's ability to help other&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
   With such dismal performance, most government programs have failed to achieve their pre-&#13;
determined objectives and have caused huge monetary losses. To advance the understanding of&#13;
weaknesses in such programs, this study was designed to investigate the causes of loan default&#13;
in the Uasin Gishu District Trade Development Joint Loan Board scheme.&#13;
   The study focuses on the UGLB, a government microcredit program, covering its perform-&#13;
ance in terms of disbursement and loan recovery from microentrepreneurs who received finan-&#13;
cial support between the years 2000 and 2005.&#13;
   The study report is organized in five sections. The first section provided background infor-&#13;
mation on microcredit in general and on initiatives of the government of Kenya to provide mi-&#13;
crocredit. Section two presents a literature review. The methodology used to collect and analyze&#13;
data is explained in the third section, and section four deals with the research findings. The final&#13;
section offers conclusions and policy recommendations for enhancing the performance of the&#13;
UGLB.&#13;
   The study results will be used for policy formulation and decision making with respect to&#13;
government microcredit programs. The findings will be useful to the government's district&#13;
trade offices, development offices, and other departments that implement government micro-&#13;
credit initiatives. Finally, the study will contribute to the existing body of literature and form a&#13;
basis for additional research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Literature Review&#13;
&#13;
This review of the existing literature covers studies relevant to the research topic. Areas re-&#13;
viewed include the role of microcredit, default in repayment and its effect on microcredit pro-&#13;
grams, and challenges facing the microcredit subsector. Literature on strategies applied to min-&#13;
imize default also is discussed here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Role of Microcredit&#13;
&#13;
Microfinancing is a strategy for alleviating poverty. It is broadly accepted that robust, labor-&#13;
intensive, and equitable economic growth combined with larger outlays for social programs (es-&#13;
pecially directed toward the poor populace, now estimated at 1.3 billion people worldwide) is a&#13;
winning formula in the fight against poverty (UN 1997).&#13;
   According to the UN Secretary-General (UN 1997), there is increased interest in microcredit&#13;
to promote growth with greater equity. His report noted that growth occurs through empower-&#13;
ing all people by increasing their access to all factors of production, including credit. The report&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6     Causes of Default in Government Microcredit Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
also observed that poor people's latent capacity for entrepreneurship would be encouraged by&#13;
the availability of small-scale loans that would introduce them to the small-enterprise sector.&#13;
Microcredit could enable them to be more self-reliant, could create employment opportunities,&#13;
and could release women to engage in economically productive activities.&#13;
   In Kenya, the 2003­07 Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation&#13;
provides the road map for economic recovery. The strategy paper identified restoring economic&#13;
growth, generating employment opportunities, and reducing poverty levels as key challenges&#13;
facing Kenya (Ministry of Planning and National Development 2003). The paper estimated that&#13;
SMEs contribute 18 percent and 72 percent to the national gross domestic product and employ-&#13;
ment, respectively. Hence, when the ERS anticipated creating 500,000 jobs annually, 88 percent&#13;
of the targeted jobs were to be created in SMEs. Elsewhere, a survey of SMEs identified a lack of&#13;
access to affordable credit as one of the key constraints facing the SME subsector.&#13;
   Microcredit generally is important to the growth and development of microenterprises.&#13;
However, many credit programs previously viewed the poor as potential defaulters and placed&#13;
credit programs beyond their reach. Even though wide experience today shows that poor peo-&#13;
ple are not bad credit risks and that their repayment rates can be exemplary, the poor still are&#13;
considered to be a high-risk credit population, expensive to serve, and unable to pay the full&#13;
cost of credit; they are believed to require government subsidization of credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Repayment Default and Its Effect on Microcredit Programs&#13;
&#13;
The most dangerous problem a microcredit program faces is repayment default. The Associa-&#13;
tion for Social Advancement (ASA, a Bangladesh-based nongovernmental organization focus-&#13;
ing on microfinance) has pointed out that if the money invested by the lending organizations&#13;
cannot be recovered, the whole program may collapse.&#13;
   Any formal lending program directed toward the poor faces a number of challenges. The&#13;
first problem is exact targeting to ensure no Type I or Type II errors, as defined by Cornia and&#13;
Stewart (1992). These are errors of omission of poor people and of inclusion of nonpoor people.&#13;
The second problem is screening to distinguish the good (creditworthy) borrowers from the bad&#13;
(not-so-creditworthy) borrowers. This is a problem because poor borrowers generally do not&#13;
maintain any accounts of their past business activity or furnish any documented business plan&#13;
for use of the loan they are seeking. Third, the funding agencies may not be able to monitor and&#13;
ensure productive usage of the loans. Viewed differently, the challenge here is determining&#13;
whether the loan application is for the purpose of expanding a profitable ongoing business or&#13;
whether it will be channeled into unprofitable operations.&#13;
   Achieving and maintaining repayment discipline is crucial to the sustainability of any mi-&#13;
crocredit program. Lending institutions must make good loans because default without sanc-&#13;
tions will damage the people's commitment and the whole program may collapse.&#13;
   Generally, the conventional theory of rural development finance shows that rural finance in&#13;
low-income countries has many inherent failures, including low levels of loan recovery, insuffi-&#13;
cient savings mobilization, high transaction costs, and distribution bias to relatively wealthier&#13;
customers. According to Izumida and Duong (2001), exceptional success was found in Vietnam.&#13;
For example, Central Java's Badan Kredit Kecamatan has shown considerable promise in pro-&#13;
viding the access to microcredit and the convenience and flexibility desired by poor borrowers&#13;
while ensuring the credit institution's financial viability by minimizing administrative costs and&#13;
imposing interest rates sufficient to cover costs and prevent capital erosion. The bank, however,&#13;
did have problems when it experienced delayed borrower repayments among other failures&#13;
(Riedinger 1994).&#13;
   Several factors predispose borrowers to default. Beneficiaries of microcredit tend to use their&#13;
credit for the same limited range of small-scale activities. In any given situation, it is likely that&#13;
only a limited range of economically viable small-scale activities is available to the poor and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                        Rose Ajiambo Bwonya-Wakuloba  7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that there is a limited demand for the product of any particular activity (Bundell 1997). These&#13;
factors increase poor people's vulnerability to defaulting.&#13;
    Diagne and Zeller (2001) analyzed the determinants of access to credit and its impact on&#13;
farm and nonfarm income and on household food security in Malawi. Their report showed that&#13;
the contribution of rural microfinance institutions to smallholder income can be limited or neg-&#13;
ative if the design of the institutions and their services do not take into account the constraints&#13;
and demands of their clients.&#13;
    A vast body of literature supports the view that borrower characteristics are highly influen-&#13;
tial determinants of repayment. There also is strong evidence that institutional characteristics&#13;
are equally important and that both factors need to be taken into account if loan default is to be&#13;
minimized (Derban, Binner, and Mullineux 2005).&#13;
    Regarding the poor borrower, ASA noted that difficulty in meeting family expenditures may&#13;
leave a borrower no option but to spend the loan to cover such expenditures. The same study&#13;
found that the poor did not invest all loan money in income-generating activities, but spent part&#13;
of it making payments on previous loans and meeting family expenses.&#13;
    Basu (1997) examined why institutions remain unable to extend credit to rural poor people.&#13;
His analysis indicated that, at best, poor peasants can offer as a mortgage an entitlement set com-&#13;
prising only future shares of their harvest--a commodity itself subject to risk. Loan repayment by&#13;
borrower farmers is influenced by timeliness of input supply, participation in off-farm activities,&#13;
and yield loss due to natural calamities, among other things (Hundie, Belay, and Demeke 2004).&#13;
Consequently, lenders cannot advance loans without risking extensive loss of loanable funds.&#13;
    It is also true that public perception of credit programs is an important factor influencing de-&#13;
fault. Studies in Africa have revealed a tendency for people to think that funds from the gov-&#13;
ernment are free and do not require repayment. Tunisia has had a strong tradition of nonrepay-&#13;
ment of government-provided loans (ENDA 2005). Similarly, Makina and Malobola (2004)&#13;
studied the causes of low repayment for South Africa's Khula Enterprise Finance credits. They&#13;
found that a major contributing factor for default was beneficiaries' perception that the mi-&#13;
croloans were free government grants.&#13;
    With respect to institutional factors, the efficiency of the lending institution can reduce de-&#13;
fault. In Nepal, for instance, the more efficient microfinance institutions managed by the private&#13;
sector were found to be better off than government-owned institutions. Efficiency may come&#13;
from improvement in processes, computerization of management information systems, and im-&#13;
proved financial management. Particularly with microcredit, small loans can be profitable only if&#13;
administrative costs are reduced to a bare minimum. The Kenya Women Finance Trust's strategy&#13;
is to keep administrative costs down and link the growth in lending to the availability of funds.&#13;
    Regarding default in joint loan board programs, an impact study carried out by KK Consult-&#13;
ing Associates attributed default to poor program management, which resulted in minimal&#13;
follow-up on borrowers. The report noted that there are no systematic follow-up procedures.&#13;
    Furthermore, commercial law in Kenya provides a debtor's limitation period. The law states,&#13;
"If a creditor does not demand repayment of the loan from his debtor within six years of the&#13;
loan, he cannot enforce his claim in the court in case the debtor refuses to pay" (Hussain 1978).&#13;
    Elsewhere, lenders of microcredit have been found to have limited, if any, means of mitigat-&#13;
ing damages in the event of default because poor people lack assets to back up their loans and&#13;
poor countries lack civil infrastructure (such as adequate court systems) to collect bad debt.&#13;
Without a safety net for loans in default, microcredit portfolios can fail if borrowers perceive&#13;
that there are no consequences for defaulting on their loans.&#13;
    It is also true that there are costs to a lending institution for being in arrears. Arrears deplete&#13;
portfolio turnover and erode the image of the institution. It has been found that clients of such&#13;
an institution will inform themselves of the chance that the institution will fail and that debts&#13;
will begin to grow rapidly. Within the institution, personnel blame each other and the institu-&#13;
tion's prestige plummets--which again compromises the institution's sustainability.&#13;

8     Causes of Default in Government Microcredit Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategies to Minimize Defaults&#13;
&#13;
Because of the vulnerability of the microcredit subsector, lending institutions continue to adopt&#13;
different techniques to improve repayment frequency and grant more credit access to borrowers&#13;
who pay their loans on time.&#13;
    The Grameen Bank model is cited widely as the most successful microfinance institution. The&#13;
Grameen Bank, founded by Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, emerged from pro-poor grass-&#13;
roots institutions. According to this model, the prospective clientele is identified after the pur-&#13;
pose, functions, and mode of operation are explained to the population of the area covered--&#13;
usually 15 to 22 villages. Identifying clients in this manner resolves the problem of direct target-&#13;
ing by specifying the members' eligibility requirements on the basis of asset ownership. Indirect-&#13;
ly, the model may make the loan amounts small and may lay down conditions (such as atten-&#13;
dance at weekly member meetings) so that the nonpoor are discouraged from borrowing (Hulme&#13;
and Mosley 1996). The meetings reinforce a culture of discipline, routine repayments, and staff&#13;
accountability. With such innovative practices, Grameen Bank has risen to fame for its perform-&#13;
ance in targeting and for its low default rates, which average 3 percent.&#13;
    The Kenya Women Finance Trust believes that small loans are expensive to administer and&#13;
that the institution can survive only by charging competitive interest rates, lending to women,&#13;
and keeping defaults to a bare minimum. Women are targeted as clients by this trust because&#13;
they have been found to have a high propensity to repay.&#13;
    According to Mann (1993), some lenders prefer known clients to avoid default. People on a&#13;
loan committee will give preference to an applicant with whom they have dealt previously.&#13;
Hence, lending institutions will give money based on previous banking experience with the&#13;
client. The same study also showed that institutions lend to profitable businesses that have cash&#13;
flow available to pay back the loan.&#13;
    Another strategy for dealing with default is lending to groups. The collective coming togeth-&#13;
er of individuals is useful in a number of ways, including peer pressure that obliges the mem-&#13;
bers to work within agreed norms. Although studies indicate that such schemes work well if&#13;
groups are homogeneous and jointly liable for defaults, the practice of denying credit to all&#13;
group members in case of default is the most effective and least costly way to enforce joint lia-&#13;
bility (Huppi and Feder 1990).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Three Cs of Microcredit&#13;
&#13;
The literature also describes three "Cs" that should be observed to reduce default when provid-&#13;
ing microcredit: character, capacity, and capital.&#13;
    Character refers to the way a person has handled past debt obligations. Paying heed to char-&#13;
acter includes determining the borrower's credit history and personal background, honesty,&#13;
and reliability to pay credit debts. Considering a borrower's capacity involves determining how&#13;
much debt he or she can handle comfortably by analyzing income streams and identifying any&#13;
legal obligations that could interfere with repayment. Capital refers to a borrower's current&#13;
available assets, such as real estate, savings, or investments that could be used to repay debt if&#13;
income is unavailable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Lessons from the Literature Review&#13;
&#13;
A number of lessons can be drawn from the literature reviewed. The following lessons are par-&#13;
ticularly pertinent to this study:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Microcredit is important to the growth and development of microenterprises.&#13;
    2. Lending programs directed toward the poor face unique problems of targeting, distin-&#13;
       guishing between creditworthy and not-so-creditworthy borrowers, and monitoring the&#13;
       productive use of loans.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                      Rose Ajiambo Bwonya-Wakuloba  9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    3. Default on repayment poses a major challenge to the survival of microcredit programs,&#13;
        especially in relation to the achievement of a lending institution's broad objectives.&#13;
    4. There are many factors that predispose poor borrowers to default. Borrowers in poverty&#13;
        have other pressing needs that may interfere with the productive use of the microcredit ex-&#13;
        tended to them. Furthermore, character, capacity, and capital play a role in loan repayment.&#13;
    5. The public perception that government credit is a grant influences default and is a major&#13;
        challenge to government loan programs. Default rates increase when government is be-&#13;
        lieved to fund a microcredit program.&#13;
    6. The lending institution should maintain efficiency in terms of improved processes, com-&#13;
        puterized information systems, and improved financial management to handle its credit&#13;
        programs effectively.&#13;
    7. Poor management and a lack of effective legal infrastructure to prosecute defaulters en-&#13;
        courage default. Without a safety net for defaulted loans, microcredit portfolios can fail if&#13;
        borrowers perceive that there are no consequences for loan default.&#13;
    8. To deal with default, institutions have adopted strategies for minimizing default in mi-&#13;
        crocredit. These include imposing conditions to which members must adhere, targeting&#13;
        women as borrowers, doing repeat business with borrowers who have good repayment&#13;
        records, and lending to groups to promote joint liability.&#13;

Study Methodology&#13;
&#13;
This section describes the methods used in carrying out this study. It explains the data types,&#13;
sources, and procedures used for the comparative analysis, and it describes the data collection&#13;
instruments and techniques and the sampling procedures followed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Study Area&#13;
&#13;
The study covers the Uasin Gishu District, one of the 18 districts in Kenya's Rift Valley Province.&#13;
According to the Ministry of Planning and National Development's 2002­08 district develop-&#13;
ment plan, the district has 85 trading centers with 8,000 licensed businesses. According to dis-&#13;
trict trade office records, in 2005 alone, 1,516 businesses had been licensed by October.&#13;
    The choice of study area was made out of an interest in the UGLB's operations and was&#13;
strengthened by the board's consistency in disbursing loans. An additional factor contributing&#13;
to the choice of study area was the rapid growth of microfinance institutions in the district.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Types and Sources&#13;
&#13;
Both primary and secondary data sources are used in this study. Primary data were collected&#13;
through questionnaires. Other sources of data include information taken from official reports,&#13;
file records, and statistics issued by the relevant institutions. In addition, secondary document-&#13;
ed data were obtained from both published and unpublished literature related to the topic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sample Size and Sampling Techniques&#13;
&#13;
The UGLB has made a total of 26 disbursements since its inception in 1973. This study, howev-&#13;
er, focuses on the period 2001­04 during which a total of three disbursements was made (2001,&#13;
2002, and 2004). A total of 161 clients benefited from the board's work over that period. Of that&#13;
total, a sample of 100 clients was selected for data collection concerning the reasons for default&#13;
among those who did not repay and those who repaid slowly, and concerning the factors influ-&#13;
encing timely repayment by the regular borrowers. All borrowers were assigned to one of three&#13;
categories: defaulters, slow repayers, and regular borrowers.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10    Causes of Default in Government Microcredit Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Stratified and systematic sampling techniques were used. Stratified sampling guaranteed&#13;
representation from each disbursement cohort at one level and representation of regular bor-&#13;
rowers, slow repayers, and defaulters. Systematic sampling also was applied to capture clients&#13;
as they came to repay loans.&#13;
   Purposive sampling was done to provide the UGLB's information. Four board staff directly&#13;
involved in the day-to-day running of the loan program were interviewed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Collection Instruments&#13;
&#13;
Several data collection instruments were used during the study. Primary data were generated&#13;
from two types of questionnaires. The first type comprised two questionnaires administered to&#13;
defaulters, slow repayers, and regular borrowers. The questionnaires had four sections: section&#13;
A inquired about the borrower's personal and business details; section B sought information on&#13;
causes of default or timely repayment; section C dealt with business performance; and section D&#13;
addressed the effect of loan repayment on the enterprise, family, and community.&#13;
   The other type of questionnaire was used in interviews with board officials. It had three sec-&#13;
tions: section A inquired about the official's personal details, including professional qualifica-&#13;
tions, work experience, and main responsibilities; section B sought the interviewee's considered&#13;
opinion on causes of default and factors influencing loan repayment; and section C dealt with&#13;
the impact of loan repayment on the UGLB scheme.&#13;
   Secondary data were obtained from a number of data instruments used by the trade office.&#13;
These instruments included the loan application form, the appraisal of the applicant, and the&#13;
loan agreement form. The other tool was the account ledger for each group to which funds were&#13;
disbursed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Collection Procedures&#13;
&#13;
The data were collected at two levels. Primary data were obtained by administering the ques-&#13;
tionnaires to selected loan beneficiaries who defaulted and to borrowers who completed their&#13;
loan repayments.&#13;
   Prior to its use in the field, the questionnaire was tested using board clients in each of the&#13;
three categories who are based in the town of Eldoret, the administrative center of Uasin Gishu&#13;
District. Following this testing, research assistants went to the field under the guidance of an of-&#13;
ficer from the trade office to help identify borrowers. One research assistant was based at the&#13;
trade office to administer the questionnaires to board clients as they came to repay their loans.&#13;
This in-office process captured eight borrowers who were either slow repayers or defaulters.&#13;
   The board clients' questionnaire captured data on their demographic and socioeconomic&#13;
characteristics, business characteristics, and causes for default or timely repayment. For busi-&#13;
ness classifications, the study adopted the classifications of the Trade Licensing Act, Cap 497, of&#13;
the laws of Kenya.&#13;
   Additionally, a questionnaire was administered to the board staff to find out the board's con-&#13;
sidered opinion on the causes of default and the factors influencing repayment. The question-&#13;
naire's three sections asked about board officials' professional qualifications, their duties, and&#13;
the loan program's performance.&#13;
   Relevant secondary data gathered from the loan application forms, the applicant appraisal&#13;
forms, and the account ledgers included information on clients' locations, demographics, busi-&#13;
ness attributes, recommended loan amounts, and repayment plans.&#13;
   Data also were gathered from the account ledgers maintained by the trade office. The books&#13;
provided up-to-date loan repayment data for each client. Evaluating the ledgers alongside the&#13;
approved repayment plans of respective borrowers enabled us to identify regular borrowers,&#13;
slow repayers, and defaulters.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                        Rose Ajiambo Bwonya-Wakuloba  11&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Analysis&#13;
&#13;
The study used a comparative analysis approach to investigate the causes of default in govern-&#13;
ment microcredit.&#13;
      To facilitate data analysis, 100 questionnaires collected were serialized and coded before being&#13;
entered into Microsoft Excel software. After data cleaning, only 92 questionnaires were found suit-&#13;
able for analysis. Data then were exported to SPSS statistical analysis software. Descriptive analy-&#13;
ses tools, such as frequencies and percentages, were used to study the repayment performance&#13;
and other relationships of interest. In addition, various qualitative analyses were applied to estab-&#13;
lish causes of default in repaying the board's credit. Secondary data concerning board clients' re-&#13;
payment performances were entered in Excel spreadsheets to compute relevant statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Study Findings&#13;
&#13;
This section presents the study's findings on the causes of default in a government microcredit&#13;
program--specifically, the UGLB. The average repayment delay period and default rates are es-&#13;
timated and factors that contributed to loan default and slow repayment are presented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UGLB Clients' Profile&#13;
&#13;
Ninety-two clients who received loans from the UGLB during the study period were analyzed.&#13;
Two-thirds of the clients were repeat borrowers (having received other loans before or during&#13;
the study period). About 70 percent of the clients were male. All clients were aged 28 to 79 years,&#13;
with a mean of 47. Sixty-five percent of them were aged 40­59 years. Figure 1.1 shows the age&#13;
distribution of the study sample.&#13;
      The education level of borrowers ranged from no education to postsecondary training. Ninety-&#13;
one percent of the clients had either primary or secondary education, with 51 percent having&#13;
secondary education. The great majority of the clients were married (86 percent); approximate-&#13;
ly 10 percent were single; and 4 percent were separated, divorced, or widowed.&#13;
      The amount of money disbursed to each client ranged between K Sh 20,000 and K Sh 50,000.&#13;
These loans were to be repaid over a period ranging from 12 to 18 months. At the time of the&#13;
study, outstanding balances per slow-repaying or defaulting client went as high as K Sh 44,000.&#13;
Some clients had made no payments at all on their loan accounts.&#13;
      Board clients had varied amounts of business experience--from as little as six months to as&#13;
much as 43 years. The common type of businesses run by 73 percent of board clients fell mainly&#13;
in regulated trade (retail). Manufacturing, motor vehicle repair, hotel and catering services, and&#13;
miscellaneous businesses together amounted to only 27 percent.&#13;

12     Causes of Default in Government Microcredit Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    With respect to income levels, 65 percent of those interviewed said that their income level&#13;
had improved to either an average or high extent since receiving the trade loan. About 85 per-&#13;
cent had personal income above K Sh 2,000 per month, with approximately 45 percent reporting&#13;
personal monthly income of more than K Sh 8,000. The major source of income among the bor-&#13;
rowers was their business enterprise, although 34 percent had diversified, with farming or em-&#13;
ployment as their major source of income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Loan Default Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Because both slow repayment and default rates negatively affect the UGLB's performance, iden-&#13;
tifying the average repayment delay and the default rate is important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    AVERAGE REPAYMENT DELAY. Of the 92 UGLB beneficiaries studied, 45 exceeded the repay-&#13;
ment periods stated in their loan agreements. The repayment delays described in figure 1.2 are&#13;
the months between the agreed repayment periods and actual completion of the loans by the&#13;
slow repayers. The analysis revealed that slow repayers delayed repaying their loans for one to&#13;
23 months. Most of them cleared their loans within five months after the expiration of the loan&#13;
agreement period.&#13;
    Table 1.5 provides the descriptive statistics of the slow repayers over the study period. The&#13;
repayment delay was calculated as the number of months delayed in completing a loan, divid-&#13;
ed by the agreed repayment period in months, and then multiplied by 100. The results indicate&#13;
that the minimum repayment delay occurred among those who were to repay in 18 months&#13;
(they delayed an average of one month); the maximum delay occurred among those who were&#13;
to repay in 12 months (they delayed an average of 23 months). Therefore, the average repay-&#13;
ment delay among the UGLB's slow-repayment borrowers was approximately 31 percent&#13;
longer than the agreed period. In other words, a slow-repayment board client who received a&#13;
loan to repay in 12 months was more likely to repay it in 16 months, a client given a loan to re-&#13;
pay in 18 months was more likely to repay in about 24 months, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    REPAYMENT AND DEFAULT RATES. In this study, it was important also to compute the study co-&#13;
hort's default rate for the UGLB scheme. Table 1.6 shows the board's performance in 2001, 2002,&#13;

and 2004 by comparing total disbursements with total repayments and outstanding balances at&#13;
the ends of the loan agreement periods. The default rate, therefore, is based on outstanding bal-&#13;
ances at the ends of the agreed repayment periods. It is clear from the outstanding balances and&#13;
amounts disbursed that the board experienced default rates of 22 percent, 33 percent, and 39&#13;
percent for 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively. The results give rise to an overall average default&#13;
rate of approximately 31 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Slow-Repayment Borrowers&#13;
&#13;
Borrowers who exceed their agreed repayment schedules are viewed as a type of defaulter be-&#13;
cause they did not repay their loans on time. Therefore, it was important in this study to estab-&#13;
lish the causes of slow repayment. Figure 1.3 shows the causes for default stated by the slow re-&#13;
payers. It emerges that diversion of funds and poor business performance were the key causes&#13;
of untimely loan repayments. Other borrowers were affected by business closure or by having&#13;
many dependents.&#13;

Using the responses gathered from the questionnaires, the study established a number of caus-&#13;
es for default among UGLB clients. Figure 1.4 provides a frequency distribution of the causes of&#13;
default among the board's clients.&#13;
   Thirty-six percent of the defaulters attributed their nonrepayment to poor business perform-&#13;
ance. Twenty percent cited domestic problems, and another 10 percent admitted having divert-&#13;
ed the funds to other unprofitable uses. Poor timing, tenancy problems, theft, and business clo-&#13;
sure also were named as causes for default, although on a small scale.&#13;
   The "other" causes (10 percent) of nonpayment identified among the defaulting borrowers&#13;
included harsh economic conditions, stiff competition, government policy banning certain ac-&#13;
tivities, servicing of other loans, and bad debts on services offered to their customers.&#13;

    Owing to the sensitive nature of the issue of default, the study endeavored to find out&#13;
whether household characteristics contributed to nonrepayment. The study was interested in&#13;
establishing any relationship between a borrower's number of dependents and the cause of de-&#13;
fault, or between the major source of income and the cause of default. Table 1.7 shows that about&#13;
three-quarters of the defaulters had five or more dependents, and that approximately 60 percent&#13;
of the borrowers relied on the microenterprise for most of their income. Table 1.8 provides cross-&#13;
tabulations between the number of dependents and the cited cause of default and between the&#13;
major source of income and the cited cause of default.&#13;
    The cross-tabulations show that many defaulters who had a large number of dependents&#13;
also experienced poor business performance, diverted funds, or had domestic problems. It is&#13;
surprising, however, that only two defaulters cited "many dependents" as the cause of default&#13;
(both of whom had five or more dependents). The associated p-value of the cross-tabulation be-&#13;
tween many dependents and cause of default was 0.534 (53.4 percent), meaning that many de-&#13;
pendents and cause of default are statistically independent.&#13;

    Table 1.8 also shows that many defaulters who relied for income on the microbusiness alone&#13;
experienced poor business performance. Because approximately 60 percent relied on the busi-&#13;
ness as the main income source, the vulnerability of the microenterprise to poor business per-&#13;
formance was revealed. The cross-tabulation for major source of income and cause of default&#13;
had a p-ratio of 0 percent, which indicated that the major source of income and the cause of de-&#13;
fault are statistically dependent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Comparative Analysis of the Causes of Default among Slow Repayers and Defaulters&#13;
&#13;
The analysis of causes of default revealed that there are variations on causes of default among&#13;
the two categories--slow repayers and defaulters. Table 1.9 compares the percentage of respon-&#13;
dents in each category who cited each reason as the main cause for default. The results indicate&#13;
that poor business performance is a key cause of default identified by both slow repayers and&#13;
defaulters. Although half of the slow repayers attributed their default to diversion of funds to&#13;
unprofitable uses, only 10 percent of the defaulters did so. Hence, although diversion may in-&#13;
crease the possibility for defaulting, it may not be the major cause. Domestic problems and oth-&#13;
er causes (including harsh economic conditions, stiff competition, servicing of other loans, and&#13;
bad debts) also were important, especially among defaulters.&#13;

UGLB's Perspective on the Causes of Default&#13;
&#13;
The UGLB believes that some defaults occur because of limitations of the board, whereas other&#13;
defaults are borrower driven. Accordingly, therefore, a number of factors were identified as&#13;
causes of loan default from the board's perspective.&#13;
   Board employees were unanimous in their belief that failure to prosecute defaulters was an&#13;
important cause of loan default. Default cases are referred to the state counsel based in Kisumu,&#13;
a town located in another province, because the state counsel in the local district does not han-&#13;
dle civil cases. Furthermore, proper follow-up of clients is constrained by inadequate funding&#13;
for operations and maintenance resources. For instance, transport operating budgets have been&#13;
declining, a situation that does not facilitate consistent monitoring or follow-up on defaulters.&#13;
Chances of default also increase when loan amounts given are lower than the amounts request-&#13;
ed. And the board's institutional structure was described as too rigid and thus not responsive to&#13;
changing client needs.&#13;
   Board members also believe the length of time it takes for a potential borrower to apply and&#13;
get the loan has an effect on the use and repayment of the loan. In the UGLB program, it takes at&#13;
least six months for an applicant to apply and receive a loan.&#13;
   The board also acknowledges that its records on clients are inadequate for efficient program&#13;
management. Although the board has computer facilities, those facilities do not contain appro-&#13;
priate software to process borrower information promptly or to track potential defaulters. Data&#13;
relating to borrowers are manually kept in files and account ledgers, but those files and books&#13;
were found to be too bulky and tedious for the board's sole clerical officer to handle. Because&#13;
basic data on loan repayment are not in a readily and conveniently available format, cases of&#13;
loan over- and underrepayment exist.&#13;
   Regarding loan repayment, default was associated with diversion of funds to unprofitable&#13;
uses, like paying school fees. Other factors included a lack of discipline in the use of working&#13;
capital, poor management skills, and poor business performance. In some cases, defaults were&#13;
believed to be a problem of attitude, with beneficiaries assuming that government funds are&#13;
grants and need not be repaid.&#13;
   The study also found that board members do have measures to deal with various categories&#13;
of default. Cases of chronic default are forwarded to the state counsel for prosecution. Some oc-&#13;
casional defaulters are threatened with sale of their security to recover the outstanding balances,&#13;
and others simply are counseled on the importance of repaying the loan on time. These meas-&#13;
ures have improved loan recovery, albeit marginally. Despite the measures, the board believed&#13;
that the default trend is increasing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factors Influencing Repayment of Loans among Regular Borrowers and Slow Repayers&#13;
&#13;
To establish factors that influenced repayment of loans disbursed by the UGLB, questions were&#13;
posed to both regular and slow-repaying borrowers. The regular borrowers, who made timely&#13;

payments in accordance with their agreed payment schedules, were asked to state what prompt-&#13;
ed them to repay on time; and the slow repayers were asked to state what caused them to repay&#13;
the remaining balance after they failed to repay the loan as scheduled. The study sought to dis-&#13;
cover links between the motivations for repayment and default.&#13;
                          Figure 1.5 shows key factors found to influence board clients to repay on time. As the figure&#13;
illustrates, regular borrowers repaid their loans on time for three reasons: (1) because they&#13;
wished to build credibility with the trade office (46 percent), (2) because they associated timely&#13;
repayment with good business performance (42 percent), and (3) because they wished to get an-&#13;
other loan (12 percent).&#13;
                          The study also was keen to discover what triggered slow-repaying borrowers finally to re-&#13;
pay the outstanding balance. Figure 1.6 shows the stated reasons for eventual repayment of a&#13;
trade loan. It reveals that 55 percent of the slow repayers eventually repaid because of a desire&#13;
to fulfill the outstanding obligation. However, 30 percent repaid because they urgently needed&#13;

collateral deposited at the trade office, and 5 percent repaid because they feared losing that se-&#13;
curity deposit. Issuance of demand notices and improved business triggered full repayment of&#13;
the loan for 10 percent of the slow repayers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Effect of Repayment on Enterprises, Families, and the Community&#13;
&#13;
The study also sought to discover what repayment burdens placed on the enterprise might&#13;
cause default. Responding to study questions, one-third of the study cohort indicated repay-&#13;
ment had no effect on the enterprise. The remaining two-thirds, however, said that repayment&#13;
had led to a reduction in their stock levels. Some said that they were not able to make any sav-&#13;
ings because they used profits to repay the loans. Other borrowers said that they were using&#13;
means beyond business to repay their loans. Some loan recipients even admitted suffering from&#13;
depression as a result of the repayment burden, and they said the depression was affecting rela-&#13;
tionships with customers and was leading to poor business performance. As a result of repay-&#13;
ment, some businesses had closed their doors. Those who were repaying were doing so to main-&#13;
tain trust with the loan office or to avoid prosecution. Some borrowers explained that repayment&#13;
was a burden only when sales were low.&#13;
    With respect to the burden on borrowers' families, less than 20 percent said that repayment&#13;
had no effect on the family. The remaining 80 percent said that repayment reduced family in-&#13;
come and that children's school fee payments might be compromised. They noted that repay-&#13;
ment was expensive because they had to spend a lot more on transportation. The impact of re-&#13;
payment was felt greatly during times of ill health or other emergencies. Some respondents also&#13;
revealed that they sold property to repay their loans. Families who repaid poorly said that they&#13;
lived in fear and suffered psychologically when they saw any government vehicle. For that rea-&#13;
son, they tried to repay so as to maintain a good relationship with government.&#13;
    Sixty-six percent of the borrowers also were aware of the effect of their repayment on the&#13;
community. They said that community members benefited by loan repayments. Some respon-&#13;
dents noted that good repayment encouraged other community members to take loans and start&#13;
businesses that provided needed goods and services to the community. They also pointed out&#13;
that loan defaults cause the community to lose those goods and services and that poor loan re-&#13;
payment makes community members hesitant to take any loans for development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
This final section of the report presents conclusions drawn from the findings and offers sugges-&#13;
tions to strengthen the UGLB and better equip it to deal with the problem of slow repayment&#13;
and default.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
Study findings revealed that default on loans disbursed by the UGLB is strongly related to the&#13;
major source of income. Borrowers' major source of income was found to be the business enter-&#13;
prise, and the predominant cause of default was poor business performance. Therefore, it can be&#13;
concluded that borrowers who depend on their poorly performing businesses default.&#13;
    Timely repayment of loans disbursed by the board, on the other hand, is influenced by good&#13;
business performance and by the desire to build credibility with the trade office. Among slow&#13;
repayers who eventually repay their loans, however, repayment motivations include the desire&#13;
to fulfill their outstanding obligations and the urgent need to reclaim or the fear of losing the se-&#13;
curity deposited as collateral for the loan. To a lesser extent, demand notices influenced repay-&#13;
ment among slow-repaying borrowers.&#13;
    Business performance in this study is viewed in terms of enterprise profitability. Therefore,&#13;
board clients who had profitable businesses were able to repay their loans, whereas business&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                      Rose Ajiambo Bwonya-Wakuloba  19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
losses led clients to default or repay slowly. The effect of poor business performance was con-&#13;
firmed further by the revelations of some borrowers that they used sources of income other than&#13;
their microenterprises to repay loans. This finding indicates that borrowers who lack other&#13;
sources of income easily could default if their businesses performed poorly.&#13;
    Notwithstanding those factors, however, and drawing from the literature reviewed, this&#13;
study observed that loan default averaging 31 percent is high. Sustainable microfinance pro-&#13;
grams, such as the Grameen Bank, were found to have low default rates (roughly an average of&#13;
3 percent). Therefore, reducing the UGLB's default rate is a survival priority for the loan pro-&#13;
gram. Sufficient repayment rates are necessary to facilitate redisbursement of financing, and&#13;
they contribute to achieving the board's objectives.&#13;
    Findings of this study indicated, however, that there is a mismatch between the board's man-&#13;
date and its capacity to handle core functions. It has a small staff whose operations are further&#13;
constrained by limited operations and maintenance resources. As a result, although the UGLB&#13;
has the potential to perform well in providing and recovering government microcredit dis-&#13;
bursements, it lacks the necessary support.&#13;
    This study also concluded the board's manual information systems are inadequate. For in-&#13;
stance, manual recordkeeping is not suitable for effective program management. With the&#13;
records as they presently are kept, the board cannot detect slow-repaying borrowers and poten-&#13;
tial defaulters--a fact further confirmed by the small number of borrowers who have received&#13;
loan repayment demand notices. Although not many borrowers were served with demand no-&#13;
tices, the notices did trigger repayment whenever they were used.&#13;
    This study further observed that not prosecuting defaulters contributed to the rising trend in&#13;
program loan defaults. Therefore, the options open to the board in dealing with either slow re-&#13;
payers or defaulters are ineffective. Default rates are likely to rise and may negatively affect the&#13;
board's operations.&#13;
    The study also found that delays in disbursing funds to borrowers may be as great as six&#13;
months from the time a loan application is filed. Timely disbursement enables a borrower to&#13;
match acquired resources to business needs. With such delays, there is a possibility that busi-&#13;
ness priorities and market conditions will have changed by the time funds are received. That sit-&#13;
uation can lead to a diversion of funds for some unprofitable uses and so to an increased chance&#13;
of loan default.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
This study has found that improving the UGLB's performance is a prerequisite to making it&#13;
more effective in carrying out its mandate and providing technical support to microenterprises&#13;
so as to improve their profitability. To that end, the UGLB should take the following actions:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Strengthen its management information systems to produce up-to-date loan repayment&#13;
        statements for borrowers and to enable early detection of potential default and slow-&#13;
        repayment problems. Doing so will help the board take quick follow-up actions, such as&#13;
        providing debt counseling or issuing demand notices.&#13;
    2. Strengthen its staff by enhancing the capacity of its computer applications. This will en-&#13;
        able optimal use of the available computer facilities, speed up loan processing, and en-&#13;
        sure timely disbursements.&#13;
    3. Intensify its follow-up on borrowers to improve recovery of outstanding loan balances&#13;
        accruing to slow repayers and to prosecute defaulters.&#13;
    4. Revise its borrower appraisal instrument to help identify deserving but vulnerable mi-&#13;
        croentrepreneurs. Vetting should determine how much debt the borrower can handle&#13;
        comfortably, his or her income streams, and any other obligations that might interfere&#13;
        with repayment. Doing so can enable the board to provide the borrower with appropriate&#13;
        counseling and support to avoid repayment default.&#13;

&#13;
   The Ministry of Trade and Industry should take the following actions:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Increase the staffing levels in the trade office to facilitate efficient service delivery in terms&#13;
       of quick processing of applications, disbursement of loans, and monitoring of loan usage.&#13;
   2. Provide to UGLB sufficient resources for operations and maintenance to permit efficient&#13;
       monitoring of borrowers and to cover the expense of prosecuting those who default.&#13;

Corruption Diagnostics: Prescribing a Reform Agenda&#13;
for Indonesia&#13;

This report offers an analysis of the causes of corruption, including social and political causes and those&#13;
arising from markets and their interactions. It introduces a framework for systematic and disciplined&#13;
analysis of these causes to help identify principal factors contributing to corruption and those factors lead-&#13;
ing to it. Corruption in this framework is analyzed as a function of high rent and low risk--each a com-&#13;
posite of various factors that are analyzed to identify the primary root of corruption. This framework is&#13;
suitable for use by policy planners who can allocate resources judiciously to tackle the problem of corrup-&#13;
tion and obtain maximum benefit from their investment in development. The report specifically addresses&#13;
the case of Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Public corruption, defined as the misuse of public office for private gain, is a major issue in the&#13;
world. Although some people have argued that corruption may be beneficial in that corrupt&#13;
practices "grease the wheels of commerce" and that bribes provide an incentive for government&#13;
employees to work harder, the more prevalent opinion is that corruption is detrimental to&#13;
growth and development because it results in economic distortions and inefficiency (Kaufmann&#13;
and Wei 1999; Mauro 1995; Shleifer and Vishny 1993).&#13;
   The economic losses caused by corruption are significant. The World Bank estimates that&#13;
more than $1 trillion is paid in bribes each year. This figure excludes losses from embezzlement&#13;
of public funds and theft of public assets (World Bank n.d.). In addition to such obvious and im-&#13;
mediate losses, there are latent and lingering economic costs. Mauro (1995) found that corrup-&#13;
tion results in lower investments, and thereby lowers economic growth. In a study of 94 coun-&#13;
tries, an increase in corruption averaging 2.38 points on a 10.0-point scale would decrease a&#13;
country's annual investment by 4.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and would de-&#13;
crease annual growth of GDP per capita by 0.5 percent (USAID 1999, citing Mauro 1995). Stated&#13;
more directly, corruption causes poverty.&#13;
   This strong link between corruption and poverty highlights the importance of developing a&#13;
strategic response in fighting corruption in developing countries. The economic benefits are&#13;
enormous, and they redound to the people who need them the most--poor people. Having said&#13;
that, however, we must point out that corruption is a complex problem. There are no easy solu-&#13;
tions to poverty, and most countries that aspire to eradicate it have to take into account severe&#13;
time, resource, and political constraints.&#13;
   In a 2005 Harvard University lecture, Lawrence Summers noted that, in developing economies,&#13;
the higher the stakes and the tighter the constraints, the greater the need for a strategic and&#13;

&#13;
methodologic approach. In this report, that is the need we seek to address. We present a frame-&#13;
work that can be used in analyzing the causes of corruption and prescribing a suitable policy re-&#13;
sponse. The framework, "Corruption Diagnostics," aims to provide a structure and methodolo-&#13;
gy for diagnosing the causes of corruption--a diagnosis that is crucial in formulating the&#13;
appropriate policy response.&#13;
   Another objective of this study is to analyze corruption in Indonesia. We chose Indonesia as&#13;
our case country for two reasons: First, the Indonesian government recently launched a reform&#13;
program, supported by the World Bank, that is aimed at fighting corruption, and we would like&#13;
to contribute to this effort. Second, corruption in Indonesia is perceived as severe and pervasive,&#13;
and is thus a good case example for other developing countries struggling with similar prob-&#13;
lems. Corruption has been cited as the country's binding constraint to growth (Austria et al.&#13;
2005), the root of all its problems (Hofman, Rodrick-Jones, and Thee 2004), and the reason why&#13;
Indonesia fell prey to the 1997 Asian Crisis and is a laggard among its peers in recovering from&#13;
the crisis (Stern 2003).&#13;
   Evidence of the severity of corruption is compelling. In 1995, Indonesia ranked as the most&#13;
corrupt country in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index; since then, it&#13;
consistently has been ranked among the 10 most corrupt countries, with a score below 3 on a 10-&#13;
point scale. According to the Global Corruption Barometer (TI 2005), most national institutions&#13;
within Indonesia are perceived to be largely corrupt, with political parties, the parliament, the&#13;
judiciary, and the police system featuring among the most corrupt institutions. The report on&#13;
the investment climate and productivity study for Indonesia, prepared jointly by the Asian De-&#13;
velopment Bank and the World Bank, highlighted the fact that corruption is a primary area of&#13;
concern, deterring economic and social development and undermining growth by distorting&#13;
the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundations of the society (ADB 2005).&#13;
   This report will be structured as follows: we will discuss the Corruption Diagnostics frame-&#13;
work in the second section, our analysis of Indonesia in the third section, our policy recommen-&#13;
dations in the fourth section, and our conclusions at the end.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Corruption Diagnostics Framework&#13;
&#13;
We posit that, in many ways, analyzing the primary roots of corruption is similar to analyzing&#13;
the binding constraints to growth. Both corruption and growth involve multiple and sometimes&#13;
endogenous variables. Factors determining the levels of corruption and growth are both time&#13;
specific and country specific. Corruption strategies, similar to growth strategies, should be tai-&#13;
lored to local circumstances and constraints. The framework for analyzing corruption therefore&#13;
can benefit by drawing from the rich body of literature on analyzing growth.&#13;
   With that in mind, as we designed our framework we referred to literature on growth, espe-&#13;
cially to the work on growth diagnostics by Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco. In particular, we&#13;
derived a stylized model similar to the one they presented (2005, pp. 5­7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Model&#13;
&#13;
An economy that suffers from corruption is characterized by conflicting social and personal re-&#13;
turns. Individuals try to maximize their personal returns, but their efforts result in a distortion&#13;
within the various sectors and cause a decrease in the net societal return. The difference be-&#13;
tween the returns to the individual and those to the society can be said to be the loss or waste re-&#13;
sulting from corruption.&#13;
   Let this loss be denoted by µ = {µ1, µ2, . . . , µk}, where µi represents the loss from corrupt ac-&#13;
tivity i. The sequence of the corrupt practice can now be represented by the equation&#13;
&#13;
                                    ri (µ,...)=ri (µ,...)+µi,&#13;
                                       p             s                                          (2.1)&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                          Carolina Pandang Austria and Pratibha Krishnamurthy   23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in which ri (µ, . . .) and ri (µ, . . .), respectively, represent the returns to the private agent and the&#13;
            p                s&#13;
&#13;
society because of corrupt activity i. Equation (2.1) indicates that loss and societal return are in-&#13;
versely proportional to each other, and it results in the following constraint:&#13;
&#13;
                                       ri (µ,...)­ri (µ,...)­µi=0.&#13;
                                          p            s                                                     (2.2)&#13;
&#13;
   Our objective is to minimize µi so that the average difference given by u between private and&#13;
societal returns is minimized. This results in the following equations:&#13;
&#13;
                                L = u ­ l [µi ­ (ri (µ, . . . ) ­ ri (µ, . . . ))].&#13;
                                                     p              s                                        (2.3)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               du                 [ri (µ, . . . ) ­ ri (µ, . . . )].&#13;
                                                      p               s                                      (2.4)&#13;
                               dµi  = ­ li + i li               µi&#13;
&#13;
   In the above equations, li &gt; = 0, i = {1, 2, . . . , k} are the Lagrange multipliers for the con-&#13;
straint associated with each of the interactions with other sectors. The first term on the right side&#13;
indicates the direct effect of the activity j on the specific sector, and the second term denotes the&#13;
overall effect on all of the other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Reform Options&#13;
&#13;
Given the above model, we now consider the options available for controlling corruption:1&#13;
&#13;
   1. Wholesale corruption targeting and reform measures: This strategy implies that corruption is&#13;
       tackled simultaneously in all its forms, and that all losses are eliminated. The strategy in-&#13;
       cludes knowledge of all different interactions that can result by cutting corruption losses,&#13;
       and suitable precautionary measures are taken to avoid any unconstructive effects on the&#13;
       system.&#13;
   2. Targeting corruption to the extent possible: This strategy involves a "laundry list" of reform&#13;
       measures, and all losses expected in a general corruption scenario are addressed.&#13;
   3. Second-best reform approach: This strategy involves selecting specific sectors and cutting&#13;
       losses such that the resulting interactions involve only positive results. The approach&#13;
       avoids partial reform in those sectors that are likely to lead to negative fallout.&#13;
   4. Targeting the largest losses: This approach targets sectors with the largest losses and works&#13;
       on them to make them equal to the next-largest loss and so on, following the Concertina&#13;
       methodology in trade (Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco 2005).&#13;
   5. Focusing on the primary root: This approach focuses on the factor that leads to the greatest&#13;
       losses in the economy and that will lead to the most positive interactions in the society.&#13;
       Identifying this sector requires identifying the primary root, which actually will lead to&#13;
       the largest lj in the Lagrangian equation above. This strategy is expected to be most ef-&#13;
       fective because it avoids many of the drawbacks observed in the other four approaches&#13;
       (which require extensive knowledge about the implications of targeting losses and result-&#13;
       ing interactions), and it avoids the waste of resources and reform efforts. Sector selection&#13;
       will depend on three criteria: (a) the existence of widespread corruption in the sector, (b)&#13;
       the ability of the sector to influence other sectors and positive overall interactions result-&#13;
       ing from targeting the sector, and (c) the existence of institutional weaknesses/natural af-&#13;
       filiation toward corruption in the sector.&#13;

available for reform.&#13;

&#13;
Development of a Corruption Diagnostics Framework&#13;
&#13;
From the model described above, we conclude that the best way to fight corruption is to target&#13;
the primary roots--those variables that contribute most to the prevalence of corruption in terms&#13;
of their extent and the interactive effects they have on other variables. When addressed, these&#13;
primary roots lead to the most substantive reduction in corruption. This conclusion now deep-&#13;
ens our inquiry--what are these variables?&#13;
    Leite and Weidmann (1999) proposed that, if we view corruption as an illegal activity, we can&#13;
use Becker's (1968) theory that the probability of committing a crime depends on the penalty&#13;
imposed and the risk of being caught. We extend that proposition and state that corruption is a&#13;
factor of the rent2 and the risk of getting caught: corruption = f (rent, risk). The rent in that equa-&#13;
tion refers to the uncompensated value extracted from others by manipulation of the economic&#13;
environment--often including regulations or other government decisions.3 Risk is the probabil-&#13;
ity of getting caught, being indicted, and suffering sanctions.&#13;
    The variables rent and risk behave antithetically in terms of their incidence and consequent&#13;
impact. Hence, increasing rent and decreasing risk leads to an increase in corruption. Inversely,&#13;
an economy with lower rents and higher risks of getting caught is more likely to be less corrupt.&#13;
    The dynamics of these factors are illustrated in figure 2.1. In the figure, we observe that the&#13;
factors rent and risk impose different conditionality of corruption incidence on the economy, de-&#13;
pending on their relative levels. Pervasive or high corruption (quadrant II) can be attributed to&#13;
the simultaneous presence of high rents and a low risk of being sanctioned. Such circumstances&#13;
can be seen in many developing countries where natural resources are abundant and institu-&#13;
tions are weak. At the other extreme, the coupling of low rents with a high risk of getting caught&#13;
results in low levels of corruption (quadrant IV). This is the case for most industrial countries&#13;
where adequate corruption control measures are in place.&#13;
    But what of the dynamics in the other two quadrants of the figure? The first situation occurs&#13;
in countries that have low rents but do not have the systemic arrangements necessary to deal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2. We argue that rent and penalty are equivalent, with rent equal to penalty with a positive sign.&#13;
    3. Rent seeking is a term coined, or at least popularized in political economy, by the economist Gordon&#13;
Tullock. It is defined as the use of resources to bring about an unfair transfer of goods to oneself as a result&#13;
of a favorable decision on some public policy.&#13;

with corruption. A developing country that discovers natural resources illustrates this point.&#13;
With the discovery of natural resources, the associated rents in the economy increase. In the first&#13;
few years after resource discovery, the incidence of corruption is high because mechanisms to&#13;
control it have not been instituted. When the country develops those mechanisms, it moves&#13;
from the high-rent/low-risk quadrant (III) to the high-rent/high-risk quadrant (I). Figure 2.2 il-&#13;
lustrates this developmental path by the arrow moving from quadrant III to quadrant I.&#13;
   The best development scenario is for a country to avoid quadrant II altogether and to move&#13;
directly to quadrants I and IV. That can be accomplished by attaining a good understanding of&#13;
the causes of corruption and the mechanisms to fight it and by setting up adequate systemic and&#13;
institutional arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Determinants of Corruption&#13;
&#13;
We extend the Becker corruption function, corruption = f (rent, risk), to identify more specific de-&#13;
terminants of corruption. Although it is difficult to make an exhaustive list of all the determinants,&#13;
the literature on corruption identifies some of the more important variables. First, the level of rent&#13;
is determined by the abundance of natural resources and the nature and structure of the econo-&#13;
my. The level of rent is higher in economies that are rich in natural resources, less open to trade,&#13;
less integrated with the international economy, and dominated by monopolies or oligopolies.&#13;
Second, the level of risk is determined by a country's incidence of political transition, its value&#13;
system, and the quality and performance of its institutions. We discuss each of these determi-&#13;
nants below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   NATURAL RESOURCES. The abundance of natural resources is an important variable in deter-&#13;
mining an economy's level of rent. The high margin between the sale price and the extrac-&#13;
tion/production cost of natural resources, such as oil and minerals, generates rents that lead to&#13;
aggressive rent seeking. This dynamic is known in the corruption literature as the "voracity ef-&#13;
fect." Lane and Tornell first documented this effect when they noted that an abundance of natu-&#13;
ral endowments leads to increased corruption (Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian 2003, citing&#13;
Lane and Tornell 1996).&#13;
   Additional empirical support was provided by Leite and Weidmann (1999), who noted that&#13;
the extent of corruption depends on natural resource abundance, government policies, and the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26    Corruption Diagnostics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
concentration of bureaucratic power. Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003) lent further support&#13;
when they posited that natural resources have a seriously detrimental impact on the quality of&#13;
domestic institutions and that the relationship is nonlinear (that is, endowments corrupt, and&#13;
excess endowments corrupt more excessively).&#13;
    We also note that Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003) found that "while theoretical mod-&#13;
els would suggest that all natural resources have similar effects in terms of their instability and&#13;
overvaluation effects, the impact of different natural resources on institutional quality could be&#13;
very different. In particular, oil and minerals give rise to massive rent in a way that food or agri-&#13;
cultural resources do not" (p. 9). Those authors refer to Isham et al. (2003), who labeled these re-&#13;
sources as "point source" natural resources and who suggested that "what is detrimental to eco-&#13;
nomic and political institutions is the lobbying for and allocation of the rents associated with&#13;
such resources" (Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian 2003, p. 9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY. In general, countries that are more open and better&#13;
integrated with the outside economy have lower levels of rent because openness and integra-&#13;
tion force the country to adopt the same level of transparency as that practiced by its trade part-&#13;
ners or investors. That hypothesis is supported by Krueger (1974), who noted that "evidence&#13;
suggests that the value of rents associated with import licenses can be relatively large . . . [and]&#13;
welfare cost of quantitative restrictions equals that of their tariff equivalents plus the value of&#13;
the rents" (p. 301). Bhagwati (1982) wrote that trade restrictions generate a significant amount of&#13;
rents and rent-seeking activities, and Leite and Weidmann (1999) argued that the "degree of&#13;
openness is an important factor in determining the level of rent-seeking activities or the extent&#13;
of corruption" (p. 7).&#13;
    Based on microeconomic theory, we note that markets dominated by monopolies and oli-&#13;
gopolies--which can be private or public (as in the case of state-owned enterprises)--tend to&#13;
have higher levels of rent. Monopolies and oligopolies tend to increase rent to protect their busi-&#13;
ness interests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    INCIDENCE OF POLITICAL TRANSITION. The Shleifer-Vishny (1993) framework postulates that a&#13;
strong central authority with longer-term reign is more often associated with lower corruption&#13;
than are decentralized regimes. A single monopoly bribe taker is more efficient in distribution of&#13;
rents and is more likely to ensure that revenues are maximized. Thus, a shift from autocratic to&#13;
democratic or from centralized to decentralized government results in more uncertainties, in-&#13;
stability, and corruption. The transition and the formation of different sets of institutions create&#13;
uncertainty and leave gaps in the system that lower the risk of getting caught.&#13;
    The very fact that a country undergoes significant political transition implies that the proba-&#13;
bility of corruption increases. Transitions effected after a certain period of time has allowed the&#13;
older regime to take root and influence governance and administrative systems increase this&#13;
probability, especially if the transition is from an authoritarian to a democratic regime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    VALUE SYSTEMS. A society's value system significantly determines the risk of getting caught.&#13;
Some societies--such as those that place a high premium on honesty, hard work, and integrity--&#13;
have low tolerance for corrupt activities. Conversely, societies that value compassion and mercy&#13;
over justice and fairness, and societies that have experienced corruption or have struggled with&#13;
poverty for so long that the people are conditioned to view corruption as a norm or as an accept-&#13;
able means to get out of poverty, tend to be more lax in enforcing rules against corruption.&#13;
    We can surmise that societies that tend toward individualism over community relations and&#13;
conformity would be less tolerant of corruption. Corrupt officials therefore have a higher risk of&#13;
getting caught and being penalized in individualistic societies.&#13;
    Value system as a determinant of corruption has been argued philosophically by economists&#13;
and economic historians, such as David Landes (2000), who commented that "culture makes al-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       Carolina Pandang Austria and Pratibha Krishnamurthy  27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
most all the difference" (p. 20), and Amartya Sen (2005), who highlighted the relationship be-&#13;
tween culture in a society and the prevalence of economic corruption and organized crime. Ac-&#13;
cording to Landes, Max Weber first observed that certain cultures--particularly the Calvinist&#13;
branches of Protestantism--defined, sanctioned, and encouraged a work ethic that valued hon-&#13;
esty, seriousness, and the thrifty use of money and time. Protestantism produced a society of in-&#13;
dividuals who are rational, ordered, diligent, and productive, and who value hard work and&#13;
honest trade (Landes 1999, pp. 174­77; Weber 1905).&#13;
    Although there may be no empirical research that directly uses the term value system as a de-&#13;
terminant of corruption, there is research that uses variables closely related to or subsets of a&#13;
value system, including religion, colonial heritage, and the collectivist vs. individualist mindset.&#13;
These variables, which are more measurable and therefore more empirically testable, may be&#13;
considered close proxies for a value system. One example of those studies is the report by Serra&#13;
(2004) who found that corruption is lower when the population is mainly Protestant and that&#13;
corruption is significantly determined by a country's colonial heritage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    INSTITUTIONS. Institutions' quality and performance are important determinants of the level&#13;
of corruption. Broadly speaking, the higher the quality and the better the performance of insti-&#13;
tutions, the lower the level of corruption.&#13;
    A number of studies have supported that hypothesis. Serra (2004) noted that corruption is&#13;
lower in countries where democratic institutions have been preserved for a long time and that it&#13;
is higher where political instability is a major problem. Seldadyo and de Haan (2005), using&#13;
extreme-bounds analysis, found that corruption is determined robustly by the quality of bu-&#13;
reaucracy, government effectiveness, government official wage, the degree of decentralization,&#13;
political freedom, the quality of the judiciary system, and the level of information available to&#13;
the citizenry. Rauch and Evans (1999) found that the "extent of corruption is higher in countries&#13;
in which civil service recruitment and promotion procedures rely less on merit-based consider-&#13;
ations" (quoted in Leite and Weidmann 1999, p. 8). Shleifer and Vishny (1993) posited that the&#13;
"structures of government institutions and of the political process are very important determi-&#13;
nants of the level of corruption. Weak governments that do not control their agencies experience&#13;
very high corruption levels" (p. 1).&#13;
    To facilitate discussion of institutions, we adopt Global Integrity's six categories in analyzing&#13;
the quality of institutions. We use this categorization because Global Integrity4 specifically&#13;
tracks governance, corruption, and accountability in institutions, and because the categoriza-&#13;
tion itself is a comprehensive list of all causal factors of corruption. Here are the six categories:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Civil society, public information, and media: This category refers to the presence and dynam-&#13;
       ics of civil society organizations that can provide checks and balances to the excesses of&#13;
       government, access to information, and freedom of the press.&#13;
    2. Electoral and political processes: This category refers to the holding of and credibility of na-&#13;
       tional elections, the presence of election monitoring agencies, and the accounting for po-&#13;
       litical party finances.&#13;
    3. Branches of government: This category addresses the existence of effective checks and bal-&#13;
       ances among the branches of government and the effectiveness and efficiency of the ex-&#13;
       ecutive, legislative, and judicial branches.&#13;
    4. Administration and civil service: This category refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
       the bureaucracy; and it includes the government's budgeting, accounting, and auditing&#13;
       processes. It also covers whistle-blowing measures and the processes for procurement&#13;
       and privatization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    4. Global Integrity (http://www.globalintegrity.org/) is an international nonprofit organization estab-&#13;
lished by the Center for Public Integrity, Washington, DC.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28    Corruption Diagnostics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   5. Oversight and regulatory mechanisms: This category pertains to four major activities--a na-&#13;
        tional ombudsman, supreme audit institutions, taxes, and customs and financial sector&#13;
        regulation.&#13;
   6. Anticorruption mechanisms and the rule of law: This category analyzes the effectiveness of&#13;
        anticorruption law implementation, the presence and capacity of an anticorruption&#13;
        agency, the rule of law, and access to justice (which includes enforcement of contracts and&#13;
        law enforcement).&#13;
&#13;
   Those six factors operate independently but often in combination with each other in affect-&#13;
ing the level of corruption because they relate to a country's general institutional framework.&#13;
Most of the factors have strongly interactive associations with each other, so it is important to&#13;
analyze and separate them to identify the correct primary root.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Applying the Corruption Diagnostics Framework and Identifying the Primary Root&#13;
&#13;
In figure 2.3 we present the Corruption Diagnostics chart that summarizes all of the determi-&#13;
nants described above.&#13;
   As stated before, corruption is a complex problem. Although the Corruption Diagnostics&#13;
framework proposes a method, there is no specific technique for finding the primary root. There&#13;
are symptoms, however, that can help identify whether a particular determinant is the primary&#13;
root. For example, an abundance of natural resources might be the primary root if the country is&#13;
highly dependent on natural resources, has not diversified into nontraditional products, and&#13;
has frequent intrastate conflicts linked to the struggle for control of such resources. High de-&#13;

pendence is considered a plausible symptom, given the findings of Murphy, Shleifer, and Vish-&#13;
ny (1993) that corruption tends to hurt innovative activities rather than everyday production.&#13;
Corruption puts a severe tax on innovative activities, resulting in the allocation of resources into&#13;
established production.&#13;
   Frequent intrastate conflicts are a good indicator, given that the conflicts usually occur be-&#13;
cause the benefits of such resources are not perceived to be justly or equitably distributed but&#13;
land instead in the hands of a privileged few through corruption and rent-seeking activities.&#13;
The connection among natural resources, corruption, and conflict was summarized succinctly&#13;
by Lujala, Gleditsch, and Gilmore (2005): "abundance of natural resources tends to be associat-&#13;
ed with low economic growth, rent-seeking, corruption, and the deterioration of institutions of&#13;
governance . . . and these in turn increase the risk of conflict" (p. 4).&#13;
   The nature and structure of the economy might be the primary root of corruption if there is&#13;
evidence of a very high black-market premium, low entrepreneurial activity, low foreign direct&#13;
investment, and markets that are dominated by inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or&#13;
monopolies and oligopolies. (Such firms usually are owned or managed by individuals and&#13;
politicians with excessive and sometimes unexplained wealth.)&#13;
   The other variables--political transitions, the value system, and the quality and performance&#13;
of institutions--are more directly observable. Cross-country perceptions indexes may be used&#13;
to determine if these variables are the primary roots. However, that is not sufficient. Qualitative&#13;
analysis of events and dynamics in the country is needed to arrive at the correct conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Diagnosing Corruption in Indonesia&#13;
&#13;
Using our Corruption Diagnostics framework, we analyzed the case of Indonesia. Our analysis&#13;
was from top to bottom as we went from general factors to particular aspects to understand the&#13;
role played by each parameter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Is Corruption Due to an Abundance of Natural Resources?&#13;
&#13;
We found that, although Indonesia is abundant in natural resources, it does not exhibit the com-&#13;
mon symptoms associated with countries afflicted with the voracity effect. There are three argu-&#13;
ments to support this finding. First, Indonesia is not highly dependent on natural resources. Us-&#13;
ing the ratio of net oil exports to GDP,5 we found that Indonesia has the lowest net fuel&#13;
exports-to-GDP ratio, compared with its oil-producing peers (figure 2.4).&#13;
   Second, Indonesia successfully has diversified into other products. In an analysis of COM-&#13;
TRADE data for Indonesia, Austria et al. (2005) found that new export goods emerged over the&#13;
period 1989­98. These exports include nontraditional products, such as computer inputs,&#13;
telecommunications equipment, and electronic integrated circuits. This finding is further sub-&#13;
stantiated by an analysis of the sophistication of exports,6 which reveals that, although Indone-&#13;
sia's exports are not highly sophisticated, the country does not lag behind other countries in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   5. This ratio was based on Sachs and Warner (1995), who used the ratio of primary commodity exports&#13;
to GDP to measure dependency on natural resources. However, there are criticisms against this indicator.&#13;
First, primary commodities such as staple cereals do not have the same effect on corruption as do point re-&#13;
sources such as oil and diamonds. Second, gross export is misleading because some countries, such as&#13;
Singapore, have high gross exports sourced from imports. In our analysis, we corrected these flaws by&#13;
computing net oil exports to GDP for major oil-producing countries. The data are still not perfect, however,&#13;

terms of technological advancement (see figure 2.5). We can infer from this that Indonesia was&#13;
not highly dependent on its resource endowments.&#13;
                                          A review of Indonesia's economic history shows that the country's relatively low dependence&#13;
on natural resources and on a diversification to nontraditional products was not accidental. Hof-&#13;
man, Rodrick-Jones, and Thee (2004) pointed out that Suharto's government actively pursued&#13;
economic policies aimed at diversifying the economy and strengthening the agricultural and&#13;
manufacturing sectors. Doing so prevented Indonesia from experiencing Dutch disease.&#13;
                                          One last study that responds to the question posed in this section is a report by the World&#13;
Bank (2004). It noted that conflicts in Indonesia tend to be related to ethnic tensions and not to&#13;
natural resources. We consider this report to corroborate our conclusion that corruption in In-&#13;
donesia is not caused primarily by the abundance of natural resources.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
Is Corruption Due to Flaws in the Nature and Structure of the Economy?&#13;
&#13;
Using the measure of outward orientation put forth by Sachs and Warner (1995),7 we note that&#13;
Indonesia is open to trade and well integrated with international financial markets. Specifically,&#13;
it is a member of the World Trade Organization and, based on UNCTAD (2003) country reports,&#13;
has not figured prominently in dispute cases as a violator of free trade rules. In addition, its nor-&#13;
malized average black-market exchange rate premium is relatively low, compared with that of&#13;
other countries, such as Pakistan and India (Caporale and Cerrato 2005). The finding that In-&#13;
donesia is open to trade and well integrated with international markets is not unexpected. The&#13;
country's economic history is replete with reform efforts aimed at liberalizing and integrating&#13;
the economy with the rest of the world.8 Therefore, we safely can exclude a lack of openness to&#13;
trade and integration with international financial markets from our short list of possible pri-&#13;
mary roots.&#13;
    The results, however, are slightly different regarding the presence of monopolies and oligop-&#13;
olies. Indonesia's economy does not operate completely on free market principles. Certain mar-&#13;
kets are dominated by private monopolies, oligopolies, and SOEs. This market structure easily&#13;
can be traced through the country's economic history. In the 1970s, the government began to&#13;
promote the creation of heavy industries in the steel, petrochemical, and automobile sectors us-&#13;
ing SOEs. It rationalized that state intervention was necessary because the indigenous popula-&#13;
tion, the bumiputera, did not have the required experience and resources. Such an approach was&#13;
not unique to Indonesia; most Asian countries implemented an interventionist government pol-&#13;
icy to promote industrialization. For many years, the Indonesian government, like other Asian&#13;
countries, supported certain industries over others, worked closely with banks, and favored lo-&#13;
cal firms (Perkins 2004). In the 1980s and 1990s, the Indonesian government sold some of its&#13;
SOEs to private individuals and kept some others with the government. The U.S. Department of&#13;
State (2005) has reported that, in May 2005, Indonesia's government still owned about 158 SOEs&#13;
and controlled prices on several basic goods, including fuel, rice, and electricity. As expected,&#13;
this industrial policy resulted in markets dominated by private and government-owned&#13;
monopolies and oligopolies. The extent of such "control" is shown in tables 2.1 and 2.2.&#13;
    Table 2.1 shows that approximately 20 percent of Indonesia's financial institutions and cor-&#13;
porations are publicly held, with the remaining 80 percent owned by certain families or the&#13;
state. This level of public ownership is significantly lower than what exists in such industrial&#13;
countries as Japan and the United States.&#13;
    The problem of such extensive private ownership is further exacerbated by allegations--&#13;
and, in some cases, confirmed reports--that most of this wealth is concentrated in very few fam-&#13;
ilies, including the family of former-president Suharto (see Perkins 2004 and Stern 2003).&#13;
    Table 2.2 shows that, in the period before 1997, certain sectors, which were deemed critical to&#13;
Indonesia's national interest, were controlled by the government through government agencies&#13;
and SOEs. The powers of these SOEs varied, but they generally provided monopoly power to&#13;
the government because they managed market supply and demand, controlled prices, and han-&#13;
dled all contracts.&#13;
    When the Asian Crisis struck in 1997, this market structure became the focus of attention.&#13;
Economists such as Bert Hofman, Paul Krugman, Dwight Perkins, and Joseph Stern comment-&#13;
ed that the structure made the country vulnerable to crisis (Hofman, Rodrick-Jones, and Thee&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    7. Sachs and Warner (1995) listed five criteria to consider in evaluating whether a country is outwardly&#13;
orientated. Four of the five criteria are (1) maintained reasonably low tariffs and quotas, (2) did not have&#13;
excessively high black-market exchange rate premiums, (3) was not socialist, and (4) avoided extreme state&#13;
control of its export sector.&#13;
    8. For an excellent account of liberalization reforms, refer to Hofman, Rodrick-Jones, and Thee (2004)&#13;
and to Stern (2003).&#13;

2004; Krugman 1998, as discussed in Stern 2003; and Perkins 2004). Perkins went on to suggest&#13;
that Indonesia should move toward a more market-based economy, with more vibrant partici-&#13;
pation from private economic actors and less intervention from the government. Indonesia re-&#13;
sponded to these criticisms and suggestions with reforms. The banking sector was restructured.&#13;
Two significant changes that resulted from this restructuring were (1) the change of ownership&#13;

                                            Pertamina had a full monopoly on the downstream oil sector,&#13;
                                            including both refining and retailing. It controlled the price of&#13;

at banks affiliated with business groups and (2) the entry of foreign-owned private banks. Sato&#13;
(2005) reported that only seven of the 42 banks affiliated with business groups survived without&#13;
ownership changes. In particular, the former Indonesian owners of some of the biggest banks&#13;
were replaced by new owners, most of them foreign banks.&#13;
          The oil and gas sector was not spared either. Pertamina was divided into two agencies and&#13;
its powers were reduced significantly. Responsibility for the upstream sector was transferred to&#13;
Badan Pengatun and the downstream sector was moved to BPH Migas. Pertamina's regulatory&#13;
functions were transferred to a directorate-general of oil and gas, which is part of the Ministry&#13;
of Energy and Mineral Resources.&#13;
          Efforts to reform rice and electricity agencies were not as successful. BULOG's functions,&#13;
structure, and authority remained constant until January 2003, when its status was changed&#13;
from a national agency to a business enterprise in the form of a "general company." In 2004, the&#13;
Electricity Law, aimed at corporatizing and privatizing PLN, was declared unconstitutional, so&#13;
PLN was able to maintain its pre-1997 function and structure.&#13;
          To date, monopolies and oligopolies persist in Indonesia, although on a much smaller scale&#13;
than before the Asian Crisis. Therefore, is the existence of these entities the primary root of cor-&#13;
ruption? We believe it may be a root of corruption but probably is not the primary one. Our ra-&#13;
tionale is as follows: if this variable were the primary root, the reforms between 1997 and the&#13;
present substantially would have reduced the level of corruption by now--but we find such re-&#13;
duction has not occurred.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Is Corruption a Result of Political Transitions?&#13;
&#13;
The three main indicators of a political transition affecting corruption in a country are (1) in-&#13;
vestor pullout, (2) sudden surges in corruption levels, and (3) hesitation on the part of new in-&#13;
vestors. All of these factors are present in Indonesia.&#13;
          The country underwent a major political shift in 1999 when the first democratic elections in&#13;
more than three decades were held. Abdurrahman Wahid ended Suharto's 34-year rule. This&#13;
transition from a central authority to a democratic one corresponded with a decrease in investor&#13;
confidence in Indonesia (which supports the Shleifer-Vishny [1993] theory that uncertainties as-&#13;
sociated with decentralized authority decrease the efficiency of rents distribution and increase&#13;
gaps in the system).&#13;
          To analyze the effect of decentralization of authority on corruption, we considered invest-&#13;
ment and investor confidence in Indonesia. As shown in figure 2.6, Transparency International's&#13;
Corruption Perceptions Index for Indonesia dropped significantly in 1998 and went even lower&#13;
in 1999 and 2000.&#13;

                 Actual foreign direct investment is revealed in figure 2.7, which shows a significant and sus-&#13;
tained drop beginning in 1997 in spite of decentralization. Although this drop could be attrib-&#13;
uted to the 1997 Asian Crisis, which affected Indonesia significantly, table 2.3 reveals that the&#13;
lowering trend was reversed in 2000 and then investment dropped again at the time of the "Big&#13;
Bang" decentralization initiated in 2001.&#13;
                 The problem of low levels of foreign investment is compounded by the fact that most in-&#13;
vestors reported an increase in constraints faced after decentralization (ADB 2005). According to&#13;
the ADB study, firms operating in Indonesia reported that problems related to economic policy,&#13;
corruption, and regulations worsened. The study revealed that taxation was the main issue&#13;
faced by firms, and more than 11 percent of the firms reported that interactions with the tax in-&#13;
spectorate resulted in informal payments.&#13;
                 Table 2.4 shows the results of the 2003 investment climate and productivity study that reflect&#13;
business perceptions since the decentralization that began in January 2001. According to the&#13;
study, one-third of the firms surveyed reported that informal payments increased since January&#13;
2001, although the effectiveness of these payments did not improve.&#13;
                 The arguments presented here indicate that the political transition to a democratic structure&#13;
of governance was associated with a decrease in efficiency in the business sector and is a reflec-&#13;
tion on other sectors as well. Changes in political systems not accompanied by suitable gover-&#13;
nance support mechanisms led to further escalation of problems related to corruption. More-&#13;
over, informal taxation and rent seeking emerged as ways of coping with inefficiencies and lack&#13;
of accountability.&#13;
                 From these findings, we note that, although it is not the primary root, the factor of political&#13;
transition is responsible to a large extent for the existence of corruption.&#13;

Is Corruption a Derivative of the Value Systems?&#13;
&#13;
The sociocultural value systems that define Indonesian society and contribute to or disallow&#13;
corruption are discussed in this section. We focused on three areas--colonial heritage, religion,&#13;
and the collectivist mindset.&#13;
   The colonial heritage in Indonesia is important in understanding the present systems. The&#13;
Dutch East India Company that established Indonesia as a Netherlands colony was primarily&#13;
an extractive entity, with its central focus on natural resources. This type of colonization did not&#13;
lend itself to the development of suitable institutions for governance and hence led to increased&#13;
corruption and malpractice (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001). The lack of institution&#13;
building is reflected in institutions related to the rule of law, justice systems, and civil services&#13;
that are weak and ineffective.&#13;
   Indonesian society is hierarchical, and there are definite levels and obligations of individuals&#13;
in the social structure. Based on the importance given to traditional and family values, Indone-&#13;
sia does not fall within Inglehart's (1997) post-modernization category. Rather, Indonesians&#13;
place more value on family and community cooperation. This value system could explain both&#13;
the high prevalence of and the tolerance for nepotism and crony capitalism that existed during&#13;
the Suharto era (Hofman, Rodrick-Jones, and Thee 2004).&#13;
   According to Dean's (2001) classification of Indonesian society (table 2.5), although 95 per-&#13;
cent of the population is Muslim, there are differences in the way religion is viewed and prac-&#13;

ticed by segments of the population, and these demarcations were reflected during the 1999&#13;
elections.&#13;
    These religious affiliations go against Serra's (2004) and Weber's (1905) theses about Protes-&#13;
tant ethics decreasing corruption. However, the mix also reflects Sen's (2005) view that religion&#13;
may not be the determining agent in growth.&#13;
    Moreover, Indonesia has a fairly well-established civil society sector that helps maintain&#13;
checks and balances and keeps a watch on corruption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Is Corruption Due to the Quality and Performance of Institutions?&#13;
&#13;
Indonesian institutions do not fare well when measured in terms of the 2003 World Bank/Kauf-&#13;
mann indicators of corruption.9 Table 2.6 gives the country's scores for five years during the pe-&#13;
riod 1996­2004.&#13;
    We now analyze various groups of institutions to discern the presence and extent of corrup-&#13;
tion within them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    CIVIL SOCIETY, PUBLIC INFORMATION, AND MEDIA. Civil society movements and nongovern-&#13;
mental organizations (NGOs) emerged in Indonesia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although&#13;
these organizations emerged independent of political affiliations, the government imposed laws&#13;
that required NGOs to declare the orientation of their issues and their financial, organizational,&#13;
and policy dimensions. Since the mid-1990s, NGOs and civil society have worked with students&#13;
and the literate masses to produce changes in the governance structure, especially during the&#13;
transition to democracy. The number of NGOs increased to more than 6,000 in the 1990s&#13;
(Molyneux 2000). The legal constraints on NGOs are not restrictive, and there are minimal reg-&#13;
istration and foreign aid­reporting requirements (Swadaya 1994).&#13;
    Currently, NGOs are associated with a large number of developmental programs, including&#13;
education, health, and the environment, across the country. About 290 NGOs are associated&#13;
with the literacy movement in 10 provinces10 and a similar number are providing support to the&#13;
government's health care programs.&#13;
    Indonesia does well in the area of public information and communication and in freedom of&#13;
the press and the media. According to the Center for Public Integrity's Global Integrity country&#13;
report for Indonesia (CPI 2004), the media is one of the brightest features of the present Indone-&#13;
sian governance environment. The private press aggressively reports on government policies,&#13;
corruption, and other controversial subjects (Freedom House 2005). The government lifted al-&#13;
most all restrictions on the media in May 1998 after Suharto resigned, and the passage of a lib-&#13;

&#13;
eral media law in October 1999 greatly enhanced the freedom of the press. That law eliminated&#13;
all licensing requirements and removed the government's ability to ban publications.&#13;
    Public information is managed through the Ministry of Information (which was closed dur-&#13;
ing the Suharto era), a ministry that is part of the government's development initiatives. This&#13;
ministry also is responsible for drafting laws ensuring freedom in broadcasting that are mod-&#13;
eled on the work of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (CPJ 1999).&#13;
    Given all of that information, we conclude that the media helps rather than retards efforts to&#13;
curb corruption and that the institution is a healthy, proactive agent in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ELECTORAL AND POLITICAL PROCESSES. Indonesia had its first democratically held elections in&#13;
1999. There was a very high voter turnout (93.3 percent), with 49 parties competing for office. The&#13;
successive election in 200411 also had a large voter turnout (84.5 percent), with 24 competing par-&#13;
ties.12 There were no attempts to subvert the holding of elections in either year, although many&#13;
agencies (including Global Integrity) reported that there were many electoral irregularities. Ac-&#13;
cording to a report by the Carter Center (2005), which monitored the 2004 elections, the voting&#13;
was conducted peacefully, although there were some irregularities related to planning, election&#13;
law, and corruption. The anecdotal evidence collected by the Carter Center, however, points out&#13;
that the cases of corruption were initiated by individuals rather than by political parties.&#13;
    The Legislative Election Law also required the creation of a national election supervisory&#13;
committee (Panwaslu), which was appointed to oversee the election process. This committee in-&#13;
cluded members from the police, the attorney general's office, educational institutions, the me-&#13;
dia, and civil society. According to the Carter Center (2005) report, the Panwaslu and the Consti-&#13;
tutional Court provided important oversight of the election process.&#13;
    Global Integrity has highlighted a significant drawback in terms of maintaining accountabil-&#13;
ity: elected officials are not answerable to geographic constituencies and are appointed instead&#13;
by the parties (CPI 2004).&#13;
    On the whole, however, the electoral and political processes in Indonesia are relatively free&#13;
and fair. There are some irregularities, but those are not sufficiently severe to be considered a&#13;
primary root of corruption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL SERVICES. The Indonesian civil service system emerged during the&#13;
1920s when decentralization through the Reform Law of 1922 diversified the administrative&#13;
structure of the municipalities controlled by the Dutch East Indies government and led to the&#13;
appointment and integration of that structure as the Indonesian civil service.&#13;
    In terms of its structure and functionality, however, the civil service framework was less effi-&#13;
cient than those entities set up by the British in peer countries. The structure did not improve,&#13;
and probably deteriorated, under the successive rules of Sukarno and Suharto, which spanned&#13;
more than six decades. As a result, the civil service agencies in Indonesia were ill equipped to&#13;
handle and control corruption and support efficient governance. The absence of a strong and ef-&#13;
fective civil service also compounded problems faced during political transitions because the&#13;
governance system was not able to deal with decentralized authority, and that led to an increase&#13;
in disorder and corruption.&#13;
    The Global Integrity report points out a number of structural flaws in the Indonesian civil&#13;
services that have led to uncontrolled corruption--flaws including the opportunity for people&#13;
to "buy" lucrative positions and contractual appointments, the allocation of benefits according&#13;
to the discretion of supervisors, and the falsification of revenue and development budgets (CPI&#13;
2004).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Some of the main problems with the civil service are the absence of a merit-based promotion&#13;
system, low pay for civil service employees, and few incentives to promote efficiency and effec-&#13;
tiveness and reduce corruption. The World Bank (2003) has reported the presence of informal&#13;
patronage behavior, with top management making discretionary allowances for subordinates in&#13;
exchange for loyalty. This patronage behavior results in an absence of whistle-blowing agencies&#13;
and vigilance committees that otherwise would help keep corruption in check. Global Integrity&#13;
has reported political interference and the cultivation of a conflict of interest in financial matters&#13;
to extract illegal levies and bribes (CPI 2004). Hofman, Rodrick-Jones, and Thee (2004) noted&#13;
that the Indonesian civil service suffers primarily from a skills deficit, centralized decision mak-&#13;
ing, and complex and opaque salary systems.&#13;
    A number of civil service reform measures were initiated in 1999 to deal with existing prob-&#13;
lems. That year, Indonesia enacted a Basic Law on Civil Service Reform that established the ba-&#13;
sis of reform for the country. According to the report titled "Governance Reform in Indonesia"&#13;
(Witoelar 2001), 22 articles of that law form the basis for developing professional and nonparti-&#13;
san civil servants and a decentralized structure for the civil services, and they facilitate estab-&#13;
lishing an independent Civil Services Commission to formulate civil service policies and an ef-&#13;
fective National Civil Service Agency responsible for civil service management.&#13;
    The civil service system in Indonesia is far from efficient and effective, and there are many&#13;
shortfalls and gaps in its structure and functioning that have caused problems of corruption to&#13;
escalate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OVERSIGHT AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS. Although Indonesia has a long way to go to rid it-&#13;
self of burdensome regulatory requirements that delay and restrict businesses, there are regula-&#13;
tory institutions to monitor financial and tax systems and take care of audits and peer reviews.&#13;
Global Integrity indicates that the following offices in Indonesia perform well: national om-&#13;
budsman, audit institutions, and financial sector regulation (CPI 2004).&#13;
    The Central Bank of Indonesia was given independent status through the Central Bank Act&#13;
of May 1999. This independence guaranteed the Central Bank's freedom from government in-&#13;
terference.&#13;

    RULE OF LAW. Agency assessments and surveys that record citizens' trust in government in-&#13;
stitutions have recorded the status of the rule of law in Indonesia as unsatisfactory. According to&#13;
Global Integrity's country report for Indonesia, the level of security felt by citizens decreases as&#13;
one moves away from city centers. The police reportedly are more likely to interpret justice ar-&#13;
bitrarily (CPI 2004). By the World Bank/Kaufmann indicators, Indonesia had an average score&#13;
of ­0.93 over the four measured years 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004. The situation of the rule of law&#13;
worsened considerably after the political transitions of 1998, and the Kaufmann indicator&#13;
dropped from ­0.36 in 1996 to ­0.97 in 1998.&#13;
    According to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer (TI 2005), the police&#13;
system is viewed as the second-most corrupt system (after political parties) and has a score of 4 on&#13;
a 10-point scale. The police system in Indonesia was placed under the president's direct oversight&#13;
starting in 2001--a move intended to demilitarize the police force. According to a description of&#13;
the Indonesian police system given at an open forum of the United States­Indonesia Society, the&#13;
police force is a 285,000-strong organization considered inadequate to manage the country's pop-&#13;
ulation (Masters 2002). The system is still a centralized and nationalized institution, and the re-&#13;
cruitment process is informal and arbitrary. According to Adrianus Meliala of the University of In-&#13;
donesia, the main challenges to reform of the police system are politicization of posts, government&#13;
inconsistency, inadequate budgets, conflicts with the military, and absence of strong leadership.&#13;
    According to Global Integrity and other agencies, the operations of the police system are ham-&#13;
pered by the absence of a corresponding law-enforcing judiciary. Global Integrity also has report-&#13;
ed that the rule of law in Indonesia is weak and ineffective in controlling corruption (CPI 2004).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
    Given these findings, we believe the rule of law is a significant contributor to the flourishing&#13;
of corruption. In terms of defining and addressing the primary root of corruption, however, ex-&#13;
clusively targeting the police system will be ineffective because it won't be possible to bring law&#13;
to its just ends without corresponding judicial interventions. Although the rule of law is a major&#13;
constraint to reducing corruption in Indonesia, it is not the primary root.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    GOVERNMENT BODIES--EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, AND JUDICIAL. Since the democratization of the&#13;
country, Indonesia has enacted constitutional reforms to alter and strengthen its executive and&#13;
legislative bodies. The president is directly elected by the people and is supported by the vice&#13;
president and the cabinet of ministers. The national legislature (the People's Consultative As-&#13;
sembly) was reorganized to comprise the People's Representative Council and the Regional&#13;
Representative Council reconstituted with representative seats for the military, and a new Re-&#13;
gional Representative Assembly was created. A transition toward complete demilitarization of&#13;
the assembly was made in 2004--a shift from the time when the assembly enjoyed most power&#13;
(during the Suharto era this body had a monopoly on authority). These changes reflect a distri-&#13;
bution of power that differs from that of the Suharto era and reveal the nation's attempts to de-&#13;
centralize power and reduce corruption.&#13;
    In spite of many sweeping reforms, however, the executive branch is still considered very&#13;
corrupt, as is reflected both by public opinion and by the court cases filed against members of&#13;
the executive branch but summarily dropped or withdrawn.&#13;
    Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer indicates that Indonesians consid-&#13;
er the members of the executive branch of government among the most corrupt agents, ranking&#13;
them on a par with a corrupt rule of law system (TI 2005). Jurist, a Web-based legal news and re-&#13;
search service of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, has reported that Indonesia's judici-&#13;
ary is subordinate to the executive branch and does not carry through the cases filed in courts.&#13;
    Global Integrity has stated that the executive branch is known to be very corrupt and that it&#13;
follows a system of patronage networks in which higher officials can authorize benefits to their&#13;
employees in return for confidentiality in corrupt practices. Global Integrity has cited two rea-&#13;
sons for corruption in the executive branch: (1) insufficient budgeting for government depart-&#13;
ments that necessitates off-budget incomes and expenditures to pay operational costs, and (2)&#13;
imprecise budgeting for programs that makes large elements discretionary and thus fosters pa-&#13;
tronage networks (CPI 2004). The lack of accountability and of effective justice systems also is&#13;
responsible for maintaining high levels of corruption in the various branches of government.&#13;
    The justice and legal system in Indonesia is based on Roman-Dutch law, although it has been&#13;
modified with indigenous concepts. The system, however, is highly ineffective and corrupt, and&#13;
it is unable to carry out its role of maintaining and meting out justice (see box 2.1). The judicial&#13;
branch was placed under the Supreme Court in 2004, but has not been able to gain public confi-&#13;
dence because of its weak capacity, inadequate training, and interference by the executive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   Box 2.1. Court Costs?&#13;
&#13;
   In 1987, in a Jakarta courtroom, an angry woman hurled her shoe at the judge. The woman, a disap-&#13;
   pointed plaintiff named Mimi, was annoyed at the toga-clad figure everyone called Bapak Hakim (Mr.&#13;
   Judge).&#13;
       Mimi paid a price for that episode: she was jailed for six months for "contempt of court." She lat-&#13;
   er alleged that she'd bribed the judge Rp 2.5 million ($300) to mete out punishment to the woman&#13;
   Mimi was suing. According to Mimi, the judge reneged on the deal, probably because the defendant&#13;
   had paid him a larger bribe.&#13;

branch (HRF 2005). The NGO Indonesia Corruption Watch has noted the existence of deep-rooted&#13;
corruption extending to all areas of the judiciary.&#13;
                    A United Nations Development Programme report pointed out the lack of and need for judi-&#13;
cial independence in Indonesia (Dung 2003). Human Rights First also highlighted the observa-&#13;
tions of United Nations special reporter Param Cumaraswamy, who commented strongly on the&#13;
presence of corrupt practices in the Indonesian judiciary (HRF 2005). Hofman, Rodrick-Jones,&#13;
and Thee (2004) stated that the Indonesian judiciary has become ineffective after being margin-&#13;
alized historically.&#13;
                    According to the 2005 ADB report on improving the investment climate in Indonesia, the&#13;
most severe constraint to increased investment there is the high level of overall uncertainty, es-&#13;
pecially regarding justice, the enforcement of property rights, and the upholding of the law. Fig-&#13;
ure 2.8 shows the degree of uncertainty regarding Indonesia's legal environment, with 45 per-&#13;
cent of the firms surveyed in the 2003 Investment Climate and Productivity Study not believing&#13;
that the Indonesian court systems are fair or impartial.&#13;
                    The present judicial system was carried over from the Suharto era to the present without&#13;
many reform measures being implemented. Although attempts have been made to reform it--&#13;
especially after 1998--it still requires significant changes and reforms that target corruption.&#13;
Some of the main reasons leading to corruption in the judicial branch are the existence of a pa-&#13;
tronage system, the absence of a merit-based promotion system, low pay for employees, a lack&#13;
of incentives to charge and prosecute offenders, and a lack of vigilance and peer review that&#13;
permits extremely corrupt judges to go unpunished.&#13;
                    Because the judicial system is responsible for maintaining checks and balances in other sec-&#13;
tors and is itself highly corrupt and in need of extensive and systematic reform, it is similar to&#13;
other sectors in Indonesia that are corrupt and have weak institutional underpinnings. Its inef-&#13;
fectiveness contributes significantly to increases in corruption in other sectors, notably the exec-&#13;
utive branch and the police system. It undermines the rule of law and contributes to uncertain-&#13;
ty in the business environment.&#13;
                    Targeting the judicial system for reform at this point is likely to garner political will and sup-&#13;
port because reforming the judiciary is considered less threatening to policy makers.&#13;
                    Given the findings reported here, we conclude that a corrupt, weak, and ineffective judiciary&#13;
with a history of suppression and a lack of empowerment is the primary root of corruption in&#13;
Indonesia. Its problems are exacerbated by political transitions and a corrupt and inefficient civ-&#13;
il service. Our assertions are validated by Transparency International's Global Corruption Re-&#13;
port (2007), which stated that judicial corruption fuels impunity and corrodes the rule of law.&#13;

Policy Analysis and Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
In the previous section, we diagnosed Indonesia's corruption, using our Corruption Diagnostics&#13;
framework. The overall results of this diagnosis are illustrated in figure 2.9. As stated above, the&#13;
results indicate that a corrupt, weak, and inefficient judiciary with a history of suppression and&#13;
lack of empowerment is the primary root of corruption in Indonesia.&#13;
   In this section, we analyze the policy options and possible reform measures available to deal&#13;
with corruption. To avoid potential problems, we also look at other countries' experiences in&#13;
dealing with corruption. Finally, we offer some policy recommendations, including specific ac-&#13;
tion steps.&#13;
   Corruption is a complex problem, and strategies for fighting it must include institutional,&#13;
societal, and economic reforms. According to the Office of Democracy and Governance of the&#13;
U.S. Agency for International Development (1999), a reform agenda intended to address cor-&#13;
ruption should include the following efforts:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Reducing the role of government in economic activities to limit authority&#13;
   2. Strengthening transparency, oversight, and sanctions to improve accountability&#13;
   3. Redesigning terms of employment in public services to improve incentives.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42    Corruption Diagnostics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    PricewaterhouseCoopers (Whitehead 2003) stated that, traditionally, there are four focus ar-&#13;
eas for anticorruption drives--(1) societal initiatives to establish a common standard of morali-&#13;
ty, (2) legal initiatives that rely on the effectiveness of appropriate laws and the legal process,&#13;
(3) market initiatives relying on the assumption of market power and "less government," and&#13;
(4) political initiatives seeking to decentralize and increase salaries to decrease incentives for&#13;
corruption. Many countries have adopted these policies in designing their reform agendas.&#13;
    Given these factors, the reform agenda for Indonesia should have the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
    1. It must have strong political support, and its supporters must have the political will to&#13;
        implement specific action plans.&#13;
    2. It must simultaneously address current problems and long-run concerns by building the&#13;
        necessary institutions.&#13;
    3. It must be pragmatic, workable, and inclusive of public opinion and market support.&#13;
        Note that the last point on fostering inclusiveness can be achieved by meeting the needs&#13;
        of the public and by avoiding waste, inefficiency, and the duplication of effort.&#13;
&#13;
    Our policy recommendations for judicial reform in Indonesia must include measures that&#13;
will address immediate reform issues and the long-term objective of significantly reducing cor-&#13;
ruption. To deal with the immediate concerns, it is important to note that the problems of cor-&#13;
ruption pervade most of the present judicial appointments in Indonesia. Therefore, a system to&#13;
make the present structure more resistant to corrupt practices should be developed. Some&#13;
strategies that can be used to develop such a system are these:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Setting up "corruption courts" to provide a more effective and accessible justice system.&#13;
        These courts will deal primarily with cases of corruption. The appointment of judges for&#13;
        these courts will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice or the Supreme Court.&#13;
    2. Introducing merit-based promotion with a clause requiring that appointees secure a&#13;
        "clean bill of health" from the corruption courts. This reform is a major deviation from&#13;
        the current time-based and seniority-based system of promotions, which are prone to fa-&#13;
        voritism, nepotism, and further corruption.&#13;
    3. Establishing a prosecution branch within the Ministry of Justice to ensure that legal ac-&#13;
        tions are taken against corrupt government employees. We note that corruption is high&#13;
        because employees deem the prosecution risk to be low.&#13;
    4. Requiring that judges both prosecute and judge a case following the judiciary model in&#13;
        The Netherlands whereby judges are actively engaged in ensuring justice. This model in-&#13;
        creases the pressure on judges to be involved in the cases, and may be an effective strate-&#13;
        gy for reducing bribery.&#13;
    5. Requiring judges to disclose personal information, such as their assets and liabilities, and&#13;
        subjecting them to close monitoring. Public and media scrutiny and mandatory reporting&#13;
        of personal wealth usually deter arbitrary and corrupt practices.&#13;
&#13;
    Long-term reform strategies to be implemented during the next 15­20 years should be aimed&#13;
toward securing a clean judiciary. These reforms should include planning slow salary increases&#13;
for judges and reframing the system and duration of judicial appointments. To minimize cor-&#13;
ruption and ensure the active involvement of judges in reducing corruption, long-term (15-year&#13;
minimum) judicial appointments are essential.13 A similar set of reforms is recommended for&#13;
the civil services as a next step in reducing corruption.&#13;
    Involving the government, the private sector, the nongovernmental sector, and the public is&#13;
essential when implementing these reforms. The role of the private sector is crucial because the&#13;
public's need for security and stability is of prime importance. The tasks of civil society and the&#13;

media are to generate positive publicity for these reform measures and to make information and&#13;
options widely known to the populace. Public participation is important in creating broad-&#13;
based corruption-monitoring systems and in increasing societal pressure for effective reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
In this chapter, we presented a diagnostic framework for analyzing corruption. The framework&#13;
involves the analysis of corruption determinants based on the associated factors of rent and risk.&#13;
    Our examination of the literature revealed that the presence of high rents is associated with&#13;
the presence of natural resources and with the nature and structure of the economy and its mar-&#13;
kets. The absence of risk (that is, the risk of getting caught) in corruption was found to be a re-&#13;
sult of the country's value systems, a history of political transitions, and the quality and per-&#13;
formance of its institutions. Analyzing corruption within this diagnostic framework established&#13;
a way to identify the "primary root" of corruption so that policy makers can set a successful&#13;
strategy to reduce corruption.&#13;
    We used our framework to diagnose corruption in Indonesia, and found the major causes of&#13;
corruption there to be the judiciary, the civil services, and a recent history of political transitions.&#13;
    Of those causes, the judiciary was identified as the primary root of corruption in Indonesia.&#13;
Corruption in the judiciary has a direct and significant impact on such other factors as the rule&#13;
of law, the executive branch, political parties, and economic stability.&#13;
    We suggested several reform efforts to address that primary root within the existing system&#13;
and over the long term. To deal with the existing system, we recommended setting up special&#13;
corruption courts to handle cases of corruption, introducing merit-based promotions, creating a&#13;
prosecution branch within the Ministry of Justice, requiring judges to prosecute and adjudicate&#13;
cases, and introducing monitoring and measures to ensure transparency and public scrutiny&#13;
within the judicial system.&#13;
    Finally, we believe that the Corruption Diagnostics framework used in this report can be ap-&#13;
plied to other countries to detect the primary roots of corruption and then facilitate the design of&#13;
effective reform measures.&#13;

Unemployment Compensation and the Risk of&#13;
Unemployment: The Case of Argentina&#13;
&#13;
Ana Lucía Iturriza&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This chapter proposes an econometric model to estimate the impact of the unemployment compensation&#13;
programs currently in place in Argentina on the labor transitions of unemployed workers. The author&#13;
considers whether these programs introduce disincentive effects that influence the search efforts of unem-&#13;
ployed workers and thus affect their probability of abandoning unemployment. The report addresses Ar-&#13;
gentina's unemployment insurance (UI), which represents a passive labor market intervention, and the&#13;
Plan Jefes y Jefas de Hogar Desocupados, which represents an active intervention. That plan has the char-&#13;
acteristics of an unemployment assistance (UA) policy. The analysis relies on Argentine household data&#13;
contained in the Permanent Household Survey that Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INDEC),&#13;
the bureau of statistics, conducts periodically. These data are used to construct a panel of individuals who&#13;
were unemployed in October 2002 and remained active in the labor force in May 2003. The data support&#13;
identification of insured and assisted workers. They contain information on transitions between unem-&#13;
ployment and employment and on the duration of unemployment periods. Other individual characteris-&#13;
tics identified from the data include demographic variables, level of education, region of residence, and&#13;
characteristics of the last occupation. In line with the literature on unemployment compensation, this&#13;
study's empirical strategy consists of applying binary logit models to analyze the effects of UI and UA on&#13;
the probability of moving from unemployment to employment. Likewise, the Cox proportional hazards&#13;
model is used to estimate the effect of UI and UA on the duration of unemployment periods. The Kaplan-&#13;
Meier estimator also is computed for a nonparametric analysis of the events. To address the specifics of the&#13;
Argentine case, the analysis is performed for two different scenarios. The first scenario (classification 1)&#13;
considers beneficiaries of Plan Jefes to be employed, whereas the second scenario (classification 2) treats&#13;
these beneficiaries as unemployed. For the first scenario, UA appears to be an efficient instrument that fa-&#13;
vors the move from unemployment to employment and does not introduce disincentive effects. Results of&#13;
the logit and Cox models consistently show that assistance participants and applicants exhibit a greater&#13;
likelihood of transitioning to employment and have shorter periods of unemployment that follow from&#13;
their higher hazards to employment. In the second scenario, strong demotivating effects associated with&#13;
the use of the assistance program cast doubts about the efficiency of the instrument as an engine for em-&#13;
ployment. According to logit and Cox models, unemployed workers who receive assistance face signifi-&#13;
cantly lower probabilities of becoming employed and lower hazards to employment that translate into&#13;
longer periods of unemployment. Disincentive effects on job-search efforts also are worrisome because as-&#13;
sistance benefits are granted on an unlimited basis. The use of UI was not found to affect the employment&#13;
behavior of participating workers. That result is similar in both classifications analyzed and follows from&#13;
the low significance that the variable exhibited in logit and Cox models. This suggests that there are no&#13;
disincentive effects associated with the use of UI.&#13;

50     Unemployment Compensation and the Risk of Unemployment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since 1990, Argentina has experienced poor labor market outcomes. Among other trends, the&#13;
distressing increase of open unemployment stands out. Between 1990 and 2003, the number of&#13;
unemployed workers tripled, reaching more than 2.7 million (20 percent of the active popula-&#13;
tion) in 2003.1 Successive administrations have used different passive and active interventions&#13;
to protect workers against the risk of unemployment and to offset the effects of income loss re-&#13;
sulting from unemployment.2&#13;
    Among passive policies, the most comprehensive program currently in place is unemploy-&#13;
ment insurance (UI). Created in 1991, it provides monthly income to unemployed workers pre-&#13;
viously engaged in the formal sector and able to show contributions to the social security sys-&#13;
tem. The amount of the benefit and the length of the entitlement differ from case to case,&#13;
depending on individual labor paths. The number of insured workers peaked in 2002, surpass-&#13;
ing 200,000.&#13;
    Among active interventions, the most significant program is the program for unemployed&#13;
heads of household (Plan Jefes y Jefas de Hogar Desocupados, hereafter Plan Jefes), which has&#13;
been in place since 2002.3 It consists of a monthly allowance for every household head who re-&#13;
ports being unemployed. The benefit is granted on a flat-rate basis, and the benefit duration is&#13;
unlimited. Participants may receive the benefit as a subsidy,4 or it may be conditional on a labor&#13;
contribution (counterpart of work) that typically assumes the form of a communitarian job. For&#13;
most beneficiaries, the counterpart represents their main labor activity and the benefit repre-&#13;
sents their main source of income. By 2002, 84 percent of the almost 2 million unemployed peo-&#13;
ple registered in Plan Jefes received conditional benefits.5&#13;
    The Argentine system of unemployment compensation is dominated by two main programs:&#13;
(1) the standard UI and (2) the relatively more recent unemployment assistance (UA). Although&#13;
a number of investigators have studied various aspects of the active and passive policies, the ef-&#13;
fects of unemployment benefits on the incidence and duration of unemployment have not been&#13;
examined fully. It is likely that interventions of such magnitude must affect several aspects of&#13;
the economy and, fundamentally, aspects related to labor market composition.&#13;
    Economic theory hypothesizes that unemployment compensation may have a harmful effect&#13;
on employment-seeking behavior, with high benefits causing unemployed people to be unwill-&#13;
ing to accept jobs (Atkinson and Micklewright 1991). The general consensus is that there is a&#13;
positive relationship between benefits and unemployment, and this relationship has become the&#13;
standard prediction in labor economics.&#13;
    Several investigators have tested that prediction. In countries belonging to the Organisation&#13;
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the generalized use of UI prompted the&#13;
writing of numerous reports analyzing the effects of UI benefits on unemployment. From the&#13;
early studies of Katz and Meyer (1988) until the investigation by Kuhn and Riddell (2006), UI&#13;
has been a topical issue. Evidence concerning UA has been slower in coming and the literature&#13;

    2. Passive policies consist of a transfer of resources to support the level of income of the unemployed.&#13;
Active interventions pursue two objectives: (1) to increase the labor demand in adverse conjunctures and&#13;
(2) to improve the employability of certain vulnerable population groups. Active policies are classified as&#13;
direct employment programs when the jobs created are in the public sector and as indirect employment&#13;
programs when the government establishes subsidies or other incentives to foment private employment&#13;
(Beccaria 2001).&#13;
    3. Strictly speaking, the program falls into the category of active labor market interventions and, with-&#13;
in them, into the modality of direct employment creation. In this report, Plan Jefes is considered an assis-&#13;
tance program with work requirements--a "workfare" program.&#13;
    4. The criteria to receive the compensation as a subsidy are not clear in the legislation. Under workfare&#13;
programs, the modality of subsidy generally is valid for people who are not able to work.&#13;

on it is growing. Studies for transition economies constitute an advance in this respect, signifi-&#13;
cantly represented by Micklewright and Nagy (1998).&#13;
   In Argentina, studies have focused on different aspects of the assistance programs. Particu-&#13;
larly for Plan Jefes, Galasso and Ravallion (2003) and Roca et al. (2003) examined the impact of&#13;
the program on poverty alleviation and social inclusion, confirming the efficiency of the inter-&#13;
vention to protect individuals against poverty and indigence. Likewise, the impact of the pro-&#13;
gram on aggregate demand was estimated (MTESS 2002).&#13;
   Less attention has been devoted to the impact of the programs on the risk of unemploy-&#13;
ment.6 The work of Martin Ravallion is an example of research in this area. By applying propen-&#13;
sity score matching methods, his study revealed that, in the early stages of Plan Jefes imple-&#13;
mentation, the rate of unemployment fell by 2.5 percent as a result of the plan's introduction.&#13;
   The absence of research is more evident in the field of UI, so this report tries to fill that gap&#13;
by examining the effects of UI and UA on the risk of unemployment. The main aim is to deter-&#13;
mine whether unemployment benefits reduce recipients' job-seeking efforts and affect their&#13;
probability of gaining employment.&#13;
   Labor market transitions constitute the framework to analyze changes between employment&#13;
and unemployment status.7 The effects of the compensation on the risk of unemployment are&#13;
estimated by modeling both the transition and the hazard rate from unemployment to employ-&#13;
ment, and by looking at how these factors change in the presence of benefits. In duration mod-&#13;
els, higher hazard rates to employment imply shorter periods of unemployment. If UI or UA is&#13;
found to reduce the transition or the hazard to employment, it is an indication of the existence&#13;
of disincentive effects associated with the benefits. In a context in which persistent unemploy-&#13;
ment may damage individual employability, attempts to investigate this subject are relevant is-&#13;
sues for the study of public intervention.&#13;
   The analysis conducted for this report relies on data provided by the Argentine Instituto Na-&#13;
cional de Estadística y Censos (Bureau of Statistics, INDEC). These data are used to construct a&#13;
panel of individuals who were unemployed in October 2002. The data support identification of&#13;
insured and assisted workers, and they contain information on labor transitions as well as dura-&#13;
tion of unemployment periods. Other individual characteristics identified include demographic&#13;
variables, level of education, region of residence, and characteristics of the last occupation.&#13;
   It is important to note that, since the 2002 implementation of Plan Jefes, official statistics have&#13;
been adapted to distinguish between employment derived from the plan (assisted employment)&#13;
and other employment (nonassisted employment). As a result, INDEC periodically presents dif-&#13;
ferent sets of labor market indicators based on alternative classifications of beneficiaries.8&#13;
   Classification 1 relies on a broad definition of employment, and it includes assisted and&#13;
nonassisted forms of work. Plan Jefes beneficiaries are classified into the labor force as em-&#13;
ployed, unemployed, or inactive if they are working for the plan, not working but looking for a&#13;
job, or not working and not looking for a job, respectively. Under classification 1, for example,&#13;
84 percent of the beneficiaries reporting Plan Jefes as their main activity enter the survey as em-&#13;
ployed and remain employed one period later if they are still enrolled in the plan.&#13;
   Classification 2 relies on a restrictive definition of employment, and it includes only nonas-&#13;
sisted forms of employment. Beneficiaries who report Plan Jefes to be their main activity are&#13;
considered unemployed. In this case, most of the participants enter the survey as unemployed&#13;
and the benefit is treated as any other individual attribute.&#13;
   The distinction between classifications is relevant in the discussion of policy interventions&#13;
because each classification implies a different concept of employment. Setting these classifica-&#13;
tions as the two scenarios for computing unemployment, the empirical strategy for this study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   6. A standard method to evaluate the risk of unemployment is to consider its incidence and its duration&#13;
(Galiani and Hopenhayn 2001).&#13;
   7. Inactivity is not modeled in this report.&#13;
   8. INDEC actually presents three indicators but only two of them are used in this study.&#13;

consists of applying binary logit models to analyze the effects of UI and UA on the probability&#13;
of transitioning from unemployment to employment. The study computes the nonparametric&#13;
Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator and applies the Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the&#13;
effect of UI and UA on the duration of unemployment periods.&#13;
   This report is organized as follows: The next section describes the Argentine labor market be-&#13;
tween 1991 and 2003, presents the technicalities of UI and UA, and introduces alternative classi-&#13;
fications of beneficiaries in the labor force. The next section focuses on theoretical background,&#13;
stylized facts, and empirical evidence regarding unemployment compensation. That section is&#13;
followed by a discussion of the econometric methods usually found in the literature to model&#13;
unemployment compensation. Described next are the data set used in this study and the statis-&#13;
tics of the sample. Results of the regressions follow, and the final section summarizes the dis-&#13;
cussion and provides some concluding remarks.&#13;

Argentine Labor Market and Unemployment Benefits&#13;
&#13;
According to the labor indicators, the decade of the 1990s denoted a major decline in the condi-&#13;
tions of the Argentine labor market. There was poor employment performance and an increase&#13;
in all forms of labor underutilization: unemployment, underemployment, and informal work.&#13;
Table 3.1 presents the basic indicators for selected years.&#13;
   Between 1991 and 2003, the number of unemployed people tripled while employment ex-&#13;
panded only 20 percent. The weakness of the occupational situation translated into a fall in the&#13;
level of incomes, and from that point the increase in poverty was immediate. At the beginning&#13;
of 2000, INDEC reported that 28 percent of the households and 38 percent of the population in&#13;
urban areas were below the poverty line. These totals rose to 46 percent and 58 percent, respec-&#13;
tively, by October 2002.&#13;
   From 2003 onward, economic recovery and intense public action led to an upturn in em-&#13;
ployment levels. After four years, however, it is evident that the fracture in the labor relation-&#13;
ships altered the social and economic order to various degrees, in turn provoking different&#13;

needs for intervention. The national programs of insurance and assistance were put in place in&#13;

In an economic context that had changed drastically, Plan Jefes was implemented in 2002. De-&#13;
cree No. 565/200210 declared the need to "guarantee the right to social inclusion to all the Ar-&#13;
gentinean families, having been declared the social, economic, administrative, financial, mone-&#13;
tary, and occupational emergency." Table 3.4 describes the benefits of the assistance program,&#13;
and the inclusive nature of the plan can be inferred from its conditions of eligibility. Table 3.5&#13;

   a. Preliminary information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The plan includes among its eligibility conditions a contribution of labor. This measure, one&#13;
of the main innovations of the program, has sparked controversy in the debate over public poli-&#13;
cies (Roca et al. 2003). People have questioned whether the activities performed by beneficiaries&#13;
should be considered employment. The following section summarizes the debate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Double Classification&#13;
&#13;
As a convention, official statistics in Argentina include as "employed" those beneficiaries of so-&#13;
cial plans who carry out any type of activity to fulfill whatever work requirements a social plan&#13;
imposes (MECON 2003). In the case of Plan Jefes, the adequacy of that criterion was carefully re-&#13;
considered by the (statistics) authorities because the large number of plan participants signifi-&#13;
cantly alters the indicators (see INDEC 2002). Distinguishing between assisted and nonassisted&#13;
employment has been recommended.&#13;
   Providing a counterpart of work (as required of plan beneficiaries wishing to receive unem-&#13;
ployment assistance) may differ from occupying a job or engaging in a productive activity (Mó-&#13;
dolo 2004). According to the terms of the regulation, plan benefits are intended to compensate&#13;
for the lack of income in a transitory situation of unemployment, not to serve as a normal job&#13;
wage in the modern sense (Pellegrini et al. 2003).&#13;
   There is also a theoretical reason for distinguishing between assisted and nonassisted em-&#13;
ployment. The literature differentiates regular from marginal jobs: regular jobs are full-time, im-&#13;
ply an expectation of continued employment, and are covered by statutory employment protec-&#13;
tion; marginal jobs lack one or more of those attributes. Regular and marginal jobs are associated&#13;
with different patterns of transition between labor market states (Atkinson and Micklewright&#13;
1991).&#13;
   Because the characteristics of beneficiaries' labor activities vary widely, it would complicate&#13;
this analysis to include all of those activities in the category of regular jobs. INDEC computes&#13;
and presents two sets of indicators that this study uses. The report terms these sets "classifica-&#13;

Theoretical Background&#13;
&#13;
Stylized Facts&#13;
&#13;
The economics of unemployment compensation predict that the effects derived from introduc-&#13;
ing payment programs for unemployed people are many and they do not always converge.&#13;
Vodopivec (2004a) explained that the benefits change the opportunity cost of leisure and may&#13;
affect employment decisions, labor force participation, and unemployment. UI and UA may in-&#13;
fluence job-search intensity, postunemployment wages, the labor supply of other family mem-&#13;
bers, and the choice between regular and informal work.&#13;
    How job-search intensity and postunemployment wages are affected can be determined by&#13;
the wage-search model proposed by Mortensen in 1986. That framework described the behavior&#13;
of a representative unemployed worker looking for a job in a decentralized labor market. With&#13;
imperfect information about the locations of available jobs and their associated wages, the job&#13;
seeker goes through an information-gathering process that is sequential and costly. The worker&#13;
faces a demand for her services represented by an exogenous distribution of job offers and a&#13;
constant rate at which these offers arrive. She establishes a reservation wage, determined by ac-&#13;
cess to other sources of income (among other factors) and the value of her leisure or home pro-&#13;
duction. (In the context of unemployment compensation, the value of leisure includes the bene-&#13;
fit paid to covered workers.) Given the parameters of the Mortensen model, the worker has to&#13;
decide whether to accept a wage offer or to continue searching. Technically, Mortensen's job&#13;
seeker solves a dynamic programming problem, balancing two flows of income: (1) the income&#13;
from accepting an offer today at a certain wage against (2) the wage improvement over this of-&#13;
fered wage expected from holding out, where the improvement is an infinite stream and must&#13;
be discounted at a rate (Atkinson and Miclewright 1991). An individual will stop searching&#13;
when the highest offered wage in any period is equal to or in excess of the reservation wage&#13;
(Mortensen 1986).&#13;
    One of the implications of the Mortensen model is that unemployment benefits unambigu-&#13;
ously increase unemployment through their effects on postunemployment wages. Benefits im-&#13;
prove the unemployed worker's bargaining position and lead to higher wages and thus to a&#13;
higher equilibrium unemployment (Vodopivec 2004b).&#13;
    For the impact of benefits on job-search intensity, two opposite effects derive from the mod-&#13;
el. First, benefits reduce a recipient's search effort by reducing the costs of unemployment. The&#13;
reservation wage increases and the probabilities of receiving an acceptable job offer fall, thus ex-&#13;
panding the duration of unemployment. Second, unemployment benefits allow a more intense&#13;
job search. This intensity raises the rate at which job offers arrive, thus expanding the probabili-&#13;
ties of receiving an acceptable job offer and shortening the duration of unemployment.&#13;
    Between these two contradictory effects it generally is assumed that an increased reservation&#13;
wage overwhelms an increased search intensity, and that assumption leads to the main implica-&#13;
tion of the model: the higher the reservation wage, the lower the hazard to employment (a func-&#13;
tion that represents the exits from unemployment to employment). Benefits increase reservation&#13;
wages (or decrease the hazards to employment), and workers who receive benefits are likely to&#13;
experience longer periods of unemployment (Mortensen 1986). Conversely, the model predicts&#13;
a falling reservation wage (or rising hazards to employment) as the termination of the benefit&#13;
approaches, which will be monotonic due to the stationary value of the benefits (Meyer 1988).11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    11. Monotonicity is a property of some functions. The function always grows or always decreases, but&#13;
a monotonic function does not show oscillations. In the present case, because the amount of the benefits&#13;
does not change (and they have a stationary value), the reservation wage will decrease monotonically.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56    Unemployment Compensation and the Risk of Unemployment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The ambiguity of economic theory makes the context favorable for empirical studies. Tzan-&#13;
natos and Roddis (1998) found that evidence generally has confirmed a positive relationship be-&#13;
tween the generosity of benefits and the unemployment rate. This effect comes primarily&#13;
through an increase in the duration of unemployment rather than in the incidence of unem-&#13;
ployment.12 That is, the availability of benefits does not induce workers to stop working, but it&#13;
does reduce the pressure for reemployment when a worker has become unemployed.&#13;
    To describe the evidence in more detail, it is necessary to distinguish between studies related&#13;
to UI and to UA, and, within these categories, between studies concerned with the dimension of&#13;
benefit level (or replacement rates) and those concerned with the duration of entitlement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Empirical Evidence&#13;
&#13;
A standard way to measure the effects of benefits on the duration of unemployment is to meas-&#13;
ure benefit elasticity (that is, the percentage increase in the duration of unemployment resulting&#13;
from a given percentage increase in the benefit replacement rate) and duration elasticity (which&#13;
similarly relates the duration of unemployment to the potential duration of benefits) (Vodo-&#13;
pivec 2004b).&#13;
    OECD countries have looked mainly at the effects of UI, and the results are far from robust&#13;
(Atkinson and Miclewright 1991). The Employment Outlook (OECD 1991) reported that studies&#13;
for the United Kingdom and the United States have estimated that a 1.0 percent increase in the&#13;
benefit level increases the duration of unemployment by 0.6­1.0 percent. To the contrary, how-&#13;
ever, Arranz and Muro (2004) stated that a number of studies found UI to have no effect on un-&#13;
employment duration. Those authors cited Germany, The Netherlands, and the United States as&#13;
examples of null effects.&#13;
    In the United States, duration elasticity was found to be in the range of 0.4­0.5, meaning that&#13;
a one-week increase in the potential entitlement duration is associated with a 1.0­1.5-day in-&#13;
crease in the average recipient unemployment period (Katz and Meyer 1988).&#13;
    In Poland, recipients in early stages of the 12-month period of entitlement have shown a haz-&#13;
ard that is 77 percent lower than the hazard of nonrecipients. When the expiration of benefits&#13;
approached, however, the results reversed and recipients exhibited higher hazards than did&#13;
noncovered unemployed workers (Adamchick 1999).&#13;
    The literature on UA is scarce (Arranz and Muro 2004). Those authors, reporting studies for&#13;
transition economies, found that UA levels discouraged the search effort of unemployed work-&#13;
ers in Hungary, and that the effect of UA was null in Romania. For the Czech Republic and Ro-&#13;
mania, they reported that the duration of UA produced a disincentive effect on the hazards to&#13;
employment. Also reporting on Hungary, Micklewright and Nagy (1998) found that unemploy-&#13;
ment appeared rather inelastic to changes in benefits.&#13;
    In sum, the evidence concerning UI is abundant and the studies generally but not exclusive-&#13;
ly have found that unemployment benefits produce disincentive effects on job-search efforts. In-&#13;
formation about UA is more belated and embryonic, with much yet to be reported.&#13;
    Despite the mixed reports, theory has achieved a certain consensus and the findings of La-&#13;
yard, Nickell, and Jackman (1991) generally are taken as a summary of the state of the art (Calm-&#13;
fors and Holmlund 2000; Vodopivec 2004b). Layard, Nickell, and Jackman stated that the elas-&#13;
ticity of the expected duration of unemployment with respect to benefits is generally in the&#13;
range of 0.2­0.9, depending on the conditions of the labor market and the country concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    12. Duration of unemployment, rate of unemployment, and inflow to unemployment are related by&#13;
definition. In a given population of labor force participants, the steady-state fraction of people who are un-&#13;
employed is equal to the product of the average frequency (inflow) and duration of unemployment peri-&#13;
ods (Mortensen 1986).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                              Ana Lucía Iturriza    57&#13;

The positive relationship between unemployment benefits and unemployment duration has be-&#13;
come the standard prediction in labor economics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Econometric Methods&#13;
&#13;
Nonparametric Approach&#13;
&#13;
Regarding the empirical strategies used to measure the disincentive effects of unemployment&#13;
compensation, the published reports were guided by the availability of panel data to follow la-&#13;
bor transitions through successive rounds of observation. Departing from the two-state model&#13;
of employment and unemployment, most of the studies started by applying nonparametric&#13;
methods to determine the pattern of exits from unemployment relative to time. That determina-&#13;
tion is usually done on the basis of a hazard function.&#13;
   Hazard functions relate each individual in the population at risk with the probability that an&#13;
event will occur in a given interval (provided that it has not occurred before the beginning of the&#13;
interval) (Pollmann-Schult and Buchel 2005). In the case of unemployment duration models, the&#13;
present study computed, in each period, the number of workers whose unemployment periods&#13;
ended (failures) and related those numbers to the number of individuals who continued to be&#13;
unemployed (censored). This method relies on the idea that estimates are affected when some of&#13;
the lifetimes are unavailable because the corresponding items have been lost to observation or&#13;
their lifetimes are still in progress when the data are analyzed. Such items cannot simply be ig-&#13;
nored because they tend to be longer-lived than the average (Kaplan 1983).&#13;
   Formally, the probability that a period of unemployment lasts until period t can be repre-&#13;
sented in terms of a cumulative distribution function:&#13;
&#13;
                                              F(t) = Pr(T  t).                                                   (3.1)&#13;
&#13;
This cumulative distribution function has an associated probability distribution function:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 f(t) = dF(t).                                                   (3.2)&#13;
                                                          dt&#13;
&#13;
To analyze the permanence of individuals in unemployment, a survival function can be con-&#13;
structed with the complement of the primitive function:&#13;
&#13;
                                         S(t) = 1­ F(t) = Pr(T &gt; 5).                                             (3.3)&#13;
&#13;
The hazard function can be written in terms of its definition, the probability of verifying&#13;
the risk:&#13;
&#13;
                                                 f(t)                                                            (3.4)&#13;
                                         l(t)=       = ­  d(ln S(t)).13&#13;
                                                S(t)         dt&#13;
&#13;
   The KM estimator (INEI 2000) is an empirical instrument to operationalize the hazard rate,&#13;
which can be computed as&#13;
&#13;
                                   S(t) =  (ni ­ hi) / ni =i= (1 ­ li),&#13;
                                            n                    n&#13;
                                                                                                                 (3.5)&#13;
                                           i=1                    1&#13;
&#13;
where hi is the number of completed unemployment periods and ni is the number of ongoing&#13;
periods in period t.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   13. By properties of derivatives, ­ d lnS(t) / dt = S´(t) / S(t), S(t) = 1 ­ F(t), S´(t) = 0 ­ F´(t) = ­ f(t)  S´(t)&#13;
/ S(t) = ­ f(t) / S(t).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58    Unemployment Compensation and the Risk of Unemployment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The KM estimator is a strictly empirical, nonparametric approach to estimating survival and&#13;
hazard functions (Greene 2002). Because it relies only on the observed periods to determine the&#13;
hazard, the estimator implicitly assumes that the population involved is homogeneous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Semiparametric Approach&#13;
&#13;
The KM estimator provides a descriptive analysis of the shape of the hazard function and points&#13;
the investigator to the need for further research. The literature indicates that the assumption of&#13;
homogeneity that is implicit in the KM estimator is a drawback to the estimating process. The&#13;
observation that workers who leave unemployment first may display different characteristics&#13;
than workers who exit later or remain unemployed prompts the use of parametric estimation.&#13;
    To estimate the impact of benefits on survival after adjusting for other explanatory variables&#13;
(or after controlling for observed heterogeneity), duration data are modeled as the combination&#13;
of a baseline hazard and a mixing distribution. The baseline hazard represents structural dura-&#13;
tion dependence, and the mixing distribution represents unobserved heterogeneity (Paserman&#13;
2004). The semiparametric estimation of the hazard function has been done classically with the&#13;
Cox proportional hazards model:&#13;
&#13;
                                          li(t)=l0(t)exp(zi(t)´b).                                (3.6)&#13;
&#13;
    Equation (3.6) expresses the hazard as the product of two functions. The first function, l0 (t),&#13;
is the baseline hazard at time t, unknown, unspecified, common to all individuals, and depend-&#13;
ent on the actual duration of unemployment; it measures duration dependency. The second&#13;
function describes the way in which the hazard shifts at given points in time between individu-&#13;
als with different characteristics. Because of the nonnegativity of the hazards, it is an exponen-&#13;
tial function, where zi(t) is a vector of explanatory variables for individual i at time t, and b is a&#13;
vector of unknown parameters (Karni 1999; Lancaster 1979; van Opstal and Theeuwes 1986).&#13;
    The Cox model does not assume a particular distribution for the survival times; rather, it as-&#13;
sumes that the effects of the different variables on survival are constant over time and are addi-&#13;
tive in a particular scale (Walters 2000).&#13;
    Following Meyer (1995), the probability that a period of unemployment lasts until t+1, con-&#13;
ditional on its lasting up to period t, is given by the following equation:&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  t+1&#13;
                               Pr[Ti  t + 1 | Ti  t] = exp ­  li(u)du ,                           (3.7)&#13;
                                                                  t&#13;
&#13;
where Ti is the duration of individual i unemployment period. If zi (t) is assumed constant be-&#13;
tween t and t+1, then, substituting for li from equation (3.7), we get&#13;
                                                            t+1&#13;
                       Pr[Ti  t + 1 | Ti  t] = exp ­          l0(u)du [exp{zi(t)´b }              (3.8)&#13;
                                                            t&#13;
&#13;
                                  = exp{ ­ exp[g(t) + zi(t)´b ]}, where&#13;
&#13;
                                                       t+1&#13;
                                            g(t)=ln l0(u)du .&#13;
                                                        t&#13;

    To construct the likelihood that the periods are classified into failure (di = 1) and censored&#13;

&#13;
which can be expressed as a function of a finite number of parameters and can be maximized in&#13;
the following manner:&#13;
&#13;
                        N                                             ki­1&#13;
             L (g,b) = S dt log[1 ­ exp{­exp[g (ki) + zi(ki)´b]}] ­ tS exp[g (t) + zi(t)´b ] .   (3.10)&#13;
                       t=1                                            =0&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                   Ana Lucía Iturriza   59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Semiparametric analysis is relevant because the shape of the baseline hazard is often irregu-&#13;
lar and unlikely to be well approximated by a simple parametric form (Meyer 1995). This out-&#13;
come concerns unemployment compensation modeling because irregularities may be caused by&#13;
the presence of benefits that are about to expire.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Parametric Approach&#13;
&#13;
Reports in the literature suggest parametric analysis to model the hazard rate. Equation (3.6) is&#13;
corrected by including an error term with a known distribution to control for unobserved het-&#13;
erogeneity. The term included allows for error in specifying the systematic sources of variation&#13;
of the hazard function due to the omission of relevant regressors (Lancaster 1979). Among those&#13;
authors who have proposed fully parametric analysis, Lancaster (1979) suggested using the&#13;
Weibull distribution to model the baseline hazard and the gamma distribution for the error&#13;
term. Van Opstal and Theeuwes (1986) experimented with Weibull and Gompertz models for&#13;
the baseline hazard and with gamma and log-normal distributions for the error term.&#13;
    Parametric methods, however, are not the most frequently used methods to estimate unem-&#13;
ployment duration because theory does not provide clear criteria to select the correct distribu-&#13;
tion. Rather, the correct distribution must be chosen on the basis of empirical trials (van Opstal&#13;
and Theeuwes 1986). A misspecified baseline hazard causes all parameters estimates to be in-&#13;
consistent (Meyer 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Empirical Strategy&#13;
&#13;
The present study combined nonparametric and semiparametric methods to model unemploy-&#13;
ment duration. This approach follows the existing literature (Adamchick 1999; Arranz and&#13;
Muro 2004; Meyer 1995). For the reasons already explained, parametric methods were not used&#13;
in the present study.&#13;
    To model the incidence of unemployment, transitions across labor market states were mod-&#13;
eled on the basis of binary logit models, an approach inspired by earlier investigators (see Cer-&#13;
imedo 2004).14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Characteristics of the Data Set&#13;
&#13;
For the analysis of labor market issues, Argentina counts on the information from the Perma-&#13;
nent Household Survey conducted periodically by INDEC. The survey retrieves a set of indica-&#13;
tors collected at household and individual levels to classify the people according to their demo-&#13;
graphic structure, their insertion into the process of production, and their participation in&#13;
income distribution (Pok and Lorenzetti 2004). The survey is designed to cover urban areas,&#13;
reaching an average of 25,000 households and 72,500 individuals per round--figures represen-&#13;
tative of 70 percent of the total urban population. It has a rotating panel structure, with 25 per-&#13;
cent of households replaced in each round. Until May 2003, the survey had a semester periodic-&#13;
ity, carried out in May and October.&#13;
    For reasons of information availability, the data set used in the present study is the panel&#13;
formed with the rounds done in October 2002 and May 2003. Although Plan Jefes was imple-&#13;
mented at the beginning of 2002, it was in October 2002 that an extra module of descriptors was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    14. Because logit models have been used extensively in empirical economics, the details of their appli-&#13;
cation are not discussed here. For a full discussion of them, see Greene (2003).&#13;

&#13;
added to the survey to capture information related to the plan. May 2003 was chosen as the end-&#13;
ing point of the study period because it was the last round in which the survey was conducted&#13;
in the manner described. From the second semester of 2003 onward, several aspects of the sur-&#13;
vey were changed in ways that made the survey instruments incomparable.15&#13;
    The data set available for the current analysis contained information on approximately&#13;
21,420 individuals aged 16­64 years who made up the common part of the two survey rounds.&#13;
The databases were merged through a linking variable that concatenated the area of residence,&#13;
the code of the household, and each individual's date of birth. The resulting data set was con-&#13;
trolled and corrected by removing the observations that showed inconsistencies in the variables&#13;
gender and age. Table 3.6 enumerates the survey observations and the valid observations re-&#13;
maining after correcting for inconsistencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Descriptive Statistics&#13;
&#13;
Table 3.7 shows the composition of Argentina's labor market in October 2002, according to the&#13;
classification 1 framework. It displays the distribution of the sample among employed, unem-&#13;
ployed, and inactive groups. It also shows the shares of unemployed people receiving assis-&#13;
tance, applicants for assistance, and insured people.&#13;
    Of the individuals reporting unemployment in the first period, the study focused on those&#13;
who remained in the labor force in the second period, either as employed or as unemployed&#13;
workers. Table 3.8 defines the flows out of unemployment for different groups of the popula-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    15. Among other changes, aspects related to periodicity and survey coverage, as well as fundamental&#13;
definitions, were modified.&#13;

    Note: The level of permanence in the survey is lower than the theoretical 75 percent. The merged subsample repre-&#13;
sents, respectively, 43 percent and 58 percent of the October and May samples. The drop in the number of households&#13;
interviewed probably is explained by the changes in the design of the survey that were already in progress by May 2003.&#13;

tion. As the numbers reveal, the most probable transition out of unemployment was to employ-&#13;
ment. Of the original total of 2,228 people unemployed, 916 (41 percent) moved to employment.&#13;
Likewise, 709 people (32 percent) remained unemployed, and 603 (27 percent) dropped out of&#13;
the labor force entirely. The same interpretation is valid for the other population groups includ-&#13;
ed in the table.&#13;
    Under classification 2, Plan Jefes participants were reallocated with reference to their em-&#13;
ployment status. Those who performed the counterpart as their main activity were considered&#13;
unemployed. These cases were detected in the sample by applying the filters determined by IN-&#13;
DEC (see INDEC 2002).&#13;
    Table 3.9 summarizes the labor market composition for classification 2. Almost all of the ben-&#13;
eficiaries were reallocated to the unemployed group, representing 36 percent of the total.&#13;
    Table 3.10 reveals the transitions out of unemployment for classification 2 individuals who&#13;
were unemployed in October 2002. Half of the unemployed workers remained unemployed--&#13;
1,722 of 3,430 (50 percent). Thirty percent (1,036) of the originally unemployed workers transi-&#13;
tioned to employment, and the remaining 672 (20 percent) unemployed people dropped out of&#13;
the labor force.&#13;
    The descriptive analysis concludes with the socioeconomic characteristics of the unem-&#13;
ployed. Table 3.11 presents the descriptive statistics for alternative classifications. The character-&#13;
istics of the beneficiaries of Plan Jefes are shown as well. The variables, defined in the table, are&#13;

tics of the last occupation" apply only to individuals reporting unemployment. Consequently,&#13;
they are not measured for classification 2.&#13;
   On average, compared with nonparticipants, the group of participants displayed a slightly&#13;
higher age, higher share of females, higher incidence of household heads, and lower levels of&#13;
education. Regionally, they were relatively more concentrated in northern regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Model Specification and Results&#13;
&#13;
The impact of unemployment compensation on the risk of unemployment was analyzed by se-&#13;
quentially considering the two classifications. The regressions focused on individuals who were&#13;
unemployed in the first period and were active in the second period. Transitions to inactivity&#13;
were not modeled in the regressions.&#13;
   Binary logit models were used to analyze transitions, and both the KM estimator and Cox&#13;
models were used to estimate duration, according to the methods described previously in this&#13;
report.&#13;
   The results of the logit and Cox models for both classification scenarios are presented first.&#13;
Nonparametric analysis closes the comparison.&#13;

                                   Pi = E(Y = 1 | Xi) =  1 + e­(biXi),&#13;
&#13;
where the probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment Pi is a logistic func-&#13;
tion of individual characteristics Xi, including access to benefits, demographic variables, educa-&#13;
tional level, region of residence, and characteristics of the last occupation.&#13;
   The dependent variable takes on the value 1 if the individual transitioned from unemploy-&#13;
ment to employment, and it takes on the value of 0 if the person remained unemployed.&#13;
   Benefit-related effects were modeled with UA and UI variables. UA entered in the form of&#13;
two dummy variables, each indicating the condition of beneficiary or the condition of applicant.&#13;
   Given the evidence found in other studies discussed previously in this report, one should ex-&#13;
pect the variable UA_beneficiary to be associated with a negative coefficient, thus reflecting UA's&#13;
disincentive effects on the transitions to employment. In the first classification, however, the&#13;
bulk of recipients are, by definition, transitioned into employment. This job-search behavior&#13;
probably is associated with a need for greater income. We can expect these people to experience&#13;
a positive impact of UA on the hazard to employment.&#13;
   The dummy variable specifying the condition of applicant (UA_applicant) is a characteristic&#13;
of our data set. The precedents for using this variable are scarce.16 Assuming that the expecta-&#13;
tion of a benefit reduces the job-seeking effort, one would expect this characteristic to have the&#13;
same impact as does the condition of being a UA beneficiary.&#13;
   UI enters as a dummy variable that indicates whether the unemployed worker is receiving&#13;
such insurance. A negative sign associated with the disincentive effects of UI is foreseen.&#13;
   Other regressors include sex, age in years, household head and marital status, level of edu-&#13;
cation, region of residence, and characteristics of the last occupation (work experience and last&#13;
occupational category). Although the effect of those variables cannot be fully predicted, one can&#13;
propose some generalizations. According to sociologic theory, individuals within a household&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   16. Ravallion used the difference-in-difference method on data gathered in the May and October 2002&#13;
rounds of the Permanent Household Survey to estimate the impact of Plan Jefes on different labor market&#13;
outcomes. The group of applicants enters as the comparison group.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
differ in terms of their relative responsibilities as income providers. Males, adults, household&#13;
heads, and relatively educated people are considered primary workers, under the assumption&#13;
that they are more likely to participate in generating family income. Conversely, women, young&#13;
people, those who are not heads of households, and less-educated people are considered sec-&#13;
ondary workers (Paz 2003).&#13;
    Studies on transitions to employment in Argentina usually find gender differentials favor-&#13;
able to male workers that are explained by the difficulty that women face in exiting unemploy-&#13;
ment (Ortega 2006). Accordingly, one can expect a positive sign for the variable sex, reflecting&#13;
males' relative advantage in transitioning to employment. The age of the individual is expected&#13;
to be negatively associated with the probability of employment. The tendency to hire younger&#13;
workers (that is, the age discrimination effect) is explained by the training costs that firms face&#13;
for every worker hired. By hiring young workers, firms maximize their recovery of costs&#13;
(Ehrenberg and Smith 1994). Household heads and married people should have greater likeli-&#13;
hood of making transitions to employment because of their roles as income providers.&#13;
    Level of education is a key variable in determining employment outcomes. Empirical stud-&#13;
ies have pointed out that the relationship between level of education and employment takes the&#13;
form of an inverted U (Ramos 2002), linking higher probabilities of employment to middle and&#13;
upper-middle levels of education. One should expect that the level of education in the present&#13;
study will be associated positively with the probability of exiting unemployment.&#13;
    Regional variables should capture the relative conditions of regional labor markets. Greater&#13;
Buenos Aires and Patagonia regions generally display better labor conditions, whereas the&#13;
northeast and northwest regions of Argentina are relatively poorer. Workers residing in those&#13;
latter regions can be expected to show a worse employment performance in the present study.&#13;
    Characteristics of the last occupation affect the probability of employment in several ways.&#13;
Compared with first-time job seekers, unemployed people with work experience are expected&#13;
to display greater likelihood of employment, and that predicts a positive coefficient for the vari-&#13;
able in the present study. The human capital that workers accumulate in jobs explains their rel-&#13;
ative advantage in competing for a job against workers without experience.&#13;
    Finally, the effects derived from the last occupational category (self-employment or salaried)&#13;
are difficult to predict and probably will be related to the conditions of the labor market.&#13;
    The results of the logit regression are presented in table 3.12. The coefficients in the "margin-&#13;
al effects" section of the table report the percentage change in the probability of moving from&#13;
unemployment to employment, given a unitary change in the value of the regressor (Gujarati&#13;
2003). A positive (negative) sign indicates that the probability is higher (lower) for individuals&#13;
with higher values of that variable. Because all the variables are dichotomous (except age, which&#13;
is presented in years), the results indicate a change of the probability in the presence of the&#13;
attribute.&#13;
&#13;

    COX MODEL. The following equation provides an adequate functional form to estimate the&#13;
Cox model:&#13;
&#13;
                                         gi(t)=l0(t)exp(zi(t)´b).                              (3.12)&#13;
&#13;
The survival setting comprises the survival time variable, containing the duration of the unem-&#13;
ployment periods in months, and an endpoint variable, defined to take on the value 1 when the&#13;
period is complete (that is, when the individual has moved to employment) and 0 if the period&#13;
is ongoing and the observation is censored.&#13;
    With the information reported in the survey, it is possible to compute the duration of unem-&#13;
ployment periods by applying these two expressions:&#13;
&#13;
    · duration of unemployment, completed periods = time of search declared in period 1 +&#13;
       time between surveys (six months) ­ duration of current job declared in period 2, and&#13;
    · duration of unemployment, ongoing periods = time of search declared in period 2.&#13;

    Compensation-related variables enter as described for the logit model, as do the rest of the&#13;
explanatory variables.&#13;
    Because of the relationship between unemployment and duration, it is expected that vari-&#13;
ables that favor (harm) the transition to employment also shorten (lengthen) the duration of the&#13;
unemployment period. It is expected that the coefficients in the Cox specification will have the&#13;
same signs as they do in the logit specification.&#13;
    Table 3.12 presents the results of the Cox model. The coefficients report the percentage&#13;
change in the hazard to employment, or the risk of exiting from unemployment to employment,&#13;
given a change in the value of the regressor. A positive (negative) sign indicates that the hazard&#13;
is higher (lower), and thus the duration of the unemployment period is shorter (longer) for in-&#13;
dividuals with higher values of that variable (Walters 2000). For dummy variables, the coeffi-&#13;
cients report the shift in the baseline, given the presence of the attribute. A statistically insignif-&#13;
icant result means that changes in the variable do not shift the baseline hazard function.17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    17. After Cox regressions of the form li(t) = l0 (t) exp(zi (t)´b ), using Stata software provides the hazard&#13;
ratio li(t) / l0(t) = exp(zi(t)´b ). When reporting results, these coefficients are transformed by the log func-&#13;
tion, which means that the coefficients account for elasticities. Given the nature of the regressors in the&#13;
present study, it is more proper to interpret the coefficients in terms of percentage change. For dummy&#13;
variables, the possible outcomes are li(t) / l0(t) = exp(0) = 1 in the absence of the attribute, and li(t) / l0(t)&#13;
= exp(b ) when the attribute is present (which, by comparison, represents the shift of the baseline hazard).&#13;
Equally, a coefficient not statistically different from 0 implies that li(t) / l0(t) = exp(0) = 1 and li (t) = l0 (t).&#13;

&#13;
   CLASSIFICATION 1 RESULTS. Table 3.12 also presents the results of the estimations for logit and&#13;
Cox models of classification 1. The analysis of benefit-related variables shows that Plan Jefes&#13;
beneficiaries, compared with nonassisted workers, experience a lower risk of unemployment.&#13;
This assumes the form of a higher probability of transitioning to employment (19 percent) and a&#13;
higher hazard (71 percent), meaning that beneficiaries face shorter periods of unemployment.&#13;
The dummy for UA is significant in both models, and it displays the results that may be expect-&#13;
ed in classification 1.&#13;
   Having applied for UA produces the same results, although with lower significance. Appli-&#13;
cants display better probabilities of employment. This finding mirrors the fact that part of the&#13;
applicants became beneficiaries in the second period and, hence, were classified as employed.&#13;
   UI is not significant enough to explain the risk of unemployment. However, it negatively af-&#13;
fects both logit and Cox models, which suggests the presence of disincentive effects associated&#13;
with the insurance.&#13;
   The characteristics of the last occupation are generally significant enough to explain the exits&#13;
from unemployment. Unemployed people who have work experience display better job-&#13;
gaining performance than do first-time job seekers. This finding is explained by the behavior of&#13;
unemployed workers coming from self-employment positions and not by unemployed workers&#13;
previously engaged in other occupational categories.&#13;
   Increased age is associated with a worsening in the prospects for employment. Conversely,&#13;
household heads or married workers experience a lower risk of unemployment according to&#13;
consistent findings obtained for the logit and Cox models. These results are typical in labor mar-&#13;
ket analysis and are in agreement with theoretical considerations already discussed.&#13;
   Only residents of the northeastern region of Argentina display chances of being employed in&#13;
a second period that are superior to the chances of the unemployed workers in Greater Buenos&#13;
Aires. Likewise, the length of unemployment periods is shorter in three of the five regions stud-&#13;
ied: northwest, northeast, and Patagonia.&#13;
   Finally, the study revealed an atypical result: sex and education level are not adequately sig-&#13;
nificant to explain the transitions or the hazards under analysis.&#13;
   In sum, between October 2002 and May 2003, job creation favored unemployed workers re-&#13;
ceiving or applying for UA; household heads; married individuals; unemployed workers com-&#13;
ing from self-employed positions; and residents from the northeast, northwest, and Patagonia&#13;
regions. The probabilities of exiting unemployment were significantly lower for older workers.&#13;
   To interpret these results, one should start by recalling that the beneficiaries included in this&#13;
regression are those who reported being unemployed, although they were enrolled in Plan Je-&#13;
fes. Most of them had transitioned to employment by the second period of the study, and that&#13;
explains the positive impact of the variable on the regressions. The same behavior is found&#13;
among the assistance applicants.&#13;
   Receiving assistance turns out to be a key variable in explaining the lower risk of unemploy-&#13;
ment because its influence can be recognized in other equally significant regressors. Looking at&#13;
the descriptive statistics, one can see that 43 percent of Plan Jefes beneficiaries are heads of&#13;
household, whereas that is true for only 32 percent of the total sample. A similar interpretation&#13;
can be made for the regional analysis. With the exception of Patagonia, the share of plan partic-&#13;
ipants living in regions where the prospects for employment are higher is relatively greater than&#13;
the average for the total sample.&#13;
   The low significance of gender and education in logit and Cox models also is related to im-&#13;
balances in the distributions of these variables between plan participants and the total sample.&#13;
The presence of women in the group of beneficiaries is 70 percent, against 40 percent for the to-&#13;
tal sample of unemployed people. Beneficiaries also display lower levels of education: more&#13;
than 50 percent of them managed to complete, at most, only the primary level.&#13;
   Because of the manner in which variables are constructed, it is not possible to make a direct&#13;
interpretation of UA's disincentive effects on employment performance. In any case, it is likely&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                     Ana Lucía Iturriza  67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that UA produced an incentive effect, as is apparent for the partial coefficient of the variable in&#13;
both logit and Cox regressions.&#13;
    With regard to UI, although its impact is negative, the low level of significance does not per-&#13;
mit attributing disincentive effects derived from its application.&#13;
    Given the results obtained in this study in the classification 1 scenario, UI and UA do not in-&#13;
troduce disincentive effects in job-search efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Classification 2&#13;
&#13;
The analysis in the classification 2 scenario was performed on 2,758 cases, 1,036 of which made&#13;
a positive transition to employment and 1,722 remained unemployed in May 2003 (see table&#13;
3.10). In this second scenario, most Plan Jefes participants are unemployed, and UA is treated as&#13;
any other attribute. The disincentive effects associated with such compensation are expected to&#13;
appear in this model.&#13;
    The specification of the logit model is the same as it was in the classification 1 scenario. Be-&#13;
cause beneficiaries are computed as employed in the survey, the descriptors for the last occupa-&#13;
tion do not apply, and the corresponding regressors are dropped from the model.&#13;
    In the Cox model, the survival setting was constructed as it was in the classification 1 analy-&#13;
sis. In this case, however, it is not possible to calculate the length of unemployment from the in-&#13;
formation gathered in the survey. Therefore, it was necessary to impute a period of unemploy-&#13;
ment to assisted workers. Assuming that beneficiaries are unemployed even when working for&#13;
Plan Jefes, their unemployment lasts at least the number of months that has passed since they&#13;
enrolled in the plan. The periods computed accordingly would range between 0 and 12 months&#13;
because the program began in May 2002 and the final observation in our study occurred in May&#13;
2003. Although this method is useful as an approach, it conceals part of workers' labor paths be-&#13;
cause it does not take into account the period of unemployment that beneficiaries registered&#13;
when they enrolled. That period must be estimated and added. The household survey in May&#13;
2002 gathered information about beneficiaries' occupational situations when the program was&#13;
launched. The data showed that beneficiaries, on average, had been unemployed for seven&#13;
months before entering the program. Consequently, the total length of time that beneficiaries&#13;
were unemployed is corrected by a factor that captures the period of unemployment that pre-&#13;
ceded their plan enrollment:18&#13;
&#13;
    · duration of unemployment, completed periods = 7 + time of enrollment declared in period&#13;
        1 + time between surveys (six months) ­ duration of current job declared in period 2, and&#13;
    · duration of unemployment, ongoing periods = 7 + time of enrollment declared in period 2.&#13;
&#13;
The regressors are reduced because of the lack of information about the last occupation. Com-&#13;
pensation-related variables, demographics, education level, and region of residence are main-&#13;
tained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    CLASSIFICATION 2 RESULTS. Table 3.13 summarizes the results of the estimations when the re-&#13;
strictive definition of employment is used. The set of regressors is shorter than in the classifica-&#13;
tion 1 scenario because variables associated with the characteristics of last occupation have been&#13;
dropped from the model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    18. The method suggested could be considered arbitrary and surely contains a degree of inaccuracy. It&#13;
is used because the results obtained are consistent with the evidence in the literature. The studies found&#13;
that "most of beneficiaries [when enrolled] were affected by long-term unemployment, while 59% of men&#13;
and 81% of women had been looking actively for a job for more than six months" (Roca et al. 2003, p. 25).&#13;
In any case, the method that I used was broad because it was based on averages, and it should be inter-&#13;
preted as an approach.&#13;

    As expected, results in the second scenario differ from those in the first scenario. The gener-&#13;
al loss of significance of the explanatory variables is remarkable. The variables that significantly&#13;
predict the risk of unemployment are sex, status as head of household, and assistance recipien-&#13;
cy. In addition, age and the dummy for the Patagonia region predict the hazard.&#13;
    Benefit-related variables indicate that the risk of unemployment significantly increases for&#13;
Plan Jefes participants. Compared with nonassisted workers, the probability of transitioning to&#13;
employment is 31 percentage points lower, and the hazard rate is more than two times lower&#13;
among the assisted.&#13;
    Although insurance and applicant status are not significant enough to explain the results,&#13;
they are negatively associated with transitions to employment. Insurance reduces the probabil-&#13;
ity of employment and the hazard indicating the existence of disincentive effects associated&#13;
with the benefit. The condition of applicant also negatively affects the move to employment in&#13;
both the logit and Cox models. As before, this result reflects the fact that part of the applicants&#13;
became beneficiaries (hence, unemployed) in this model.&#13;
    The variable age does not predict the probability of transitioning to employment, but it sig-&#13;
nificantly reduces the hazard to employment and produces longer periods of unemployment.&#13;
For every increase in the level of the regressor equal to one standard error, the hazard decreases&#13;
28 percent.&#13;
    The variable sex acquires the significance to explain the results, and it shows that the risk of&#13;
unemployment is lower for male workers than for females. These results are consistent with&#13;
theoretical considerations and represent a major difference from the classification 1 scenario.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                             Ana Lucía Iturriza  69&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Status as head of household is significant and has the same impact as it did in the previous&#13;
model and as expected on the basis of the evidence. In this case, the results cannot be related to&#13;
assistance recipiency. This is a genuine result attributable to the behavior of household heads.&#13;
         The regional analysis shows that workers from Patagonia display a higher hazard than do un-&#13;
employed workers from Greater Buenos Aires. AS noted in the classification 1 analysis, this region&#13;
is the only one in which the number of Plan Jefes beneficiaries is lower than the national average.&#13;
         Finally, once again the level of education is not significant.&#13;
         In sum, for the classification 2 scenario, the creation of work during the period favored male&#13;
workers and household heads, and relatively young workers and residents of Patagonia had&#13;
shorter periods of unemployment. The risk of unemployment increased significantly, however,&#13;
for individuals enrolled in the assistance program. The disincentive effects of UA are exposed in&#13;
these regressions. When the definition of employment is restricted to nonassisted modalities,&#13;
the disincentive effects on the search effort explain the worsening of the possibility of obtaining&#13;
employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Duration of Unemployment Periods under Alternative Classifications&#13;
&#13;
To this point, unemployment duration has been reported in terms of percentage changes in haz-&#13;
ard rates to employment. That is the standard manner for reporting the results, and it allows the&#13;
measurement of elasticities associated with determinate regressors.&#13;
         Deriving the length of unemployment periods from Cox models is complex because the&#13;
process involves estimating the baseline hazard. Nonparametric analysis, operationalized with&#13;
the KM estimator, represents an alternative way to deal with the duration of unemployment pe-&#13;
riods. Although KM is a descriptive instrument in which individual characteristics are not ac-&#13;
counted for, the comparison is still possible.&#13;
         There are several methods for comparing survival curves. For the objectives of the present&#13;
analysis, the elements provided by the survival functions and the life table (Walters 2000) will&#13;
suffice. Figure 3.1 displays the survival function for the unemployed workers, grouped by clas-&#13;
sification. Table 3.14 presents percentile measures of the moves from unemployment to jobs.&#13;
         The longer duration of unemployment in the second case is clear from the figure and the&#13;
data in the table. In classification 1, 25 percent of the periods of unemployment last up to six&#13;
months, 50 percent last up to 13 months, and 75 percent last up to 29 months. The mean of the&#13;
distribution is 8.7 months. In classification 2, the periods of unemployment increase in length,&#13;
which is evident in a more slowly decreasing survival curve that, in turn, follows from the rela-&#13;
tively longer duration of unemployment in the second group. The percentile distribution is read&#13;
in the same way as before, and the mean of the distribution is 10.4 months.&#13;

&#13;
   Nonparametric analysis indicates that, when employment is broadly computed, the average&#13;
period of unemployment lasts 8.7 months; when it is restrictively defined, the average is 10.4&#13;
months. The average difference of 1.7 months is attributable to the differences in the definition&#13;
of employment.&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
Using panel data from Argentine households collected in October 2002 and May 2003, this re-&#13;
port has evaluated the influence of UI and UA (Plan Jefes) on the risk of unemployment for the&#13;
purpose of identifying the presence of disincentive effects associated with such benefits.&#13;
   The hypothesis that unemployment compensation increases the risk of unemployment has&#13;
been studied extensively in the literature. However, a systematic study of the effects of the com-&#13;
pensation on the incidence and duration of unemployment in Argentina has not been undertaken.&#13;
   Following the literature on compensation analysis, binary logit models were used to esti-&#13;
mate the probability of transition from unemployment to employment, and Cox proportional&#13;
hazards models were used to estimate the duration of unemployment. The KM estimator also&#13;
was computed for a nonparametric analysis of the events.&#13;
   To address the specifics of the Argentine case, the analysis was performed for two different&#13;
scenarios, termed classifications 1 and 2. The first classification was based on a broad definition&#13;
of employment that treated those people receiving UA as employed, whereas the second classi-&#13;
fication was based on a restrictive definition of employment that did not treat assistance recipi-&#13;
ents as employed. Given the magnitude of Plan Jefes, the size of the flows across labor market&#13;
status changes considerably from one scenario to the other.&#13;
   This study found that, for the first classification, UA appears to be an efficient instrument&#13;
that favors reinserting unemployed workers into jobs and does not introduce disincentive ef-&#13;
fects. Results of the logit and Cox models consistently showed that both assistance participants&#13;
and applicants exhibit higher probabilities of transitioning to employment and shorter periods&#13;
of unemployment that follow from their higher hazards to employment. However, these results&#13;
also capture the behavior of a small part of the participants.&#13;
   In the second classification, there is evidence of demotivating effects associated with the use&#13;
of the assistance program. According to logit and Cox models, unemployed workers who re-&#13;
ceive assistance have a lower probability of moving into employment and lower hazards to em-&#13;
ployment that translate into longer periods of unemployment.&#13;
   The use of UI was not found to affect the employment behavior of participating workers.&#13;
That result is similar in both classifications under analysis and follows from the low significance&#13;
that the variable exhibited in logit and Cox models. This finding suggests that there are no dis-&#13;
incentive effects associated with the use of UI. Nevertheless, as was pointed out in the text, UI&#13;
has limited coverage and only formal workers have access to it.&#13;
   From the discussion about the distinction between the two classifications of employment,&#13;
the relevance of applying a definition of employment toward which the policy efforts can be ad-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                        Ana Lucía Iturriza   71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
dressed is evident. Ideally, the definition should be in agreement with society's expectations&#13;
about employment.&#13;
   Finally, policy instruments should be reviewed in accordance with the objectives for which&#13;
they are created, particularly distinguishing between employment creation and other forms of&#13;
social protection. The aim of labor policy should be the design of instruments to replace the as-&#13;
sisted forms of employment with regular jobs.&#13;

Distributional Implications of Power Sector Reforms&#13;
in the Philippines&#13;

This report assesses the distributional implications of Philippine power sector reforms for residential con-&#13;
sumers of electricity. We first estimate the demand for electricity, taking into consideration the difficulties&#13;
produced by the block pricing of electricity. We then simulate the impact of power reforms in terms of in-&#13;
creased electricity prices, assuming a linear budget set and using the elasticities from the demand equa-&#13;
tion. That exercise draws heavily on the duality in consumer theory that enables us to recover the utility&#13;
function of individuals and to assess welfare in terms of compensating variation. This report states that&#13;
an increase in the price of electricity will result in higher welfare losses as household income increases.&#13;
Among the poorest households, however, the welfare loss is greatest among the lower-income groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Power sector restructuring has been the centerpiece of Philippine reform policy in the years&#13;
2001 through 2007. Following successful privatization of the country's telecommunications and&#13;
water industries and the power sector's vast experience with various privatization programs&#13;
(such as the build-operate-transfer scheme), the major restructuring in the sector started in 2001&#13;
with the passing of the Electric Power Industry Act.&#13;
    That legislation began the gut-wrenching reforms in the sector as it dismantled the decades-&#13;
old monopoly--the National Power Corporation (Napocor)--and sought more private sector&#13;
participation in the industry. Napocor was spun off into two separate businesses: power gener-&#13;
ation and power transmission. The generation component was placed under the operational&#13;
control of Napocor until its complete sale and privatization, and the transmission business was&#13;
placed under the management of the newly created National Transmission Corporation&#13;

     The power sector reform has been implemented in the midst of such macroeconomic problems&#13;
as rising fiscal deficits and an overall ballooning debt burden (see figure 4.1). Given the economic&#13;
climate, the government is in a very tight position trying to provide continuing subsidies and sup-&#13;
port to Napocor, as shown in figure 4.2. The government must accomplish this provisioning in the&#13;
presence of Napocor's steadily declining net income and the corporation's increasing debt stock&#13;
(figure 4.3). And, as figure 4.4 illustrates, Napocor cannot rely on its internally generated revenues&#13;
to maintain and upgrade electricity infrastructure and to continue serving its customers. It cannot&#13;
raise its tariff to a level that makes it profitable; that is, increasing the nominal tariff will not raise&#13;
the firm's profitability, as measured by the return on rate base from 1998 onward.&#13;

State Grid Corporation of China.&#13;

     As the reform seeks to reduce the government support to Napocor and to increase the sec-&#13;
tor's efficiency as a whole by enabling (1) a more competitive structure for the industry and (2)&#13;
more private sector participation, the dynamics of gradually removing existing subsidies versus&#13;
having a more efficient and competitive industry make it difficult to assess the vector of price&#13;
change. The government maintains that the reforms will prompt price declines, but some sec-&#13;
tors believe that prices will go up. Both sides agree, however, that in the presence of reforms, the&#13;
price of electricity will reflect its true cost so that the competitive structure will work and the&#13;
private sector will be enticed to invest in the industry.&#13;
     Given the changes, the impact of reform could be wide and far-ranging. However, its poten-&#13;
tial impact on consumers is one of the most interesting aspects of the reform because of the gov-&#13;
ernment's long involvement in the sector and the history of cross-subsidies among consumer&#13;
groups--that is, residential, industrial, and commercial consumers.&#13;
     Because the retail price of electricity has been changing as a result of reforms, there is a grow-&#13;
ing need to understand its distributional consequences, and those consequences have been the&#13;
subject of considerable debate. One would expect welfare effects to vary across families, accord-&#13;
ing to how much electricity families consume. Each household's consumption is related to its in-&#13;

&#13;
come and demographic makeup. Thus, to appreciate how consumers react to price changes, we&#13;
need first to understand the demand for electricity and its relation to price.&#13;
    This report has two distinct parts. The first part, which estimates the demand for electricity,&#13;
tries to address the endogeneity and simultaneity problems inherent in residential electricity de-&#13;
mand. It also covers our nonrandom sample selection. Our treatment casts these interrelated is-&#13;
sues along the lines of Hall (1973) and Heckman (1979). Then we estimate the model using the&#13;
data from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) that includes household character-&#13;
istics, total expenditures, and spending on electricity. The second part of the report focuses on&#13;
application. We simulate the impact of an increase in price and assess its distributional implica-&#13;
tions, using the well-known dual approach to consumer behavior and its use in measuring the&#13;
costs and benefits of price and other changes. For that exercise, we assume a linear budget con-&#13;
straint, using the observed market demand curve estimated in the first part of the chapter, and&#13;
then derive the corresponding indirect utility function, the expenditure function, and finally our&#13;
measure of welfare--the compensating variation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Estimation of Residential Electricity Demand&#13;
&#13;
Difficulties in Modeling Residential Demand&#13;
&#13;
Among the difficulties that researchers should tackle are endogeneity and simultaneity prob-&#13;
lems caused by appliance replacement and, to some extent, dwelling decisions.2 Cowing and&#13;
McFadden (1984) noted that electricity is not consumed as it is; rather, it is consumed as an in-&#13;
put to household processes of climate control, lighting, and provision of other needs. House-&#13;
hold technology for electricity consumption, on the other hand, is largely determined by the&#13;
characteristics of the dwelling and durable equipment. Therefore, the level of electricity con-&#13;
sumption is determined by behavioral decisions on use, choice of dwelling, and characteristics&#13;
of appliances, among other things. Replacement and retrofit decisions, however, depend as well&#13;
on electricity price expectations.&#13;
    Second, there is the endogeneity and simultaneity problem that results from the presence of&#13;
multipart tariffs. In a multipart tariff, the marginal price charged to a consumer changes in a&#13;
stepwise fashion with the quantity demanded; depending on the context, these tariffs may ex-&#13;
hibit increasing or decreasing marginal prices. The challenge in an empirical study is how to in-&#13;
corporate a complex price schedule into a demand specification in a way that is consistent with&#13;
the economic theory. Taylor (1975) provided a succinct description of the issues in modeling de-&#13;
mand for electricity that are caused by multiblock pricing.&#13;
    In the Philippines, all residential consumers, except those in the National Capital Region,&#13;
pay a fixed amount for the minimum number of kilowatt hours (kWhs) of electricity consumed.&#13;
These households then pay a marginal price for additional units consumed. This type of pricing&#13;
system implies that consumers face a nonlinear (that is, kinked) budget constraint similar to that&#13;
depicted in figure 4.5. The budget line is drawn under the assumption that there are just two&#13;
goods: electricity, denoted by X, and the numéraire good, denoted by Y.&#13;
    Here is the budget line for a kinked budget constraint:&#13;
&#13;
                                                     at X = 0, M = Y;                                     (4.1)&#13;
&#13;
                                                   at 0 &lt; X &lt; x*; and&#13;
&#13;
                                          at X &gt; x*, M = F + p (X ­ x*) + Y.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2. Although the decision on a dwelling and its relationship with the price of electricity should be the&#13;
subject of a more detailed study, in the Philippines there is no indication that household dwelling decisions&#13;
are affected by electricity price. See the regression runs of dwelling characteristics on electricity price pre-&#13;
sented in table 4A.1 at the end of this chapter.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Segment 1 is the horizontal segment of the budget constraint equal to the fixed charge, F.&#13;
Segment 2 is the linear segment from the kink; x* has a slope equal to the price p. Kinked budg-&#13;
et constraints create difficulty in estimating demand functions for reasons that are related to&#13;
economic theory, which assumes that consumers purchase any desired quantity at a constant&#13;
price, subject to a budget constraint. The standard econometric approach to this problem has its&#13;
source in Hall (1973): linearize the budget constraint. Doing so requires computing the virtual&#13;
income, which can be seen in figure 4.5 to be the intercept of segment 2 if it is extended to the ver-&#13;
tical axis. It is as though households in segment 2 were facing a linear budget constraint with&#13;
slope equal to the observed price p and intercept m the virtual income.&#13;
   Here is the formula for computing the virtual income m:&#13;
&#13;
                                              M = F + p(X ­ x*) + F                                      (4.2)&#13;
                                                 = F + pX ­ px* + Y&#13;
                                  M + px* ­ F = Y + pX&#13;
                                               m = Y + pX.&#13;
&#13;
By computing the virtual income, we can express demand under nonlinear pricing in terms of&#13;
the ordinary demand function, which assumes a linear budget constraint. However, even if we&#13;
are able to compute the virtual income, our demand estimation has to consider the problem&#13;
caused by consumers sorting themselves between the segments--that is, households choosing&#13;
either (1) to consume less than x* and pay only the fixed charge F; or (2) to consume above x*&#13;
and pay both F and the marginal price p for consumption greater than x*. This sorting makes&#13;
calculating demand difficult because we must account for the consumer's willingness to switch&#13;
tariff segments. This also makes virtual income endogenous because it now becomes a function&#13;
of price observed only in segment 2.&#13;
   It is also difficult to assess the demand for electricity among households in segment 1 or&#13;
those paying only a fixed amount for electricity. We are constrained to use these observations in&#13;
our regression, which leads to another problem--nonrandom sample selection.&#13;
   To address these difficulties in estimating the demand for electricity, we have implemented a&#13;
three-step estimation procedure (discussed in detail below) based on previous approaches to&#13;
modeling demand for electricity and estimating demand for nonlinear budget sets.&#13;

Approaches to Modeling Demand&#13;
&#13;
A number of studies on electricity demand have tried to present a detailed description of resi-&#13;
dential energy consumption, albeit using different approaches. Houthakker's (1951) study of&#13;
residential electricity consumption in the United Kingdom is considered one of the pioneering&#13;
studies on energy demand. It is pioneering in many respects. It is one of the earliest studies on&#13;
demand to take into account the econometric implications of a two-part tariff by using margin-&#13;
al rather than average price, and to consider the cross-price or substitution effect of natural gas&#13;
on electricity demand.&#13;
    The work of Fisher and Kaysen (1962), on the other hand, is considered the most ambitious of&#13;
early dynamic studies of residential energy demand. Those investigators distinguished between&#13;
short-run and long-run electricity demand. In the short run, they estimated electricity consump-&#13;
tion as a function of stock and average utilization of electricity, using household appliances. In&#13;
contrast, they estimated long-run consumption for five different classes of electric appliances--&#13;
washing machines, refrigerators, irons, ranges, and water heaters. Their results indicated that in-&#13;
come and population were among the important determinants of long-run residential demand.&#13;
    In a literature survey of electricity demand studies, however, Taylor (1975) lamented the fact&#13;
that the research on residential electricity demand fails to deal adequately with block pricing.&#13;
He suggested that regressors should include both the marginal price and the average price--the&#13;
latter to account for the income effect arising from the differential between marginal and intra-&#13;
marginal prices. Since the time of Taylor's literature review, various demand studies have tried&#13;
to address the issue of nonlinear pricing. Some of those studies have had strong influence from&#13;
the literature on labor supply that also tried to address closely related issues. Labor supply has&#13;
been difficult to estimate because of the presence of a nonlinear tax schedule and the fact that in-&#13;
dividuals have different tastes for reasons that cannot be controlled using observable informa-&#13;
tion. Thus, demand studies increasingly have employed virtual income, instrumental variable,&#13;
and two-stage least squares approaches as well as sample selection models--all of which previ-&#13;
ously appeared in labor supply studies.&#13;
    Hausman, Kinnucan, and McFadden (1979) analyzed the results of the pricing test that attempts&#13;
to estimate the effect of household electricity demand on time-of-day pricing. They took the appli-&#13;
ance stock as fixed so that the medium- and long-run responses cannot be inferred from the analy-&#13;
sis. Their approach used traditional econometric consumer demand estimation and treated elec-&#13;
tricity demand within a two-stage budgetary context. They let electricity demand in each period be&#13;
a different commodity, and then estimated the relative household demand across periods, condi-&#13;
tional on relative prices, the appliance stock, socioeconomic characteristics of households, and the&#13;
weather. They then applied two-stage least squares to specify how the price of electricity was en-&#13;
tered into the demand equations. They linearized the budget set, that is, virtual income at a reduced&#13;
form prediction on monthly consumption. They used predicted quantities and the rate schedule to&#13;
form the predicted price variable, which served as an instrumental variable for the observed mar-&#13;
ginal price in the second-stage ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of the demand equation.&#13;
Their analysis exhibited biases opposite in sign to those of their OLS counterparts.&#13;
    Reiss and White (2004) studied electricity demand from a sample of California households,&#13;
trying to develop an estimable model that could be used to evaluate alternative tariff designs.&#13;
They assumed that the demand for electricity is derived from the flow of services provided by a&#13;
household's durable energy-using appliances, and they made a distinction between short-run&#13;
and long-run demand elasticities. The short-run elasticities referred to demand behavior, taking&#13;
a household's existing appliance stock as given; the long-run elasticities were meant to incorpo-&#13;
rate both changes in utilization behavior and any adjustments to the stock of appliances owned&#13;
by the household. Their approach to modeling electricity demand conditioned econometric&#13;
analysis on a household's existing appliances, which enabled them to model heterogeneity by&#13;
specifying electricity demand function at the level of individual appliances.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                            Wondielyn Q. Manalo-Macua    79&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Other residential electricity demand stud.0. 0ies also used a sample selection model based&#13;
on Heckman (1979) to address the block rate structure. The basic idea of the sample selection&#13;
model is that the outcome of variable x is observed only if some criterion defined with respect to&#13;
variable z is met. The common form of the model has two stages. In the first stage, the dichoto-&#13;
mous variable z determines whether x is observed; x is observed only if z=1. In the second stage,&#13;
the expected value of x conditional on it being observed is estimated.3 For the present study,&#13;
however, we are interested primarily in modeling incidental truncation, where the usual ap-&#13;
proach is to add an explicit selection equation to the population model of interest:&#13;
&#13;
                                           y = xb + u, E(u | x) = 0,                                  (4.3)&#13;
&#13;
                                              s = 1[zg + v  0],                                       (4.4)&#13;
&#13;
where si = 1 if we observe y, and = 0 otherwise. We assume that elements of x and z are always&#13;
observed, and we write xb = b0 + b1x1 +. . . . + bkxk and zg = g0 + g1z1 +. . . . + gmzm. The equation&#13;
can be estimated by OLS, given a random sample. The selection equation (4.4) depends on ob-&#13;
served variables, zh and an unobserved error, v. For the following proposed model to work well,&#13;
x should be a strict subset of z. Using all n observations, estimate the probit model of si on zi and&#13;
obtain the estimate for the inverse mills ratio,l^h. Then, using the selected sample--that is, ob-&#13;
servations for which si = 1 (say, n1 of them)--run the regression of yi on xi,l^i.4&#13;
    Terza and Welch (1982) and Terza (1986) used a two-stage method similar to one developed&#13;
by Heckman in analyzing increasing block tariffs. Their analyses required a specification of&#13;
which block a household consumes in, and in their studies the choice of block could be explained&#13;
with reference to consumer surplus. The two-stage probit approach applied in estimating elec-&#13;
tricity demand captures the declining block pricing. The approach consists of (1) estimating the&#13;
probit model of the observed rate block outcomes and (2) using the probit results to compute the&#13;
"correction factor" that the researchers included in the demand equation, which can be estimat-&#13;
ed by OLS. According to Terza (1986), this correction factor serves to purge the demand equation&#13;
of the negative correlation between the price variable and the random error term.&#13;
    Maddock, Castano, and Vella (1992) suggested a similar approach. They presented an esti-&#13;
mator for generalized selectivity bias based on Heckman's sample selection estimator. (They&#13;
called their approach the "generalized Heckman approach.") In that same report, they applied&#13;
Burtless and Hausman's (1978) technique5 in dealing with nonlinear prices, and they concluded&#13;
that Hausman's method produces perfectly credible results--that is, the signs are right, the pat-&#13;
tern of results is consistent, there is no evidence of heteroskedasticity, and the parameters are&#13;
about the right magnitudes. They compared the results with alternative methods of estimating&#13;
electricity demand; and, to resolve the difference between the results of the methods, they sug-&#13;
gested the use of the said Heckman approach to treat the sample selection model. They used&#13;
that model in estimating demand for electricity in Colombia, with a pricing system that includ-&#13;
ed a connection fee and an increasing block rate structure in five steps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    3. See the summary of Heckman's sample selection model in Sweeney (2005).&#13;
    4. This discussion of incidental truncation was taken from Wooldridge (2003).&#13;
    5. Burtless and Hausman (1978) offered a sophisticated technique to analyze labor supply responses&#13;
under nonlinear income taxation. They examined the negative income tax program that created a noncon-&#13;
vex budget set, and incorporated the federal income tax that created convex budget sets. Their model al-&#13;
lowed distribution of preferences for work in the population or individual variations in tastes (hetero-&#13;
geneity); that is, two individuals who face the same budget sets may prefer to work substantially different&#13;
amounts. They estimated a two-error model: measurement error and heterogeneity error. The former was&#13;
assumed to be additive, but the latter was assumed to be located in the income coefficient and constrained&#13;
to be of theoretically correct sign. Their method requires using complex statistical technique in computing&#13;
the maximum likelihood estimates.&#13;

Measurement of Welfare&#13;
&#13;
We will discuss the derivation of our measure of welfare before going into the details of our own&#13;
estimation of demand.6 Hausman (1981) derived an exact measure of consumer surplus coming&#13;
from the observed market demand. Deriving consumer surplus in this way is very appealing&#13;
because we can use the parameters from the estimated demand to give us a measure of wel-&#13;
fare--compensating variation.--that is defined as the amount of money the household would&#13;
need to be given at the new set of prices to attain the prereform level of utility. Hausman's deri-&#13;
vation draws heavily from the duality in consumer theory that links the primal and dual prob-&#13;
lems in consumer optimization. The primal problem of consumer choice is when a consumer&#13;
chooses a consumption pattern so as to maximize her utility u, subject to given price p and ex-&#13;
ogenous income y; that is,&#13;
&#13;
                                     Maximize u = u(x), subject to p · x = y.                   (4.5)&#13;
&#13;
   The dual problem of consumer choice, on the other hand, is the mirror of the primal prob-&#13;
lem: a consumer chooses a consumption pattern so as to minimize her expenditure y (total ex-&#13;
penditure or income) on consumption, given price p and exogenous utility level u; that is,&#13;
&#13;
                                     Minimize y = p · x, subject to u = u(x).                   (4.6)&#13;
&#13;
   In both problems, optimal values of x are being sought. In the primal problem, the solution&#13;
is a set of the Marshallian demand function, x(p,y). In the dual problem, the determining vari-&#13;
ables are u and p, so we have the cost-minimizing demand function h(p,u)--also called the&#13;
"Hicksian demand function." Each of these solutions can be substituted back into its respective&#13;
problems to give (1) the maximum attainable utility v(p,y) from the primal problem and (2) the&#13;
minimum attainable cost e(p,u) of the dual problem. Therefore,&#13;
&#13;
                                           v(p,y) = max [u(x); p · x = y]                       (4.7)&#13;
&#13;
                                           e(p,u) = min [p · x; u (x) = u].                     (4.8)&#13;
&#13;
   The function v(p,y) also is called the "indirect utility function," and the function e(p,u) can be&#13;
called the "cost or expenditure function." The important property of the expenditure function is&#13;
that its partial derivative with respect to price gives the Hicksian compensated demand curves:&#13;
&#13;
                                                   e(p, u­)&#13;
                                                      pj     = hj(p,u­).                        (4.9)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Another useful property is that of the indirect utility function using Roy's identity, which&#13;
yields the observed market demand curves as partial derivatives of v(p,y):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xj (p,y) = ­  v(p,y) / pj .&#13;
                                                             v(p,y) / y                        (4.10)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   We will use the expenditure function to derive the explicit utility function that will enable us&#13;
to measure the change in consumer surplus. Using the expenditure function makes computa-&#13;
tions easy because the arguments of the function depend only on the reform under consideration&#13;
and are completely independent of preferences. In the expenditure function, preferences are de-&#13;
scribed by the form of the function, and opportunities are described by the values of the func-&#13;
tion's arguments. In terms of the expenditure function, compensating variation is defined by&#13;
&#13;
                                                CV = e(p0,u0) ­ e(p1,u0)                       (4.11)&#13;
                                                     = e(p1,u0) ­ y0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   6. We are using Hausman's (1981) derivation of consumer's surplus.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                           Wondielyn Q. Manalo-Macua   81&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    To derive the exact compensating variation, we must take the observed market demand&#13;
curve and use the Roy's identity from equation (4.10) to integrate and derive the indirect utility&#13;
function. Inversion of the indirect utility gives the expenditure function, which enables us to cal-&#13;
culate the compensating variation in equation (4.11). We will use our demand estimates to sim-&#13;
ulate the impact of reforms, that is, in this case assuming an increase in the price of electricity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Estimation Procedure&#13;
&#13;
Residential Electricity Demand&#13;
&#13;
Our model analyzes the demand for electricity, taking the household appliance stock and&#13;
dwelling characteristics as fixed. Our economic variables are the household budget, the price of&#13;
electricity, virtual income, household characteristics, dwelling characteristics, regional dum-&#13;
mies, and year dummy. Our sample is limited to the households that have been determined by&#13;
survey to have access to electricity and pay for it. In this report, we will use the constant elastic-&#13;
ity demand specification in which z is the vector of household characteristics, x is the demand&#13;
for electricity, p is the price of electricity, and y is the total household expenditure or budget:&#13;
&#13;
                                                 x = ezg pa yb.                                    (4.12)&#13;
&#13;
Equation (4.12) often is estimated in log-linear form as&#13;
&#13;
                                      log x = g Z + alog(p) + blog(y).                             (4.13)&#13;
&#13;
    We specify the residential demand for electricity as&#13;
&#13;
                          ln kWh = a0 + a ln price + b ln budgetpc + b1 year 2003                  (4.14)&#13;
                                    + jg jeducj + jdjregionj + e.&#13;
&#13;
    The model consists of three steps. The first step involves estimating the probit model for&#13;
household spending below or above the previously described kink. Basically, we are using equa-&#13;
tion (4.4)--in this case, our selection equation s = 1 if the household spends above the kink, and&#13;
0 if it spends below the kink. The major implication of using this model is that we should have&#13;
at least one element in our probit equation that is not also in our demand function; in other&#13;
words, this variable should affect selection (being above the kink) but should not have partial&#13;
effect on demand for electricity. For the following reasons, in this report the excluded variable is&#13;
the fixed payment (see table 4.1 for details):&#13;
&#13;
    1. Fixed payment does not enter the demand equation because of the linearization of the&#13;
        budget constraint.&#13;
    2. Fixed payment may affect whether the consumer is beyond the kink.&#13;
    3 Fixed payment is a completely exogenous variable because it is determined by the gov-&#13;
        ernment.&#13;
    4. This is a time-variant variable; that is, for some regions, it changes over time.&#13;
&#13;
    We will compute the inverse Mills ratio from the probit equation that will be included as one&#13;
of the explanatory variables in the demand regression. This first-step regression is needed to&#13;
capture the impact of dropping 2,308 households that spent below the kink because there is no&#13;
way we can ever measure the demand for those observations.7&#13;
    The second step of the three-step method addresses the concern about virtual income's en-&#13;
dogeneity. We will use the real expenditure as an instrumental variable for virtual income. We&#13;

by the first-step regression.&#13;

&#13;
Compensating Variation&#13;
&#13;
In this section (based on Hausman [1981]), we will derive compensating variation using the&#13;
constant elasticity demand specification in equation (4.12). First, we need to find the indirect&#13;
utility function by using the technique of separating variables to find the following:&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    p1+a    y1­b&#13;
                                           v(p,y) = c = ­ eZg ·1+a +1­b ,                         (4.15)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
where c is the constant of integration, which we set equal to the initial utility level u. The fol-&#13;
                                                                                            ­&#13;
&#13;
lowing are two conditions that help us determine if we have a valid indirect utility that arises&#13;
from consumer maximization: (1) the indirect utility function is continuous and homogenous of&#13;
degree 0 in prices and income; and (2) the indirect utility function is a decreasing function in&#13;
prices, so that a  0, and it is increasing in income if b  0. A third condition the indirect utility&#13;
must satisfy is quasi-concavity that is equivalent to the Slutsky condition:&#13;
&#13;
                                           h(p,u)      x(p,y)            x(p,y)&#13;
                                              p      ­   p       = x ·      y                     (4.16)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    According to Hausman (1981), as long as the Slutsky sign conditions are satisfied by the de-&#13;
mand function, we can calculate the exact consumer surplus so that the compensating variation&#13;
for a change in price from p0 to p1 using equation (4.18). Equation (4.18) is the formula for com-&#13;
pensating variation that we used in our analysis.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Descriptive Measures&#13;
&#13;
Family Income and Expenditure Survey&#13;
&#13;
Our data consist of a pooled cross-section of the 2000 and 2003 Family Income and Expenditure&#13;
Surveys. The 2000 survey contained 39,000 observations; the 2003 survey had 41,000 observa-&#13;
tions. Our final sample consists of 61,197 observations, households that indicated they have ac-&#13;
cess to electricity and reported positive spending on electricity. The surveys contain information&#13;
about household total expenditure, income, total fuel spending per fuel group, household mem-&#13;
bers, and dwelling characteristics. We used these parameters in our regression. Although FIES&#13;
does not report the quantity of electricity consumed by the household, it can be calculated using&#13;
the household's electricity expenditure divided by the price of electricity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    REGIONAL RECLASSIFICATION. We have combined regions 13 and 3 to enable our three-step&#13;
model to work. This was done to force probit to retain the National Capital Region observations,&#13;
although that region does not have fixed payment in its pricing schedule. The choice of region 3&#13;
as the combining region was natural because of its proximity to the National Capital Region.&#13;
The number of observations based on the new regional classification is given in table 4.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    INCOME CATEGORIES. The income quartile to which a household belongs is computed for the&#13;
remaining sample, based on each household's real total expenditure. This computation is done&#13;
by calculating income quartile per year and then combining both years (2000 and 2003) so that&#13;
there is no need to readjust the expenditure/income to some base year. Table 4.2 shows the&#13;
number of observations per income quartile and the mean electricity expenditure (in Philippine&#13;
pesos) and consumption (in kWhs) per quartile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Price of Electricity&#13;
&#13;
From the Philippine National Electrification Administration, we obtained the prices of electrici-&#13;
ty in effect during the survey periods for all regions except the National Capital Region. For that&#13;
region, the price of electricity came from the prevailing price of electricity charged by the Mani-&#13;
la Electric Company, which is the main distribution utility in metropolitan Manila. The Nation-&#13;

al Electrification Administration also reports the minimum consumption level and the amount&#13;
charged for it by electric cooperatives as well as the marginal price paid by households for con-&#13;
sumption in excess of the minimum. The price of electricity varies by region (see table 4.3).&#13;
Households that enjoy low price are in regions 9, 10, 11, 12, and 16, whereas those in regions 2,&#13;
4, 5, 14, 15 (the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao), and the National Capital Region pay&#13;
the highest price for the utility.&#13;

The results of the three-step regression method for all observations are given in table 4.4. The co-&#13;
efficient of the price in the third step can be interpreted as the price elasticity of demand, and the&#13;

coefficient of the virtual income is the income elasticity. The elasticities show correct signs: the&#13;
price elasticity is ­0.86 and the income elasticity is 0.91.&#13;
    The coefficients for the household head characteristics are significant and have the correct&#13;
signs. An additional household member increases the consumption of electricity, and the age of&#13;
the household head has a positive effect on consumption. The year dummy is positive but not&#13;
significant, perhaps because there was little difference between the prices in 2000 and 2003 for&#13;
some regions in the Philippines.&#13;
    The educational attainment dummies also showed the expected signs and significant coeffi-&#13;
cients; that is, as one becomes more educated, his electricity consumption increases. Based on&#13;
the data, it appears that highly educated people have either more appliances or more energy-&#13;
consuming appliances.9&#13;
    Regional dummies, however, all had negative signs. That result was expected with the com-&#13;
bined National Capital Region and region 3 as the base region, possibly because most households&#13;
in that area are more affluent or own more energy-intensive appliances than do households in any&#13;
other region. The coefficient inverse Mills ratio (invmills) and the residual (uhat) are also significant&#13;
(table 4.5). For the residual, the significant t-statistic means that virtual income is endogenous.&#13;

    The model was used to estimate demand, including various dwelling characteristics such as&#13;
the structure of roofs and walls, but the change in coefficients was minimal.10 We also estimated&#13;
separate price and income elasticities per income category.11 As in the regression using all ob-&#13;
servations, OLS gives consistently lower price elasticities per income category, but the income&#13;
elasticities are similar to the results of the three-step method. Table 4.6 shows that the lowest in-&#13;
come group has a relatively inelastic demand, second only to that of the fourth income quar-&#13;
tile.12 The reason for such inelastic demand may be that, compared with those in other income&#13;
groups, households in the first quartile own very few appliances, so even if the price of electric-&#13;
ity increases, they lack the freedom to adjust their consumption.13 In addition, the first and&#13;
fourth quartiles have the highest income elasticities (0.501 and 0.767, respectively).&#13;

We simulated the impact of a single price change--a 10 percent across-the-board increase in the&#13;
price of electricity for all regions in the Philippines. This simulation exercise assumes that we&#13;
have a linear budget set. The compensating variation is computed using (1) the parameter esti-&#13;
mates from demand based on all observations--that is, parameters in table 4.4, which we will&#13;
call parameter (a); and (2) per-quartile demand parameters (shown in table 4.6 and detailed in&#13;
table 4A.4), which we will call parameter (b).&#13;
    Figure 4.6 shows the total compensating variation, increasing as income increases. This re-&#13;
sult is true using both parameters. However, there is a notable difference in mean compensating&#13;
variation for the second and third quartiles: the compensating variation using parameter (b) is&#13;
less than the compensating variation using parameter (a).&#13;
    It appears, however, that using compensating variation alone as a measure of welfare loss&#13;
gives an incomplete picture of the distributional implications of a price increase. We wonder&#13;
about the burden of welfare loss in terms of its proportion to the total household expenditure.&#13;
For that reason, we also computed the welfare effects in terms of percentage loss14 by dividing&#13;
compensating variation by the total real expenditure per capita. Figure 4.7 shows that if we use&#13;
parameter (a), our conclusion is unchanged--that is, welfare as measured by percentage loss is&#13;
strictly increasing as income increases.&#13;
    However, if we use parameter (b), the distributional implications change dramatically. Fig-&#13;
ure 4.8 shows that the percentage loss is increasing as income increases; the loss of the poorest&#13;

group is greatest among the lower-income groups. This is true for both the OLS and three-step&#13;
methods. This outcome may imply that the poorest group loses because it has very low income&#13;
to start with (that is, any increase in price that translates into higher expenditure is translated&#13;

into a higher-percentage loss). This finding also may imply that the electricity price subsidies&#13;
provided to this income group will mask the impact of a price increase but will not change the&#13;
real cause of higher welfare loss, namely, low real income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
The residential demand curve is estimated, taking into consideration the difficulty posed by&#13;
such estimation: the nonlinearity in the budget set caused by fixed payments. In this report, we&#13;
have tried to treat these issues by using a three-step method that addresses the problems of non-&#13;
random selection and the endogeneity of the household budget used in demand estimation. The&#13;
residential demand is computed for all observations and compared with the results of OLS. The&#13;
results of the two approaches are not much different in terms of magnitude and signs of the co-&#13;
efficient.&#13;
    Although we did not make any explicit calculation on the precise impact of reform on the&#13;
price of electricity, we based the simulation exercise on an increase in price because its impact&#13;
probably will be of greatest interest in policy discussions. We simulated the impact of a 10 per-&#13;
cent increase in price, assuming a linear budget set using the parameters of demand estimated&#13;
for all observations and the per-quartile parameters.&#13;
    We found that the distributional implication of the price change will depend on the choice of&#13;
welfare measure and the parameters of demand used. In general, we found that, using compen-&#13;
sating variation alone, the loss increases as the income of the group increases. However, distrib-&#13;
utional implications change when we use the parameters of per-quartile demand and compute&#13;
percentage loss instead: the loss is highest among the lower-income groups. This finding sug-&#13;
gests an important policy implication concerning government-implemented lifeline subsidies&#13;
that give preferential electricity tariffs to marginal consumers of electricity. Although a lifeline&#13;
subsidy may be able to soften the impact of a price increase for the poorest group, it may not be&#13;
able to address the real cause of higher welfare loss--that is, poverty.&#13;

How to Improve Export Competitiveness in Mauritius&#13;
&#13;
Marilyn Whan-Kan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Export competitiveness is defined as a country's ability to produce and sell goods and services in foreign&#13;
markets at prices and quality levels that ensure long-run viability and sustainability. Mauritius is losing&#13;
its competitiveness, both over time and relative to its main market rivals. When analyzing the trend in&#13;
Mauritian competitiveness over time, using the unit labor cost index, one sees a declining trend, which is&#13;
explained by real wage increases not being matched by productivity growth. This decline over time also is&#13;
evident in the evolution of the terms of trade over a period of years. Low wages and low labor costs no&#13;
longer are sources of competitive advantage for Mauritius because several Asian market rivals have much&#13;
lower textile sector labor costs. Mauritian export prices tend to increase faster than those of its main com-&#13;
petitors. The growth rate in manufacturing exports also tends to lag behind that of Southeast Asia. The&#13;
problem is compounded by new challenges at the international level, related to Mauritius's loss of prefer-&#13;
ential markets. To improve export competitiveness, it is necessary to focus on one or a combination of the&#13;
following measures: an increase in labor productivity, wage rate decreases, or currency depreciation. It&#13;
appears that the most effective and sustainable way to improve competitiveness is to raise labor produc-&#13;
tivity because doing so acts directly on production costs. Unlike wage reduction and depreciation, pro-&#13;
ductivity boosts raise the standard of living. Several measures can be used to increase labor productivity:&#13;
maintaining a low rate of inflation and low interest rates, following international trends in setting inter-&#13;
est rate levels, and allowing some degree of exchange rate flexibility within a stable range; training work-&#13;
ers in new skills needed for technological change, focusing some training on management development&#13;
and improved supervisory quality, promoting a higher-performance culture through organizational de-&#13;
velopment, and stressing decision-making, communication, and teamwork skills; reducing transaction&#13;
costs by cutting bureaucratic red tape and delays in project approvals, and improving both physical infra-&#13;
structure and utility provision; and diversifying and differentiating export products, improving product&#13;
quality, and upgrading technology by retooling and modernizing production processes.&#13;

100    How to Improve Export Competitiveness in Mauritius&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mauritius has been transformed gradually from a monocrop economy to a more diversified one&#13;
over the period 1970 to the present. The economic structure for 1998­2002 (depicted in tables&#13;
5A.1 and 5A.2) rests on agriculture (mainly sugar), export-oriented manufacturing (mainly tex-&#13;
tiles), upmarket tourism, and financial and business services. The contributions to the island na-&#13;
tion's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002 were 6 percent for agriculture, 23 percent for man-&#13;
ufacturing, 6 percent for tourism, and 10 percent for banking and financial services. The&#13;
proportion of the workforce in the manufacturing sector rose from 26 percent in 1960 to 43 per-&#13;
cent in 1990, while that in the agricultural sector fell from 40 percent to 17 percent over the same&#13;
period. The manufacturing sector share in the economy has increased constantly since the rapid&#13;
development of the export processing zone (EPZ) sector. EPZ production, dominated by textiles&#13;
and garments, provided 70 percent of the total export revenue in 2002. Other main export com-&#13;
modities were sugar, molasses, and tea. The major export markets for the country's products are&#13;
France, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&#13;
    The economic progress made by Mauritius since the mid-1980s is seen as a success story.&#13;
Economic growth has averaged nearly 6 percent, and per capita GDP reached US$4,500 in 2003.&#13;
Trade liberalization and access to global markets have played an important role in the Mauritian&#13;
success, and the country has been able to attract foreign direct investment and take advantage of&#13;
its outward-oriented strategy through its sound social and political climates. The country has&#13;
benefited from the preferential access of its main export products to the European Union (EU)&#13;
under the Lomé Convention and from its vigorous export promotion policies. Exports since the&#13;
1980s have been supported by the country's relatively high literacy rates and the availability of&#13;
an underutilized female labor force, especially for garment exports. Import barriers have been&#13;
liberalized gradually, thereby easing the adjustment of domestically oriented enterprises to im-&#13;
port competition.&#13;
    Mauritius, however, is losing its competitiveness. It is becoming increasingly difficult to&#13;
compete with emerging low-wage garment-producing countries, as evidenced in recent years&#13;
by the delocalization of low-skilled production to Madagascar. There are now strains in the la-&#13;
bor market linked with patterns of international trade. The unemployment rate, which has in-&#13;
creased since the 1990s, is related to poor employment growth in the country's manufacturing&#13;
sector.&#13;
    Today, the issue of ways to address these challenges is most pressing. The purpose of this re-&#13;
port is to identify policies to enhance the competitiveness of Mauritian exports. The first part of&#13;
the report deals with concepts, measures, and trends in competitiveness for Mauritius, and&#13;
presents the main related challenges facing the country. The second part then discusses the rele-&#13;
vant policy measures recommended to increase the nation's export competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Concept of Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
The concept of competitiveness is widely discussed in the literature, but it remains somewhat&#13;
ambiguous. Some authors equate it with productivity, others with market share or export per-&#13;
formance, and still others (especially Porter [1990]) see in it a whole range of company or indus-&#13;
try attributes that provide a competitive advantage.&#13;
    Competitiveness can be examined at three levels. At the enterprise level, it reflects the ability&#13;
of a firm to sell and supply goods and/or services in a given market. The competitiveness of lo-&#13;
cal firms is defined by a cost advantage over foreign competitors. At the sectoral/industry level,&#13;
competitiveness refers to the extent to which a sector or industry offers the potential for growth&#13;
and an attractive return on investment. Finally, at the national level, it refers to the extent to&#13;
which a national environment is conducive or detrimental to business, thus enhancing or re-&#13;
ducing the capacity of the economy to improve the standard of living.&#13;
    Competitiveness refers to the ability of the enterprise/sector/country to produce and sell&#13;
goods and services in domestic and foreign markets at prices and quality that ensure long-run&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                 Marilyn Whan-Kan   101&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
viability and sustainability. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's&#13;
(OECD's) definition of competitiveness is&#13;
&#13;
        the degree to which, under open market conditions, a country can produce goods&#13;
        and services that meet the test of foreign competition while simultaneously main-&#13;
        taining and expanding domestic real income. (OECD 1992)&#13;
&#13;
    Because it has been argued that firms rather than countries compete with each other (Krug-&#13;
man 1994), the concept of competitiveness at the country/national level has been defined to re-&#13;
flect the "quality of the environment for investment and for increasing productivity in a climate&#13;
of macroeconomic stability and integration into the international economy" (Downs 2003, p. 12).&#13;
The broader approach to measuring the degree of competitiveness is therefore multifactoral.&#13;
    The OECD's definition of competitiveness proves to be a good guide toward making policy&#13;
choices. It does not encourage short-lived export booms that fail to raise the standard of living.&#13;
Instead, it leads policy decisions toward sustainably upgrading a country's competitive capabil-&#13;
ities, and it provides the opportunity for countries to become partners who specialize in differ-&#13;
ent economic activities emerging from their respective strengths.&#13;
    A distinction of major importance is the one between competitiveness and comparative ad-&#13;
vantage. Comparative advantage results from high productivity and factor abundance as reflected&#13;
by low factor prices, assuming that such other factors as product quality and sales services are&#13;
being captured by the price. Competitive advantage, on the other hand, results not only from these&#13;
real factors, but also from price distortions, such as subsidies and market price premia. For in-&#13;
stance, an undervalued exchange rate adds to competitiveness, whereas overvaluation reduces&#13;
it. It is clear that export industries may lose their ability to sell abroad either if wages are rising&#13;
in excess of productivity or if the exchange rate appreciates well beyond its equilibrium value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Measures and Trends in Export Competitiveness for Mauritius&#13;
&#13;
A country's export competitiveness can be measured in several ways. It is possible to examine it&#13;
through revealed or actual export performance or through factors that are expected to encour-&#13;
age good export performance (wages, exchange rate, incentives, and so forth). The latter can be&#13;
measured either through time-series analysis or through cross-country comparisons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Time-Series Analysis&#13;
&#13;
    UNIT LABOR COST. Changes in a country's competitiveness can be assessed by changes in the&#13;
real unit labor cost (ULC) of production over time--the ratio of real wages to labor productivity.&#13;
ULC is the remuneration of labor to produce one unit of output.&#13;
    ULC measures have the advantage of covering all industries: exporters, potential exporters,&#13;
and those competing with imports. For several reasons, however, it should not be interpreted as&#13;
a comprehensive measure of competitiveness. First, ULC measures deal only with the cost of la-&#13;
bor. Although labor costs account for the major share of inputs, the cost of capital and interme-&#13;
diate inputs also can be crucial factors in comparisons of cost competitiveness among countries.&#13;
Second, the measures reflect only cost competitiveness. In the case of durable consumer and in-&#13;
vestment goods, for example, competitiveness also is determined by technological and demand&#13;
factors. Third, measures of cost competitiveness may be distorted, for example, by the effects of&#13;
bilateral market access agreements, subsidies, and tariff protection.&#13;
    The trends in the index of ULC for Mauritian manufacturing and export sectors appear in&#13;
figure 5.1. The increasing trend in ULC can be explained by real wage increases not being&#13;
matched by productivity growth. Over the period, real wages rose while labor productivity de-&#13;
clined as a result of high rates of absenteeism and turnover, poor work discipline, and so forth.&#13;
This disparity tended to erode the competitiveness of Mauritian exports.&#13;

   TERMS OF TRADE. The terms of trade (or the ratio of the prices of tradable goods to the prices&#13;
of nontradable goods) also can be used as a measure of competitiveness. The terms-of-trade in-&#13;
dex measures the price movements of exports relative to imports:&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                   Export price index&#13;
                                                     Terms-of-trade index =                                                          (5.1)&#13;
                                                                                   Import price index&#13;
&#13;
A rise in the ratio means that a smaller volume of exports will pay for a larger volume of im-&#13;
ports, whereas a decline indicates an unfavorable movement because a larger volume of exports&#13;
must pay for the same volume of imports.&#13;
   The use of this measure of competitiveness tends to mask a number of factors underlying the&#13;
concept. Country-level competitiveness depends on a number of factors, including such macro-&#13;
economic variables as the volume of trade, resource allocation, and capital flows. Furthermore,&#13;
the most appropriate measure of competitiveness is income terms of trade, which is the ratio of&#13;
the value of exports to the price of imports. However, terms-of-trade calculations are complex,&#13;
and data on the income terms of trade may not be readily available for many countries.&#13;
   As is shown in figure 5.2, the terms-of-trade index for Mauritius experienced a declining&#13;
trend from 1998 to 2003. This decline suggests that competitiveness decreased over the period&#13;
on the following ground: as the prices of tradable goods decrease, relative to those of nontrad-&#13;
able goods, producers have an incentive to decrease the production of tradable goods and in-&#13;
crease the production of nontradable goods.&#13;

    REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE. The real effective exchange rate (REER) of a country is a&#13;
commonly used measure of its competitiveness. The effective exchange rate (EER) is a country's&#13;
nominal exchange rate, relative to that of a number of other countries that are considered com-&#13;
petitors. A trade-weighted average exchange rate for the country, relative to other countries, is&#13;
used. The REER is obtained by deflating the EER by appropriate price or cost (labor) deflators.&#13;
Each of these deflators has advantages and drawbacks that determine its overall usefulness as&#13;
an indicator of external competitiveness. A stronger REER indicates that the home country is&#13;
less competitive. The broad implication is that restoring competitiveness means that the curren-&#13;
cy must weaken or domestic prices/costs will have to increase less than foreign prices/costs.&#13;
    Figure 5.3 depicts the trends in the REER for Mauritius over the period beginning in 1970 or&#13;
1980 and ending in 2000. The trends imply a depreciation of the Mauritian currency. The ex-&#13;
change rates adjusted for inflation of consumer prices and unit labor costs reveal a milder real&#13;
depreciation than do the GDP deflator and the export price. The latter two price measures also&#13;
take traded goods into account and so are more likely to reflect the favorable prices introduced&#13;
by preferential trading arrangements.&#13;
    Normally, the developments of the REER shown in figure 5.3 would mean an increase in&#13;
competitiveness for the country because, with the depreciation, exports are promoted. The&#13;
REER, however, should be considered a misleading measure of competitiveness for Mauritius&#13;
for the following reasons. First, the competitiveness of Mauritian exports fell because the in-&#13;
creased costs of production outweighed the depreciation of the exchange rate. Second, the Mau-&#13;
ritian REER tends to reflect the effects of macroeconomic policies, especially exchange rate man-&#13;
agement, rather than the actual level of export competitiveness.&#13;
    To support this point, it is worth mentioning here that Mauritius devalued its currency by 30&#13;
percent in 1979 and by 20 percent in 1981, mainly to improve its external trade balance. It also&#13;

adopted a managed exchange rate policy in 1983 by which the central bank was authorized to&#13;
intervene on the foreign exchange market to smooth out irregular fluctuations in its currency.&#13;
Foreign exchange controls were liberalized partially in 1986 when commercial banks were al-&#13;
lowed to undertake transactions of up to MUR 200,000 without the approval of the central bank.&#13;
A further liberalization took place in 1994. The Exchange Control Act was suspended and free&#13;
movement of foreign exchange was permitted. Both the managed exchange rate policy and for-&#13;
eign exchange liberalization were meant to increase the competitiveness of export enterprises&#13;
on the world market.&#13;

    LABOR COSTS. The unit labor cost measure can be useful for analysis at the level of the aggre-&#13;
gate economy. However, the precise interpretation of a difference in ULC levels across countries&#13;
depends on the source from which the change originates. For instance, an increase in labor costs&#13;
can result from upward wage pressure or from a slowdown in productivity growth. Upward&#13;
wage pressure may be triggered by an appreciation of a country's currency or a shortage in the&#13;
labor market. A productivity slowdown may be caused by a rise in the sectoral share of the serv-&#13;
ices sector, by a lack of technological progress, or by slow reforms in product and labor markets.&#13;
    Table 5.1 shows comparative hourly labor compensation in the textile and apparel industries&#13;
for several countries in 2002. The data confirm that low wages and labor cost are no longer a&#13;
source of competitive advantage for Mauritius; there are several Asian countries with much&#13;
lower labor costs in textiles. Low-cost textiles and clothing produced in China and India are ex-&#13;
pected to dominate the market in countries that are parties to the World Trade Organization&#13;
(WTO) Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, thus lowering the world prices of these products.&#13;
In the context of Mauritius's weak external competitiveness, the lower world prices would&#13;
cause its share of global textiles and clothing to decrease further. This situation explains why&#13;
Mauritius has tried to delocalize manufacturing to low-wage neighboring countries, such as&#13;
Madagascar, to produce lower-quality products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    THE EXPORT PRICE INDEX. The competitiveness of a given country's export volumes is the dif-&#13;
ferential between the country's export price and that of its competitors in their common mar-&#13;
kets. The export price index (EPI) is a measure of price changes among domestically produced&#13;
Mauritian products exported to other countries. It measures pure price changes and takes ac-&#13;
count of all the main price-determining factors, such as country of destination, quality, mode of&#13;
transport, and mode of payment. The EPI covers all domestic exports. It can serve as a basis to&#13;

assess the competitiveness of Mauritian products in relation to price trends among common&#13;
products of other countries with which Mauritius competes for markets.&#13;
    The EPI, however, is deficient on several grounds. First, international competition itself will&#13;
tend to limit observed differences in export prices, especially in the longer term. Second, the cal-&#13;
culation of export prices is restricted to goods actually traded.&#13;
    Figure 5.4 compares the evolution of EPI in Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, the Republic of&#13;
Korea, and Mauritius between 1991 and 2002. It can be seen that, of the four economies, Mauri-&#13;
tius was the only one whose EPI increased in 2001, relative to the situation in 1991.&#13;

&#13;
    EXPORT GROWTH. Export competitiveness is examined after the fact through actual export&#13;
performance, which can be measured by the average growth rates of aggregate exports and&#13;
manufacturing exports. Export growth is a commonly used measure of international competi-&#13;
tiveness among developing countries because the data are readily available and easy to collect.&#13;
In table 5.2, these data are calculated for eight African countries, including Mauritius, and four&#13;
Asian countries for the period 1984­95. If we measure competitive advantage by the growth rate&#13;
of aggregate exports, Mauritius was less competitive than were Thailand and Tunisia. If we look&#13;
at the growth rate of manufacturing exports, we conclude that Mauritius lagged behind all the&#13;
Southeast Asian countries included in the sample, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    EFFECT OF COMPETITIVENESS ON EXPORT GROWTH. In a study of the export performance of some&#13;
sub-Saharan African countries, Gros, Letilly, and Martinet (2002) attempted to decompose the&#13;
growth of exports of a sample of African countries for the period 1991­99. The decomposition&#13;
was done such that the main factors affecting export growth in those countries were assumed to&#13;
be the level of world demand, the extent of trade specialization, and the degree of competitive&#13;
advantage. In other words, export growth was dependent on the world demand effect, the trade&#13;
specialization effect, and the competitive advantage effect. The effect of competitive advantage&#13;
determined the extent to which the country was able to increase its share of the world market in&#13;
its overall exports by doing better than its competitors. Hence, this effect considered both the&#13;
country's export diversification effort and its ability to maintain its comparative advantage in&#13;
traditional markets. The results of the study are presented in table 5.3.&#13;
    The Gros, Letilly, and Martinet (2002) study showed that, over the period, the comparative&#13;
advantage effect for Mauritius was negative, implying a loss of competitiveness for the coun-&#13;
try's exports. That finding was explained by the rise in the general level of remuneration in the&#13;

which technology is used. Employing nearly 300 variables, the Forum analyzes and ranks the&#13;
ability of countries to provide an environment in which enterprises can compete. Using indexes&#13;
of technological innovation, financial system efficiency, and the degree to which the country's&#13;
economy is integrated with the rest of the world (factors that contribute to a high rate of growth&#13;
in per capita GDP), the Forum's Growth Competitiveness Index (GCI) for 2002 ranked Mauri-&#13;
tius 41st in a group of 80 countries. Among 22 African countries included in the GCI, Mauritius&#13;
was ranked fourth, behind Botswana, Tunisia, and South Africa. The country's GCI ranking for&#13;
2003 was 46th of 102 countries, thus indicating a decline in overall competitiveness. The GCI&#13;
rankings for Mauritius for 2002 and 2003 are shown in table 5A.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
International Competitive Pressures&#13;
&#13;
Mauritius is losing its competitiveness, both over time and relative to its main rivals. This prob-&#13;
lem is compounded by new challenges at the regional and international levels. These challenges&#13;
are related to the threat of imminent loss of the economy's preferential markets. It should be&#13;
noted that preferential access to markets (namely, the nonreciprocal trade treatment of Maurit-&#13;
ian products in EU and U.S. markets) played a significant role in Mauritius's economic success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cotonou Agreement&#13;
&#13;
The Cotonou Agreement was enacted to replace the nonreciprocal preferential regime that had&#13;
been granted by the EU to all African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries with reciprocal,&#13;
WTO-compatible trade regimes between the EU and non­least-developed ACP countries. The&#13;
ACP countries would proceed either as regional groups, individually, or in any other alternative&#13;
trade arrangements that would be defined. In 2000, the EU requested a derogation from other&#13;
WTO members, thus enabling it to maintain existing trade preferences until 2008.&#13;
   The new Cotonou Agreement makes provision for nonreciprocal trade preferences for ACP&#13;
products until 2008. However, with the decision of the EU to grant free access to its market to all&#13;
products from least-developed countries, Mauritian products have been facing more competi-&#13;
tion. This competition will increase in 2008 when the Cotonou Agreement on nonreciprocal&#13;
trade preferences ends, leading to the entry into force of any economic partnership agreements&#13;
that will be concluded. Negotiations on the economic partnership agreement between the EU&#13;
and interested ACP states, subregions, or regions most likely will tend toward the emergence of&#13;
additional free trade areas.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108   How to Improve Export Competitiveness in Mauritius&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
World Trade Organization&#13;
&#13;
Globalization and trade liberalization have changed the way the world trades. The WTO has&#13;
made three major changes to the rules of world trade: First, it began the process of opening up&#13;
the most protected industries, agriculture and textiles. Second, it has extended the scope of in-&#13;
ternational trade rules to cover services as well as goods. Third, it has created a new system for&#13;
settling disputes by which decisions can be blocked only by a consensus of WTO members.&#13;
   Pressures at the WTO for substantive progressive liberalization of trade in agriculture have&#13;
increased significantly. This adversely affected Mauritius as an exporter of sugar under the Sug-&#13;
ar Protocol. The Multifiber Agreement phased out at the end of 2004. As a consequence, the&#13;
Mauritian textile industry started to face serious competition on the EU market from non­least-&#13;
developed countries. China's entry in the WTO alarmed the world, and Mauritius was very&#13;
much concerned because it would be extremely difficult to compete in textile products against&#13;
China, a low-wage economy. China's exports were fueled very rapidly with the country's entry&#13;
in the WTO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Policy Orientation&#13;
&#13;
Improving export competitiveness is an important consideration for policy makers when pro-&#13;
moting development. Competitive exports enable countries to earn more foreign exchange and&#13;
so to import the products, services, and technologies they need to raise their productivity and&#13;
living standards. Greater competitiveness also enables countries to diversify away from de-&#13;
pendence on a few primary commodity exports and to move up the skills and technology lad-&#13;
der--all of which is essential for increasing local value added and for sustaining rising wages.&#13;
Increased competitiveness enables a country to realize greater economies of scale and scope by&#13;
offering larger and more diverse markets. Competitiveness in industries, therefore, can provide&#13;
substantial leverage for economic growth, particularly for small nations like Mauritius, where&#13;
competitiveness can enable firms to overcome the limitations of their small home markets to&#13;
achieve their maximum potential.&#13;
   For all these reasons, it is necessary to increase the competitiveness of Mauritian exports. The&#13;
country's competitive advantage relative to its market rivals could rise in the presence of some&#13;
combination of the following conditions:&#13;
&#13;
   · Mauritian wages decrease relative to wages in competitor countries.&#13;
   · The Mauritian rupee depreciates relative to the currency in competitor countries.&#13;
   · Labor productivity in Mauritius increases relative to labor productivity in competitor&#13;
       economies.&#13;
&#13;
   On which condition(s) should Mauritius focus in an effort to raise its export competitive-&#13;
ness? Concerning the pressure for decreases in wage rates, we find that wages are downwardly&#13;
rigid: institutional factors make it difficult for wages to fall, despite this underlying pressure.&#13;
The current wage determination system in Mauritius is quite complex, fragmented, uncoordi-&#13;
nated, and rigid. There is no coordination among the key wage-determining organizations. The&#13;
minimum wage system in Mauritius is complex, consisting of approximately 460 different rates.&#13;
Market forces are visibly absent from the wage determination system, and the country does not&#13;
have a well-developed system of collective bargaining. A complete reform of the wage setting&#13;
mechanism is needed. However, because such reform tends to be a lengthy process, it may not&#13;
be an appropriate strategy for raising the country's level of competitiveness.&#13;
   As for currency depreciation, it certainly tends to improve international competitiveness by&#13;
reducing labor costs relative to labor productivity. Given labor market rigidities, exchange rate&#13;
changes can be a more feasible and effective way to alter relative unit labor costs than are nom-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                               Marilyn Whan-Kan 109&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
inal wage reductions. Since its first devaluation in 1979, however, the country has, been making&#13;
extensive use of currency depreciation. It devalued the Mauritian rupee twice (in 1979 and&#13;
1981), adopted a managed exchange rate policy, and fully liberalized its foreign exchange mar-&#13;
ket. Despite the central bank's mid-1980s efforts in exchange policy management and foreign&#13;
exchange liberalization, Mauritian exports experienced a declining competitiveness trend. This&#13;
decline does not imply that exchange rate policies were not effective for Mauritius, but their ef-&#13;
fectiveness was reduced by uncompetitive pressures in the labor market, namely, increases in&#13;
unit labor costs in the EPZ sector that resulted from an acute shortage of labor. It is important to&#13;
have some degree of exchange rate flexibility.&#13;
   At the same time, the exchange rate should be held fairly stable for several reasons. Al-&#13;
though a depreciation of the Mauritian rupee may boost the competitiveness of certain sectors&#13;
(for example, tourism), it also increases the costs of imported goods and services in Mauritian&#13;
currency units. For enterprises with a high percentage of imported inputs, the costs of produc-&#13;
tion increase significantly. Furthermore, depreciation increases the value of foreign debt denom-&#13;
inated in Mauritian rupees. The variability in the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate cre-&#13;
ates uncertainty in the business environment and adds to transaction costs. Hence, there is a&#13;
need to stabilize the exchange rate, and there is limited scope to have recourse to depreciation as&#13;
a means to become more competitive.&#13;
   The most appropriate way to increase export competitiveness in Mauritius is to raise labor&#13;
productivity. This is true for the following reasons. First, a number of measures can be taken to&#13;
raise productivity at the enterprise, sector, and national levels. (Measures applicable to Mauri-&#13;
tius, taking into account its 2000­02 stage of development, are discussed in the next section.)&#13;
Second, some of those measures can be effective in the short term, others in the medium term,&#13;
and still others over the long run. Therefore, the instruments chosen can be tailored to the time&#13;
frame desired for an improvement in competitiveness. Third, increasing productivity will act&#13;
directly on production costs. All things being equal, a rise in labor productivity automatically&#13;
implies an increase in competitiveness if we measure competitiveness by unit labor cost.&#13;
   Among the three policies outlined above, the most sustainable and desirable way to become&#13;
more competitive is to raise labor productivity because doing so raises the standard of living.&#13;
Currency devaluation and wage reductions lower the standard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy Measures to Increase Export Productivity and Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
In this section we will look at macroeconomic stability, human resource development, reduced&#13;
transaction costs, infrastructure development, export diversification, quality improvement, and&#13;
upgrades in technology as means of improving Mauritian productivity and ability to compete&#13;
in the marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   MACROECONOMIC STABILITY. An important first element in a policy mix aimed at improving&#13;
productivity and competitiveness is the need to maintain macroeconomic stability in Mauritius.&#13;
A stable, predictable macroeconomic environment is indispensable for improved export com-&#13;
petitiveness, but the situation is asymmetric: macroeconomic stability cannot ensure competi-&#13;
tiveness, and macroeconomic instability inevitably hurts competitiveness. Stability creates a&#13;
business environment free of uncertainty and unanticipated costs. A stable macroeconomic en-&#13;
vironment would entail low rates of inflation, low interest rates for loans, low exchange rate&#13;
variations, a reduced debt service ratio, a low budget deficit as a percent of GDP, and balance of&#13;
payments stability.&#13;
   In Mauritius, great efforts have been made to lower the rate of inflation to a reasonable level.&#13;
The country's inflation rate in 2003 was 3.9 percent, compared with 6.4 percent in 2002. For fis-&#13;
cal 2002/03, the Mauritian authorities adopted an expansionary monetary policy stance to in-&#13;
crease the level of investment in the country. Interest rates were reduced significantly. Low in-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
110   How to Improve Export Competitiveness in Mauritius&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
terest rates are a main source of competitiveness for Mauritian enterprises because they lower&#13;
production costs. The country's nominal exchange rate has tended toward a general increase&#13;
over the past decade and that has promoted exports. As was discussed above, currency depreci-&#13;
ation tends to increase the cost of imported goods and to increase foreign debt contracted in&#13;
Mauritian rupees. That explains the need for stabilization of the exchange rate.&#13;
    In summary, Mauritius's current monetary policy should take into account the following&#13;
measures that tend to ensure export growth:&#13;
&#13;
    · Inflation: the need to maintain a low rate of inflation&#13;
    · Interest rate: the importance of having low interest rates and the need to follow interna-&#13;
       tional trends in determining interest rate levels&#13;
    · Exchange rate: the need to allow some degree of exchange rate flexibility while ensuring&#13;
       exchange rate stabilization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    HUMAN RESOURCE SKILL DEVELOPMENT. A second area of policy focus is the area of human re-&#13;
sources development through training in new skills. In a dynamic business environment, enter-&#13;
prises need to stay competitive by boosting the productivity of their workforce through retrain-&#13;
ing. In Mauritius, some efforts were made in this direction. The Industrial and Vocational&#13;
Training Board and the Export Processing Zone Development Authority were set up with a&#13;
view to increasing the skills and knowledge of the labor force. Although the former entity is&#13;
more diversified in its fields of training in specific trades, the latter entity focuses on skill acqui-&#13;
sition for EPZ employees and provides other services (such as consultancy) that accompany&#13;
training to raise the level of enterprise productivity.&#13;
    The government should be more aggressive in its training policy to meet the challenges of&#13;
the new world economic order. A survey on training (Lall and Wignaraja 1998) conducted by the&#13;
Ministry of Labor provided valuable insight into some of the specific skill needs in the Maurit-&#13;
ian textiles and garments industries (table 5.4). The skills relate to specialization in technical&#13;
fields, updated and efficient management techniques, and the ability to adapt to technological&#13;
change and increased capital intensity. In addition to those skills, such specialized support serv-&#13;
ices as export credit, management of exchange risk, insurance, and shipping are important in an&#13;
environment of increasing trade liberalization.&#13;
    Another aspect of the human resource development process that can boost productivity and&#13;
competitiveness is management development. One of the problems identified with the low lev-&#13;
el of productivity in Mauritian enterprises is the poor quality of supervisory and general man-&#13;
agement. Although a number of management institutions operate in the country, these were not&#13;
very successful in cultivating the managerial expertise needed to promote productivity. Associ-&#13;
ated with the need for management development training is a need for greater organizational&#13;
development aimed at promoting a high-performance culture, competent leadership, team-&#13;
work, planning, decision making, communication, and trust.&#13;
    Here are several concrete measures in the field of training policy that could apply to Mauritius:&#13;
&#13;
    · Creating social partnerships: the need for close collaboration among employers, workers,&#13;
       and the state to determine skill needs and the most effective ways to meet them; the&#13;
       launch of an information campaign to educate firms about skill gaps&#13;
    · Benchmarking future skill needs: the importance of having future surveys of skill needs&#13;
       benchmarked against competitor countries to identify skill gaps in potential areas of&#13;
       comparative advantage&#13;
    · Cofinancing: the need to identify means to induce individuals and enterprises to finance&#13;
       training costs because government no longer can meet the full economic burden of train-&#13;
       ing; the need to make training delivery more efficient; ideas include partial cost recovery&#13;
       of service approaches for turning around ineffective public sector training institutions&#13;
       and assistance to industry associations that launch training centers&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                         Marilyn Whan-Kan   111&#13;

&#13;
    · Prioritizing cost effectiveness: the need for government to prioritize its training expendi-&#13;
       tures; also involves decentralizing decision making and increasing the participation of&#13;
       private training providers, both of which require considerable government support and&#13;
       monitoring of standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    REDUCTION IN TRANSACTION COSTS AND DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE. Another policy area&#13;
to increase competitiveness in Mauritius is related to the reduction of bureaucratic red tape that&#13;
increases transaction costs. Beginning in the 1980s, attempts have been made to reduce bureau-&#13;
cratic red tape in Mauritius, including the successful implementation of the TradeNet system at&#13;
customs and the establishment of the Board of Investment. Bolder measures have to be imple-&#13;
mented, however, because bureaucratic impediments to obtaining permits and licenses and the&#13;
considerable delays in project approvals hinder investment. Many institutions need to be ra-&#13;
tionalized and modernized to cope with economic globalization. The public sector reform,&#13;
which began in the early 2000s, should be made more credible and should be accompanied by&#13;
public sector employees' total involvement in the process.&#13;
    A related area of operation is the improvement of the physical infrastructure. In 2000, Mau-&#13;
ritius had a road density of 1.02 kilometers per square kilometer, which did not compare favor-&#13;
ably with that of small economies like Singapore (4.71 km/sq. km.). A sharp increase in the fleet&#13;
of vehicles resulted in severe congestion along the main corridors. Business activities and pro-&#13;
ductivity are affected adversely by traffic congestion. Poor transportation as well as poor social&#13;
services (such as health care) have been identified as factors resulting in worker absenteeism,&#13;
tardiness, low motivation, and low productivity. An efficient infrastructure is needed for im-&#13;
proved export competitiveness.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112    How to Improve Export Competitiveness in Mauritius&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The outdated system for providing the main utilities and the resulting high prices are major&#13;
drawbacks to Mauritian competitiveness. The environment for electricity and telecommunica-&#13;
tions does not compare with that of the country's market rivals. Although there has been a sig-&#13;
nificant fall in the price of electricity offered to the industrial sector in many countries, electrici-&#13;
ty rates in Mauritius have been increasing continuously. In the field of telecommunications, the&#13;
absence of competitive telecommunications in Mauritius is an impediment to the use of infor-&#13;
mation and communications technology (ICT) applications in existing sectors, such as sugar&#13;
and textiles. Table 5.5 reveals the marked deterioration of various ICT indicators in Mauritius&#13;
from 1999 to 2000.&#13;
    In addition, the costs of basic telephony and Internet do not compare favorably with those of&#13;
comparable countries, such as Chile and Malaysia.&#13;
    Overall recommendations to reduce transaction costs and to improve infrastructure in Mau-&#13;
ritius include these:&#13;
&#13;
    · Public sector reform: the effective implementation of an appropriate public sector reform to&#13;
        reduce red-tape bureaucracy&#13;
    · Privatization: the privatization of infrastructure through public-private partnerships, such&#13;
        as build-operate-transfer and build-operate-own-transfer schemes&#13;
    · Establishment of appropriate user charges: cost-reflective tariff levels and structures to pro-&#13;
        mote more efficient use of infrastructure services, to direct investment decisions effec-&#13;
        tively throughout the economy, and to strengthen the financial viability and accountabil-&#13;
        ity of infrastructure enterprises&#13;
    · Government expenditure on infrastructure: the need for the government to invest a given&#13;
        percentage of GDP in new infrastructure, such as port and airport facilities, and to main-&#13;
        tain existing infrastructure, such as roads and electricity supply&#13;
    · Pursuit of possible finance source: consideration of the role of the African Development&#13;
        Bank in financing private infrastructure projects in Africa&#13;
    · Use of the regional infrastructure network: the need to explore the possible use of the network&#13;
        to develop infrastructure; this could lead to cost reductions through economies of scale&#13;
    · ICT: the need to develop ICT policies that will help Mauritius reduce transaction costs,&#13;
        provide opportunities to increase exports, and open up wider markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    DIVERSIFICATION, QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, AND TECHNOLOGICAL UPGRADING. Mauritius long has&#13;
specialized in industrial activities that have limited learning potential and spillover benefits.&#13;
Both sugar and textiles activities involve low technology and low skills. Another policy measure&#13;
to increase the productivity and competitiveness of Mauritian exports is diversification and&#13;
product differentiation. Since the 1980s, Mauritius has tried to diversify its exports through the&#13;
production and export of new products, such as canned food, processed fish, precious stones,&#13;

&#13;
jewelry, and leather goods. These exports, however, constitute a negligible share of GDP and&#13;
have increased very slowly over time. For the diversification and product differentiation strate-&#13;
gy to be successful, the country has to develop and move into products or activities that require&#13;
a higher level of skills and produce a higher level of added value, that are associated with a&#13;
higher level of quality, or that are technology based.&#13;
    Mauritian authorities should focus on improving the quality of all aspects of the production&#13;
process as a basis for competitiveness. Continuous improvement of product and process quali-&#13;
ty plays a leading role in successful global manufacturing as firms pursue faster product devel-&#13;
opment with higher levels of product quality--all at lower cost. Standards and technical regula-&#13;
tions are essential to trade and the diffusion of technology. Mauritian products need to&#13;
demonstrate compliance with international standards and technical regulations as large buyers&#13;
increasingly demand evidence of compliance with international standards. Practical measures&#13;
to encourage quality improvement include the following:&#13;
&#13;
    · Attention focused on quality: increasing awareness among small and medium enterprises&#13;
       (SMEs) that quality in processes leads to a reduction in waste and, ultimately, to cost&#13;
       reductions&#13;
    · Provision of incentives: granting tax or financial incentives to SMEs that adopt ISO 9000&#13;
       quality management and total quality management practices; encouraging SMEs to im-&#13;
       prove their products and processes by the use of testing and measurement services and&#13;
       technical extension services&#13;
    · Clusters: promoting the development of industrial links between SMEs and large compa-&#13;
       nies through clusters that aim at improving overall competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
    One of the problems associated with low productivity and the lack of competitiveness in&#13;
Mauritian enterprises is the use of old technology in the production process. Therefore, another&#13;
policy recommendation is to provide financial and technical support for enterprises to retool&#13;
and modernize their operations. Such retooling and modernizing would involve the use of in-&#13;
formation technology and new machines and equipment in the production process, and the&#13;
adoption of technological methods in the agroprocessing and agriculture sector. Upgrading ex-&#13;
isting technology is a process of moving from the slow productivity growth associated with labor-&#13;
intensive or resource-intensive lines of production to high productivity growth.&#13;
    Mauritius has to consider the following measures when addressing the technological up-&#13;
grading of its exports:&#13;
&#13;
    · Support for enterprises: government provision of tax or financial incentives (such as loans)&#13;
       to SMEs to enable them to adopt new technology; also, full technical support provided to&#13;
       enterprises by relevant organizations, with staffing by technical experts; efforts to secure&#13;
       technical assistance from foreign countries and organizations, such as the Common-&#13;
       wealth Secretariat&#13;
    · Foreign direct investment: attracting export-oriented foreign investment is a shortcut method&#13;
       for building export competitiveness through technological upgrading; domestic affiliates&#13;
       of multinational corporations are better placed to acquire export capabilities because of&#13;
       their ready access to "ownership" advantages, such as their parent corporations' tech-&#13;
       nologies and marketing know-how&#13;
    · Skill supply: an adequate supply of workers with the needed skills on which to base a shift&#13;
       in the production pattern&#13;
    · Control of social costs: upgrading imposes important social costs because it involves an ini-&#13;
       tial period during which resources are shifted to outputs produced at low factor produc-&#13;
       tivities until the learning process takes over; because these social costs must be con-&#13;
       trolled, technological "jumps" cannot be too large.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114   How to Improve Export Competitiveness in Mauritius&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
Policy support probably is the most important driver of export success. In Mauritius, the Na-&#13;
tional Productivity and Competitiveness Council is the coordinating body on matters of pro-&#13;
ductivity and competitiveness, and it formulates strategy and monitors policy implementation.&#13;
The council will be called on to play a much more active role in an economic environment char-&#13;
acterized by fast globalization and trade liberalization.&#13;
   In this report, we have shown that productivity improvement is the most appropriate strate-&#13;
gy for making Mauritian exports more competitive in the world marketplace. Basically, produc-&#13;
tivity and competitiveness increase by ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment, investing&#13;
in human resource development and skill formation, reducing transaction costs, developing in-&#13;
frastructure, and diversifying exports mainly through quality and technology.&#13;
   Institutions will have to play a key role in promoting productivity growth and competitive-&#13;
ness in Mauritius. The government needs to stabilize the economy, stabilize the exchange rate,&#13;
improve the industrial training system, reduce bureaucratic procedures, and provide tax incen-&#13;
tives. The labor unions must provide responsible leadership, educate workers to be more pro-&#13;
ductive, and promote the linking of wage increases with productivity improvements. Private&#13;
sector organizations should encourage good management practices in enterprises, promote&#13;
greater collaboration with the government, lobby for more incentives, and invest in training. In-&#13;
ternational development institutions will have to consider the possibility of financing projects&#13;
and programs to improve productivity and competitiveness in the country, especially in the&#13;
areas of infrastructure and technical assistance.&#13;
   The challenge requires that policy makers establish and maintain appropriate links and co-&#13;
herence among actions taken in these policy areas. A coherent, market-oriented competitiveness&#13;
strategy in small states is vital to success in international markets.&#13;

Export Performance and Economic Growth in Ethiopia&#13;

This report examines export performance and economic growth in Ethiopia, using a multivariate time-&#13;
series approach within a production function framework. Given the significant role of the export sector in&#13;
the country's economy, the study used cointegration and a vector error correction model to analyze real&#13;
data for total exports, gross domestic product, imports, gross capital formation, exchange rate, and popu-&#13;
lation over the period 1960/61 to 2003/04. Consistent with expectations, export growth was positively re-&#13;
lated with output growth, regardless of the specification of the export variable. The results obtained cast&#13;
doubt on previous studies arguing that a positive and significant link in export and economic growth is&#13;
achieved when the country studied is exporting manufactured products. Even then, this report suggests&#13;
that Ethiopia should spare no effort to bring about economic transformation, to increase production, and&#13;
to diversify its exports on a rapid and sustainable basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The performance of sub-Saharan African economies is dismal as a result of many factors: deteri-&#13;
orated economic growth, higher population growth, slow technological progress, a dwindling&#13;
per capita income, low capital formation, low productivity, abysmal poverty, political instabili-&#13;
ty, and inept economic policies. Promoting sustainable growth and instituting structural trans-&#13;
formation are means of redressing this poor economic condition. Diversifying and promoting&#13;
exports also can contribute to economic growth. Enhancing the efficiency of domestic savings&#13;
and channeling them into investments in various sectors is essential.&#13;
    Like other sub-Saharan African economies, the Ethiopian economy is agriculture based and&#13;
relies highly on earnings from fragmented household agricultural activities. To a great extent,&#13;
the performance of the economy is guided by the performance of the agricultural sector; good&#13;
performance in that sector is considered better performance by the entire economy because the&#13;
sector contributes about 50 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 85 percent of em-&#13;
ployment opportunities.&#13;
    Agricultural commodities dominate Ethiopia's export basket, supplying 80­90 percent of the&#13;
merchandise export earnings. Coffee, the principal export product, generates more than half of&#13;
the foreign exchange earnings, although the crop has became subject to internal and external&#13;
shocks. For example, the value of coffee exported grew, on average, by 19.0 percent during the&#13;

period 1993/94 through 1997/98, and it declined by 26.9 percent in 1999/2000. The share of&#13;
noncoffee exports increased remarkably over the period 1998/99 through 1999/2000 because of&#13;
a drop in coffee export earnings and a rise in earnings from these new commodities being sold&#13;
overseas (EEA/EEPRI 2002, pp. 27­28). The decline in the coffee share, however, does not mean&#13;
that transformation was occurring; the share dwindled partly as a result of a decline in the in-&#13;
ternational market price for coffee.&#13;
    Other major export commodities in Ethiopia include hides and skins, chat, pulses and&#13;
oilseeds, fruits, and vegetables. The share of hides and skins, the major manufactured export&#13;
product, is declining despite the country having a large livestock population. Chat is becoming&#13;
one of the most important sources of foreign currency earnings and is competing with coffee for&#13;
land resources; some farmers are ceasing the growing of coffee to grow chat (Nega, Moges, and&#13;
Gebeyehu 2002). The lack of physical and marketing infrastructure suppresses export perform-&#13;
ance and economic growth by limiting the ability of farmers to increase their earnings.&#13;
    Nonagricultural exports make up a very small share of the total exports, and this implies the&#13;
dearth of structural transformation. The capacity of exports is declining, which leads to higher&#13;
debt levels (Nega, Moges, and Gebeyehu 2002) and suggests that the country is unable to create&#13;
a dynamic and competent industrial sector.&#13;
    Ethiopia's major manufacturing export commodities are leather and leather products, frozen&#13;
meat, sugar, and textiles. A study of the leather industry has shown that the tanning and leather&#13;
manufacturing industry runs at partial capacity because of a shortage of hides and skins cou-&#13;
pled with poor quality standards (Gebre-Michael 2004). Ethiopia exports raw hides and skins&#13;
and imports about 30 percent of the aggregate footwear supply. This fact implies a policy incon-&#13;
sistency in relation to the subsector. Textile manufacturing industries also run at partial capaci-&#13;
ty, largely owing to structural problems. From 1980 to 2000, Ethiopia did not succeed in increas-&#13;
ing its manufactured exports, although the share of manufactured products in total exports for&#13;
the developing countries as a whole expanded almost fourfold in that period (Gebre-Michael&#13;
2004). The industrial sector accounts for merely 12.0 percent of GDP, 22.0 percent of foreign ex-&#13;
change earnings, and 9.5 percent of employment opportunities. The sector is oriented primarily&#13;
toward the processing of agricultural commodities, followed by petroleum refining and the&#13;
production of textiles.&#13;
    The Ethiopian economy has experienced three distinct growth chapters exemplified by the&#13;
three regimes that ruled the country during the period 1960/61 through 2003/04. The different&#13;
policy prescriptions pursued by the different regimes did not produce the required results;&#13;
rather, the growth of the economy remained unsatisfactory.&#13;
    The country recorded a promising growth performance during the imperial regime (1960/61­&#13;
1973/74), but that growth was halted in the mid-1970s (table 6.1). In the period 1974/75­&#13;
1990/91, especially, overall economic performance was gloomy and real aggregate variables de-&#13;
celerated. Average real GDP growth dwindled to 1.8 percent a year--a meager amount to sustain&#13;
the prevailing level of per capita income. Real per capita GDP slowed by 0.84 percent while popu-&#13;

lation grew at about 2.8 percent annually. The ratios of government revenue and government ex-&#13;
penditure to GDP were 22.0 percent and 30.2 percent, respectively. This deceleration in the econo-&#13;
my compelled the country to resort to both domestic and foreign borrowing to finance the mount-&#13;
ing fiscal deficit. Large decelerations of per capita income were recorded in 1984/85 as a result of&#13;
drought/famine. In 1990/91, such decelerations were attributed to civil war and political instabil-&#13;
ity. The average growth of real GDP in the periods 1960/61­1973/74 and 1991/92­2003/04 was&#13;
3.87 percent and 5.92 percent, respectively.&#13;
    In 1992, Ethiopia embarked on a reform package intended to reverse deteriorating economic&#13;
conditions and to put the economy on a sustainable growth trajectory. Since that time, the gov-&#13;
ernment has contained spending, reduced tariffs and military expenditures, improved tax col-&#13;
lection, reformed the investment code and the tax laws, and introduced a market-based system&#13;
to allocate urban land. It has made an effort to stimulate private sector development by launch-&#13;
ing a privatization process and establishing a number of agencies to facilitate privatizing. In&#13;
2008, however, the economy remains weak and sensitive to shocks, specifically drought and&#13;
commodity price instability. Real GDP skyrocketed to 7.7 percent in 2000/01, but then it stag-&#13;
gered at a rate of 1.2 percent in fiscal year 2001/02 and constricted by about 3.8 percent in&#13;
2002/03. Following the 2002/03 drought, agricultural production value added dropped by 12.2&#13;
percent because of a 25.0 percent fall in the production of cereals, pulses, and oilseeds. Poor&#13;
growth performance in 2001/02 and the fall of agricultural production in 2002/03 caused the&#13;
average real GDP growth for the period 1997/98­2002/03 to decelerate to 2.5 percent.&#13;
    Likewise, the overall performance of the export sector has been gloomy in the period&#13;
1960/61 through 2003/04 as a result of structural problems and policy constraints. On average,&#13;
exports contributed about 14 percent to GDP during the periods under study. From 1960/61 to&#13;
1973/74, export earnings covered more than 90 percent of the country's import bills and, in&#13;
some years, actually registered a surplus. This fact supports the view that diversifying exports&#13;
eases foreign exchange constraints and stimulates the country's economic growth. The contri-&#13;
bution of exports to the financing of imports has been contracting continuously over the subse-&#13;
quent years, reaching approximately 45.1 percent in fiscal 2001/02. In the same year, merchan-&#13;
dise imports swelled to 11.7 percent as a result of current account liberalization and the&#13;
availability of foreign resources. The country's major imported commodities include fuel, capi-&#13;
tal goods, and raw materials. The decline in export revenue, relative to the steady rise in the im-&#13;
port bill, not only widened the balance of trade deficit but also restrained the import of essential&#13;
intermediate and capital goods. The widening gap between imports and exports has exacerbat-&#13;
ed the rise of external financing in the form of aid and credit.&#13;
    During the period 1960/61­2003/04, the real value of goods and services exported grew at&#13;
an average rate of 13.04 percent. There was a modest growth of total export value prior to 1974;&#13;
the average annual growth rate of real export value was 8.2 percent. That rate dwindled to 4.7&#13;
percent during the period 1974/75­1990/91 and went up in the period 1991/92­2003/04.&#13;
    Not only is the export pattern dominated by primary commodities; there also is a market&#13;
concentration of the country's exports, making the country vulnerable to the economic condi-&#13;
tions (demand) of its trading partners. Europe remains Ethiopia's major export destination, ac-&#13;
counting for nearly half of its total exports. Belgium, England, France, Germany, and Italy ac-&#13;
count for more than 85 percent of total exports to the European market. Export share to the&#13;
Asian market has grown remarkably. For instance, the share of exports to Asia rose from 17.0&#13;
percent in 1980 to about 32.3 percent in 1997­2002. Japan and Saudi Arabia import more than 70&#13;
percent of Ethiopia's total exports to the Asian market.&#13;
    The country has failed to use the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which offers duty-&#13;
and quota-free access to the United States market for a wide range of manufactured products,&#13;
including textiles, apparel, and leather products. Ethiopia's total export share to Africa is low,&#13;
implying its failure to exploit the comparative advantage arising from geographic proximity.&#13;
The country's concentration of export destinations suggests that Ethiopia has not improved its&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
international competitiveness and that the country is more susceptible to shocks that occur in&#13;
the economies of its trading partners.&#13;
    Generally speaking, the country needs to find ways to diversify and radically augment its&#13;
exports on a sustainable basis. Although its economic reform program has focused on making&#13;
exports an engine of growth, the government's attempts do not seem to have produced the re-&#13;
quired results. Whether exports determine GDP growth is a question that needs to be probed&#13;
empirically; to the best of my knowledge, however, no such investigation has been made to test&#13;
the causal connection between exports and economic growth in the Ethiopian context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Objective, Scope, and Significance of the Study, and Organization of the Report&#13;
&#13;
The objectives of this study are to examine the relationship between export performance and&#13;
economic growth, using cointegration and vector error correction techniques, and to highlight&#13;
possible areas of intervention to promote export diversification and growth.&#13;
    The scope of the study is limited to examining the relationship between export performance&#13;
and economic growth in Ethiopia for the fiscal years 1960/61­2003/04.&#13;
    It is hoped that the information provided by this study will help policy makers design ap-&#13;
propriate initiatives, and that the work will serve as a reference to subsequent research efforts in&#13;
the area of export-led growth.&#13;
    The report is organized as follows. The next section presents a review of relevant literature&#13;
on the export-growth nexus. That review is followed by brief accounts of the export policy in&#13;
Ethiopia, organized around three specific time periods. The types and sources of data and the&#13;
empirical methodology used in this study are then described in detail. The study results are pre-&#13;
sented next, followed by a section of conclusions and recommendations.&#13;

&#13;
Literature Review&#13;
&#13;
Theoretical Literature: General Foreign Trade&#13;
&#13;
According to classical economic theory, trade benefits a country by enabling it to specialize in&#13;
areas of comparative advantage. To put that another way, a country engaged in trade specializes&#13;
in what it does best, sells it in the international market, and imports goods that cannot easily be&#13;
produced locally. Countries engaged in trade possess a surplus productive capacity that ex-&#13;
ceeds their domestic consumption requirements. A surplus productive capacity suitable for the&#13;
export market appears to be a costless means of acquiring imports of new productive inputs&#13;
and expanding domestic economic activity (Myint 1958). Hence, trade enables countries to ben-&#13;
efit from their differences in factor endowments by giving them an outlet for goods that require&#13;
many of the factors in which they are relatively rich.&#13;
    By opening up channels of communication that would not otherwise exist with producers in&#13;
other countries, trade enables countries to take advantage of spillovers in research and develop-&#13;
ment--spillovers that produce indispensable benefits to developing countries (Grossman and&#13;
Helpman 1991a,b; Rivera-Batiz and Romer 1991). Trade facilitates the absorption of technologi-&#13;
cal improvements and global best management practices, and it opens channels of communica-&#13;
tion that stimulate learning about production methods, better terms of organization, product&#13;
design, market conditions, and so forth (Ben-David and Loewy 1998; Hart 1983; Lucas 1988;&#13;
Tyler 1981). As Grossman and Helpman (1991a,b) argued, technological spillovers may come&#13;
through imports as easily as through exports. One species of technology transfer is the capabili-&#13;
ty of developing countries to imitate the production of higher-quality goods developed in the&#13;
advanced economies (Evenson and Singh 1997; Fafchamps 2000).&#13;
    However, the idea that trade fosters economic growth through comparative advantage,&#13;
economies of scale, and specialization was challenged in the early 1970s. Morton and Tulloch&#13;
(1977) argued that because production in developing countries is highly tied with primary agri-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                    Kagnew Wolde   121&#13;

&#13;
cultural commodities, specialization and trade do not offer the same benefits. Rather, they&#13;
would cause underdeveloped economies to remain underdeveloped. As a result, industrializa-&#13;
tion strategy received particular attention.&#13;
   In the 1950s and 1960s, many developing countries actively pursued an inward-looking in-&#13;
dustrialization (import-substitution) policy--a policy that called for the imposition of signifi-&#13;
cant barriers to foreign trade and a substitution of domestic output for imports (using a variety&#13;
of policy instruments, such as Prebisch [1950] and Singer [1950])--as a panacea to foster their&#13;
economies and satisfy the domestic market. They thought that productivity would be higher in&#13;
the industrial sector than in other sectors. Import substitution was believed, in the long run, to&#13;
save scarce foreign currencies that would be allocated for imports of investment goods. The&#13;
strategy called for shifting resources from imported goods toward domestically produced&#13;
goods. The strategy also might have been useful for low-income countries with a small indus-&#13;
trial base that exported traditional primary products. The opposite would be true for semi-&#13;
industrial countries whose exports already included an increasing quantity of manufactured&#13;
goods (Bhagwati 1986).&#13;
   The growth experience of individual countries shed doubt on the strategy's effectiveness in&#13;
the 1970s. Trade deficits widened, employment ceased to grow, and the balance of payments&#13;
worsened because intermediate inputs had to be imported to supply the newly established fac-&#13;
tories (Promfret 1997). The import-substitution strategy led to a decline in the output of devel-&#13;
oping countries and to inefficiency and resource misallocation by reducing competitiveness and&#13;
increasing costs. A narrow domestic market also contributed to the failure of this strategy.&#13;
   Cross-country studies correlate outward-orientation with economic growth. The theoretical&#13;
underpinning of outward-orientation (where a country opens its markets to the rest of the&#13;
world and boosts its exports) relies on the effect of trade restrictions in reducing economic&#13;
growth by distorting the pattern of resource allocation and by limiting the scope of innovation&#13;
and technical progress (Edwards 1993). Under an inward-oriented strategy, scholars argue, do-&#13;
mestic firms lose the opportunity to benefit from economies of scale and their scope of operation&#13;
diminishes because they are encouraged to produce for the domestic market (Bhagwati 1988;&#13;
Gwartney and Lawson 2002; Krueger 1978, 1995; Krugman and Obstfeld 2003). Foreign trade,&#13;
however, not only enables domestic firms to enlarge their markets and expand through sales to&#13;
the rest of the world, but also establishes new external markets and thereby produces opportu-&#13;
nities for industrialization and fast growth. An outward-looking strategy leads to increased&#13;
competition from abroad, which could lead to welfare gains by reducing the deadweight losses&#13;
emanating from monopolies and oligopolies--and so produce another source of growth.&#13;
   Beginning in the mid- to late-1970s, many developing countries undertook trade liberaliza-&#13;
tion and pursued export-oriented strategies. Accordingly, the composition of exports from de-&#13;
veloping economies started to shift from primary commodities to manufactures and services.&#13;
Trade liberalization induced economic growth by facilitating technology transfer, international&#13;
integration of production, and the associated possibility of reaping scale economies, reducing&#13;
price distortions, and increasing efficiency (Gebre-Michael 2004). Liberalization also could cre-&#13;
ate an environment conducive to growth because inward orientation inflicts both static costs (by&#13;
way of resource misallocation) and dynamic costs (by raising the incremental capital output ra-&#13;
tios and depriving access to advanced technology).&#13;
   On average, countries more open to international trade have a more rapid rate of economic&#13;
growth. As Gwartney and Lawson (2002) found, the most open economies in the world had annu-&#13;
al per capita income growth rates of 2.0 percent during the 1990s, whereas the least open ones grew&#13;
merely 0.2 percent during the same period. Frankel and Romer (1999) found that a unit percentage&#13;
rise in the ratio of international trade to GDP increased per capita income by at least 0.05 percent.&#13;
   Other studies, in contrast, concluded that the lack of openness does not constrain economic&#13;
growth in developing countries. However, counties that have positioned themselves well in&#13;
terms of their overall development performance, export patterns, skilled human resource en-&#13;

&#13;
dowments, and institutional and physical infrastructure would be better off with more open-&#13;
ness than with protectionism. Birdsall (2002, quoted in Gebre-Michael [2004]) found that al-&#13;
though many developing economies have been "open" for more than two decades, the value of&#13;
their exports has remained stagnant or even declined over that period--conspicuous evidence&#13;
of no growth at all since 1980. In terms of growth and poverty reduction, the performance of&#13;
most natural resource production-based countries was poor, no matter how "open" they were in&#13;
their trade and economic policies. The experience of countries that succeeded in developing do-&#13;
mestic industries also shows that import substitution and policies for enhancing exports and&#13;
better integrating with the rest of the world complement each other. An appropriate govern-&#13;
ment policy conducive to nurturing competitive industries and upgrading technologies in ex-&#13;
isting industries (such as policies that encourage supply links between domestic firms and sub-&#13;
sidiaries of multinational corporations) is a critical factor for the industrial sector in developing&#13;
countries to achieve this dual role (Wade 2002, quoted in Gebre-Michael [2004]).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Theoretical Literature: Specific Exports&#13;
&#13;
Whether export is an engine of economic growth has been a contentious issue in the growth lit-&#13;
erature for various reasons (see, for example, Buffie 1992; Jaffee 1985; Keesing 1967; Riezman,&#13;
Whiteman, and Summers 1996), and there are scholars who support import-substitution strate-&#13;
gy to foster development (Prebisch 1950; Singer 1950). Proponents of the export-led growth the-&#13;
ory argue for the existence of a strong correlation between exports and economic growth; they&#13;
believe that the export sector plays a key role in enhancing overall economic performance. Ex-&#13;
port expansion fosters higher total factor productivity growth (Krueger 1978; Ram 1987) and&#13;
better use of resources by offering the potential for economies of scale (Helpman and Krugman&#13;
1985; Sharma and Panagiotidis 2004). If there were incentives to increase investment and im-&#13;
prove technology, it would imply a productivity differential in favor of the export sector. Thus,&#13;
an expansion of exports, even at the cost of other sectors, will have a net positive effect on the&#13;
rest of the economy (Sharma and Panagiotidis 2004).&#13;
    Exports may benefit economic growth by generating positive externalities on nonexports&#13;
(Feder 1983), bringing about technological progress through foreign competition (Kavoussi&#13;
1984; Moschos 1987), improved allocative efficiency, and better ability to generate dynamic&#13;
comparative advantage (Sharma and Panagiotidis 2004). The study by Balassa (1978) supported&#13;
the positive external benefits of exports (greater capacity utilization, incentives for technological&#13;
improvement, and management that is more efficient) attributed to the competitive pressures of&#13;
foreign markets. Exports ease foreign exchange constraints to allow the import of high-quality&#13;
intermediate inputs for domestic production and exports (Chenery and Strout 1966), and there-&#13;
by can provide greater access to international markets, thus expanding the economy's produc-&#13;
tion possibilities (McKinnon 1964).&#13;
    According to Esfahani (1991), export enables developing countries to relieve the import&#13;
shortage they may face--that is, revenue from exports fill the "foreign exchange gap" that is&#13;
perceived as a barrier to growth. Export growth also may enhance efficiency and thus lead to an&#13;
increase in real output (Jung and Marshall 1985).&#13;
    As depicted in figure 6.1, all things being equal, an increase of exports will trigger a rise of in-&#13;
come, which may lead in turn to&#13;
&#13;
    1. A rise in consumption because households are richer. Consumption growth, in turn, im-&#13;
       plies an increase of income (Keynesian multiplier).&#13;
    2. A rise in employment because more production requires more labor.&#13;
    3. An increase in household savings.&#13;
    4. A widening tax base that aids the government by increasing tax revenue. At normal lev-&#13;
       els of public expenditure, this means a reduced deficit or even a surplus for the govern-&#13;
       ment budget.&#13;

Empirical Studies&#13;
&#13;
A series of empirical studies has been conducted to investigate the effect of export growth on&#13;
economic growth. Results were mixed. Earlier studies validated the export-led growth hypoth-&#13;
esis on the basis of a high correlation between the export and income variables. More recent em-&#13;
pirical works emphasizing the direction of causality between export and economic growth have&#13;
produced results that are mixed and even contradictory (Giles and Williams 2000). Some re-&#13;
searchers discovered a significant link between export and economic growth, and others refut-&#13;
ed the hypothesis. Many of the studies conducted in the 1990s found no long-term relationship&#13;
between exports and economic growth; rather, they found that the link came only from a posi-&#13;
tive short-run relationship between variables. (See Giles and Williams [2000] for a list of studies,&#13;
including Ahmad and Harnhirun [1992], Oxley [1993], and Rashid [1995].)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Similarly, the methods used in various studies differ. Earlier works used bivariate correlation&#13;
(the Spearman rank correlation test) in a cross-country format to test for the export-led growth&#13;
hypothesis (Heller and Porter 1978; Kravis 1970; Lussier 1993; Michaely 1977). Other investiga-&#13;
tors explained the relationship within a neoclassical framework. In most of those studies (Balas-&#13;
sa 1985; Ram 1987; Tyler 1981), export was included in an ad hoc manner in the production func-&#13;
tion to take account of a broad measure of externalities and productivity gains generated by the&#13;
sector that fosters the domestic economy. The majority of these studies used the ordinary least&#13;
squares (OLS) technique on cross-section data and used their results to support the outward-&#13;
looking strategy against an import-substitution strategy. Other researchers used the Granger&#13;
causality approach (Ahmad and Kwan 1991; Chow 1987; Hsiao 1987) and error correction meth-&#13;
ods (Bahmani-Oskooee and Alse 1993; Hachicha 2003; Michael 2002; Thungswan and Thom-&#13;
spon 2002) to investigate the link between exports and economic growth.&#13;
   Michaely (1977) used a cross-section data set for a sample of 41 countries, applied the Spear-&#13;
man rank correlation coefficient, and found a positive and significant relationship between ex-&#13;
ports and economic growth among the more developed economies, but not among the least de-&#13;
veloped ones. He concluded that export performance affects output growth when countries&#13;
attain some minimum level of development. Balassa (1978, 1985) found a positive correlation&#13;
coefficient between export expansion and output, using the data from 11 and 43 developing&#13;
countries, respectively.&#13;
   Tyler (1981), taking a sample of 55 middle-income economies, found a positive and signifi-&#13;
cant relationship between export and income growth. Feder (1983) developed an analytical&#13;
framework to test the export-growth relationship for 31 semi-industrial, less-developed coun-&#13;
tries, using the following variables: investment as a share of income, rate of growth of the labor&#13;
force, and rate of growth of exports (times exports as a share of GDP). He incorporated the pos-&#13;
sibility that the marginal factor productivities are not equal in the export and nonexport sectors&#13;
of the economy. The regression coefficient of the export variable was statistically highly signifi-&#13;
cant. This finding led him strongly to support the hypothesis that marginal factor productivities&#13;
are higher in the export sector than in the nonexport sector.&#13;
   Kavoussi (1984) considered 73 middle- and low-income developing countries and found a&#13;
strong effect of export growth on output growth in both sets of countries. The effects, however,&#13;
tended to diminish according to the level of development. Esfahani (1991) used a sample of 31&#13;
semi-industrial countries and employed a simultaneous equation model to deal with the simul-&#13;
taneity problem between GDP and export growth. He found that the economic growth of most&#13;
of the sample countries was largely the result of the import supply effects of exports.&#13;
   Country-specific studies are quite scarce. More recent studies have used time-series data&#13;
from specific countries because pooling different countries may give rise to a misleading con-&#13;
clusion. The results from cross-section data based on bivariate models or an ad hoc aggregate&#13;
production function generally agreed on the positive association between export expansion and&#13;
economic growth. However, empirical results obtained from country-specific studies strongly&#13;
differed between countries and periods studied (Shan and Sun 1998). Such a disparity may im-&#13;
ply that although cross-section studies are empirically attractive for researchers, the researchers&#13;
could observe intercountry differences and so sacrifice revealing information about the behav-&#13;
ior of many countries (Medina-Smith 2001). Cross-section studies fail to provide useful country-&#13;
specific information to policy makers in developing countries, and the results are subject to dis-&#13;
pute because of their limited sample sizes. Even those studies with larger samples were limited&#13;
to specific types of developing countries (most of the researchers choose middle-income coun-&#13;
tries and oil exporters) (Medina-Smith 2001).&#13;
   In a country-specific study using a sample of 73 low- and middle-income, less-developed&#13;
countries, Ram (1985) found a positive and significant export-growth link and suggested the ex-&#13;
istence of a threshold effect. Ram (1987) considered a sample of 88 low- and middle-income coun-&#13;
tries, using an OLS and production function econometric technique to study a cross-section data&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                   Kagnew Wolde 125&#13;

&#13;
set of two subperiods. The results support the export-led growth hypothesis. He asserted that the&#13;
huge intercountry differences and diversity suggest caution when interpreting the results.&#13;
    Lussier (1993) employed cross-section and panel data analysis to establish the direction of&#13;
causality between exports and real output growth, taking samples of 24 and 19 African coun-&#13;
tries. The results supported the hypothesis for panel data, but failed to find any positive link&#13;
when using export growth as a share of GDP. Bahmian-Oskooee and Alse (1994) undertook&#13;
causality tests on nine developing countries. In contrast to earlier studies, after incorporating in&#13;
the analysis the cointegrating properties of the variables considered, they found that bidirec-&#13;
tional causality between export growth and output growth received strong empirical support in&#13;
almost all countries.&#13;
    Thornton (1996) used Engle-Granger cointegration and Granger causality tests in a two-variable&#13;
framework and found a positive and significant causal relationship running from exports to eco-&#13;
nomic growth in the case of Mexico. Amoateng and Amoako-Adu (1996) ran causality tests for 35&#13;
African countries by introducing foreign debt service as a third variable within a trivariate&#13;
causality analysis of exports and economic growth. Their results showed a joint feedback effect&#13;
between export revenue, external debt service, and economic growth. The study of Doraisami&#13;
(1996) strongly supported bidirectional causality between exports and growth in Malaysia.&#13;
    Al-Yousif (1997) employed time-series analysis for four Arab Gulf countries, and the results&#13;
supported the hypothesis in the short-run but failed to find a long-run relationship (that is, did&#13;
not find cointegration). Begum and Shamsuddin (1998) conducted a study of Bangladesh, and&#13;
their results indicated that exports could induce economic growth. Shan and Sun (1998) estab-&#13;
lished a vector autoregressive model in the production function context in a study of China.&#13;
Finding a bidirectional relationship, they rejected the unidirectional export-led growth hypoth-&#13;
esis. Nonetheless, they did find that both exports and industrial output contribute positively to&#13;
each other in China.&#13;
    Chang et al. (2000) used multivariate causality analysis incorporating imports as a factor in&#13;
the relationship between exports and output in their study of Taiwan (China). They found no&#13;
support for the export-led growth hypothesis during the period of rapid growth there&#13;
(1971­95).&#13;
    Nidugala (2001), using an augmented production function with export as the regressor in a&#13;
study of India, found a significant positive impact of export growth on output growth. The re-&#13;
sults further revealed that the growth of manufactured exports had a significant positive rela-&#13;
tionship with output growth, whereas growth of primary exports had no such influence.&#13;
    Michael (2002) examined the relationship between exports, imports, and income in the econ-&#13;
omy of Trinidad and Tobago, using Granger causality and error correction modeling. His analy-&#13;
sis confirmed that incomes in Trinidad and Tobago are Granger-caused by the growth of ex-&#13;
ports. A boom in petroleum exports caused increased income and spending in the nontradable&#13;
sector of the economy. The results further indicated a bidirectional causality between exports&#13;
and imports, a long-term bidirectional causality between imports and GDP, and unidirectional&#13;
Granger causation from exports to GDP.&#13;
    Thungswan and Thompson (2002) examined the causality between exports and income in&#13;
Thailand between 1969 and 1995, using cointegration and error correction models. Their results&#13;
clearly supported the export-led growth hypothesis for agricultural exports. For manufacturing&#13;
exports, they found evidence of bidirectional causality supporting both export-led growth and&#13;
the growth-driven export hypothesis; manufacturing exports had a slightly stronger effect on&#13;
absorption than did agricultural exports.&#13;
    Alam (2003) examined the export-led growth hypothesis in a production function frame-&#13;
work focused on Mexico and Brazil, but found no evidence to support it. Imported capital&#13;
goods appeared to be very significant in the aggregate production function analysis, implying&#13;
that an increase in manufactured exports did play an important role in paying for the imports of&#13;
capital goods by relaxing the foreign exchange constraint.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   Keong, Yusop, and Liew (2003) ran a vector autoregressive model and multivariate cointe-&#13;
gration for Malaysia and found a long-run association between the variables considered. The re-&#13;
sults of the error correction model revealed that all variables, except exchange rate, Granger-&#13;
caused economic growth in the short run, and that led them to confirm the validity of the&#13;
export-led growth hypothesis in Malaysia, both in the short run and over the long term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Export Policy in Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
The governments that have ruled Ethiopia since 1960 have implemented different policies to&#13;
boost the export sector and to encourage nontraditional exports. The development strategies&#13;
and policies implemented during the pre-1991/92 periods were inward oriented, and that ori-&#13;
entation negatively affected the competitiveness of the export sector. The Ethiopian People's&#13;
Revolutionary Democratic Front, which overthrew the Derge regime and came to power in&#13;
1991/92, has undertaken a package of reforms. The state liberalized the exchange and trading&#13;
system to promote exports through diversification. A succinct review of the policies of the dif-&#13;
ferent regimes follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Periods before 1974/75&#13;
&#13;
Import substitution was a dominant strategy prior to 1974/75. The private sector, mainly for-&#13;
eign capital, had occupied the largest share of both export and import activities. The develop-&#13;
ment plan had three phases (Imperial Government of Ethiopia 1955, 1962, 1968):&#13;
&#13;
   1. The first five-year development plan (1957/58 to 1961/62): Import substitution, industrial pro-&#13;
       motion, and infrastructure such as road development were the focus of this plan; export&#13;
       promotion received only meager attention. It was acknowledged that the volume of ex-&#13;
       ports, the balance of payments position, and the level of budgetary revenue depended on&#13;
       the price movements and the extent of demand for coffee, hides and skins, and oilseeds.&#13;
       The plan envisioned export diversification by exploiting the large livestock population&#13;
       and the products of agroprocessing industries to secure an average annual export growth&#13;
       of 9 percent.&#13;
   2. The second five-year development plan (1962/63 to 1966/67): Structural change and export di-&#13;
       versification were made a priority for generating a higher level of foreign exchange earn-&#13;
       ings. New export products of industrial origins and mining products were supposed to&#13;
       play a significant role. The plan set the share of agricultural exports to be reduced to 72.3&#13;
       percent in 1966/67 (from 93.6 percent in 1962/63), and the share of manufactured prod-&#13;
       ucts to be increased to 24.2 percent (from 5.2 percent). The incentives offered to investors&#13;
       engaged in the production of nontraditional exports included profit/income tax holi-&#13;
       days, simplification of export trade licensing, and restructuring and strengthening of the&#13;
       chamber of commerce. The average annual export growth rate was expected to reach 11&#13;
       percent. The major policies devised in this period were establishing government foreign&#13;
       trade corporations; revising existing customs tariffs to protect domestic products and&#13;
       stimulate exports; directing credit, premium, and subsidy policies toward the develop-&#13;
       ment of production and promotion of exports; and concluding a series of bilateral and&#13;
       multilateral economic agreements.&#13;
   3. The third five-year development plan (1968/69 to 1973/74): Geographic diversification of tra-&#13;
       ditional export products (coffee, livestock products, and oilseeds) and the development&#13;
       of nonagricultural exports were the focus of this period. The plan envisioned reducing&#13;
       the share of traditional exports from 86 percent in 1967/68 to 75 percent in 1973/74 and&#13;
       the share of coffee from 55 percent to 40 percent in the same period, partly as a result of&#13;
       adding new export products. The measures adopted included overvaluation of the ex-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                 Kagnew Wolde  127&#13;

        change rate, high tariff rates, wide-ranging foreign exchange control, and nontariff barri-&#13;
        ers such as restrictions on some items and heavy tax on exports. The expected export di-&#13;
        versification did not happen because of structural problems the economy encountered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Derge Regime, 1974/75­1990/91&#13;
&#13;
In this period, there was restricted participation and involvement of the private sector. The&#13;
overall policies of the military regime favored the expansion of collective and public enterpris-&#13;
es, whereas private enterprises were marginalized and their participation in the country's de-&#13;
velopment efforts was kept to a minimum. The economy was managed through central plan-&#13;
ning. An inward-looking strategy behind highly protective tariffs and quantitative restrictions&#13;
was the development strategy of the day.&#13;
    The government undertook a 10-year perspective plan (1985/86 to 1994/95) with the aims of&#13;
orienting the country's export structures toward high-value-added products instead of the tra-&#13;
ditional exports and of increasing the volume and composition of manufactured exports, ex-&#13;
panding the foreign exchange earnings, and increasing the socialization of the export sector.&#13;
However, particular attention was given to state-owned export companies, no matter their inef-&#13;
ficiency. The perspective plan also placed greater emphasis on geographic diversification of ex-&#13;
ports toward the markets of socialist countries and neighboring African countries. The average&#13;
annual export growth rate was targeted at 15.4 percent, and state-owned export companies&#13;
were expected to occupy 90 percent of the export business.&#13;
    The government planned to reduce the share of traditional exports (coffee, hides and skins,&#13;
pulses and oilseeds) to 53.2 percent in 1994/95 (from 73.5 percent in 1985/86). The share of oth-&#13;
er exportables (live animals, meat products, fruits and vegetables, spices, sugar and molasses,&#13;
natural gum, chat, and others) was targeted to rise from 26.5 percent in 1985/86 to 46.8 percent&#13;
in 1994/95. New exports, such as copper, potash, marble, soda ash, cement, ceramics, and&#13;
leather products, were to be placed in the international market in the second half of the per-&#13;
spective plan.&#13;
    A number of tools were used to fulfill these objectives, including provision of favorable tax,&#13;
tariffs, and foreign exchange rate measures; improvement of export quality, quantity, and diver-&#13;
sity; and dissemination of current information on world market prices and other factors to ex-&#13;
porters and producers. Although an export subsidy plan was introduced in 1983/84, with the&#13;
aim of counterbalancing the negative effects of distortionary policies and thereby securing ex-&#13;
port growth, it was not sufficient to neutralize the prevailing anti-export bias incentive struc-&#13;
ture. The other effort considered relevant for export diversification was the 1989/90 directive&#13;
banning the export of raw hides and skins.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Periods after 1990/91&#13;
&#13;
The current ruling party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, overthrew the&#13;
military junta in 1991. It devised a new economic policy framework with the aim of reversing&#13;
deteriorating economic conditions and reorienting the economy from one that is centrally&#13;
planned to a free market economy. Outward orientation has been the development strategy and,&#13;
to this end, a number of reform packages were undertaken and continue to operate.&#13;
    Since 1992, under the support and guidance of the International Monetary Fund and the&#13;
World Bank, Ethiopia has undergone liberalization and enhanced structural adjustment pro-&#13;
grams to restrain internal and external imbalances of the economy. One of the basic tasks of the&#13;
new policy regime is to continue opening the economy to foreign competition with a view to&#13;
benefiting from expanded markets.&#13;
    The aim of the external sector policy reform was to diversify the country's export base to&#13;
ease foreign currency shortages along a free market-based economic path. To achieve this objec-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
tive, the government not only has minimized its role in the external sector but also has ensured ad-&#13;
equate private capital participation in the export business. The tools implemented include deval-&#13;
uation of the birr and a step-by-step liberalization of the foreign exchange market, streamlining&#13;
the import and export licensing system, reducing tariffs and offering fiscal incentives to exporters,&#13;
abolishing taxes on exports and subsidies to parastatal exporting enterprises, encouraging export-&#13;
oriented investment, introducing duty drawback and foreign exchange retention schemes, and&#13;
minimizing administrative and bureaucratic procedures.&#13;
   The government also has promulgated an export development strategy and established ex-&#13;
port support institutions. It has implemented export-specific incentive schemes aimed at diver-&#13;
sifying the country's export products by changing the structure of the subsector in particular&#13;
and the whole economy in general (Ministry of Trade and Industry 1998). A brief review of these&#13;
measures is presented here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   THE EXPORT DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. The major objectives of the export development strategy&#13;
are sustaining the growth of agricultural production, generating foreign exchange, and promot-&#13;
ing internationally competitive industry. The document has recognized the complexity of shun-&#13;
ning heavy reliance on agricultural products within a short period of time and has underlined&#13;
the strategic importance of giving due concern to the export of coffee, cotton, fruits and vegeta-&#13;
bles, and livestock and livestock products, partly because these products have wider and stable&#13;
foreign markets. Because a sustainable market for primary products calls for their supply in&#13;
manufactured form, the strategy document emphasized textile, leather, meat, and other agroin-&#13;
dustries with greater employment-generating potential and easy entry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   EXPORT SUPPORT INSTITUTIONS. The government has recognized the importance of establishing&#13;
appropriate export promotion services and the institutions to provide them. The first step taken&#13;
was to establish the Ethiopian Export Promotion Agency, aimed at the design and coordination&#13;
of the overall export promotion effort and at proper and most efficient use of existing capacity.&#13;
The agency was created to provide comprehensive support services and incentives to exporters,&#13;
including timely market information, priority in receipt of credit, working premises, and ware-&#13;
houses. The Ethiopian Trade Point, set up under the agency, is a source of trade-related informa-&#13;
tion on businesses and market opportunities, potential clients and suppliers, and trade regula-&#13;
tions and requirements.&#13;
   The Animal Products Marketing Agency was established to work on developing the live-&#13;
stock sector. The Leather and Leather Products Technology Institute was put in place to promote&#13;
the production and export of the leather industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   EXPORT INCENTIVE SCHEMES. The following export incentive schemes were introduced with a&#13;
view to encouraging domestic exporters to compete in an increasingly competitive world market:&#13;
&#13;
   · Foreign Exchange Retention Scheme: Under this plan, eligible exporters of goods and serv-&#13;
       ices and recipients of inward remittances are allowed to benefit from the foreign ex-&#13;
       change retention facility. The foreign exchange surrender requirement was eliminated&#13;
       and replaced by a conversion requirement permitting the use of foreign exchange pro-&#13;
       ceeds for current account transactions within four weeks. Exporters are able to sell their&#13;
       foreign exchange receipts (90 percent of total proceeds) to any bank or Forex bureau at&#13;
       freely negotiated rates over the conversion period, holding the 10 percent in Retention&#13;
       Account A indefinitely. They are allowed to deposit the remaining 90 percent in Retention&#13;
       Account B for a maximum of 28 days; after that, commercial banks are obliged to convert&#13;
       the balance in Retention Account B for their own account and pay the birr equivalent to&#13;
       the customer, using the applicable interbank rate for the day. The balances in Retention&#13;
       Accounts A and B can be used for import of goods and services, export promotion, pay-&#13;
       ment of advertising and marketing expenses, subscription to business publications, train-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                Kagnew Wolde   129&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  ing and educational expenses, settlement of external loans, and payments of supplies&#13;
  credits (see National Bank of Ethiopia [1998] for details).&#13;
· Export Trade Duty Incentive Schemes: The following plans were put in place to support the&#13;
  export sector:&#13;
&#13;
     °   Duty Drawback Scheme: This program is made operational on a deferred payment&#13;
         basis, allowing exporters to import inputs at world prices up front. Exporters&#13;
         would be refunded 100 percent of the duty, including indirect taxes, paid on raw&#13;
         materials used in the production of commodities upon exportation of the com-&#13;
         modities processed. If the imported raw material is re-exported in the same condi-&#13;
         tion because it does not conform to purchase order specification, is damaged, is a&#13;
         short delivery, or is not in market demand, the refund will be 95 percent (Procla-&#13;
         mation No. 249/2001). Implementation of this plan is not efficient enough, howev-&#13;
         er, and there is need for further improvement and simplification of its operation&#13;
         along with the exemption schemes.&#13;
     °   Voucher Scheme: A voucher is a document with monetary value written by the Min-&#13;
         istry of Finance and Economic Development for use as a deposit for duties and tax-&#13;
         es payable on imported raw materials. Under this scheme, vouchers are issued by&#13;
         the Customs Authority to exporters who have manufacturing licenses and who ful-&#13;
         fill the stipulated eligibility criteria. The vouchers are in the amount of taxes and du-&#13;
         ties to be paid on raw materials imported for the production of exportable products.&#13;
     °   Bonded Manufacturing Warehouse Scheme: This is a duty-free importation plan that&#13;
         benefits exporters who are not eligible to use the voucher program. Exporters hav-&#13;
         ing a manufacturing license and insured warehouses that fully comply with all&#13;
         customs laws and regulations are allowed to import the required raw materials&#13;
         free of duties for use in the production of manufactured exports.&#13;
&#13;
· Export Credit Guarantee Scheme: The concept of "export credit guarantee" was defined in&#13;
  Article 1 of the directive as a guarantee provided by the National Bank of Ethiopia to&#13;
  safeguard export financing banks against losses resulting from the export transactions&#13;
  they finance. This credit is issued for a specific period of time that does not exceed 180&#13;
  days. The objective of the export guarantee scheme is to support the export sector by pro-&#13;
  viding the necessary vehicles to help exporters with bona fide export orders access bank&#13;
  credit. It covers all noncoffee export products. The National Bank of Ethiopia issues pre-&#13;
  or postshipment export credit guarantees to cover 80 percent of the risk that may result&#13;
  from repayment default, and the financing bank covers the remaining portion of the risk.&#13;
  The credit guarantee issued by the National Bank of Ethiopia upon written request of the&#13;
  financing bank serves as part of the collateral when applying to a financing bank for pre-&#13;
  or postshipment finance. The interest rate export credit is the prevailing lending rate in&#13;
  each financing bank (see National Bank of Ethiopia 2002).&#13;
· External Loan and Suppliers' or Foreign Partners' Credit: Investment Proclamation No.&#13;
  37/1996 enabled domestic investors in Ethiopia to acquire external loans; to encourage&#13;
  exporters engaged in production to meet expenses, the National Bank of Ethiopia (2002a)&#13;
  issued a Directive for the Registration of External Loan and Suppliers' or Foreign Part-&#13;
  ners' Credit in 2002. Per Article 1 of the directive, external loans include short-, medium-,&#13;
  and long-term loans obtained from external creditors; suppliers' or foreign partners'&#13;
  credit (usually but not always short-term) is an interim financing provided by a supplier&#13;
  or foreign partner. Recipients of external loans and suppliers' or foreign partners' credit&#13;
  should be registered with the National Bank of Ethiopia. No remittances may leave&#13;
  Ethiopia in convertible currency for the purpose of paying external loans and suppliers'&#13;
  or foreign partners' credit unless recipients have been registered with the bank. The reg-&#13;
  istration for an external loan obtained by an investor is made only after it is clear that the&#13;
  acquired loan will finance an export-oriented investment that generates foreign ex-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
130    Export Performance and Economic Growth in Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        change. Registration for suppliers' or foreign partners' credit is made only when it is clear&#13;
        that the credit will finance the importation of capital goods, raw materials, semifinished&#13;
        goods, spare parts, and other inputs to be used in the production and transportation of&#13;
        exportable products.&#13;
&#13;
    In sum, the attempts made to enhance exports, particularly nontraditional exports, have not&#13;
produced the anticipated results. Ethiopia's success in diversifying its exports into high-value&#13;
products has been limited, many scholars argue, because different governments have tried to in-&#13;
crease the volume of production of the same traditional agricultural commodities, as if the&#13;
country had a comparative advantage in those commodities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data and Methodology&#13;
&#13;
Data Types and Sources&#13;
&#13;
The main sources of data for this study were the National Bank of Ethiopia's bulletins, informa-&#13;
tion from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, and the Ethiopian Economic As-&#13;
sociation's statistical database.&#13;
    Because adequate and reliable quarterly data were not available, annual data were used to&#13;
examine the link between real export growth (defined as the changes in the log of real exports)&#13;
and the real economic growth rate (defined as the changes in the log of real GDP). The ideal&#13;
macroeconomic data available to undertake time-series studies in Ethiopia are from 1960 on-&#13;
ward. Even the available data lack accuracy.&#13;
    Total population is taken as a proxy for labor force, although the use of population in an em-&#13;
pirical study may overestimate the contribution of labor to the rate of economic growth.&#13;
    It is inherently difficult to measure the stock of physical capital because constructing a capi-&#13;
tal stock series calls for two basic data sets of information--the initial base year for the capital&#13;
stock and the rate of depreciation--and these are not available. Hence, gross domestic invest-&#13;
ment or gross fixed capital formation could be used as a proxy for capital. Researchers engaged&#13;
in testing the export-led growth hypothesis have followed this strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Framework of the Analysis&#13;
&#13;
The new growth theory has resulted in some revision of the determinants of growth in model-&#13;
ing the function of exports in the growth process. This new development has added to the liter-&#13;
ature on the export-growth nexus. According to this endogenous growth theory, research that&#13;
has failed to consider the endogenous nature of growth processes is subject to simultaneity bias&#13;
and yields erratic conclusions.&#13;
    As indicated in recent empirical literature, excluding relevant variables from the analysis&#13;
may understate or overstate the causality between variables (Al-Yousif 1999; Keong, Yusop, and&#13;
Liew 2003; Medina-Smith 2001).&#13;
    Accordingly, the following production function is adopted:&#13;
&#13;
                                                 Qt = f(Lt,Kt,Xt),                              (6.1)&#13;
&#13;
where Q denotes real GDP; K and L denote physical and human capital, respectively; and X rep-&#13;
resents real exports.&#13;
    This study used multivariate cointegration and error correction procedure, hypothesizing&#13;
GDP as a function of aggregate exports, imports, capital, labor force, and exchange rate:&#13;
&#13;
                                                    +    ­  +     + +&#13;
                                       GDPt = f Xt, Mt, GCFt, Lt, ERt ,                         (6.2)&#13;
&#13;
where GDPt = real GDP, Mt = real imports, Xt = real exports, GCFt = real gross capital formation&#13;
(as a proxy for capital), LABt = labor force (as measured by total population), and ERt = real ex-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                 Kagnew Wolde     131&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
change rate (as measured by Br/US$). Signs above the variables suggest the anticipated rela-&#13;
tionship between explanatory variables, with the dependent variable proposed a priori on the&#13;
basis of economic theory.&#13;
    A positive link is expected between economic growth and export expansion. Export growth&#13;
has a pivotal role in improving productivity growth. According to Balassa (1985), the produc-&#13;
tion of export goods is concentrated on more efficient sectors of the economy. Therefore, export&#13;
expansion makes it possible to concentrate investment in these sectors, which in turn raise the&#13;
total productivity of the economy. Lancaster (1980) and Krugman (1984) validated unidirection-&#13;
al causality from output to exports and argued that output growth positively affects productiv-&#13;
ity growth, whereas cost reduction in labor and capital is expected to promote exports. It is thus&#13;
reasonable to expect export growth to have a causal relationship with output growth.&#13;
    The importance of human capital accumulation received due attention in the new growth&#13;
theory. In particular, it is expected to foster labor productivity and hence growth.&#13;
    Imports may relate negatively or positively to economic growth, depending on the nature of&#13;
imported goods. As Riezman, Whiteman, and Summers (1996) have shown, imports play a vital&#13;
role in the export-led growth relationship in many of the countries considered in their analysis.&#13;
Because the export externality effects may be the result of the role of exports in easing foreign&#13;
borrowing constraints, the impact of imports is expected to be significant in the analysis. Con-&#13;
trarily, a rise in imports may reduce the country's international reserves, thereby slowing down&#13;
the economic growth.&#13;
    Price instability and political intervention also may impact the relationship between output&#13;
and export growth. The neoclassical growth theory hypothesized that export performance in&#13;
developing countries depends on the price of goods and consumer income. That is why the&#13;
model incorporates the exchange rate. Exchange rate mirrors the price competitiveness in the&#13;
international market and affects economic performance through export channels (Al-Yousif&#13;
1999), and it could serve as a mechanism for adjusting the effects of changes in world prices. Ac-&#13;
cordingly, the study hypothesizes a positive correlation between the exchange rate and eco-&#13;
nomic growth. Economic theory suggests that depreciation of the domestic currency raises the&#13;
competitiveness of the domestic commodities, and hence, boosts exports.&#13;
    Real output and investment appear to be positively correlated. Because saving is insufficient&#13;
to support domestic investment requirements, the import of capital is a must. Imports can be fi-&#13;
nanced through exports and borrowing from the rest of the world. Thus, investment is relatable&#13;
to import. Patterson (2004) found a positive link between investment and GDP growth rates in&#13;
Ethiopia. The results also suggested that financing investment from exports and capital inflow&#13;
is a viable way to promote growth--that is, exports influence economic growth through their ef-&#13;
fects on investment.&#13;
    Introducing logarithm to the variables in equation (6.2) yields&#13;
&#13;
                LRGDPt = a0 + b1LLt + b2LRGCFt + b3LRERt + b4RLMt + b5RLXt = Ut,                (6.3)&#13;
&#13;
where LRGDPt, LLt, LRGCFt, LRERt, LRMt, and LRXt are the logs of output, labor, gross capital&#13;
formation, exchange rate, and export variables, respectively. The coefficients a1, . . . , b5 are pa-&#13;
rameters, and Ut is the random disturbance term. Equation (6.3) forms the basis of estimations&#13;
in this study.&#13;
    Recent empirical studies used the concept of causality to test the relationship between ex-&#13;
ports and growth. According to the Granger (1969, 1988) causality approach, a variable, Y, is&#13;
caused by X if Y can be predicted better from past values of Y and X than from past values of Y&#13;
alone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    TESTS FOR ORDER OF INTEGRATION. The primary step in time-series regression is testing&#13;
whether variables share a common trend or each series contains a stochastic trend in such a way&#13;
that they can be considered to have a long-run equilibrium relationship. This is a test of whether&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
132   Export Performance and Economic Growth in Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a series is integrated of order d, termed I (d). The aim is to verify whether the series had a sta-&#13;
tionary trend and, if nonstationary, to establish orders of integration. Estimating regression in&#13;
the presence of nonstationary variables based on OLS regression leads to spurious regression,&#13;
owing to a violation of the classical assumptions about the property of the disturbance term (En-&#13;
ders 1995; Rao 1995). It is also difficult to conduct hypothesis testing in nonstationary variables&#13;
because the classical assumptions on the property of the disturbance term (that is, zero mean,&#13;
constant variance, and is autocorrelated) are violated (Rao 1995). The residuals from such a re-&#13;
gression will have variance increasing overtime, violating the properties of least squares esti-&#13;
mators. One could achieve stationarity by applying appropriate differencing (called order of in-&#13;
tegration), which is referred to as the number of times a series must be differenced before it&#13;
becomes stationary. Macroeconomic data often are integrated in their level form and stationary&#13;
after differencing.&#13;
   The second step in time-series regression is to find whether the variables share a common&#13;
stochastic trend--that is, to test whether two or more variables are cointegrated.&#13;
   A causality test holds for only stationary variables and all time-series in the cointegrating&#13;
equation have the same order of integration. The study first will ascertain the series properties&#13;
of the variables to avoid spurious regression by performing unit root tests on all the variables&#13;
involved.&#13;
   The augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF; Dickey and Fuller 1981) is used to check stationari-&#13;
ty of the variables (denoted as I[0]). In cases where the series are nonstationary about their&#13;
mean, the traditional suggestion is to differentiate the series, which leads to stationarity that&#13;
permits the researcher to apply conventional econometrics. However, first differencing is not an&#13;
appropriate solution to this problem because it prevents detection of the long-run relationship&#13;
that may be present in the data--that is, the long-run information may be lost. The approach fol-&#13;
lowed to improve this problem is testing for cointegration and error correction models for&#13;
causality.&#13;
   The standard Dickey-Fuller test is conducted by estimating the following regression equation:&#13;
&#13;
                                         DYt=a+bt+dYt +Ut,                                    (6.4)&#13;
                                                              ­1&#13;
&#13;
where D is the differencing operator, Yt represents the variables to be estimated (LRGDPt, LLt,&#13;
LRGCFt, LRERt, LRMt, LRXt), a is constant, b is the trend coefficient, U is the white noise resid-&#13;
ual of zero mean and constant variance, and t is the time or trend variable. The null and alterna-&#13;
tive hypotheses are&#13;
&#13;
                                                    H0 : d = 0                                (6.5)&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Ha : d &lt; 0                                (6.6)&#13;
&#13;
   Accepting the null hypothesis implies that there is a unit root, whereas rejecting it implies&#13;
that the time-series (Yt) is stationary. The null hypothesis is then evaluated using the conven-&#13;
tional t-ratio for d. This is not without a weakness because it assumes an independently and&#13;
identically distributed random variable error term with zero mean and constant variance. If the&#13;
assumption of constant variance and zero mean fails, the limiting distribution and critical val-&#13;
ues obtained by the simple Dickey-Fuller unit root cannot hold. According to Rao (1995), this&#13;
problem could be avoided by running the ADF test, which constructs a parametric correction&#13;
for higher-order correlation by assuming the Y series follows an AR(m) process and adding m&#13;
lagged difference terms of the dependent variable Y to the right-hand side of the test regression.&#13;
   The ADF test is thus derived from the regression equation:&#13;
&#13;

   The null hypothesis is rejected if d is negative and statistically significant. The null hypothe-&#13;
sis of a unit root is rejected if the t-statistic associated with the estimated coefficient d exceeds&#13;
the critical values of the test.&#13;
   The ADF specification accounts for possible autocorrelation in the error process Ut through&#13;
the lagged dependent variable on the right-hand side. The practical rule for establishing the val-&#13;
ue of m (that is, the number of lags) is that it should be large enough to ensure that the residual&#13;
is empirically white noise. An augmentation of one or two lags appears to be sufficient to re-&#13;
move autocorrelation in the error terms. The weakness in this test is that the power of the test&#13;
may be adversely affected by misstating the lag length (Rao 1995).&#13;

   TESTS FOR COINTEGRATION. Engle and Granger (1987) introduced the concept of cointegration&#13;
in which economic variables may reach a long-run equilibrium that depicts a stable relation-&#13;
ship. They argued that, despite being individually nonstationary, a linear combination of two or&#13;
more time-series variables can be stationary: "If such a stationary linear combination (also&#13;
called cointegrating equation) exists, the nonstationary time-series are said to be cointegrated."&#13;
Cointegration can be regarded as the empirical counterpart of the theoretical notion of a long-&#13;
run or equilibrium relationship among the variables (Rao 1995). For a two-variables case, X and&#13;
Y are said to be cointegrated of order one, I(1), if both are integrated of order one and there ex-&#13;
ists a linear combination of the two variables that is stationary, I(0).&#13;
    Cointegration is particularly useful in modeling series characterized by trends. Trends in&#13;
data often lead to spurious correlations. This suggests that relationships between variables in a&#13;
regression equation, when all that is present, are simply correlated time trends. Standard statis-&#13;
tical tests are not validated in such cases. Cointegration technique provides a means of identify-&#13;
ing and hence avoiding spurious regressions generated by such nonstationary series. When&#13;
variables are cointegrated, the OLS estimates from the cointegrating regression will be super-&#13;
consistent, implying that the estimates approach their true parameters at a faster rate than if the&#13;
variables were stationary and not cointegrated (Gujarati 2003).&#13;
    The cointegration test is used to verify whether groups of nonstationary series are cointe-&#13;
grated, and the presence of a cointegrating relationship forms the basis of the error correction&#13;
specification.&#13;
    To determine the long-run relationship between export growth and economic growth in this&#13;
study, the Johansen (1988, 1991) multivariate cointegration test is used. It involves the following&#13;
steps. First, we determine the order of integration for each of the variables under consideration&#13;
and then estimate cointegrating regression with a vector autoregression model. Finally, if the&#13;
time-series are cointegrated, we construct the error correction model (ECM).&#13;
    The Johansen cointegration test is a systems approach based on estimation of a vector au-&#13;
toregressive model. It accounts for the possibility of more than one cointegrating vector when&#13;
there are more than two variables in a given equation. More than one cointegrating vector im-&#13;
plies that the model should consist of two or more equations.&#13;
    For an intuitive insight into the Johansen method, consider a two-variable case. Suppose that&#13;
two I(1) variables, x and y, are determined by the following autoregressive distributed lag equa-&#13;
tions with a maximum of two periods:&#13;
&#13;
                             Yt = b11Yt + b12Xt + b13Yt + b14Xt + e1t,                           (6.8)&#13;

    In a multivariate case of m variables that are all I(1), there will be m equations similar to (6.8)&#13;
and (6.9). These equations will have a matrix formulation similar to (6.12), except that b1 and b2&#13;
are now both m × m matrices and et now contains m disturbances.&#13;
    In the general case, the rank of b2 is m, at most. If the rank of b2 is zero (that is, all its elements&#13;
are zero), then the m variables are not cointegrated. If the rank of b2 takes the maximum value,&#13;
then all the variables are I(0), so the question of cointegration does not arise. If the m variables in&#13;
equation (6.12) are cointegrated, it means that the m equations are free from spurious regression&#13;
problems. However, standard estimation methods are not applicable, and a maximum likeli-&#13;
hood method should be used. The Johansen procedure not only determines the number of coin-&#13;
tegrating vectors but also provides estimates of these vectors.&#13;
    The first step in this approach is to test the hypothesis that r = 0--that is, there are no cointe-&#13;
grating vectors, where r equals the number of the cointegrating vectors. If the value of the like-&#13;
lihood ratio is greater than the critical values given by the test, the hypothesis r = 0 is rejected in&#13;
favor of r  1. Nonrejection of this hypothesis implies that the variables are not cointegrated and&#13;
the procedure stops. Otherwise, if r = 0 can be rejected, it is possible to test the hypothesis that&#13;
there is, at most, one cointegrating vector (r  1). If this hypothesis is also rejected, then the hy-&#13;
potheses r  2, r  3, . . . may be tested in sequence until a hypothesis cannot be rejected.&#13;
    For the purpose of testing the number of cointegrating vectors, Johansen and Juselius (1990)&#13;
proposed the use of two likelihood ratio test statistics, namely, the trace test and the maximum&#13;
eigenvalues test.&#13;
    The trace statistic for the null hypothesis of r cointegrating relations is computed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                                          m&#13;
                                          ttrace(r)=­Ti log[1­lt],                                    (6.13)&#13;
                                                          =1&#13;
&#13;
where T denotes total number of usable observations, m represents the number of endogenous vari-&#13;
ables, li is the largest eigenvalue obtained from the coefficient matrix, and ttrace (r) is a chi-square dis-&#13;
tribution with m ­ l degrees of freedom. Large values of ttrace (r) give evidence against the hypothe-&#13;
sis of l or fewer cointegration vectors. When all li = 0, ttrace = 0. The farther the estimated eigenvalues&#13;
are from zero, the more negative is log(1­li) and the larger the ttrace statistic (Enders 1995).&#13;
    The maximum eigenvalue statistic test is computed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                       tmax(r,r+1)=­Tlog(1­lr ).                                      (6.14)&#13;
                                                                       +1&#13;
&#13;
In this case, the null hypothesis of r cointegrating vectors is tested against the alternative of r+1&#13;
cointegrating vectors, for r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k­1. According to Johansen and Juselius (1990), the max-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                    Kagnew Wolde     135&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
imum eigenvalue test statistic is more powerful than the trace test. The number of significant&#13;
nonzero eigenvalues determines the number of cointegrating vectors in the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   VECTOR ERROR CORRECTION MODEL. If variables are cointegrated, an error correction model&#13;
exists. The model combines both the short-run dynamics and long-run properties while it&#13;
avoids the "spurious regression" problem. If variables are cointegrated, then a vector error cor-&#13;
rection model (VECM) must be used to examine causality.&#13;
   The VECM often is expressed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                         DZt = a + G1 DZt + . . . . . + Gk DZt­k                                (6.15)&#13;
                                          ­1                    +1+ P Zt­k + Ut,&#13;
&#13;
where P denotes the coefficient matrix. The existence of cointegration between the variables&#13;
suggests the presence of causality between them in at least one direction. The causal relation-&#13;
ship between economic growth and export will be examined, based on ECM in a case where the&#13;
series are cointegrated.&#13;
   Equation (6.15) thus can be expressed in the VECM as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                   DLRGDPt = a0 +ia a1 DLRGDPt­i + ia2 DLRXt +ic a3 DLLt +&#13;

mates obtained from the normalized cointegrating vectors. The speed of adjustment coefficient&#13;
is of particular interest because it has imperative implications for the dynamics of the system.&#13;
The coefficient g measures the long-run equilibrium relationship, while a1, . . . , a6 and b0, . . . , b6&#13;
measure the short-run causal relationship.&#13;

Empirical Results&#13;
&#13;
Tests for Stationarity&#13;
&#13;
As mentioned earlier, the series considered should be stationary and/or cointegrated in order to&#13;
infer a meaningful relationship from the regression. The ADF test was used to arrange the data&#13;
in levels of significance and in first differences to test the stationarity of the variables. The re-&#13;
sults for all the variables are depicted in table 6.2. All variables under investigation are found to&#13;
be nonstationary at levels, suggesting that the estimated values of all variables in levels are not&#13;
statistically different from zero (table 6.2a)--that is, they contain a unit root process and do not&#13;
have the tendency to return to a long-run level. Hence, the series have a stochastic trend (they&#13;
share a common stochastic movement), which indicates that the null hypothesis cannot be re-&#13;
jected for any of the variables under investigation.&#13;
   However, after first differencing the null hypothesis, the variables are stationary at the 1 per-&#13;
cent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels of significance and, hence, are characterized by one order&#13;
of integration I(1) processes. A higher order of differencing is not required because the test&#13;
strongly rejects the unit root at their first difference. The result suggests that GDP depends on&#13;
the change in the level of the variables at their first difference.&#13;

Cointegration and Vector Error Correction Model&#13;
&#13;
Because all of the variables appear to be integrated in an order of one and their first differences&#13;
appear to be stationary, they all are candidates to be included in a long-run relationship. The&#13;
next procedure is to test for cointegration. The idea behind cointegration analysis is that, al-&#13;
though macroeconomic variables may tend to trend up and down over time, groups of variables&#13;
may drift together.&#13;
   The Johansen procedure was followed to detect the number of cointegrating vectors. The re-&#13;
sults show that the variables are cointegrated with a maximum of two cointegrating equations.&#13;
The null hypothesis of no cointegration among the variables (at r = 0 and at r  1) is rejected at&#13;
the 1 percent level of significance (table 6.3).&#13;
   The results thus demonstrate that the considered variables are cointegrated in that there is a&#13;
long-run equilibrium relationship among them (that is, these series cannot move too far away&#13;
from each other or they cannot move independently of each other). The fact that the variables&#13;
are cointegrated implies that there is some adjustment process in the short run, preventing the&#13;
errors in the long-run relationship from becoming larger and larger.&#13;
   The residual generated from the estimation of the long-run output growth model is found to&#13;
be stationary at the 1 percent significance level, suggesting that the variables are cointegrated.&#13;
The long-run model is a static regression because it does not allow dynamic adjustments. A&#13;

general-to-specific modeling technique was used in the estimating process. The estimation re-&#13;
sults (table 6.4) reveal that all the variables have the expected signs, implying that export&#13;
growth, exchange rate, labor, and capital positively affect output growth, and import is found&#13;
negatively related with output.&#13;
    The model was run again, excluding real exchange rate, and the results continued to support&#13;
the hypothesis that export, labor, and capital are positively related with output (results not re-&#13;
ported). However, labor and capital would have significant effects on economic growth in the&#13;
long run. The results suggest the need for enhancing foreign and domestic investments, which&#13;
currently are low, to enhance sustainable development of the economy. Investment in human&#13;
capital is also required because a well-educated and healthy labor force is one of the key deter-&#13;
minants of economic growth and greater integration into the world economy.&#13;
    Real exchange rate measures the price of a country's goods relative to its trading partners'&#13;
prices, expressed in local currency. A real depreciation of the exchange rate enhances the do-&#13;
mestic goods in comparison with goods of foreign countries and so improves the country's&#13;
trade balance, owing to a shift in demand to goods produced locally from those produced&#13;
abroad. Conversely, a real appreciation of the exchange rate weakens the competitiveness of the&#13;
domestic economy. Real exchange rate is positively and significantly related to growth, which&#13;
suggests the need to shift the structure of both production and trade toward products with de-&#13;
mand elasticity and to high-value-added products.&#13;
    Including imports in the system permits us to capture the indirect impact of promoting ex-&#13;
ports in the accumulation of foreign exchange that enables the economy to finance imports of&#13;
capital goods--which in turn enhances economic growth. However, the finding that the esti-&#13;
mated parameter of real import is highly significant but of a negative sign indicates that much&#13;
dependence on imports has negatively affected the growth of the economy. The negative sign of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
138   Export Performance and Economic Growth in Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
real import tells us that the rise in imports slows down economic growth by affecting the coun-&#13;
try's international reserves. It might result from the country having spent enormous amounts of&#13;
foreign exchange to purchase military armaments during the military regime. The negative sign&#13;
also may suggest that the imports of capital goods and intermediate inputs were stumpy. The&#13;
goods imported are composed mainly of medicaments, petroleum products, devices for vehi-&#13;
cles, electronic devices, and other consumption goods.&#13;
    Next, it is necessary to estimate the coefficients of the short-run dynamics that have impor-&#13;
tant policy implications. Accordingly, a VECM was estimated, incorporating the short-run in-&#13;
teractions and the speed of adjustment toward long-run equilibrium. The short-run dynamics of&#13;
the variables in the system are influenced by the deviation from equilibrium.&#13;
    In estimating, the short-run model dummy for drought, war, and government change was&#13;
introduced to capture their effect from the regression analysis. The model was run with and&#13;
without the dummy. The estimated results, inclusive of the dummy, are reported here (t-ratios&#13;
in parentheses):&#13;

&#13;
    Output growth is explained by the rate of growth of capital, labor, export, exchange rate, and&#13;
the error correction mechanism. As coefficients of the short-run dynamics reveal, however, ex-&#13;
port and labor are statistically significant, showing their contribution to the growth of the econ-&#13;
omy in the short-run. Although statistically insignificant, other variables have the expected&#13;
signs. Ethiopia uses labor as the primary input in production and GDP as a measure of output,&#13;
and 85 percent of the population resides in rural areas. It is sensible that the coefficient of labor&#13;
is positive.&#13;
    The result confirms the hypothesis that exports positively and significantly affect the growth&#13;
of the Ethiopian economy. The literature relates dynamic technological spillover with manufac-&#13;
tured exportable products in that income-elastic goods have a larger effect on economic growth&#13;
than do agricultural goods. However, the results obtained in this study lead to skepticism of the&#13;
argument that a positive and significant link between exports and output growth is achieved&#13;
only when the country's export basket is dominated by higher-value-added manufactured ex-&#13;
ports. The results also showed that the export and economic growth link holds in the face of an&#13;
inward-oriented trade strategy. This study does not suggest that Ethiopia should continue ex-&#13;
porting the same traditional agricultural products that have been exported for decades. Rather,&#13;
the study strongly supports diversification of the economy away from low-value-added agri-&#13;
cultural products to manufactures. Diversifying the productive structure is a key strategy to fos-&#13;
ter economic growth.&#13;
    The results of the pairwise Granger causality test at different lag lengths (that is, 2­4) reveal&#13;
that the causation is not strong, thus suggesting that export growth might affect output growth&#13;
through another channel (which could be discovered through additional research). In empirical&#13;
studies of exports and growth, a major problem arises because exports are component parts of&#13;
the increase in output (Sharma and Panagiotidis 2004), and evidence found in support of the&#13;
export-led growth hypothesis could be biased by the built-in correlation between exports and&#13;
GDP. Estimating the model with other specifications not subject to this bias (for example, by si-&#13;
multaneous method) may bring about a better result. There is a need, for instance, to estimate&#13;
the model (which was not attempted in this study) using the shares of exports in GDP and in-&#13;
vestments in GDP as potentially endogenous variables in the system to reconfirm the hypothe-&#13;
sis. No attempt was made to measure the extent to which the export sector is influenced by in-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                   Kagnew Wolde 139&#13;

&#13;
ternal supply factors and external factors. The accuracy and consistency of data might have&#13;
some effect on the validity of the results.&#13;
    The magnitude of the error correction coefficient is found to be ­0.525, implying that, within&#13;
one year, it adjusts about 52.5 percent of the disequilibria--that is, deviation from long-run&#13;
equilibrium is adjusted fairly quickly and 52.5 percent of the disequilibrium is removed each&#13;
year. The negative coefficient of the dummy variable suggests that the prolonged civil war in&#13;
the military regime and the border conflict, the cyclical droughts and famines that hit the coun-&#13;
try, and the change of government bringing in new ideology have negatively affected the&#13;
growth of the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion and Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Much has been written in the literature regarding the role of the export sector in improving eco-&#13;
nomic growth. The purpose of this study was to investigate empirically the nexus of exports&#13;
and output growth in the Ethiopian context, using cointegration and error-correction proce-&#13;
dures covering the period 1960/61 to 2003/04. The study used a multivariate time-series ap-&#13;
proach within a production function framework, considering real figures of GDP, exports, ex-&#13;
change rate, gross capital formation, imports, and population. The inclusion of these other&#13;
variables would prevent the estimates suffering from omitted-variable bias. Consistent with ex-&#13;
pectations, export growth and output growth were positively related, which supports the ex-&#13;
port-led growth hypothesis.&#13;
    Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries on the African continent, despite its massive produc-&#13;
tive land and abundant resources with immense potential for development. The fact that&#13;
Ethiopia, albeit endowed with plenty of natural and water resources, is one of the poorest coun-&#13;
tries seems paradoxical and suggests the need to bring about a green revolution. To this end,&#13;
long- and short-term measures need to focus on developing and using water resources for agri-&#13;
culture, energy, and other purposes. For a country with the largest livestock population in&#13;
Africa, the production of semiprocessed and finished leather products is insufficient and the&#13;
tanning and leather industry runs at partial capacity because the supply of hides and skins is in-&#13;
adequate. The textile industry also runs at partial capacity, although the country has the capaci-&#13;
ty for high-quality and large-volume domestic cotton production and there is a relatively cheap&#13;
labor force. Because of this under-capacity utilization of the textile industry, the country has&#13;
failed to capitalize on the opportunities offered by the U.S. African Growth Opportunities Act.&#13;
The failure of the country to expand its economy and bring about structural transformation that&#13;
would diversify the productive structure in general and the export base in particular is related&#13;
to its inability to adopt coherent strategies and more proactive policies.&#13;
    Despite the focus on export diversification in the country's development plans, the export&#13;
pattern is still dominated by traditional products and relies greatly on coffee while its world&#13;
price is fluctuating. All of that is symptomatic of the lack of economic transformation and an ab-&#13;
sence of structural change in the mode of production. There is concentration both in commodi-&#13;
ty and country of destination for Ethiopian exports. Although the export of cut flowers is in-&#13;
creasing quickly, success in diversifying the export base and exploiting the hitherto untapped&#13;
resources is not to be gainsaid. The country has failed to exploit its comparative advantage of&#13;
geographic proximity to the African market.&#13;
    The export performance is impeded by a multitude of internal and external problems, in-&#13;
cluding feeble infrastructure, lack of physical and skilled human capital, poor export facilitation&#13;
strategy, market vagaries, climatic conditions, and some policies of the advanced economies. All&#13;
these challenges suggest that the country should spare no effort to diversify its exports on a rap-&#13;
id and sustainable basis.&#13;
    We are in the era of globalization wherein the strongly competent economies could reap the&#13;
benefits of global competition and regional integration. Ethiopia has applied for membership in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the WTO, and its accession to the WTO is one of the principal factors for facilitating economic&#13;
growth. To benefit from its accession, the country needs to strengthen its domestic industries&#13;
and increase its export competitiveness. Improving its position in the international economy&#13;
will enable it to benefit from the existing and future opportunities in the global trading system.&#13;
In this regard, the study suggests the ardent need for a concerted effort to improve internal con-&#13;
ditions and bring about structural transformation, notably diversification of the productive&#13;
structure and curtailment of supply side constraints. Building the capacity of existing manufac-&#13;
turing enterprises, improving their efficiency and productivity, and setting up joint ventures&#13;
with established business in other countries to benefit from the transfer of their expertise remain&#13;
crucial actions to be taken in Ethiopia.&#13;
   It is impossible to imagine a vibrant Ethiopian economy without structural transformation.&#13;
In other words, over the long run, Ethiopia should diversify its economy toward higher-value-&#13;
added and income-elastic products, away from primary agricultural products. This is in line&#13;
with the widely accepted view that a country having a higher share of economic sectors with&#13;
high value added is less prone to external shocks, market vagaries, weather conditions, and un-&#13;
just competition policies. The key impediments of the manufacturing industries are structural.&#13;
Thus, the contribution of the sector to growth and transformation of the economy can be at-&#13;
tained only by removing the serious structural barriers that the sector has faced. Rehabilitating&#13;
the domestic manufacturing industries and encouraging both private domestic and foreign in-&#13;
vestments are strategic issues for success that call for the attention of the government, policy&#13;
makers, and other stakeholders.&#13;
   The study also underlines the need to strengthen export capacity and to promote diversifica-&#13;
tion in the export sector to achieve sustainable growth. Export promotion and diversification&#13;
call for a closer look at each sector of the economy. Hence, designing export promotion strate-&#13;
gies, policies, and support services conducive to stimulating competitiveness remain crucial&#13;
steps. Maintaining an export-friendly, effective exchange rate, lowering the tax burden on ex-&#13;
ports and imports of production inputs, granting subsidies to exporters, providing exporters&#13;
with easy access to foreign exchange for the purchase of intermediate items, and granting ex-&#13;
porters preferential and/or lower interest rates on bank loans are some of the mechanisms this&#13;
study suggests to encourage domestic exports capable of competing in the world market.&#13;
Ethiopia needs to foster competitiveness so that the export sector's capacity to make profits is&#13;
increased and domestic consumption is reduced. Furthermore, the concerned ministry bureau&#13;
needs to intensify its efforts to identify the specific key commodities in which Ethiopia has a&#13;
comparative advantage and may diversify (for instance, expanding the output of horticultural&#13;
and flower products, fruits and vegetables, and livestock products; exploiting apicultural possi-&#13;
bilities). On one hand, doing so could generate employment and income and could stimulate&#13;
growth; on the other hand, it could produce duty-free access to important markets. To become&#13;
competitive in the leather industry, as many scholars argue, there is a need to educate the rural&#13;
population about how to take better care of skins and hides so that the quality of raw materials&#13;
supplied to tanners is improved and production capacity can be enhanced, to provide veteri-&#13;
nary services in rural areas so that diseases can be treated before they cause extensive damage to&#13;
hides and skins, to establish more slaughter houses to lessen damages owing to traditional&#13;
slaughtering methods, and to use the rich experience of partner countries to find solutions to&#13;
the problems encountered by the local tanners and leather commodities manufacturers.&#13;
   Intensifying agricultural production and effectively using agricultural research, water har-&#13;
vesting, and small-scale irrigation for increased yield and production are strategies of para-&#13;
mount importance in boosting exports and reaching a sustainable growth trajectory.&#13;
   Ensuring export diversification also demands identifying key supply constraints that handi-&#13;
cap the sector's performance and taking appropriate measures to improve domestic conditions for&#13;
business development. Particular emphasis should be given to improving problems in infrastruc-&#13;
ture, such as roads, air transport, railways and ports, water and energy supply, rural electrification&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                        Kagnew Wolde 141&#13;

&#13;
and telecommunication services, and other facilities. Enhancing infrastructure would contribute&#13;
greatly to facilitating export diversification and effectively competing in the international market.&#13;
Poor infrastructure is one of the stumbling blocks for attracting foreign investment.&#13;
   Successfully diversifying exports is a means of extricating the country from its excessive de-&#13;
pendence on an inflow of foreign loans and aid and of eradicating its abysmal poverty. The gov-&#13;
ernment needs to work with the business community to establish an atmosphere of mutual trust&#13;
and confidence and to persuade its members to engage in export diversification policy making.&#13;
   Due attention also should be given to exploiting abundant mineral resources, the export of&#13;
which would be a good source of foreign exchange. Preliminary explorations have suggested&#13;
that gold, platinum, phosphate, petroleum, and metallic and chemical minerals are available in&#13;
great quantities. To benefit from the global trading system and maintain rapid economic&#13;
growth, Ethiopia needs to expand the extracting and exporting of mineral resources. The study&#13;
suggests the need to develop new policies and strategies to encourage investments in these un-&#13;
tapped resources.&#13;
   As repeatedly argued in this study and elsewhere, success in bringing about economic trans-&#13;
formation, increasing production, diversifying exports, and ultimately breaking the crippling&#13;
grip of underdevelopment relies on addressing the problems of governance; avoiding bureau-&#13;
cratic red tape; creating enabling supervisory, regulatory, and legal environments; and increas-&#13;
ing private investment, particularly in the productive sectors.&#13;
   The results obtained from the regression indicate that labor affects output growth positively&#13;
and significantly, both in the short run and over the long term. Economic theory asserts that the&#13;
rise in productivity results from changes in knowledge as people learn through experience to&#13;
accomplish familiar tasks better. Global trade competitiveness demands unreserved effort in ed-&#13;
ucating the people and improving their health. In this regard, Ethiopia needs to develop in its&#13;
active labor force the skills required to improve productivity. Although the enrollment rate has&#13;
been improving, due attention should be given to control the quality of education and ensure&#13;
that educational institutions are delivering the required skills. The use of indigenous knowledge&#13;
also may help exploit the potential resources to accelerate economic growth.&#13;
