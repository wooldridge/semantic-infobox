                                                          1949 at 10:00 a.m.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         CHAIRMAN:               We would like to have the approval of minutes of the 196th regUlar meeting.&#13;
         (Black)&#13;
                                 Have the Directors any objections?      If not, the minutes are adopted.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Mr. Iliff, will you report on the present situation on loan negotiations.&#13;
         ILm':                   As well as reporting on the loan negotiations situation, I sha.il go briefly&#13;
&#13;
                                  over our relations with other countries with whom we have not actually&#13;
&#13;
                                  entered into negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
                                  First, with regard to TURKEY, the three technicians, whom we sent to Turkey&#13;
&#13;
                                  to study the three projects that we thought might be the object of Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                  lending, have completed their work and left Turkey.     Mr. Mason, the Loan&#13;
&#13;
                                  Department representative, will remain there for the time being to assist&#13;
&#13;
                                  Mr. Barker who, the Board will remember, has been sent out at the request&#13;
&#13;
                                  of the Turkish Government to investigate the possibility of forming a&#13;
&#13;
                                  general development mission to be sent to Turkey to advise the Turkish&#13;
&#13;
                                  Government on general over-all development problems.     Mr. Barker left for&#13;
                                  Turkey on November 7.      The costs of this Barker mission will be met on the&#13;
&#13;
                                  same basis as the costs of a similar mission wh ich we recently sent to&#13;
&#13;
                                  Colombia, i.e., the Turkish Government will pay all local costs, the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                                  will pay transportation costs outside of Turkey and meet.salaries of&#13;
&#13;
                                  permanent members of the Bank staff; the salary costs of non-Bank personnel&#13;
&#13;
                                  will be split   50-SO   between the Bank ani the Turkish Government.&#13;
&#13;
                                  The Board. will also remember that we sent, at the request of the Turkish&#13;
&#13;
                                  Government, Mr. Harold Johnson to study the best ways of stimulating private&#13;
&#13;
                                  capital investment in Turkey.      Mr. Johnson has been discussing the whole&#13;
&#13;
                                  situation with businessmen arid bankers in Turkey and has now formulated a&#13;
&#13;
                                  plan which has been passed to us in its preliminary form, and we have informed&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            2â&#128;¢&#13;
. .&#13;
 '&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     .LIFF:        him that, while reserving the Bank's position completely, it would be&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
                   appropriate to discuss this preliminarily with the Turkish (]overnment and&#13;
&#13;
                   let us have the Government's reactions.&#13;
&#13;
                   I also want to mention that the President has been holding informal&#13;
&#13;
                   discussions with E.C.A. concerning the extent to which E.C.A. aid to Turkey&#13;
&#13;
                   will be on a loan basis, and the possible effects upon Turkey's credit-&#13;
&#13;
                   worthiness and the Bank's operations in Turkey of the nature of E.C.A.&#13;
&#13;
                   aid which is extended.&#13;
&#13;
                   I would like to make a brief reference to the YUGOSLAV situation.      The&#13;
&#13;
                   treh nical reports of three of the technical specialists have now been&#13;
&#13;
                   presented to the Bank.   A fourth is still awaited.    These reports are&#13;
&#13;
                   under study and we are not yet in position to present    a~   recommendations&#13;
&#13;
                   to the President.&#13;
&#13;
     tIOPPENar :   Which report is still awaited?&#13;
     ILIFF:        The report by the general engineering consultant.&#13;
&#13;
                   With regard to the TIMBER LOANS, that is, $2,300,000 to Finland and&#13;
&#13;
                   $2,700,000 to Yugoslavia, work with regard to the conclusion of the payments&#13;
&#13;
                   Agreements is going on satisfactorily.     The payments Agreement between&#13;
&#13;
                   Finland and the United Kingdom has already been concluded.      We understand&#13;
&#13;
                   that the Agreement between Yugoslavia and France was probably signed&#13;
&#13;
                   yesterday, and that the Agreement between Yugoslavia and Italy would&#13;
&#13;
                   probably be signed about November 1.5.    The discussions are actively ur:rler&#13;
&#13;
                   way with regard to the other Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
                   THE UNITED KINGDOM COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.      We have now reached&#13;
&#13;
                   agreement with the Colonial Development Corporation negotiators, who were&#13;
&#13;
                   in Washington recently, and they have now returned to London.      We hope&#13;
&#13;
                   that we shall be able to place the President in the position of presenting&#13;
&#13;
                   some proposals to the Board, either late this month or early in December.&#13;
&#13;
                   The amount of the proposed loan \'I.rill be $.5 million and the term will be&#13;
&amp;#12;Â·   "&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
- -L1IFF:   either 10 or 12 years.   The Colonial Development Corporation have asked to&#13;
 (Cont1d)&#13;
            be allowed to reserve the point about term until they have had a further&#13;
&#13;
            opportunity to discuss matters with their principals in London.&#13;
&#13;
            The purpose of the loan which we have discussed is to assist the Colonial&#13;
&#13;
            Development Corporation in getting equipment needed in connection with&#13;
&#13;
            undertakings which they may put into operation in various parts of the&#13;
&#13;
            British colonial empire during the next 18 months.    A good deal of the&#13;
&#13;
            equipment will be heavy earth-moving and lani-clearing equipment for use&#13;
&#13;
            in an equipment pool.    Some will, consist of permanent installations in&#13;
&#13;
            various C.D.C. undertakings.    The Corporation have told us that it would&#13;
&#13;
            be their intention, late in 1950, to ask the Bank to consider a second&#13;
&#13;
            loan for about the same amount for equipment needed in late 1951 and 1952.&#13;
&#13;
            CHILE - We have had before us for some time a number of projects submitted&#13;
&#13;
            to us by the Chilean authorities for possible Bank financing, and we have&#13;
&#13;
            felt that the time had probably arrived when we ought to take another look&#13;
&#13;
            at the general economic and financial situation in Chile.    Accordingly,&#13;
&#13;
            Yr. Anderson of the Loan Department and Mr. Franco of the Legal Department&#13;
&#13;
            will go to Chile to make this study. With them Will go Mr. Gerald Alter,&#13;
            who has been put at our disposal by the Federal Reserve Board, and he&#13;
&#13;
            will be adviser on fiscal budgetary ani banking operations and practices,&#13;
            as well as a general economic consultant to the mission.&#13;
&#13;
            The Bank has been asked to send representatives to the Second Meeting of&#13;
&#13;
            Experts of the Central Banks of the Americas which is to take place in&#13;
&#13;
            Santiago on December 2 â&#128;¢. Messrs. Rist, Luxford and Anderson will represent&#13;
&#13;
            the Bank at these meetings.&#13;
&#13;
            COLOlffiIA - The mission headed by Dr. Lauchlin Currie has completed its&#13;
&#13;
            survey and its members are on their way back to Washington to submit their&#13;
&#13;
            reports.   Vie have still been continuing to work in the Bank on an examination&#13;
&#13;
            of the three hydroelectric projects which I have already mentioned to the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          h.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â· ILIFF:      The latest news from Colombia is causing us some concern.     As members of&#13;
 (Cont1d)&#13;
              the Board will know, there is a state of serious political unrest and&#13;
&#13;
              the newspapers indicate that the Colombian Government has been obliged to&#13;
&#13;
              declare a state of siege.   That situation, if it continues, may, I feel,&#13;
&#13;
              to some extent influence the thinking of the Bank as to the possibility&#13;
              of further investment there until the situation has cleared up.&#13;
&#13;
              Mr. Consolo of the Loan Department is now in Central America where he is&#13;
&#13;
              visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua.     The only specific project&#13;
&#13;
              which has been brought to our notice in a state where it is more or less&#13;
&#13;
              ready for examination by the Bank is an agricultural development plan&#13;
&#13;
              submitted to us in September by the Costa Rican Government.     The total&#13;
&#13;
              cost of the plan is approximately $19 million, and it is primarily&#13;
&#13;
              concerned with the expansion of coffee production in Costa Rica.&#13;
&#13;
              We have asked Mr. Consolo to take the opportunity of his presence in&#13;
&#13;
              Central America to discuss the details of this plan with the Costa Rican&#13;
&#13;
              Government.&#13;
  HOPPENar:   The whole cost?&#13;
  ILIFF:      The foreign exchange cost will be less than half.     The bulk of the cost&#13;
              would be local currency.&#13;
&#13;
              SALVADOR - When the Salvadorean negotiators were in Washington in September,&#13;
              we were able to reach complete agreement with them about the details of&#13;
              the Loan and Guarantee Agreements that we might submit to the Board, i.e.,&#13;
&#13;
              $12.5 million for the Rio Lempa Project.      The Agreements were taken back&#13;
&#13;
              by the Salvadoreans to San Salvador ani the Government had decided that,&#13;
&#13;
              in order to disarm any possible criticism and to be assured of full support&#13;
&#13;
              for the substantial commitment, to set   u~   an ad hoc committee of public&#13;
&#13;
              officials and business men to review the agreements.      It is expected that&#13;
&#13;
              the work of this committee will take another two weeks to complete.      Mr.&#13;
              Consolo will look in at San Salvador while he is in Central America and&#13;
&amp;#12; ILIFF:    he will be joined there by Mr. Cancio of the Legal Department, who will&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
           be in position to discuss with the Salvadorean authorities any philosophic&#13;
&#13;
           doubts they have been holding about the legal aspects of these two&#13;
&#13;
           contracts.&#13;
&#13;
           MEXICO - The week before last, Mr. Buchanan of the Loan Department and&#13;
           myself went to Mexico City.   The purpose of our visit was twofold.   Vie&#13;
&#13;
           had for sometime been viewing with some concern the possibility that the&#13;
&#13;
           project promoted by the Federal Electrical Commission which the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
           financing, might be seriously delayed for lack of local currency.     The&#13;
&#13;
           actual local currency needs of tllis project on its present schedule of&#13;
&#13;
           construction amount, during 1950, to approximately 150 million pesos.&#13;
           Just before Mr. Buchanan and I went down, we had been informed that the&#13;
&#13;
           maximum amount which the Mexican Government could undertake to provide was&#13;
&#13;
           50 million, leaving a deficit of 100 million for 1950.   We were informed&#13;
&#13;
           however, that the Mexican authorities proposed to raise 100 million pesos&#13;
&#13;
           by internal oorrowing.   We had some doubts about the possibilities of&#13;
&#13;
           internal borrowing on that scale in Mexico, and when we got to Mexico City&#13;
&#13;
           and discussed the situation with Mr. Beteta, our'doubts were confirmed.     He&#13;
&#13;
           told us that he could only raise 100 million by a so-called public borrowing&#13;
&#13;
           if he oought his own oonds.   He was most reluctant to do so; as he was in&#13;
&#13;
           accord with the position taken by the Bank in earlier discussions, and also&#13;
&#13;
           by the Fund, that the first requirements of the economic situation in&#13;
&#13;
           Mexico was abandonment of deficit financing.   Mr. Beteta went on to say&#13;
&#13;
           that he felt that i f he made any contribution to his country, it was this -&#13;
&#13;
           that for the first time in Mexican history, he had balanced the budget, and&#13;
&#13;
           he intended to keep it balanced.   He could only do that by maintaining&#13;
&#13;
           expenditures at a figure not higher than in 1949, because he was not able&#13;
&#13;
           to introduce any increase in taxes.   The amount which he put at the disposal&#13;
&#13;
           of the Comcission for the local currency costs of the project in 1949 was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 J.LJFF :   50 million pesos, and he felt that that was all he could do during 1950.&#13;
(Cont Id)&#13;
            We pointed out to him that this was a project to which the Mexican authorities&#13;
&#13;
            were contractually committed, and specifically committed to provide the&#13;
&#13;
            local currency necessary to carry it through according to schedule. We&#13;
&#13;
            said the only alternative was that if local currency was not to be provided,&#13;
&#13;
            there would be a cut-back in the project, and we felt if any cut-back did&#13;
&#13;
            come , it ought to be across. the whole field of the public works program,&#13;
&#13;
            and that the impact ought not to fallon just the one project in which the&#13;
&#13;
            Bank had a large financial stake.     ~   had to leave Mexico and go to Reno -&#13;
&#13;
            on Bank business I might say - ani I intimated to the Mexican authorities&#13;
&#13;
            I was not very happy about the    sit~tion,    and proposed to go to Reno and&#13;
&#13;
            return to Mexico.   When I got back, Mr. Beteta told me     h~   had discussed&#13;
            the matter further with President Aleman, and as a result, he proposed to&#13;
&#13;
            put 100 million pesos at the disposal of the Federal Commission during 1950.&#13;
&#13;
            This extra 50 million he assured me was being made available from the&#13;
&#13;
            budget, and without    a~   increase in the over-all amount of outstanding&#13;
&#13;
            Mexican public debt.    It can therefore only come as a result of a cut-back&#13;
&#13;
            of 50 million in other parts of the public works program of the Mexican&#13;
&#13;
            Government.    That still left a gap of 50 million pesos approximately, and&#13;
            Mr. Beteta told me he proposed to raise that money by contracting a dollar&#13;
&#13;
            loan with private banks in the United states.       He asked me what I thought&#13;
&#13;
            about this proposal.    The legal situation is that if the Federal Power&#13;
            Commission should be the borrower, the consent of the International Bank&#13;
&#13;
            is required.    If any other Mexican Government entity or the Goverrunent&#13;
&#13;
            itself should be the borrower, consultation with the Bank is required&#13;
&#13;
            before such a transaction could be uniertaken, but the Bank has no power&#13;
&#13;
            to veto.   I told him that at first sight, and expressing my own personal&#13;
            view, I disliked the proposal     intense~.    I felt that the amount of external&#13;
&#13;
            debt burden which Mexico was already carrying, was so heavy that it was&#13;
&amp;#12;  .Â£IFF :    difficult in my view to justify contracting e~ernal debt of a substantial&#13;
(Cont td).&#13;
             alOOunt to financing internal' expenditure.      But I was in this dilemma, that&#13;
&#13;
             here was a proposal which had been put up which i f it succeeded, would find&#13;
&#13;
             local currency which'we were pressing'Mr. Beteta to find, and i f I turned&#13;
&#13;
             i t down, I was then going to be faced wi th a situation in which the alter-&#13;
&#13;
             native was to cut-back project.     I reserved the    Bankl~'    position and said&#13;
&#13;
             I would have to report to the President', and would infonn Mexico of the&#13;
&#13;
             Bank's attitude.    Since then, the Director General of the Commis~ion has&#13;
&#13;
             called on me in Washington on his way to New Yqrk, and I told him that at&#13;
&#13;
             this stage, the Bank was not prepared to       express~i     view as to the propriety&#13;
&#13;
             of th is proposal of his.    I said we could only do .so ,after we had .more&#13;
&#13;
             details of what form the operation was going to take, and what its terms&#13;
&#13;
             and conditions were likely to be.      I said.that that, was not to be considered&#13;
&#13;
             as an indication'lhat the Bank in principle. was extending its approval to&#13;
&#13;
             this proposal.     Mr. Paez has gone to New York 'to talk 1;.0 some of the private&#13;
&#13;
             bankers there, and discover whether or not he' can ra~se $6 million, which&#13;
&#13;
             is the amount of the dollar counterpart of 50 million pesos he needs                for&#13;
&#13;
             1950.&#13;
                                     as&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:   Half of the $6 millionJi!: understood it, was to'be used to meet 1950 Ex:port-&#13;
&#13;
             Import Bank maturities and the other half local curr~ncy.             Is that it?&#13;
&#13;
 ILIFF:      Yes.    He could of course use approxilIlately 30    millio~     pesos to buy dollars&#13;
&#13;
             from the Central Bank to meet his 1950        maturi~ies   and turn over the whole&#13;
&#13;
             of the new $6 million for pesos.      But under his, proposed set up, he would&#13;
&#13;
             borroW' 6 million, would use 3~ of that to meet the dollar maturities&#13;
                                                                    "     ,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             during 1950 (thereby saving the peso counterpart) and only remaining $2l&#13;
&#13;
             million would be sold for pesos.      In that way, he would actually touch&#13;
&#13;
             the 50 million pesos that he needed.      "&#13;
&#13;
 BEYEN:      Quite, apart from the very interesting question as to whether Mr. Iliff went&#13;
&#13;
             to Reno for reconstruction or development, I would like to say something&#13;
&#13;
             about the Mexican local currency busiress.         When we started to discuss the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DEYEN:     Mexican loan, we were just in a period when Mexico got into trouble with&#13;
(Cont Cd)&#13;
            its currency.   Both here and in   +~e   Fund, I have been troringto get close&#13;
&#13;
            co-operation on this particular subject, because it seemed obvious to me&#13;
            that from the Fund point of view, in connection with the situation as it&#13;
&#13;
            appeared to be at the moment, there would be strong pressure to cut down&#13;
&#13;
            internal expenditure on investment.       It seems to me that although one might&#13;
&#13;
            assume that the Mexican Government would say - and the Fund agree - that&#13;
&#13;
            this particular project had such high priority that investments should not&#13;
&#13;
            be cut down, that all the same it was necessary to look the problem in the&#13;
&#13;
            face of the views of the Fund on the one hand      ~rrl       the Bank on the other.&#13;
&#13;
            Already at that time, I was surprised at the coyness in the Board of the&#13;
&#13;
            Fund to mention the Bank, and the coyness of the Bank to mention the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
            One did not really want to look          this problem in the face and get some&#13;
&#13;
            understanding with the Mexican Government whether expenditure for this&#13;
&#13;
            investment should be given priority.       We are now in a position where we&#13;
                                                                      I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            must press the Mexicans to provide funds for the expenditure.              I will not&#13;
&#13;
            blame anyone for it, and I urrlerstand the difficulty we are in, but i t is&#13;
&#13;
            an illustration how extremely necessary it is in cases like that to have&#13;
&#13;
            the Bank and the Fund agree on policy.        In other cases we may get in same&#13;
&#13;
            pOSition, the Bank and the Fund pulling different ropes in different             direction~&#13;
&#13;
 HOOKER:    May I ask what the delay would be if they only spent 100 million local&#13;
&#13;
            currency, if that was all that was available.        How much would that delay&#13;
&#13;
            the project - would it be a serious delay or just six months or so?&#13;
 ILIFF:     It is very difficult to give a specific anSWer to that question, Mr. Hooker.&#13;
&#13;
            I have asked our engineerato look into the whole program, and to advise us&#13;
&#13;
            as to how the programÂ· shou1d be cut back, assuming that the Federal&#13;
&#13;
            Commission would have   o~y   100 million instead of 150 million they need.&#13;
&#13;
            The trouble will be not only that the project might be delayed - I think&#13;
&#13;
            possibly twelve months would be the answer I would give to your question,&#13;
&amp;#12;- ,,-LIFF:      but I give it with all reserve - but not only that, and what we are more&#13;
 (Cont Id)&#13;
                concerned about, is the effect on the earning power of the Commission and&#13;
&#13;
                the possible effect of a cut-back in the Commission l s program on the&#13;
&#13;
                program of Mexican Light and Power.       It is all a difficult and complicated&#13;
&#13;
                situation.    We have, however, put Mr. Paez on notice that we wish to&#13;
&#13;
                discuss with him the extent to which, ani the field in which, the Connnission1s&#13;
&#13;
                program could be cut back with the least detriment to the Connnission itself&#13;
&#13;
                or to the Company.&#13;
&#13;
  HOPPENar:     I seem to remember that the amount of withdrawals for our loan has been&#13;
&#13;
                very low up to date.&#13;
&#13;
  ILIFF:        That is so.&#13;
&#13;
  HOPPENar:     Do you remember what part 'I&#13;
&#13;
                As far as my recollection goes, I think five million is the draw-down up to&#13;
&#13;
                now.    However, Mr.   P~ley   is checking that amount.&#13;
&#13;
  HOPPENar:     Are they paying interest on sums they do not use?&#13;
&#13;
  CHAIRMAN:     What was that last question?&#13;
&#13;
  HOPPENOI'I    Are they paying interest on sums they do not use?&#13;
&#13;
   BRESCIANI:   I should like to stress this point.        As far as I understand, there is a&#13;
&#13;
                gap in Mexico of   50   million pesos.    This gap could be filled up in various&#13;
                ways.    The Government could take recourse to inflation, and issue Bank&#13;
&#13;
                notes to the amount of fifty million pesos, but this would upset the&#13;
&#13;
                5&lt;1stem of prices and have serious repercussions on monetary and economic&#13;
                stability, so that this proposal is not taken into account.        Another&#13;
&#13;
                solution, is a foreign loan to the amount of $6 million.        Then these $6&#13;
&#13;
                million are sold by the Mexican Government to the Central Bank, vihich&#13;
&#13;
                issues a corresponding amount of Bank notes. I disregard the fact that&#13;
                                        be&#13;
                part of this loan would/spent outside the United States in order to repay&#13;
&#13;
                the loan granted by the Export-Import Bank.        I suppose that the whole&#13;
&#13;
                amount of dollars is transferred into local currency.        I contend that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         9-A.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI:   the immediate effect on internal prices would be the same as in the case&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
             paper money is issued without any foreign currency cover.    In both cases&#13;
&#13;
             new purchasing power is created, which would influence prices.    Later on,&#13;
&#13;
             of course, when the rise of internal prices provokes an inflow of goods&#13;
&#13;
             from abroad - which can payoff thanks to the foreign exchange provided&#13;
&#13;
             by the loan - inflationary tendencies are stopped.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    I think it might be interesting for Mr. Iliff to tell the Directors about&#13;
&#13;
             this external loan.    We have been told that the Mexicans are hopeful of&#13;
&#13;
             obtaining an external loan running for a period of nine or ten years.&#13;
&#13;
             There have been some discussions in New York.     In my opinion, it would&#13;
&#13;
             be impossible to get this loan in !'lew York unless there is some special&#13;
&#13;
             arrangement made.     Such an arrangement might be that they would obtain&#13;
&#13;
             a loan from a New York bank and, after they had obtained the loan, they&#13;
&#13;
             would then agree to keep the amount of the loan on deposit With the New&#13;
&#13;
             York bank.   That is a pretty unsatisfactory way of doing business.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:    That was practiced many times even by Central Banks in Europe during the&#13;
&#13;
             1930's depression.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Anyway we will wait until we see what specific proposal a New York or&#13;
&#13;
             Chicago bank makes before we decide on that point.   In my opinion" it would&#13;
&#13;
             be impossible to get a straight loan without some unusual    agreement such&#13;
&#13;
             as was described.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:    I should like to refer to what I said before; if the condition is that the&#13;
&#13;
             amount of dollars loaned would be kept as a deposit in New York, that is&#13;
&#13;
             purely an inflationary operation like Professor Bresciani said.    Dollars&#13;
&#13;
             so issued against this loan would be the same dollars issued without&#13;
&#13;
             collateral and the inflationary effect would be 100%.   What I say is that&#13;
&#13;
             in case of an underdeveloped country which wants to develop their resources,&#13;
&#13;
             it is hardly possible to do it without inflation.    The country must have&#13;
&#13;
             that choice, either development or equilibrium. There is probably a&#13;
                                                       the&#13;
             contradiction between the two and that is/kind of problem a country that&#13;
             has to be developed must decide itself.&#13;
HOPPENar:    I hesitate to enter this discussion on a matter which so many people here&#13;
&#13;
             are much more competent than myself but nevertheless I have heard two&#13;
&#13;
             different expressions of thought.    Running a printing press is supposed&#13;
&#13;
             to be 'more inflationary than the process of running the same printing&#13;
             press at the same time increasing the gold or hard currency reserves of&#13;
&#13;
             the Central Bank.   That theory has been very widely brought forward and,&#13;
&#13;
             I must say, accepted by highly placed financial authorities.    I just wanted&#13;
&#13;
             to say that without taking any part in this financial discussion myself.&#13;
&#13;
             I just read the papers and I see that out of the total of $24 million,&#13;
&#13;
             disbursements have been just $12 million.    I find that most unfortunate;&#13;
&#13;
             as I said before, these people are paying interest on dollars they do not&#13;
&#13;
             use.&#13;
CHAIRMA.N:   They are not paying full interest.    We are very anxious to do everything&#13;
&#13;
             we can to ease the cost of the loan.&#13;
TANSLEY:     Mr. PreSident, I only want to add one thing to the remarks on the question&#13;
&#13;
             of inflation.   In the particular case of Mexico, it is probably the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ANSLEY:   outstanding country where inflationary tendencies, as a whole, have a&#13;
(Contld)&#13;
           particular effect on the dollar reserves of the country.&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF:     That was the point about which Mr. Beteta expressed serious concern.&#13;
&#13;
           Every additional peso put out makes an impact on the gold reserves.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:     Vfuen you issue pesos in Mexico, does not it affect the general price level?&#13;
&#13;
           I wanted to ask Mr. Iliff if he had any information what Mexico is doing in&#13;
&#13;
           this regard.&#13;
                                                  to&#13;
ILIFF:,    The Minister told me that he had added/his reserves over the last three&#13;
&#13;
           months and he     hop~d   to continue to do so.    Before we went down I had heard&#13;
&#13;
           same rumors from New York that fresh devaluation was under consideration.&#13;
&#13;
           But I found no confirmation of this in Mexico City.          I asked Mr. Beteta&#13;
&#13;
           what would be the probable effect on Mexico of devaluation of the Western&#13;
&#13;
           European countries.        He told me that he thought the only serious&#13;
&#13;
           consequences would be that it might to some extent affect the Mexican&#13;
&#13;
           competitive position in the field of exports where they compete with&#13;
&#13;
           exports from British West Indian colonies; otherwise not a deleterious&#13;
&#13;
           effect.&#13;
BEYEN:     Mr. Chairman, I do not want this to be taken as a sort of unkind criticism&#13;
&#13;
           because, after all, we are new in the field we are operating in and it is&#13;
           quite understandable that things like this happen, things we would be well&#13;
&#13;
           advised to see where we had failed.        I would say that this    ~ort   of thing&#13;
&#13;
           is exactly the sort of thing the Bank was formed to avoid.          The failure&#13;
&#13;
           in the 1920 1 5   ,   to look into the general situation of a country, was the&#13;
&#13;
           main cause of much trouble in the 30'5.           It was not because people gave&#13;
&#13;
           loans without looking into projects, the main trouble was that they only&#13;
&#13;
           looked at the particular thing they were financing and not in the general&#13;
&#13;
           situation of the country.        The idea of the International Bank was that it&#13;
&#13;
           would examine the overall picture.        In our innocence we have fallen into&#13;
&#13;
           the old trap      ~    at the moment we negotiated and gave the loan to Mexico.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 .~YEN:      We decided to make the loan notwithstanding the financial problems.      At&#13;
(Cont td)&#13;
             that moment we should have looked into the particular aspect that we now&#13;
             have to face.   Both the Fund and the Bank were at fault in not looking at&#13;
&#13;
             this particular aspect of new investment in Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:    I agree with you that it is most important that the Bank appraise the&#13;
&#13;
              general economic and financial position of the country before starting&#13;
&#13;
              a project. We missed our guess in this case.     On the other hand, I am&#13;
&#13;
              sure that you are familiar that we are pursuing just this policy.&#13;
&#13;
 GARNERs     We appraised this particular problem and felt that the assurances of the&#13;
&#13;
             Mexican Government that they could furnish the pesos was a reasonable risk.&#13;
&#13;
             The facts have not justified our estimate,s but we certainly did not ignore&#13;
&#13;
             them.&#13;
 BEYEN:       Mr. Chairman, even though we are in the same building, it is impossible to&#13;
&#13;
             apportion the blame.   I think it is probably more on the part of the Fund&#13;
&#13;
             than on the Bank; however, the mistake was made somewhere in 1818 H Street.&#13;
 ILIFF:      There is one thing I feel I ought to say about this.     I actually put it&#13;
&#13;
             to Mr. Beteta when I was there, did he not think that perhaps this over-all&#13;
             development investment, the program was on too ambitious a scale, having&#13;
&#13;
             regard to the investment   resource~.   He said as things had turned out, yes,&#13;
&#13;
             But the Mexican budgetary situation had been worsened substantially by&#13;
&#13;
             the cost of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.&#13;
 BARANSKI:   But that is the old thing, it happened years ago.     It was not a recent&#13;
&#13;
             development.&#13;
&#13;
 ONARAN:     I would like to ask Mr. Iliff one thing.     The question is this:   has the&#13;
&#13;
              Central Bank any means of ocr-setting the inflationary effects of this loan?&#13;
&#13;
             I think the inflationary pressure will be there even if dollars are used&#13;
&#13;
              for imports, because if the proceeds of these dollars in pesos are again&#13;
&#13;
              lent to the market, the pressure will be the same.     It will depend on the&#13;
&#13;
              nature of the imports, whether they are consumption goods or investment&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IJNARAN:      goods.      The solution will be to ascertain whether the Mexican Central Bank:&#13;
(Cont1d)&#13;
             has any intention of offsetting the inflationary pressure on the peso by&#13;
&#13;
             proceeds of the dollar loan.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:        As far as I know, they have not.                    The only thing that they could do in order&#13;
&#13;
             to keep the situation in hand, is to squeeze the credit policy of the Bank:~&#13;
&#13;
             You must not forget squeezing means if they do not squeeze out our project,&#13;
&#13;
             they will have to reduce some other expenditure.                    It may be easier to cut out&#13;
&#13;
             this project from the budget because the ultimate consequence of further&#13;
&#13;
             squeezing is bound to create unemployment somewhere.&#13;
&#13;
 ILIFF:      The other matter            ~ich      we discussed with the Mexican authorities was the&#13;
&#13;
             present situation with regard to the Mexican Light and Power.                    There were&#13;
             two main issues involved there.                    One was the question of when the Mexican&#13;
             authorities proposed to promulgate the new electricity tariff, and the other&#13;
&#13;
             was the approval which is required under Mexican law, by the Mexican&#13;
&#13;
             authorities of the capital reorganization proposals of the Company.                    We got&#13;
&#13;
             these matters satisfactorily settled.                    The Mexican Government have adopted&#13;
&#13;
             a time schedule which will afford the company the necessary time to get&#13;
&#13;
              their notices out to the various bond-holders in order to give them an&#13;
&#13;
              opportunity to vote on the new proposal.                    The new tariff rates will be&#13;
              finally promulgated by the Mexican Government not later than December 9.&#13;
&#13;
              As I mentioned to the Board before, the Company was unwilling to send out&#13;
              circulars to security holders until this had happened.                    Meanwhile, the&#13;
&#13;
              Company is calling meetings of its First Mortgage bond holders in order&#13;
&#13;
             to get authority from them to postpone their maturities. We in the                     Bank:&#13;
&#13;
              will shortly have to Â·consider the extension of the short-term $10 million&#13;
&#13;
              credi t which we made to the Commission for re-lending to the Company, and&#13;
&#13;
              which matures on December 31.&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:   When will we be asked to do that?&#13;
&#13;
 ILIFF:      The Company have already made application to National Financiera for an&#13;
              0",+",:... ",4 An !&gt;nM   t.h"" l,f"nr; ~an   novernment are now preparing an application to us.&#13;
&amp;#12;   i..IFF :   UIWGUAY - We are still awaiting news from the Uruguayan Government about the&#13;
. (Cont'd)&#13;
              proposed loan and guarantee agreements which we submitted to them through&#13;
&#13;
              the Uruguay Ambassador late in October. We are also awaiting further&#13;
&#13;
              information about certain financial and tedlnical aspects of the proposals&#13;
&#13;
              which we would wish to put before the Board.   But we hope this particular&#13;
&#13;
              loan - the amount is about $)0 million - will be ready for the President to&#13;
&#13;
              submit to the Board during December.&#13;
&#13;
              The President has arranged to send a Bank Mission to the Far East, to visit&#13;
&#13;
              the PHILIPPINES, INDIA and THAILAlm, and possibly also to look in at Karachi&#13;
&#13;
              for an exchange of views with the CJovernment of PAKISTAN.    The Philippine&#13;
&#13;
              situation has been causing us a good deal of concern.     As the Board knows,&#13;
&#13;
              we have been looking at the possibility of financing to the extent of $15&#13;
&#13;
              million a hydroelectric project on the island of Luzon.      Technical studies&#13;
&#13;
              en these projects have been mere or less completed, but we feel there are&#13;
&#13;
              certain underlying features of the situation in the Philippines of which we&#13;
&#13;
              want to take a closer look on the spot before we decide to jump in.&#13;
&#13;
              The mission will go to Thailand at the request of the Thai authorities, who&#13;
&#13;
              wish us to look at a project for railway rehabilitation and improvement, and&#13;
&#13;
              an irrigation project in the central Plain of Thailand.      Mr. Rucinski of the&#13;
              Loan Department will head this Mission.   Mr. Basch of the Economic Department&#13;
&#13;
               will accompany him, and Mr. Ryan, who acted as railway consultant in&#13;
&#13;
              connection with the Indian loan, will go along to examine the railway&#13;
&#13;
              proposals.&#13;
&#13;
               With regard to India, the negotiations on the Bokaro-Konar project will be&#13;
&#13;
              resumed as soon as we get some additional information about costs, and after&#13;
&#13;
              the Damodar Valley Corporation, which is the corporation for promoting the&#13;
&#13;
              project, has appointed the Chief Engineer, and when he has had an opportunity&#13;
&#13;
               to examine the technical proposals.   At their request, General Vlheeler, is&#13;
&#13;
              assisting the corporation to find a suitable person for this post.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        15.&#13;
&#13;
 \RKIl~SON:     It has just occurred to me, that in the case of the Philippines, we have a&#13;
                situation where the Fund is very greatly concerned with the internal&#13;
                situation and is sending a mission which mayor may not be on its way.     This&#13;
&#13;
                is clearly a case where we must make sure that we do not give contradictory&#13;
&#13;
                 advice.   It would have been desirable to see if we cannot coordinate and&#13;
&#13;
                send missions simultaneously, to make a joint mission; it is always bad to&#13;
&#13;
                have two sets of people from the same building going over the same ground.&#13;
&#13;
                I do not know whether you were able to do that.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       The Fund has a mission going to other places too.   We   talked with them about&#13;
&#13;
                this.&#13;
BARANSKI:       I understand this mission, headed by Messrs. Rucinski and Basch, would go&#13;
&#13;
                 only to two countries.   You mentioned last time that it would also go to&#13;
&#13;
                India â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
 .EHRU:         I also heard they are going to Karachi at the request of the Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
                Government.   What are our relations with them at the moment?&#13;
CHAIlli'vIAN:   At the moment, the Pakistan Government is having discussions with the Fund,&#13;
&#13;
                with a view to joining the Fund and Bank.   The Minister of Finance was here&#13;
&#13;
                on a recent visit and had several conversations vdth us.     He is very anxious&#13;
&#13;
                for Pakistan to join and asked that we would send somaone out there am&#13;
&#13;
                have a talk, so that when membership was completed we would have someone&#13;
&#13;
                who knew the problem of the country.&#13;
ILIFF:          IRAQ - Mr. Burland of the Loan Department, and Mr. Svoboda, will leave on&#13;
&#13;
                November 12 for Baghdad, to continue discussions with the Iraq Government&#13;
                about the possibility of Bank investment operation in Iraq.     Two projects&#13;
&#13;
                have been put to us by the Government of Iraq, a flood control project on&#13;
&#13;
                the Tigris River, and a rehabilitation program for the Iraq state railways.&#13;
&#13;
                The Iraq Government have suggested that the Bank might consider financing&#13;
&#13;
                the dollar cost of equipment needed for flood control project, $8~ million.&#13;
&#13;
                Railway equipment would be sterling financing, and would amount to 2~ million&#13;
                pounds sterling.   The umerlying financial situation in Iraq at the moment&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            16.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â· .LLIFF:       is not particularly satisfactory.   The budget this year shows a substantial&#13;
 (Cont Cd)&#13;
                paper deficit.   There is this unfortunate difficulty about the Haifa pipeline&#13;
&#13;
                which the Government of Iraq has declined to reopen, and the result of their&#13;
&#13;
                attitude has been to deprive them of a substantial amount of oil royalties.&#13;
&#13;
                The amount of sterling oil royalties has increased as a result of devaluation.&#13;
&#13;
                My general appreciation of the Iraq financial situation is that while they&#13;
&#13;
                are in serious trouble today, in the long run they should be very comfortable,&#13;
&#13;
                50   the problem confronting us there is to discuss what short-term measures&#13;
&#13;
                can be taken to restore some order into the financial situation.&#13;
&#13;
                I have not mentioned Cuba, because Mr. Garner has been there, and possibly&#13;
&#13;
                he himself would like to say something about his visit to Havana.&#13;
&#13;
  CHAIRMAN:     Thank you very much.    Are there any further questions?&#13;
&#13;
  -'RESCIANIa   I have noticed an interesting point in Mr. Iliff's report.    The sending of&#13;
&#13;
                an expert to Turkey in order to study with the Turkish Government the&#13;
&#13;
                possibility of encouraging private irrvestment.   That is, I think, a most&#13;
&#13;
                important point, as ever-fone knows one of the principal tasks of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                in a few years will be the promotion of private investment.    One of the&#13;
&#13;
                main causes preventing private investment is the series of obstacles placed&#13;
&#13;
                by countries against foreign experts.    I think it would be very important&#13;
                to have an exchange of views with several governments in order to see&#13;
                whether it is possible to reduce, i f not abolish altogether such obstacles.&#13;
&#13;
                Is Turkey an exceptional case or is it part of the policy of the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
                have an exchange of views on this subject with various foreign governments?&#13;
&#13;
  CHAIRMAN:     I think Mr. Garner might answer that cpestion.&#13;
&#13;
  GARNER:       Well, when I got to Turkey I found this situation:    that looking at the back&#13;
&#13;
                history of Turkey the Turks themselves had never gone in much for industry.&#13;
&#13;
                When the new Turkish Republic was set up, there was very little industry&#13;
&#13;
                and very little knowledge of the operations of industry.     The business&#13;
&#13;
                people were not accustomed to going into industrial enterprises.     Some of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             17.&#13;
                          )&#13;
&#13;
uARNER:    the races which had carried on certain enterprises were excluded from&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
           Turkey.   The country had the situation of   a:   new government and very little&#13;
&#13;
           industry; not, I believe, on account of ideology but because of a vacuum.&#13;
&#13;
           The government experimented with direct governmental funding and operation&#13;
&#13;
           of industrf.   This went on for some years and I found on the part of the&#13;
&#13;
           government rome realization that that had not worked very satisfactorily.&#13;
&#13;
           However, I was given a pretty strong assurance that the trouble was that&#13;
&#13;
           the Turkish public, the capitalists, would not venture their capital.&#13;
&#13;
           On the other hand, I found on the part of the bus inessmen a feeling that&#13;
&#13;
           the government was not prepared to give adequate support.        It seemed to me&#13;
&#13;
           that there was a situation where the Bank, acting as a friend of both parties,&#13;
&#13;
           might study the situation and come forward with some solution that would try&#13;
&#13;
           to bring the parties into agreement.     I expressed that opinion to the Turkish&#13;
&#13;
           officials and as a result they extended an invitation to the Bank to send a&#13;
&#13;
           representative out to see i f we could bring forward a solution.       It is my&#13;
&#13;
           feeling that, if we are successful in Turkey, we would be glad to do the&#13;
&#13;
           same for other countries i f the countries would like us to do it.&#13;
&#13;
ONARAU:    I would like to add a few words to Mr. Garner's statement.&#13;
&#13;
           There are two kinds of private investment, private investment locally and&#13;
&#13;
           private investment outside.     The Turkish Government, as Mr. Garner said&#13;
&#13;
           very nicely, has realized that something should be done about this private&#13;
&#13;
           business because, of course, you cannot go on investing public money in&#13;
&#13;
           industrial affairs and leave out the private capital.        Both sides of this&#13;
&#13;
           question have been treated like this; the Government has taken authority&#13;
&#13;
           from the Parliament to guarantee the transfer of profits and capital of any&#13;
&#13;
           foreign investor at any time it thinks necessary to take the capital or&#13;
&#13;
           profi ts out of the co untry.   Now the Government is ready to make co ntracts&#13;
&#13;
           or to guarantee such transfer for foreign investors.        There is no discrimi-&#13;
&#13;
           nation of any kind between Turkish private capital investment and foreign&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             18.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â· vNARAN:     capital investment and the only problem was the possible difficulty of&#13;
(Cont Id)&#13;
              transferring it.    Now the   C~vernment   has taken a pledge that it is going&#13;
&#13;
              to permit foreign investors to take capital out.&#13;
&#13;
              In the second place, in domestic investment, as Mr. Garner said very ably,&#13;
&#13;
              there is a change of mind in Government also for the domestic side of this&#13;
&#13;
              picture.   The Parliament has passed a law lately authorizing the Finance&#13;
&#13;
              Minister to guarantee up to 200 million Turkish pounds, I believe, or $100&#13;
&#13;
              million to guarantee any local investor the dollars that he borrowed.          For&#13;
&#13;
              instance, i f a company set up in Turkey under the auspices of the Bank on&#13;
&#13;
              the one hand and also by protection of the Government on the other hand,&#13;
&#13;
              and the Bank makes a loan to this private company, the Turkish Government&#13;
&#13;
              will guarantee the loan from the Bank.        I think, therefore, there. is a change&#13;
&#13;
              of mind and views on the part of the Government on both of these questions.&#13;
 BRESCIANI:   Will they also guarantee against commercial losses?&#13;
 ONARAN:      The Government will guarantee a commercial loss because, i f the company&#13;
              cannot pay back loans from the Bank on account of losses, the Government&#13;
&#13;
              is guaranteeing the repayment of the dollars to the Bank.        That is, it&#13;
&#13;
              amounts to exactly the same thing.&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:    Thank you, Mr. iliff.&#13;
              Mr. Garner has just returned from a very interesting trip to Cuba with&#13;
&#13;
              Mr. Lopez-Herrarte and I an sure the Directors would like to hear something&#13;
&#13;
              about his experiences.     One experience I heard was that, when he first got&#13;
&#13;
              there, there was a parade held in Cuba which was to protest against a loan,&#13;
&#13;
              and when he left there was a parade in favor of the loan.        I thought you&#13;
&#13;
              might tell what occurred between these parades.&#13;
&#13;
 GARNER:      We went down to Cuba in response to an inntation from the President to&#13;
&#13;
              come down and try to clarify what the Cubans had in mind, having in mind&#13;
&#13;
              what the Bank position might be.      In addition to Mr. Lopez-Herrarte, a&#13;
&#13;
              representative of the legal firm of Sullivan, Donovan &amp; Heenehan in New&#13;
              York   went down.   Thev have been retained for legal advice regarding matters&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     19.&#13;
                                                               )&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
uARNER:    affecting new financing.&#13;
(Cont1d)&#13;
           I had a talk with the President the first morning in which he told us that&#13;
&#13;
           he felt that a substantial program of public works was essential to Cuba;&#13;
&#13;
           things such as roads, port development and other projects were important.&#13;
&#13;
           He also said that, Cuba having been one of the fortunate countries that&#13;
&#13;
           always benefits from a war instead of suffering from it, they had a very&#13;
&#13;
           high degree of prosperity and he was looking forward to the time when,&#13;
&#13;
           instead of selling 4~ to   5 million   tons of sugar, they would have to sell&#13;
&#13;
           less sugar at lower prices and, therefore, he felt the need of injecting&#13;
&#13;
           some additional credit into the picture.&#13;
&#13;
           I did not tell him anything new because of previous conversations he had&#13;
&#13;
           had with )o.ir. McCloy and Mr. Black as well as the fact that Mr. Lopez-Herrarte&#13;
&#13;
           had outlined the policies of the Bank to the Cubans last summer.        I was&#13;
&#13;
           really emphasizing and reiterating two or three points.       The first point&#13;
&#13;
           comes out in connection with the fact that most of these projects require&#13;
&#13;
           very little import of equipment.       Most of them are local currency expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
           I explained in great detail the position of the Bank with regard to loaning&#13;
&#13;
           dollars for local currency expenditure.       I think we made it abundantly clear&#13;
&#13;
           to them although they were confused as Cuba is in a strange situation because&#13;
&#13;
           for a long period the dollar was their currency.        I pointed out to them two&#13;
&#13;
           things:    that if the dollar was local currency we could not loan them dollars.&#13;
&#13;
           They asked the question, could you make a loan to the United states Govern-&#13;
&#13;
           ment?     I said not in dollars, but in francs or pesos.     We could not lend&#13;
&#13;
           the United States Government dollars and we could not lend the Cuban Govern-&#13;
&#13;
           ment dollars for peso expenditure.       The second thing:   under the new Central&#13;
&#13;
           Bank law one year after the bank begins operations the dollar will no longer&#13;
&#13;
           be legal currency and the country will go on a peso economy.        I told them&#13;
&#13;
           that, under our Articles and practice, we could not lend dollars for local&#13;
&#13;
           expenditures that we did not have any pesos unless the Cuban       C~vernment&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           20.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ~ARNER:    wanted to make them available out of their 18%.       The only possible way&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
           . the Bank would be able to get pesos would be to sell peso securities in&#13;
&#13;
            the Cuban market.   That was a possibility that might represent an exceptional&#13;
&#13;
            circumstance that would fit our Articles.   The other point I emphasized was&#13;
&#13;
            that we did not finance a large variety, over-all amount of public works&#13;
&#13;
            loans, that we would look at a specific project and make a start if we&#13;
&#13;
            were satisfied and then go on in moderate   &amp;~ounts    as good projects were&#13;
&#13;
            brought up.   The third point, which bears on what Mr. Beyen said, before&#13;
&#13;
            we could look at a project and assess the merit of any particular project&#13;
&#13;
            we would have to consider the Cuban economic and firuulcial situation.         They&#13;
&#13;
            would have to satisfy us that that was satisfactory and that they needed&#13;
&#13;
            to borrow, not having the resources themselves available to carry on a&#13;
&#13;
            reasonable program of investment.&#13;
&#13;
            I also pointed out that there were many indications that Cuba had very&#13;
&#13;
            substantial resources.&#13;
&#13;
             Having made that clear to the PresideIL, in accordance with the understanding&#13;
&#13;
            reached before I went down, told him that I was meeting with the press at&#13;
&#13;
            one o'clock on the first day and would be giving them a statement setting&#13;
&#13;
            forth the policies of the Bank, which I did.    In an hour's pr-ess conference,&#13;
            there was very lively questioning.&#13;
&#13;
            I am glad to say that the press reported very accurately, and the statement&#13;
&#13;
            of the Bank's position was very well handled.     In spite of that, I found&#13;
&#13;
            when I got down there that a bill had been introduced into the Senate which&#13;
&#13;
            was to be voted on that night, authorizing the President to contract loans&#13;
&#13;
            up to 200 million, and there was no mention of the Bank in the legislation.&#13;
&#13;
            We had never seen the legislation and it had never been discussed with us.&#13;
&#13;
            It was as a result of this legislation that a parade was organized against&#13;
&#13;
            the loans.    The papers were full of it, and I said that maybe I ought to&#13;
&#13;
            join the parade'&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              21.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-ARNER:     The Upper House passed the bill with one vote more than the necessary two-&#13;
(Cont 'd)&#13;
            thirds majority.    It is interesting to note that three of the opposition&#13;
&#13;
            senators called on us to say they were opposed to any general loan without&#13;
&#13;
            restrictions but they would not be opposed to any loans the Bank might make&#13;
&#13;
            because they knew the Bank would not make it without investigations and&#13;
&#13;
            necessary follow up.     If an appropriate loan was proposed from the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
            they said they would support it.           There were some most violent charges&#13;
&#13;
            and recriminations in the press and the radio. I           have ever heard, but in&#13;
&#13;
            spite of that, there was not a single criticism of the Bank, and a great&#13;
&#13;
            marw   people said i f the Bank   COIOOS    in, we know it will do a good job.     The&#13;
&#13;
            debate is going on, and as Mr. Black said, a parade is being organized this&#13;
&#13;
            afternoon chiefly on the part of labor to support the loan which is going&#13;
&#13;
            to the lower house in Congress.       When some members of the Government asked&#13;
&#13;
            me not to pay too much attention to the controversy, I said I was not&#13;
&#13;
            impressed by demonstrations and i f we made the loan, we would make it for&#13;
            a specific project.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   I think you might tell the Board the amendments to be put in the law.&#13;
&#13;
GAR1IER:    Apparently this legislation was desiened more trui.t with the idea of Cuba&#13;
&#13;
            being able to negotiate a loan with some private firms, than it applied&#13;
&#13;
            to transactions with the Bank.       However, this particular law has introduced&#13;
&#13;
            or changed the amount of their public borrowing that had previously been&#13;
&#13;
            discussed with the B&lt;3.t"1k.   They tell us that the loan will be spent in the&#13;
&#13;
            various provinces of Cuba according to population or according to national&#13;
&#13;
            interest, so it is easy to see that such authorization would raise serious&#13;
&#13;
            questions as to how anyone could determine as to whether the loan was used&#13;
&#13;
            for the best interests of the country.&#13;
&#13;
            National interest might need an increase or a decrease of births, but this&#13;
&#13;
            situation is affected by the climate regarding it.           We spent the balance&#13;
&#13;
            of that week talking to various Government officials, private bankers,&#13;
            both foreign and Cuban, business men, Cuban and American, and received a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              22.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
uARNER:     variety of views as regards the situation of Cuba and the conditions&#13;
(Cont fd)&#13;
            prevailing there.    Our friend Luis Machado who had not been brought into&#13;
            the conversations before our arrival, was not brought in at all, the&#13;
&#13;
            President saying he wanted to carry on these conversations himself.       However,&#13;
&#13;
            Luis met us at the airport    (Mr.   Lopez-Herrarte havine arrived early in the&#13;
&#13;
            day) and was not only very helpful to us, but a most delightful host.       He&#13;
&#13;
            enabled us to have some very pleasant golf and go down to the beach for the&#13;
&#13;
            week-end,   m. ich relieved the pressure of the hectic discussions that were&#13;
            going on.    The day before yesterday, I had a final discussion with the&#13;
&#13;
            President, in which I again reviewed the position of the Bank so that there&#13;
&#13;
            is no possibility of misunderstanding the things we could not do and the&#13;
&#13;
            things we could do, and as the reslut of that conversation, which lasted&#13;
&#13;
            three hours, he asked me if we would send down a mission to study and&#13;
&#13;
            recommend an economic program for Cuba, including a full study of the&#13;
&#13;
            firiancial position of the Government, financial and tax policies.      He said&#13;
&#13;
            cuba had no application before the Bank, and did not intend to make an&#13;
&#13;
            application for a loan until the studies were completed.       Based on those&#13;
            recommendations, if an agreement could be reached that a loan is in order,&#13;
&#13;
            then Cuba would ask the Bank to consider Ylhat kind of loan it might be in&#13;
            a position to make to Cuba.     I told him we would be prepared to send such&#13;
&#13;
            a miSsion.    It would take some little time, possibly a number of months,&#13;
&#13;
            as in the case of the Colombian mission, but we would proceed as pronply as&#13;
&#13;
            pOSSible, and we would be prepared to make the same arrangements as with&#13;
&#13;
            Colombia and Turkey, and share the costs.       He expressed appreciation of&#13;
&#13;
            the attitude of the Bank, and felt that maybe we could do some things&#13;
&#13;
            aside from a mission that would be a help to Cuba.       I told him that was&#13;
&#13;
            our job, and we were prepared to do all we could, and he said he thoroughly&#13;
&#13;
            understood there was no commitment, either moral-or otherwise, on the part&#13;
&#13;
            of the Bank, as to whether we would make any loan or not.       I pointed out&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            23.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ~ARNER:     we might come to the conclusion that Cuba had ample resources, both of&#13;
(Cont 'd)&#13;
             dollars and pesos, to carry on a reasonable development program without&#13;
             a loan.     If we felt that, we would tell him so.   If, on the other hand,&#13;
&#13;
             we felt Cuba needed a loan, we would be prepared to consider it.      It was&#13;
&#13;
             a very interesting and fascinating trip.     The situation in Cuba is pretty&#13;
&#13;
             good.     They had surprisingly good results from sugar this year.   They&#13;
&#13;
             expected a bad result, but sales only dropped ~ million.      The revenues&#13;
&#13;
             from sugar are pretty good and should continue for at least the next two&#13;
&#13;
             years as the market for sugar will be active at fairly good prices.         One&#13;
&#13;
             of the aspects we would consider was whether now was the time for Cuba to&#13;
&#13;
             go on an expanded program of investment or wait until deflation had gone&#13;
&#13;
             further.     One other point of interest.   The provisions of law provide that&#13;
&#13;
             banks, both Cuban and foreign, can invest certain of their reserves in&#13;
&#13;
             Cuban securities, or in certain public foreign securities.      We have raised&#13;
&#13;
             the question as to whether tt.e Bank bonds are eligible for that purpose.&#13;
&#13;
             Although the Central Bank is not yet actually operating, the Board is&#13;
&#13;
             constituted and has met and decided that our bonds are eligible. While&#13;
&#13;
             they would not take the initiative and issue a ruling to that effect, if&#13;
&#13;
             any bank request a ruling, they would make it and put that ruling to all&#13;
&#13;
             the banks.     That is a fairly important measure.   We have told some of the&#13;
&#13;
             banks accordingly and I am sure in a short time applications will be made.&#13;
&#13;
             Quite a sizeable amount of dollar reserves would be available for investment,&#13;
&#13;
             and I think it would be very helpful from the standpoint of the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
             have this new market open up.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMAN;   Thank you.&#13;
 Y{OOKER:    Is there any substance to tile report that the First Boston Corporation&#13;
&#13;
             will make a loan of some 30 million?&#13;
 GARNER:     I think it was planned for the First Boston Corporation to sit down am&#13;
&#13;
             talk about the loan which, in the first instance, was in the neighborhood&#13;
             of thirtv to forty million dollars.     I think. however, that investment&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    24.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:       bankers do not make commitments they will buy bonds until the plans have&#13;
(Cont 1 d)&#13;
              been worked up to a final basis.      The First Boston has not sent any people&#13;
&#13;
              down to make an investigation, and I think the thing is simply one of those&#13;
&#13;
             . possibilities.&#13;
&#13;
BARREDA:      A group of Cuban bankers were supposed to be prepared to take up a bond&#13;
&#13;
              issue; that was brought out in the newspapers.&#13;
&#13;
GARNER:       The story on that was that the Cuban banks had a great deal of pressure put&#13;
&#13;
              on them some weeks ago, to make some sort of offer to the Cuban Government&#13;
&#13;
              and they indicated that they believed that they were in a position to take&#13;
&#13;
              up an issue of thirty-five million pesos bonds of the Government.            However,&#13;
&#13;
              I did not find any who felt they were in a position to take a substantial&#13;
              amount of bonds and hold for investment, or that they would be able to sell&#13;
&#13;
              a substantial amount to Cuban capitalists.            That being so, I think it is the&#13;
&#13;
              case of an offer with a very big     "if"    in it.&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     (To )fi.r. Garner)   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
              A letter has been received from the Ambassador of Ceylon making application&#13;
&#13;
              for membership in the Bank.      They made a similar application for memberShip&#13;
&#13;
              in the Fund.      We plan to turn this application over to the Bank's Connnittee&#13;
&#13;
              on Membership for study and report.         The members of that Committee are&#13;
&#13;
              Messrs. Chang, Hoppenot, McFarlane and Toro.&#13;
              As you know, the Canadian Government made available from its 18% currency&#13;
&#13;
              the equivalent of $8 million to be used in connection with the Brazilian&#13;
&#13;
              Traction, Light and Power Company loan, and also partly to be used for&#13;
&#13;
              disbursement under our loan to the Mexican Light and Power Company.&#13;
&#13;
              We have found as a matter of fact, of the $8 million we have only called&#13;
&#13;
              on the Canadian Government for $1.5 million which leaves $6.5 million&#13;
&#13;
              still undisbursed.      The Brazilian '!'raction Company does not expect to&#13;
&#13;
              wi thdraw all of these Canadian dollars until probably December 1953, and&#13;
&#13;
              the same thing is true of the Mexican Light am Power Company.             HOllever,&#13;
&amp;#12;t..:HAIRMAN:   Canadian dollars is to be dravm down by next March.    We ma:de a special&#13;
 (Cont'd)&#13;
               request of the Canadian Government to allow us to now use the undisbursed&#13;
&#13;
               Canadian dollars which were to be used in the Brazilian Light and Mexican&#13;
&#13;
               Light loans, and the Canadian Government has shown real cooperation in&#13;
&#13;
               allowing us to do this.&#13;
&#13;
               I thought it might be interesting to the Directors to show just what this&#13;
&#13;
               amounts to, to the Bank.   If we used $6.5 million of borrowed United States&#13;
&#13;
               dollars in order to supply Canadian dollars on the Indian Loan, that money&#13;
&#13;
               would cost the Bank an average interest rate of 2.7%, so if we use Canadian&#13;
&#13;
               18% money, which costs the Bank nothing, we have saved the difference&#13;
&#13;
               between no cost and the cost on the $6.5 million borrowed dollars.     Uow&#13;
&#13;
               w:e have to deduct from that the income which we are now getting on the&#13;
&#13;
               borrowed U.S. dollars by the investment of these borrowed dollars in U.S.&#13;
&#13;
               Government Bonds.   Taking the yield of 1.25% on that money, we still save&#13;
&#13;
               $190 thousand.   So by the Canadian Government t s allowing us to use this&#13;
&#13;
               money immediately, rather than deferring the use for two, three or four&#13;
&#13;
               years, the Bank makes $190 thousarrl.&#13;
&#13;
               The Bank's second training course will begin in the middle of January and&#13;
&#13;
               will last until the end of December next year.&#13;
&#13;
               We have selected seven trainees and they have all been offered appointments&#13;
&#13;
               and they have ,all accepted.   Vie have one trainee from Ecuador, ene from&#13;
&#13;
               Lebanon, one from Italy, one from Norway, one from India, one from Iran&#13;
&#13;
               am one from the United Kingdom.&#13;
&#13;
               We considered 220 people for these seven places.    Fifty of these people&#13;
&#13;
               were officially nominated by member countries and the others were people&#13;
&#13;
               who came to our attention through various contacts.    The final selection&#13;
&#13;
               was made after very careful examination of all these candidates.     We sent&#13;
&#13;
               questionnaires to their former employers, professors at their univerSities,&#13;
&#13;
               and other people who knew all about them.    Then we had personal interviews&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        261&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
~HAIRMAN:   A selection committee composed of Mr. Mendels, Chairman, Messrs. Crena de&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
            Iongh, Rist Howell and Mr. Lejeune made the final choices.&#13;
&#13;
            In the last year's class, we had seven trainees.     This class is to be&#13;
&#13;
            finished in December.     Five of these trainees have accepted permanent&#13;
&#13;
            appointments on the staff of the Bank, a.nd two of them have decided to&#13;
&#13;
            go bac k home.&#13;
&#13;
            On November 15, there will be an information conference for industrialists&#13;
&#13;
            who are the principal suppliers for countries using the loan proceeds of&#13;
&#13;
            the Bank.    We have invited about 25 of these industrialists and we have&#13;
&#13;
            received a few acceptances.     We have the Treasurer of the M.W. Kellogg&#13;
&#13;
            Company, the Chairman of the Board of the Foster Wheeler Corporation, the&#13;
&#13;
            President of Internatior:ml General Electric Company, the President of&#13;
&#13;
            United states Steel Export Company, and a number of others.&#13;
&#13;
            We would like to know how many Directors can attend a luncheon on November 15,&#13;
&#13;
            Tuesday.    How many Directors can attend?    (show of hands)&#13;
&#13;
            On November 29, there will be another information conference.       This is&#13;
&#13;
            for an Eastern group of bankers and insurance executives, savings bank&#13;
&#13;
            executives.      I will ask you a little bit later about lunch then, but that&#13;
&#13;
            will be on November 29.     So i f you will make a note of that so that we can&#13;
&#13;
            have as many as possible for lunch then.&#13;
&#13;
            Just to advise the Directors, I have had some discussions and have been&#13;
&#13;
            giving a lot of thought to the possibility of doing some refunding of our&#13;
&#13;
            10-year bonds which are due in 1957. We had a talk with the Financial Policy&#13;
&#13;
            Committee the other day and explained to them our thinking along this line.&#13;
&#13;
            We have not got very far along with it and I just want to tell you that&#13;
&#13;
            we are thinking about it and talking about it so if you hear any remarks you&#13;
&#13;
            will be posted.     A little later on I will come to you with a more concrete&#13;
&#13;
            proposal, i f I decide to go on with it.&#13;
&#13;
            ]I   there is no other business, the next meeting of the Directors will probably&#13;
&amp;#12; lAIRMAN:   be held at 10:00 o'clock, Thursday, November 17. We picked that date&#13;
,Cont'd)&#13;
            because there are certain items that might come up by that time.   It is&#13;
            possible that we might change that date.   If there is no other business,&#13;
&#13;
            the meeting stands adjourned.&#13;

&#13;
            after the meeting.&#13;

&#13;
                                     ADJOURNED AT 11:50 a.m.&#13;
