  Strengthening Budget Mechanisms for Sanitation in Uganda&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The Government of Uganda has identified sanitation as a major potential contributor to the&#13;
achievement of national Poverty Eradication Action Plan objectives and Millennium&#13;
Development Goal targets. The September 2003 Joint Sector Review of water and sanitation&#13;
identified a need to review sanitation budgeting and financing mechanisms as part of an&#13;
overall strengthening of the sanitation sub-sector. This is expanded upon more in section 2.&#13;
&#13;
The terms of reference for this study identified three sanitation sub-sectors: household /&#13;
institutional sanitation in urban and rural areas (non-piped); urban sanitation in larger urban&#13;
areas and small towns (piped); and hygiene promotion in urban and rural areas. The study&#13;
has used the definition developed and agreed at a sanitation stakeholder workshop in Jinja,&#13;
Uganda in February 2004. This includes:&#13;
    · Safe disposal of human excreta (faeces and urine)&#13;
    · Good personal and domestic hygiene practices&#13;
    · Safe disposal of solid and liquid waste&#13;
    · Safe collection, storage and use of water, especially for drinking&#13;
    · Control of insect and rodent vectors such as flies, mosquitoes, rats etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Current institutional arrangements and resource flows&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Current institutional arrangements&#13;
The overall review of responsibilities presented in section 3 reveals that:&#13;
    ·    A significant proportion of sanitation related activities are undertaken by parties&#13;
         external to the sanitation Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministries of&#13;
         Health, Education and Sports, and Water, Lands and Environment&#13;
    ·    Ministries and some NGOs prepare and disseminate hygiene promotion materials ­&#13;
         there is more scope for sharing these&#13;
    ·    Ministry of Health field workers combine both hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
         enforcement functions (but anecdotal evidence suggests that on the enforcement&#13;
         side, bad sanitation practices rarely lead to prosecutions)&#13;
    ·    Responsibility for setting sanitation policies, developing guidelines, setting&#13;
         regulations and monitoring is particular widely split across institutions (although the&#13;
         Ministry of Health tends to do more work in these areas)&#13;
    ·    A broad range of institutions are involved in toilet construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ·   Fewer institutions are involved in urban sewerage and solid waste management&#13;
         functions&#13;
     ·   There are apparent overlaps between central and local government responsibilities&#13;
         for many activities&#13;
It should be emphasised that having a responsibility does not preclude the involvement of&#13;
other partners to assist in a sanitation related activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Current financial resource flows&#13;
&#13;
With respect to funding, section 3 also sets out the multitude of `on-budget' sources of&#13;
finance provided by mechanisms such as conditional grants, development programmes and&#13;
equalisation grants, as well as a range of potential `off-budget' finance sources from the&#13;
private sector, credit organisation, non government organisations and communities. Over&#13;
the past three years or so, there has been a significant change in the way international&#13;
development partners support sanitation (and other) programmes in Uganda ­ most money&#13;
is now channelled as general budget support, rather than being assigned to specific projects&#13;
as it was in the past.&#13;
Under current budget mechanisms, it is difficult to obtain estimates of how much money is&#13;
spent on sanitation activities, and many assumptions have to be made. However, in the time&#13;
available for this study, the following assessments have been made based on estimates&#13;
developed:&#13;
     ·   Total sanitation expenditure appears to have fluctuated over the past 5 years ­ once&#13;
         inflation is taken into account, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that&#13;
         overall funding levels have risen or fallen in real terms for the period as a whole&#13;
     ·   It is estimated that on-budget resources have ranged from about UShs 11 to 17&#13;
         billion per annum, another UShs 1 billion or so may have been contributed by&#13;
         NGOs each year (this figure needs further review), and additional amounts of up to&#13;
         UShs 5 billion per annum have recently being targeted on improving sanitation in&#13;
         Kampala&#13;
     ·   Since 1998/99, the estimated amount of total on-budget sanitation finance going&#13;
         through the budget for the Department of Water Development has fallen from 46%&#13;
         to 18% whilst the proportion under the Ministry of Education has risen from 14 to&#13;
         47%; the proportion under the Ministry of Health has stayed fairly constant at 16 to&#13;
         17%&#13;
     ·   Over the past 5 years, it is estimated that between 37 to 63% of on-budget funds&#13;
         have gone towards the construction of latrines in schools (mainly in newly&#13;
         constructed primary schools)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     Strengthening Budget Mechanisms For Sanitation-Uganda&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ·    Over the same period, there appears to have been some movement from large&#13;
         towns towards small town / rural focused expenditure ­ by 2002/03, approximately&#13;
         one and a half times as much on-budget money was targeted at the latter&#13;
    ·    On equity grounds, there are some arguments for spending an even higher&#13;
         proportion of money in rural areas as approximately 85% of Ugandans live in these&#13;
         places (and additional people live in small towns) ­ but this would need to be&#13;
         balanced by the fact that the cost of providing someone with adequate sanitation in&#13;
         urban areas is higher&#13;
    ·    There are also equity issues surrounding the allocation of resources in urban areas,&#13;
         since the majority of on-budget expenditure there is spent on piped sewerage ­&#13;
         quite often, less than 10% of the urban population actually have access to this&#13;
    ·    Analysis of the types of on-budget sanitation spending suggest that for the 5 years&#13;
         until 2002/03: piped urban sewerage has accounted for 13 to 21% of the total;&#13;
         latrine construction (predominantly in primary schools and public places) for 47 to&#13;
         62%; hygiene promotion for 20 to 27%; solid waste collection, vector control etc.&#13;
         for 2%; management and training for 2 to 8%&#13;
It could be argued that there is a very unbalanced allocation of resources for sanitation based&#13;
on who benefits from expenditure. Around three quarters of funds appear to have been&#13;
targeted on a very small percentage of beneficiaries though school and public latrines and&#13;
sewerage. Only an estimated quarter has been targeted at the vast majority of people who&#13;
reside in rural households or poor urban areas. This needs to be reviewed through a sector-&#13;
wide sanitation strategy as discussed further in sections 5 and 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Comparison of responsibilities with funding flows&#13;
An overall comparison of responsibilities with funding sources suggests that more resources&#13;
and budget mechanisms are particularly needed to finance:&#13;
    ·    Continuous sanitation and hygiene promotion&#13;
    ·    Construction of latrines in older primary schools and in secondary schools&#13;
    ·    Maintenance and rehabilitation of latrines in schools&#13;
    ·    Sanitation services, drainage and waste disposal facilities for the urban poor&#13;
At present, it is difficult to get 100% accurate data to assess resource flows (fund allocation&#13;
and utilisation) for sanitation and there is an important need to improved data collection&#13;
systems.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Constraints and opportunities for better resource use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Scope for increasing the amount of sanitation resources&#13;
In order to encourage an increase in the amount of resources for sanitation, the following&#13;
actions are suggested in section 4:&#13;
    ·   Revise guidelines for the water and sanitation conditional grant so that more priority&#13;
        is given to sanitation activities&#13;
    ·   Enforce the guidelines that state that water points should only be provided if there&#13;
        is adequate improvement in hygiene practices&#13;
    ·   Revise the guidelines for the primary health care conditional grant, emphasising the&#13;
        importance of environmental health and how this can contribute to improved health&#13;
        outcomes and to reducing future curative health expenditure&#13;
    ·   Review the scope for subsidisation of sanitation (as part of the wider water and&#13;
        sanitation sector policy study)&#13;
    ·   Prepare and implement guidelines so that the 8 regional Technical Support Units&#13;
        can more effectively support sanitation&#13;
    ·   Provide training to District Health Officers to prepare better sanitation plans and&#13;
        budgets&#13;
    ·   Explore partnerships with NGOs and private sector companies to support hygiene&#13;
        awareness programmes&#13;
    ·   Encourage greater use of community resources and pilot innovate approaches to&#13;
        this, for example through the use of micro-credit facilities&#13;
    ·   Take advantage of opportunities to work within on-going health programmes such&#13;
        as malaria control and guinea worm eradication, and to use Area Health Support&#13;
        Teams to promote sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Scope for improving the use of sanitation resources&#13;
Section 4 also sets out some ideas for making better use of resources provided for sanitation.&#13;
These include:&#13;
    ·   Assess the likely impact of spending a higher proportion of resources on hygiene&#13;
        promotion and enforcement and adjust conditional grant guidelines accordingly&#13;
    ·   Develop an improved strategy for improved hygiene education in schools&#13;
    ·   Consider reviewing allocation criteria for conditional grants so that more money is&#13;
        allocated to those districts / municipalities with lower current levels of sanitation (if&#13;
        support for this is given by local government)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ·    Pilot and disseminate to local governments new and cost-effective approaches to&#13;
         sanitation that are identified as part of the on-going study by the Environmental&#13;
         Health Division&#13;
    ·    Review and lobby for appropriate district reporting formats so that the allocation&#13;
         and impact of sanitation expenditure is easier to assess&#13;
    ·    Agree key or `golden' indicators for sanitation, define targets and cascade these&#13;
         down to local government (these can be taken from the overall water and sanitation&#13;
         performance measurement framework)&#13;
    ·    Publish district / municipality performance on sanitation by key indicator in the&#13;
         annual water and sanitation sector report (`performance league tables')&#13;
    ·    Identify and cost best models of local government sanitation coordination and&#13;
         disseminate these as part of the `good practice' models being developed by the&#13;
         Environmental Health Division of the Ministry of Health&#13;
    ·    Identify and cost best models of community sanitation monitoring and disseminate&#13;
         these as part of the `good practice' models being developed by the Environmental&#13;
         Health Division of the Ministry of Health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Estimates of funding gaps and potential&#13;
&#13;
Future resource availability&#13;
Section 5 assesses the amount of resources that are potentially available for sanitation&#13;
activities under current overall plans.&#13;
    ·    In 2002/03, the estimated sanitation expenditure of UShs 14 billion represented&#13;
         around 6% of the on-budget funds that were potentially available for sanitation (and&#13;
         other) expenditures from all the relevant conditional, development and other grant&#13;
         sources&#13;
    ·    The overall GoU potential resource `pot' (including various budget lines in MoH,&#13;
         DWD, MoES and local government budgets) that can also be accessed for&#13;
         sanitation activities is planned to increase by almost 40% over the next three years,&#13;
         but there will be many competing demands for this money&#13;
    ·    If sanitation funding continued to account for around 6% of the potential `pot' then&#13;
         around UShs 19 billion would be available form on-budget sources by 2005/06 - if&#13;
         the proportion could be increased to 10%, then UShs 32 billion would be available&#13;
         by the same date. However, allocation to appropriate sanitation activities for this&#13;
         would require work on measures such as those discussed in the previous section.&#13;
Estimates for 2002/03 suggest that of the potential funding sources within each Ministry&#13;
(including conditional grants) that could be spent on sanitation, the Ministry of Education&#13;
and Sports spent 12% on sanitation, the Directorate of Water Development 5% and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     Strengthening Budget Mechanisms For Sanitation-Uganda&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ministry of Health 3%.        Very small amounts are used for sanitation form the Local&#13;
Government Development Programme, possibly reflecting low prioritisation of sanitation at&#13;
the local level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Future resource needs&#13;
&#13;
Also in section 5, various previous studies that estimate sanitation investment needs are&#13;
summarised and the aggregated resource requirement is compared to trends and likely&#13;
availability of funds. The estimated stated annual investment needs for sanitation are UShs&#13;
47 billion and this would represent 20% of the total funds potentially available for sanitation&#13;
for 2002/03 from the various on-budget sources (but note that this is only one estimate that&#13;
would need careful review). This would represent a significant increase on the estimated 6%&#13;
that is currently spent on sanitation form various conditional, development and other grants.&#13;
However, it is strongly recommended that the sanitation `funding gap' is recalculated after&#13;
developing a sanitation strategy as discussed in section 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Scope for increasing finance from non-public sources&#13;
A good way of raising extra funds to plug the potential `funding gap' is to explore the&#13;
possibility of levering more off-budget resources. The scope for this is assessed at the end&#13;
of section 5. The analysis suggests that there have been limited successes in Uganda, and&#13;
that further attempts could be made, for example by:&#13;
     · Piloting the use of a sanitation levy on water sales to fund a broad range of&#13;
         sanitation activities in urban areas&#13;
     · Encouraging use of micro-credit as a way of raising money for commercial activities,&#13;
         household toilets and community sanitation projects&#13;
     · Exploring build-own-operate contracts or leasing options for the construction,&#13;
         operation and maintenance of al public latrines&#13;
     · Exploring partnerships with soap manufacturers to part-fund a national sanitation&#13;
         awareness campaign&#13;
     · Replicating models for contracting / coordinating with NGOs to provide hygiene&#13;
         promotion services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic directions for budget mechanisms&#13;
A three-dimensional strategic approach for sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Section 6 draws together&#13;
a lot of the analysis            Access to sanitation                     Sanitation promotion ­&#13;
                                facilities ­ `Sanitation               `Sanitation is foremost about&#13;
contained in previous               as a business'                           behaviour change'&#13;
sections.   To facilitate&#13;
the    development    of&#13;
budget mechanisms, it             Supply                   Accelerated                 Demand&#13;
                                                      sanitation and hygiene&#13;
would    be   useful  to                               improvement at scale&#13;
develop      a   revised&#13;
strategic framework for&#13;
                                                                             Facilitation&#13;
sanitation as a whole.&#13;
The proposed way for&#13;
                                                       Enabling environment&#13;
doing this is shown in&#13;
the Figure opposite.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation funding requirements based on an integrated strategic plan&#13;
Future resource needs can then be determined for each of these three dimensions for&#13;
accelerating sanitation and hygiene improvement at scale. This might best be done through&#13;
the development of an integrated and sector-wide strategic plan for sanitation, which sets&#13;
out:&#13;
    · Objectives and main components&#13;
    · Targets for each key component&#13;
    · Detailed activities, costs and expenditure requirements&#13;
    · Institutional responsibilities (national, local and across different Ministries and&#13;
         Departments)&#13;
    · Resourcing requirements at national and local levels&#13;
&#13;
The information and recommendations in sections 4 and 5 of this report would be useful in&#13;
the development of this strategic plan and the assessment of funding requirements. Another&#13;
important issue to address will be to clearly distinguish between national and local funding&#13;
requirements:&#13;
    · National level activities will be performed though departments in different Ministries&#13;
         and might cover activities such as: media advocacy (EHD), TSU support roles&#13;
         (DWD), Area Support Team activities (MoH) etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     Strengthening Budget Mechanisms For Sanitation-Uganda&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    · Local level activities will be run through local governments at municipality, district&#13;
        and sub-county levels and might cover activities such as: household hygiene&#13;
        promotion by community health workers, toilets in schools etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Establishing sanitation budget mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
Once funding requirements are clearly documented, it will be possible to clarify budget&#13;
mechanisms. For national level activities, it will be essential to understand very clearly the&#13;
way in which the budgets of each relevant ministry (and department) are organised and to&#13;
identify existing or new budget lines for different needed activities. For local activities the&#13;
guidelines and use of different conditional grants will need to be reviewed to assess the&#13;
potential scope of using these funds. Possibilities within the new FDS budget guidelines will&#13;
also need to be explored. In this context, it is also necessary to identify ways of providing&#13;
incentives to local governments to undertake appropriate sanitation related activities.&#13;
It would be also useful to explore other non-public sources such as household and&#13;
community resources through own construction or connection / user charges, private sector&#13;
funding through public-private partnerships (e.g. for hand-washing campaigns, through lease&#13;
for public toilets, etc.) or through micro-finance for household toilets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
An integrated budget management framework&#13;
Section 6 also sets out an example national sanitation budget management framework&#13;
matrix. All key activities are listed down the left hand side and all sources of funds are listed&#13;
across the top. The framework also contains an assessment of planned outputs at the far&#13;
right hand side. The advantages of using an approach like this would include:&#13;
    ·    It provides a framework for the integration of all institutional budgets&#13;
    ·    It helps to illustrate where the funding gaps are&#13;
    ·    It provides a better method for arguing for resources from the Ministry of Finance&#13;
    ·    It shows how resource use can be linked to outputs and a set of outputs leading to&#13;
         desired sanitation and health outcomes&#13;
    ·    It provides a method for monitoring both the use and the impact of funds&#13;
&#13;
A similar budgeting framework could be cascaded down to the district level and below. To&#13;
minimise the amount of work required at the district level, and to assess performance against&#13;
the expenditure in the sector as a whole, it might be better to combine sanitation into either&#13;
a health or water budget management framework matrix.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Resource allocation principles&#13;
Section 6 discusses three types of resources allocation within the sanitation sub-sector:&#13;
     ·    Allocation between the different types of sanitation expenditure&#13;
     ·    Allocation between rural, small town and urban sanitation&#13;
     ·    Allocation between districts and municipalities&#13;
&#13;
Experience around the world provides evidence that well-targeted investment in hygiene&#13;
promotion can have a significantly greater impact on sustaining sanitation improvement than&#13;
public investment in latrine and toilets. Based on the sector-wide strategy, the Sanitation&#13;
sub-sector working group (SSWG) would be able to agree on broad percentage breakdowns&#13;
between software activities (such as hygiene promotion) and hardware expenditure on&#13;
infrastructure. Over time, the proportion of resources devoted to hardware should fall,&#13;
compensated by more off-budget finance provided by the private sector, NGOs and&#13;
communities for capital expenditure. This may imply a greater proportion of on-budget&#13;
sanitation funding via the Ministry of Health.&#13;
&#13;
Data presented in section 3 of this report estimates that in 1998/99 approximately equal&#13;
amounts of sanitation money was spent on rural / small towns combined and on large&#13;
towns. By 2002/03, approximately one and a half times as much money was targeted at the&#13;
former group. The agreement of the allocation between rural, small towns and urban areas&#13;
is subjective and is to a large extent a political decision. However, the fact that almost 90%&#13;
of Ugandans live in rural areas, and that the majority of poor people live in rural areas,&#13;
provides some argument for increasing resource allocation in those places.&#13;
It should also be remembered that most urban sector investment benefits those people with&#13;
piped sewerage who often account for 25% or less of the urban population. Having said&#13;
this, it is only certain types of sanitation resourcing that can be influenced in this way, such&#13;
as the overall amounts allocated to any urban and rural sanitation projects. Under the Fiscal&#13;
Decentralisation Strategy, an increasing amount of resource allocation decisions are being&#13;
made at the local government level and so lobbying to boost the profile of sanitation at this&#13;
level will be a main way in which resources can be increased (in both urban and rural&#13;
areas).Given the limited available information, it has not been possible to review sanitation&#13;
resource allocation across the districts and municipalities of Uganda. In reviewing the&#13;
allocation of resources, various other factors should also be considered. In line with national&#13;
and sector policy objectives, more money should go to those parts of the country with:&#13;
&#13;
Higher levels of poverty (to meet poverty reduction strategy goals)&#13;
     ·    Lower levels of current basic sanitation (to meet `some for all rather than all for&#13;
          some' policy goals)&#13;
     ·    Higher chances of making a significant improvement in performance (in line with&#13;
          public sector efficiency goals)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The SSWG should review how resources are currently allocated between districts as part of&#13;
the WSCG, PHCCG and SFG, and see how this coincides with poverty levels and with&#13;
current sanitation profiles. Assuming that it is those parts of the country with lowest&#13;
sanitation indicators that have the biggest chances of improving performance, there should&#13;
be lobbying to assign more resources to those places. This will need to be combined with&#13;
careful monitoring (perhaps using a budget management framework like that presented in&#13;
section 6) so that efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources can be checked. It&#13;
needs to be emphasised that major resource allocation changes will not occur without&#13;
changes to the priorities of decision makers at local government levels. The `lobbying' role&#13;
will therefore be crucial.&#13;
Finally, it is worth emphasising that the information contained in this report should be&#13;
linked into the broader resource allocation review currently being conducted for the&#13;
Directorate for Water Development as well as the ongoing exercise for preparing the Health&#13;
Sector Strategic Plan II (HSSP II). A case should be made for a greater and a better&#13;
allocation of resources for sanitation related activities wherever possible.&#13;

            Strengthening budget mechanisms for
            sanitation in Uganda : executive summary
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Government of Uganda has identified
            sanitation as a major potential contributor to the
            achievement of national Poverty Eradication Action Plan
            objectives and Millennium Development Goal targets. The
            September 2003 joint sector review of water and sanitation
            identified a need to review sanitation budgeting and
            financing mechanisms as part of an overall strengthening of
            the sanitation sub-sector. The terms of reference for this
            study identified three sanitation sub-sectors: household /
            institutional sanitation in urban and rural areas
            (non-piped); urban sanitation in larger urban areas and
            small towns (piped); and hygiene promotion in urban and
            rural areas. The study has used the definition developed and
            agreed at a sanitation stakeholder workshop in Jinja, Uganda
            in February 2004. This includes: i) safe disposal of human
            excreta; ii) good personal and domestic hygiene practices;
            iii) safe disposal of solid and liquid waste; iv) safe
            collection, storage and use of water, especially for
            drinking; and v) control of insect and rodent vectors such
            as flies, mosquitoes, rats etc.
