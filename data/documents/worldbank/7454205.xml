SOUTH-SOUTH CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT: THE WAY TO GROW?&#13;
By Ajay Tejasvi, World Bank Institute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    A growing body of evidence suggests that learning and cooperation among developing nations is increas-&#13;
    ing in both frequency and complexity and expanding from just economic cooperation to include a variety&#13;
    of topics: health, education, communication, research, and development. Due to shared backgrounds and&#13;
    challenges, people in developing nations are banding together as peers to find new and innovative solu-&#13;
    tions to development issues. Reviews of technical cooperation suggest that South-South learning is often&#13;
    more effective in developing capacity than one-way knowledge transfers from the North. This brief identi-&#13;
    fies trends in this phenomenon for practitioners of capacity development and highlights some successful&#13;
    cases of South-South learning and cooperation.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
  Since the mid-1990s, the global South has seen             tion. At present, 43 percent of the South's trade is with&#13;
dramatic growth.1 The number of people living below          other developing countries, which accounts for about&#13;
US$1 a day has fallen by more than 390 million since         11 percent of global trade. South-South trade is also&#13;

annual growth has surpassed 5 percent in 15 coun-&#13;
tries, accompanied by diversification of economies and&#13;
                                                             What Is South-South Cooperation Really About?&#13;
exports. The improved economic performance reflects&#13;
some important political and economic policy changes&#13;
throughout the developing world. One such indicator            South-South learning and cooperation is about&#13;
is the fact that China will this year, for the first time,   developing countries working together to find solu-&#13;

            South-South capacity development : the way
            to grow?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A growing body of evidence suggests that
            learning and cooperation among developing nations is
            increasing n both frequency and complexity and expanding
            from just economic cooperation to include a variety of
            topics: health, education, communication, research, and
            development. Due to shared backgrounds and challenges,
            people in developing nations are banding together as peers
            to find new and innovative solutions to development issues.
            Reviews of technical cooperation suggest that South-South
            learning is often more effective in developing capacity than
            one-way knowledge transfers from the North. This brief
            identifies trends in this phenomenon for practitioners of
            capacity development and highlights some successful cases of
            South-South learning and cooperation.
