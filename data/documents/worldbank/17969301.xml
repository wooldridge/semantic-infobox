                          Coady, E. Patrick&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by William Becker and David Milobsky, on 1993-04-&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In late 1988, Coady joined the U.S. Administration at the request&#13;
of a former partner, Nicholas Brady, then Secretary of the Treasury,&#13;
and agreed to put himself forward as a potential U.S. Executive&#13;
Director (ED) at the Bank. He had very little understanding of the&#13;
Bank, since his background dealt mostly with international merchant&#13;
banking. Coady speaks of his dual role both as representative of the&#13;
U.S. and as spokesman to the U.S. for the Bank, the uniqueness of the&#13;
U.S. position in the Bank, and the long history of tension with other&#13;
member countries. According to Coady, at the time of his arrival, the&#13;
traditional U.S. Government agencies (Treasury, State Department, AID)&#13;
working with the Bank all had long established working relationships&#13;
in place, this included the official channel between The Treasury and&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Coady covers the workings of the Board and the great lengths it&#13;
pursues to abide by its tradition of reaching consensus; Management's&#13;
Board strategy of "divide and conquer"; runs a comparison between&#13;
presidents Conable and Preston in terms of Management relations with a&#13;
live-in Board which meets frequently and where the Articles give it&#13;
more powers than a normal board; and comments favorably on the&#13;
composition of the then newly elected board resulting in greater&#13;
consensus on most lending issues from both the donor and borrowing&#13;
side. In addressing the reasons for the Board's ineffectiveness in&#13;
policy-making, Coady sites as a factor the level of communication, or&#13;
lack thereof, due to the increasing distrust between Board and&#13;
Management, and the Board's tendency to micro-manage issues due to the&#13;
&amp;#12;long history of endless debate on clarifying the rights of the Board&#13;
and Management. Coady also blames the existing process, gives his&#13;
opinion on a remedy, and welcomes the exercise of redefining the Bank&#13;
and its major policies as well as the review of Board procedures&#13;
resulting in streamlining the policy formulation process as an&#13;
important reform in streamlining procedures, thus allowing time to&#13;
focus more on policy and country-assistance strategies and less on&#13;
micro-management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Coady addresses in detail IFC's request in January '90 for a $250&#13;
million capital increase, his involvement therein, IFC's rationale&#13;
versus that of the U.S. The Knapp Commission report's analysis of the&#13;
Bank's commitment to the private sector, the isolation of the U.S. in&#13;
the debate and eventually exercising their veto power in not&#13;
supporting the capital increase based largely on a Board that&#13;
admittedly did not believe in the policy framework put forth. The&#13;
mishandling by the press and the separate request by the U.S. for the&#13;
Bank to do a study of its Articles to determine the limitations on its&#13;
ability to support the private sector, and the Knapp Report's Private&#13;
Sector Development Action Plan covering the collaboration between the&#13;
Bank and IFC in light of their wide cultural and operational&#13;
differences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Coady broadly discusses the environment issue in the Bank with&#13;
which he had become closely identified, his involvement in the&#13;
creation of a new forestry policy paper, and heading the U.S.&#13;
delegation of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) proposed by the&#13;
Germans and the French. The Bank running the GEF Trust Fund and its&#13;
role as its principal project implementer encouraging a proper&#13;
relationship between the environment and development. The GEF as a&#13;
mechanism encouraging countries to address their local and&#13;
international environmental responsibilities simultaneously, hence&#13;
having a policy framework integrating both local and global&#13;
instruments. Coady mentions the huge strides made by the Bank toward&#13;
making the environment a central concern of development projects in&#13;
&amp;#12;light of the criticism received from environmental groups. Coady&#13;
concludes with his opinion on the pros and cons of the Bank's salary&#13;
system and its effects on the human resource dimension.&#13;
