           Africa Social Safety Net and Social Protection Assessment Series&#13;
&#13;
Until recently, most countries in Africa implemented safety nets and social protection programs only on an&#13;
ad hoc basis. In the wake of the global economic, food and fuel price crises starting in 2008, however,&#13;
policymakers in Africa began to increasingly view safety nets as core instruments for reducing poverty,&#13;
addressing inequality, and helping poor and vulnerable households to manage risk more effectively.&#13;
During FY2009-2013, to support governments in their quest to understand better how to improve the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of safety nets in their countries, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Africa Region undertook&#13;
social safety net or social protection assessments in a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2014&#13;
assessments have been completed or are under preparation for over 25 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
These assessments analyze the status of social protection programs and safety nets, their strengths and&#13;
weaknesses and identify areas for improvement, all with the aim of helping governments and donors to&#13;
strengthen African safety net systems and social protection programs to protect and promote poor and&#13;
vulnerable people. They were all carried-out with the explicit aim of informing governmentsâ&#128;&#153; social&#13;
protection policies and programs. With the results of analytical work like these assessments and other&#13;
types of support, safety nets and social protection programs are rapidly changing across Africa. For a&#13;
cross-country regional review, please see "Reducing Poverty and Investing in People: The New Role of&#13;
Safety Nets in Africa," which pulls together the findings and lessons learned from these assessments and&#13;
other recent studies of safety net programs in Africa.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Abstract&#13;
&#13;
The Government of Togo has made important advances in the area of social protection.&#13;
Although Togo has had limited social protection programs, the economic shock and natural&#13;
disasters starting in 2008 brought the need for better mechanisms of social protection to&#13;
the fore. The Government response has focused on measures to address the immediate&#13;
needs of the affected populations, while building the analytical base for developing a&#13;
national social protection policy. This report forms part of the overall analytical work&#13;
prepared to support the formation of a national social protection policy. It finds that the&#13;
most common safety net programs are in-kind transfers with limited coverage. It proposes&#13;
basic elements for the Government to take into consideration in developing a national&#13;
social protection policy and strategy and identifies next steps in finalizing the preparation of&#13;
such a policy and strategy.&#13;

This report was prepared by a World Bank team with support from the Government of Togo&#13;
and the members that make up the Social Protection Sectoral Committee of the PRSP&#13;
process. Task team leader was Setareh Razmara (AFTSP) and team members were Julie Van&#13;
Domelen (principal author, consultant), Elena Celada (consultant, AFTSP) and Anne Mossige&#13;
(AFTSP). The team received technical guidance and comments from John Elder (HDNSP),&#13;
Carlo del Ninno (AFTSP), Guiseppe Zampaglione (LCCHN), Christophe Lemiere (AFTHE), and&#13;
Will Weissman (AFTSP) during the internal review process. Translation was provided by&#13;
Anne-Marie Blouin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The report draws from a series of background reports prepared by the Government and&#13;
with support of various donors, including the World Bank, UNICEF, ILO, and UNDP over the&#13;
last three years on different aspects of social protection in Togo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
An initial draft of the report was reviewed in a national workshop in Togo in March 2012&#13;
presided by the Ministry of Work, Employment and Social Security, with attendance by the&#13;
key ministries and agencies of the Government as well as international partners active in&#13;
social protection in Togo. During that workshop, the ILO provided technical support to carry&#13;
out an initial costing exercise. This final version incorporates the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s comments&#13;
as well as summary results of the costing exercise.&#13;

Objectives and Context&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Over the last several years, the Government of Togo has made important advances in the&#13;
area of social protection. Although Togo has had limited social insurance and social&#13;
assistance programs, the economic shock and natural disasters starting in 2008 brought the&#13;
need for better mechanisms of social protection to the fore. The Government response has&#13;
focused on measures to address the needs of the affected populations, while building the&#13;
analytical base for developing a national social protection policy and strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As part of developing the analytical base for a national social protection policy and strategy,&#13;
a series of studies and analyses were carried out over the last two years. International&#13;
development partners have supported this effort and have worked closely with the&#13;
Government in developing this basis. This report synthesizes the situational analysis on&#13;
poverty and vulnerability and the current state of social protection policies and programs&#13;
from this set of background documents and attempts to assist the Government by providing&#13;
general orientations and strategic choices in developing a national social protection policy&#13;
and strategy that would integrate the various ongoing efforts and components of social&#13;
protection with a view to achieving the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s longer-term goal of social protection&#13;
for all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The development of social protection policies and programs need to be based on the&#13;
specific profile of risks and vulnerabilities in Togo. Although falling slightly over the last 5&#13;
years, poverty remains deeply entrenched in Togo, with 3.6 million Togolese living below&#13;
the poverty line out of a national population of 6.2 million. Poverty remains concentrated in&#13;
the rural areas. The poorest regions remain those farthest from the coast. Poverty is higher&#13;
among households headed by someone over 55 years old compared to younger&#13;
households. Other indicators that render households vulnerable to poverty include the size&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                vi&#13;
&amp;#12;of the household and the level of education of the head of household. Beyond general&#13;
poverty levels, food insecurity is a critical aspect of vulnerability. Lack of access to&#13;
education, health and other basic services is another source of vulnerability. The population&#13;
group most vulnerable is children, with stubbornly high levels of malnutrition in the&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Given the specific poverty and vulnerability profile of Togo, social protection policies and&#13;
programs will need to take into consideration several factors. Togo will continue to be&#13;
affected by shocks that affect a significant portion of the population so social protection&#13;
programs will need to be scalable and responsive to shocks. Social protection programs will&#13;
need to address some of the more structural issues of poverty and not just seek to satisfy&#13;
todayâ&#128;&#153;s needs. For example, social protection programs should seek to break the&#13;
intergenerational transmission of poverty by promoting access to basic services like health&#13;
and education and developing local infrastructure. Importance of the informal sector poses&#13;
a challenge to extending more traditional social security. Targeting mechanisms will need to&#13;
be tailored to country circumstance. With such high levels of poverty, full coverage of&#13;
targeted programs will require significant resources and there will be budgetary trade-offs&#13;
between stabilizing the deficits in contributory social protection programs while expanding&#13;
non-contributory programs to the poorest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of the Current Situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is no specific national social protection policy or strategy, but many of the&#13;
Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s overall policy directives are relevant to social protection. For example, the&#13;
Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 2009-2011 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) acknowledges the need&#13;
for effective social protection measures to address the needs of vulnerable populations and&#13;
protect the general public against social risk of all types.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                vii&#13;
&amp;#12;Given the multi-faceted nature of social protection, there is a multiplicity of institutions&#13;
involved in the financing and implementation of social protection in Togo. This includes&#13;
public sector ministries and agencies as well as NGOs who have operational activities in&#13;
support of vulnerable groups and humanitarian assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Safety net programs in Togo have historically focused on emergency interventions, but&#13;
increasingly include a broader array of programs. Types of safety net interventions include:&#13;
in-kind transfers (school feeding, nutrition supplements, food aid, etc.), cash transfers,&#13;
temporary employment through labor intensive public works, and waivers for services (free&#13;
cesarean sections or school fee waivers). In-kind transfers of food are the most common&#13;
type of safety net in Togo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Most safety net programs target highly vulnerable groups. Coverage is limited at present,&#13;
with the exception of universal programs like fee waivers for primary education. As a result,&#13;
total expenditures on safety nets are quite low as a share of the national budget, as a share&#13;
of GDP and compared with expenditure levels in other African countries. More spending&#13;
goes to reactive, coping responses than preventative measures. About half of the total&#13;
amount spent on safety nets was for emergency in-kind distribution in the face of shocks.&#13;
There is a trade-off between coverage and intensity. The larger-scale programs of&#13;
nutritional support including grain stocks reach, potentially, a large number of people but&#13;
the benefit they deliver per person is very slight. In addition, targeting systems need to be&#13;
strengthened in some programs. For example, the fee waiver for indigents in the health&#13;
system does not have a systematic identification and screening tool nor consistent&#13;
application across regions and health centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Contributory social insurance programs include agencies that cover old age pensions,&#13;
disability, family allocations and health insurance to workers in the public and formal&#13;
private sectors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               viii&#13;
&amp;#12;   a) The â&#128;&#156;Caisse de Retraite du Togoâ&#128;&#157; (CRT) provides pensions, disability, survivor&#13;
       pensions, and family allocations to the public sector. The contributory system is&#13;
       based on civil servant contributions of 7 percent of base salaries and employer&#13;
       (State) contribution of 20 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   b) the â&#128;&#156;Caisse Nationale de SÃ©curitÃ© Socialeâ&#128;&#157; (CNSS) provides coverage to private sector&#13;
       employees and other categories of Government-employed staff. The contributory&#13;
       system is based on 4 percent from salaried workers and 16.5 percent from the&#13;
       employer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   c) Recently created in 2011, national institute for health insurance (â&#128;&#156;Institute National&#13;
       dâ&#128;&#153;Assurance Maladieâ&#128;&#157; -INAM) provides health insurance coverage for the public&#13;
       sector, including the central administration, local collectivities, para-public agencies,&#13;
       and retired public sector workers. The financing base of INAM is 7 percent of the&#13;
       base salary, paid in equal amounts by the employee and the employer (State).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Only a small percentage of the population is covered by formal social security and health&#13;
insurance mechanisms. Only five percent of adults participate in formal social security&#13;
schemes. An estimated 6 percent of the population is covered by some type of health&#13;
insurance, of which 4 percent is under the INAM regime. Nonetheless, public spending on&#13;
contributory pensions is the largest area of social protection spending. Annual public&#13;
spending from the State as employer totals about 1 percent of GDP. The bulk of this is for&#13;
CRT pension payments. However, both the CRT and CRSS are facing long-run structural&#13;
funding deficits that need to be addressed if they are to be sustainable. In recent years, the&#13;
CRT has often delayed pension payments and accumulated significant arrears. The fiduciary&#13;
management of CRT and CNSS has created concerns among their pensioners about the&#13;
reliability and credibility of the social insurance system. Moreover, actuarial analysis reveals&#13;
that financial imbalances are only expected to worsen, putting future pensioners at risk. In&#13;
terms of health insurance issues, it will be important to further develop INAM within a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               ix&#13;
&amp;#12;coherent national health care strategy, integrating the supply and financing of services with&#13;
contributory and non-contributory solidarity mechanisms. This will require placing INAM&#13;
within sectoral strategies and priority programs. The relationship of INAM to the mutual&#13;
health insurance schemes will need to be considered, particularly with the idea of&#13;
expanding INAM beyond the public sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social protection-related interventions in labor market and employment issues are largely&#13;
oriented to the protection of vulnerable workers and the promotion of access to&#13;
employment of specific vulnerable groups likely to be excluded from the labor market. In&#13;
the context of current activities in Togo this includes several active labor market programs&#13;
oriented to improving employability and future employment prospects for targeted groups&#13;
and the strengthening of labor standards and regulations to protect workers from&#13;
workplace hazards. Active labor market programs are relatively small in scale, with several&#13;
pilots initiated recently focusing on youth employment. Targeting these programs to those&#13;
in greatest need is a challenge. For example, PRONOVAT and AIDE draw from a pool that is&#13;
not very representative of the poorer populations â&#128;&#147; youth with diplomas. Costs per&#13;
beneficiary range are relatively high. As most approaches are in their pilot stage, there&#13;
needs to be a sufficient evaluation base to justify scaling up such programs. Even if these&#13;
approaches work and can be scaled up, there are large gaps in reaching certain target&#13;
groups. For example, existing programs target either formal sector employment or rural&#13;
areas, leaving a significant gap on support to the urban informal sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Towards a National Social Protection Policy and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The goal of a national social protection policy is to reduce poverty, improve living conditions&#13;
and promote broad-based economic growth by building an inclusive and reliable national&#13;
social protection system. A national social protection policy and strategy is an important&#13;
foundation to orienting the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s future actions in the area of social protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               x&#13;
&amp;#12;The Government has identified the general objective for social protection as : Â« to protect&#13;
the Togolese population against vulnerabilities and social risks Â». A core set of specific&#13;
social protection objectives that would respond to the current needs of Togo could include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Objective #1: Develop and extend a reliable and financially sustainable&#13;
contributory social insurance system that addresses the risks of old age, death and&#13;
disability to all households able to participate. This would entail carrying out parametric&#13;
reforms that address the structural deficits and future financial sustainability of the CRT and&#13;
CNSS to ensure that retirees are protected and the drain on public finances is minimized, as&#13;
well as Separate the risks of old age, death and disability managed by the CRT from other&#13;
employment benefits provided by the State to its employees. Institutional reforms of CRT&#13;
and CNSS are necessary to improve the institutional functioning and governance of the&#13;
social insurance system. The strategy would also seek to extend contributory social security&#13;
mechanisms to the informal sector, agricultural cooperatives and independent workers to&#13;
reach a more vulnerable population with social insurance mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Objective #2: Ensure access to health services, improve health outcomes and&#13;
mitigate the adverse effects of health shocks by developing contributory mechanisms of&#13;
health insurance. This would be achieved by continuing the implementation of INAM to&#13;
ensure that it can fulfill its immediate mandate, investigating mechanisms to address the&#13;
â&#128;&#152;missing middleâ&#128;&#153; between coverage for salaried workers and support for indigent patients,&#13;
and developing technical options to reach universal coverage of health insurance in the&#13;
medium to long term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Objective #3: Prevent destitution and build human capital of the most vulnerable&#13;
through an integrated system of safety net interventions that address the needs of the&#13;
chronic poor, those affected by shocks and the needs of specific vulnerable groups . Specific&#13;
actions would seek to put in place cash transfer programs and labor intensive public works&#13;
programs to reinforce the capacity of the poorest and most vulnerable households and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xi&#13;
&amp;#12;prevent destitution. These along with other safety net interventions would seek to ensure&#13;
that the poorest and most vulnerable have access to health and education services and&#13;
would reduce the financial barriers to access of food security and ensure quality nutrition&#13;
for households with children in an effort to develop human capital and promote societal&#13;
equity. In addition, social protection measures are needed tailored to the needs of the most&#13;
vulnerable: orphans and victimized or exploited children, children in conflict with the law,&#13;
people affected by HIV/AIDS, the disabled, elderly and people affected by catastrophes. The&#13;
latter should complement disaster risk mitigation and response strategies with safety net&#13;
interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Objective #4: Promote employability and access to jobs and income and safe&#13;
working conditions among groups likely to be excluded from the labor market. The&#13;
strategy would seek to increase access to employment and income among long-term&#13;
unemployed and underemployed, with a focus on youth, women and the disabled, and to&#13;
create favorable conditions for decent work and the elimination of exploitation of&#13;
vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Translating the overall goals and principles of a national social protection policy into a&#13;
medium-term strategy should seek to: (i) build on the existing social protection efforts of&#13;
the Government; (ii) identify any key gaps for vulnerable groups which will require&#13;
developing new programs or approaches, (iii) be coherent with the nationâ&#128;&#153;s overall poverty&#13;
reduction strategy, as put forth in the national poverty reduction strategy, and (iv) be&#13;
supported by a legal framework (legislative and regulatory).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The overall objective of these interventions should be to develop a coherent and integrated&#13;
national social protection system. A systems approach reduces fragmentation, promotes&#13;
harmonization and can enhance both the performance of individual programs and the&#13;
overall functions of social protection in creating opportunities, providing resilience and&#13;
promoting equity. There are several aspects to developing a national social protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xii&#13;
&amp;#12;system that should be prioritized over the coming years, including developing a common set&#13;
of tools like targeting systems, beneficiary registries, common coordination, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation systems, and a medium-term expenditure framework. The system should&#13;
envision scalability and actively seek linkages between programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
An effective national social protection system will require a conducive institutional&#13;
framework. Building a supportive institutional framework at the central level should focus&#13;
on several key functions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a) Overall policy coherence&#13;
       b) Coordination of programming between elements of the national social&#13;
           protection strategy&#13;
       c) Coherence with the DSRP institutional framework&#13;
       d) Collaboration on policy and implementation mechanisms with other sectors, like&#13;
           health, education, and natural disaster management&#13;
       e) Linkages with budget formulation and monitoring mechanisms at the central&#13;
           level&#13;
       f) Collaboration with external partners, including international partners, NGOs and&#13;
           the private sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The success of implementing the national social protection strategy is supported through&#13;
effective monitoring and evaluation systems. Each social protection program typically&#13;
develops its own M &amp; E system. However, coordination between programs under a national&#13;
M &amp; E action plan can improve the quality and compatibility of information between&#13;
programs. While each program may have its more detailed set of indicators, a core set&#13;
should be developed to monitor the overall progress in implementing the national social&#13;
protection strategy. Impact evaluations will be an important element of the M &amp; E strategy.&#13;
A number of social protection programs are still in the early stages, where impacts are not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;yet known. Measuring changes in household status and wellbeing as a result of social&#13;
protection interventions helps justify funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Achieving the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s vision of social protection for all will require a significant&#13;
increase in resources to social protection. Total expenditures on social protection are quite&#13;
low as a share of the national budget and as a share of GDP. For instance, excluding general&#13;
price subsidies, safety nets represent only 1.8 percent of the general expenditures of the&#13;
State, or 0.5 percent of GDP (average 2008-2010). International partners finance about&#13;
three-quarters of this amount.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Estimating the amount of resources needed depends on the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s prioritization of&#13;
the mix of interventions selected and their scale over the medium term. The Government&#13;
faces important trade-offs. Trying the reach all of the chronic and transitory poor,&#13;
representing 62 percent of the population will result in very low levels of the available&#13;
resources per capita, diluting effort and diminishing impact. Training more substantial&#13;
resources per beneficiary will necessarily mean developing targeting approaches that&#13;
discriminates between poor households. Resources are limited and in the short to medium-&#13;
term unlikely to be sufficient to cover all areas of SP fully. In particular, there are tensions&#13;
and trade-offs between policies supporting the contributory system as opposed to non-&#13;
contributory systems and safety nets, particularly if the contributory system requires large&#13;
infusions of public resources to stay afloat. The financial framework developed to&#13;
implement the national social protection strategy will need to take these tensions and&#13;
trade-offs into account and negotiate between the various societal groups affected to&#13;
create a social and political compact that allows for the protection of vulnerable groups in&#13;
Togo.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;I.        Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.        Over the last several years, the Government of Togo has made important advances&#13;
in the area of social protection. Although Togo has had limited social insurance and social&#13;
assistance programs, the economic shock and natural disasters starting in 2008 brought the&#13;
need for better mechanisms of social protection to the fore. The Government response has&#13;
focused on measures to address the needs of the affected populations, while building the&#13;
analytical base for developing a national social protection policy and strategy. For example,&#13;
several important social protection programs were launched in the last few years, including&#13;
the National Institute for Health Insurance, a labor intensive public works program for rural&#13;
areas, a school lunch program, and a pilot for cash transfer program targeting vulnerable&#13;
children. The Government has also promoted access to basic services by the poor by&#13;
eliminating school fees and fees for cesarean sections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.        As part of developing the analytical base for a national social protection policy and&#13;
strategy, a series of studies and analyses were carried out over the last two years.&#13;
International development partners have supported this effort and have worked closely&#13;
with the Government in developing this basis. A list of the available analyses of social&#13;
protection-related issues is presented in Table 1. This includes detailed reviews of the main&#13;
elements of Togoâ&#128;&#153;s contributory social insurance program, the nationâ&#128;&#153;s safety nets and the&#13;
targeted social assistance provided to children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.        This report forms part of the overall packet of analytical work prepared to support&#13;
the formation of a national social protection policy and strategy. The objectives of this&#13;
report are to:&#13;
     a.   Synthesize the situational analysis on poverty and vulnerability and the current&#13;
          state of social protection policies and programs from the set of background&#13;
          documents in Table 1.&#13;

&amp;#12;     b.   Assist the Government through providing general orientations and strategic choices&#13;
          in developing a national social protection policy and strategy that would integrate&#13;
          the various ongoing efforts and components of social protection with a view to&#13;
          achieving the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s longer-term goal of social protection for all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.        This report is organized in the following sections:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     a.   Section II provides a brief overview of the objectives, components and importance&#13;
          of social protection as part a countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth and poverty reduction&#13;
          objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     b.   Section III summarizes the basic situation of poverty and vulnerability in Togo and&#13;
          identifies vulnerable groups and main risks and shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     c.   Section IV analyses the current policy and institutional framework and reviews the&#13;
          main areas of social protection, in terms of approach, coverage, targeting and&#13;
          expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     d.   Section V proposes basic elements for the Government to take into consideration in&#13;
          developing a national social protection policy and strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     e.   Section VI identifies next steps in finalizing the preparation of a national social&#13;
          protection policy and strategy.&#13;

&amp;#12;II.    The Importance of Social Protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What is Social Protection?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.     Social protection encompasses a broad array of instruments that assist households&#13;
to prevent, mitigate and cop with various risks and shocks. There is no standardized&#13;
definition, but there is a consensus on its basic aspects:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Social protection is defined as a set of policies and programs designed to reduce&#13;
vulnerability to risks and improve the capacity to respond to shocks and loss of income&#13;
which expose households to poverty and destitution.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.     Social protection is an area of public policy that has grown in interest over the last&#13;
twenty years in terms of its application in developing countries . Dialogue and debate on&#13;
social protection has continued to expand, particularly in response to the food, fuel, and&#13;
financial crisis of 2008. Social protection is now regarded among policymakers as a key&#13;
component of poverty reduction strategies in the Africa region. Governments are investing&#13;
in social protection programs that are proving to be effective, and lessons from the design&#13;
and implementation of these programs are now informing the expansion of social&#13;
protection across the continent. However, while spending on social protection is increasing,&#13;
overall levels of both spending and coverage remain low except in some middle-income&#13;
countries. These low levels of coverage stand in stark contrast with the widespread nature&#13;
of poverty in Africa. The challenge in the coming years will be to develop national social&#13;
protection strategies and programs that provide for scaling up social protection as a major&#13;
component of managing risks and reducing poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.     The general objectives of social protection are to: (a) promote inclusion via access to&#13;
basic services (health, education, etc.) and to employment and revenue; (b) mitigate the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               5&#13;
&amp;#12;impacts of shocks and life-changing events on the well-being of households; and (c) assure&#13;
a minimum of consumption in order to avoid destitution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.     There are several main social protection instruments that may vary by country&#13;
context:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a) Safety nets&#13;
       b) Social insurance programs&#13;
       c) Labor market and employment programs&#13;
       d) Targeted service delivery to the poorest/most vulnerable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.     Safety nets are non-contributory transfer programs targeted to the poor and those&#13;
vulnerable to shocks. Types of safety net interventions include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       -   cash transfers (conditional or unconditional)&#13;
       -   In-kind transfers like school feeding, nutrition supplements, food aid&#13;
       -   Creation of temporary employment through labor intensive public works&#13;
       -   Fee waivers for services (like free health care or school fee waivers&#13;
       -   Price subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.    The specific objectives of safety nets are to support directly the consumption of the&#13;
poor and vulnerable, to guarantee access of excluded groups and households to essential&#13;
social services, to provide temporary support to population affected by shocks, and to&#13;
break the cycle of poverty transmission between generations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.    The effective implementation of safety nets requires that they provide predictable&#13;
support that households can count on rather than ad-hoc support. It is important to note&#13;
that the impacts of safety nets extend beyond the immediate protection of household well-&#13;
being, but also enable households to protect and accumulate assets and to develop human&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;capital necessary to move out of poverty over the longer term. Safety nets need to be&#13;
scaled up in times of need to have a significant impact on reducing vulnerability. And, safety&#13;
nets need to be well integrated with sectoral policies, for example coordinating the impact&#13;
on schools and health centers of expanded access provided through safety nets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12.    Social insurance encompasses contributory risk-pooling programs designed to&#13;
protect the well-being of households and businesses in the face of old age, illness, accidents&#13;
and other shocks that can translate into poverty. Types of social insurance include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       -   Pensions systems for seniors.&#13;
       -   Health insurance, whether market-based, publically-funded or community-&#13;
           based.&#13;
       -   Crop insurance.&#13;
       -   Unemployment and disability insurance, which are classic elements of social&#13;
           security.&#13;
       -   Micro-insurance products, like life insurance or property insurance, typically&#13;
           provided through microfinance institutions in order to reach the informal sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13.    The specific objectives of social insurance are to protect the assets and income of&#13;
affected populations, to ensure access to services and to smooth consumption in the face&#13;
of adverse events.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.    To be successful, pension programs and other forms of social insurance must be&#13;
financially self-sustaining, based on appropriate parameters regarding premiums, risks&#13;
covered, eligible beneficiaries, and benefit levels. Public social insurance programs not built&#13;
on a solid financial risk becoming a serious fiscal drain on the state budget and may crowd&#13;
out other expenditures to protect vulnerable groups. Contributory social insurance&#13;
programs require transparent and effective governance to establish sufficient confidence&#13;
for those paying into the system. One of the challenges of contributory insurance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               7&#13;
&amp;#12;mechanisms is the high poverty levels making it difficult for much of the population to&#13;
participate in contributory schemes as well as the large share of the informal sector, where&#13;
traditional social insurance mechanisms are poorly adapted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15.    Labor programs and policies promote employment and productivity, particularly&#13;
among youth and other groups likely to be excluded from the labor market. Labor and&#13;
employment programs with social protection aspects include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       -   labor market regulations (wage laws, worker protections)&#13;
       -   initiatives to enhance the skills of the workforce likely to be the most excluded&#13;
           from participation or those having been retrenched from certain industries and&#13;
           sectors&#13;
       -   active job-seeking services including counseling and placement&#13;
       -   wage and employment subsidies&#13;
       -   on the job training and internships&#13;
       -   income generating programs to develop businesses among the poor and&#13;
           vulnerable&#13;
       -   programs to eliminate dangerous and exploitative work, particularly among&#13;
           children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16.    The specific objectives of social protection-oriented labor market programs are to&#13;
increase the employability, the access to work and the income levels of targeted&#13;
populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17.    The challenges of designing and implementing successful labor market interventions&#13;
include adapting approaches that work in the formal sector to the vast majority of targeted&#13;
population in the informal sector and in the rural economy. Active labor market programs&#13;
in the African context are also constrained by limited information on which programs&#13;
actually works and deliver results, with a dearth of impact evaluations done on the handful&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              8&#13;
&amp;#12;of scaled-up programs in the African context. Moreover, scaling-up programs to a level&#13;
sufficient to have an impact at the national level is constrained by financing and&#13;
institutional capacity in both the public and private sectors to absorb large numbers of&#13;
trainees and other job seekers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18.    Targeted service delivery programs are defined as complementary efforts to&#13;
improve the supply of services in underserved communities. This is particularly applicable in&#13;
those African countries where the supply side of public services has a difficult time making&#13;
sure that services are available in the poorest communities. In those situations,&#13;
compensatory, targeted service delivery programs such as social funds, decentralized&#13;
service delivery programs and targeted support to vulnerable groups can provide a&#13;
necessary component to national social protection strategies. Of course, increasing funding&#13;
to basic services may similarly increase the access of poor and vulnerable groups. However,&#13;
the main difference between an SP-oriented approach and a sector-wide approach is that&#13;
one has this as an explicit objective whereas the general sectoral program may not.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.    Types of targeted service delivery programs include: (i) Social and community&#13;
investment funds for basic infrastructure and (ii) decentralization of basic service programs&#13;
targeted to the poorest communities. The specific objectives of these targeted service&#13;
delivery programs are to ensure access to services, to develop local social and economic&#13;
infrastructure, and to promote human capital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20.    The challenges of effectively implementing these programs within a national social&#13;
protection strategy are to integrate their activities with sectoral programs and&#13;
decentralization initiatives. Such programs should seek to develop a package of services to&#13;
be made available in the poorest communities. Utilizing community-based approaches can&#13;
amplify impacts through strengthening the capacities of poor communities to identify and&#13;
implement service delivery projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              9&#13;
&amp;#12;21.    The Government of Togo has commented that its programs to provide services to&#13;
underserved communities are not considered directly part of social protection as the nation&#13;
classifies social protection. In addition, it has not formed part of the background reviews of&#13;
the sector. As such, this report does not specifically include this potential area of social&#13;
protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Who is targeted by public social protection interventions?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.    One of the most salient features of social protection programs are their targeted&#13;
nature, seeking to deliver benefits to specific at-risk populations. Social protection&#13;
programs may apply equally to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a) The chronic poor, as even in good times these households are poor and require&#13;
           assistance to meet their minimum needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       b) Individuals or households vulnerable to life events or shocks that might reduce&#13;
           their wellbeing, including economic crises, natural disasters, illness or old age.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       c) Those with special circumstances, including people with disabilities, orphans and&#13;
           street children who may require integrated and specialized services to address&#13;
           their needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               10&#13;
&amp;#12;Rationale for investing in social protection1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23.      Social protection reduces poverty and contributes to sustainable, inclusive growth&#13;
through three functions â&#128;&#147; equity, resilience, and opportunity (Figure 1):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    a)   Resilience reduces the likelihood that adverse shocks will have negative&#13;
         consequences for individuals and households, thereby preventing them from falling&#13;
         into poverty. This is largely achieved through social insurance mechanisms such as&#13;
         unemployment and disability insurance and by supporting poor individuals to access&#13;
         markets for, among others, weather-based insurance that aim to minimize the loss&#13;
         suffered by households that have experienced a shock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    b)   Equity aims to guarantee individuals and households a minimum level of well-being&#13;
         and can reduce the socioeconomic harm that results from acute inequality. This&#13;
         helps promote equity, by protecting poor individuals and families from irreversible&#13;
         and catastrophic losses of human capital, and contributes to laying the foundation&#13;
         for equality of opportunity, notably by helping families feel secure enough to invest&#13;
         in their and their childrenâ&#128;&#153;s future. These initiatives include safety nets (such as cash&#13;
         transfers and public works), social pensions, school feeding, and other efforts to&#13;
         extend access to basic services to the poorest.&#13;

                                    shocks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 c)      Opportunity aims to enable men and women to pursue productive livelihoods. This&#13;
         can be done by building their skills and promoting their employability, investing in&#13;
         their human and physical capital (and that of their children), and enabling individuals&#13;
         to take make more innovative and productiveâ&#128;&#148;but riskierâ&#128;&#148;investments. These&#13;
         instruments can include labor market programs, targeted service delivery projects,&#13;
         cash transfers, and the infrastructure resulting from public works programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24.      Social protection interventions produce improvements in household outcomes by:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a) Reducing household poverty and vulnerability. Improvements in consumption, income&#13;
      and food security have been observed in social protection programs, such as cash&#13;
      transfers, public works, and non-contributory (or â&#128;&#156;socialâ&#128;&#157;) pensions which provide poor&#13;
      households with resources to meet their basic consumption. This can reduce the extent&#13;
      to which they need to resort to negative coping responses such as reducing their food&#13;
      consumption, selling their productive assets, pulling their children out of school, or&#13;
      foregoing medical care, all of which have the effect of keeping the household in a&#13;
      longer-term poverty trap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    12&#13;
&amp;#12;b) Improving health, nutrition and education outcomes. Pensions, cash transfers, in-kind&#13;
      transfers and social insurance programs have all shown to improve human development&#13;
      outcomes in the African context. This includes better weightâ&#128;&#147;for-height indicators&#13;
      (through social pensions in South Africa), higher school enrollment rates and lower HIV&#13;
      prevalence (through cash transfers to girls in Malawi), and expanded use of health&#13;
      services and better health indicators (as evidenced in Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s national commu nity-&#13;
      based health insurance).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
c) Building productive assets and expanding income-earning and employment&#13;
      opportunities. To the extent that social protection interventions can help the poor to&#13;
      accumulate tangible productive assets and not just cover their current consumption,&#13;
      their growth prospects are enhanced. Social protection programs also give workers a&#13;
      chance to gain experience and thus help them to build a skill set. Social funds and the&#13;
      decentralization of service delivery expand access to economic and social infrastructure&#13;
      and services and build community-level assets. Instruments to mitigate risks can also&#13;
      translate into greater agricultural productivity, the creation of new businesses, or the&#13;
      expansion of economic activity. Improved employment outcomes have been observed&#13;
      in programs that provide training to youths, for example in Northern Uganda where&#13;
      community-based youth employment interventions led to almost 75 percent of&#13;
      participating you engaged in skilled work two years after the training and business start-&#13;
      up assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.      While social protection can make a significant contribution to these household-&#13;
level outcomes, it does not act in isolation. Social protection measures can help&#13;
households improve health and education outcomes, for example. But, there are many&#13;
other non-social protection programs that contribute to these broad societal objectives,&#13;
including provision of schools and health centers and clean water. Social protection can&#13;
contribute to greater employability, but investments in private sector development and&#13;
economic infrastructure are necessary to ensure that the economy in general is capable to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                13&#13;
&amp;#12;generating productive employment opportunities. Figure 2 illustrates how social&#13;
protection interventions fit into these broader development objectives.&#13;

Links to overall economic growth and increased productivity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.    Social protection is increasingly considered important for its direct linkage to&#13;
economic growth and household productivity. While the significant impact of social&#13;
protection on household well-being is now widely recognized, there is a growing&#13;
understanding that social protection should be considered more than a â&#128;&#152;hand-outâ&#128;&#153;, but as&#13;
an investment with impacts on economic growth and productivity at the micro-, meso- and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             14&#13;
&amp;#12;macro levels. At the micro level, the accumulation of assets, skills and the provision of&#13;
insurance to allow households to take on greater investment risk all contribute to greater&#13;
productivity. At the meso-level, social protection contributes to building local economies by&#13;
creating infrastructure, stimulating local markets, and improving labor market functioning.&#13;
At the macro-economic level, social protection contributes to broad economic growth by&#13;
stimulating aggregate demand, for example through countercyclical spending on safety&#13;
nets, by facilitating difficult economic reforms, for example by addressing worker&#13;
retrenchments, and by replacing economic-growth reducing policies like general price&#13;
subsidies with growth enhancing, targeted support to affected households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;III.   Poverty and Vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.    The development of social protection policies and programs need to be based on&#13;
the specific profile of risks and vulnerabilities in Togo. There is no one-size-fits all social&#13;
protection policy or strategy. Social protection policies need to be constructed that identify&#13;
the vulnerable populations and link social protection interventions to the specific risks faced&#13;
by Togolese. This section reviews the poverty profile of Togo, identifies key risks and shocks&#13;
and draws the implications for social protection policies of the poverty and vulnerability&#13;
situation of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Poverty Profile&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.    Although falling slightly over the last 5 years, poverty remains deeply entrenched&#13;
in Togo, with 3.6 million Togolese living below the poverty line out of a national&#13;
population of 6.2 million. The new data from the2011 QUIBB household survey show a&#13;
national poverty rate (percentage below the poverty line, Po) of 58.7 percent, down 3&#13;
percentage points from the poverty rate observed in 2006 (Table 2). Despite this general&#13;
reduction in both areas, poverty remains concentrated in the rural areas with 73 percent of&#13;
the rural population under the poverty line.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
29.      Although the poverty rate has declined, inequality and the severity of poverty&#13;
among the poor has worsened slightly. Poverty is deep, with a significant portion of the&#13;
population in extreme poverty and relatively high levels of income inequality. On average,&#13;
the poor have an expenditure shortfall of 24 percent of the poverty line, a situation that has&#13;
worsened by one percentage point since 2006. Equally, the poverty severity index has&#13;
eroded slightly, up to 13.1 from 11.6 in 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30.      By region, the decrease in poverty is concentrated in the south, specifically the&#13;
regions of Grand LomÃ© and Maritime. Among the other regions, only the Kara region saw a&#13;
reduction in poverty between 2006 and 2011. In particular, the two poorest regions in 2006&#13;
(Centrale and Savanes) experienced an increase in poverty. The poorest regions remain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   17&#13;
&amp;#12;those farthest from the coast. The poverty rate in the Savanes region increased from 87 to&#13;
91 percent over the course of the last five years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31.    Other household characteristics are associated with poverty. Poverty is higher&#13;
among households headed by someone over 55 years old compared to younger&#13;
households. The severity and depth of poverty decreases with the age of the head of&#13;
household. Other indicators that render households vulnerable to poverty include the size&#13;
of the household and the level of education of the head of household. The latter shows the&#13;
intergenerational transmission of poverty where poorer households where children had&#13;
more limited access to education result in higher poverty levels when these children&#13;
become adult heads of households.&#13;

&amp;#12;Vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
32.        Poverty is dynamic, with households moving in and out of poverty depending on&#13;
various conditions. The concept of vulnerability can be defined as the present probability&#13;
of remaining poor or of becoming poor in the future. Using data from the 2006 QUIBB, the&#13;
vulnerability rate was also calculated for Togo.3 The findings are that the overall&#13;
vulnerability rate is 81.8 percent, distributed among the long-term poor (39.6 percent), the&#13;
short-term poor (22.0 percent) and the vulnerable non-poor (20.2 percent). If this same&#13;
distribution (from 2006) applies to the 2010 total population, 1 million Togolese would be&#13;
considered non-poor, 1.2 million non-poor but vulnerable to poverty, 1.3 million short-term&#13;
poor and 2.3 million long-term poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
33.        Beyond general poverty levels, food insecurity is a critical aspect of vulnerability.&#13;
Overall, 71 percent of households live in a condition of food insecurity, rising to 88 percent&#13;
among poor households. Food insecurity is defined as the occurrence of food shortages, i.e.&#13;
not being able to procure sufficient food over the preceding months. Food insecurity is&#13;
affected by low incomes as well as low productivity subsistence agriculture and frequent&#13;
weather-related shocks (floods, droughts).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
34.        Lack of access to education, health and other basic services is another source of&#13;
vulnerability. This lack of access can be due to several factors, from the lack infrastructure&#13;
within reasonable distance â&#128;&#147; typical of rural areas â&#128;&#147; to lack of money to pay for the services&#13;
and associated costs or high perceived opportunity costs of sending children to school&#13;
versus working on the family farm and other businesses. According to the MICS 2010&#13;
survey, births attended by trained health personnel were two times lower in rural (43.6&#13;
percent) than in urban areas (91.1 percent). Births taking place in a health center were also&#13;
less likely in rural areas (53.8 percent) versus urban areas (91.9 percent). In terms of&#13;

                                                        19&#13;
&amp;#12;education, despite advances in enrollment, the net enrollment rate is lower in rural areas&#13;
(86 percent) than in urban areas (94 percent), though there is parity between boys and girls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
35.    The population group most vulnerable to poverty is children. The high level of food&#13;
insecurity translates into alarming levels of child malnutrition. The results of the MISC 2010&#13;
survey indicate that three out of ten children (29.5 percent) show low weight for age&#13;
(where the ratio weight for age is at least two standard deviations from the median). The&#13;
percentage of malnourished children was higher in the rural areas (35.4 percent) than in the&#13;
urban areas (17.8 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36.    Child labor is one of the most decisive factors in their vulnerability to poverty . The&#13;
2010 survey on child labor in Togo found that 55 percent of children between 5 -14 years&#13;
old are engaged in work. There are wide regional disparities, with only 19 percent of 5-17&#13;
year olds in Lome engaged in work versus 73 percent in the Savanes region.4 The regions of&#13;
Plateaux, Centrale and Maritime have the highest levels of child laborers between 12 -14&#13;
years old. Overall, of those children engaged in work, about half are in the basic production&#13;
areas of agriculture/fishing/animal husbandry and one-quarter in domestic work. Economic&#13;
imperatives drive this level of child labor, whether to help out with the family business or&#13;
provide additional revenue to the family. The vulnerability of children is further exacerbated&#13;
by a lack of access to basic social services (health and education) particularly in poorer&#13;
communities, as well as by practices such as migration or child trafficking and exploitative&#13;
child labor resulting from householdsâ&#128;&#153; strategic survival choices. Children living with a&#13;
mother with no formal instruction are particularly vulnerable, with higher rates of child&#13;
mortality and malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               20&#13;
&amp;#12;37.      Other vulnerable groups face particular challenges:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      a) Having a disability is linked with higher poverty rates. For example, in LomÃ©, a&#13;
         household with a disabled head is 17 percent more likely to be poor than a&#13;
         household with an able-bodied head.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      b) In 2009, UNAIDS estimated that approximately 120,000 Togolese were living with&#13;
         HIV/AIDS, 62 percent of whom were women. There are about 66,000 orphans due&#13;
         to AIDS between the ages of 0-16. Increased health costs, reduced productivity and&#13;
         the effects on families of AIDS-related deaths makes these households particularly&#13;
         vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      c) Orphans and children separated from their biological parents are vulnerable to&#13;
         neglect and exploitation. In Togo, school enrollment rates for children ages 10-14&#13;
         years who have lost their two parents is 76.1 percent compared to 89.2 percent for&#13;
         non-orphan children, or a difference of 13.1 percentage points.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      d) In terms of early marriage for girls, the percentage of women aged 20-49 years who&#13;
         were married or in union with a man before the age of 18 was about 29 percent for&#13;
         the country (MICS 4 2010). Early marriage of girls is almost twice as widespread in&#13;
         rural areas (36.5 percent) than in urban areas (19.3 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      e) Human trafficking affecting vulnerable groups, especially young women and&#13;
         children, has historically been a serious problem.&#13;
&#13;
Main risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
38.      There are a broad range of risks that households face that can put them in a&#13;
situation of vulnerability. As social protection aims at managing risk, the key step toward a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               21&#13;
&amp;#12;social protection strategy is identifying the risks to which the Togolese are exposed. Risks&#13;
can be classified into idiosyncratic risks that affect a specific individual or household due to&#13;
that householdâ&#128;&#153;s characteristics and covariate shocks that affect a broad class of people&#13;
either due to their geographical location or area of economic activity for instance. Table 3&#13;
lists examples of these types of shocks facing Togolese. Disease and old age, for example,&#13;
are individual risks that can have catastrophic effects on a person's wellbeing.&#13;
Environmental degradation and natural disasters as well as macroeconomic shocks are key&#13;
covariate risks, affecting large segments of the population.&#13;
&#13;

  Unemployment                         Macroeconomic shocks&#13;
  Old age                              Political unrest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
39.      Risk factors that exacerbate vulnerability in the face of shocks include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      a) Household-level risk factors relate to household structure and composition, and to&#13;
         its socioeconomic characteristics. High dependency ratios, low social standing,&#13;
         limited access to means of production and low or uncertain returns to labor are&#13;
         typical household risk factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      b) Community risk factors are primarily determined by ecological and infrastructural&#13;
         conditions. Massive soil degradation, especially in overpopulated areas of the&#13;
         Savanes, Kara and Maritime regions, is probably the greatest ecological risk, as it&#13;
         lowers the productivity of entire villages. Land degradation affects at least 85&#13;
         percent of arable land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               22&#13;
&amp;#12;      c) National risk factors have to do with geographical and political conditions, as well as&#13;
         with laws and policies. They affect the whole population, but tend to be more&#13;
         burdensome on the lowest socio-economic strata.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40.      Togo has experienced several broad-scale shocks in recent years that have had&#13;
significant effects on the population. Natural disasters, and in particular recurring flooding&#13;
in recent years, have been particularly devastating, resulting in the loss of human life,&#13;
infrastructure destruction, and damage to the Togolese economy. There were major floods&#13;
in Togo during the last four years. For example, in 2008, approximately 12,000 hectares of&#13;
cultivated land were washed away by the floods and road, bridge and school infrastructure&#13;
were destroyed. Many farmers lost significant portions of their annual income and there&#13;
were local food shortages. The national economy was affected through increased&#13;
transportation costs and loss of Government revenues. In October 2010, 83,000 people&#13;
were affected by floods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
41.      Togoâ&#128;&#153;s macroeconomic vulnerability is high given its openness to the world&#13;
market, as witnessed in the international price shocks and general global economic&#13;
downturn that affected the country starting in 2007 - 2008. Rising food and fuel prices and&#13;
contagion from the global recession impacted populations in several ways. At the macro&#13;
level, the gross level of activity of Togolese enterprises was negatively impacted by the&#13;
global economic recession. There was a significant reduction in public spending on health,&#13;
education and agriculture â&#128;&#147; the sectors that most benefit the poor â&#128;&#147; in 2010 in the&#13;
aftermath of the economic downturn. In terms of micro-level impacts on households,&#13;
increases in food prices had a direct impact on household poverty levels. Fuel price&#13;
increases directly affected householdsâ&#128;&#153; transportation and energy cost with indirect costs of&#13;
dampening economic activity and raising the costs of transported goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
42.      The effects were very different between rural and urban areas. In rural areas, rising&#13;
food prices in fact benefited rural producers, dampening the poverty increasing impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                23&#13;
&amp;#12;Urban consumers were hardest hit. While 71 percent of the urban population was&#13;
vulnerable in 2006, this proportion grew to 79 percent after the international price shocks.&#13;
Simulations estimate that the poverty rate in Lome would have increased by 2 percent&#13;
while the poverty rate in Savanes would have decreased by 2 percent. Overall, 52 percent of&#13;
households would have remained in the same poverty decile, while 21 percent would have&#13;
migrated to a higher decile and 28 percent towards a lower (poorer) decile.5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implications for social protection policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
43.     A national social protection strategy and interventions should reflect the general&#13;
profile of risks and vulnerabilities. Certain types of social protection interventions map to&#13;
different levels of poverty and vulnerability (Figure 4). For example, the population of the&#13;
non-poor (whether vulnerable or not) are the main target for the development of&#13;
contributory social insurance programs (like pensions and health insurance) because of the&#13;
ability to pay. In the case of Togo, this represents about 38 percent of the population, or 2.2&#13;
million people. Governments may choose to subsidize lower-income access to these&#13;
programs, but in those cases it is the government making the contribution on behalf of a&#13;
segment of its citizens. Safety net programs typically target the poor (61 percent of the&#13;
population or 3.6 million people), though they are often scaled up in the face of shocks. An&#13;
additional 1.2 million Togolese are in vulnerable to shocks and would need expanded safety&#13;
nets in the time of crises. The chronic poor, representing 2.3 million people, require&#13;
assistance to avoid destitution, food insecurity, malnutrition and host of other adverse&#13;
outcomes whether there are shocks or not. In many cases, such as with orphans and&#13;
vulnerable children or the disabled, safety nets should be linked to integrated programs&#13;
that address their specific needs.&#13;

&#13;
                                                   24&#13;
&amp;#12;44.      Given the specific poverty and vulnerability profile of Togo, social protection&#13;
policies and programs will need to take into consideration the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      a) Togo will continue to be affected by shocks that affect a significant portion of the&#13;
         population. Social protection programs will need to be scalable and responsive to&#13;
         shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      b) Social protection programs will need to address some of the more structural issues&#13;
         of poverty and not just seek to satisfy todayâ&#128;&#153;s needs. While the protective aspects&#13;
         of social protection are important, social protection programs should seek to break&#13;
         the intergenerational transmission of poverty, for example by promoting access to&#13;
         basic services like health and education which can be achieved through conditioning&#13;
         cash transfers, for instance. Developing local infrastructure, including environmental&#13;
         rehabilitation of degraded lands and soil and water conservation, are an important&#13;
         by-product of labor intensive public works programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      c) Targeting mechanisms will need to be tailored to country circumstance. For&#13;
         example, geographical targeting at the canton level using the new data available&#13;
         from the Census and QUIBB 2011 will allow for more fine-tuning below the regional&#13;
         level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      d) Importance of the informal sector poses a challenge to extending more traditional&#13;
         social security. Contributory social insurance is most easily applied to the formal&#13;
         sector of the economy. The large presence of informal sector and independent&#13;
         agricultural employment will challenge the Government to come up with alternative&#13;
         mechanisms to extend systems that are adapted to the needs and abilities of these&#13;
         groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               25&#13;
&amp;#12; e) There is a level of critical need that will require more targeted interventions. The&#13;
    high levels of malnutrition and food insecurity point to a subset of the poor that are&#13;
    in critical circumstances. Targeting mechanisms will need to identify not only the&#13;
    poor and vulnerable, but also the households within that that should receive priority&#13;
    interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 f) With such high levels of poverty, full coverage of targeted programs will require&#13;
    significant resources. Fully covering the poor with any program will mean covering&#13;
    the majority of the population. Strategic choices will need to be made to ensure that&#13;
    the combined package of social protection measures addresses the main risks and&#13;
    vulnerable populations within an overall realistic fiscal framework.&#13;

&amp;#12;g) The potential tension between contributory and non-contributory program will&#13;
   need to be managed in light of the fact that they both require budgetary support.&#13;
   Many of the current social insurance schemes are either financially unsustainable or&#13;
   already broke, and require public resources to stay alive. The tension on the&#13;
   allocation of limited fiscal resources is most often resolved to the advantage of the&#13;
   contributory schemes, potentially introducing even greater inequity into the social&#13;
   protection system.&#13;

&amp;#12;IV.        Social Protection in Togo â&#128;&#147; Analysis of the Current Situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    A.     The Overall Policy Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
45.        There is no specific national social protection policy or strategy, but many of the&#13;
Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s overall policy directives are relevant to social protection . However, social&#13;
protection is part of the larger poverty reduction strategies. In addition, several sectoral&#13;
strategies touch upon social protection issues, providing some level of policy guidance if not&#13;
an integrated view of social protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46.        Social protection has a place in Togoâ&#128;&#153;s overall poverty reduction strategy. The&#13;
Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 2009-2011 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)6 acknowledges the need&#13;
for effective social protection measures to address the needs of vulnerable populations and&#13;
protect the general public against social risk of all types. Under the PRSPâ&#128;&#153;s third pillar â&#128;&#147;&#13;
development of human capital â&#128;&#147; the strategy acknowledges a lack of effective coverage of&#13;
social protection programs, prioritizing the areas of (i) insurance; (ii) assistance and poverty&#13;
management; and (iii) safety and health in the workplace. The broad goal is to ensure, in&#13;
the medium term, a minimum of social protection for all citizens, men and women alike,&#13;
including all workers in the formal sector or the informal economy, whether wage-earners&#13;
or self-employed, urban or rural, industrial or agricultural, and for specific vulnerable&#13;
categories as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
47.        The PRSP acknowledges the lack of a strong program platform in social protection&#13;
at that time. There is limited coverage of social insurance programs, including social&#13;
security and health insurance. Social assistance programs are fragmented and lack clear&#13;
guidelines on concerning selection criteria and service packages. Worker safety issues are&#13;
not effectively addressed either within the legal framework or at an operational level. Given&#13;
this basis, the PRSP identifies priority actions in the areas of: i) expedite a study-assessment&#13;

    Togo: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2009-11).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        28&#13;
&amp;#12;to pin down the real situation in the area of social protection; (ii) perform a diagnostic audit&#13;
of current social protection service delivery organizations; (iii) develop a national policy on&#13;
social protection; (iv) raise the awareness of the Togolese population concerning the stakes&#13;
and the responsibilities incumbent upon them in ensuring the sustainability of any solutions&#13;
that are implemented; and (v) set in place an action plan to make the policy operational.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
48.      Other key areas of policy guidance relevant to social protection include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      a) The national education sectoral policy 2010-2020 which led to the elimination of&#13;
         school fees at the pre-primary and primary levels, accompanied by a subsidy of 2&#13;
         billion CFA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      b) The national health policy 2009-2013 which includes the development of different&#13;
         solidarity mechanisms to extend health insurance and access to health mutuals,&#13;
         better management of the subsidy for health services for indigents. Fees for&#13;
         caesarian sections were waived as of 2011.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      c) A national policy for the protection of children (2007/2008) focusing on children at&#13;
         risk due to being from a poor households, not registered at birth, excluded from the&#13;
         education system, in conflict with the law, disabled, and orphans, as well children&#13;
         being mistreated and neglected. A minimum packet of services for vulnerable&#13;
         children has been identified to improve coordination of service delivery to this highly&#13;
         vulnerable group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      d) The Framework Document for Employment Policy and the Fight Against Poverty was&#13;
         elaborated in 2004 with the objectives of increasing visibility of the labor market and&#13;
         employment issues, creating a legal and institutional environment conducive to&#13;
         productive employment, increasing access to credit systems for all sizes of&#13;
         businesses, improving the quality of employment training services, and creating and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               29&#13;
&amp;#12;         ensuring the functioning of various forms of social protection for different categories&#13;
         of workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      e) A national policy on gender equality including an action plan is under&#13;
         implementation, with a focus on reducing violence and exploitation of women as a&#13;
         part of addressing vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      f) A strategic plan for the management of natural disasters has been elaborated to&#13;
         better coordinate prevention and response to natural shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      g) Other sectoral policy areas are being developed but have not yet been approved&#13;
         (national employment policy, national policy for seniors, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.        Institutional Framework for Social Protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
49.      Given the multi-faceted nature of social protection, there is a multiplicity of&#13;
institutions involved in the financing and implementation of social protection in Togo .&#13;
This includes public sector ministries and agencies as well as NGOs who have operational&#13;
activities in support of vulnerable groups and humanitarian assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50.      At the national level, the following ministries all have a role to play, supported at&#13;
the operational level by their deconcentrated staff:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 -   Ministry of Work, Employment and Social Security.&#13;
                 -   Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity.&#13;
                 -   Ministry of Education.&#13;
                 -   Ministry of Health.&#13;
                 -   Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fishing.&#13;
                 -   Ministry of Finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                30&#13;
&amp;#12;                 -   Ministry of Planning.&#13;
                 -   Ministry of Community Development, Handicraft, Youth and Youth&#13;
                     Employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
51.     These agencies are involved in a variety of social protection instruments. There is a&#13;
multiplicity of programs, with many agencies engaged in more than one type of social&#13;
protection intervention (Table 4). At the operational level, the institutional dispersion is&#13;
greatest in the area of safety nets. Many types of safety net activities are spread across&#13;
many ministries making coordination on operational aspects, like targeting and beneficiary&#13;
selection, a challenge.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
52.     Coordination and harmonization between the various ministries and programs is&#13;
limited. At the national level, the PRSP coordinating structure provides for a sectoral&#13;
committee on social protection to follow-upon implementation of the PRSP. The Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     31&#13;
&amp;#12;Employment and Social Security is the lead structure for social protection in collaboration&#13;
with the Ministry of Social Action. They have coordinated a working group with the key&#13;
donors and other institutional actors to help develop diagnostics of the various aspects of&#13;
social protection and arrange trainings, seminars etc.&#13;
&#13;
C.     Analysis of the Current Situation with Safety Nets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overview of Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
53.    Safety net programs in Togo have historically focused on emergency interventions,&#13;
but increasingly include a broader array of programs. Types of safety net interventions&#13;
include: in-kind transfers (school feeding, nutrition supplements, food aid, etc.), cash&#13;
transfers (conditional or unconditional), temporary employment through labor intensive&#13;
public works, and waivers for services (like free health care or school fee waivers). General&#13;
price subsidies are often considered like a social safety net, however, as they are universal&#13;
programs often benefitting the better-off, they will be treated separately from overall&#13;
safety net expenditures. An overview of the range of safety net programs in effect is&#13;
presented in Table 5, including their institutional anchorage.&#13;

&#13;
54.        In-kind transfers of food are the most common type of safety net in Togo. These&#13;
programs typically target regions affected by emergencies, food insecurity, or where the&#13;
poorest reside in response to basic consumption difficulties. EU/Red Cross interventions&#13;
have been critical in responding to the floods of 2010. The MASSN provides punctual&#13;
support every year to those affected by natural disasters and to those in extreme need.&#13;
WFP orients its emergency support to the north of the country, targeting displaced persons&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
 The Community Development Project came into play with a strong social protection focus, with a focus on&#13;
imporving access to service delivery in targeted poor communities through a social fund mechanism rooted in&#13;
community demand. As integrated sectoral approaches were developed, in education in particular, the CDP&#13;
remains an important partner to line ministries in expanding access to services. At the same time, the CDP has&#13;
served as the institutional basis for key social protection interventions in response to crisis, like labor-intensive&#13;
public works, cash transfers and distribution of seeds and fertilizers to farmers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         33&#13;
&amp;#12;and communities affected by floods. UNICEF similarly has provided nutritional support to&#13;
affected populations, targeting families with malnourished children. The Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, through ANSAT, manages grain stocks (corn and rice) that are resold at&#13;
subsidized rates to the populations in the most vulnerable regions during critical moments&#13;
to attenuate the seasonal increases in grain prices in local markets. To avoid speculation,&#13;
purchases are regulated to a maximum amount.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
55.     In-kind food transfers also provide nutritional recuperation to the malnourished or&#13;
vulnerable to malnutrition. The main programs are carried out by MASSN, WFP and&#13;
UNICEF. They target people affected by HIV/AIDS and children at high risk for malnutrition.&#13;
Some of this nutritional support is channeled through the system of CRENAM ( Centres de&#13;
RÃ©habilitation Nutritionnelle Ambulatoire pour les Malnutris aigus ModÃ©rÃ©s), CRENI (Centres&#13;
de RÃ©habilitation Nutritionnelle Intensif) and CRENAS (Centres de RÃ©habilitation&#13;
Nutritionnelle Ambulatoire pour les Malnutris aigus SÃ©vÃ¨res), as well as community-based&#13;
approaches where the centers are not available. Nutritional support is also provided&#13;
through SOS Village dâ&#128;&#153;Enfants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
56.     School lunches were introduced/scaled up in response to the 2008-2009 economic&#13;
crisis as a means of responding to the food price increases as well as provide incentives&#13;
for school attendance. School lunches, supported by the World Bank and WFP, target the&#13;
most vulnerable rural geographic zones and within those, communities most affected by&#13;
floods and economic shocks. The World Bank-funded program reaches 92 schools and&#13;
works through local NGOs. The pilot reached over 21,000 students providing meals between&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
 In addition to the school lunches, the Community Development Project launched a 2.2 billion FCFA pilot in&#13;
response to the economic crises which involved purchasing 5,000 tons of fertilizer and significant quantities of&#13;
seeds that were distributed to 14,000 farmers, with a large subsidy component. Although this was a clear&#13;
response to the rising global food prices, with the aim of boosting production and eventually reducing costs of&#13;
food in Togo, the program targeted the most efficient producers as it was felt that by supporting this group,&#13;
often more entrepreneurial and better-off, there would be a larger production response. This program has not&#13;
been considered among the safety net programs that have been the subject of analysis of the 2011&#13;
background report â&#128;&#156;Â« Les Filets Sociaux au Togo Â» and so is not included in this section as it is viewed mainly&#13;
as an agricultural production program and not a safety net given its target population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      34&#13;
&amp;#12;60 and 70 percent of daily caloric intake needed for primary school age children at a unit&#13;
cost of about 31.000 CFCA per student. WFP supports a smaller program focusing on two&#13;
Communes du Millenaire. Despite the fact that the 2008â&#128;&#147;2009 school year had a general&#13;
increase in enrolment and attendance due to the government initiative of abolishing school&#13;
fees, school enrolment and attendance increased more significantly in schools with school&#13;
lunches, particularly among girls. Broader impacts found include average household savings&#13;
have of US$8â&#128;&#147;10 per month, employment and income opportunities for 600 mother-&#13;
helpers and economic effects of injected money into local economies for food purchases&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
57.    Labor-intensive public works as a safety net response were initiated in 2011 in&#13;
response to the need for temporary revenues and infrastructure improvements in the&#13;
poorest regions. Supported by the World Bank through the Community Development&#13;
Project, the program targets communities based on poverty, soil degradation, and&#13;
availability of laborers. Groups of 40 workers may work for up to 40 days, with a daily&#13;
payment of about 1.500 FCFA, with payments made directly to workers through the rural&#13;
banking and postal systems. By 2011, about 150 projects were completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58.    Cash transfers to households have not yet been used very extensively. The one&#13;
initiative identified by the Safety Nets Review was an NGO initiative (via WAO and Plan) to&#13;
intervene with cash payments to reduce child labor for those children obliged to leave&#13;
school. Transfers and access to loans are made the children/families to ensure that studies&#13;
are continued. However, these programs have been very micro in scale. A larger pilot of&#13;
cash transfers is set to begin in 2012 under the Second Community Development Project&#13;
through the MDABJEJ and funded by the World Bank. With a view to helping the&#13;
Government to develop its social protection policy and test a cash transfer mechanism, the&#13;
pilot targets children at risk of malnutrition or already severely malnourished in the&#13;
northern regions (Kara and Savanes). Cash transfers will complement an ongoing operation&#13;
financed by UNICEF that provides nutritional recuperation to severely malnourished&#13;
children and preventive services in 565 villages by providing monthly cash transfers to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              35&#13;
&amp;#12;childrenâ&#128;&#153;s mothers/caretakers as well as growth monitoring and training sessions for&#13;
caregivers (e.g., on health, hygiene and nutrition). The transfer will be 5,000 FCFA per&#13;
month per child aged 6-24 months for a maximum period of 18 months. Soft&#13;
conditionalities include having a birth certificate for the child, attending training and growth&#13;
monitoring sessions and schooling of older siblings; strong compliance will be rewarded&#13;
with extra cash.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
59.     Fee waiver programs in the health and education sectors help promote access to&#13;
and utilization of those services. In the health sector, there is a general policy for waiving or&#13;
reducing fees for people who cannot pay, carried out in cooperation between the Ministry&#13;
of Health and the MASSN. Management committees within health structures should&#13;
earmark 3 percent of their receipts for indigent cases. Social workers from the MASSN are&#13;
charged with screening those eligible and are supported to do field visits. In addition, there&#13;
is a budget transfer to the health establishments to reimburse for indigent expenses.&#13;
However, the criteria are not clear or consistent and there is no information system that&#13;
tracks the number of cases or verification mechanisms to support budget transfers. The&#13;
health sector has also instituted a fee waiver for all cesarean sections performed. However,&#13;
this only affects 15 hospitals, all in urban centers, most likely to affect better-off&#13;
populations.9 In terms of school fee waivers, these were established across the board,&#13;
benefitting all children who attend public primary (and pre-primary) school beginning in&#13;
2008-2009. Enrollments jumped 7 percent in 2009-2010.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
60.     Targeted services to vulnerable groups can also be considered part of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
safety net. Several of these are captured under in-kind support programs, however, their&#13;
support often goes far beyond in-kind transfers and entails more comprehensive services,&#13;
including counseling, institutional placement, legal assistance and follow-up to high risk&#13;
vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
 The fee waiver for cesarean sections is considered more of a health policy matter than a specific safety net&#13;
program and so was not included in the safety net review summarized in this section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      36&#13;
&amp;#12;a) The MASSN with Unicef and other NGO partners, carries out several activities oriented&#13;
      to protection of the rights of children. In 2009, the Green Line program was launched&#13;
      providing a free call-in number, Â« Allo 111 Â» staffed by social counselors for the&#13;
      reporting of various forms of violence, exploitation, abuse and mistreatment of children.&#13;
      In 2010, the green line received 150.000 calls and 380 denunciations. The program, has&#13;
      allowed for the identification of hundreds of vulnerable children to be referenced&#13;
      through the MASSN regional offices to services that can assist them. Where&#13;
      reintegration with families is not possible, children are placed with other services, like&#13;
      SOS Villages which provide a place for orphans, abandoned children and those in unsafe&#13;
      family situations and ensure that these vulnerable children have access to basic services&#13;
      and grow up in a supportive family environment. In addition, the MASSN provided&#13;
      support to over 4.000 families and 158 orphanages between 2008 and 2010.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
b) There are various supports provided to PVVIH. The MASSN offers assistance in food and&#13;
      pharmaceutical supplies, reaching 1.740 PVVIH/OEV in the 2008-2010 period. UNICEF&#13;
      supports a further 1.249 OEV and 85 families in the city of Dapaong.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
c) The disabled are a particularly vulnerable group, often fully reliant on family and&#13;
      informal support. The Direction of Disable Person at the MASSN provides punctual&#13;
      support to handicapped persons and organizations. Internationally funded initiatives&#13;
      and NGOs also provide some support. Approaches include both a center-based service&#13;
      delivery approach, for instance through the MASSNâ&#128;&#153;s training and professional&#13;
      reinsertion centers for disabled person, as well as through community-based re-&#13;
      adaptation programs that use a community development approach to create local&#13;
      partnerships and create a more inclusive environment for those with disabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
61.      Price subsidies are another form of spending to protect populations at times of&#13;
economic crisis that are often viewed as a type of safety net. Economic and natural&#13;
disasters hit the Togolese economy starting in 2008, totaling about 9% of GDP. In the face of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 37&#13;
&amp;#12;these shocks, the Government put in place price subsidies on electricity, petroleum&#13;
products and food products. These price shocks may have buffered populations from the&#13;
full impact of price shocks. However, they benefits tended to accrue to better off&#13;
populations, since they consume more electricity and petroleum products. The expense of&#13;
price subsidies for energy products in 2008-2010 represented 2.5 % of the national budget,&#13;
or about 6,220 milliards FCFA in 2010. Food subsidies represented about 3-5 percent actual&#13;
price reduction, so the impact on households was slight. Overall, recourse to subsidies&#13;
represented about 4 percent of GDP over the 2001-2011 period. In general, price subsidies&#13;
are high in fiscal cost, low in impact on household wellbeing, particularly in the poorer&#13;
households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Targeting and Coverage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
62.    Most safety net programs target highly vulnerable groups. The focus on children at&#13;
risk, the poorest rural communities and poor households affected by shocks fits well with&#13;
Togoâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability profile. However, for some of the programs, the actual profile of who&#13;
benefits is not known. For example, there are no verification systems for recipients of&#13;
health center fee waivers and households accessing the subsidized grain stocks. Universal&#13;
policies, like the fee waivers for education, benefit all school children except those that still&#13;
are not enrolled (usually the poorest).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63.    Most of the safety net programs are still in their nascent stage with very low levels&#13;
of effective coverage (Table 6). The only two programs with significant coverage are the&#13;
universal fee waiver for education and the subsidized grain stock program, though in the&#13;
case of the latter there is no information on the actual number of households who benefit.&#13;
In terms of coverage of natural disaster victims, immediate assistance probably reaches a&#13;
significant number of victims, though whether this is sufficient or equitably distributed is&#13;
not known.&#13;

Costs and Financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
64.       Total expenditures on safety nets are quite low as a share of the national budget,&#13;
as a share of GDP and compared with expenditure levels in other African countries. On&#13;
average, between 2008-2010 safety nets, not including general price subsidies, annual&#13;
spending on safety nets amounted to almost 12 billion FCFA (Table 7). This represents about&#13;
7 percent of total social spending in the country, 1.8 percent of the national budget and 0.5&#13;
percent of GDP.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
65.     More spending goes to reactive, coping responses than preventative measures.&#13;
About half of the total amount spent on safety nets was for emergency in-kind distribution&#13;
in the face of shocks. Typically these are punctual supports that, while necessary, do not&#13;
make up part of a reliable nor predictable system of safety net support. Nutritional&#13;
supplements to malnourished children accounted for 14 percent, revealing the high costs of&#13;
not having sufficient preventive and productive safety nets in place. Spending on safety&#13;
nets that prevent destitution and malnutrition (e.g. public works, school lunches, fee&#13;
waivers, etc.) accounts for only one-third of safety net spending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
66.     The level of benefit per person varies widely across safety net programs (Figure 5)..&#13;
Nutritional recuperation entails a high cost per beneficiary, denoting the intensive nature of&#13;
the intervention in such life threatening circumstances. The four types of targeted support&#13;
to pre-identified beneficiaries â&#128;&#147; public works laborers, cash transfer recipients, poor rural&#13;
school children for school meals, and OEV/PVVIH for nutritional support â&#128;&#147; cost on a range&#13;
of 14,664 â&#128;&#147; 60,000 FCFA. These types and levels of benefit are aimed at developing human&#13;
capital and stabilizing minimum consumption. The ad-hoc programs of support either in&#13;
response to disasters or punctual support to the needy are lower in cost but typically do not&#13;
extend benefits over a very long period of time. The waiving of school fees had broad&#13;

&#13;
                                                   40&#13;
&amp;#12;coverage and a very low cost per beneficiary. The grain stock program costs an average of&#13;
900 million FCFA but the impact is diluted across a large number of potential beneficiaries.&#13;

&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
67.      The experience to date with safety nets highlight several issues to be taken into&#13;
consideration in developing a national social protection strategy:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      a) Coverage is inadequate. Programs will need to be selectively scaled up if safety nets&#13;
         are to serve the purpose of providing predictable support to the vulnerable&#13;
         populations. A national social protection strategy will need to prioritize&#13;
         interventions while seeking to increase coverage levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           41&#13;
&amp;#12;b) Overall spending levels are a small share of the national budget and reliant on&#13;
   donor funding. Safety net expenditures have yet to claim any significant part of&#13;
   national resources. The majority of programs are financed through international&#13;
   assistance, which has grown as Togo has pulled in support from its partners in&#13;
   response to recent shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
c) The lack of preventative programs translates in elevated costs of nutritional&#13;
   recuperation. The cost of recuperating one malnourished child is extremely high,&#13;
   and more than twice the cost of other forms of transfers (the pilot cash transfer or&#13;
   transfers made via LIPW payments) that could be effective at preventing&#13;
   malnutrition. A greater emphasis on prevention programs can help to lower the&#13;
   costs of more expensive coping responses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
d) There is a trade-off between coverage and intensity. The larger-scale programs of&#13;
   nutritional support including grain stocks reach, potentially, a large number of&#13;
   people but the benefit they deliver per person is very slight.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
e) Targeting systems need to be strengthened. For programs that deliver benefits to&#13;
   selected households, developing transparent targeting criteria is important. For&#13;
   example, the fee waiver for indigents in the health system does not have a&#13;
   systematic identification and screening tool nor consistent application across regions&#13;
   and health centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
f) While overall the safety net programs target key vulnerable groups, there are&#13;
   some gaps. Labor intensive public works have focused on rural areas. Youth&#13;
   unemployment in urban areas is a major issue, and although there have been major&#13;
   public works in recent years, the LIPW methodology and targeting have not been&#13;
   applied systematically to these efforts. In addition, households headed by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         42&#13;
&amp;#12;       elderly have a higher share of the poor, yet none of the major safety net programs&#13;
       target vulnerable elderly households (e.g. elderly without support from family).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.     Analysis of the Current Situation with Social Insurance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Types of Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
68.    Contributory social insurance programs in Togo include agencies that cover old age&#13;
pensions, disability, family allocations and health insurance to workers in the public and&#13;
formal private sectors. The core of the formal social security system in the country is put&#13;
forth in the â&#128;&#156;Loi n. 2011-006 portant sur la SÃ©curitÃ© Socialeâ&#128;&#157; promulgated 21 February 2011&#13;
which defines the social security regime as comprising three components: family&#13;
allocations, pensions and professional risks. The two main agencies of the contributory&#13;
social insurance system for pensions, disability and other allocations are the â&#128;&#156;Caisse de&#13;
Retraite du Togoâ&#128;&#157; (CRT) for civil service employees including military and judicial branches&#13;
and the â&#128;&#156;Caisse Nationale de SÃ©curitÃ© Socialeâ&#128;&#157; (CNSS) for private sector employees and&#13;
other categories of Government-employed staff. These two systems are non-capitalized&#13;
schemes, where active employee and employer contributions fund payments of pensions.&#13;
Both institutions area semi-autonomous public bodies, the CRT is under the responsibility of&#13;
the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the CNSS under the Ministry of Employment and&#13;
Social Security. The national institute for health insurance (â&#128;&#156;Institute National dâ&#128;&#153;Assurance&#13;
Maladieâ&#128;&#157; -INAM) provides health insurance coverage for the public sector, including the&#13;
central administration, local collectivities, para-public agencies, and retired public sector&#13;
workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
69.    Created in 1991, the CRT provides pensions, disability, survivor pensions, and&#13;
family allocations to the public sector. The retirement age is 50 or 60 depending on the&#13;
category of civil servant and 30 years of service is required. Family allocations are provided&#13;
for up to six children up to the age of 20. Medical expenses regarding work and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               43&#13;
&amp;#12;professional-related accidents and sickness are also covered. The CRT has also taken a&#13;
number of additional obligations which are not directly linked to social insurance, including&#13;
financial support for housing and severance payments. The contributory system is based on&#13;
civil servant contributions of 7 percent of base salaries and employer (State) contribution of&#13;
20 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
70.    Created in 1973, the CNSS manages a social security scheme for the private sector&#13;
(and parastatals) that provides retirement, disability and death allowances to its&#13;
policyholders. It offers protection against occupational hazards to workers in the private&#13;
sector and employees of State agencies. It also pays child benefits. Medical expenses&#13;
regarding work and professional-related accidents and sickness are also covered by CNSS.&#13;
Workers are vested after ten years and may receive pension payments at the age of 60. The&#13;
contributory system is based on 4 percent from salaried workers and 16.5 percent from the&#13;
employer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
71.    Recently created in 2011, INAM will provide health insurance for public sector&#13;
workers is its initial beneficiary group. Although the longer-term perspective on INAM is to&#13;
eventually create a universal health insurance mechanisms in Togo, including progressively&#13;
incorporating the salaried private sector the informal sector and eventually indigent&#13;
populations, the initial focus is on civil servants (active and retired) including the military.&#13;
The system is based upon a premium payment, with a three month vesting period, after&#13;
which members receive a membership card and can access a prescribed list of services. A 20&#13;
percent co-payment is applied to most services. The financing base of INAM is 7 percent of&#13;
the base salary, paid in equal amounts by the employee and the employer (State).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coverage and Targeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
72.    Only a small percentage of the population is covered by formal social security and&#13;
health insurance mechanisms (Table 8). Only five percent of adults participate in formal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                44&#13;
&amp;#12;social security schemes. Similarly, only 5 percent of families with children receive some type&#13;
of family allocation. In terms of retirement, 13 percent of the 60+ population receive&#13;
pensions via the CRT or CNSS. Within health insurance, an estimated 6 percent of the&#13;
population is covered by some type of health insurance, of which 4 percent is under the&#13;
INAM regime.&#13;

73.     Regarding targeting, contributory social insurance schemes typically target those&#13;
with an ability to pay. These are not poverty targeted programs. However, the extent to&#13;
which contributory systems are developed and functioning for those with the ability to pay,&#13;
the Government can train scarce resources on the social protection mechanism for the&#13;
population that cannot afford to pay (or pay much).&#13;

&amp;#12;Costs and Financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
74.      Public spending on contributory pensions is the largest area of social protection&#13;
spending (Table 9). Annual public spending from the State as employer totals about 1&#13;
percent of GDP. The bulk of this is for CRT pension payments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
75.      The relative value of the benefit varies greatly, with average CRT pensions the&#13;
most generous. Figure 6 shows the expenditures per beneficiary, with the division between&#13;
employer (State) and employee funding estimated depending on the overall cost sharing&#13;
arrangements through premiums. The average public sector pension through the CRT is 60&#13;
percent higher than the private sector pensions through CNSS.&#13;

 Does not include State expenditures for the small category of parastal workers covered under CNSS as data&#13;
 was not disaggregated for this category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
76.     The extent of effective coverage is threatened by the lack of a sustainable financial&#13;
framework for social security. Both CRT and CNSS are facing financial difficulties and&#13;
structural challenges, which sooner or later will threaten their survival. Actuarial studies&#13;
carried out on the CRT and CNSS revealed the following financial challenges:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
77.     The CRT is currently running a deficit and its financial problems, if not addressed,&#13;
could balloon to an annual deficit of 70 billion FCFA (constant 2009) by 2050, or 1.5&#13;
percent of GDP. Due to the decline in civil service positions, the contributory base is not&#13;
what was anticipated at the development of the CRT. A deficit of 9 billion FCFA was&#13;
registered in 2009. Currently, the ratio of pensioners to active contributors is 1 to 3.2 (1 to&#13;
2.4 if beneficiaries of pensions de reversion are included). The annuity rate is particularly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     47&#13;
&amp;#12;high, leading to more generous pensions than the average for African public sector pensions&#13;
in comparison with contributions. The poor financial parameters and its implications over&#13;
the long term has been partially hidden by the relative youth of the system, with relatively&#13;
few pensioners at the beginning. Actuarial studies reveal that the current level of benefits&#13;
and premiums would provide sufficient financing for an average of 3 years of retirement,&#13;
while the average civil servant lives 19 years past the age of retirement.10 To balance the&#13;
system, without changing benefits, the rate of contributions would have to rise from 27&#13;
percent of base salary to 80 percent by 2050. The Government has undertaken some&#13;
reforms, like disallowing severance payments upon retirement, but broader parametric&#13;
reforms have yet to be undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
78.     The financial situation of CNSS also reveals long-run deficits, though not as severe&#13;
as the CRT. In 2009, the CNSS ran a 1.4 billion FCFA deficit on its operations. In total, the&#13;
debt burden of the government weighing on the CNSS is close to 100 billion CFA francs&#13;
(loans, arrears of contributions, and their interests), a situation which has eroded the cash&#13;
position of the company.11 There is a structural deficit on retirement pensions,&#13;
compensated in part via a surplus from family allocations. If nothing is done to address the&#13;
situation, actuarial analysis estimates and annual deficit of 50 billion FCFA by 2050. To&#13;
achieve financial equilibrium, contributions will need to increase from 12 to 16 percent of&#13;
base salary. Financial health of CNSS would also be reinforced by expanding the number of&#13;
contributors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
79.     As a new agency, INAM is not yet in a position of financial instability. However,&#13;
similar risks are present unless the State negotiates transparent and efficient prices for&#13;
health services with providers. To ensure both the financial sustainability of INAM and that&#13;
sufficient resources flow to the health services to keep them viable, premiums and the cost&#13;

&amp;#12;structure of health services covered will need to be modeled taking into consideration the&#13;
availability of health services and the types of health care needs of the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
80.    The formal mechanisms of social insurance, in particular pensions, disability, and&#13;
health insurance, have limited coverage at the present time. For Togo to achieve its vision&#13;
of â&#128;&#152;social protectionâ&#128;&#153; for all, the coverage of the contributory system will need to be&#13;
expanded. Out of approximately 200,000 households of salaried workers (public and&#13;
private), only about one-half to one-quarter are covered by social insurance. This makes&#13;
the majority more vulnerable to income and health shocks, despite their better&#13;
employment status. This is a particularly concern given the poverty profile that shows risks&#13;
of poverty rising with age of the head of household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
81.    The current social insurance systems under the CRT and CNSS is unsustainable, and&#13;
so does not provide a reliable basis to the population currently covered. In recent years,&#13;
the CRT has often delayed pension payments and accumulated significant arrears. The&#13;
fiduciary management of CRT and CNSS has created concerns among their pensioners about&#13;
the reliability and credibility of the social insurance system. Moreover, actuarial analysis&#13;
reveals that financial imbalances are only expected to worsen, putting future pensioners at&#13;
risk. Major reforms are needed with both the CRT and the CNSS in order to deliver on the&#13;
promise of future financial support to pensioners is unlikely. Continuing with the status quo&#13;
will blow up annual operating deficits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
82.    It will be difficult to consider seeking to expand the existing arrangements into the&#13;
informal sector without creating a more sustainable model for pensions and other social&#13;
insurance coverage. The new social security code (loi n. 2011-06 du fevrier 2011 portant&#13;
code de la sÃ©curitÃ© sociale) foresees the expansion of social security arrangements to&#13;
independent and informal sector workers. This can only be successful if the credibility and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               49&#13;
&amp;#12;reliability of the CNSS and CRT is addressed. Moreover, other models are being&#13;
experimented with in the African context for extending social insurance to the informal&#13;
sector, for instance through voluntary savings mechanisms or through other forms of&#13;
mutual insurance via professional associations, which could provide alternatives for the&#13;
Government to consider.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
83.    It will be important to further develop INAM within a coherent national health&#13;
care strategy, integrating the supply and financing of services with contributory and non-&#13;
contributory solidarity mechanisms. This will require placing INAM within sectoral&#13;
strategies and priority programs. The relationship of INAM to the growing number of health&#13;
mutual insurance schemes will need to be considered, particularly with the idea of&#13;
expanding INAM beyond the public sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
84.    Ensuring that contributory social insurance systems do not create an unintentional&#13;
drain of limited fiscal resources is important to the overall financing of social protection in&#13;
Togo. There is a risk that financial problems in the contributory systems will crowd out&#13;
resources to the non-contributory part of the social protection portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E.     Analysis of the Current Situation with Labor Market Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Types of Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
85.    Social protection-related interventions in labor market and employment issues are&#13;
largely oriented to the protection of vulnerable workers and the promotion of access to&#13;
employment of specific vulnerable groups likely to be excluded from the labor market. In&#13;
the context of current activities in Togo this includes several active labor market programs&#13;
oriented to improving employability and future employment prospects for targeted groups&#13;
and the strengthening of labor standards and regulations to protect workers from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              50&#13;
&amp;#12;workplace hazards. While they address employment issues, labor intensive public works are&#13;
classified under safety net interventions and were addressed in that section of the report.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
86.      Active labor market programs are relatively small in scale, with several pilots&#13;
initiated recently focusing on youth employment (Table 10):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      a) Appui Ã  lâ&#128;&#153;Insertion et au DÃ©veloppement de lâ&#128;&#153;Embauche (AIDE) is a program&#13;
         initiated in 2011 by the Agence National de lâ&#128;&#153;Emploi which seeks to a) allow first-&#13;
         time job seekers to acquire professional experience ; b) to provide access to work&#13;
         and hence a source of income; c) to help employers access qualified labor. The goal&#13;
         of AIDE is to facilitate the entrance into the labor market of young people with&#13;
         school diplomas via hands on training. The pilot phase of this program to create&#13;
         conditions of â&#128;&#152;employabilityâ&#128;&#153; of first time job seekers between eh ages of 18 and 40&#13;
         years founded on internships in private enterprises but financed via the State is&#13;
         designed for three years. Work internships are for between 6 and 12 months with&#13;
         salary at 70 percent. The participating enterprises pay 2.5 percent for work-place&#13;
         insurance. AIDE is currently in its three year pilot phase (2011-2013). The objective is&#13;
         to reach 3000 people during its three-year pilot phase (2011-2013). In 2011, AIDE&#13;
         received 23,000 applications for 600 positions filled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      b) The Programme de Promotion du Volontariat National au Togo (PROVONAT) was&#13;
         also initiated in 2011 under the responsibility of the Ministry of Community&#13;
         Development. The program has similar objectives in that it seeks to help&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  51&#13;
&amp;#12;   unemployed youth with diplomas to acquire their first professional experiences,&#13;
   thereby increasing their employability on the labor market. However, while AIDE&#13;
   focuses on private enterprise, PROVONAT places youth in NGOs, development&#13;
   associations, public administration, local government, and unions. During the&#13;
   programs initial year, placements focused on agriculture, health, civil works, and&#13;
   social action. Volunteers receive a monthly allocation of between 40,000 and 60,000&#13;
   FCFA depending on their level. Internships last from six to twelve months, with the&#13;
   possibility of renewing. The pilot initial year of PRONOVAT sought to cover 1,000&#13;
   youth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
c) The Projet de Developpement Communautaire (PDC), under the supervision of the&#13;
   Ministry of Community Development, provides grants for income generating&#13;
   activities to targeted groups in the poorest rural communities as a way of improving&#13;
   their employment and income. These activities benefit small groups within the&#13;
   targeted vulnerable communities and primarily consist of small projects in fishing,&#13;
   arts and crafts, and production, transformation, storage and marketing of&#13;
   agricultural products. During its first phase, PCD facilitated 174 income generating&#13;
   activities (IGAs) that benefited small groups of people within the targeted&#13;
   communities. A qualitative evaluation was carried out that concluded that the&#13;
   micro-projects were found to have improved the quality of life of the children in the&#13;
   households participating, including reduction in child labor, improved nutrition,&#13;
   increased ability to purchase school supplies and improved social cohesion at the&#13;
   local level. The PCDâ&#128;&#153;s second phase is starting in 2012 and will finance approximately&#13;
   150 IGAs with a maximum cost of up to US$5,000 each. All subprojects are screened&#13;
   for technical soundness as well as both short-term and medium-term profitability.&#13;
   Beneficiaries are offered training, management support and technical assistance so&#13;
   as to maximize profits and sustainability. The second phase will introduce targeting&#13;
   criteria and limit the grant size to discourage better off entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         52&#13;
&amp;#12;87.     In addition to these active interventions to facilitate access to jobs and income, a&#13;
number of regulatory and legal changes have been made to address vulnerability&#13;
concerns regarding labor market practices. This has been an ongoing area of interest of the&#13;
Government. In 1999 Togo signed the international convention on the worst forms of child&#13;
labor. In 2007, the Government classified domestic work among the worst form of labor and&#13;
prohibited children under 18 year to be employed as domestic help in response to the high&#13;
numbers of young girls that are victims of exploitative work as household servants each&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Targeting and Coverage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
88.     These programs remain small in coverage as most are in or just completing their&#13;
pilot phases (Table 11). They cover an insignificant share of the target population.&#13;
However, it is important to start with pilot-scale activities in order to test approaches,&#13;
develop effective operational procedures and evaluate outcomes before scaling up to larger&#13;
coverage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
89.     Targeting these programs to those in greatest need is a challenge. For PRONOVAT&#13;
and AIDE, they already draw from a pool that is not very representative of the poorer&#13;
populations â&#128;&#147; youth with diplomas. While this group is vulnerable in the sense that they&#13;
wait on average over 3 years before finding their first job, they are often not the poorest&#13;
segments of the labor market. Nonetheless, they are apolitically volatile group that can&#13;
affect the overall social stability of the country. The PCD AGR interventions are probably&#13;
reaching poorer households as they are centered in the rural areas, although phase 1 did&#13;
find that often the more dynamic groups were accessing AGR funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
            a) The program AIDE is financed by the Government of Togo for a total of 1.5&#13;
                billion FCFA for the three-year first phase, with 420 million FCFA inscribed in&#13;
                the 2011 budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            b) PRONOVAT received 500 million FCFA in the 2011 Government budget and&#13;
                receives support from UNDP, du Programme des Volontaires des Nations&#13;
                Unies et de Frances Volontaires.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            c) PCD IGA received 1.75US$ million over the 3 years of implementation of the&#13;
                first phase through October 2011. 275 IGA at an average cost of little bit&#13;
                more than 6,000US$ each- 5,300 beneficiaries (58% women).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                54&#13;
&amp;#12;91.      Costs per beneficiary range are relatively high. The annual cost per beneficiary for&#13;
AIDE is about 500,000 FCFA, for PROVONAT 330,000 FCFA and for the IGA subprojects of&#13;
PCD about 230,000. This is lower than the annual transfers for pensions but far greater&#13;
than any of the safety net programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
92.      The experience with targeted labor market interventions raises several issues that&#13;
will need to be addressed in a national social protection strategy:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      a) Most approaches are in their pilot stage. There needs to be a sufficient evaluation&#13;
         base to justify scaling up these programs. An impact evaluation is currently&#13;
         underway for AIDE and the IGA subprojects of PCD were evaluated in the first phase&#13;
         (leading to some significant design changes). Outcomes should be measured in&#13;
         terms of skills developed during the internship (for AIDE and PROVONAT) as well as&#13;
         labor market indicators like success at finding post-internship employment, number&#13;
         of hours of employment and income generated. Full program effects may take&#13;
         longer-term tracer studies to see labor market insertion rates several years after the&#13;
         beneficiary receives support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      b) Even if these approaches work and can be scaled up, there are large gaps in&#13;
         reaching certain target groups. For example, the three programs target either&#13;
         formal sector employment or rural areas. There is a challenge to develop&#13;
         approaches for expanded employment and improved incomes in the urban informal&#13;
         sector, which accounts for a significant share of the vulnerable population,&#13;
         particularly urban youth that do not have diplomas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               55&#13;
&amp;#12;V.       Towards a National Social Protection Policy and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
93.      This section provides recommendation to the Government on possible social&#13;
protection policy and strategy based on the review of poverty and vulnerability and the&#13;
status of the current situation of social protection interventions. There is a need for both&#13;
overarching policies and strategies for achieving social protection goals:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             a) Policy is a statement of principles guiding the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s operations and&#13;
                 decision-making. Policies outline rules and provide principles that guide&#13;
                 actions. Policies should be clear and measurable statements of general&#13;
                 objectives and intended outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             b) Strategy is the bridge between policy or high-order goals on the one hand&#13;
                 and tactics or concrete actions on the other. Strategy is a plan developed to&#13;
                 successfully achieve an overall goal or objective. The necessary precondition&#13;
                 for formulating strategy is a clear and shared understanding of the ends to be&#13;
                 obtained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
94.      To assist the Government in determining its social protection policy and strategy,&#13;
this section:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      a) Identifies overarching goals and objectives drawn from existing Government&#13;
         statements to articulate an overall social protection policy and a set of guiding&#13;
         principles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      b) Develops possible directions for social protection strategy to achieve the overall&#13;
         goals, including identification of priority programs, proposals for institutional&#13;
         responsibilities and coordination mechanisms, general budgeting and financing&#13;
         issues and proposed mechanisms for measuring results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                56&#13;
&amp;#12;      c) Specifies elements to develop a more integrated national social protection system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.       Defining a National Social Protection Policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Goals and Objectives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
95.      The goal of a national social protection policy is to reduce poverty, improve living&#13;
conditions and promote broad-based economic growth by building an inclusive and&#13;
reliable national social protection system. A national social protection policy and strategy is&#13;
an important foundation to orienting the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s future actions in the area of social&#13;
protection. A national social protection policy seeks to increase the number of people with&#13;
access to social protection, particularly the most vulnerable groups, and heighten the&#13;
impact of social protection programs on creating human capital, economic opportunity and&#13;
resilience. The vision of Â« social protection for all Â» seeks to guarantee access of all citizens&#13;
to social protection through measures that should be derived from a coherent strategy,&#13;
supported by legislation, and financed to a level sufficient to meet the global objective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
96.      At the Â« Social Protection for All Â» workshop in January 2012 a general objective&#13;
for social protection was identified as :&#13;
Â« protect the Togolese population against vulnerabilities and social risks Â»&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
97.      A core set of specific social protection objectives that would respond to the current&#13;
needs of Togo could include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Objective # 1: Develop and extend a reliable and financially sustainable&#13;
contributory social insurance system that addresses the risks of old age, death and&#13;
disability to all households able to participate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                57&#13;
&amp;#12;Strategic Objective # 2: Ensure access to health services, improve health outcomes and&#13;
mitigate the adverse effects of health shocks by developing contributory mechanisms of&#13;
health insurance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Objective # 3: Prevent destitution and build human capital of the most vulnerable&#13;
through an integrated system of safety net interventions that address the needs of the&#13;
chronic poor, those affected by shocks and the needs of specific vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Objective # 4: Promote employability and access to jobs and income and safe&#13;
working conditions among groups likely to be excluded from the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Guiding Principles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
98.    Several general principals should guide the translation of these broad policy goals&#13;
into strategic actions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) In terms of outcomes, social protection interventions should seek to create&#13;
               opportunities, increase resilience and encourage equity by providing&#13;
               essential support to those living in poverty, providing a safety-net to those in&#13;
               danger of falling into poverty, supporting people to pull themselves out of&#13;
               poverty and graduate from the need for social protection. The integration of&#13;
               these aspects is critical to achieving the outcomes desired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Priority should be given to the most significant risks and the most&#13;
               vulnerable populations. Togo is at the initial stages of building more resilient&#13;
               and comprehensive social protection systems. The needs are great and&#13;
               resources are limited. Institutions have limited experience and&#13;
               implementation capacity. The social protection strategy will need to be&#13;
               selective, while responding the areas of greatest vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              58&#13;
&amp;#12;c) The social protection strategy should address vulnerabilities of the different&#13;
   stages of life, with a particular emphasis on children and youth. Children are&#13;
   particularly vulnerable and ensuring the development of human capital of&#13;
   the next generation is important for the future of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
d) Gender equity should be embedded in social protection strategies to address&#13;
   the particular vulnerabilities of women and the greater risk of their exclusion&#13;
   from resources and services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
e) Social protection strategies need to support and reinforce sectoral&#13;
   strategies. Social protection contributes to sectoral goals like expanded&#13;
   access to health and education, rural development via productive&#13;
   infrastructure, and natural disaster response. As such there needs to be&#13;
   policy consistency and coordination between social protection and sectoral&#13;
   policies sand strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
f) Social protection strategies need to be built on a sound evidence base. To be&#13;
   effective, social protection systems need to be informed by sound analysis of&#13;
   risks and vulnerabilities. There also need to be program evaluations that&#13;
   demonstrate progress towards outcomes prior to scaling up. This is&#13;
   particularly important in justifying increased spending of scarce fiscal&#13;
   resources to support national social protection efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
g) Transparency and good governance are essential to creating credible social&#13;
   protection systems and for ensuring the effective utilization of resources.&#13;
   Social protection systems should provide predictability to beneficiaries.&#13;
   Targeting and selection of beneficiaries should be based on clear and&#13;
   transparent criteria and selection processes. And, contributory systems&#13;
   should provide assurance of effective fiduciary management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  59&#13;
&amp;#12;          h) The social protection strategy should promote partnerships and seek&#13;
              synergies between areas of social protection. A broad range of institutional&#13;
              actors are involved in social protection, including multiple Government&#13;
              ministries and agencies, international partners, NGOs and the private sector.&#13;
              A harmonized approach will avoid dispersion of efforts and increase impacts.&#13;
              This coordination between actors should extend to reinforcing synergies&#13;
              between social protection interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.    Developing a National Social Protection Strategy: Priority Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
99.   Translating the overall goals and principles of a national social protection policy&#13;
into a medium-term strategy should seek to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a) Build on the existing social protection efforts of the Government . Over the last&#13;
          several years, the Government has made significant strides at creating the basis&#13;
          for a more comprehensive national social protection system. Fee waiver policies&#13;
          in health and education, creation of INAM, development and piloting of labor&#13;
          intensive public works, school lunches, and cash transfers (slated for 2012), and&#13;
          employment insertion programs for youth have created the institutional and&#13;
          operational basis for an expanded social protection agenda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       b) Identify any key gaps for vulnerable groups which will require developing new&#13;
          programs or approaches. For example, the elderly poor and the informal sector&#13;
          have been traditionally difficult to reach with typical social insurance&#13;
          mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       c) Be coherent with the nationâ&#128;&#153;s overall poverty reduction strategy, as put forth&#13;
          in the national poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             60&#13;
&amp;#12;         d) Be supported by a legal framework (legislative and regulatory) that codifies the&#13;
             rights of citizens and responsibilities of institutional actors in the effective&#13;
             provision of social protection measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
100.     The implementation of a national social protection strategy will be oriented to the&#13;
progressive expansion of priority programs outlined under each of the strategic objectives&#13;
below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Box 1. Strategic Objective 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Reinforce and extend a reliable and financially sustainable contributory social insurance&#13;
  system that addresses the risks of old age, death and disability to all households able to&#13;
  participate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
101.     To achieve this strategic objective, the national social protection strategy will need&#13;
to address the critical risks and opportunities identified earlier in this report regarding the&#13;
existing social insurance system related to financial sustainability, governance, coverage,&#13;
and extension beyond the formal sector:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 1.a: Carry out parametric reforms that address the structural deficits&#13;
and future financial sustainability of the CRT and CNSS to ensure that retirees are&#13;
protected and the drain on public finances is minimized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
102.     Reforms are needed for both pension funds to allow the Government of Togo to&#13;
reduce the fiscal liability it is facing. Restructuring the pension system will not only ensure&#13;
income security for retirees and other beneficiaries but will also unleash much needed&#13;
longer-term funds for the development of the economy. Actuarial analysis has developed a&#13;
set of recommendations and options for parametric reforms that will be necessary to put&#13;
the CRT and CNSS on a more solid financial footing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 61&#13;
&amp;#12;103.   For the CRT, parameters where reforms could have a significant impact on financial&#13;
sustainability include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Harmonization of the legal retirement age to 60 years across all categories of&#13;
               public servants with the exception of the uniformed services and introduce&#13;
               early retirement or delayed retirement options.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Reduction in the taux dâ&#128;&#153;annuites (a 2%) to be more consistent with norms of&#13;
               the sub-region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c) Progressive changes to the number of years taken into account for&#13;
               determining the reference salary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           d) Revaluation of pensions on basis of inflation or salary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
104.   For the CNSS, actuarial studies have identified the following parametric reforms as&#13;
       worthy of consideration:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        a) Increase in the number of salary years used in the base calculation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        b) Maintain the global rate of contribution but rebalance the internal distribution&#13;
            between retirement and family allocations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       c) A change in the indexation mechanism to inflation or salaries to address the&#13;
           erosion in the real value of CNSS pensions by 60 percent over the last 30 years&#13;
           despite indexation to the legal minimum wage foreseen in the law and thus&#13;
           better protect the retirees from poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             62&#13;
&amp;#12;105.   No one reform with solve the challenges facing the CRT and CNSS. Relative financial&#13;
efficiency and political feasibility varies by option. There are several alternatives of a packet&#13;
of reforms that could stabilize the financial future of the current social insurance schemes,&#13;
with each parametric reform contributing a portion of the financial re-equilibration needed.&#13;
In addition, the Government should consider gradually moving to a capitalization system&#13;
that can begin to address the demographic shift that is just beginning but will accelerate&#13;
towards an aging population. A capitalization system will begin to build resources so that&#13;
there is a financial foundation for the time when the balance between pensioners and&#13;
active employees contributing into the scheme is tilted more to covering pensioners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 1.b: Separate the risks of old age, death and disability managed by the&#13;
CRT from other employment benefits provided by the State to its employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
106.   Several unfunded mandates have been added to the CRT since 1991 having to do&#13;
with financial advantages linked to the number of years worked, severance payments and&#13;
other costs associated with retrenchments, bonuses for children and for disability pensions,&#13;
and coverage of half of health expenditures. Technically, these do not form part of the&#13;
pension scheme but account for 20 percent of the CRT annual deficit. Shifting these&#13;
obligations to the Budget of the State would address a significant portion of the financial&#13;
imbalances of CRT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 1.c: Carry out institutional reforms of CRT and CNSS to improve the&#13;
institutional functioning and governance of the social insurance system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
107.   Studies of the social insurance system have identifies institutional reforms beyond&#13;
those that aim to improve financial sustainability that will strengthen the performance of&#13;
the CRT and CNSS. Institutional reforms to consider include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               63&#13;
&amp;#12;          a) Technical reforms, including of the data sheets for contributors and&#13;
              beneficiaries, internal controls etc. are a necessary precondition for the&#13;
              management of new contributors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          b) Development and implementation of an information and technology master&#13;
              plan to improve the management of information;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          c) Training to strengthening the capacity of the human resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          d) Consideration of options for developing a common management&#13;
           organization merging functions of the CNSS and CRT (and perhaps INAM) in&#13;
           order to increase administrative efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 1.d: Extend contributory social security mechanisms to the informal&#13;
sector, agricultural cooperatives and independent workers to reach a more vulnerable&#13;
population with social insurance mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   108.       There are several options to extending social insurance beyond the salaried&#13;
       worker:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          a) If sufficient parametric reforms are carried out to stabilize the system, access&#13;
              to the formal social insurance mechanisms could be extended to&#13;
              cooperatives and individual workers interested in joining.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          b) Building access to social insurance through the mutuelle model. The&#13;
              â&#128;&#152;associativeâ&#128;&#153; sector holds the most opportunity for extension of social&#13;
              insurance. With 20,000 agricultural cooperatives covering 1.5 million&#13;
              potential beneficiaries, the extension of social insurance mechanisms to the&#13;
              segment is a priority. Togoâ&#128;&#153;s over 600,000 artisans is also an important target&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             64&#13;
&amp;#12;               group. The associative structure creates a basis for pooling risks associated&#13;
               not only with health but also other social risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c) Alternative mechanisms more appropriate to the circumstances of informal&#13;
               sector workers could be developed. For example, micro-insurance schemes&#13;
               have grown in importance in Africa facilitated in part by the extension of the&#13;
               micro-finance model into the area of insurance. In addition, there are a&#13;
               growing number of programs that seek to extend retirement and disability&#13;
               insurance to the informal sector using voluntary mechanisms linked to&#13;
               savings and other financial sector services, creating incentives for workers to&#13;
               join. This may have significant benefits beyond participation in a social&#13;
               insurance system, including their inclusion in the business taxation system&#13;
               and other activities that today are unregistered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           d) Although the private insurance market is still shallow, there may be room to&#13;
               start introducing elements of private schemes and regulatory framework in&#13;
               this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           e) Bundling insurance with other targeted social protection programs can be an&#13;
               effective way to reach poor households. For example, premiums for&#13;
               disability, retirement contributions and/or health insurance can be bundled&#13;
               with payments to workers engaged in labor-intensive public works or&#13;
               recipients of cash transfers to provide a broader array of protections to these&#13;
               vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
109.   Achieving this specific objective will require more analytical analysis to assess and&#13;
design appropriate systems. This includes: (a) an assessment of the capacity to contribute,&#13;
(b) specifications of efficient mechanisms to collect premia; (c) development of a sufficient&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              65&#13;
&amp;#12;contractual basis to protect worker contributions and ensure coverage; (d) actuarial studies&#13;
to develop financially sustainable parameters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Box 2. Strategic Objective 2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Ensure access to health services, improve health outcomes and mitigate the adverse&#13;
 effects of health shocks by developing contributory mechanisms of health insurance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
110.   Access to affordable health services and protection from health shocks is a priority&#13;
for the citizens of Togo. The Ministry of Health is responsible for the development and&#13;
provision of public health services. The role of social protection within this is to support the&#13;
application of social insurance mechanisms to pool risks and provide an insurance-based&#13;
funding contribution to the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 2.a: Continue the implementation of INAM to ensure that it can fulfill&#13;
its immediate mandate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
111.   INAMâ&#128;&#153;s immediate mandate is to cover public sector workers (active and retired).&#13;
While INAMâ&#128;&#153;s structure could serve as the basis for an expanded system, given its newness&#13;
(created in 2011) care should be taken to ensure that it is functioning properly and has the&#13;
right legal, technical, human and financial resources in place before scaling out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
112.   Priorities include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Coordination with the Ministry of Health to ensure that INAM is integrated&#13;
               within the PNDS and priority programs and vertical programs of the Ministry&#13;
               of Health (e.g. subvention a la cesarean) and that public spending on health&#13;
               services is rationalized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               66&#13;
&amp;#12;           b) Development of a national health map that identifies levels of service&#13;
               available in different geographic areas as well as the real health care needs of&#13;
               the population by geographic zone.&#13;
           c) Implementation of solid fiduciary mechanisms that provide transparency and&#13;
               control on contributions and payments for health services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           d) Beyond public sector workers, the initial scale out that would be the easiest&#13;
               to effectuate would be to extend health coverage to contributors of CNSS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 2.b: Develop mechanisms to address the â&#128;&#152;missing middleâ&#128;&#153; between&#13;
coverage for salaried workers and support for indigent patients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
113.   Reforms to the contributory system covering the formal sector and improvements to&#13;
the system for supporting indigent patients (see Specific Objective 3b under safety nets&#13;
below) leaves the majority of the population at risk for the financial implications of health&#13;
shocks. A significant portion of this population could provide some form of premium&#13;
payments. Mutual health insurances are being developed on the basis of professional&#13;
organizations or local entities sharing geographic proximity (community-based mutual&#13;
health insurance). The acceleration of the creation of mutual health insurance calls for:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a) The formulation of a national strategy for health mutual to provide coherence&#13;
           with public health services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       b) The development of clear legislative and regulatory parameters around this&#13;
           growing sector to provide legal protections to members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       c) Consideration of the potential role that INAM could play in managing payments&#13;
           and identifying contributors in support of the mutual health, which would create&#13;
           new branches of health insurance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              67&#13;
&amp;#12;       d) The development of public sector subsidy mechanisms to support the extension&#13;
           of insurance mechanisms to the informal sector and indigent populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 2.c: Develop technical options to reach universal coverage of health&#13;
insurance in the medium- to long-term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
114.   For technical and financial reasons it is not possible at this point in time to launch a&#13;
universal system of health insurance. INAM is just getting up and running and lacks&#13;
implementation experience and a sufficient technical platform. The financial impact to the&#13;
national budget is bound to be significant as well as to households in terms of their&#13;
payments to a contributory system. Nonetheless, efforts to reinforce INAM, reform the&#13;
system for financing indigent care and develop stronger mechanisms for mutual health&#13;
insurance will create the foundations for the future extension of a universal system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Box 3. Strategic Objective 3&#13;
&#13;
 Prevent destitution and build human capital of the most vulnerable, notably children,&#13;
 through an integrated system of safety net interventions that address the needs of the&#13;
 chronic poor, those affected by shocks and catastrophes and the needs of specific&#13;
 vulnerable groups and facilitate their access to basic social services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
115.   Safety nets can make important contributions to preventing destitution, building&#13;
human capital and supporting broad-based economic growth. Overall, they should target&#13;
the most important risks and vulnerable groups and be designed to optimize impacts on the&#13;
ability of the poor to rise out of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 3.a: Put in place cash transfer programs and labor intensive public&#13;
works programs to reinforce the capacity of the poorest and most vulnerable households&#13;
and prevent destitution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              68&#13;
&amp;#12;116.   Temporary income support, whether via cash transfers or labor intensive public&#13;
works, prevents short-term food insecurity and destitution and enables households to&#13;
access other public services â&#128;&#147; such as health and education â&#128;&#147; by enabling them to overcome&#13;
the financial barriers that they may face. The infrastructure created through LIPW public&#13;
works crates assets for poor communities including better roads and market infrastructure,&#13;
environmental rehabilitation and greater local social services of proximity. Both cash&#13;
transfers and temporary employment programs create scalable platforms to address not&#13;
only the chronic poor but populations affected by shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
117.   Labor intensive public works as part of a safety net was piloted in response to the&#13;
2009 economic crisis under the Community Development Project. This provided an&#13;
important opportunity to test approaches and implementation modalities. Further&#13;
developing labor-intensive public works as a core program of Togoâ&#128;&#153;s social safety net should&#13;
focus on:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            a) Coherence with participatory local infrastructure planning mechanisms to&#13;
               ensure that the public works reflect community priorities and are integrated&#13;
               with sectoral ministries investment planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            b) Sufficient non-labor resources and technical supervision to ensure quality&#13;
               and that the full impacts of the infrastructure are realized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            c) Refinement of the payment mechanism to address limitations of using the&#13;
               postal system. Microfinance institutions offer local financial services as one&#13;
               option. Other countries in Africa are experimenting with payments made via&#13;
               cell phones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            d) Stronger collaboration with the regional platforms for disaster risk reduction&#13;
               so as to identify high labor-demand activities that contribute to increase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              69&#13;
&amp;#12;               resilience of the population to the negative impact of weather-related shocks&#13;
               and climate change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           e) In order the scale up beyond the next phase target of temporary&#13;
               employment opportunities for 10,000 people, introduction of the concept of&#13;
               contingency planning to enable rapid scale up in the event additional&#13;
               resources are identified or a crisis hits that requires a short-term response.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
118.   Togo is about to embark on a cash transfer pilot, experimenting with a safety net&#13;
mechanism that has proven effective in other African contexts and throughout the&#13;
developing world at protecting households from destitution while building human capital&#13;
and assets important to rising out of poverty over the longer-term. The pilot, with an&#13;
expected coverage of 8,000 children, should be evaluated with a view to scaling up if&#13;
successful, paying particular attention to :&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Effectiveness of targeting. The pilot targets children at-risk of malnutrition or&#13;
               already severely malnourished in the northern regions of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Appropriateness of the amount of the transfer. Transfers set too low may be&#13;
               insufficient to have the intended impact, but those set too high can invite&#13;
               elite capture and make it financially difficult to scale up. Consistently with&#13;
               established good practice, the amount of the transfers is around one third of&#13;
               the absolute poverty line and the transfers will be given to&#13;
               mothers/caregivers rather than to the head of household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c) Effect of the conditionalities. Conditionalities are designed to promote the&#13;
               human capital outcomes desired as well as create accountability on the part&#13;
               of recipient households. The pilot includes soft conditionalities of having a&#13;
               birth certificate for the child, attending training and growth monitoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               70&#13;
&amp;#12;               sessions and schooling older siblings; strong compliance will be rewarded&#13;
               with extra cash.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       d) Institutional capacity. The MASSN is responsible for finalizing beneficiary&#13;
           registration, checking on compliance with the soft conditionalities, providing&#13;
           complementary household support, and monitoring activities in collaboration&#13;
           with AGAIB staff, who are responsible for the fiduciary management of the&#13;
           program. An evaluation of performance is necessary before possible scaling up&#13;
           of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 3.b: Ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable have access to health&#13;
services and health care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
119.   The absence of a common tool and criteria for identifying who qualifies as indigent&#13;
for financial coverage for health services opens the door to varying interpretations and&#13;
applications of financial support. In addition, there is no central monitoring of the system of&#13;
payment to health services for indigent patient coverage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
120.   Reforms to the system of indigent care should include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Definition of standard criteria for identifying indigent patients. This should be&#13;
               easily verifiable and transparent to both service providers and population at&#13;
               large. Developing a national proxy means test system for identifying indigent&#13;
               households could serve as the basis for this system. Community-based&#13;
               targeting mechanisms are an important complement to this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Modeling of the financial impact depending on the level of services and&#13;
               population coverage to develop a target number of persons that could be&#13;
               covered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              71&#13;
&amp;#12;           c) Developing notional financial allocations per health structure, for instance on&#13;
              a per capita basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           d) Systematization of beneficiary information, for instance through a health&#13;
              card that is managed outside of the health structures and the collection on&#13;
              the financial use of service information to exercise a level of control not now&#13;
              in existence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           e) Coordination with INAM to explore the potential for the indigent coverage to&#13;
              be considered under social insurance, to be funded by transfers from the&#13;
              Budget of the State to INAM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           f) Bundling of access to health care for indigents with other social protection&#13;
              programs, for example via identification of eligible beneficiaries participating&#13;
              in other safety net programs (e.g. nutritional recuperation, humanitarian&#13;
              assistance)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 3.c: Ensure access to education on the part of the most vulnerable&#13;
population in order to develop their human capital and promote societal equity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
121.   The Government has made strides in removing barriers to accessing education and&#13;
in developing incentives for school attendance as part of its broader education policy and&#13;
safety net goals. The policy of eliminating school fees for pre-primary and primacy&#13;
education has reduced some of the financial hurdles, though demand-side financial factors&#13;
like expenses needed for supplies or the opportunity cost of child labor remain. School&#13;
lunches and ad-hoc support for school supplies to needy families further promotes access.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
122.   Future efforts to be considered to ensure access to education by the most&#13;
vulnerable groups should identify the remaining constraints to the poorest families and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             72&#13;
&amp;#12;communities as well as the remaining 15 percent of children currently not attending&#13;
primary school. Possible priorities include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         a) Scaling up of the school lunch program. This means primarily a geographical&#13;
             expansion (more communities, more schools in more regions). Initial scale up&#13;
             could focus on cantons and schools with the highest poverty rates.12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         b) Reforming ad-hoc support through the National Solidarity Fund to a more&#13;
             programmatic approach, linking support for school supplies with other programs&#13;
             supporting OEVs, more transparent targeting and identification of vulnerable&#13;
             households for participation in other safety net programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         c) Assessing the impact of the cash transfer pilot on educational attainment of&#13;
             children in beneficiary families. Given the educational impacts usually observed&#13;
             in programs of this type, an expansion of the cash transfer system could make&#13;
             an important contribution to achieving educational access goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 3.d: Reduce financial barriers to access of food security and ensure&#13;
quality nutrition for households with children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
123.    Food insecurity and malnutrition is a result of a complex set of factors. Polices to&#13;
promote economic growth and employment, agricultural development that improves&#13;
productivity of smallholders and health sector policies that provide vitamin&#13;
supplementation, growth monitoring and health interventions for the malnourished are&#13;
important elements of the societyâ&#128;&#153;s response to this problem. Safety nets, too, have a role&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
  Additional expansion raises concern about targeting, as all children at a given school benefit. As the program&#13;
approaches universal coverage it would by definition include higher proportions of non-poor children. This&#13;
would evolve the program from a safety net focus providing incentives to attend school and nutritional&#13;
support to targeted populations, to more of an educational service approach as a basic part of the packet of&#13;
services parents can expect their children to receive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      73&#13;
&amp;#12;to play. Currently, the majority of safety net resources are designated to address these&#13;
issues, however the bulk of these are in ad-hoc humanitarian response via food distribution&#13;
programs. A scaled-up, programmatic approach could include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Link the households accessing nutritional recuperation centers with other&#13;
                safety net programs to promote graduation out of food insecurity over the&#13;
                longer-term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Promote behavioral change to better nutritional practices as an essential&#13;
                part of any short-term nutritional support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c) Expand both the LIPW and cash transfer programs in communities of&#13;
                heightened risk for malnutrition, trained on specific periods of year when&#13;
                rural households are at greatest risk. This could substitute for some of the&#13;
                existing ad-hoc food distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           d) Evaluate the role and functioning of the grain stock program to determine&#13;
                the targeting, performance and impact of the program with a view to&#13;
                assessing its effectiveness in meeting safety net objectives and food security.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           e) Assess the impact on food security of the full range of safety net&#13;
                interventions as they are scaled up in order to move gradually from punctual&#13;
                food aid to putting in place a permanent safety net system that addresses&#13;
                food insecurity in a more structural manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 3.e: Support social protection measures tailored to the needs of the&#13;
most vulnerable: orphans and victimized or exploited children, children in conflict with&#13;
the law, people affected by HIV/AIDS, the disabled, elderly and people affected by&#13;
catastrophes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               74&#13;
&amp;#12;124.   There are several vulnerable groups that, beyond general poverty and vulnerability&#13;
status, require a more specialized approach and packet of services. Either supportive family&#13;
structures are not in place, or the nature of the difficulty puts the group at higher risk for&#13;
exclusion from services or employment. Priority groups include orphans and vulnerable&#13;
children (children exploited, abused and in conflict with the law), people affected by&#13;
VIH/SIDA, and people with disabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
125.   Priorities to address the needs of these groups include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Reinforce the public awareness of the rights of children, people living with&#13;
               HIV/AIDs and the disabled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Support the line agency services of the MASSSN to these groups with&#13;
               capacity building, systematization of information, development of common&#13;
               beneficiary registries, and utilization of targeting methodologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c) Develop a common mechanism for community identification of needs and&#13;
               monitoring of services to OEV and other groups and their outcomes with&#13;
               links to MASSN regional services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           d) Provide training and communications to ensure that the Lignes Directrices,&#13;
               norms and standards developed for example for child protection are applied&#13;
               by all governmental and on-governmental actors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           e) Develop monitoring and evaluation tools that will permit the measurement&#13;
               of outcomes of these specialized services, not only in terms of coverage but&#13;
               in terms of access to services and other indicators of wellbeing of the&#13;
               households and individuals affected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               75&#13;
&amp;#12;           f) Develop and budget a packet of services to these vulnerable groups that&#13;
              contain all elements of prevention, promotion, and protection covering&#13;
              health and nutrition, education and capacity building, income support and&#13;
              development of productive capabilities, legal and psychosocial support. Not&#13;
              all elements will be needed in all cases, but a more integrated approach to&#13;
              services to these groups is called for.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 3.f: Complement disaster risk mitigation and response strategies with&#13;
safety net interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
126.   Shocks and disasters impact the poor the most because their asset base is low, their&#13;
risk management options limited and their coping responses entail high costs like pulling&#13;
children out of school or reducing caloric intake that can have long-term repercussions. The&#13;
Government is currently engaged in efforts to improve disaster management. For example,&#13;
General awareness campaigns about the risks of flooding and land degradation is being&#13;
conducted to educate the population about flood-prone areas, flood evacuation plans, and&#13;
flood prevention, and to improve readiness when such events occur. Complementary safety&#13;
net interventions can mitigate the effects of shocks on households, helping to protect assets&#13;
and ensure a minimum of consumption following natural disasters. Priorities for the&#13;
Government to consider include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a) Integration of the social protection system into the early warning systems to&#13;
           identify the need for a response as early as possible.&#13;
       b) Development of contingency mechanisms as part of risk mitigation and rapid&#13;
           response systems. These mechanisms would consist of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   i. contingency plans that identify the role and responsibility of social&#13;
                      protection interventions in the event of a disaster and provide&#13;
                      detailed response plans. Adequate institutional arrangements and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              76&#13;
&amp;#12;                       capacity in place or able to be put in place quickly to allow the pre-&#13;
                       prepared plans to be implemented; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   ii. the creation of contingent financing resources, which could be a&#13;
                       combination of government resources/reserves and upfront&#13;
                       commitments from donor agencies to be triggered in the case of an&#13;
                       adverse event. These contingency mechanisms would help in a more&#13;
                       timely response to shocks as well as train resources on areas of&#13;
                       greatest need.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Box 4. Strategic Objective 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Promote employability, access to jobs and income and decent working conditions&#13;
  among groups likely to be excluded from the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
127.   The absence of employment and sufficient income creates the basis for poverty and&#13;
vulnerability. Addressing the ability of the economy to create sufficient jobs is the goal of&#13;
the nationâ&#128;&#153;s overall economic and employment policies. The role of social protection within&#13;
this broader mandate is to promote access to jobs and income for groups likely to be&#13;
excluded from the labor market as well as to ensure safe working conditions and prohibit&#13;
exploitative conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 4.a: Increase access to employment and income among long-term&#13;
unemployed and underemployed, with a focus on youth, women and the disabled:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
128.   Supporting the opportunities for youth (ages 18-40) to be productively employed is&#13;
a core goal of the Government, whether via salaried employment, self-employment or in&#13;
the independent/informal sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              77&#13;
&amp;#12;129.   Priorities under a national social protection strategy to be considered include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Developing an overall approach to youth employment that distinguishes&#13;
               between approaches that are appropriate for school graduates accessing the&#13;
               formal sector, as well as less skilled youth likely to enter the informal sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Evaluate the targeting, performance and impact of the AIDE and PROVONAT&#13;
               programs with a view to scaling up if appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c) Seek to scale up the AGR activities being carried out through the Community&#13;
               Development Project with a focus on target rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           d) Introduce increased elements of skill training into the LIPW public works&#13;
               program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           e) Evaluate pilot approaches to youth employment currently being carried out&#13;
               in Africa with a view to identifying best practice approaches that could be&#13;
               piloted in the Togo context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific objective 4.b: Create favorable conditions for decent work and the elimination of&#13;
exploitation of vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
130.   Dangerous working conditions create conditions of vulnerability for certain groups,&#13;
for example those employed in unsafe working conditions or child labor subject to abuse&#13;
and exploitation. A new social security code was adopted which increases the rights of&#13;
workers and expands the application to independent workers and those in the informal&#13;
sector. In addition, to promote health workplaces, several legal texts applying the&#13;
Employment Code on Health and Security (Code du travail en santÃ© et securitÃ©) have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               78&#13;
&amp;#12;elaborated by the National Commission on Employment and Social Law (Conseil National du&#13;
Travail et des Lois Sociales (CNTLS)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
131.   Priorities for the national social protection strategy to be considered include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Awareness raising and capacity building for employers about the implications&#13;
               for workplace safety of the new social security code.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Capacity building to the MTESS to increase the ability to monitor compliance&#13;
               with the new social security code.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c) Improvements to the national system of labor market and work condition&#13;
               statistics to better reflect underlying work conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           d) Capitalizing on previous interventions and pilot actions to combat the worst&#13;
               form of child labor, diffuse the lessons learned throughout concerned&#13;
               agencies and community structures at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           e) Work across agencies to ensure that children found being exploited in work&#13;
               situations are integrated into safety net services to avoid their return to&#13;
               exploitative work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           f) Creation of effective monitoring and surveillance systems to follow individual&#13;
               cases as well as national tendencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              79&#13;
&amp;#12;C.      Towards a National Social Protection System&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
132.    The overall objective of these interventions should be to develop a coherent and&#13;
integrated national social protection system. Based on a clearly defined vision and&#13;
coherent set of policies, the implementation of this packet of priority programs and&#13;
measures will create a strong foundation of social protection for the most vulnerable&#13;
households and individuals. A national social protection system aggregates and integrates&#13;
these efforts based on a clearly specified legal and programmatic framework which clarifies&#13;
roles and responsibilities. The system is also based on agreed upon national objectives as&#13;
well as a minimum packet of services that may vary by vulnerable group but in its entirety&#13;
provides protections to all Togolese that helps them to prevent, mitigate and cope with a&#13;
full range of social risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
133.    A systems approach reduces fragmentation, promotes harmonization and can&#13;
enhance both the performance of individual programs and the overall functions of social&#13;
protection in creating opportunities, providing resilience and promoting equity. There are&#13;
several aspect to developing a national social protection system that should be prioritized&#13;
over the coming years:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            a) Development of a common set of tools to be shared across programs,&#13;
                including:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     i. Targeting systems. The new data available from the national census&#13;
                         and the QUIBB will permit significant advances in geographical and&#13;
                         household level targeting and development of eligibility criteria.&#13;
                         Poverty maps are in the process of being generated at the canton&#13;
                         level, facilitating the more accurate identification of poorer&#13;
                         communities. Moreover, the QUIBB household survey data will allow&#13;
                         for the development of proxy means test indicators that help identify&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                80&#13;
&amp;#12;   household characteristics correlated with poverty and vulnerability&#13;
   which can be used to develop screening criteria for access to various&#13;
   social protection programs. In addition to these proxy means test&#13;
   systems, community-based targeting systems can be shared across&#13;
   programs, with local committees identifying eligible beneficiaries for&#13;
   a range of social protection interventions at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ii. Beneficiary registries. Shared beneficiary registries across programs&#13;
   would improve coordination and efficient use of resources. If well-&#13;
   designed and managed, it would allow having a clear and performing&#13;
   system to monitor beneficiaries, transfers, and graduation&#13;
   mechanisms. Beneficiary registries should be linked directly to&#13;
   payments systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
iii. Common local coordination mechanisms. Typically, each agency or&#13;
   program develops its own local coordination mechanisms, with&#13;
   multiple committees and consultation mechanisms. A common&#13;
   institutional platform would foster synergies between social&#13;
   protection programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
iv. Integrated monitoring and evaluation systems. A national system&#13;
   should integrate the M &amp; E systems of the various social protection&#13;
   programs in place, this includes standardization of core indicators and&#13;
   MIS systems able to compatible with each other, all feeding&#13;
   information on whether national social protection goals are being&#13;
   achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           81&#13;
&amp;#12;b) Linkages between programs. Rather than an isolated set of priority&#13;
   programs, a national social protection strategy seeks to build explicit&#13;
   synergies between programs. This can be achieved by for example by&#13;
   building links between programs that deliver different safety net functions in&#13;
   order to better enable beneficiaries to graduate from poverty. Households&#13;
   enrolled in cash transfer programs could be automatically eligible for&#13;
   national health insurance (or health fee waivers), or , households&#13;
   participating in public works could be linked with income generating projects,&#13;
   microfinance or other asset building programs to help them graduate from&#13;
   safety net programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
c) Intentional scalability. The national social protection system should have the&#13;
   flexibility to respond quickly to the short-term needs resulting from shocks&#13;
   and to scale back down after the period of transitory crisis passes. This&#13;
   includes the contingency planning across all main program areas. Without&#13;
   such readiness, shocks could continue to engender greater vulnerability&#13;
   through negative coping strategies of households as well as recourse to&#13;
   expensive second-best responses by the Government like general price&#13;
   subsidies. The concept of an expandable safety net is much needed given the&#13;
   serious cyclical vulnerabilities affecting poor households in Togo and should&#13;
   feature prominently in the national social protection strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
d) Capacity building. A national social protection system would identify overall&#13;
   needs for capacity building in transversal topics, like needs identification&#13;
   among specific vulnerable groups, targeting, management of in-kind and&#13;
   cash transfers, monitoring and evaluation. These would be shared across&#13;
   programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  82&#13;
&amp;#12;           e) Medium-term expenditure framework. Moving from a project or individual&#13;
               program approach to a national social protection system will require&#13;
               developing an overall financial framework for the sector that prioritizes&#13;
               expenditures and builds a sustainable funding basis for social protection. The&#13;
               medium-term expenditure framework used for other sectors is a well-known&#13;
               tool that would help translate the national social protection strategy into&#13;
               public spending priorities within a coherent multi-year macroeconomic and&#13;
               fiscal framework and integrated into the budget process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.     Institutional Framework in Support of a National Social Protection Strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
134.   Various studies and analyses have pointed out the need for better mechanisms of&#13;
coordination and collaboration in the social protection area. The challenges are significant&#13;
of bringing together a set of programs and policies that implicate several governmental&#13;
ministries as well as varying implementation structures at all levels and a strong role for&#13;
non-state actors (NGOs and the private sector). An effective institutional framework to&#13;
underpin implementation of the national social protection strategy should address&#13;
coordination at the national level, including integration with institutional mechanisms of the&#13;
DRSP and with other sectors, as well as at the local level and with non-state actors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coordination at the central level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
135.   Building a supportive institutional framework at the central level should focus on&#13;
several key functions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Overall policy coherence.&#13;
           b) Coordination of programming between elements of the national social&#13;
               protection strategy.&#13;
           c) Coherence with the DSRP institutional framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              83&#13;
&amp;#12;           d) Collaboration on policy and implementation mechanisms with other sectors,&#13;
               like health, education, and natural disaster management.&#13;
           e) Linkages with budget formulation and monitoring mechanisms at the central&#13;
               level.&#13;
           f) Collaboration with external partners, including international partners, NGOs&#13;
               and the private sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
136.   The existing social protection coordination structure at the central level is&#13;
embedded in the PRSP coordination process. There was a social protection commission&#13;
established in 2008, headed by the Ministry of Employment and the Ministry of Social&#13;
Action and National Solidarity which included a broad set of actors including the sectoral&#13;
ministries in health and education. To rationalize structures, the commission has now been&#13;
replaced by the sectoral committees that were created by decree in November 2011 for the&#13;
preparation of the PRSP. Social protection issues come under the tutelage of the sectoral&#13;
committee â&#128;&#156;promotion et protection sociale, emploiâ&#128;&#157;. The committee is comprised of the&#13;
MTESS as the Chair, and Unicef as the lead donor agency. The other central ministries who&#13;
make up the committee include the MASSN, MDABJEJ, the Ministry of Promotion of&#13;
Women and the Ministry of Sports and Leisure. The ministries of planning and finance also&#13;
can have representation on the sectoral committees to ensure coordination with overall&#13;
planning and budgeting of the Governments. The sectoral committees also include&#13;
participation from civil society, the private sector, department and program heads, and&#13;
other donor agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
137.   The objective of each sector group is not only to work on the preparation of the&#13;
PRSP but also to follow up with the sector policy and development plans of the&#13;
Government in each sector. Specifically, these sectoral committees are tasked with&#13;
monitoring the formulation, validation, implementation and evaluation of sectoral&#13;
strategies. They also monitor the elaboration of program budgets and medium-term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             84&#13;
&amp;#12;expenditure frameworks to develop annual budgets. The committees also oversee&#13;
monitoring and evaluation efforts, including annual progress reports on the achievement of&#13;
goals and objectives (sectoral, PRSP and MDG goals). The sectoral committees serve an&#13;
important donor coordination function as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
138.    There are several advantages to this central level coordination framework. The&#13;
sectoral committees are embedded within the PRSP and its overall coordination structures&#13;
â&#128;&#147; which links social protection closely with the overall economic growth and poverty&#13;
reduction framework of the Government. The committee receives technical support via the&#13;
permanent technical secretariat of the PRSP. The structure of the committee itself reflects&#13;
the multi-sectoral nature social protection and includes all key stakeholders. And, the direct&#13;
linkages to the budget process and the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s priority programs under the PRSP&#13;
increases the opportunities for accessing financing to implement the national social&#13;
protection strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coordination mechanisms at the regional and local levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
139.    The PRSP coordination structure also provides structures at the local level.&#13;
Regional Participatory Monitoring Committees (CRSPs)13 carry out participatory monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of projects and programs at the regional level. The regional committees&#13;
work in close collaboration with prefecture administrations and local civil society&#13;
organizations, as well as local private sector actors, to monitor implementation of the PRSP&#13;
in their regions. Local Participatory Monitoring Committees (CLSPs)14 at the municipal level&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
   Each CRSP is made up of the future Regional Governor, who will serve as chairperson; the Regional Director&#13;
of Development, who will handle the secretarial functions; and representatives of municipal councils,&#13;
prefecture councils, the regional council, directorates of deconcentrated government agencies in the region,&#13;
traditional chiefs, the Regional Chamber of Agriculture, the Regional Chamber of Trade, nongovernmental&#13;
organizations, womenâ&#128;&#153;s development associations, trade union organizations, and Village De velopment&#13;
Committees.&#13;
14&#13;
   Each local committee is made up of representatives of municipal councils, NGOs operating in the&#13;
municipality, womenâ&#128;&#153;s development associations, farmer organizations, traditional chiefs, and Village&#13;
Development Committees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     85&#13;
&amp;#12;are responsible for monitoring operations implemented under the PRSP in their&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
140.   The role that local committees play in social protection is important as a means of&#13;
further decentralizing service delivery and improving the outreach and monitoring of&#13;
critical social protection programs. At the local level, the Community Development&#13;
Committee (CDV), comprised of ComitÃ©s Villageois de DÃ©veloppement (CVD) and Comites&#13;
de DÃ©veloppement de Quartier (CDQ), have been the most operational in terms of&#13;
identifying local priorities and coordinating program implementation. In many rural villages,&#13;
CDVs have created specialized commissions for child protection to detect local needs&#13;
through ComitÃ©s Locaux de Protection (CLP) or ComitÃ©s Locaux contre la Traite (CLT).&#13;
Through these circuits, vulnerable children are identified, registered, and provided support&#13;
(temporary housing, food, clothing, health care, legal and psychosocial assistance) as well as&#13;
efforts toward reinsertion with families where appropriate. These different committees are&#13;
under the tutelage of the head of the village, which in turn depends on the local prefecture.&#13;
These currently are informal social protection structures at the community level. There is no&#13;
legal framework that regulates these local associations. Moreover, these local committees&#13;
require support from technical agencies, including line ministries and implementing&#13;
agencies like AGEFIB, in terms of training, information and materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
141.   Whatever the specific design, it is important that coordination mechanisms be&#13;
performing. Clear lines of communication, responsibilities and reporting functions are&#13;
essential. Typically, a simplified structure is better. Larger committees should meet&#13;
occasionally, leaving more operational sub-committees or restrained groups to carry out&#13;
specific tasks. Most coordination functions breakdown without a clear and specific mandate&#13;
and manual of operations outlining their respective roles. For line agency staff participating&#13;
in coordination mechanisms, it is important that their participation be included in their&#13;
overall job descriptions. And, technical backstopping and financial resources for logistics&#13;
and other inputs (like document production) need to be clearly specified for each level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              86&#13;
&amp;#12;E.     Measuring Results&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Systems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
142.   The success of implementing the national social protection strategy is supported&#13;
through effective monitoring and evaluation systems. M &amp; E systems allow for tracking the&#13;
implementation of policies and priority programs, measuring results and making&#13;
adjustments where necessary. Increasing the use of computerized management&#13;
information systems in social protection programs can improve reporting and can be linked&#13;
with other government databases, for example the national birth and death registry system&#13;
as those systems are further developed. Each social protection program typically develops&#13;
its own M &amp; E system. However, coordination between programs under a national M &amp; E&#13;
action plan can improve the quality and compatibility of information between programs. A&#13;
detailed national M &amp; E action plan should be developed once the national social protection&#13;
strategy is adopted by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
143.   Impact evaluations are in important part of an effective national social protection&#13;
strategy. A number of social protection programs are still in the early stages, where&#13;
impacts are not yet known. Measuring changes in household status and wellbeing as a&#13;
result of social protection interventions helps justify funding. This is particularly true in&#13;
measuring the ultimate impacts on human capital and asset creation among the poor of&#13;
programs that may tend to be viewed as â&#128;&#152;hand-outsâ&#128;&#153;. Priority areas for impact evaluations&#13;
of current SP programs under implementation include: the pilot program of cash transfers,&#13;
INAMâ&#128;&#153;s initial operations in terms of impacts both on program participants as well as health&#13;
services, assessment of the real effects of the grain stock program, and the effectiveness of&#13;
the Green Line (Allo 111) in terms of outcomes for the children assisted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                87&#13;
&amp;#12;Performance Indicators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
144.   While each program may have its more detailed set of indicators, a core set should&#13;
be developed to monitor the overall progress in implementing the national social&#13;
protection strategy. These should reinforce and be consistent with the indicators selected&#13;
as part of the national poverty reduction strategy. The indictors should focus on outputs in&#13;
terms of coverage, targeting, and efficiency as well as outcomes in terms of changes to&#13;
indicators of household wellbeing. Table 12 provides examples of core indicators to be&#13;
considered by area of strategic objective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
145.   Before choosing indicators, the Government should analyze what data are&#13;
available and what data can be collected given resources and feasibility constraints .&#13;
Output indicators should be able to be collected at least annually and aggregated nationally.&#13;
Outcome indicators are more difficult to collect as they often rely on national household&#13;
surveys (which are not carried out annually) or program-level periodic impact evaluations.&#13;
To the extent possible, all indicators should be disaggregated gender, age and geographical&#13;
area as well as reported by vulnerable group (e.g. by distinguishing characteristic like&#13;
disabled, OEV, PVVIH). Relative poverty level of program participants (by poverty quintile)&#13;
should be developed as part of program impact evaluations, to be reported as data permits.&#13;
Baselines and target values should be established for each indicator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                            89&#13;
&amp;#12;F.     Financial Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
146.   Achieving the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s vision of social protection for all will require a&#13;
significant increase in resources to social protection. Total expenditures on social&#13;
protection are quite low as a share of the national budget and as a share of GDP. For&#13;
instance, excluding general price subsidies, safety nets represent only 1.8 percent of the&#13;
general expenditures of the State, or 0.5 percent of GDP (average 2008-2010). International&#13;
partners finance about three-quarters of this amount. The scaling up measures called for to&#13;
meet the specific social protection strategy objectives outlined above will require more&#13;
spending on these priority programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
147.   Estimating the amount of resources needed depends on the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
prioritization of the mix of interventions selected and their scale over the medium term.&#13;
A theoretical costing exercise was carried out based on the general and specific objectives&#13;
outlined in the previous sections. The costs of scaled up coverage of a list of potential&#13;
priority programs was developed and is presented in Table 13. Looking at the list of 14&#13;
possible priority programs, even at initial, not final, stages of scale up, implementing all of&#13;
these would absorb almost of one-third of the current national operating budget and 8% of&#13;
GDP, rising to 53 percent of the national operating budget and almost 15% of GDP if all&#13;
programs were scaled out over the next 8 years. Clearly, this level of effort is not feasible&#13;
for the foreseeable future in Togo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
148.   However, there is significant overlap between and synergies among these social&#13;
protection programs, resulting in a more realistic program mix. The importance of&#13;
developing a national social protection system will result in a more rational and feasible&#13;
program mix than initiating a long list of programs without looking at interactions and&#13;
duplications. In determining what can be financed and how much, several key principals&#13;
should be adhered to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               90&#13;
&amp;#12;           a) It is important that contributory programs and populations that can afford&#13;
               to, pay their own way. Priority should be placed on scarce public resources&#13;
               going to the poor and vulnerable populations. This would, for example,&#13;
               reduce the priority of a program like health insurance to non-poor workers&#13;
               that are non-salaried, where a contributory program would be more&#13;
               appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b) Universal programs increase costs with little poverty impact. For example,&#13;
               providing free health care for the three main illnesses affecting children&#13;
               spreads benefits across the 40 percent of Togolese who are not poor and so&#13;
               should be able to pay for these services. The point of insurance programs is&#13;
               to manage the risk of health care costs. Subsidizing insurance for the poor&#13;
               within a national health insurance framework would be financially preferable&#13;
               to free services for everyone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c) Avoid benefit overlap. To develop a reasonable financial framework, some&#13;
               programs may obviate the need for others. For example, of the 14 programs&#13;
               listed, several entail transfers to poor households, including cash transfers to&#13;
               households with children under five years old, payments to workers in LIPWs,&#13;
               a universal old age pension and food stamps (bons alimentaires) for the rural&#13;
               poor. It is possible that the same households could end up receiving multiple&#13;
               transfers. It would be preferable to identify the total number of households&#13;
               to receive transfers based on resources availability and then determine how&#13;
               to allocate these between different target groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
149.   The Government faces important trade-offs. Trying the reach all of the chronic and&#13;
transitory poor, representing 62 percent of the population will result in very low levels of&#13;
the available resources per capita, diluting effort and diminishing impact. Training more&#13;
substantial resources per beneficiary will necessarily mean developing targeting approaches&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                91&#13;
&amp;#12;that discriminates between poor households. This could be done geographically, or using&#13;
criteria of vulnerability that are more stringent than general poverty levels, for example&#13;
OEVs or very large households, or other households characteristics. For example, one of the&#13;
studies estimated that if cash transfers alone were provided to the estimated 1,519,860&#13;
children living in poverty, a 12,000 FCFA transfer per child per year (one fifth the current&#13;
cash transfer pilot) would be equivalent to about 3.7 percent of the budget (or 1.1 percent&#13;
of GDP). Limiting this to households with children under 5 would further reduce the&#13;
financial requirements to 1.15 percent of the budget and 0.34 percent of GDP. However,&#13;
the low transfer amount could dilute impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;150.    International comparators are instructive in terms of potential cost of programs at&#13;
varying levels of coverage. There are few large-scale social protection programs yet in&#13;
Africa. The largest HIMP public works program (that includes 20 percent of cash transfers to&#13;
beneficiaries unable to work) is Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) which&#13;
reaches about 10 percent of the national population targeted to the poorest rural districts&#13;
at a cost of about 1.2 percent of GDP, reaching 8 million people each year through over&#13;
30.000 LIPW projects. Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s national health insurance program through mutuelles de&#13;
santÃ© has been universalized, reaching 91 percent of households at a public fiscal cost of 1.2&#13;
percent of GDP, a relatively low burden given the coverage because the program requires&#13;
financial contributions from all but the very poorest. Old age social (i.e. non-contributory)&#13;
pensions in South Africa and Lesotho reach 30 percent and 3 percent of the national&#13;
population at a cost of 6 and 3 percent of GDP respectively.15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
151.    What would the cost be of a core program of social protection interventions, or a&#13;
social floor, in Togo? A core set of social protection interventions would ideally include a&#13;
mix of contributory and non-contributory programs, with the non-contributory programs&#13;
focused on specific vulnerable populations:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            a) If Togo currently spends 0.5 percent of GDP on safety nets, a reasonable&#13;
                 fiscal target would be expand this by 1 percent of GDP, which would bring it&#13;
                 closer in line with regional averages and would represent a tripling of current&#13;
                 resources, sufficient enough to significantly scale out some of the more&#13;
                 effective safety net interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            b) On the social insurance side, the fiscal resources needed will rely in great&#13;
                 measure on the contributory policies and parametric reforms associated with&#13;

              groups are in the pilot stage. The high cost per beneficiary will constrain&#13;
              significant scale out of these programs. However, a logical progression of&#13;
              expansion should be budgeted for impact evaluations prove that to be&#13;
              warranted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
152.   Where will the extra resources come from? The possible sources of financing to&#13;
underpin implementation of the national social protection strategy include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           a) Reallocation of existing social protection expenditures. There are several&#13;
              areas where efficiencies or reforms could increase the level of domestic&#13;
              resource available to fund the national social protection strategy. Two stand&#13;
              out for their budgetary implications:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  i. First, a portion of the 2 to 3 percent of GDP that is spent in&#13;
                      Government resources for general subsidies in times of shock could&#13;
                      be reoriented to a more comprehensive safety net system that would&#13;
                      be scalable in times of need. This would save resources, improve&#13;
                      equity through better targeting and heighten positive impacts on&#13;
                      poor and vulnerable households (since the absolute value of the price&#13;
                      subsidy per household is relative small). In summary, shifting from&#13;
                      general subsidies and humanitarian assistance to targeted safety net&#13;
                      programs can save fiscal resources while improving outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             95&#13;
&amp;#12;       ii. The second important source of resources is to stem the drain on&#13;
          fiscal resources of the unsustainable financial parameters of the&#13;
          contributory pension systems of CNSS and CRT. The annual deficits of&#13;
          these systems would absorb a substantial part of all social protection&#13;
          funding and only threaten to worsen if not systematically addressed.&#13;
          Putting the CRT for example on a more sustainable financial footing&#13;
          would free up resources that could be spent to expand other&#13;
          elements of the social protection system, particularly those targeted&#13;
          to more vulnerable populations. Attempts to expand the contributory&#13;
          systems of social insurance, including both pensions and health&#13;
          insurance, outside of the formal sector would additionally crowd in&#13;
          private resources to fund more of the national social protection&#13;
          coverage goals of the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
b) Increase in the share of Government budget allocations to social&#13;
   protection. With a broad range of development priorities, there is keen&#13;
   competition for resources of the national budget. In the past, social&#13;
   protection programs have often been seen as hand-outs or ad-hoc responses&#13;
   to the crisis of the moment. The development of a coherent policy vision for&#13;
   social protection together with a prioritized, targeted and well justified set of&#13;
   core interventions will help justify increased resources from the budget.&#13;
   Moreover, the costs of not spending enough are considerable, both in terms&#13;
   of costly recourse to second-best solutions like general subsidies or the cost&#13;
   in terms of failure to meet national development and poverty reduction goals&#13;
   or the potential dragging effects on future economic growth. The PRSP&#13;
   process provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of a set of social&#13;
   protection measures and expenditures to be monitored as part of the overall&#13;
   performance of the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  96&#13;
&amp;#12;           c) Increased external funding to social protection. It is unlikely that Togo will&#13;
               achieve its social protection coverage goals without an expansion in donor&#13;
               funding to these efforts. This external financing should be channeled through&#13;
               an agreed upon plan to harmonize approaches and shift to more&#13;
               programmatic rather than project funding. The donors should work with the&#13;
               Government to identify sufficient funding within the medium-term&#13;
               expenditure framework for social protection that gives the Government&#13;
               greater predictability through pooling of donor resources into common&#13;
               programs and moving to multi-year commitments of resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
153.   There are political economy dimensions of these financial trade-offs that need to&#13;
recognized. Resources are limited and in the short to medium-term unlikely to be sufficient&#13;
to cover all areas of SP fully. In particular, there are tensions and trade-offs between&#13;
policies supporting the contributory system as opposed to non-contributory systems and&#13;
safety nets, particularly if the contributory system requires large infusions of public&#13;
resources to stay afloat. The financial framework developed to implement the national&#13;
social protection strategy will need to take these tensions and trade-offs into account and&#13;
negotiate between the various societal groups affected to create a social and political&#13;
compact that allows for the protection of vulnerable groups in Togo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               97&#13;
&amp;#12;VI.    Next Steps&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
154.   This report summarizes the current situation of social protection policies and&#13;
programs in Togo and identifies the main issues and components for developing a&#13;
national social protection policy and strategy. Targets should be specified within an overall&#13;
view of expanding social protection efficiently, effectively and fiscally sustainable as&#13;
possible to the greatest number of vulnerable Togolese. These goals and objectives, and the&#13;
priority actions the achieve them, should be harmonized with and integrated within the&#13;
process of finalizing the new poverty reduction strategy of the country.&#13;
155.   As part of the next steps to support national social protection policy and strategy,&#13;
the following set of tools should be developed:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a)   Develop a strategic plan to clearly specify timelines, actions, and institutional&#13;
            responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        b) Develop a medium-term expenditure framework including detailed costing of&#13;
            alternative scenarios. Developing a medium-term expenditure framework for&#13;
            social protection, including the establishment of a social floor, will require&#13;
            outlining a feasible expansion/reform path for a core set of social protection&#13;
            interventions once priorities are determined by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        c) Identify capacity building needs across the full spectrum of social protection&#13;
            policies and programs included under a national social protection strategy in&#13;
            order to strengthen implementation of the strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        d) Elaborate a monitoring and evaluation manual that builds a national social&#13;
            protection information system which can be used for reporting and making&#13;
            adjustments to the strategy and permits aggregating information across the&#13;
            various components of the national social protection strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               98&#13;
&amp;#12;156.    Finalization and validation of the national social protection policy and strategy will&#13;
enable the Government to capitalize on the efforts of recent years to assess its social&#13;
protection needs and pilot promising approaches. In a national workshop held in Lome in&#13;
March 2012, the draft of this report was presented and working groups validated the&#13;
analysis and fine-tuned the general and specific objectives. It was agreed to use this report&#13;
as the basis for the national social protection policy, to be validated in a national workshop&#13;
in mid-2012.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
157.   The formal adoption of a national social protection policy and strategy will&#13;
establish a roadmap for the Government to ensure that it can provide predictable support&#13;
to the poorest, respond to shocks, and help its citizen mitigate social risks, build&#13;
productive assets and increase their access to income and services. Implementation of the&#13;
national social protection policy and strategy, supported by an action plan to be developed&#13;
along with the strategy document, will support the achieving the national goals of reducing&#13;
vulnerability and poverty and promoting broad-based economic growth.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
The Government of Togo has made important advances in the area of social protection.&#13;
Although Togo has had limited social protection programs, the economic shock and natural&#13;
disasters starting in 2008 brought the need for better mechanisms of social protection to the&#13;
fore. The Government response has focused on measures to address the immediate needs of&#13;
the affected populations, while building the analytical base for developing a national social&#13;
protection policy. This report forms part of the overall analytical work prepared to support&#13;
the formation of a national social protection policy. It finds that the most common safety&#13;
net programs are in-kind transfers with limited coverage. It proposes basic elements for the&#13;
Government to take into consideration in developing a national social protection policy and&#13;
strategy and identifies next steps in finalizing the preparation of such a policy and strategy.&#13;
