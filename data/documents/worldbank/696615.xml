1. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. OVERVIEW&#13;
1.1   The consumptions of energy and electricity in Thailand have grown at high rates&#13;
over the past decade and particularly since 1986 due to the strong economic performance&#13;
of the country, arising from rapid industrial growth, and increases in exports, foreign&#13;
investment and tourism. In spite of this rapid growth, however, the energy situation in&#13;
Thailand remains characterized by relatively modest commercial energy consumption in&#13;
relation to the country's development (320 kilograms of oil equivalent (koe) of energy&#13;
consumption per capita compared with an average of 420 koe per capita for all of Asia).&#13;
This includes a relatively high share (35%) of traditional fuels in the final energy&#13;
consumption. The outlook is for rapid growth in commercial energy consumption as the&#13;
economy continues expanding. The primary commercial energy supply is projected to&#13;
grow rapidly at an average annual rate of about 8.0% over the next five years (1996-&#13;
2000) and then at about 5.7% for the next decade.&#13;
1.2   While much of the energy growth in the early 1980s was met by imports, efforts&#13;
in the 1980s to promote the development of indigenous energy resources had a visible&#13;
impact on the pattern of commercial energy consumption: the share of oil fell from about&#13;
90% of total primary commercial energy in 1980 to about 70% in 1990. During that&#13;
period, the shares of indigenous lignite and natural gas grew steadily, reaching 10% and&#13;
16%, respectively, by 1990. Due to the Government's continuing efforts, the share of&#13;
imported oil is anticipated to fall further to about 60% by the year 2005; it is, however,&#13;
unlikely to decline below that level. A major increase in the consumption of imported&#13;
coal (mostly for power generation) is projected in the late 1990s, and coal is expected to&#13;
attain a share of 8% of primary energy consumption after the year 2001.&#13;
1.3   The sectoral composition of energy demand has been marked by a progressive&#13;
increase in the share of the transport sector, which grew 11% p.a. through the 1980s and&#13;
by 1990 accounted for 70% of petroleum products consumption. Electricity consumption&#13;
has increased faster than energy consumption as a whole, averaging 14% p.a. in the last&#13;
three years. As a result, the share of electricity in final commercial energy consumption&#13;
grew from 11% to 15% in the 1980s, with a similar increase in the share of electricity in&#13;
primary energy use from 7% to 11 %.&#13;
B. ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.4   The energy sector in Thailand is operated by a number of well-managed and&#13;
mature public institutions. There are numerous energy-related agencies, spreading across&#13;
many ministries and include several cabinet level committees. Energy policy and&#13;
planning is vested in key governmental organizations. At the highest level is the National&#13;
Energy Policy Council (NEPC) which is chaired by the Prime Minister. The National&#13;
Energy Policy Office (NEPO), the secretariat to NEPC, acts as its operating arm, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
functions primarily as a link between NEPC and the country's energy state enterprises&#13;
and conducts all energy policy work. NEPO is the de facto regulator of the energy sector.&#13;
Other departments involved in energy affairs are:  (a) the Department of Mineral&#13;
Resources, responsible for assessing and preliminary exploration of the country's coal&#13;
and petroleum reserves; (b) the Department of Energy Development and Promotion,&#13;
which conducts research and development and monitors energy sector activities; and (c)&#13;
the Department of Industrial Works, responsible for controlling industrial air and water&#13;
pollution.&#13;
1.5   Energy state enterprises enjoy a large degree of autonomy in the conduct of day-&#13;
to-day operations; however, they are subject to strict government control in all matters&#13;
relating to investment planning and financing.  Because of strict procedures for&#13;
controlling public debt, all loans made by energy state enterprises requiring government&#13;
guarantees must be approved by the Fiscal Policy Office of the Ministry of Finance and&#13;
finally approved by the Cabinet, and subsequently endorsed by the National Debt Policy&#13;
Committee.&#13;
1.6   The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) -- the dominant entity in the&#13;
petroleum sector -- is involved in downstream oil and gas activities; upstream activities&#13;
are carried out by the private sector. PTT is responsible, inter alia, for the purchase,&#13;
transport, processing and sale of natural gas. However, PTT competes with international&#13;
oil companies and has a third of the market share in the distribution and marketing of oil.&#13;
1.7   The power sector is primarily organized around three wholly-owned state&#13;
enterprises. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is the major&#13;
producer of electricity and is also responsible for developing and dispatching the bulk-&#13;
power high voltage transmission system. EGAT has the authority to purchase electricity&#13;
from  cogenerators or other private sources for distribution over the grid.  The&#13;
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)&#13;
own the distribution systems and some subtransmission facilities. MEA and PEA&#13;
distribute electricity purchased from EGAT to the Bangkok metropolitan area and the rest&#13;
of the country, respectively. Highlights of their respective operation are provided in&#13;
Annex 1.&#13;
C. THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
Electricity Demand&#13;
1.8   The power sector in Thailand has grown at a rapid pace over the past two decades.&#13;
The electricity market growth is among the highest in the world and has been fueled by&#13;
the country's high economic growth rate. Considerable progress has been made in&#13;
making electricity widely available, especially in provincial urban areas. Industrial&#13;
consumption has also been growing rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.9   The outlook is for continued rapid growth in electricity demand over the medium&#13;
term.  The latest official demand forecast made by the national Load Forecast&#13;
Subcommittee (composed inter alia of NEPO, EGAT, MEA and PEA) envisages&#13;
continued high load growth related to the expected strong economic performance. Base&#13;
case demand growth rates for EGAT, MEA and PEA for the Seventh (1992-1996), Eighth&#13;
(1997-2001) and Ninth Plan (2002-2006) periods are summarized in Table 1.1. These&#13;
growth rates are considered to be reasonable and achievable. In 1994, Thailand electricity&#13;
demand was 10,709 MW. The demand is forecast to increase to 13,637 MW by the end&#13;
of 1996, to 19,899 MW by the end of 2001, to 26,392 MW by the end of 2006 and to&#13;
34,509 MW by the end of 2011.&#13;

Installed Capacity and Energy Generation&#13;
1.10  As of September 1995, the total installed generating capacity of the Thai power&#13;
sector was 14,672 MW comprising: (a) 2,690 MW hydro power (18%); (b) 6,701 MW&#13;
oil/gas and lignite-fired thermal (46%); (c) 3,094 MW combined cycle (21%); (d) 942&#13;
MW gas turbine; and (e) 1,245 MW purchased power (8%). Total generation from&#13;
EGAT facilities was about 78,880 Gwh in 1995 accounting for almost 100% of the Thai&#13;
total generation with PEA generating only 29 Gwh from its mini-hydro and diesel plants.&#13;
In addition, 742 Gwh were purchased from Laos, Malaysia and other authorities, 131&#13;
Gwh from small power producers and 29 Gwh from others. In 1995, EGAT purchased&#13;
about 6,811 Gwh from the Rayong Combined Cycle Plant (REGCO) of the Electricity&#13;
Generating Company (EGCO) (para. 1.25).&#13;
Losses&#13;
1.11  Total losses in the generation and transmission were approximately 7.7% of total&#13;
power generated in 1995, down from the 1994 level of 8.6%. The level has fallen in&#13;
recent years as problems with power line upgrades have been resolved. About 3.2% of&#13;
electricity generated has been lost in transmission lines and transformers in 1995, better&#13;
than the 1994 level of 4.1 %. Distribution losses as a percentage of power received were&#13;
about 4.5% for MEA and 6% for PEA, an achievement by both organizations which ranks&#13;
with the best performing power utilities in Asia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Transmission&#13;
1.12  As of September 1995, the lengths of EGAT's transmission lines are: (a) 1,201&#13;
circuit-kilometers (ckm) of 500kV; (b) 9,086 ckm of 230kV; (c) 11,539 ckm of 115kV;&#13;
and (d) 296 ckm of 69kV lines. For high voltage substations, there are three 500kV; 43,&#13;
230kV; 124, 115kV; and seven 69kV; totalling 177 substations. The total installed&#13;
transformer capacity, excluding station service and generator unit transformers is 33,855&#13;
MVA. In 1990 the PEA Act was changed to enable PEA to also build 115kV&#13;
subtransmission systems. At present, PEA owns about 47 ckm of 69kV and 722 ckm of&#13;
115kV line; the HV line length is expected to expand to about 3,500 ckm during the Eight&#13;
Plan (1997-2001).&#13;
1.13  PEA's service area is approximately 510,000 sq km, accounting for 99% of the&#13;
total area of Thailand. Its distribution system in its service area in 1995 includes 195,144&#13;
ckm of medium voltage and 254,524 ckm of low voltage distribution lines and 28,126&#13;
MVA of transformer capacity. The growth of PEA's distribution facilities is reflected in&#13;
Annex 2.&#13;
Power Development Plan&#13;
1.14  Meeting increased load demand and improving the electricity transmission and&#13;
distribution systems will require considerable investment, estimated at about Baht 254&#13;
billion under the Eighth Plan. For a long-term profile up to the year 2011, the Power&#13;
Development Plan (PDP) recommends the installation of 33,676 MW of new generating&#13;
capacity, net of the retirement of 2,747 MW of existing power plants. By September&#13;
2011, the sector's total capacity will be 43,918 MW comprising of 11% hydro, 25%&#13;
conventional oil/gas fired, 7% lignite-fired, 11% imported coal-fired, 10% combined&#13;
cycle, 8% gas turbine, and 28% from independent power producers (IPPs) and EGAT-&#13;
TNB transmission lines. EGAT's PDP has incorporated the Government's privatization&#13;
program for the power sector which includes the selling of EGAT's power plants at&#13;
Rayong and Khanom to EGAT's first subsidiary company, the Electricity Generating&#13;
Company Ltd. (EGCO), and the power purchases from IPPs.&#13;
PEA's Investment Program&#13;
1.15  While the service areas of MEA are completely electrified, PEA is still in the&#13;
process of completing the electrification of the more remote areas of the country. To&#13;
date, PEA has electrified 98% of the villages in its service area. And, although PEA sales&#13;
only slightly exceed MEA's, it serves the preponderance of the country's population. At&#13;
the end of FY1995, PEA had more than 9 million customers compared with about 1.8&#13;
million for MEA. Currently, there is a wide disparity in electricity usage between the two&#13;
distribution utilities due, in part, to the intense industrial and commercial development of&#13;
Bangkok, and in part to the lower incomes and more recent development of the outlying&#13;
areas. But, this situation is changing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.16   With village electrification achieving its targets and being essentially completed&#13;
under the Distribution Reinforcement Project (Loan 3798-TH), PEA's investments in&#13;
rural electrification would be substantially reduced. Indeed, much of PEA's investment&#13;
requirements over the next six years will result from the growing demand from industrial&#13;
enterprises in PEA's service territory, and from the need to decrease losses and improve&#13;
reliability. It is these needs which underlie the project. The growth and change in PEA's&#13;
customer base and the Government's initiatives in the power sector are pushing PEA to&#13;
become a very different utility than it has been in the past. PEA thus faces a major&#13;
challenge to upgrade and expand its distribution systems to meet its increasingly&#13;
sophisticated power market. PEA's demand forecast is given in Annex 3.&#13;
1.17   Investments by PEA over the medium-term of about US$5.2 billion will be used&#13;
in part to finance continued distribution of power to the provinces, which began on a&#13;
planned basis in the early 1960s with the formation of PEA. PEA's investments over the&#13;
medium term would concentrate on: (a) expanding and reinforcing distribution networks&#13;
servicing large town centers; (b) providing direct 115kV service in high growth industrial&#13;
areas; and (c) introducing improvements in system operating efficiency through measures&#13;
such as the introduction of automation and control from regional distribution dispatch&#13;
centers. PEA's investment plan is detailed in Annex 4 and summarized in Table 1.2. The&#13;
plan, which is appropriate to the present circumstances, will be updated regularly to&#13;
reflect changes in the amount and geographical location of power demand. Agreement&#13;
was reached during negotiations that PEA would carry out an annual review and update&#13;
of its five-year investment program, discuss this with the Bank, and implement the&#13;
program taking into consideration the Bank's comments.&#13;

D. SECTOR STRATEGY AND ISSUES&#13;
1.18  To meet the rapidly increasing demand for energy and to create an industry&#13;
structure that is both efficient and responsive to commercial incentives, the Government's&#13;
energy strategy calls for the following:&#13;
(a)   A phased privatization and restructuring program covering the principal&#13;
power sector entities, EGAT, PEA, and MEA.  The Government has&#13;
already created a publicly-listed generation subsidiary of EGAT in EGCO.&#13;
A first step has been the categorization of these entities as Excellent State&#13;
Enterprises -- which accords them less government control in their&#13;
operations and increased flexibility in financial management and in&#13;
establishing staffing and compensation structures.  The privatization/&#13;
restructuring program for PEA and MEA is being defined and&#13;
implementation is underway.  The current focus calls for increased&#13;
management and operational reorganization ( paras. 2.6 to 2.8).&#13;
(b)   A substantially increased program of investments in the power sector. The&#13;
Government envisages investments of over US$10 billion equivalent by&#13;
EGAT, close to US$5 equivalent billion by PEA and US$5 billion&#13;
equivalent by MEA during the Eighth Plan (1997-2001).&#13;
(c)   Involvement of the private sector in funding part of the large power sector&#13;
investments.   This stems from the Government's concern about the&#13;
magnitude of power sector investments and the broader implications of&#13;
incurring additional public debt for the purpose. A first tangible step has&#13;
been the public-listing of EGCO (a generation entity affiliated to EGAT).&#13;
A comprehensive private power solicitation program is underway for&#13;
3,800 MW of generation (para. 1.23).&#13;
(d)   A credible and transparent scheme for power sector regulation. The&#13;
existing scheme of regulation has been working satisfactorily, as&#13;
evidenced by operating efficiency and the lack of power shortages.&#13;
However, the need for orienting the regulatory framework to a more&#13;
commercial sector structure which has private investment has been&#13;
recognized (paras. 3.6 and 3.7).  Under the proposed project, the&#13;
Government will undertake a comprehensive study to define the structure&#13;
of the future regulatory system, including functions and procedures. (The&#13;
Terms of Reference for this work are at Annex 5).&#13;
(e)   A thrust towards energy conservation, both through economically efficient&#13;
pricing of resources and through other government directives. Concerned&#13;
with the rapid growth in energy consumption and its impact on the&#13;
economy and the environment, the Government is making serious efforts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
towards fostering energy conservation in all sectors of the economy.&#13;
Some of the initiatives are described in para. 1.19.&#13;
(f)   A stimulation of industrial growth outside of Bangkok, with development&#13;
of infrastructure and granting of tax incentives to promote such growth.&#13;
This would create growth centers in the provincial areas relieving the&#13;
infrastructural strain from Bangkok.&#13;
(g)   Improvement of the efficiency of the distribution system and upgrading&#13;
and automating the system to operate at the higher levels of reliability&#13;
necessary for industry.&#13;
E. DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT (DSM) AND ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION&#13;
1.19  While pursuing a large power development program, the Government has planned&#13;
a thrust towards energy conservation. Its DSM program, supported by the Global&#13;
Environmental Facility (GEF) under the Distribution System and Energy Efficiency&#13;
Project (Loan 3598-TH), has a four-pronged approach: (a) provision of user and&#13;
manufacturer incentives and consumer education to direct practices and attitudes toward&#13;
energy efficient technologies; (b) development of efficiency standards and testing&#13;
capabilities to exercise control and monitor efficiency improvements; (c) development&#13;
and promulgation of building and appliance codes to allow for the enforcement of&#13;
minimum standards; and (d) continued pursuit of technological improvements and&#13;
adaptation to Thai conditions. The project is progressing very well and the current&#13;
demand savings target of about 1,100 MW over the next five years, substantially exceeds&#13;
the original target of about 300 MW.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.20  In the last few years, the Government has placed a strong emphasis on&#13;
environmentally sound and sustainable development. Its 1992 Energy Conservation&#13;
Promotion Act, created an Energy Conservation Fund, financed by surcharges on&#13;
petroleum products and electricity. The Act provides for a rigorous enforcement of&#13;
energy conservation in factories and buildings. The Environmental Quality Act of 1992:&#13;
(a) substantially reorganized the environmental bureaucracy making it more responsive to&#13;
environmental protection; (b) established a Central Environmental Fund for concessional&#13;
financing of environmental projects by the private and public sectors; and (c) recognized&#13;
for the first time the importance of involving Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)&#13;
in development. Gaining from its experience under the Third Power System Development&#13;
Project (Loan 3423-TH), the Government has increasingly emphasized involvement of&#13;
affected people and selected NGOs in environmentally sensitive projects and formalized&#13;
this in the evaluation of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
G. PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION AND REFORM IN THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
1.21  Power sector reform in Thailand began in 1992 with the issuance of the seventh&#13;
National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP). This Plan which covers the&#13;
period 1992-1996, led to the development of a Cabinet resolution for power sector reform&#13;
providing indicative targets for restructuring, corporatization and privatization in the&#13;
power sector. The main objectives of this resolution are to: (a) encourage the operation&#13;
of power utilities as commercial organizations with increased efficiency and flexibility;&#13;
(b) reduce the investment and debt burden of the Government; (c) promote private sector&#13;
participation in the power sector through IPPs and asset divestiture; and (d) utilize&#13;
energy resources efficiently. Progress towards achieving all these objectives over the last&#13;
three years has been substantive. Despite the slippage of some targets in a few instances,&#13;
many of the reform goals specified in the Plan have been achieved or are in advanced&#13;
stages of implementation. Commitment to continued reform is also clearly in evidence.&#13;
1.22  The Bank's operational involvement in the Thai power sector has facilitated&#13;
continuing inputs to the power sector privatization and reform process. The actions&#13;
undertaken are broadly in-line with recommendations in the Bank's study entitled "State&#13;
Enterprise: Improvement, Privatization and Private Sector Participation" (Report No.&#13;
1312-TH). These recommendations include: (a) EGCO to be fully divested and its&#13;
management made independent of EGAT; (b) the pace of introducing IPPs to be&#13;
accelerated; (c) EGAT to be divested into a number of generation companies, with EGAT&#13;
becoming a transmission and power pool company; (d) distribution companies and large&#13;
industrial consumers to be allowed to purchase directly from any power producer; and (c)&#13;
an independent regulatory agency to be set up when the Government's holdings of EGAT,&#13;
MEA and PEA shares are diluted. In regard to PEA, the study recommends: (a) removal&#13;
of subsidies between regions; (b) decentralization of management; and (c) fostering&#13;
competition through split up of the entity and monitoring and comparing performance of&#13;
the individual units.&#13;
1.23  The reform and privatization actions discussed below indicate both the success of&#13;
the Thai power privatization and reform effort in meeting stated objectives and its&#13;
conformance with World Bank recommendations for the sector.&#13;
Private Sector Participation&#13;
(a)   Asset Divestiture. During 1992, EGAT established EGCO as its subsidiary&#13;
company with an issued share capital of Baht 100 million divided into 10 million&#13;
shares of Baht 10 each. On September 30, 1993, EGAT held the entire equity&#13;
with the exception of 15 shares which were issued to EGAT senior management&#13;
to comply with SET regulations. In 1994, a further 186 million shares of Baht 10&#13;
each were issued, all of which are held by EGAT except for one million held by&#13;
the Crown Property Bureau and which increased EGAT's total holding to almost&#13;
192 million shares. In addition to the flotation of additional shares by EGCO&#13;
during the year, it also set up its own subsidiary, the Rayong Electricity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Generating Company (REGCO). In November 1994, a public offering of 204&#13;
million shares in EGCO raised Baht 4.5 billion. Presently, 50% of EGCO is&#13;
publicly listed, EGAT holds 48% of the equity and the Thai Property Crown&#13;
Bureau the remaining 2%. EGAT will further reduce its equity holding in EGCO&#13;
to below 40% by end-1996 by incorporating the Khanom Thermal Station under&#13;
EGCO.&#13;
(b)   Small Power Producers (SPPs) and Co-Generation. The first step taken by the&#13;
Government towards increasing private sector participation was allowing co-&#13;
generators and SPPs to sell power to EGAT. In 1994, a Co-generation Agreement&#13;
was signed with a private company to bring on line a new 60 MW facility.&#13;
Currently, there are 20 SPPs with a total installed capacity of 669 MW mostly&#13;
utilizing traditional fuels such as bagasse, rice husk, wood, etc.&#13;
(c)   Independent Power Producers (IPPsa.  To meet the ever increasing power&#13;
requirements, Thailand launched what could be the world's largest competitive&#13;
IPP solicitation program.  EGAT announced the first request for proposals on&#13;
December 15, 1994 to purchase 3,800 MW from IPPs in two stages. Stage I, for&#13;
1,000 MW during the years 1998-2000, and Stage 2, for 2,800 MW in the years&#13;
2001 and 2002. As of December 1995, 104 registered IPPs/bidders have formed&#13;
into 32 consortiums and have submitted 50 IPP proposals totalling 39,067 MW.&#13;
The evaluation of IPP proposals has been completed.&#13;
Enterprise Commercialization/Corporatization&#13;
(a)   The  two  distribution  entities, PEA  and  MEA, have  both  prepared&#13;
corporatization/privatization action plans.  The PEA action plan has been&#13;
approved by the Cabinet.  It is now in the phase of defining detailed&#13;
implementation plans to manage the transition from the existing organizational&#13;
structure to the future commercial organizations. PEA will be transformed over a&#13;
4-5 year period from a centrally controlled government agency, to regionally&#13;
decentralized corporate subsidiaries under a holding company structure.&#13;
(b)   EGAT has been classified as an "Excellent State Enterprise". PEA is to achieve&#13;
this status by mid-1996. The excellent state enterprise status requires: (i) return&#13;
on assets employed greater than 6%; (ii) labor cost below 10% of total costs; and&#13;
(iii) annual productivity increases equal to or greater than 2%. Achievement of&#13;
the excellent state enterprise status provides management with the authority to&#13;
devise and implement a suitable staffing and compensation system. This step has&#13;
had a major impact in improving management incentives and is crucial to&#13;
achieving a smooth transition to a commercial operating status.&#13;
(c)   EGAT's fuel purchases from PTT are now made on a sound commercial basis. In&#13;
the past, EGAT has been obliged to purchase all of its oil from PTT. Under the&#13;
Government's privatization program, EGAT was allowed in 1993 to purchase oil&#13;
on the open market, on a trial basis. PTT won the competitive tender for the trial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
purchase, which was deemed a success. While the agreement for commercial&#13;
heavy oil purchases from PTT has been completed, a natural gas agreement is still&#13;
being negotiated and would be completed in 1996.&#13;
(d)   Plans for organizational restructuring of EGAT have been approved. These plans&#13;
while were effective by April- 1996 envisage the creation of six business units (i.e.&#13;
profit centers), and five operating units (i.e. cost centers). The business units are:&#13;
thermal generation; transmission; engineering; construction; mining and&#13;
maintenance. The operating units are: governors office and internal audit; hydro&#13;
power plants; administration; accounting and finance; policy and planning and&#13;
new business ventures. Asset restructuring for the creation of profit centers is in&#13;
progress. The business units will be corporatized in line with the broad sector&#13;
restructuring strategy of the Government. All transactions between business units&#13;
will be conducted on the basis of transparent transfer prices. Once this structure&#13;
is developed on a sound commercial footing, the business units will be either&#13;
wholly or partially privatized. The progress on privatization will depend on the&#13;
absorptive capacity of domestic capital markets.&#13;
Power Sector Restructuring&#13;
(a)   In February 1996, the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) submitted and&#13;
obtained approval by the Cabinet for a medium-term structure for the Electricity&#13;
Supply Industry. This structure shown in Annex 6 envisages the formation of a&#13;
central purchasing agency comprising the existing EGAT transmission system and&#13;
hydro power plants. This entity will be an independent corporation. The thermal&#13;
plants under EGAT will be corporatized as an independent generation subsidiary.&#13;
All transactions between the central purchasing agency and power suppliers will&#13;
be based on fully-dispatchable power purchase agreements (PPAs) in order to&#13;
ensure productive efficiency in the power system.&#13;
(b)   The uniform tariff policy has required that retail sales of MEA and PEA be priced&#13;
uniformly throughout the country. EGAT's differential tariffs to MEA and PEA&#13;
have been the vehicle of subsidization from the urban to the rural areas. It has&#13;
been the Government's intention to eliminate the cross subsidy scheme from&#13;
EGAT's tariffs before its privatization. A Study on the Rationalization of Bulk&#13;
Supply Tariff to MEA and PEA is being undertaken with Bank financing under&#13;
the Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project (Loan 3884-TH). The study would&#13;
provide a model bulk power agreement with MEA and PEA, the first step in&#13;
formalizing MEA and PEA contracts that would eliminate cross subsidies. NEPO&#13;
expects the revised bulk tariff structure to be introduced in 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II&#13;
H. BANK LENDING FOR THE SECTOR&#13;
Experience with Past Loans&#13;
1.24 The Bank has made 24 loans to Thailand for power, of which five have been made&#13;
to PEA (three for rural electrification and two for distribution reinforcement), one has&#13;
been made to MEA for improvement of its distribution system, and 18 have been made to&#13;
EGAT and its predecessor for financing the expansion of electricity generation and&#13;
transmission facilities. Three of the loans to PEA have been fully disbursed; while the&#13;
rest are under supervision: (a) the Distribution System Upgrading Project (Loan 3404-&#13;
TH) disbursed more slowly than expected at the initial phase of the project because of a&#13;
change in consultants and delays in land procurement for substations; and (b) the&#13;
Distribution System Reinforcement Project (Loan 3798-TH) has been delayed by about a&#13;
year in its implementation because of initial delays in finalizing consultancy contracts&#13;
and problems with design and procurement of transmission lines. The overall progress in&#13;
the implementation of MEA's Distribution System and Energy Efficiency Project (Loan&#13;
3598-TH) is satisfactory and about half of the work is now completed. Of the 18 loans to&#13;
EGAT, 17 have been fully disbursed and the only on-going project is the Lam Takhong&#13;
Pump Storage Project (Loan 3884-TH) which was approved by the Bank's Board on May&#13;
9, 1995 and signed on September 8, 1995.&#13;
1.25  PEA has completed three Bank-financed projects for rural electrification: the&#13;
Accelerated Rural Electrification Project (Loan 1527-TH, completed in 1983), the Second&#13;
Accelerated Rural Electrification Project (Loan 1871-TH, completed in 1987), and the&#13;
Provincial Power Distribution Project (Loan 2312-TH, completed in 1989).  The&#13;
corresponding Project Completion Reports (PPAR #6269 dated June 13, 1986, PPAR&#13;
#7756 dated April 1, 1989, and PPAR #9016 dated September 14, 1990) show that the&#13;
project objectives were largely accomplished. The design and procurement delays being&#13;
experienced in the two ongoing projects with PEA (Distribution System Upgrading and&#13;
Distribution System Reinforcement) have emphasized the need to procure land well in&#13;
advance of design and procurement activities. There is also a need for appointing&#13;
consultants early in the project cycle.  The shift to the development of 115 kV&#13;
subtransmission, to be followed by the introduction of the associated SCADA systems&#13;
under the proposed project, will require PEA to sharpen its skills in project management.&#13;
The proposed project addresses these issues through: (a) sufficiently advanced action by&#13;
PEA in recruiting consultants; (b) incorporation of computerized project preparation and&#13;
management techniques (the Bank has recently provided special training in the use of&#13;
CPM project management techniques); (c) more rational packaging of procurement&#13;
maximizing turnkey type installation; and (d) advance action in land acquisition.&#13;
1.26 With specific regard to PEA, the Bank's association has contributed to PEA's&#13;
institutional development, focusing particularly on improving: (a) strategic planning; (b)&#13;
project planning and implementation; (c) materials management; (d) distribution system&#13;
planning; (e) electronic data processing; and (f) manpower development. Findings and&#13;
recommendations of an institutional development study completed under Loan 2312-TH&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
were implemented with good results, with one noteworthy example being PEA's&#13;
corporate planning system, which has developed into an effective tool for articulating&#13;
corporate responsibilities and objectives and managing corporate activities. Under Loan&#13;
3404-TH consultancy services regarding institutional development resulted in&#13;
recommendations related to organizational structure and staffing, some of which have&#13;
already been implemented. A feasibility study for the privatization of PEA, included&#13;
under Loan 3798-TH, proposed a new organizational structure that would facilitate&#13;
PEA's transformation to a commercially operated company by FY98.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.27  The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS), which was presented to the Board on September 24, 1994. Among the priority&#13;
areas for Bank assistance identified in the CAS is the development of physical&#13;
infrastructure. The proposed project directly supports this objective by: (a) supporting&#13;
substantial investments in the distribution infrastructure in the south of Thailand; and (b)&#13;
aiming to improve the efficacy of proposed massive investments in distribution&#13;
infrastructure in the whole country by modest investments in automating its operation and&#13;
control. The Government's power sector strategy is also consistent with the Bank's power&#13;
sector policy, specifically with regard to its commitment to improve sector performance&#13;
through efficiency improvements, corporatization and encouraging private investment.&#13;
1.28  Through sustained involvement over a number of years, the Bank has contributed&#13;
significantly to the development of the Thai energy sector. With a modest level of&#13;
borrowing, the Government is keen to continue this involvement. Bank advice and&#13;
assistance have helped the Government effectively address the issues of: (a) least-cost&#13;
investment planning; (b) supply- and demand- side management and resource pricing;&#13;
and (c) power sector restructuring and privatization. Much further work remains to be&#13;
done in actual implementation of the proposed sector strategies. In parallel with its&#13;
technical inputs, the Bank's continued operational involvement is needed to exercise&#13;
significant influence on Government policies towards evolution of the sector in an&#13;
economically efficient, financially sound and environmentally sustainable manner, and&#13;
for its orderly progress towards reform, restructuring and privatization.&#13;
1.29  Through rationalizing its interfacing arrangements with EGAT, the proposed&#13;
project would contribute towards an orderly regionalization and subsequent privatization&#13;
of PEA. Bank's association with PEA under the project would enhance implementation of&#13;
the recommendations of the PEA Privatization study (completed under Loan 3798-TH)&#13;
that would restructure and transform PEA into a commercially operated company by&#13;
1998. Further, the study on Regulatory Framework would, for the first time&#13;
systematically and in depth, investigate the issues and options in regulating the Thai&#13;
energy sector and define the regulatory framework most suited to the sector's increasingly&#13;
commercial nature and one that would involve private investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. THE BORROWER&#13;
2.1   Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) is a state enterprise wholly owned by the&#13;
Kingdom of Thailand and comes under the direct supervision of the Ministry of the&#13;
Interior. PEA was established by the Provincial Electric Authority Act of 1960 to&#13;
consolidate the development of the country's electricity distribution systems outside of&#13;
Bangkok. The Act gives PEA the authority to generate, acquire, transmit, and distribute&#13;
electric energy and conduct business related to electric energy and other business&#13;
incidental to those activities that benefit PEA.&#13;
2.2   PEA serves customers over a large area. At the end of FY95, PEA had over 9&#13;
million consumers and nearly 30,000 employees. In FY95, over 99% of PEA's energy&#13;
requirement was purchased from EGAT, with the remainder purchased from Department&#13;
of Energy Affairs (DEA) and generated from its own mini-hydro and diesel plants.&#13;
A. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
2.3   As a state enterprise, overall guidance, policy and support are provided to PEA&#13;
by the Government through a government-appointed Board of Directors. The Board of&#13;
Directors is comprised of a Chairman (who has the position of Director General,&#13;
Department of Local Administration within the Ministry of Interior) and nine other&#13;
members who include both senior officials of the government agencies and departments&#13;
concerned with power distribution, and representatives from the private sector. The&#13;
Board terms are four years and members can be re-appointed. The Governor of PEA is&#13;
an ex-officio member of the Board as well as PEA's chief executive officer. In addition&#13;
to appointing the Governor, the Board also approves the appointments of all Advisors,&#13;
Experts, and any management at the level of Department Manager or higher. The Board&#13;
approves the PEA budget and reviews and approves financing and capital expenditure&#13;
plans before they are submitted to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Council of&#13;
Ministers. The Board also approves purchases in excess of Baht 20 million.&#13;
2.4   Within PEA, decision making on projects, project management, capital&#13;
expenditures, and personnel are highly centralized. The Governor appoints project&#13;
managers, approves each new permanent position established, reviews the progress of all&#13;
projects and resolves project management issues, and approves all purchases above Baht&#13;
5 million.&#13;
2.5  In line with the Government's overall plan for the commercialization and eventual&#13;
privatization of the electricity sector, PEA is reviewing its organizational structure. This&#13;
re-evaluation is being conducted through a study (Feasibility Study for the Privatization&#13;
of PEA) being implemented under the Distribution System Reinforcement Project (Loan&#13;
3798-TH) with a view to the possible division of PEA into separate regional companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
B. RESTRUCTURING OF PEA&#13;
2.6   The restructuring of PEA is intended to lead to its creation as a limited liability&#13;
corporate entity (i.e. corporatization) followed by eventual privatization.  These&#13;
objectives and related policy goals vis-a-vis electricity development are defined in the&#13;
1992-1996 Seventh National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP). PEA is&#13;
soon to acquire the intermediate target of being classified as an Excellent State&#13;
Enterprise, which would give it the authority to devise and establish a suitable&#13;
compensation and staffing system.  More importantly, the Excellent State Enterprise&#13;
status requires entities to achieve the minimum commercial benchmarks.&#13;
2.7   To adequately define a privatization strategy and begin implementation, PEA has&#13;
over the last two years initiated a comprehensive effort to commercialize and corporatize&#13;
its operations. A high-level privatization sub-committee was established to oversee the&#13;
activity.  Preliminary studies were undertaken in 1994, with the feasibility study&#13;
submitted in February 1995. The feasibility study articulated a phased restructuring&#13;
strategy for PEA and recommended a priority focus on operational and functional&#13;
streamlining. In particular, organizational restructuring and human resource and skills&#13;
upgrading were seen as crucial to any successful move towards privatization. The senior&#13;
management reviewed the feasibility study and requested additional detail on&#13;
implementation.  PEA working groups working with the consultant prepared a set of&#13;
action plans by end-1995. The implementation actions were developed to achieve the&#13;
following strategic vision for PEA:&#13;
(a)   PEA will decentralize the day-to-day management of operations to its four&#13;
regional distribution areas (i.e. regions).  This phased progression will&#13;
begin with the creation of business units with fully allocated costs (i.e.&#13;
cost-centers), followed by their transition to fully independent profit&#13;
centers by end- 1997;&#13;
(b)   Creation of a PEA Holding Company structure with the regional entities as&#13;
separate corporations under PEA. The Holding Company would provide&#13;
central services and policy guidance.   These central services could&#13;
include: coordination in tariff setting and power system management;&#13;
certain specialized engineering services; and assistance in financing of&#13;
major projects and overall debt management; and&#13;
(c)   Separation of non-core functions as separate subsidiaries with the view of&#13;
eventual spin-off if possible.   The non-core functions are pole&#13;
manufacturing and construction.  These subsidiaries should ultimately&#13;
compete for PEA business with the transitional arrangement of PEA&#13;
contracts to enable commercial operation.&#13;
2.8   It has been recommended that the restructuring of PEA be carefully phased and&#13;
sequenced with the intention of building important commercial capabilities in order to&#13;
achieve a successful transition to the private sector.  It is envisaged that the above&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
transformations could take up to 3-4 years to be adequately implemented. Annex 7&#13;
provides details on the implementation program and an indicative implementation&#13;
schedule.  Agreement was reached at negotiations that PEA  would restructure its&#13;
organization according to an agreed action plan as follows: no later than (a)September 30,&#13;
1996 for the operational decentralization of PEA distribution areas; (b)September 30,&#13;
1998, for the transition to fully independent utility profit centers; and (c) September 30,&#13;
1999, for the transition to a Holding Company Structure with regional utility subsidiaries.&#13;
Any revision of the said plan shall be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank.&#13;
C. STAFFING AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT&#13;
2.9   PEA's management and staff are professional and well-qualified.  As of&#13;
December 1995, PEA employed 30,961 persons, 1,974 at various managerial levels and&#13;
28,987 non-managerial positions consisting of engineers, accountants, technicians, and&#13;
administrative and other skilled workers. PEA has a young workforce, matching closely&#13;
the general population; about 40% (the largest percentage of employees) of the staff are&#13;
between the ages of 25 to 34. About 70% of the staff have received some form of higher&#13;
education, with 7% being university graduates. The 1995 mix of headquarters staff&#13;
(5,573) and field personnel (25,388) is 18:82 times. PEA's staff composition and&#13;
educational qualifications are presented in Table 3.1.&#13;

2.10   Due in large part to the rapid growth of PEA in terms of number of customers and&#13;
electricity sales, the number of consumers per employee consistently increased from 247&#13;
in FY91 to 292 in FY95; annual energy sales per employee increased from 0.727 Gwh to&#13;
1.22 Gwh, respectively. PEA's employee population has increased 8% in the last five&#13;
years. Of these, the headquarters staff has grown 0.1% compared to 20% for field staff.&#13;
With the fast pace of growth of field offices, ultimately the deployment and utilization of&#13;
staff resources will impact PEA's operational efficiency. It would be extremely difficult&#13;
for PEA to keep up with this demand while updating or improving its business process to&#13;
support additional demands of flexibility and responsiveness. Furthermore, operations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
that worked well with a mostly residential customer base, served by a relatively small&#13;
employee population in the past, has become burdensome and bureaucratic as PEA is&#13;
now faced with a growing industrial base and a large employee population.&#13;
2.11  PEA's management has recognized the need for slower employee growth as&#13;
indicated by the drop in annual increases from about 17-19% in the early 1980s to annual&#13;
increases averaging 4% in the late 1980s and early 1990s. PEA's employee population&#13;
has now peaked and as its revenues taper from their current 17% increase from FY94 to&#13;
FY95, and as PEA, in complying with its Excellent Enterprise status, becomes more&#13;
efficient, it is clear that additional growth in workforce will not be needed for the near&#13;
future.&#13;
Training&#13;
2.12  Training within PEA is primarily the responsibility of the Training Center for&#13;
technical, non-technical, and management training and the PEA Vocational School,&#13;
which is responsible for developing "hotline" technicians. The Center, which has a&#13;
permanent staff of 102 employees (31 of whom are full-time instructors), is organized&#13;
into six sections including an audio visual section, training documentation section,&#13;
electrical system training, general equipment or mechanical training section,&#13;
administrative section and a section responsible for training evaluation. The Center&#13;
provides training at the head office, conference locations, local offices, universities,&#13;
technical institutes and at PEA's Training Center in Nakorn Chaisri District. While PEA&#13;
sends staff for external training, both in Thailand and abroad, much of PEA training effort&#13;
is in the technical areas; insufficient attention is given to supervisory and management&#13;
training and to staff development. Further, more employees need to be exposed to&#13;
training as the overall number of employees undergoing training (778 in FY94) seems&#13;
disproportionately low when compared to the total employee population (31,300). PEA&#13;
is currently reviewing its training role and developing a training plan that would increase&#13;
the number of trained staff, decrease administrative positions and increase instructors and&#13;
course developers.&#13;
D. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
2.13  PEA uses four geographic regions - Central, South, North and Northeast - as the&#13;
basis of its four administrative regions. The three regions of South, North and Northeast&#13;
have roughly equal loads while the Central region, where much of the demand growth is&#13;
now occurring, is projected to serve more than half the total load by FY96. With the&#13;
rapid growth experienced by PEA during the past five years, the number of connections&#13;
provided by the utility has increased from 6.6 million in 1990 to 8.5 million in 1994, for&#13;
an average annual growth of 7%. The annual investment program increased even more&#13;
rapidly, from Baht 4,906 million in FY90 to Baht 9,305 million in FY94, or about 20%&#13;
per year. The relatively low level of capital investment in the late 1980s has created the&#13;
need for sharply increased capital expenditures in the early 1990s. Accordingly, PEA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
will make the much needed upgrading and expansion of its distribution system, which&#13;
should prepare it for the expected continued high growth rates of the near to medium&#13;
term.&#13;
2.14  Throughout its history, PEA's market and development emphasis has been on&#13;
electrifying the country and uniting parts of its network. Village electrification projects&#13;
and other distribution system expansion projects to achieve those ends have played a&#13;
prominent role in all of PEA's project plans. The electrification process (reaching 98% of&#13;
villages and about 20% of families still to be connected), while still ongoing, is nearly&#13;
complete. PEA's system development is now increasingly dedicated to meeting the&#13;
requirements of growing high-density load centers. PEA has found it necessary to&#13;
develop its own 115 kV system to serve large load centers reliably and efficiently.&#13;
2.15  PEA operates its facilities satisfactorily. It conducts regular maintenance within&#13;
stipulated intervals, and the standards observed for major maintenance work are&#13;
satisfactory. Power losses for the institution as a whole amount to about 5% of electricity&#13;
purchases, which are low when compared to those recorded for other countries in the&#13;
region.&#13;
2.16  PEA has a good record in project cost control, implementation and management.&#13;
It has been a Bank borrower since 1978 and has been a recipient of five loans. It is&#13;
familiar with the Bank's procurement guidelines and processes tenders and awards&#13;
contracts equitably and expeditiously.&#13;
E. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
Accounting&#13;
2.17  PEA's accounting system conforms to modem power utility practices. Head&#13;
Office Accounting Division has a staff of about 75 persons, of which 25 have accounting&#13;
degrees (although no one is a CPA) while the Finance Division includes 15 accountants&#13;
(one is a CPA). While the staff is qualified and well motivated, the lack of CPAs will&#13;
present a problem as reporting requirements become more structured and timely.&#13;
2.18  Most of PEA's accounting applications have been computerized.  Financial&#13;
statements are developed at each area office and regional centers and sent to the Head&#13;
Office Accounting Division on computer and diskette where they are consolidated.&#13;
Monthly reports are produced by the Accounting and Finance Divisions and financial&#13;
statements are summarized monthly and reported to the Board of Directors who provide&#13;
them to the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Corporate accounting has the responsibility for&#13;
designing the chart of accounts, developing accounting systems, controlling accounting&#13;
procedures, financial and cost analysis and preparing financial statements. Consolidation&#13;
of financial accounts is only partly computerized and an integrated accounting system&#13;
would help PEA achieve greater efficiency in its operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.19  The budget process has been operating satisfactorily. The Budget Division is&#13;
responsible for preparing PEA's annual budgets for its capital and operating expenditures,&#13;
and prepares periodic reports to compare actual results against budgeted amounts.&#13;
Additionally, it prepares the financial analysis and projections; negotiates with the Fiscal&#13;
Policy Office, the NESDB, MOF, and foreign and local financial institutions; controls&#13;
disbursement of loans and government subsidy, and studies terms and conditions of&#13;
loans.&#13;
2.20  PEA's billing and collection system  is adequate.  PEA has over 9 million&#13;
customers from which revenues are collected. The customer bills are produced at the area&#13;
offices and sent to the provincial offices for distribution. Revenues are collected at the&#13;
provincial office with the assistance of outside bill collectors. Collections are deposited&#13;
into local banks and transferred daily (computerized, on-line transfer) to the Krung Thai&#13;
Bank in Bangkok. Industrial customers are charged 15% annual late fee on revenues not&#13;
paid within 15 days after the bill is delivered and service is cut off to non-paying&#13;
customers if the bill is unpaid after the next seven to ten days.&#13;
Audit&#13;
2.21   PEA has an Internal Auditing Department which reports directly to the Governor.&#13;
The Department, consisting of seven divisions and one section, has a staff of about 140&#13;
auditors and accountants who review the accounts of each regional office and of the head&#13;
office every three months. Each audit focuses on analysis, evaluations, suggestions and&#13;
observations involving financial management and accounting operations and managerial&#13;
controls. These audits are submitted to the Director of Internal Audit but only problem&#13;
findings are brought to the attention of the Governor.&#13;
2.22  PEA's Internal Auditing reviews the annual Action Plan and the audit&#13;
performance. Work is performed in conjunction with the Office of the Auditor General to&#13;
assess improvement in efficiency, economy and effectiveness.  In addition to the&#13;
performance audit, the Auditor General performs the external audit in accordance with&#13;
internationally accepted auditing procedures as well as guidelines set up by the Office of&#13;
the Auditor General. The submission of the reports to the Bank has always been timely&#13;
and the auditing arrangements are satisfactory. As provided for under previous Bank&#13;
loans, agreement was reached with PEA, at negotiations, that it would submit to the Bank&#13;
the audited financial statements within six months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
Reporting and Management Information System&#13;
2.23  PEA has an extensive review and approval process related to decision-making,&#13;
performance management and information reporting approaches.  The management&#13;
information reporting at PEA has evolved along traditional paths typical of a large,&#13;
government enterprise and reflects PEA's culture of a primarily "top down" centralized&#13;
approach to management control and decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
2.24 A Management Information System (MIS) is currently being implemented which&#13;
would include the fully computerized customer service system (including billing,&#13;
collections, and customer-related work orders), finance and accounting system, fixed&#13;
asset and inventory management system, and personnel management system. It is also&#13;
developing a transmission and distribution system management (TDSM) and an&#13;
engineering design and analysis system, financed under the Bank's Distribution&#13;
Upgrading and Distribution System Reinforcement Projects (Loans 3404-TH and 3798-&#13;
TH), respectively. The Bank-financed systems are expected to improve PEA's project&#13;
management, monitoring and reporting capabilities.&#13;
2.25  PEA's computer systems, established for its individual applications, have not yet&#13;
been integrated. Work is currently underway on an electronic data processing master&#13;
plan, and PEA has commissioned a consulting study to help achieve integration of its&#13;
various systems.&#13;
Insurance&#13;
2.26  PEA carries adequate insurance protection against fire for buildings and their&#13;
contents. No third party liability insurance is carried. This is the general practice in most&#13;
public enterprises in Thailand and given the characteristics of the risk for PEA is&#13;
acceptable. Insurance policies are reviewed and updated once a year. It was agreed, at&#13;
negotiations, that PEA would continue to make provisions satisfactory to the Bank to&#13;
provide insurance against such risks and in amounts consistent with appropriate practice.&#13;
Taxes&#13;
2.27  In accordance with regulations applicable to state enterprises, PEA is liable to&#13;
remit to the MOF a proportion of its net income. As advised by the Government's Budget&#13;
Bureau, PEA has been remitting taxes each year since September 30, 1992 at a level&#13;
which rose from 15% of net income to the current level of 30%. To achieve greater&#13;
independence from government regulation, PEA applied for "Excellent State Enterprise"&#13;
status in May 1993. PEA complied with a number of criteria to attain the status,&#13;
including being able to maintain a net income at a level that will permit remittance to the&#13;
MOF at the commercial rate of 30%. PEA expects to become an "Excellent State&#13;
Enterprise" in 1996.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.1   The main objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) improve through&#13;
automation the efficiency and reliability of PEA's distribution network and strengthen its&#13;
operational capabilities; (b) upgrade the distribution system in the south of Thailand to&#13;
meet demand growth efficiently and at least cost; (c) strengthen PEA's engineering and&#13;
management capabilities through the integration of its Geographical Information System&#13;
(GIS) with the proposed Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system; (d)&#13;
help rationalize PEA system's interfacing arrangements with EGAT, an important step&#13;
towards its regionalization and subsequent privatization; and (e) help investigate the&#13;
issues and options for the regulatory framework for the energy sector. In addition, during&#13;
the tenure of the project, the Bank would assist PEA in its efforts towards restructuring&#13;
and subsequent corporatization.  The achievement of project objectives would be&#13;
monitored through specific performance indicators (para. 3.12 and Annex 12). The&#13;
components of the proposed project are:&#13;
(a)   Distribution Automation System comprising: (i) six control centers with&#13;
SCADA facilities in PEA Central Region Areas 1, 2 and 3, Southern&#13;
Region Area 1, Northern Region Area 3, and consolidation reporting&#13;
facilities in PEA's Head Office; (ii) about 2,100 remote-controlled&#13;
distribution line switching equipment; (iii) some 1,500 fault indicators,&#13;
150 remote terminal units and 75 Ultra High Frequency (UHF)&#13;
communications links; and (iv) construction of six control centers and&#13;
modification of about 150 existing substations;&#13;
(b)   Upgrading Distribution in South Thailand comprising: construction of&#13;
about 680 km of 115 kV transmission lines and about 20 associated&#13;
1 15/22/33 kV substations (total capacity about 1,350 MVA);&#13;
(c)   Consulting Services for: (i) detailed design and project management of the&#13;
Distribution Automation System including training of PEA technical staff;&#13;
and (ii) detailed design and project management of Upgrading Distribution&#13;
in South Thailand; and&#13;
(d)   Technical Assistance for: (i) rationalization of PEA's interfacing&#13;
arrangements with EGAT; and (ii) study of issues and options for the&#13;
regulatory framework for the energy sector.&#13;
Distribution Automation System&#13;
3.2   Thailand's Seventh National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP)&#13;
recognizes: (a) power system efficiency improvement; and (b) strengthening system&#13;
operational and service capability as two important factors that would contribute to the&#13;
achievement of a reliable electricity supply, vital for a sustained high economic growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
rate. Following a detailed feasibility study by consultants (Annex 22, Ref. 2) PEA and&#13;
the Government have decided on introduction of automated distribution practices that&#13;
would facilitate: (a) collection of operational and statistical data on the distribution&#13;
network that would help improve efficiency and lower operating costs; and (b) exercising&#13;
of remote control of operational devices in the network that would help reduce outage&#13;
times and unsupplied energy to consumers. The overall distribution automation project&#13;
involves the establishment of Distribution Dispatching Centers (DDC) in each of PEA's&#13;
12 administrative areas and a System Management Center (SMC) at PEA's head office in&#13;
Bangkok. Its first phase, which constitutes the proposed project, covers 28 of Thailand's&#13;
fastest growing provinces, and involves construction of DDC's for the Central Region&#13;
Areas 1,2, 3, the Southern Region Area 1 and the Northern Region Area 3. The proposed&#13;
project would involve installation of about 1,600 Remote Control Switches (RCS) in a&#13;
total of about 1,072 trunk feeder circuits with a combined length of about 62,000 km.&#13;
The switches would be controlled by about 156 RTUs installed in 156 substations.&#13;
Communications between the RCSs and the substations will be carried out on a UHF&#13;
radio point-to-multipoint network with an estimated 60 master radios and 15 repeaters.&#13;
Communications between the substations and the DDCs will be carried on the microwave&#13;
systems currently being established by PEA under a different project. The SMC would&#13;
be provided with Energy Management System, Data Compilation System and&#13;
Administration Applications software. The DDCs will be provided with SCADA,&#13;
Distribution Management Systems (DMS) software, the GIS and Automated Billing&#13;
System (ABS). A schematic of the system is given in Annex 8. Agreement was reached&#13;
at negotiations that PEA would ensure that the communication system required for&#13;
communication between control centers and substations shall be installed and be fully&#13;
operational in time to meet the commissioning requirements of the distribution&#13;
automation system.&#13;
Upgrading Distribution in South Thailand&#13;
3.3   An in-depth feasibility study undertaken by consultants (Annex 22, Ref. 3)&#13;
determined that progressive extension of 115kV lines and construction of new&#13;
115/22/33kV substations (instead of expanding distribution from existing substations)&#13;
would be the least-cost distribution option for the south of Thailand, and indeed for high&#13;
growth areas in rest of the country.  The substations under the project would be&#13;
substantially standardized in design, and would norrnally commence service with one&#13;
incoming 115kV line, one 25 MVA (rural areas) or 50 MVA (urban areas) transformer,&#13;
outdoor 115kV switching arrangement and indoor 22/33kV switchgear with five radial&#13;
feeder outlets. For consumers requiring a high degree of reliability, measures taken&#13;
would include looping 115kV lines, duplicating substation transformers and/or providing&#13;
load transfer facilities at 22/33kV. The 115kV lines under the project would utilize&#13;
concrete poles, and would be routed along existing roads thereby eliminating new right-&#13;
of-way requirements. Pertinent project data are given in Annex 9. Distribution beyond&#13;
the substation 22/33kV bus would be outside the scope of the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
3.4   Provision has been made in the project for consulting services to assist PEA in&#13;
engineering, design, procurement and construction supervision of: (a) the Distribution&#13;
Automation component (including integration of the GIS and the DMS and extensive&#13;
training of PEA staff), amounting to about 450 staff-months (SM); and (b) the component&#13;
for Upgrading Distribution in South Thailand, amounting to about 45 SM. Consulting&#13;
services for the first phase of the Distribution Automation System (about 30 SM), which&#13;
includes basic design and preparation of bid documents, have already been engaged&#13;
following the Bank guidelines.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
3.5   Rationalization of Interfacing Arrangements with EGAT. The main objectives of&#13;
this TA are to investigate the technical and economic aspects of transmission and sub-&#13;
transmission development in Thailand. This would provide a framework for the rational&#13;
division of ownership of transmission and sub-transmission facilities between EGAT and&#13;
PEA, an important step in the proposed regionalization of PEA into four companies and&#13;
the contemplated evolution of a separate national Transmission Company (terms of&#13;
reference are at Annex 10). This TA will be financed out of the Japanese PHRD grant&#13;
and consulting services (amounting to about 50 SM), have already been engaged&#13;
following the Bank guidelines. Agreement was reached at negotiations that PEA, under&#13;
the supervision of NEPO, would complete by no later than June 30, 1997 a study, under&#13;
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, into the technical and economic aspects of&#13;
power transmission and subtransmission development in Thailand with a view to&#13;
providing a framework for the rationalization of transmission and subtransmission&#13;
facilities of EGAT and PEA; and review the study with the Government, EGAT and the&#13;
Bank and based on that review, by no later than December 31, 1997 develop an action&#13;
plan for the rationalization of the interfacing arrangements between EGAT and PEA&#13;
taking into account the Bank's recommendations as presented during the course of the&#13;
review.&#13;
3.6   Regulatory Framework for the Energy Sector. Currently, Thailand does not have&#13;
an independent regulatory body for the energy sector. The regulatory role performed by&#13;
NEPO has, so far, enabled the sector to function satisfactorily. However, with: (a) the&#13;
strong emphasis placed by the Government on mobilizing private capital to finance the&#13;
massive investments in the sector; and (b) the Government's plans to restructure the&#13;
sector and its entities and move them towards corporatization and eventual privatization,&#13;
the time is opportune to investigate the need for change and to review issues and options&#13;
for the evolution of a regulatory framework that would be able to shoulder the greatly&#13;
increased burden and the more complex nature of regulation in the future. Apart from&#13;
this, the regulation would need to be transparent and done in a way (through a set of&#13;
legally binding, transparent, fair and practical rules and regulations) that would induce&#13;
private entities to invest in the sector, and that would assure them their investment and&#13;
future income and market entry and exit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
3.7   The main objectives of the consulting study (amounting to about 40 SM) would&#13;
be to: (a) review the current regulatory framework for all facets of the energy sector (but&#13;
with emphasis on the power sector) and the proposed plans of the Government for&#13;
restructuring the various sub-sectors; (b) assess the needs for regulation of the energy&#13;
sector in the long-term in the light of the Government's objectives to attract private sector&#13;
participation, including the degree and depth of competition desired in the sub-sectors; (c)&#13;
investigate altemative regulatory arrangements and their merits and demerits; (d) define&#13;
the scope, functions and organizational arrangements for the most optimum regulatory&#13;
framework; and (e) assess the most suitable time frame and the stages through which the&#13;
current regulatory system could evolve into the most optimum system. Terms of&#13;
reference for the TA are at Annex 5. Agreement was reached at negotiations that PEA,&#13;
under the supervision of NEPO, would complete by no later than December 31, 1997, a&#13;
study, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, reviewing the regulatory&#13;
framework of the energy sector in the light of increasing private participation in the sector&#13;
and identifying issues and actions to reform.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.8   PEA will be fully responsible for the implementation of the physical components&#13;
of the project. Two project teams, each headed by a Deputy Governor, have been formned&#13;
for coordinating and managing the activities of the two project components, respectively.&#13;
In view of the complex nature of the Distribution Automation component, elaborate&#13;
organizational arrangements have been made for implementation as indicated in Chart 2.&#13;
The project teams will draw on: (a) design support from PEA's Engineering/Planning,&#13;
Civil/Architecture, and Procurement departments; (b) accounting support from PEA's&#13;
Economic/Budget and Accounting/Finance departments; and (c) construction supervision&#13;
support from PEA's Construction, Service and Transport departments, and from the&#13;
regional offices. The teams will have extensive consulting support throughout project&#13;
implementation. Installation of the Distribution Automation System facilities, as also of&#13;
the transmission lines and substations for Upgrading Distribution in South Thailand, will&#13;
be undertaken through single-responsibility turnkey contracts. All transmission lines&#13;
under the project will be pole-mounted, and will be routed along roads where PEA has&#13;
right-of-way, thus avoiding potential right-of-way problems. PEA is well advanced in&#13;
the procurement of land plots for the substations. The project implementation schedule&#13;
will, therefore, not be affected by land acquisition problems. PEA has prepared a Project&#13;
Implementation Plan in line with Bank guidelines (Annex 22, Ref. 1). The bar charts for&#13;
implementing the various project components are given in Charts 3 and 4. The project&#13;
would be implemented over the 1996-1999 period. The above implementation&#13;
arrangements are appropriate for timely execution of the project and are satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
3.9   The consulting studies for the regulatory framework for the energy sector (para.&#13;
3.6) and for the rationalization of interfacing arrangements with EGAT (para. 3.5) would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
be implemented by PEA under the supervision of the National Energy Policy Office&#13;
(NEPO).&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.10   Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in terns of&#13;
physical execution and financial reports were agreed with PEA, at negotiations. It was&#13;
also agreed that PEA will furnish quarterly progress reports.  An Implementation&#13;
Completion Report (ICR) will be drafted by the Bank not later than six months after&#13;
closing of the loans and agreement was reached at negotiations that PEA would assist in&#13;
its preparation. PEA will adopt a plan for the operational phase of the project. PEA will&#13;
also prepare and make available to the Bank its own evaluation report, including a&#13;
summary report which will be attached unedited to the ICR. The evaluation would assess&#13;
the project execution and initial operation, its costs and benefits, the Bank's performance.&#13;
its own performance of the obligations under the Loan Agreements, and the extent to&#13;
which the purposes of the Loans were achieved.&#13;
Supervision Plan and Key Project Performance Indicators&#13;
3.11         Supervision of this project will extend over a period of three years, 1997-&#13;
1999. The key issues that would be focused upon are: (a) periodic reviews of PEA's&#13;
investment plan in keeping with changes in the economic scenario; (b) compliance with&#13;
financial covenants to assure the financial health of PEA while undertaking a large&#13;
investment program; (c) progress in the restructuring of PEA's organization; and (d)&#13;
technical supervision of physical implementation of the project components. The Bank&#13;
missions, accompanied with ESMAP staff as necessary, would also assist the&#13;
Government in: (a) addressing legal and regulatory framework issues for the energy&#13;
sector; and (b) rationalization of transmission arrangements between PEA and EGAT.&#13;
Supervision of the project would require expertise in power engineering, economics,&#13;
financial analysis, corporate restructuring and energy sector regulation. Three missions&#13;
annually for a period of three years (normally coinciding with supervision and&#13;
preparatory missions for ongoing and future Bank-assisted projects, respectively) are&#13;
foreseen for adequate supervision of this project. The total estimated staff inputs are: (a)&#13;
power engineer, economist and financial analyst -- 24 staff-weeks; (b) corporate&#13;
restructuring -- 5 staff-weeks; (c) regulatory framework -- 5 staff-weeks; and (d) legal&#13;
expert -- 4 staff-weeks (see Annex 11 for details).&#13;
3.12  The achievement of project objectives would be monitored during and after&#13;
project implementation through specific project performance indicators (see Annex 12).&#13;
The performance indicators in relation to the Distribution Automation component would&#13;
be: (a) System Average Interruption Frequency Index; and (b) Customer Average&#13;
Interruption Duration Index. In regard to Upgrading Distribution in South Thailand, the&#13;
performance indicator would be the Transformer Utilization Factor for each of the 20&#13;
substations under the project. PEA's performance would (apart from monitoring of&#13;
compliance with financial covenants) be monitored in terms of: (a) Gwh sales per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
employee; (b) customers per employee; (c) overall system loss; (d) time for bid&#13;
evaluation; and (e) actual annual changes in the organization structure versus planned&#13;
changes. In addition to the perfornance indicators, target dates have been defined to&#13;
monitor progress in the implementation of the physical and technical assistance&#13;
components of the project.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENT&#13;
3.13  A detailed Environmental Impact Examination (including route surveys) of the&#13;
transmission lines and substations to be constructed for Upgrading Distribution in South&#13;
Thailand has been conducted by PEA. This has concluded that neither the transmission&#13;
lines (which will be constructed in open areas along the right-of-way of existing roads of&#13;
the Highway Department), nor the substations will encroach on ecologically sensitive&#13;
forest areas, or affect any agricultural land. The Distribution Automation component of&#13;
the project does not involve construction of any new transmission lines or substations.&#13;
The equipment that would be procured would be introduced in existing lines or installed&#13;
in control centers in existing PEA substations or district office premises. The project, as&#13;
a whole, would, therefore, have no adverse impact on the environment and has thus been&#13;
classified under Category B.&#13;
3.14  The total land area required for the construction of the 21 substations is about 33&#13;
hectares. Land plots for the substations are being purchased by PEA from the owners&#13;
through a process of negotiations. Ten plots have already been purchased; negotiations&#13;
have been completed for 4 plots; negotiations for 4 plots are in progress; 3 plots&#13;
belonging to the Government have to be alloted to PEA. Agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that procurement of land required for the construction of substations will not&#13;
involve will not involve expropriation, involuntary resettlement or rehabilitation or&#13;
compensation.&#13;
D. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.15  The total financing required by PEA  for the proposed project (including&#13;
capitalized interest during construction) is estimated at about US$347 million, with a&#13;
foreign exchange component of about US$173 million. Details of the cost estimate are&#13;
presented in Annex 13. Costs are at January 1996 price levels and are based on estimates&#13;
prepared by the consultants and updated by PEA. Physical contingencies have been&#13;
assumed at about 10% of the base cost. Price contingencies are estimated on the basis of&#13;
escalation factors of 5% for the local cost components and 2.2% for the foreign cost&#13;
components following Bank guidelines. Table 3.1 summarizes the cost estimates for the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;

E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.16    Table  4.2  summarizes the  expected  financing  sources for the  project.   Bank&#13;
financing would account for about 29% of the project cost (including interest during&#13;
construction) and about 58% of its foreign exchange component. The Bank loans would&#13;
be: (a) US$67 million in single currency, US$ denominated, fixed interest loan, with a 3-&#13;
6 year disbursement period and a 12-15 years maturity; and (b) US$33 million equivalent&#13;
in currency pool loan payable in 17 years, including five years of grace at Bank standard&#13;
variable interest rate. PEA would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks for its&#13;
loans, which would be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand. Other borrowings would&#13;
include local commercial bank loans and bonds for 5-7 year duration, with interest rates&#13;
of about 10% (para. 4.23).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.17 All contracts financed by the Bank would be awarded on the basis of International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines,&#13;
published in January 1995 and revised in January 1996. Pre-qualification of bidders&#13;
would be carried out for the supply and installation of equipment and systems for the&#13;
distribution automation component.&#13;
3.18   A procurement plan for the project shall be furnished to the Bank for its review&#13;
and approval, prior to the issuance of any invitations to prequalify for bidding or to bid&#13;
for contracts. Procurement of all goods shall be undertaken in accordance with such&#13;
procurement plan as shall have been approved by the Bank. The invitation to prequalify&#13;
or bid for each contract estimated to cost US$10 million equivalent or more shall be&#13;
advertised in accordance with the procedures applicable to large contracts under&#13;
paragraph 2.8 of the Bank's procurement guidelines. The bid documents would follow&#13;
the text of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. The Bank's Standard Form of&#13;
Contract would be used for the consultancy contracts. In the evaluation of bids for goods&#13;
procured following ICB procedures, a domestic price preference margin equal to 15% of&#13;
the CIF bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes,&#13;
whichever is less, will be allowed for domestic manufactures. Prior Bank review of bid&#13;
documents and approval of contract awards would be mandatory for all contracts&#13;
expected to cost the equivalent of US$1.0 million or more. This would cover about 95%&#13;
of total contract value. Consulting services financed by the Bank would be awarded in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants. All consultancy&#13;
contracts, except: (a) contracts with consulting firms expected to cost less than $100,000&#13;
equivalent each; and (b) contracts with individual consultants expected to cost less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent each, will be subject to prior review by the Bank. The provisions&#13;
of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or approval of budgets,&#13;
shortlists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and&#13;
contracts, shall not apply to: (a) contracts for the employment of consulting firms&#13;
expected to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent; or (b) contracts for the employment of&#13;
individual consultants estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent each. However,&#13;
these exceptions to prior Bank review shall not apply to: (a) the terms of reference of&#13;
such contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a&#13;
critical nature (as reasonably determined by the Bank); and (d) amendments to contracts&#13;
of consulting firms raising the contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or above or&#13;
amnendments to contract for the employment of individual consultants raising the contract&#13;
value to US$50,000 equivalent or above. The total number of procurement packages is&#13;
foreseen to be 9 (Annex 14). A total of about 585 staff-months of consulting services&#13;
will be engaged under about 4 contracts (paras. 3.4 to 3.7).&#13;
3.19  Substations, transmission lines and distribution automation systems would be&#13;
implemented through single responsibility supply and install contracts. Conductors for&#13;
transmission lines would be fabricated locally out of aluminum ingots. The ingots would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
be procured through ICB procedures and financed from the Bank loans. Local fabrication&#13;
of conductors will not be financed from the Bank loans.&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.20  The Bank loans would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures for&#13;
imported equipment and materials; (b) 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally&#13;
manufactured items procured through ICB; (c) 70% of local expenditures for materials&#13;
and equipment procured locally; and (d) 100% of total expenditures for consulting&#13;
services. For all equipment and material contracts, disbursements would be made against&#13;
full documentation. As the number of contracts is small and manageable, Statement of&#13;
Expenditures (SOE) procedures would not be followed nor would a Special Account be&#13;
opened. However, PEA will ensure that each withdrawal application would not be less&#13;
than US$50,000 equivalent.&#13;
3.21  Annex 15 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loans and the&#13;
standard profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia. Considering the advanced&#13;
stage of preparation by PEA with consultants already in place for the Distribution&#13;
Automation component, the proposed loans is expected to be disbursed slightly faster&#13;
than indicated by the standard profile. The project is expected to be completed by June&#13;
30, 2001 and the closing date for the loans would be December 31, 2001.&#13;

(3-year average)&#13;
4.2    During the period FY90-94, PEA's energy sales grew at an annual average of about&#13;
17%, from 17,805 Gwh in FY90 to 32,296 Gwh in FY94. This very high growth rate was&#13;
due to the country's overall economic expansion in the period, PEA's extensive rural&#13;
electrification program, and the rapid industrial development, especially in the provinces&#13;
immediately adjacent to Bangkok. The growth also reflects the Government's policy of&#13;
regional diversification by encouraging economic growth outside the greater Bangkok&#13;
metropolitan area.&#13;
4.3    The sizable sales volume increase of the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s enabled&#13;
PEA to earn net income in FY90, which more than doubled in FY91 and continued to&#13;
increase by more than 20% per annum through FY93. Largely because of the rapid volume&#13;
growth, but also because PEA's capital investment program has been low in relation to its&#13;
sales growth, PEA's financial indicators have been excessively sound. The rate of return&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
(ROR) on net revalued fixed assets in operation averaged 13% in FY90-94. The self-&#13;
financing ratio, which was 100% in FY92 and averaged 66% throughout the period, was 56%&#13;
in FY94.&#13;
4.4   PEA has been extremely profitable because operating expenses have been maintained&#13;
at a level of about 88% of revenues on average throughout the period, as increases in major&#13;
expense items such as purchased power, operating and maintenance expenses, and&#13;
depreciation have kept pace with electricity sales. PEA's profitability was further improved&#13;
by its relatively low and declining level of financing charges. Interest charged to operations&#13;
of Baht 1.2 billion, which represented 4% of operating revenues in FY90, decreased to Baht&#13;
0.9 billion or 2% in FY94. The reason for this is not only a low level of capital investments&#13;
in the period but also PEA's reliance on internally-generated funds for more than 50% of its&#13;
funding requirements, and substantial use of low cost borrowings through OECF and KfW&#13;
(Germany) for a significant portion of its debt.&#13;
B. PRESENT FINANCIAL POSITION&#13;
4.5   In FY94, PEA experienced an increase in electric energy sales of 12% over FY93. Of&#13;
the total amount of revenues from electricity sales of Baht 52 billion, Baht 11.4 billion&#13;
(22%) came from residential customers, Baht 36.7 billion (71%) from business and industrial&#13;
categories and Baht 3.6 billion (7%) from other customers. The increase in operating&#13;
revenues was mainly attributed to the increase in electricity demand though offset by a&#13;
reduction in the average tariff by about 1.2% from Baht 1.62/kwh in FY93 to Baht 1.60/kWh&#13;
in FY94. Net income in FY94 dropped slightly by Baht 26 million, because of significant&#13;
increases in remittances to Government (77%) and foreign exchange losses (35%).&#13;
4.6   In accordance with regulations applicable to state enterprises, PEA is liable to remit a&#13;
proportion of its net income to the MOF at a level determined at year's end according to the&#13;
needs of the National Treasury. The remittance level of 15% of net income throughout the&#13;
period FY87-92, was increased to 21% in FY93, and was again raised to 30% in FY94, as&#13;
PEA seeks to conform to the Government's requirements for "Excellent State Enterprise"&#13;
status.&#13;
4.7   PEA's foreign exchange gains and losses on loan repayments arise as a result of&#13;
differences in exchange rates between year end and at the date of loan repayments. As of&#13;
September 1994, PEA's foreign long term debts of Baht 23.7 billion (net of current&#13;
maturities) were denominated 80% in Japanese Yen, 10% in US Dollars, 7% in German&#13;
Marks and the rest in other foreign currencies. The losses on foreign exchange which PEA&#13;
charged to its FY94 operations increased from Baht 385 million in FY93 to Baht 521 million&#13;
largely due to the substantial appreciation of the Japanese Yen.&#13;
4.8   As a result of the foreign exchange system adjustment initiated by the Government on&#13;
November 2, 1984, PEA revalues foreign currency loans as of September 30 of each year,&#13;
and spreads the loss over the remaining terms of the loans to a deferred foreign exchange&#13;
adjustment account. The amount written off to deferred foreign exchange adjustment account&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
increased by 7% over FY93. Even with the increase in PEA's long tern debt as a result of&#13;
the inclusion of the deferred foreign exchange account, its debt to equity ratio remained well&#13;
below the covenanted ratio set in previous Bank agreements at 60:40.&#13;
4.9     PEA's financial position has exceeded the range of acceptable perfornance due to an&#13;
underleveraged financial condition and the huge amounts of cash accumulated over the years.&#13;
The self-financing ratio based on a three-year average capital investment has remained at a&#13;
consistently high level while the rate of return on the basis of a revalued rate base has been&#13;
no less than 11% throughout the five-year period. PEA's capital structure has been more&#13;
than sound. The debt to total capitalization ratio has fallen dramatically through the five year&#13;
period from 1.2 in FY90 to 0.6 in FY94 while the debt service coverage has increased from&#13;
2.0 in FY90 to 4.5 in FY94. The current ratio has also increased from 1.6 times in FY90 to&#13;
2.7 times in FY94.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL OUTLOOK&#13;
4.10   The financial projections throughout the period FY95-2001 show a rationalization of&#13;
PEA's financial performance that would correct the overperformance of the past five years.&#13;
Projections of PEA's financial performance for the period FY95-2003 and the assumptions&#13;
underlying  these projections are presented  in Annex  17.  Key  financial indicators are&#13;
presented in Table 4.2 below:&#13;

4.11   PEA's capital investment expenditure averaged Baht 4.5 billion per year in the Sixth&#13;
Plan (FY87-91) and is expected to substantially increase to Baht 17.4 billion in the Seventh&#13;
Plan (FY92-96) and to Baht 22.7 billion in the Eight Plan (FY97-2001). During the next five&#13;
years alone, PEA will need to finance about Baht 142 billion to fund capital investment&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.12  While PEA's financial prospects continue to be bright, the challenge for PEA in the&#13;
near term is to be able to finance a high level of capital investments contemplated until FY99&#13;
and at the same time maintain an acceptable level of self-financing and rates of return to be&#13;
achieved for the next several years. These higher investments are necessary to rehabilitate&#13;
and upgrade the existing system, as well as to expand the system to include currently&#13;
unelectrified and partially electrified villages. PEA's current financial strength should allow&#13;
it to absorb and finance this growth.&#13;
4.13  PEA's projections show that an acceptable level of self-financing can be achieved in&#13;
FY98-01, the period of heavy capital expenditures, provided PEA is allowed to raise its&#13;
retail tariffs during the period and that EGAT's tariff to PEA, which has been recently&#13;
increased, remains at current levels. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the&#13;
Government that it will take measures, including but not necessarily limited to setting tariff&#13;
levels, so as to: (a) generate funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 25% of&#13;
the annual average of its capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred for that&#13;
fiscal year, the previous fiscal year, and the next following fiscal year; and (b) achieve a rate&#13;
of return on net revalued fixed assets in operation of not less than 4%.&#13;
4.14  The financial projections are based on the assumption that PEA would be able to&#13;
increase its average tariffs in FY95 by 7% from Baht 1.6014/kWh to Baht 1.7097/kwh and&#13;
marginally by about 1% to 1.5% in FY96 to FY01. The price of purchased power has been&#13;
projected to increase at the average rate of 6% from an average price of Baht 1.03/kwh in&#13;
FY94 to Baht 1.09/kwh in FY95. Any further tariff increases by EGAT to PEA, would&#13;
require commensurate increases in the PEA tariff. Any increases in PEA's costs would also&#13;
require appropriate changes in the retail tariff. A review of the existing bulk supply tariff and&#13;
recommended suitable tariffs for bulk supply to PEA and MEA is being examined in a study&#13;
on the Rationalization of Bulk Supply Tariff to MEA and PEA (para. 4.20) financed by the&#13;
Bank under the Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project (Loan 3884-TH).&#13;
4.15  Energy sales in FY95 increased by 17% from FY94 or from Baht 52 billion to Baht&#13;
65 billion. Operating income which dropped slightly in FY95 is expected to drop sharply in&#13;
FY96.  Contributing to this significant decline in operating income are the projected&#13;
increases in: (a) operating and maintenance expenses, and depreciation as PEA continues to&#13;
operate a rapidly expanding capital investment program; and (b) Government remittances on&#13;
the basis of 30% of PEA revenues against the previous level of 21%, in accordance with its&#13;
deregulated status. As a result, the operating ratio, which has been at levels of around 86-&#13;
88% in the past is expected to be 92% in FY95 and at its highest level of 98% in FY96.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
4.16  PEA's projected financial ratios are expected to be satisfactory. The key liquidity&#13;
indicators (debt to total capital, self financing, debt service coverage and current ratios) are&#13;
projected to edge back into the range of acceptable financial performance during the near&#13;
term. The debt service coverage ratio would range between 1.5 to 4.5 times throughout the&#13;
projected period. The capital structure would also be more than adequate with long term debt&#13;
at its peak not exceeding 1.3 times equity or a comfortable ratio of 56/44. PEA's current&#13;
debt control test provides for Bank review of borrowing when the debt to equity ratio exceeds&#13;
1.5 times or 60/40 level. To ensure that measures are taken to maintain PEA's strong capital&#13;
structure, during negotiations, agreement was reached with PEA and the Government that&#13;
further debt would not be incurred if such additional debt would raise its total long term&#13;
indebtedness to more than 1.5 times its total capitalization. Under previous loans, PEA was&#13;
required not to contract short- and medium-term debt (debt which matures within five years)&#13;
in excess of 15% of its total debt outstanding. PEA has always complied with this covenant,&#13;
and at negotiations, it was agreed that compliance of this limit would be continued under the&#13;
proposed loans.&#13;
4.17  PEA's rate of return (ROR) on revalued net fixed assets in operation (revalued each&#13;
year according to an index published by the NESDB) is projected to be 10% in FY95 and&#13;
between 5.3% to 6.6% throughout the projected period. The ROR. which peaked at 14% in&#13;
FY93-94, has been consistently maintained at high levels in the past largely because PEA's&#13;
capital investment program has been low in relation to its sales growth. The substantial&#13;
decline in the projected ROR is largely because of: (a) the increased depreciation charges,&#13;
which in the past have averaged 8.8% of revenues but are projected to increase to an average&#13;
of 10.5% of revenues; (b) increased remittances which rose from a level of 15% of net&#13;
income (until FY93) to the current and projected level of 30%; and (c) the expanding rate&#13;
base, resulting from the substantial increase in investment beginning in FY96 when the&#13;
average rate base would grow by 23% and to peak in FY97-98 when the rate base would&#13;
grow by as much as 36% in each year. The projected ROR would, however, comfortably&#13;
meet the covenant of a minimum of 4% under the previous Bank loan (Distribution System&#13;
Reinforcement Project, Loan 3798-TH).&#13;
D. TARIFF LEVELS AND STRUCTURE&#13;
4.18  PEA and MEA receive power from EGAT at wholesale rates at several of their grid&#13;
substations. The bulk supply tariff is on the basis of long-run marginal cost pricing but takes&#13;
into account equity, social and development considerations as well as the financial needs of&#13;
the three utilities, EGAT, PEA and MEA. The tariff to PEA and MEA as currently applied,&#13;
comprises a flat energy charge. There is no demand charge or charge for variation depending&#13;
on time of use, and consequently, the tariff does not reflect the costs of supply and is&#13;
inadequate to give correct signals to PEA and MEA to improve their load factor, load shape&#13;
and power factor or foster conservation. The current tariff for bulk supply for MEA is Baht&#13;
1.47/kwh, whereas the tariff for PEA is Baht 0.96/kwh, although the actual cost of supply to&#13;
PEA is greater than the cost of supply to MEA. The difference in the tariff to the two utilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
is intentional, so that the urban consumers subsidize the rural consumers, the retail tariff for&#13;
all consumers in Thailand being uniform.&#13;
4.19  The current tariff structure, which is given in Annex 18, was revised as of December&#13;
31, 1991; before that it had remained essentially without change during the previous five&#13;
years but for a small reduction in 1987. With effect from December 1992, the Government&#13;
put in place an automatic adjustment clause, by means of which the retail tariff is adjusted&#13;
monthly as EGAT's costs change for fuel, taxes, foreign exchange and demand side&#13;
management. The electricity tariffs are set by a tariff setting committee composed of EGAT,&#13;
PEA, MEA, MOF, NEPO and NIDA. The committee meets monthly to determine the&#13;
automatic adjustment factor, reviews the relative rates periodically to ensure that they&#13;
accomplish the required cross-funding among the utilities, and prepares recommendations to&#13;
the NEPC on the proposed tariff increases during the tariff setting period every three years. It&#13;
was agreed during negotiations that under the loans, PEA would review by April 30 of every&#13;
year the adequacy of its tariffs to produce the required self-financing, rate of return and&#13;
debt/equity ratio obligations.&#13;
4.20  The adequacy and appropriateness of the tariff structure in Thailand is currently under&#13;
review through a study: "Rationalization of Bulk Supply Tariff to MEA and PEA" being&#13;
undertaken by the three electric utilities: EGAT, PEA and MEA in close coordination with&#13;
and under the guidance of the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO). The study aims to: (a)&#13;
review the current and future (under a restructured power sector) financial requirements of&#13;
the three utilities and propose a rational basis for setting tariffs consistent with their financial&#13;
objectives; (b) review the existing bulk supply tariff and recommend suitable tariffs for bulk&#13;
supply to PEA and MEA that would reflect actual supply costs and future structure of the&#13;
power sector; (c) review the need for a uniform national tariff and suggest a retail tariff&#13;
structure based on economic principles and equity considerations, including the necessary&#13;
transparent subsidy mechanism; (d) suggest a suitable time frame and transition strategy for&#13;
implementation; (e) suggest cost-effective metering arrangements for measuring and&#13;
integrating demand and energy for bulk supply to PEA and MEA; and (f) recommend draft&#13;
power purchase agreements for bulk supplies. Work on the study has commenced and&#13;
consultants have now been hired. The study is expected to be completed in July 1996.&#13;
E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;

4.22   The proposed project, including interest during construction, represents 5% of PEA's&#13;
total investment program during the FY95-00 period. The proposed Bank loans of US$67&#13;
million and US$33 million equivalent are expected to meet about 28.8% of the cost of the&#13;
project but only 1.5% of PEA's total financing requirements for the period. During the&#13;
FY95-00 period, PEA expects to meet 34% of its capital requirements from internally&#13;
generated funds and 10% from consumer contributions and customer deposits. In addition to&#13;
the Bank loans, it will need to borrow funds totalling 54% of its total cash requirements. It&#13;
should have no problem borrowing these funds from the sources which traditionally have&#13;
supplied it (para. 4.4) as it has already has commitments for a large portion of its borrowing&#13;
needs over the period. Its debt/equity ratio and debt service coverage ratio suggest that it&#13;
should have no difficulty absorbing and servicing its anticipated debt (para. 4.16).&#13;
4.23   PEA has customarily relied largely on soft foreign loans from the Overseas Economic&#13;
Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Germany,&#13;
the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED), the Canadian International&#13;
Development Agency (CIDA) and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&#13;
(OPEC) Fund for International Development. It also has several outstanding loans from the&#13;
Bank including two on-going loans which have not yet fully disbursed. PEA expects to&#13;
continue depending on foreign borrowing from these sources to finance the foreign cost of its&#13;
projects. No difficulties have arisen in the past in PEA's obtaining sufficient financing for its&#13;
projects; no difficulties are expected in obtaining sufficient cofinancing for this project.&#13;
Excluding CIDA loans which are interest free, interest rates on foreign loans from sources&#13;
other than the Bank range from 1.7% to 4% p.a. In addition, PEA borrows domestically from&#13;
commercial banks at current market rates.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5.1   The continuing surge in electricity demand in the PEA service territory has made&#13;
it imperative for PEA to expand and upgrade its system to deliver power to new areas&#13;
while maintaining acceptable levels of efficiency, service quality and reliability. The&#13;
project forms an important part of PEA's least-cost expansion program and its&#13;
implementation would contribute to the country's continued economic growth.&#13;
Distribution automation would bring in its wake numerous benefits to PEA's operations;&#13;
the principal quantifiable benefits would stem from improvement in operational&#13;
flexibility and significant reduction in unsupplied energy which would translate into&#13;
substantial economic benefits, especially to industrial and commercial consumers. In&#13;
supporting investments in the distribution infrastructure in South Thailand, the project&#13;
would contribute significantly to its capability to meet demand growth in an&#13;
economically efficient manner.&#13;
5.2   Through laying the framework for rationalizing PEA's interfacing arrangements&#13;
with EGAT, the proposed project would contribute towards an orderly regionalization&#13;
and subsequent privatization of PEA. Further, the study on regulatory framework for the&#13;
energy sector would, for the first time systematically and in depth, investigate the issues&#13;
and options in regulating the Thai energy sector and define the regulatory framework&#13;
most suited to the sector's increasingly commercializing nature.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Distribution Automation&#13;
5.3     The two project components, Distribution  Automation  and Upgrading&#13;
Distribution in South Thailand are being undertaken in different parts of the country and&#13;
are thus not inter-related. Hence, the economic analyses of the two components are&#13;
carried out separately. The Distribution Automation Project is dealt with in detail in the&#13;
consultant's report (Annex 22, Ref. 2), while a discussion of potential benefits is&#13;
presented in Annex 19. A summary of benefits, indicating those that are quantified in the&#13;
economic analysis, is presented below:&#13;
(a)   Reduction in customer hours lost (unsupplied energy) due to faster&#13;
restoration of service following faults (quantified);&#13;
(b)   Reduction in operation and maintenance cost of substations (quantified);&#13;
(c)   Improved  information  for  planning   which  would  result  in&#13;
deferral/optimization of capital expenditure (not quantified);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
(d)   Reduced system losses by optimizing network operating configuration&#13;
(not quantified);&#13;
(e)   Improved customer relations due to utility's ability to keep customers&#13;
informed about system conditions (not quantified);&#13;
(f)    More efficient management of energy during supply shortages and&#13;
emergencies (not quantified);&#13;
(g)   Improved voltage regulation (not quantified); and&#13;
(h)   Upgrading of staff skills (not quantified).&#13;
5.4   PEA has made a detailed evaluation of unsupplied energy that would be&#13;
recovered, based on statistics of faults and outage times on each of the feeders in the five&#13;
regions in which distribution automation would be introduced (Annex 20). The value of&#13;
unsupplied energy is based on a study entitled "The Cost of an Outage" done by&#13;
consultants for the Thai power system in 1986. The results of this study were updated&#13;
and adjusted specifically for the PEA system by EGAT, yielding a value of Baht&#13;
45.7/kWh in 1995 prices. The saving in operation and maintenance costs is based on a&#13;
reduction of 4 staff for each substation in the area and an increase of 10 staff for each of&#13;
the five control centers, with an average annual salary level of Baht 120,000 per staff.&#13;
5.5   Costs and benefits are evaluated in 1995 price levels over a project economic life&#13;
of 25 years. The costs comprise: (a) capital investments, net of duties and taxes, in the&#13;
distribution automation system under the project; (b) the annual capital costs of&#13;
investments in automation facilities on additional feeders that would be installed in the&#13;
future to meet the demand growth; and (c) the annual operation and maintenance costs&#13;
evaluated at 1.5% of the capital costs. The benefits comprise: (a) the value of unsupplied&#13;
energy (para. 5.4); and (b) the savings in annual operation and maintenance costs of the&#13;
substations (para. 5.4). Details of the analysis are at Annex 21. The economic internal&#13;
rate of return (EIRR) is computed at 12.7%. As many of the intangible benefits of the&#13;
project have not been quantified, the figure of 12.7% represents the lower bound of the&#13;
EIRR. The risk of cost overruns beyond 10% is marginal, in view of very detailed cost&#13;
estimates prepared by the consultants. The risks of: (a) demands not materializing&#13;
significantly as forecast in these high potential growth areas; and (b) delay in project&#13;
implementation beyond one year, both of which would affect project benefits are also&#13;
minimal. Sensitivities are, therefore, undertaken only to get a feel of the robustness of the&#13;
project's economic viability. The EIRR stays above 10% (the opportunity cost of capital&#13;
in Thailand) for an increase in capital costs of about 30% or a reduction in the valuation&#13;
of benefits by about 25%.&#13;
Upgrading Distribution in South Thailand&#13;
5.6   A detailed least-cost analysis of this project component was undertaken by&#13;
consultants (Annex 22, Ref. 3). For the forecast demand growth in the area, the analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
considered two alternative scenarios (with the HV transmission voltage standardized at&#13;
115kV and the MV distribution voltage at 22/33kV, these are the only plausible supply&#13;
options): (a) With Project - this assumed construction of about 680 km of new 115kV&#13;
transmission lines and 20, 115/22/33kV step-down substations; and (b) Without Projict&#13;
(second best scenario): - this assumed that the demand could be met by expansion of&#13;
existing EGAT substations and adding 22/33kV feeders. Cost streams for the two&#13;
scenarios, over a project life of 30 years, considered: (a) capital investments excluding&#13;
duties and taxes; (b) the operation and maintenance costs at 1.5% of the capital costs; and&#13;
(c) the cost of losses evaluated at long run marginal cost of supply. With benefits (the&#13;
incremental energy sales) being the same for both scenarios, the benefit of the With&#13;
Projec scenario was considered to be the avoided cost of the Without Projec scenario.&#13;
The equalizing discount rates for the 20 sub-components of the project are tabulated in&#13;
Annex 9; all of these are above 13%. The equalizing discount rate for the project as a&#13;
whole is about 87%.&#13;
5.7    The EIRR for this project component is computed in 1995 prices for a project&#13;
economic life of 25 years, based on the following assumptions: (a) C=  include: (i)&#13;
capital investments in the 115kV lines and 115/22/33kV substations under the project&#13;
(excluding duties, taxes and IDC); (ii) investments in the downstream distribution&#13;
network to support the demand growth; (iii) the incremental operation and maintenance&#13;
cost of running the system expansion calculated at 1.5% of the incremental capital cost;&#13;
and (iv) the cost of energy evaluated at the Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of Baht&#13;
1.45/kWh; and (b) Benefits are evaluated in terms of average revenue from incremental&#13;
electricity sales (after allowing for a system loss of 5.5%) at Baht 1.83/kWh, which is the&#13;
average revenue realized by PEA from electricity sales in 1995. The EIRR is computed&#13;
at 11.7%. This represents the lower bound of the EIRR, as the willingness to pay (WTP)&#13;
for electricity is much higher than the average tariff. Sensitivities for higher values of&#13;
WTP are indicated below. The risk of cost overruns beyond 10% is minimal in view of&#13;
very detailed cost estimates prepared by the consultants and experience on similar&#13;
projects in the past. Likewise, the risk of demand falling below 10% of the estimated&#13;
figure is low. The EIRR stays above 10% for a 10% increase in capital costs or a 10%&#13;
reduction in demand.&#13;
Case                                        EIRR%&#13;
Case I - WTP = 1.05xAverage Tariff                  16.0&#13;
Case 2 - WTP = I.lOxAverage Tariff                  20.0&#13;
C. RISKS&#13;
5.8   The project as a whole does not face any significant risks. The basic planning of&#13;
the Distribution Automation System has been comprehensively carried out during the&#13;
feasibility study stage. Detailed project design and development of bid documents, for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
which consultants have already been appointed, should, therefore, proceed fairly&#13;
smoothly. The risk of delay in timely execution of the project, which could hamper&#13;
progress of industrial and commercial development in the area, could arise due to delays&#13;
in taking decisions on procurement.  In this regard, specific milestone dates for&#13;
procurement have been set and will be closely monitored by the Bank. Implementation of&#13;
the SCADA facilities is being planned through single responsibility contracting which&#13;
should result in speedy execution of the project. The risk of cost overruns is small; in any&#13;
case the project benefits are large enough to maintain project viability.&#13;
5.9   The basic planning for Upgrading Distribution in South Thailand has also been&#13;
comprehensively carried out during the feasibility study stage. Detailed project design,&#13;
for which consultants are expected to be appointed shortly, should, therefore, proceed&#13;
fairly smoothly. Implementation of the transmission lines and substations is being&#13;
planned on a single responsibility basis which should result in speedy execution of the&#13;
project. In view of advanced action taken by PEA in acquiring land for substations, this&#13;
activity is not expected to pose problems in project execution. PEA has already acquired&#13;
experience in the implementation of similar projects under the Bank's two current loans&#13;
(3404 -TH and 3798 - TH) and hence delays in procurement decisions are unlikely; in&#13;
any case this activity would be closely monitored by the Bank. The risk of load growth&#13;
not materializing as forecast is minimal, given the development potential of the area and&#13;
the very detailed estimates prepared for the demand forecasts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

THAILAND&#13;
Distribution Automation and Reliability Improvement Project&#13;
Regulatory Framework for the Energy Sector&#13;
(With Emphasis on the Power Sector)&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
The key governmental organization responsible for energy affairs in Thailand is the National Energy Policy&#13;
Council (NEPC). The NEPC is chaired by the Prime Minister, and its members include the National Economic&#13;
and Social Development Board (NESDB) and the Secretary General of the National Energy Policy Office&#13;
(NEPO). On behalf of the Cabinet, the NEPC approves policies, plans, and projects in the energy sector. The&#13;
NEPO, as the secretariat of NEPC, is the effective link between the NEPC and Thailand's state-owned energy&#13;
enterprises.  The functions and responsibilities of the NEPO are, among others, to:  (a) formulate and&#13;
disseminate NEPC directives; (b) formulate the broad commercial and operational responsibilities of the state-&#13;
owned energy enterprises; and (c) establish policy for the energy sector.  The NEPO therefore functions in&#13;
many ways as a "regulator" for the state-owned energy sector.&#13;
Currently, Thailand does not have an independent regulatory body for the energy sector. The regulatory role is,&#13;
as described above, performed by NEPO. These arrangements have thus far been satisfactory for the electric&#13;
sector because it is state-owned. There is no compelling reason to change these arrangements so long as the&#13;
electric sector, and particularly the transmission and distribution functions, remain state-owned. However, with&#13;
(a) the strong emphasis placed by the Government on mobilizing private capital to finance the massive&#13;
investments in the electric sector, and (b) the Government's plans to restructure the electric sector and its&#13;
functional units, and then move the units toward corporatization and eventual privatization, the time is opportune&#13;
to investigate the need for change and to review options for a regulatory system capable of managing the&#13;
requirements for transparent electric sector regulation in the future.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The technical assistance study will assist the Thai Government in developing a legal and regulatory framework&#13;
for the energy sector. The key objectives of the regulatory system wpuld be the introduction of market based&#13;
mechanisms, fair competition and economic efficiency. The existence of a suitable legal and regulatory system,&#13;
including creation of appropriate institutions, is seen as a prerequisite for a commercially-oriented electric&#13;
system, especially when private enterprises begin to play significant roles. The most important of these roles&#13;
are the functions that require the greatest measure of transparency and predictability, namely, the granting of&#13;
licenses and the setting of tariffs. There are a number of different legal and regulatory frameworks in existence&#13;
in the world today; no one model or system is appropriate for every country or system, but whatever system is&#13;
adopted must reflect the cultural, historical, and political realities of Thailand. It is therefore critical that all the&#13;
work undertaken be consistent with the current situation, and with the Government's proposals to restructure the&#13;
energy sector. The main elements of this work, to be undertaken by the Government with the assistance of the&#13;
Consultant, are to:&#13;
1.     define the appropriate regulatory functions to be undertaken by the independent regulatory agency;&#13;
2.     delineate and separate the oversight responsibilities of the independent regulatory agency from that of&#13;
government agencies and ministries;&#13;
3.     devise suitable institutional forms for the conduct of these functions, as well as establish regulatory&#13;
procedures and mechanisms; and&#13;
4.     develop a suitable time frame and sequence of steps through which the current regulatory system could&#13;
evolve into the desired model of regulation.&#13;
&#13;

Scope and Organization of Work&#13;
Given the complexity of regulatory reform and the need for a process that is open to review and inputs by all&#13;
stakeholders, the technical assistance activity is proposed to be divided into five phases.&#13;
Phase 1: Counterpart Arrangements and Background Report&#13;
The Privatization Sub-Committee chaired by NEPO will oversee and direct the entire project. The Privatization&#13;
Sub-Committee includes members from the: Fiscal Policy Office; Comptroller General's Office; NESDB; Prime&#13;
Minister's Office; and, the three power utilities (i.e. EGAT, PEA and MEA). Other relevant agencies such as&#13;
PTT, Ministry of Interior and the Public Works Department will be invited to participate in the project. This&#13;
committee that comprised of the Privatization Sub-Committee and other relevant agencies (referred henceforth&#13;
to as the "Steering Committee") will be responsible for directing the work and implementing its&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
The Steering Committee will be responsible for: (a) setting up a working group to interact on a day-to-day basis&#13;
with the Consultant; and (b) carrying out the required analytic and conceptual work. It is envisaged that the&#13;
working group (the "Working Group") will include representatives from the principal government agencies, and&#13;
other state-owned entities involved in energy sector decisions and operations.&#13;
During Phase 1, the Working Group and the Consultant will: (a) complete reviews of the implementation of&#13;
electric, gas and other sector reforms to date, and of the prevailing institutional arrangements; and (b) prepare a&#13;
report describing their findings (the "Background Report"). It is anticipated that Phase 1 will be completed by&#13;
March 1997. The Background Report will form the basis of the discussions of issues and regulatory objectives&#13;
within Thailand in Phase 2.&#13;
Phase 2: Definition of Fundamental Principles and Scope of Energy Sector Regulation&#13;
Phase 2 will be completed during an approximately two week period of intensive discussions between the&#13;
Steering Committee and the Consultant following the Steering Committee's review of the Background Report&#13;
distributed by the Working Group and the Consultant. The main elements of Phase 2 are the following:&#13;
(a)    Presentation by the Consultant and discussion with the Steering Committee of international&#13;
experiences in, and theories of, energy sector regulation. The focus will be on clarifying the&#13;
concepts of legal and economic regulation and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of&#13;
different regulatory techniques;&#13;
(b)    Definition by the Steering Committee of guiding principles and objectives of energy sector&#13;
regulation in Thailand;&#13;
(c)    Preparation by Consultant of a report (the "Scope of Regulation Report") of the required or&#13;
desired scope of energy sector regulation in Thailand, with the inputs and approval of the&#13;
Steering Committee; and&#13;
(d)    Determination of the appropriate number of task forces that should be formed from the Working&#13;
Group to complete Phase 3.&#13;
It will be extremely important that appropriate coordination with all other on-going preparatory work related to&#13;
power sector and energy sector regulation be developed during this phase of work. These linkages should be&#13;
clearly defined and the other Consultants and working groups be invited to the discussions. The most important&#13;
of the on-going tasks that will have to be closely coordinated are:&#13;
-      Rationalization of Bulk Supply Tariff to MEA and PEA: The inception report was completed in December&#13;
1995. This activity includes work on the approach to tariff setting and regulation of tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 4&#13;
-      PEA's Interfacing Arrangements with EGAT: This task has been initiated and work done will relate&#13;
closely to the appropriate delineation of the transmission and distribution system.&#13;
It is anticipated that Phase 2 will be completed in June 1997. The Scope of Regulation Report will lay the&#13;
foundations for discussions on the details and structure of energy sector regulation with the Working Group in&#13;
Phase 3, and will also be used in the workshop in Phase 4 as a starting point for discussions.&#13;
Phase 3: Preliminary Design of the Regulatory Framework&#13;
These Terms of Reference anticipate that pricing and licensing issues will be the two areas that will require the&#13;
most detailed review and input by the Government in order to provide guidance to the Consultant for the drafting&#13;
of laws and regulations in Phase 5. Therefore, these Terms of Reference describe the creation of two task&#13;
forces from the members of the Working Group and the Consultant ("Task Forces") to consider these issues. If&#13;
the Steering CommiKtee determines in Phase 2 that a different number of Task Forces should be created, then&#13;
the appropriate number of Task Forces shall be formed and the corresponding number of reports produced by&#13;
the Task Forces. Additional topics that could be appropriate for the formation of a Task Force include, among&#13;
others, the staffing, funding, and procedures of the regulatory authority, or the development of minimum service&#13;
standards for generators, the transmission entity, and distribution licensees.  The appropriate topics for&#13;
consideration by the Task Forces should become apparent as the Steering Committee reviews the Background&#13;
Report in Phase 2.&#13;
During Phase 3 the Working Group and the Consultant will focus on the topics as directed by the Steering&#13;
Committee. The Working Group and Consultant will divide into the appropriate number of Task Forces to&#13;
complete Phase 3 on a parallel-track basis. Three aspects of regulatory framework design that are likely to be&#13;
Task Force topics are:&#13;
1.     Price and Service Regulation&#13;
2.     Geographic and/or Scope of Service Licensing Regulation&#13;
3.     Gas Sector Regulation&#13;
The topics, which are outlined in greater detail below, are inter-related, and all conclusions of the Task Forces&#13;
must be consistent with the Scope of Regulation Report. The issues that are common to both topics relate to:&#13;
(a) the allocation of regulatory roles and responsibilities; and (b) the regulatory mechanisms and organizational&#13;
structure to perform these regulatory functions. These issues will be discussed by the Task Forces, as well as&#13;
in plenary sessions of the Working Group with the Consultant as and when required. It is anticipated that Phase&#13;
3 will be undertaken in September and October 1997.&#13;
For the purposes of example only, a non-comprehensive scope of issues that could be addressed by the task&#13;
Forces described above is as follows:&#13;
Task Force 1: Price and Service Regulation&#13;
(a)    Retail and bulk prices that may need to be regulated, including:&#13;
-      Retail consumer prices&#13;
-      Bulk transfer prices&#13;
(b)    Evaluation of mechanisms to regulate prices;&#13;
(c)    Principles to establish pricing policies, information needs for price setting/review; and&#13;
(d)    Administrative processes for price revisions.&#13;
Task Force 2: Geographic and/or Scope of Service Licensing Regulation&#13;
(a)    Evaluation of procedures and institutional responsibility for system planning, and the obligation&#13;
to serve;&#13;
(b)    Identification and evaluation of options to draw a balance between the need for appropriate&#13;
oversight of planning and investment decisions and the obligation to serve by a distribution&#13;
entity;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5 2-                                       Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
(c)    Reconciliation of the obligation to serve under a workable licensing and franchising framework;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)    Identification of methods and mechanisms to separate central and local responsibilities.&#13;
Task Force 3: Gas Sector Regulation in Thailand&#13;
(a)    Evaluation of structural options for the gas sector and market;&#13;
(b)    Introduction of competition in the gas sector; and&#13;
(c)    Price regulation of gas in a monopolistic market&#13;
Reports (the "Phase 3 Reports") as required to address the conclusions of the Task Forces, will be produced by&#13;
the Task Forces at the conclusion of Phase 3 and submitted to the Steering Committee.&#13;
Phase 4: Workshop - Energy Sector Regulation In Thailand&#13;
Phase 4 will be a workshop in December 1997 (the 'Workshop") to discuss the reports produced in Phases 1-3.&#13;
The Workshop will include the Steering Committee and additional senior policy makers, the Consultant,&#13;
representatives from the Working Group, the World Bank, energy enterprise officials, and energy sector experts&#13;
as appropriate to achieve a broad spectrum of points of view. At the Workshop the Consultant will present an&#13;
overview of the Scope of Regulation Report and the Phase 3 Reports. The Consultant will then lead discussions&#13;
of how the Phase 3 Reports are consistent with the Scope of Regulation Report, and answer any questions of&#13;
the Workshop participants regarding the consistency of these Reports with international practices.  The&#13;
Workshop participants will then discuss the implications of the Reports for Thailand, and attempt to achieve a&#13;
consensus as to appropriate legal and regulatory goals for a commercialized, and ultimately privatized, energy&#13;
sector in Thailand. The Consultant will produce minutes from the Workshop to record the consensus views, and&#13;
dissenting views (if any), of the Workshop participants. The Workshop will be important in developing a broad&#13;
consensus amongst policy makers in Thailand on the pace and scope of regulatory reform in the energy sector.&#13;
At present a three-day event is envisaged; one day for an opening session including an overview of the&#13;
Reports and a presentation of international experience in energy sector regulation, and two days for structured&#13;
discussions on the Reports to attempt to achieve consensus on the legal and regulatory goals for the Thai&#13;
electric sector. If necessary, the Workshop may be extended, or a second session called, so that by the time&#13;
the Workshop is adjourned a broad consensus on the Scope of Regulation Report and the Phase 3 Reports is&#13;
achieved. The Consultant shall modify the final versions of the Scope of Regulation Report and the Phase 3&#13;
Reports as necessary to reflect the Consensus of the Workshop. When the Workshop is adjourned, the Scope&#13;
of Regulation Report and the Phase 3 Reports (as finalized during the Workshop), together with the minutes of&#13;
the Workshop, shall be submitted to the Steering Committee for its official approval.&#13;
Phase 5: Drafting of Legal and Regulatory Framework&#13;
Based on the Scope of Regulation Report and the Phase 3 Reports as approved by the Steering Committee&#13;
following the Workshop (the "Final Reports"), the Consultant (with additional assistance from the Working Group,&#13;
if required) will begin to develop the elements of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework. Phase 5&#13;
outputs will include draft energy sector laws and regulations that incorporate the conclusions of the Final&#13;
Reports. The draft laws and regulations must clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of the different&#13;
government agencies, and must clearly identify new and/or revised roles of existing institutions. The draft&#13;
framework should propose organizational structures and staffing for all institutions.&#13;
The Consultant should complete Phase 5 within 4 months of the issuance of the Final Reports.&#13;

Distribution Automation and Rellability Improvement Project&#13;
PEA's Reform Implementation Plan&#13;
A. Reform Background&#13;
The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) is a wholly state-owned enterprise&#13;
responsible for distribution in all of Thailand, except for the greater metropolitan Bangkok area&#13;
which is serviced by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA). PEA, has over the last two&#13;
years, initiated a comprehensive effort to commercialize and corporatize its operations, with the&#13;
ultimate goal of privatization. This move is in-line with the Cabinet-level resolution for power&#13;
sector reform issued in September 1994.&#13;
To advance the reform effort within PEA a high-level privatization sub-committee&#13;
was established to oversee and manage the task. Preliminary studies were undertaken in 1994,&#13;
with the feasibility study submitted in February 1995. The feasibility study articulated a phased&#13;
restructuring strategy for PEA and recommended a priority focus on operational and functional&#13;
streamlining. This restructuring strategy was reviewed and approved by the Board of Governors of&#13;
PEA, who requested additional details on implementation. The phased approach to the&#13;
restructuring of PEA is seen as a three-step process spread over a 4-5 year timeframe.&#13;
Phase I       Operational Decentralization&#13;
PEA will decentralize the day-to-day management of operations to its four regional&#13;
distribution areas (i.e. regions). This phased progression will begin with the creation of&#13;
business units with greater operational autonomy with fully allocated costs (i.e. cost-&#13;
centers). This transition is expected to take around 2-years. Action plans for this phase&#13;
have been prepared and have been submitted for approval by PEA's Board of Governors.&#13;
Organizational restructuring and human resource and skills upgrading are seen as the&#13;
most crucial implementation challenges in Phase 1. Stress will be laid on the important&#13;
up-front change management process in order to decentralize headquarter functions to&#13;
the regions.&#13;
PEA is expected to be classified as an "Excellent State Enterprise" by mid-1996.&#13;
Achievement of the excellent state enterprise status provides management with the&#13;
authority to devise and implement a suitable staffing and compensation system. This step&#13;
will have a major impact in improving management incentives and is critical to many of the&#13;
changes planned in Phase 1. The excellent state enterprise status requires: (a) return on&#13;
revalued assets greater than 6%; (b) labor cost below 10% of total costs; and (c) annual&#13;
productivity increases equal or greater than 2%.&#13;
Figure 1 represents the existing PEA organizational structure. Figure 3 represents the&#13;
fully allocated regional cost center structure with greater autonomy accorded to regions&#13;
headed by Deputy Govemors rather than Assistant Governor's under the existing&#13;
structure.&#13;
Phase 2       Regional Profit Center Structure&#13;
From a fully allocated regional cost structure with wider central service support, PEA will&#13;
transition to fully independent utility profit centers. This transition is expected to take an&#13;
additional year after the implementation of regional cost center structure. Separation of&#13;
non-core functions as separate units will begin to be undertaken in this phase with&#13;
transactions with the regions based on transparent transfer prices. (See figure 4.)&#13;
&#13;

Phase 3        PEA Holding Company and Regional Subsidiaries&#13;
From regional utility profit center operation PEA will transition to a PEA Holding Company&#13;
structure with the regional utility subsidiaries. The Holding Company would provide&#13;
limited central services and policy guidance.   These central services could include:&#13;
coordination in tariff setting and power system  management;  certain specialized&#13;
engineering services; and assistance in financing of major projects and overall debt&#13;
management. Non-core profits centers created in Phase 2, will be spun-off in this phase.&#13;
These subsidiaries will ultimately compete for PEA business with a transitional&#13;
arrangement of continued PEA service contracts before embarking on purely market&#13;
operation (See figure 5).&#13;
B. Reform and Restructuring Implementation Actions&#13;
(Phase I - FY 1996-97)&#13;
The reform implementation actions for Phase 1 were developed by eight PEA&#13;
working groups defined along functional lines.   The working groups are: finance, human&#13;
resources, planning, management, regional restructuring, technique, corporate services and&#13;
construction and maintenance.   These groups were assisted by a General Consultant and&#13;
supervised by the privatization sub-committee. Owing to the functional overlap of the working&#13;
groups and the broad organizational restructuring planned, coordination in the development of the&#13;
implementation plans as well as in actual implementation is very crucial. Care has been taken to&#13;
ensure effective coordination between the working groups during all stages of restructuring. The&#13;
implementation plans developed by each working group are all part of the broader strategic&#13;
objective of creating an effective and efficient organization that would operate on commercial lines&#13;
and make the transition to private ownership possible. The key implementation actions in these&#13;
areas is summarized below:&#13;
Finance&#13;
The focus of the finance implementation actions are to: (a) develop a core of&#13;
expertise in private sector accounting standards and principles; (b) establish a system to identify&#13;
and allocate costs and profits associated with providing electric service; and (c) implement an&#13;
integrated computerized accounting system. The implementation elements are:&#13;
Activity                      Implementation Strategy                Schedule&#13;
Introduce private sector accounting  -  Define method to track costs and profits of&#13;
standards and practices            business units&#13;
-  Define basis of cost allocation for each function&#13;

Human Resources&#13;
The objectives of the plan are to: (a) revise and enhance PEA personnel systems&#13;
for more effective human resource management and utilization; (b) develop better training and&#13;
career development practices; and (c) create a system for continuous manpower analysis to&#13;
meet demands and rectify shortcomings. To link into the broader organizational restructuring,&#13;
specifically the decentralization of regional operations, the intention is to create human resource&#13;
management capabilities in the proposed regional profit centers which operate under the policy&#13;
guidance of the PEA Holding Company human resource office. This decentralization will proceed&#13;
in  conjunction  with  the  introduction  of the  improved  human  resource  practices.   The&#13;
implementation elements are:&#13;

Regional Restructuring&#13;
The objective of regional restructuring is to successively transform the Regions to&#13;
business units (i.e. fully allocated cost centers), profits centers and subsidiary Regional&#13;
Distribution Companies. They must become autonomous entities with the capabilities to manage&#13;
their businesses like private companies. They will do so under the management, standards, rules&#13;
and guidelines established by the PEA Holding Company.   As much of the restructuring work is&#13;
directed at achieving successful regionalization of PEA, implementation will be a comprehensive&#13;
effort by all working groups.   The following are the key implementation responsibilities of the&#13;
regional working group:&#13;

Technique&#13;
Technique is the department within PEA that provides engineering design and&#13;
services to other units of PEA.   The restructuring of Technique is driven by the objectives of&#13;
regional decentralization and streamlining.   The ultimate goal is to create Technique as a&#13;
subsidiary engineering company within the PEA Holding Company structure, selling engineering&#13;
services to the parent and other subsidiary companies. The implementation elements are:&#13;

Terms of Reference&#13;
PEA's Interfacing Arrangements with EGAT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    Demand for electricity in Thailand is forecast to grow at a rate of almost 10% p.a.&#13;
over 1995 - 2000. The largest and fastest growing share of retail sales (accounting for&#13;
55% of EGAT's generation, up from 24% five years ago) is occurring in PEA's&#13;
distribution franchise areas. In these areas retail sales grew at an average of over 15% per&#13;
year over the last 10 years. Over the next decade, PEA will have to mature from a utility,&#13;
largely preoccupied with the Government's Rural Electrification (RE) program, to&#13;
become a more commercial organization faced with improving the quality of service to&#13;
its major industrial and commercial customers. PEA's distribution system in Thailand is&#13;
extensive. It includes 194,375 ckm of medium voltage and 769 ckm of high voltage&#13;
distribution lines and 28,126 MVA of transformer capacity. The bulk of PEA medium&#13;
voltage (MV) distribution is carried out at 22kV and 33kV, with 22kV constituting&#13;
almost 83% and 33kV almost 17% of the total network.&#13;
2.    Faced with the challenge, PEA is investing about US$2 billion for the 1993-1997&#13;
period in extending the provincial 115kV subtransmission, and reinforcing the MV&#13;
distribution systems to improve overall system efficiency, maintain MV system losses at&#13;
optimum levels, and importantly enhance the quality of supply. The investment program&#13;
will also substantially complete the rural electrification in the country, so that by the end&#13;
of the century, virtually all villages in Thailand will have access to electricity. A notable&#13;
feature of PEA's plan is that in building 65 new 115 kV substations (in comparison to 16&#13;
being build by EGAT in the same period), there will be a shift in responsibility from&#13;
EGAT to PEA for the future development of the 115 kV sub-transmission system.&#13;
3.    Continuing 115kV expansion will be needed to reinforce, at least cost, the&#13;
capacity of PEA's MV networks to reduce losses, and improve the quality and reliability&#13;
of power supplies to its consumers. Likewise EGAT's transmission system will also be&#13;
expanding, necessitating the construction of new high capacity EHV (220/5OOkV)&#13;
transmission circuits to provide the transmission infrastructure for stability and reliability&#13;
of its bulk supplies to PEA. Many of EGAT's new EHV lines interconnect main power&#13;
stations, and bulk supply substations, will be adjacent to the older 115kV circuits. These&#13;
will become increasingly redundant to EGAT's needs, and will increasingly be turned&#13;
over to radial operation more suited to PEA's needs. While some of these 115 kV lines&#13;
may be retained by EGAT, where they are critical to its operations, or where they can be&#13;
uprated in future, most other lines should be transferred to PEA in the interest of overall&#13;
efficiency in transmission and subtransmission operations.&#13;
&#13;

B. Description of Proposed Technical Assistance&#13;
4.    The TA would assist the Government to prepare the proposed project by financing&#13;
the investigation of the technical, economic and ownership aspects of transmission and&#13;
subtransmission development in Thailand, to assist in rationalizing interface&#13;
arrangements between EGAT and PEA and thereby determine the appropriate costs of&#13;
supply for charging purposes. The study should consider a number of technical issues in&#13;
arriving at its conclusions, which will be used as a basis for negotiations with regard the&#13;
transfer of existing 115kV transmission assets. The study will be done utilizing PEA's&#13;
GIS facilities to map the structure of the existing and planned 115kV subtransmission&#13;
systems, and hence determine costs of supply to PEA rural, urban and industrial service&#13;
areas. The approach to be followed, and incorporated in the consultants TOR, should be&#13;
generally as detailed below:&#13;
(a)   Digitize all of PEA's MV service areas based on the extent of supplies&#13;
from   115/22kV  substations.  Using existing and forecast demand&#13;
characteristics for each service area, estimate: (i) load densities&#13;
(kW/sqkm); (ii) service characteristics (MVA fault level/reliability index);&#13;
and (iii) costs of supply from the main EGAT 220/500kV supply point to&#13;
the respective load center in S/kW/km. Costs of supply will be assessed&#13;
using standard unit costs for different types (pole, single, double circuit,&#13;
etc.) of 115kV lines, substations (dependent on fault level, redundancy&#13;
capacity, outgoing feeders, etc.), and 22kV bulk feeders taken from the&#13;
115/22kV substations up to the demand center (from which the 22kV&#13;
distribution lines emanate); and including the EGAT capacity charges for&#13;
each of the existing bulk power substations;&#13;
(b)   Review the basis for establishing new 115kV supply points in terms of&#13;
EGAT technical requirements (fault levels, reliability, cost of land, ROW,&#13;
etc.) and determine how costs are allocated to PEA and EGAT&#13;
respectively in selecting locations for new substations;&#13;
(c)    Review the range of costs of supply computed, and group them according&#13;
to the characteristics of each service area (e.g. region, rural flat, rural&#13;
mountainous, urban low density, urban high density, industrial estate, etc.)&#13;
to identify anomalies in the cost of supplies and the reasons for any&#13;
significant differences;&#13;
(d)   Examine alternative methods for reducing per unit supply costs by&#13;
extending PEA subtransmission and/or reinforcing distribution lines,&#13;
assuming new points of supply can be made available from the nearest&#13;
EGAT transmission lines, and estimate the costs of doing so using&#13;
standard rates for the extensions involved;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
(e)   Review EGAT's concerns with regard to transmission system integrity and&#13;
transfer capacity taking into consideration ROW restrictions, future&#13;
expansion requirements and determine if transfer of existing lines to PEA&#13;
would be technically feasible;&#13;
(f)   Investigate condition of facilities that would be transferred to determine if&#13;
uprating is feasible and desirable and estimate the approximate value of&#13;
the assets involved, and the costs of operating the maintaining the lines;&#13;
(g)   Recommend  technical  and  pricing  policies  for  transmission/&#13;
subtransmission/distribution interface design and a basis for determining&#13;
the allocation of costs of installing a new points of supply; and&#13;
(h)   Perform specific studies of individual cases in more detail to verify the&#13;
broad findings of the study.&#13;
C. Technical Assistance Timetable&#13;
5.    The study should be completed over nine months requiring about 50 man-months&#13;
(local and foreign) of input with assistance from PEA counterpart staff responsible for&#13;
GIS mapping. It will require the services of specialists in GIS applications design, power&#13;
systems analysis, transmission planning, and equipment valuation. Outputs will include:&#13;
(a) the establishment of a comprehensive GIS subtransmission planning system&#13;
identifying PEA networks and their respective supply and cost characteristics; (b)&#13;
information that can be used by PEA for determining the true costs of supply to its&#13;
respective service areas; and (c) report and recommendations to be used as a basis for&#13;
discussions between PEA and EGAT. The following schedule is proposed for project&#13;
preparation.&#13;

PEA's Financial Projections&#13;
Revenues&#13;
1.        The average price of electricity is about/B 1.68 per kWh sold in 1995 and is expected&#13;
to remain at about that level throughout the projection period. This constant tariff assumes that the&#13;
EGAT tariff to PEA remains constant through the period. Further tariff increases by EGAT to PEA&#13;
would require commensurate increases in the PEA retail tariff. The EGAT price is, of course,&#13;
dependent on the cost of oil. Increases in the price of fuel (as well as increases in foreign exchange&#13;
costs, taxes, and demand side management costs) would be incorporated into an automatic fuel&#13;
adjustment clause and the tariffs would be raised (or lowered) accordingly.&#13;
2.         Energy sales are expected to grow on average 10% per year through 2003, based on&#13;
projections made by the Load Forecast Subcommittee. These projections include near-term&#13;
electricity sales increases which already have been contracted in industrial estates, and over the&#13;
longer term are basically extrapolations of recent trends checked against econometric models&#13;
involving assumptions on the growth of the gross domestic product.&#13;
3.        Other Operating Revenues include: (i) revenues from sales of electrical equipment,&#13;
(ii) rent from properties, (iii) revenues from installation, inspection and other fees. (iv) revenues&#13;
from  connection  fees. (v) revenues and  subsidy  from  construction  for cuLstomers. and&#13;
(vi) miscellaneous reveniues.&#13;
4.         Power purchased from EGAT is at/B  1.09/kWh in 1995 and is expected to remain at&#13;
that level throughout the projection period. Losses within the PEA system are currently about 5%&#13;
and are expected to remain at about that level.&#13;
5.        Distribution expenses are projected on the basis of unit costs and the additions in line&#13;
length and substation capacity in PEA's expansion program. Other operation and maintenance&#13;
expenses, including General and Administrative expenses, are based on current levels, inflated at&#13;
4% per annum.&#13;
6.        Depreciation is based on the straight-line method on revalued fixed assets using an&#13;
average rate of 4.5%.&#13;
7.        The rate of remittance to the Government of Thailand is assumed to be 30%&#13;
throughout the projected period. (The net income for tax calculation purposes is based on&#13;
unrevalued depreciation.) This rate of remittance is higher than the 21% which PEA paid during&#13;
&#13;

the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan period, but was increased in order for PEA to qualify for&#13;
efficient state enterprise status in 1995.&#13;
8.         Bonus to Employees are projected to be 9% of net income.&#13;
Equity&#13;
9.         Equity contributions represent the Government of Thailand's funding of rural&#13;
electrification projects.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Losses&#13;
10.       Deferred foreign exchange losses represent the profits and losses from exchange rate&#13;
variations on long-term debt. The projected figures are the amount on PEA's accounts at the end of&#13;
FY 1995 less than the incremental amounts which are scheduled to be written off over the&#13;
remaining period of PEA's existing loans. The amounts shown in the income statement and&#13;
balance sheet reflect currency movements against the Baht through December 31, 1995.&#13;
Borrowings&#13;
11.       Future foreign loans have been assumed at annual interest rates varying from 3% to&#13;
10.75% and for terms of up to 18 vears including from 5 to 10 years of grace. Local borrowings&#13;
have been assumed at annual interest rates of 6% to 10.75% and for terms of 5 to 10 years.&#13;
12.       Accounts receivable are projected to be 36 days of revenues.&#13;
13.       Accounts payable are estimated to be 35 days of expenses.&#13;

Benefits of Automation&#13;
Benefit                                     Description&#13;
Reduction in Customer                 A faster response to faults will lead to a reduction in the&#13;
Hours Lost                            number of customer hours lost. There are a number of&#13;
elements which will make up this reduction, as follows:&#13;
(a) swift notification of the occurrence of a fault;&#13;
(b) rapid identification of the approximate location of the&#13;
fault;&#13;
(c) immediate switching to restore supply to customers fed&#13;
from healthy sections of network; and&#13;
(d) dispatch of crews directly to the fault area.&#13;
Other benefits include improved service to customers,&#13;
improved cash flows, societal economic benefits, higher&#13;
customer confidence in PEA, etc.&#13;
Improved Information for Planning     The proposed system will provide much-improved&#13;
information for planning purposes. The historical archive&#13;
feature will allow feeder and substation load profiles to be&#13;
examined in detail and will eliminate the need to make&#13;
assumptions about daily load profiles, the variation of load&#13;
throughout the year, load factors, etc.&#13;
Deferral/Optimization of Capital      Better information for planning will lead to more efficient use&#13;
Expenditure                           of capital: it will be possible to defer some projects based on&#13;
improved information regarding actual loads, load profile and&#13;
likelihood of coincident occurrence of relevant factors.&#13;
Reduced System Losses                 The proposed systems can be used to reduce distribution&#13;
system losses in several ways by allowing:&#13;
(a) the optimum choice of Normally Open position;&#13;
(b) the operation of certain plant in parallel (i.e. where a fast&#13;
response may be required to decouple the paralleled plant&#13;
in the event of a fault, etc.) This might include&#13;
paralleling two transformers which have different&#13;
characteristics, or closing a N.O. point on the network&#13;
between two separate distribution substations;&#13;
(c) the switching out of lightly loaded transformers in bulk&#13;
supply substations during periods of low load; and&#13;
(d) voltage control improvements, i.e. losses can be reduced&#13;
if the distribution voltage is kept as close to is upper limit&#13;
as possible.&#13;
Reduced Manning of Substations        The implementation of a SCADA system would allow&#13;
demanning of substations.&#13;
Supports Future Development of Full-  The existence of a SCADA system will be a pre-requisite for&#13;
Scale DMS                             the development of a full DMS system, which would be&#13;
linked to the customer billing and facilities information&#13;
systems.&#13;

Benefit                                       Description&#13;
Efficient Operation of the Power Network   Having centralized monitoring of the complete distribution&#13;
system will allow the efficient operation of the networks.&#13;
Efficiency improvements will consist of optimum network&#13;
sectionalizing (to minimize losses or to reduce the risk of&#13;
faults for important customers), anticipation of overloads&#13;
allowing switching to alleviate any problems, fast response to&#13;
fault trippings, etc.&#13;
Reduced Manpower Required to Operate   With all information being reported automatically to a central&#13;
the System                              monitoring system which has remote control facilities, the&#13;
utility will be able to carry out switching and fault finding&#13;
using far less resources.&#13;
Improved Customer Service               In addition to the tangible improvement in the continuity of&#13;
supply, there will be an intangible improvement in the level of&#13;
customer service arising from the faster restoration of supply&#13;
and from the utility's ability to inform customers of the likely&#13;
delay in restoring supply.&#13;
Management of Energy during Supply      During power system emergencies (i.e. major storms,&#13;
Shortages and Emergencies               insufficient generation to meet demand, etc.) a SCADA/DMS&#13;
system will allow the equitable sharing of available resources.&#13;
Remote control facilities will allow load shedding to be&#13;
carried out from a single location.&#13;
The accurate balancing of load will allow a minimum safety&#13;
margin to be used during rota load shedding/restoration by&#13;
preventing large swings in demand while circuits are being&#13;
switched in and out.&#13;
During such periods, it would be possible to reduce system&#13;
demand by reducing the distribution voltages by say 5%.&#13;
System security will be improved by the ability to carry out&#13;
rapid load shedding in the event of a major system&#13;
disturbance, possibly preventing a complete collapse of the&#13;
system.&#13;
Improved Voltage Regulation             Real-time information about the voltage in feeding substations&#13;
(via the SCADA system) and out on the networks (via the DA&#13;
system), together with (future) calculated information based&#13;
on the correlation of customers with the distribution network,&#13;
will allow accurate and optimum control of the distribution&#13;
system voltage.&#13;

            Thailand - Distribution Automation and
            Reliability Improvement Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Distribution
            Automation and Reliability Improvement Project for Thailand
            are to: (a) improve through automation the efficiency and
            reliability of Provincial Electricity Authority's (PEA)
            distribution network and strengthen its operational
            capabilities; (b) upgrade the distribution system in the
            south of Thailand to meet demand growth efficiently and at
            least cost; (c) strengthen PEA's engineering and
            management capabilities through the integration of its
            Geographical Information System with the proposed
            Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system; (d)
            help rationalize PEA system's interfacing arrangements
            with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
            (EGAT), an important step towards its regionalization and
            subsequent privatization; and (e) help investigate the
            issues and options for the regulatory framework of the
            energy sector. The components of the project are: (a)
            Distribution Automation System comprising: (1) six control
            centers with SCADA facilities, and consolidation reporting
            facilities in PEA's Head Office; (2) remote-controlled
            distribution line switching equipment; (3) fault indicators,
            remote terminal units and ultra high frequency
            communications links; and (4) construction of six control
            centers and modification of existing substations; (b)
            upgrading distribution in South Thailand comprising the
            construction of transmission lines and associated
            substations; (c) consulting services for the detailed design
            and project management of the Distribution Automation
            System, including training of PEA technical staff, and
            upgrading distribution in south Thailand; and (d) technical
            assistance for the rationalization of PEA's interfacing
            arrangements with EGAT and study of issues and options for
            the regulatory framework of the energy sector.
