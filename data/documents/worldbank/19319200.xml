                    THE CHAIRMAN :   Right.&#13;
                    I would like to welcome t oday Mr. Svendsen of Norway,&#13;
               who has been appointed Alternate Executive Director by Mr.&#13;
&#13;
               Beyen.   He came in after the meeting started so I didn't&#13;
               have a chance to introduce him before.      We are glad to have&#13;
&#13;
               you here.&#13;
                    I would like to just take a few minutes to tell you of&#13;
&#13;
               another matter -- some discussions which have been going&#13;
&#13;
               on in a tentative way and which Mr. Black expects to&#13;
               carry forward in Brussels regarding a possible prospective&#13;
&#13;
               loan to Belgium, the Bel gian Congo.      I will ask Mr. Iliff&#13;
               if he would be kind enough to outline to you what up to&#13;
&#13;
               n ow has been put forward as a line of approach.&#13;
                    MR. ILIFF:     Mr. Chairman, the Board will remember&#13;
               that in March of 1949 we entered into a loan contrac t with&#13;
               the Kingdom of Belgium for a 16 million dollar loan, of whic&#13;
               the proceeds were to be expended in financing the foreign&#13;
&#13;
               exchange costs of imports required to develop two Belgian&#13;
&#13;
               steel mills and a power project .&#13;
&#13;
                    Very soon after that loan was made, we were approached&#13;
&#13;
               by the Belgian    Gove~nment   with a proposal for another loan&#13;
&#13;
               to the Kingdom of Bel gium.      The justification advanced by&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   23&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          the Belgian Government for that operation in the view of&#13;
&#13;
          the President was not adequate to warrant him recommending&#13;
&#13;
          it to the Board.&#13;
&#13;
               Subsequently, we had a. further approach from the&#13;
&#13;
         Belgian Ministry of the Colonies, who raised with the&#13;
&#13;
         International Bank the possibility of a loan to assist in&#13;
&#13;
         financing a development program in the Belgian Congo.     That&#13;
&#13;
         is a ten-year program whose estimated cost amounts to a&#13;
&#13;
         very large sum of money.&#13;
&#13;
              The Bank in response to that approach indicated its&#13;
&#13;
         interest in principle in participating in financing such a&#13;
&#13;
         program.   Further discussions took place with the Belgian&#13;
&#13;
         authorities in the course of which it emerged that the&#13;
&#13;
         Belgian Government would find some difficulty in guarantee-&#13;
&#13;
         ing an International Bank loan to the Belgian Congo unless&#13;
&#13;
         the Bank operation made some recognition of the impact of&#13;
&#13;
         the Congo development program in terms of foreign exchange on&#13;
&#13;
         the economy of metropolitan Belgium itself.&#13;
&#13;
              Now, this impact arises from the fact that a very sub-&#13;
&#13;
         stantial part of the import requirements of the Congo&#13;
&#13;
         program will be procured in metropolitan Belgium.   This will&#13;
&#13;
         lead to a large expansion of Belgian incomes.   And if infla-&#13;
&#13;
         tion is to be avoided, this increase in Belgian incomes will&#13;
&#13;
         increase Belgium's need to use foreign exchange for imports&#13;
&#13;
         into Belgium itself partly in the form of raw materials,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    24&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          partly in the form of components and partly in the form of&#13;
&#13;
          consumer goods.&#13;
&#13;
               The management of the Bank feels, therefore, that&#13;
&#13;
          there are valid economic reasons for approaching the problem&#13;
&#13;
          of Bank participation in the Congo development program with&#13;
&#13;
          two principles in mind.    The first would be the possibility&#13;
&#13;
          of financing to the extent necessary the foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
          costs, direct and indirect, of imports into the Congo from&#13;
&#13;
          sources other than the Belgian franc area, and secondly&#13;
&#13;
          a recognition of the impact of the Congo development program&#13;
&#13;
          on the foreign exchange resources of metropolitan Belgium&#13;
&#13;
          herself.&#13;
&#13;
               Accordingly, the President, who as Mr. Garner says ex-&#13;
&#13;
          pects to be in Brussels early next week, proposes to under-&#13;
&#13;
          take discussions with the Belgian Government leading towards&#13;
&#13;
          a possible International Bank operation to assist in the&#13;
&#13;
          financing of the Congo development program based upon the&#13;
          two principles that I have just mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
               The Congo plan is a ten-year plan.    Up to now, only the&#13;
&#13;
          program for the first three-year phase has been worked out&#13;
&#13;
          with any degree of definitiveness.    At this stage, therefore,&#13;
&#13;
         any Bank financing would be related to the three-year&#13;
&#13;
          program.   And j f the Board 'vould care to have some general&#13;
&#13;
          jnformation as to what is involved in this three-year&#13;
&#13;
         program, I think Mr. Garner will ask Mr. Kamarck in a fewÂ·&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      25&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
          minutes to give some information on that point.&#13;
&#13;
               The total cost of the three-yearÂ· progre.m in dollar&#13;
&#13;
          equivalents will be about 240 millions.   Of this, local&#13;
&#13;
          savings can cover local expenditures -- and when I talk&#13;
&#13;
          of local savings I mean local savings in the Congo itself&#13;
&#13;
             can coverâ&#128;¢ local expenditures to the extent of the&#13;
&#13;
          equivalent of 68 million dollars, which leaves 172 million&#13;
&#13;
          dollars to be obtained from outside the Congo.&#13;
&#13;
               Now, of that 172 million it is calculated that the&#13;
          equivalent of 98 million dollars will be required for im-&#13;
&#13;
          ports from outside the Belgian franc area.   The Belgian&#13;
&#13;
          authorities already have foreign financing in sight to the&#13;
&#13;
          extent of approximately 55 to 60 million dollars.    So there&#13;
&#13;
          is a gap of approximately 40 million dollars to meet the&#13;
&#13;
          actual foreign exchange costs of the imports into the Congo&#13;
&#13;
          itself other than from the Belgian franc area.    And it&#13;
&#13;
          would be a figure of that order which might constitute the&#13;
&#13;
          amount of the Bank's contribution directly to the Congo.&#13;
&#13;
               I should say at this stage, sir, that that figure&#13;
&#13;
          that I mentioned is approximate, and ,.,e shall still have to&#13;
&#13;
          have rurther discussions with the Belgian authorities before&#13;
&#13;
          we can arrive at a definitive amount.&#13;
&#13;
               As regards metropolitan Belgium, we calculate from&#13;
&#13;
          the information that we have before us that the Congo will&#13;
&#13;
          import directly from Belgium a very substantial quantity of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          26&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
            Belgian production.     It will probably be equivalent to some-&#13;
&#13;
            thing of the order of 75 million dollars.&#13;
&#13;
                   Now, the addition to Belgian incomes   ~rhich ~rill   apise&#13;
&#13;
            from this impact on Belgian production will very much exceed&#13;
&#13;
            that amount of 75 mill:l.on dollars.   The actual impact on&#13;
       ;j&#13;
       If   the Belgian foreign exchange reserves has yet to be worked&#13;
       II&#13;
       d&#13;
       11   out.    It will require detailed study by the Bank staff in&#13;
       II&#13;
       I&#13;
       1l   consultation with Belgian economists.     So, at this stage&#13;
&#13;
            I am not able to indicate what the order of magnitude of&#13;
&#13;
            that impact might be.    I should say, however, that it would&#13;
&#13;
            be the management's proposal to finance only the foreign&#13;
&#13;
            exchange cost to metropolitan Belgium to the extent that&#13;
&#13;
            they may be involved in gold or dollars.&#13;
&#13;
                   The whole justification for this combined operation&#13;
&#13;
            l:tes in the desirability of furthering economic development&#13;
&#13;
            in the Belgian Congo, and the Bank would therefore look&#13;
&#13;
            for assurances from the Belgian Government that the goods&#13;
&#13;
            of Belgian origin actually needed for the Congo development&#13;
&#13;
            program will be made available from the production potential&#13;
&#13;
            of the metropole.&#13;
&#13;
                   I should add too that when I mention this three-year&#13;
&#13;
            program of investment in the Belgian Congo as costing some-&#13;
&#13;
            thing like 240 million dollars, or equivalent, that we are&#13;
&#13;
            taking into consideration only investment in the public&#13;
&#13;
            sector.   It is expected that there will be a very substantia&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          27&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
         additional amount of investment in the private         sector~   which&#13;
&#13;
         again will have its impact on metropolitan Belgium in the&#13;
&#13;
         same directions as I have indicated for the investment in&#13;
&#13;
         the public sector.      So that by taking into account only the&#13;
&#13;
         effects of investment in the public       sector~   we are being&#13;
&#13;
         conservative in our assessment of the impact on Belgium's&#13;
&#13;
         foreign exchange position.&#13;
&#13;
              The setup of this     operation~   if it comes to   fruition~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         is a matter for fUrther study.      The mechanics can be worked&#13;
&#13;
         out in a variety of    ways~   and we have not yet come to any&#13;
&#13;
         firm conclusion as to how the operation shall be set up.&#13;
&#13;
         At this   stage~   the management wish to inform the Board of&#13;
&#13;
         the principles of the approach which might be adopted by&#13;
&#13;
         the President in his forthcoming talks in Brussels.&#13;
&#13;
              I think I ought to add this, sir:       That from the point&#13;
&#13;
         of view of creditworthiness, the staff are satisfied that&#13;
&#13;
         whatever the amount that we are thinking of at the moment&#13;
&#13;
         may be, it will be well within Belgium's capacity to repay.&#13;
&#13;
              THE CHAIRMAN:     Are there any questions or connnents to be&#13;
&#13;
         made regarding this?&#13;
&#13;
              MR. BEYEN:     It sounds like a very intelligent     way~   Mr.&#13;
&#13;
         Chairman, of getting out of a very delicate problem.&#13;
&#13;
              THE CHAIRMAN:     All right.   Then we will advise the&#13;
&#13;
         President that in general the Board is satisfied for him to&#13;
&#13;
         carry forward these general discussions, and if they progress&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                 28&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
       :I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            favorably~     then the question of getting technical people to&#13;
&#13;
            work on the figures with the Belgians will then proceed.&#13;
&#13;
                  I would like to ask for a meeting of the Financial&#13;
&#13;
            Policy Committee either tomorrow or Friday for a preliminary&#13;
&#13;
            discussion of next year's          budget~   and I wonder whether&#13;
&#13;
            tomorrow afternoon will be convenient for the Committee?&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. BEYEN:     It would be convenient if it could be done&#13;
&#13;
            before four     o'clock~    Mr. Chairman.      I have a meeting at four&#13;
&#13;
            o'clock.&#13;
                  THE CHAIRMAN:        Well~   would two-thirty be all right to-&#13;
&#13;
            morrow afternoon?      Or would Friday be more convenient?&#13;
&#13;
                  SIR ERNEST ROWE-DUTTON:          Mr.   Chairman~   I have an un-&#13;
&#13;
            avoidable appointment with the dentist.&#13;
&#13;
                  THE CHAIRMAN:        Well~   tomorrow morning or Friday morning?&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. BEYEN:    Tomorrow morning or Friday morning.&#13;
&#13;
                  THE CHAIRMAN:        Tomorrow morning say at eleven o'clock?&#13;
&#13;
            Is that all right?&#13;
                  All right.     Then we will ask for that.          Tomorrow at&#13;
&#13;
            eleven in this room.         All right.&#13;
                  Then~   I would just like to reemphasize the understanding&#13;
&#13;
            that on the British bond issue that is confidential                action~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            and we will keep it within the Board until we know definite-&#13;
&#13;
            ly.&#13;
&#13;
                  And~    of course, the Belgian matter is confidential&#13;

&#13;
               The Board will recollect that, in b&gt;Brch of 1949, the Bank&#13;
      entered into a Loan Agreel'8ent vith the Kingdom of Belgiwa for a&#13;
      lOAn 1n tbe amount of $16 nd.llion, The proceeds or this loan vere&#13;
      to be applied to Dli!Hâ&#128;¢tbg the foreign exchange cost of equipment to&#13;
      be imported into Balgiutn for the expansion of wo Belgian steel mills&#13;
      a~ a power plant.&#13;
&#13;
               Not long afterwards, the Belgian Govel"Ul\19nt raised with the&#13;
      Bank the possibility of a f'urth~r Bank loan to the Kingdom of" Belgiwa.&#13;
      After discussion with the Belgian Govel'llll9nt 1 t wan agreed that th6&#13;
      justification tor the loan was not such as to warrant pr~sentatlon&#13;
      to the Board at that ti'f.lle.&#13;
                 Som.ewhe.t lcter a further approach was made t:.o the Bank by the&#13;
      Belgian Ministry of the Colonies with the object of discussing the&#13;
      posaibillty of a loan from the International Bank to assist in finan-&#13;
      cing the economic development prograiBme in the Belgian Congo. The&#13;
      Congo authorities h&amp;ve already embarked on the earliest atages or&#13;
      this programme, which is estw.ted to take about ten yeari! to im-&#13;
      plement... It vUl involve a yery large investment, not only in the&#13;
      public but also in the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
               In response to the approach of the Belgian Miniotr1 of the&#13;
      Colonies, the Bank indicated ita interest, in principle, in partici-&#13;
      pating in the financing of such a programrd9.&#13;
&#13;
                 J.l'Y..trther diiiOutasions took place with the Belgian authorities,&#13;
      in the cour.e ot which it emerged that the Belgian Gove:rnaent would&#13;
      f'ioo some dif"ficulty in guaranteeing any International B81lk loan to&#13;
      the Belgian Congo unless the operation to be undertaken by the Bank&#13;
      made some reeognltion of the impact of the Congo develop~nt pro-&#13;
      graD~~~$, in terme of foreign exchange, on the econom;r of metropolitan&#13;
      Belgium itself'.&#13;
&#13;
               This impact arises from the :tact that a large part ot the&#13;
      import requirements ot U. Congo progra.lllUIII will be procured in&#13;
      â&#128;¢t.ropoli ten Belgiwa. Tids will lead to a considerable expansion&#13;
      of incomes and expenditures within Belgiu which, 1t inflation is to&#13;
      be avoided, vUl 1n turn increase Delgium' s naeds to use foreign ex-&#13;
      change tor additional iaporta into â&#128;¢tropolitan Belgiu. These im-&#13;
      port&amp; will be partly- in the form. of raw aterials, partly in the form&#13;

              Belgiwa.&#13;
            Accordingly, the Â£'resident, Y.ho exp~ctis to be in Br-lBsels&#13;
     early next vee~, proposes to undertake discussions vith the Belgian&#13;
     authorities leading towards a possible International Bank operation&#13;
     to assist in the financing of the Congo development progral.liiDfl, on the&#13;
     basis of. the tl.:o principles toot I have jtlSt mentioned above.&#13;
&#13;
            As I h~.~e naid, the Congo davelopmnt progl"'al!!llll8 is a ten-year&#13;
     plan.   It has a.lrea1y been started and, at present, it is only the&#13;
     programme over the three years 1951-1953 that has been worked out&#13;
     with any degree of definitive:neas. At this ste.ge, therefore, any&#13;
     Bank fintmoing would be roleted to the three-year progral!'llle.&#13;
&#13;
               The total investment in tl".e public sector in this three-;f98.r&#13;
     programme is estimated at the equivalent of ~240 million. Local&#13;
     llt!lvingS in the Congo can cover Congo local expend! tures to the ex-&#13;
     tent of the equivalent of %~6~ million. This leaves $,172 million to&#13;
     be foun:~ from sow:'otJG external to the Congo. Of this $172 million,&#13;
     requiremonta for capital and coni3Ul'ller goods to be obtained from out-&#13;
     side the Belgian franc {aroa ...:ill !l"10llnt to e.pproxi!ff"'.tely $98 nti.llion.&#13;
     The balance of $74 million will eover imports into the Congo from&#13;
     â&#128;¢tropolitan belgium.&#13;
&#13;
             or the $98 million :requitÂ·ed to ~f!aet l:.be oost 0~ imports f'rom&#13;
     outside the Belgian franc ar'la, the Congo Authryl"i ti"" heve flnanoi:ng&#13;

     l'fancs) which represents the order of r~Bgni tude or possible Bank&#13;
     participation 1n the direct foreign exchange coste of the Congo&#13;
     development programme.&#13;
&#13;
              L$t me turn now to the impaot of the Congo progralllll0 on&#13;
     metropolitan Belgium. It ie oaloule.ted that the three-year Congo&#13;
     d4mtlopment progre.me will abst&gt;rb imports from â&#128;¢tropGlitsn BelgiWil&#13;
     equivalent in value to $74 million. The addition to DIBtropolitan&#13;
     Belgi1111l1 s incomes will very moh exceed this aoount and a substantial&#13;
     portion of these increased Belgian incomes will manifest themselves&#13;
     in a denand for additional 1:tr.ports into B9lgium. The euct. mgnitude&#13;
     ot tbia blpaet on Bâ&#128;¢lgiaâ&#128;¢ a foreign exchange :reaourcea baa yet to be&#13;
     worked out. It Ylll require detailed study' by the start or the Bank&#13;
     in consultation with the eeonolllie ataft" ot the Belgian Govern.nt.&#13;

&#13;
      I am theretoN aot, at th.ts ste.ge, able to iadioate the &amp;I!IOunt wbich the&#13;
      ~nagement  vould reco-.nd as appt'Opriate tor a Barllt loan in recognition&#13;
      or the effect of. the three-year progranne on the ecoDOm,y or metropolitan&#13;
      Bel.g1\111l.&#13;
&#13;
               I should uy, however, that the Management would propose to&#13;
      tit'lanoe the foreign exchange coats to metropolitan Belgium onl7 to the&#13;
      extent that we estiate that the impact would be felt by the gold aDII&#13;
      dollar ~eeouroea of belgium.&#13;
&#13;
              'fb.e justification for this combined operation lies in the&#13;
      desirability, in thfiJ lt!rmgemont's .,,iew, or assisting economic develop-&#13;
      ment in ths Lelgian Congo. The Bank would therefore look for assuraacea&#13;
      troll the Belgian GO\fef!lllll8nt that the goods of Belgian origin aottally&#13;
      needed for the three-yoe.r Congo devolo?ment progrartlm$ -will be Y!llde&#13;
      available from the production :poten"ti!ll of the metropole.&#13;
&#13;
               Thera are three furth..zr points which I should like to TJJ3.ke.&#13;
      First, tlle f4;ures wbio/1 ;, ~va ~ntlonad, of the extent of the in-&#13;
      "'estment in the thre-e-year Congo programme, relata only to invest-&#13;
      ment in the public sector. It is expected that substantial amounts&#13;
      will also be ill'lested .in the piÂ·ivate s actor and trase latter vill&#13;
      ha.ve the sams sort of affects on tbe eoono~ of the Inetropolitan&#13;
      countr;y. We Bre, howavar, ignoring these in our appriJaen and, t:Oere-&#13;
      fore, our aseessment of the 19xtent of t.he impact otâ&#128;¢ the progrlilmll$ on&#13;
      the eeonoD\Y of the roetropole will err substantially on the eonser-&#13;
      "'a tive side.&#13;
&#13;
              S&amp;eondly, i f any operation along the lin*a I oove inctiaated should&#13;
      be un;lertllken by the Bank, the "setup" is a :m.ttar for further study.&#13;
      The mecb&amp;:uies can be worked out in a variet.;r of Â·way~ and thara are&#13;
      considerations involved which will require discussion with tha Belgian&#13;
      authoritiea. At this stage the Management wished, boweTer, to inf'ora&#13;
      the Board of the princi-ples of the awroach which might be adopted by&#13;
      the   Pre~i,.lent   in his !'ortheomtng talks in BruMels.&#13;
&#13;
              Finally, I ohould add t:.ita t the calcul&amp; tions \Jhiah we heva so tar&#13;
      made nre n~oeasarily based on data W'hich are far from COUl.fJl&amp;te and&#13;
      recontmendations '!lith regard to definitiva iiUiDunts can only- bta mde&#13;
      aftar further study and. consultation .,ith the Belgi&amp;n authorities.&#13;
      However, the Management is ea tiafied tba t the sel:"9'ice of.' a loan in an,&#13;
      a110unt which the Management is likely to recommend, vill be well vithin&#13;
      the capacity of the Belgian eoonozru.&#13;

            Transcript of twenty fourth meeting of the
            Executive Directors, held on Wednesday, May 9, 1951
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            According to this transcript, in March
            1949, the Bank entered into a loan agreement with the
            Kingdom of Belgium for a loan in the amount of 16 million
            dollars. The proceeds of this loan were to be applied to
            meeting the foreign exchange cost of equipment to be
            imported into Belgium for the expansion of two Belgian steel
            mills and a power plant. In response to the approach of the
            Belgian ministry of the Colonies, the Bank indicated its
            interest, in principle, in participating in the financing of
            such a program. Further discussions took place with the
            Belgian authorities, in the course of which it emerged that
            the Belgian government will find some difficulty in
            guaranteeing any International Bank loan to the Belgian
            Congo unless the operation to be undertaken by the Bank made
            some recognition of the impact of the Congo development
            program in terms of foreign exchange, on the economy of
            metropolitan Belgium itself. The management feels that there
            are valid economic arguments for approaching the question of
            possible Bank participation in the Congo development program
            with two principles in minds: first, financing by the Bank,
            to the extent necessary, the direct and indirect foreign
            exchange costs of imports into the Congo from sources other
            than the Belgian franc area; and second, a recognition of
            the impact of the Congo's development program on the
            foreign exchange resources of metropolitan Belgium.
