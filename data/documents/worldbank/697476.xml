ARGENTINA&#13;
SECOND PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. THE SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1   Argentine provinces spent US$27.1 billion in 1993 (10.6% of Gross&#13;
Domestic Product and 40% of total public expenditure), and are fast becoming&#13;
the main providers of core public infrastructure and services.  Thus, the&#13;
efficiency, equity, and fiscal discipline of the provincial public sector are urgent&#13;
and important issues.&#13;
1.2   The First Provincial Development Project (PDP-I, Ln. 3280-AR,&#13;
US$200 million, FY91, with cofinancing by the Inter-American Development&#13;
Bank (IDB) for the same amount), is playing a key role in the Government's&#13;
provincial reform effort. Subprojects that contribute to institutional development&#13;
were funded as the essential step to raise income and reduce public expenditure.&#13;
For example, the provincial tax improvement subprojects of PDP-I provided the&#13;
foundation for the Federal Agreement (Pacto Fiscal) of 1993, an agreement of&#13;
the provinces with the national government to reform the provincial tax systems.&#13;
About 45 % of total subproject cost in PDP-I is for institutional development&#13;
subprojects (e.g., cadastres, revenue administration, management control, and&#13;
subproject evaluation systems) which contribute directly to the project's main&#13;
objective of improving provincial fiscal performance. Bank resources for PDP-I&#13;
are fully committed and US$56 million has been disbursed as of January 31,&#13;
1995. Projections show that disbursements are expected to reach US$120&#13;
million by the end of FY95, with full disbursement by December 31, 1996.&#13;
The Government has requested that a Second Provincial Development Project&#13;
(PDP-II) be prepared to maintain the momentum of PDP-I. PDP-II would&#13;
continue to assist in the transfer of fiscal and administrative reforms from the&#13;
national level to the provinces. This would involve deepening reforms in some&#13;
provinces and initiating them in others that have lagged behind in the process.&#13;
Population Growth and Distribution&#13;
1.3   Although Argentina's population and product are highly concentrated in&#13;
five jurisdictions (Buenos Aires, C6rdoba, Mendoza, Santa Fe, and the&#13;
Municipality of Buenos Aires), the rates of growth of population and Gross&#13;
Provincial Product (GPP) of some of the other provinces (especially those with&#13;
gas and oil resources) began to exceed those of the "big five" during the 1970s&#13;
and 1980s (see Tables 1 and 3 in Annex B). Thus, even though the general&#13;
economic malaise of the 1980s retarded both growth and spatial decentralization&#13;
of economic activities, the total concentration of GPP in these "big five"&#13;
jurisdictions declined from 82.5 % to 73.1 % between 1970 and 1989. Although&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
less dramatic, the same trend was observed for the population concentrated in&#13;
these jurisdictions, which declined from 72.4%  to 69.1 % between 1970 and&#13;
1991.&#13;
1.4   The provinces of Argentina are quite diverse in size and population&#13;
concentrations, as illustrated by Buenos Aires, the most populated province, and&#13;
Santa Cruz, one of the least populated ones. The population of Buenos Aires&#13;
Province (12.6 million in 1991) is about equal to that of Chile, and inhabits an&#13;
area about the size of Italy with a density of 41 people per square kilometer.&#13;
On the other hand, Santa Cruz Province has 160,000 inhabitants who live in an&#13;
area the size of the United Kingdom, with a density of less than one person per&#13;
square kilometer. Almost half of the total number of poor households (i.e.,&#13;
households with unsatisfied basic needs) live in the three provinces of Buenos&#13;
Aires, C6rdoba and Santa Fe, with 42% of the total population living in their&#13;
capital cities. On the other hand, the percentage of households with unsatisfied&#13;
basic needs as a proportion of the total population is higher in provinces with&#13;
smaller populations.&#13;
B. Government Structure for the Provision of Public Services&#13;
1.5   Argentina has a federal system  of government with three levels:&#13;
national, provincial, and municipal.  Until the adoption of the Federal&#13;
Constitution of 1853, provinces were sovereign in their own right. Under this&#13;
Constitution, provinces surrendered wide-ranging powers to the national&#13;
government; however, all powers not explicitly relinquished to the center&#13;
remained with the provinces. The recent revision of the Constitution in August&#13;
1994 did not introduce fundamental changes in Argentina's federal system.&#13;
Argentina's 23 provinces are autonomous entities governed by their own&#13;
constitutions (the Municipality of Buenos Aires is a separate entity).&#13;
1.6   In 1978, the national government began decentralization by assigning&#13;
responsibility for the provision of some additional services to provincial&#13;
governments (e.g., primary and secondary education, health care, water,&#13;
electricity, provincial roads). However, many of these services continued to be&#13;
provided centrally until 1991, when a major effort to complete the&#13;
decentralization process was initiated by the national government. In some&#13;
cases, the provinces have turned over these and other responsibilities to&#13;
municipalities.    Although  some  assignments  between  provinces  and&#13;
municipalities are still not definite, responsibilities for service provision are&#13;
basically as follows:  exclusively national government--defense, foreign&#13;
affairs, interprovincial transportation and trade regulation, mail, and&#13;
telecommunications; national and provincial governments--higher education,&#13;
preventive health, justice, security, economic development, major passenger and&#13;
cargo terminals, housing, electric and gas energy; provincial and municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
governments--elementary and secondary education, health care, water and&#13;
sewerage, regional and local roads, fire control; and predominantly municipal&#13;
governments--solid waste collection and disposal, local streets and drainage,&#13;
parks, water, markets, cemeteries, and land use planning and control. The&#13;
division of responsibilities between the national and the provincial governments&#13;
is relatively clearly delineated in Argentina, but the provincial/municipal&#13;
assignments are evolving rapidly as the provinces themselves decentralize.&#13;
C. Public Sector Financing and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations&#13;
1.7   As provided in the National Constitution, the national government has&#13;
the following sources of revenues: (a) resources allocated to it exclusively and&#13;
on a permanent basis (taxes on foreign trade and profits from the postal&#13;
service); (b) resources allocated permanently in conjunction with the provinces&#13;
(domestic taxes); and (c) resources allocated temporarily and on a shared basis&#13;
with the provinces (direct taxes in cases of national emergency). Categories (b)&#13;
and (c) have contributed approximately 80% of total national government tax&#13;
revenues, and have been the basis for the national/provincial governments'&#13;
revenue-sharing system. Before the Pacto Fiscal, the most important provincial&#13;
revenues were the turnover tax (gross sales tax), real estate tax, vehicle tax and&#13;
transfer tax (sellos), as well as the revenue transfers received from the national&#13;
government, as described below. The Pacto Fiscal established the real estate&#13;
tax and a final sales tax as the foundation for a modern provincial tax system.&#13;
1.8   Provincial governments in Argentina are highly dependent on transfers&#13;
from  higher governmental levels.  In 1992, national/provincial automatic&#13;
revenue sharing under the national law (hereafter, coparticipaci6n) reached&#13;
US$10 billion (US$12 billion including all automatic transfers), while provincial&#13;
own-source current revenues were US$8.4 billion. While of diminishing&#13;
importance, discretionary transfers from the national government to finance&#13;
provincial deficits and investments have been notorious in rewarding poor fiscal&#13;
performers among the provinces and distorting resource allocation. Although&#13;
the national government has explicitly sought to diminish the size of&#13;
discretionary transfers, in 1992 they still represented about 8 % of total&#13;
provincial revenues (compared with 19% in 1987) and remained vital revenue&#13;
sources for many smaller provinces. National transfers financed on average&#13;
59% of total provincial spending in 1992, ranging from a high of 92% of total&#13;
expenditures in the Province of La Rioja to a low of 50% in the Province of&#13;
Buenos Aires.&#13;
1.9   The prevailing national coparticipaci6n law allocates 57% of the most&#13;
important taxes collected to the provinces, such as the value-added tax, income&#13;
and asset taxes, and excise and fuel taxes. In August 1993, a floor of US$745&#13;
million per month was established for these transfers.  Distribution of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
coparticipaci6n revenues among provinces, codified by the coparticipacion law,&#13;
favors sparsely populated, underdeveloped provinces at the expense of the more&#13;
developed and densely populated provinces, the latter of which have a higher&#13;
concentration of households with unsatisfied basic needs.&#13;
1.10 With regard to the impact of national/provincial transfers, a recent Bank&#13;
study concluded that the regional redistribution of income probably has been&#13;
excessive in Argentina.'  Although data are not sufficient to evaluate the&#13;
efficiency of provincial expenditure programs (e.g., education, health, and&#13;
transport), there is enough evidence to suggest that serious inefficiencies exist&#13;
regarding expenditure types, especially regarding salaries. Thus, the issue is not&#13;
the level of provincial revenues but rather how efficiently these resources are&#13;
allocated.&#13;
D. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement&#13;
1.11 The principal lessons learned from PDP-I, the First Municipal&#13;
Development Project (MDP-I, Ln. 2920-AR, US$120, FY88) and other Bank&#13;
experience in lending for municipal development, include the importance of:&#13;
(a) making the review of technical proposals and procurement documents more&#13;
cost-effective; (b) contracting implementation specialists to assist the PEUs in&#13;
subproject implementation; (c) continuing to improve the implementation&#13;
capacity of the CEU and PEUs; and (d) developing a reasonable stock of fully&#13;
prepared subprojects to facilitate project launch and overall execution. Overall,&#13;
the process of subproject review by the CEU and PEUs in PDP-I has been quite&#13;
satisfactory for those provinces participating actively in the project.  The&#13;
improvement of the provinces' capacity to identify, evaluate, procure, and&#13;
supervise the completion of subprojects is an important accomplishment of PDP-&#13;
I, although there is still much room for improvement, especially in those&#13;
provinces that did not participate very actively in PDP-I. All of these lessons&#13;
have been incorporated into the design of the implementation arrangements for&#13;
PDP-II. (para. 2.21 to 2.35)&#13;
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.12 As stated in the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) report&#13;
presently under discussion and the previous CAS (presented to the Board on&#13;
March 1, 1994, Report P6161-AR), the Bank has been, and will remain, a&#13;
strong supporter of the ambitious Argentine reform program. Extending fiscal&#13;
and economic reforms to the provinces is now a vital element of this program,&#13;
since the recent upsurge in the provinces' fiscal imbalances could endanger the&#13;
Argentina: Reforms for Price Stability and Growth. Annex Chapter 11: Provincial Government&#13;
Finance. 1990.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
country's macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, due to decentralization, the&#13;
provinces now play an increasingly important role in the provision of key public&#13;
goods and services. The Bank strategy for provincial government reform seeks&#13;
to: (a) stabilize public finances and begin reforming provincial administrations,&#13;
while providing for urgently needed investments which improve fiscal balance&#13;
and are linked to sectoral reforms, and (b) improve the efficiency of delivering&#13;
public goods and services through a series of proposed sector operations (e.g.,&#13;
education, public health, roads, water supply, and agriculture). PDP-I and&#13;
PDP-II are umbrella operations covering all provinces and provide support for&#13;
institutional strengthening and small investments aimed at improving their fiscal&#13;
situations. In order to deepen the reform process, the Provincial Reform Loan&#13;
(PRL, Ln. 3836, US$300 million, FY95) and most future sector operations will&#13;
be targeted to support those provinces willing and able to implement major&#13;
structural reforms. This selectivity would be fundamental for leveraging Bank&#13;
resources to promote fiscal adjustment, while ensuring the success of these&#13;
operations with adequate provincial counterpart financing. Under this strategy,&#13;
the Bank would expect to be fully engaged in assisting five to seven of the&#13;
provinces, while the remaining provinces would have access to PDP-I and PDP-&#13;
II resources as a means to improve their overall fiscal performance, enabling&#13;
them to become eligible for future Bank support. Thus, PDP-I and PDP-II are&#13;
vital elements in the Bank's overall strategy as defined in the CAS.&#13;
1.13 PDP-II would also continue to complement other existing and proposed&#13;
Bank operations in the provinces as in PDP-I by: (a) improving the overall&#13;
institutional capacity of provincial governments, especially the ability to plan&#13;
and execute institutional development and investment subprojects;  (b)&#13;
maintaining and further strengthening the Provincial Executing Units (PEUs);&#13;
and (c) providing financial assistance for the preparation of other Bank&#13;
operations, as well as for the evaluation of pilot subprojects in one or more&#13;
provinces. PDP-II would complement PRL by providing additional incentives&#13;
for improved fiscal performance and financing essential institutional&#13;
development subprojects. However, PRL is an adjustment loan, and thus would&#13;
not be an alternative window for PDP-I or PDP-II, both of which finance&#13;
institutional development and discrete infrastructure investments. PDP-II would&#13;
also complement MDP-I and MDP-II (Ln. 3860-AR, US$210 million, FY95)&#13;
which seek to make municipalities more fiscally autonomous, thereby reducing&#13;
pressures for provincial transfers. Transfers to municipal governments represent&#13;
the second highest expenditure of provincial governments after personnel, and&#13;
have more than doubled from US$1.4 billion in 1991 to US$2.9 billion in 1993.&#13;
Thus, these municipal projects complement the main goal of the provincial&#13;
operations (PRL and PDP-I and II), making provincial and municipal operations&#13;
in Argentina parts of an integrated effort at strengthening subnational&#13;
governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.14 To maintain and continue the program of incentives for provincial fiscal&#13;
reform initiated under PDP-I, the Argentine Republic wants to accelerate the&#13;
implementation of PDP-II. This includes the financing of: (a) institutional&#13;
development subprojects vital to the implementation of the Pacto Fiscal reforms&#13;
and overall adjustment in the provinces; and (b) urgently needed infrastructure.&#13;
PDP-I resources (both Bank and IDB) are not sufficient to finance institutional&#13;
development and physical infrastructure subprojects (US$226 million) which the&#13;
provinces already have included in their Financial Action and Investment Plans&#13;
(FAIPs). Given this lack of resources, many provinces have not been able to&#13;
implement subprojects already initiated in other provinces to improve fiscal&#13;
performance (e.g., revenue administration, cadastres, financial administration).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origins&#13;
2.1   The proposed operation would be the second of its kind in Argentina.&#13;
It builds on the operational experience of PDP-I (Ln. 3280-AR) and would&#13;
complement at the provincial level the fiscal objectives of MDP-I (Ln. 2920-&#13;
AR) and MDP-II (Ln. 3860-AR).&#13;
2.2   The First Provincial Development Project has been widely accepted by&#13;
Argentine provinces. From a total of 24 jurisdictions, only one (Santa Cruz) did&#13;
not participate in PDP-I. In the Second Provincial Development Project all&#13;
provinces would participate, as Santa Cruz has already submitted an initial&#13;
agreement to be included in the program. The remaining 23 provinces not only&#13;
have agreed to participate in PDP-II but are already preparing the necessary&#13;
legal documents and have submitted subprojects costing US$85 million (26% of&#13;
total project cost), which would be funded under the new project. This gives&#13;
PDP-II a considerable advantage over PDP-I, since a stock of prepared&#13;
subprojects did not exist when PDP-1 was formulated.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.3   PDP-II's overall objective would be to continue to provide financial&#13;
support and incentives for provinces to undertake their own public sector&#13;
reform programs consistent with the national program. The specific&#13;
objectives are to:&#13;
(a)   assist the provinces in implementing appropriate financial&#13;
management reforms to:&#13;
(i)  generate current account surpluses (own-source revenue&#13;
enhancement and expenditure control) that together with&#13;
prudent borrowing may finance investment programs; and&#13;
(ii)  strengthen their capacity to plan, program, finance,&#13;
execute, and monitor investment programs that are&#13;
economically  efficient,  financially  sustainable,&#13;
institutionally manageable, and environmentally sound.&#13;
(b)   provide financing for institutional development and physical&#13;
investments that will promote provincial economic development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
2.4   The proposed operation would continue to finance the preparation and&#13;
implementation of Provincial Financial Action and Investrnent Plans (FAIPs),&#13;
to be proposed by provinces and approved by the national government's&#13;
Ministry of Interior and the Bank.&#13;
2.5   The project would finance a  'time-slice" of eligible provincial&#13;
expenditures, including civil works, goods, and consultants. It would have the&#13;
following main components:&#13;
(a)   Institutional Development: (approximately 35 % of total project&#13;
cost) including technical assistance, training, and equipment to&#13;
attain the project's objectives at both the national and provincial&#13;
government levels (inter alia, improving systems for revenue&#13;
administration, cadastres, integrated project evaluation, and&#13;
overall financial management and control). At the national level,&#13;
subprojects will include improving the coverage of the stock of&#13;
provincial debt in the Provincial Financial Management&#13;
Information System (PFMIS), training of provincial professional&#13;
personnel in the identification, evaluation, preparation, and&#13;
implementation of subprojects; and conducting studies on the&#13;
desirability and feasibility of the privatization of provincial public&#13;
entities (see para. 2.34 and Annex I for details).&#13;
(b)   Physical Investments: (approximately 57% of total project cost)&#13;
with emphasis on maintenance programs, rehabilitation of&#13;
existing works, and completion of unfinished works (as in PDP-&#13;
I), but also encompassing public infrastructure and facilities&#13;
(e.g., roads, drainage, water supply and sanitation, schools,&#13;
health posts) not eligible for financing under other Bank sectoral&#13;
projects.&#13;
(c)    Project Administration: (approximately 8 % of total project cost)&#13;
for the recurrent costs of project implementation at the provincial&#13;
level. These costs would not be financed under the loan.&#13;
D. Eligibility Criteria&#13;
2.6   To implement the project's objectives in 23 provinces and the&#13;
Municipality of Buenos Aires (hereafter, the "provinces"), each with unique&#13;
demographic, economic, physical, and political characteristics, it is essential that&#13;
the basic criteria necessary for effective implementation of project objectives be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
clear, easily determined, and fully accepted by all institutions involved in the&#13;
project's implementation.  Moreover, the eligibility criteria should ensure&#13;
adequate incentives for improved provincial fiscal performance and financial&#13;
management, especially modem budgeting and reporting systems. These basic&#13;
criteria would be defined at two levels: (a) provincial eligibility; and (b)&#13;
subproject eligibility.&#13;
Provincial Eligibility Criteria&#13;
2.7    While all provinces would be potential candidates for the project, each&#13;
participating province would have to meet the additional conditions of eligibility&#13;
specified in the Project Operations Manual (POM--see para. 3.1(a) and Annex&#13;
F). The POM would also provide detailed guidelines to the provinces for the&#13;
preparation of their FAIPs. Each province's FAIP would determine if, and for&#13;
what purposes, it would participate in the project. Approval by the CEU and&#13;
the Bank of a province's FAIP would be required for any project support to the&#13;
province. The FAIP would include the subproject's institutional arrangements&#13;
(including the organization of the PEU) and a specific action plan for: (a)&#13;
maintaining a current account surplus2; or (b) provincial revenue enhancement&#13;
and/or expenditure reduction that would result in a current account surplus&#13;
during the FAIP implementation period.&#13;
2.8    All provinces with an approved FAIP that have signed a subsidiary loan&#13;
agreement would be eligible for institutional development subprojects.&#13;
However, only those meeting the following additional financial performance&#13;
criteria would be eligible for new physical investments or completion of&#13;
unfinished works:&#13;
(a)    A current account surplus during the last executed budget period.&#13;
(b)    Total existing and proposed provincial debt must not result in a&#13;
total debt service obligation (amortization, interest, and other&#13;
financial charges) greater than 15% of total provincial current&#13;
revenues (excluding discretionary grants).&#13;
2     Current account surplus/deficit is defined as CR - CE, where CR is Total Current Revenues&#13;
excluding Discretionary Grants, and CE is Total Current Expenditures (See also Annex C).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Subproject Eligibility Criteria&#13;
2.9   The Government is implementing a significant decentralization of the&#13;
public sector, with an increasing transfer of responsibilities from the national&#13;
government to provincial governments. In this regard, the Government has&#13;
requested Bank support in many sector-specific areas for which provinces would&#13;
be the primary executing agencies. PDP-II should continue to be an "incubator"&#13;
for sectoral projects by financing subprojects that would increase provincial&#13;
capacity to identify, evaluate, and implement institutional development and&#13;
physical investment subprojects. To serve as incubator and also provide overall&#13;
incentives for provincial reform, PDP-II would finance subprojects in many&#13;
sectors. Public investment subprojects would be potentially eligible provided&#13;
that they are: (a) listed in the Project Operations Manual (POM) as eligible; (b)&#13;
included in an approved FAIP; and (c) shown to be technically consistent,&#13;
economically efficient, financially sustainable, and environmentally sound&#13;
according to the criteria defined in the Manual.&#13;
2.10   To ensure proper coordination and policy consistency between the&#13;
proposed operation and other sector-specific projects at the provincial level, the&#13;
following definitions would apply and be agreed at negotiations for inclusion in&#13;
the POM (para. 3.1 (j)):&#13;
(a)    When there exists an effective, sector-specific project with Bank&#13;
financing (e.g., water, health, education, transport) with&#13;
uncommitted funds for potentially eligible provinces, those&#13;
provinces would not receive financing for that sector under the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
(b)   Procedures would be established to ensure consistency of&#13;
investment subprojects with Bank sector strategies.&#13;
(c)    Financing would be provided only to provinces which have&#13;
included all of their externally financed projects in an FAIP&#13;
acceptable to the Secretariat for Assistance to the Provincial&#13;
Economic Reform (SAREP) of the Ministry of the Interior and&#13;
the Bank (para. 2.7).&#13;
E. Project Costs&#13;
2.11   The total estimated project cost is US$321 million, of which US$225&#13;
million (approximately 70%) would be financed by the Bank. A summary of&#13;
project costs is presented in Table 2.1.&#13;

2.12   Project costs are expressed in US dollars due to the parity between the&#13;
dollar and the peso. Since the proposed project would finance a "time-slice" of&#13;
provincial investments, these cost estimates are projections based on the current&#13;
subproject proposals for 26% of total project cost and PDP-I experience. As&#13;
price and other contingencies are not pertinent for such projections, they have&#13;
not been included. Project administration includes the recurrent costs of the&#13;
PEUs in 24 provinces for 6 years (although they will not be eligible for&#13;
financing).&#13;
2.13  For the total project, foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$121.8&#13;
million equivalent (37.9% of the total), of which approximately US$36.5 million&#13;
is for institutional strengthening and US$85.3 million for public works.&#13;
F. Allocation of Loan Proceeds by Province&#13;
2.14 PDP-II will continue to reward good performance with access to credit.&#13;
However, without some initial allocation of loan funds among the provinces, a&#13;
few very agile provinces might quickly commit the full amount of the loan. To&#13;
avoid this problem and also provide more equitable access of all provinces to&#13;
intemational assistance, loan funds will be allocated in two stages. In the first&#13;
stage (lasting one year from the date of signing), 56% of the available funds&#13;
would be assigned to each of the 24 provinces according to the quotas&#13;
established in the distribution of revenue sharing from the national government&#13;
to the provinces. The remaining 44% would go into a "pool". Provinces would&#13;
have access to this pool on a first-come-first-served basis after they have fully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
committed the resources of their initial assignment, provided that they meet the&#13;
other eligibility criteria. In the second stage, those funds not committed during&#13;
stage one would revert to the fund pool, which, together with the initially&#13;
unallocated funds, would be allocated on the basis of demand. Based on the&#13;
above criteria, the initial allocation of loan proceeds would be as shown in Table&#13;
2.2 (See also Annex D).&#13;

2.15  Although this initial allocation of available resources would take place&#13;
irrespective of whether a province meets all of the eligibility criteria for new&#13;
physical investments (para. 2.8), only those provinces meeting these criteria&#13;
would be eligible for new physical investments or completion of unfinished&#13;
works.&#13;
G. Financing Plan&#13;
2.16 The total project cost of US$321 million equivalent would be financed&#13;
according to the plan shown in Table 2.3. The proposed Bank loan of US$225&#13;
million equivalent would finance approximately 70% of total costs.   The&#13;
provincial governments would provide counterpart funding for a total of US$96&#13;
million equivalent, and assume the full cost of debt servicing, including the&#13;
foreign exchange risk. Experience from PDP-I showed this plan to be fully&#13;
satisfactory. The IDB may also finance a parallel operation as soon as its part&#13;
of PDP-I is more fully disbursed.&#13;
Table 2.3: Financing Plan&#13;

Total                                  321            100&#13;
2.17 The aggregate level of external financing (70%) is justified because of:&#13;
(a) the need to provide strong incentives to improve financial management&#13;
performance to meet the project's objectives; (b) the strong long-term&#13;
institutional development impact the project is expected to promote; and (c) the&#13;
limited domestic financing alternatives.&#13;
2.18 The loan would be made at the Bank's standard variable rate, with&#13;
repayment in 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years of grace with level&#13;
repayments of principal.&#13;
2.19 All proceeds of the Bank loan would be onlent to provincial governments&#13;
eligible under this loan with the same terms and conditions as Bank lending to&#13;
the Argentine Republic (para. 2.18). Provinces would assume the cross-&#13;
currency risk and would guarantee repayment with their shared funds (para.&#13;
3.1(d)). In addition, each province would pay a charge of up to 2% of the&#13;
disbursed loan amount for recovery of the entire administrative cost of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
financial intermediary and the cost of CEU consultants to ensure that provincial&#13;
project components would not result in a fiscal burden for the national&#13;
government. As the provinces are paying for the CEU, and depend on it for the&#13;
review of their subprojects, they have a strong incentive to ensure that it is cost-&#13;
effective, and have actively pursued this goal in PDP-I. The execution of&#13;
Subsidiary Loan Agreements with one or more provinces, representing an initial&#13;
allocation of loan proceeds equivalent to not less than 4% of the amount of the&#13;
Bank's loan, would be a condition of effectiveness (para. 3.2(b)).  Other&#13;
conditions of effectiveness would be that the province(s) referred to in the&#13;
preceding sentence have taken all actions necessary to (i) exempt all contracts&#13;
for goods, works and services to be financed under the loan from all legal and&#13;
regulatory provisions limiting the international procurement of goods, works,&#13;
and services; and (ii) establish, provide funds and other resources for, and staff&#13;
the PEU of each province in terms satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.2(c)). Each&#13;
participating province would pay loan commitment fees as defined in the POM.&#13;
2.20 The following would be conditions of disbursement for all participating&#13;
provinces (para. 3.3):&#13;
(a)   establishment and adequate staffing of the PEU (see also para.&#13;
2.25);&#13;
(b)   execution of a satisfactory Subsidiary Loan Agreement;&#13;
(c)   exemption of all contracts for goods, works and services to be&#13;
financed under the loan from all legal and regulatory provisions&#13;
limiting the international procurement of goods, works, and&#13;
services;&#13;
(d)   approval of the subproject by the Borrower through the CEU, as&#13;
provided in the POM;&#13;
(e)   inclusion of the subproject in an FAIP that has been approved by&#13;
the Bank as provided for in the POM;&#13;
(f)   that no financing for a subproject is available to the province&#13;
under another signed Bank-financed sector-specific loan;&#13;
(g)   that the Bank has received a satisfactory plan of action to remedy&#13;
any irregularities or deficiencies noted by any audit report;&#13;
(h)   satisfactory legal opinion on the validity of the Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
H. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
2.21  Implementation arrangements would remain essentially the same as PDP-&#13;
I, except for changes to incorporate lessons of experience and to better manage&#13;
risk (para. 2.33 to 2.35).&#13;
2.22 The borrower would be the Argentine Republic, and its Ministry of&#13;
Economy, through SAREP. The Central Executing Unit (CEU) would remain&#13;
located in SAREP, and would be the national executing agency. The CEU&#13;
would retain its responsibility for overall project management, including&#13;
orientation and technical assistance to the provinces (directly and through the&#13;
POM) in the preparation, approval, and monitoring of FAIPs, as well as for all&#13;
financial and reporting transactions with the Bank. The CEU would also retain&#13;
its responsibility for all aspects concerning subproject evaluation, approval, and&#13;
procurement (para. 2.35), as well as reporting and obtaining Bank approval of&#13;
acquisitions and disbursements. The CEU would also continue to provide&#13;
proper coordination and policy consistency between the proposed operation and&#13;
other sector-specific projects proposed by the provinces (see Annex H for a&#13;
detailed description of the CEU's organization, human resources, and&#13;
responsibilities).&#13;
2.23 The CEU would continue to be subordinated to SAREP, and its&#13;
Secretary would be the CEU's General Coordinator. The General Coordinator&#13;
would be assisted by an Executive Coordinator, who will be fully dedicated to&#13;
project implementation. The General Coordinator would discuss all relevant&#13;
project aspects with the Credit Committee, which would be comprised of three&#13;
provincial ministers of finance, as in PDP-I.&#13;
2.24 The CEU would implement the national government's component of the&#13;
project, and also review subprojects. As the organizational structure of the&#13;
CEU under PDP-I has proved to serve adequately the functions described above,&#13;
the same general structure would be maintained for PDP-I1--although there&#13;
would be some fine-tuning to increase cost-effectiveness.&#13;
2.25 The PEUs would be responsible for formulation, implementation, and&#13;
supervision of their FAIPs. Actual execution of physical investments would be&#13;
undertaken by provincial government agencies according to procedures&#13;
established in the POM  (para. 3.1(a) and Annex F). As the objectives and&#13;
implementation procedures of the provincial subprojects are the same as in PDP-&#13;
I, the overall structure of the PEUs would remain unchanged (see para. 2.20 (a)&#13;
and Annex H  for PEU's organization and staffing).  They would be&#13;
subordinated to the provincial Ministers of Finance who would also serve as the&#13;
PEU General Coordinators. They would be assisted by a full-time Executive&#13;
Committee in the formulation and implementation of FAIPs. The General&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Coordinator would provide the necessary political, technical, and administrative&#13;
support for the implementation of the project.&#13;
2.26 The PEUs would perform the following key functions: (a) promotion of&#13;
provincial institutional development; (b) proposal, evaluation, and monitoring&#13;
of financial reforms and investment programs (including environmental&#13;
screening and analysis);  and (c) administrative control (including Bank&#13;
reporting requirements).&#13;
2.27  There are important distinctions between the CEU and PEUs regarding&#13;
their objectives and functions. The PEUs would have a permanent function&#13;
within provincial governments, providing improved planning, budgeting, and&#13;
supervision of financial management for the provinces as an overall institution.&#13;
Furthermore, the PEUs would continue to provide support for preparation and&#13;
implementation of projects for the Bank and other lenders. Therefore, the&#13;
project would seek to strengthen PEUs as part of the project's objectives to&#13;
implement provincial financial management reforms and to strengthen financial&#13;
management capacity.  Although the CEU  would have some permanent&#13;
functions (e.g., information system for monitoring provincial financial&#13;
management performance), most of the short-term functions of the CEU's&#13;
operation would be transitory, lasting only as long as the project. As in PDP-1,&#13;
the CEU would contract with other entities to review specific types of technical&#13;
proposals requiring specialized expertise.  For example, in PDP-I, the CEU&#13;
contracted with the national tax collection service to review the proposals for&#13;
provincial tax collection systems for the 2,000 largest taxpayers which was&#13;
adopted by 15 provinces, since it was this entity that had adapted the provincial&#13;
system from one implemented at the national level.&#13;
2.28  Under PDP-I, the provinces have preferred to keep the size of their&#13;
permanent staffs relatively small (usually less than 10) and to use other entities&#13;
of the provincial government or short-term consultants to perform some of the&#13;
more specialized tasks. For example, a well coordinated province could use the&#13;
technical support of existing ministries (e.g., environment or public works) to&#13;
carry out many of the functions, leaving only basic core functions with the&#13;
PEU. Each province would submit an organizational structure to the CEU for&#13;
its approval. In cases in which consultants would have to be contracted, Bank&#13;
review and approval would also be necessary (see para. 2.27, 2.31, 19, Annex&#13;
H).&#13;
2.29  Adequate Bank supervision of the proposed project would require review&#13;
of all provincial FAIPs. These FAIPs would include investment proposals in&#13;
many sectors, and their adequate review would entail evaluation of their&#13;
consistency with general and sectoral development policies in discussion with&#13;
or agreed to by the Bank. Efforts would be made to decentralize project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
supervision as much as possible by using consultants in Argentina to review&#13;
technical proposals and procurement documents when feasible. The project's&#13;
supervision plan is summarized in Annex G.&#13;
2.30 Successful implementation of project objectives also will require intense&#13;
monitoring of actual performance by both the CEU and the Bank. To facilitate&#13;
this supervision, the CEU will prepare and furnish to the Bank a progress report&#13;
on project execution of such scope and detail as the Bank shall reasonably&#13;
request not later than March 31 and September 30 of each year (para. 3.1(c)).&#13;
The terms of reference for a revised format of these reports will be discussed&#13;
at negotiations. The Government already has made substantial progress in&#13;
implementing its Provincial Financial Management Information System&#13;
(PFMIS), and it would continue to monitor provincial financial performance and&#13;
to evaluate compliance with FAIP agreements on a quarterly basis, as in PDP-I.&#13;
The Information System would be expanded to permit adequate monitoring of&#13;
provincial indebtedness. The Bank would also monitor the implementation of&#13;
the FAIPs through its supervision missions. In addition, the Government and&#13;
the Bank have agreed to exchange views annually on the status of project&#13;
implementation, particularly regarding (a) the CEU and PEUs performance in&#13;
project implementation procedures agreed with the Bank, and (b) adjustments&#13;
in the POM that may be required to improve implementation of project&#13;
objectives (para. 3.1(e)).&#13;
2.31    The Central Executing Unit (CEU) recommended the following&#13;
strategy for ensuring adequate environrmental management and analysis by the&#13;
provinces, based on its preliminary survey of the provinces' capacities and "felt&#13;
needs." The environmental analysis of eligible subprojects would continue to&#13;
be done as specified in the POM in accordance with Bank procedures. As part&#13;
of their FAIPs, provinces would be required to indicate: (a) the nature and&#13;
extent of the environmental analysis that would be conducted; (b) the provincial&#13;
entity responsible for such analysis (e.g., ministry, secretariat, PEU, etc.); and&#13;
(c) the technical capacity of such a provincial entity. If this capacity is not fully&#13;
adequate, the province could be required to include as part of its FAIP a&#13;
subproject aimed at strengthening the enviromnental analysis capacity of the&#13;
designated provincial entity.  The CEU  would continue to evaluate the&#13;
environmental management and analytical capacity of the provincial entities&#13;
responsible for analyzing the environmental impact of eligible subprojects. The&#13;
CEU would also continue to be responsible for supervising the environmental&#13;
analysis of subprojects submitted by the provinces, either using in-house&#13;
expertise or contracting consultants as required.&#13;
2.32 The POM would provide specific criteria for determining the type of&#13;
environmental analyses required. Only, those subprojects with considerable&#13;
environmental impact, as specified in the POM, would undergo detailed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
environmental impact analysis, for which Terms of Reference (TORs) would be&#13;
prepared by the PEU and approved by the CEU. The CEU would supervise the&#13;
execution of these studies and approve their conclusions. The CEU would also&#13;
ensure that all measures leading to mitigation of the environmental impact&#13;
recommended by these studies are adequately incorporated in the subprojects.&#13;
Individual consultants or consulting firms could be hired as needed to conduct&#13;
these environmental studies (para. 3.1(i)).&#13;
2.33 Several lessons of experience from PDP-I, MDP-I, and other Bank&#13;
experience in lending for municipal development (see para. 1.11 and Annex A&#13;
for details) would be incorporated to streamline project execution. To increase&#13;
the cost-effectiveness of review of technical proposals and procurement&#13;
documents, thresholds for prior review by the CEU and the Bank will be&#13;
carefully reviewed in the development of the POM so as to balance cost with&#13;
risk. In addition, procedures for review of procurement documents will be&#13;
streamlined, and all provinces will be required to use printed and bound&#13;
standard procurement documents approved by the Bank (para. 2.36), copies of&#13;
which will be included in the POM. To improve subproject management, the&#13;
POM will require that all subprojects present a timetable for all main stages of&#13;
subproject execution in a specified format. These timetables are expected to&#13;
provide the subproject tracking system developed in PDP-I with more reliable&#13;
information, thereby permitting more adequate projections needed to plan&#13;
subproject review by the CEU. A significant stock of subprojects (26% of the&#13;
total amount of the loan) has already been  identified.   Contracting&#13;
implementation specialists to assist the PEUs in subproject implementation will&#13;
be facilitated by expanding and updating the consultant roster developed in PDP-&#13;
I.&#13;
2.34 In addition, the CEU will design the following subprojects to improve&#13;
its implementation capacity and that of the PEUs (for short descriptions, see&#13;
Annex I). TORs have been prepared for each of these subprojects and were&#13;
discussed at negotiations. One such subproject will involve improving the&#13;
coverage on the stock of provincial debt in PFMIS, not only for macroeconomic&#13;
management but also for the calculation of creditworthiness (para. 2.8) and&#13;
project performance indicators (See Annex G). Another subproject will involve&#13;
training of both national government and provincial professional personnel in the&#13;
identification, evaluation, preparation, and implementation of subprojects with&#13;
special emphasis on areas shown to need improvement in PDP-I (e.g., tracking&#13;
performance in meeting implementation schedules and cost estimation). Bank&#13;
approval of the technical proposal for a subproject to provide project&#13;
management training to provincial professional personnel will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness (para. 3.2(d)). This training will cover the following topics:&#13;
project  identification,  evaluation,  preparation   (including   costing),&#13;
implementation, and monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
2.35  These centrally managed subprojects normally would be financed in the&#13;
same way as the CEU, i.e., by the provinces.  In addition, the CEU may&#13;
submit other subproject proposals for approval by the Bank for institutional&#13;
development subprojects benefitting all or the majority of the provinces. For&#13;
example, PDP-I financed the policy work for the reform of the provincial tax&#13;
and pension systems and the preparation of PDP-II. The POM will specify the&#13;
procedures for identifying, screening, approving, and executing these&#13;
subprojects, including cost-sharing among the provinces.&#13;
I. Procurement&#13;
2.36 Procurement would be undertaken by the CEU and up to 24 provinces.&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would use the Bank issued Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents for the procurement of works and goods, and Local&#13;
Competitive Bidding (LCB) would be based on agreed standard bidding&#13;
documents for the procurement of works and goods. For complex, time-based&#13;
assignments, the standard form contract issued by the Bank would be used. All&#13;
of these documents would be included in the POM, and approval of the POM&#13;
by the Borrower in terms satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness (para. 3.2(e)). In addition, for large or complex works above&#13;
US$10.0 million, such as cadastre works, prequalification of the bidders would&#13;
be a requirement.&#13;
2.37  Contracts for civil works expected to cost US$5 million or more (to&#13;
account for approximately US$91.2 million, or 28% of total project costs) and&#13;
for goods expected to cost US$350,000 or more (to account for approximately&#13;
US$25.8 million, or 8% of total project costs) would be awarded on the basis&#13;
of ICB procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for works&#13;
expected to cost US$350,000 or more, but less than US$5 million (to account&#13;
for approximately US$73.4 million, or 23 % of total project costs), and contracts&#13;
for goods expected to cost more than US$100,000, but less than US$350,000&#13;
(approximately US$30.6 million, or 10% of total project costs), would be&#13;
awarded on the basis of LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Procurement&#13;
for works costing less that US$350,000 (approximately US$5.2 million, or 2%&#13;
of total project costs) and goods costing less that US$100,000 (approximately&#13;
US$3.2 million, or 1% of total project costs) would be carried out through&#13;
international or local shopping involving at least three price quotations.&#13;
Consultant services, expected to cost approximately US$60.6 million, or 19%&#13;
of total project costs, would be procured in accordance with Bank's Guidelines&#13;
for the use of Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers. Training expenditures&#13;
would be approximately US$5 million or 2% of the total project costs. These&#13;
arrangements are summarized in Table 2.4.&#13;

2.38 It is expected that rehabilitation, completion of works, and new&#13;
investments would be undertaken through contracts with private firms, in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines. To ensure that the agreed procurement&#13;
procedures are properly carried out, the CEU and the Bank would review ex-&#13;
ante all procurement procedures, documents, bid evaluations and contract&#13;
awards for ICB procurement of goods and works during the entire project&#13;
implementation period.  In addition, the CEU  would review  ex-ante the&#13;
procedures for all other procurement of goods, works and consulting services&#13;
in each province. The Bank would review ex-ante all terms of reference for&#13;
consulting assignments (regardless of their estimated cost), as well as all single-&#13;
source contracts and consultancies of a critical nature. However, the Bank&#13;
would review ex-ante only the TORs of those contracts: in which (i) individual&#13;
consultants are hired on a competitive basis for amounts less than US$50,000&#13;
or (ii) consulting firms are hired on a competitive basis for amounts less than&#13;
US$100,000. In all other cases (including all single-source contracts and&#13;
consultancies of a critical nature), the Bank would review ex-ante all documents&#13;
of each contract. Prior Bank and CEU review of procurement procedures of&#13;
work, goods and consulting services is summarized in Table 2.5. Following the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
procedures defined in this table, the Bank would review e.x-ante about 64% of&#13;
the total cost of all procurement done under the project.&#13;
2.39  In all cases, however, the Bank would review contracts awarded under&#13;
LCB, international and local shopping procedures, and consultant selections on&#13;
an ex-post basis by sampling. If it were determined that procurement was not&#13;
carried out following agreed procedures, no expenditures for such items would&#13;
be financed from the proceeds of the loan, the Bank would cancel the&#13;
corresponding loan amount, and the Special Account would be reimbursed&#13;
accordingly by the Borrower. This effort should not only streamline project&#13;
execution but also reduce the Bank's supervision burden.  However, if a&#13;
particular province fails to comply with the agreed procedures, they could be&#13;
required to return to ex-ante review.&#13;
2.40 The capacity of the CEU and PEUs for effective implementation review&#13;
of procurement documents has improved greatly during the execution of PDP-I,&#13;
and there is now a strong core of professionals in the CEU. The experience of&#13;
PDP-I showed procurement procedures to be antiquated and cumbersome in&#13;
most provinces.  To help the provinces modernize and streamline their&#13;
procurement procedures and laws, PDP-II will finance studies to identify the&#13;
chief sources of delay in the procurement process and efforts to adopt measures&#13;
to reduce them.&#13;

J. Disbursements&#13;
2.41  The POM will specify that the CEU would continue to monitor financing&#13;
over the life of the project to assure that overall 70:30 Bank-provincial financing&#13;
is maintained as in PDP-I.  As part of its annual project implementation&#13;
review, the Bank would evaluate its participation in total project financing.&#13;
2.42 To withdraw the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan, the following&#13;
categories and disbursement percentages are proposed:&#13;
(a)  100% of total expenditures for consultant services, training, and audits,&#13;
including travel expenses related to these services;&#13;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for works and goods under all categories;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)  75% of local expenditures for works and goods purchased locally.&#13;
2.43  A Special Account in US dollars, and with an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$7 million, would be established in the Banco de la Naci6n Argentina. An&#13;
initial deposit of up to US$3.5 million will be made and the full amount of the&#13;
authorized allocation will be released when disbursements reach a level of&#13;
US$25 million. The Special Account would be managed by the CEU. All&#13;
disbursements against contracts for less than US$5 million for works, for less&#13;
than US$350,000 for goods and services, for less than US$100,000 for&#13;
consultant firms, and for less than US$50,000 for individual consultants, and for&#13;
all training expenditures would be made on the basis of certified Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOEs). The documentation for SOEs would not be sent to the&#13;
Bank but would be retained by the CEU and made available for inspection by&#13;
Bank staff.  All other disbursements would be made against standard&#13;
documentation.&#13;
2.44 Retroactive financing for expenditures incurred after August 26, 1994&#13;
(but not earlier than 12 months before loan signing) in an amount not to exceed&#13;
US$20.0 million (9% of the Loan amount) is recommended.&#13;
2.45  Formal agreement by the national government and a participating&#13;
province for implementation of the province's FAIP would be made through a&#13;
Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank. The FAIP would include&#13;
specific subprojects that would be potentially eligible for project financing.&#13;
However, at the time of FAIP approval and the signing of the Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement, detailed appraisal of each subproject may not be completed and&#13;
approved. Therefore, each subproject would have specific Bank approval (based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
on its full technical, economic, financial, and environmental appraisal) before&#13;
it would be eligible for disbursements from the Loan Account.&#13;
2.46  Based on experience from PDP-I, a disbursement period of six years is&#13;
proposed (see Annex J), the same as the regional disbursement profile. The&#13;
expected completion date would be December 31, 2001, and the closing date&#13;
would be June 30, 2002. The time required to commit and disburse the loan&#13;
will depend on the provinces' financial capacity to provide counterpart funding&#13;
and institutional capacity to propose, appraise, and execute subprojects that are&#13;
economically efficient, financially sustainable, and environmentally sound.&#13;
Counterpart funds should not pose a problem since the proposed project's&#13;
financing for real investments by the provinces would represent Bank financing&#13;
for only about 1 % of the total real investment program of the provinces for six&#13;
years (assuming 1993 investment levels--see also Annex C). Rather, the key to&#13;
implementation success and timely disbursements would depend on the&#13;
institutional capacity to design, implement, and supervise investments which are&#13;
consistent with Bank guidelines. Especially important in this regard is the&#13;
supervision of the CEU to assure that the provinces follow the procedures&#13;
established in the POM.&#13;
2.47  Regarding  provincial  institutional capacity  to  generate  timely&#13;
disbursements, approximately 36% (US$66.1 million) of total physical&#13;
investments (US$181.7 million) are expected to be allocated for provincial&#13;
maintenance programs and rehabilitation investments implemented under LCB&#13;
procedures. These would have less demanding appraisal requirements than&#13;
larger, new investments. It may be expected, therefore, that relatively small&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation investments may be implemented quickly while&#13;
larger subprojects are still under preparation. Based on a six-year disbursement&#13;
profile, and assuming that the loan would become effective on June 15, 1995,&#13;
the project's completion date would be December 31, 2001, and the proposed&#13;
closing date June 30, 2002. If the project were executed more rapidly than the&#13;
six-year profile, the shorter execution period would increase the benefits of the&#13;
project, and indicate that the provinces have the potential to mobilize more&#13;
resources for investments efficiently.&#13;
K. Accounts and Audits&#13;
2.48  An audit of the financial status of the program would take place once a&#13;
year for the CEU components and for each participant province. The audit&#13;
would be carried out by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, under&#13;
TORs similiar to those used in PDP-I. The audit reports would be sent to the&#13;
Bank not more than four months after the end of the calendar year. The report&#13;
would include, inter alia, specific opinions on: (a) sources of proceeds and&#13;
their use; (b) SOEs; and (c) implementation of contracting clauses, including the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
application of eligibility criteria, and compliance with procurement procedures&#13;
and other financing conditions included in the POM (para. 3. l(h)). The Special&#13;
Account would also be similiarly audited.&#13;
L. Project Benefits&#13;
2.49 There are four main benefits: (a) fiscal, by maintaining incentives for&#13;
provincial fiscal reform initiated under PDP-I and financing institutional&#13;
development subprojects that are vital for overall provincial adjustment; (b)&#13;
financial, by improving provincial creditworthiness;  (c) institutional, by&#13;
enhancing the capacity of provinces to plan, program, implement, and monitor&#13;
efficiently resource mobilization and allocation; and (d) socio-economic, by&#13;
improving infrastructure and service delivery. In summary, the project would&#13;
contribute to the Government's overall macroeconomic goals of efficiency,&#13;
equity, and stability, since it would improve the efficiency of the increasingly&#13;
important provincial public sector.&#13;
M. Financial Impact&#13;
2.50  Beneficial financial impacts are at the very core of the project's&#13;
objectives. By conditioning access to project financing on strict creditworthiness&#13;
criteria, the project would provide an incentive for improved provincial financial&#13;
performance. The institutional development subproject will provide an effective&#13;
means for the provinces to respond to this incentive.&#13;
N. Economic Impact&#13;
2.51 The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the project's investment&#13;
components was estimated based on the estimated rates of return for five&#13;
approved PDP-I subprojects and on estimates for a preliminary sample of 18&#13;
subprojects proposed for PDP-II (Annex E). The results show an economic rate&#13;
of return of 20. 1 % for approximately 38% of the total project cost represented&#13;
in the PDP-II sample.&#13;
0. Poverty Impact&#13;
2.52  Successful implementation of the proposed project would have the&#13;
following social benefits: (a) employment generation in the construction sector&#13;
and (b) improved physical and social infrastructure. Using the estimate of 30%&#13;
as the cost of labor in the total cost of civil works (US$169.8 million) and the&#13;
average monthly wage of construction workers at roughly US$200 equivalent,&#13;
project implementation would generate about 21,000 person-years of&#13;
construction employment.  The physical rehabilitation of provincial hospitals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
and schools, which was in great demand in PDP-I and is expected to continue&#13;
in PDP-II, would benefit mostly lower-income segments of the population.&#13;
P. Environmental Impact&#13;
2.53  The proposed project is classified as category B. For most subprojects,&#13;
the environmental impact is expected to be neutral or positive which is due to&#13;
the fact that a large proportion would either be maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
or completion of existing or unfinished works. However, regardless of their&#13;
nature, all investments would need to comply fully and be consistent with Bank&#13;
environmental policies and conditions, including the preparation of&#13;
environmental impact statements when required. Explicit conditions would be&#13;
defined in the POM.&#13;
Q. Program Risks and Safeguards&#13;
2.54 The experience gained in risk management during the first project should&#13;
prove quite useful in the second operation. The risks identified in the previous&#13;
project were: lack of interest by the provinces in carrying out the required fiscal&#13;
reforms, discontinuity in political commitment to the project, unfavorable&#13;
macroeconomic conditions during its execution (including significant increases&#13;
in national/provincial transfers), and implementation delays. The safeguard&#13;
against these risks is a competitive system of access to loan resources based on&#13;
performance.  Those provinces that enter earlier and perform better (i.e.,&#13;
develop the institutions and generate current account surpluses) would receive&#13;
more resources.  This safeguard proved effective in the project under&#13;
implementation. In addition, steps taken to further strengthen the CEU and&#13;
PEUs to incorporate the lessons of experience of PDP-I in the design of&#13;
implementation arrangements of PDP-II should reduce the likelihood of&#13;
implementation delays. Also, subprojects representing 26% of the total loan&#13;
amount have been prepared. Although program risks are similar to the ones in&#13;
PDP-I, the institutional and macroeconomic environment for PDP-II is more&#13;
favorable.&#13;
&#13;

III. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
3.1 - During negotiations, the following agreements were reached:&#13;
(a)   the project would be implemented accordance with the Project&#13;
Operations Manual (POM), satisfactory to the Bank, which would&#13;
not be amended without the Bank's prior consent (para.&#13;
2.7, 2.25);&#13;
(b)   the Central Execution Unit (CEU) would continue to be&#13;
adequately staffed and otherwise supported in the implementation&#13;
of its responsibility under the project (para. 2.22);&#13;
(c)   the CEU will prepare and furnish to the Bank a progress report&#13;
on project execution of such scope and detail as the Bank shall&#13;
reasonably request not later than March 31 and September 30 of&#13;
each year (para. 2.30).&#13;
(d)   all proceeds of the Bank loan would be onlent to eligible&#13;
provinces under the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan,&#13;
with each participating province's revenue sharing serving as a&#13;
guarantee for repayment of subloans (para. 2.19);&#13;
(e)   the national government and the Bank would exchange views&#13;
annually on the status of project implementation (para. 2.30);&#13;
(f)   procurement would be carried out in accordance with Bank&#13;
guidelines (para. 2.37-2.40);&#13;
(g)   the national government would open and maintain, in US dollars,&#13;
a Special Account (para. 2.43);&#13;
(h)   audit arrangements acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.48);&#13;
(i)   the CEU and PEUs would carry out environmental analysis&#13;
studies, as specified in the POM, in a manner consistent with the&#13;
Bank's environmental policies and procedures (para. 2.32); and&#13;
(j)   the national government would provide proper coordination and&#13;
policy consistency between the proposed operation and other&#13;
sector-specific projects proposed by the provinces, as defined in&#13;
the POM (para. 2.10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
3.2   The following would be Conditions of Effectiveness:&#13;

(b)   the execution of Subsidiary Loan Agreements with one or more&#13;
provinces, representing an initial allocation of loan proceeds&#13;
equivalent to not less than 4% of the amount of the Bank's loan&#13;
(para. 2.19);&#13;
(c)   that the province(s) referred to in para. 3.2(b) have taken all&#13;

3.4   Reconunendation.  With the above assurances and conditions, the&#13;
proposed project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$225 million&#13;
equivalent, to be repaid over a period of 15 years, including a grace period of&#13;
5 years of grace with level repayments of principal, at the Bank's standard&#13;
variable interest rate and fees. Retroactive financing for expenditures incurred&#13;
after August 26, 1994 (but not earlier than 12 months before loan signing) in an&#13;
amount not to exceed US$20.0 million (9% of the Loan amount) is&#13;
recommended.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -                      Annex A&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED AND PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE&#13;
SECTOR&#13;
1.    This annex draws on the lessons of the First Provincial Development&#13;
Project (PDP-I, Ln. 3280-AR) and the First Municipal Development Project&#13;
(MDP-I, Ln. 2920-AR), as well as the Bank-wide municipal development and&#13;
technical assistance projects.&#13;
Brief Description of the Subprojects Financed by PDP-I&#13;
2.    Including subprojects financed by both the IDB and the Bank, the total&#13;
cost of Institutional Development subprojects under PDP-I is US$257 million&#13;
(44.7%), compared with US$318 million (55.3%) for physical investments. Of&#13;
the total amount of the Institutional Development component, slightly over half&#13;
(54.1%) went to the cadastre subprojects in 18 of the 23 provinces to improve&#13;
returns from the real estate tax (Table 1). The estimated internal financial rate&#13;
of return for cadastre subprojects is 72.3% (Table 3). In addition, the PDP-I&#13;
is financing other revenue administration subprojects in 16 provinces, including&#13;
the provinces' adaptation of the national tax administration's successful system&#13;
for the 2,000 largest taxpayers (Table 2). These tax administration subprojects,&#13;
together with provincial tax policy papers, also financed by PDP-I, provided the&#13;
basis for the modernization of the provincial tax system under the Pacto Fiscal&#13;
of August 1993, which is now being implemented in all but one of the&#13;
provinces.  In addition, PDP-1 financed the development of guidelines for&#13;
provincial financial management reform reflecting recent national legislative&#13;
initiatives. Subprojects to implement these reforms are currently being&#13;
formulated or executed in eight provinces (four under execution). No new&#13;
major physical works have been financed by PDP-I, since the main emphasis&#13;
has been on rehabilitation and the maintenance of roads, schools, health&#13;
facilities, drainage, and irrigation.&#13;
Lessons from PDP-I and MDP-I&#13;
3.    The implementation of PDP-I and MDP-I in Argentina has yielded many&#13;
valuable lessons of experience.&#13;
4.    The Country Department's Infrastructure Strategy Note (1994) analyzes&#13;
managerial and technical weaknesses of executing agencies for all Bank projects&#13;
with the provinces in developing its portfolio management strategy. These&#13;
weaknesses are reflected in: (a) loan covenant noncompliance, especially those&#13;
related to audit reporting; (b) procurement delays; and consequently, (c)&#13;
disbursement delays.&#13;
5.    With respect to audits, PDP-I has been in full compliance from the&#13;
beginning, principally because one private auditing firm was contracted to audit&#13;
all accounts of the CEU and the PEUs. Procurement delays have recurred more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -                      Annex A&#13;
often in PDP-I than in other projects because of the large number of sub-&#13;
borrowers, as well as the administrative problems encountered by the CEU in&#13;
ensuring acceptable quality of bidding documents and adherence to Bank&#13;
procedures. Lastly, disbursement delays can be attributed generally to the fact&#13;
that under PDP-I insufficient preparatory work was done by the time of&#13;
effectiveness to ensure a sufficient number of subprojects for financing. The&#13;
Bank has also underestimated both the difficulties that the subborrowers&#13;
(provinces in PDP-I) would have in meeting eligibility criteria and the time&#13;
required to take actions that would enable them to be eligible for Bank loans.&#13;
Lessons from Other Bank Municipal Development and Technical Assistance&#13;
Projects&#13;
6.    The proposed project will benefit from the many lessons learned over&#13;
more than a decade of Bank experience with municipal development, both in the&#13;
LAC region and worldwide.  From  the earliest Bank-financed municipal&#13;
development projects,' the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) found that&#13;
strong national government commitment to the principles of financially sound&#13;
municipal development and to ongoing reforms is essential for project success.&#13;
Intensive supervision during project start-up and throughout project&#13;
implementation was also found to increase the likelihood of success.&#13;
7.    From the Parana Market Towns Project (Brazil) (Ln. 2343-BR), the&#13;
OED identified several key factors contributing to project success, including:&#13;
(a)   local government support for the operation;&#13;
(b)   small subprojects of relatively simple design, for which local&#13;
communities themselves had expressed a desire;&#13;
(c)   a competent, motivated team in charge of project management at&#13;
the local level; and&#13;
(d)   risk management by simultaneous initiation of subprojects in a&#13;
number of towns, thus reducing the overall average risk of&#13;
delayed project execution, plus providing additional political&#13;
support.&#13;
8.    The ongoing Municipal Development Projects in Parari and Rio Grande&#13;
do Sul States (Brazil) (Ln. 3100-BR and Ln. 3129-BR, respectively) have shown&#13;
I     Jordan: Cities and Villages Development Bank Project (Ln. 1826-JO), approved in&#13;
1981, and Jordan: Second Cities and Villages Development Bank Project (Ln. 2614-&#13;
JO), approved in 1985.&#13;

- 33 -                        Annex A&#13;
that eligibility criteria (such as the preparation of detailed financial anid&#13;
institutional action plans) for participation in municipal development projects&#13;
should be clear and not excessively rigid. Clear and flexible eligibility criteria&#13;
foster increased participation and, at the same time, prevent delays in project&#13;
start-up and disbursements.&#13;
9.    With regard to Technical Assistance projects, experience indicates that:&#13;
(a) projects should be limited in scope to permit adequate preparation, focused&#13;
implementation, and effective supervision; (b) borrower commitment is essential&#13;
to develop a sense of ownership of project activities in affected institutions to&#13;
foster effective implementation; (c) provision for greater continuity in project&#13;
management is necessary; and (d) terms of reference for consultants and studies&#13;
should be spelled out prior to negotiation.&#13;
The Strategy&#13;
10.   The following are the elements of a strategy that was derived from the&#13;
lessons of experience from PDP-I and MDP-I in Argentina, as well as other&#13;
Bank municipal development and technical assistance projects. This strategy&#13;
would improve the agility of project execution, reduce the Bank's burden of&#13;
supervision, and better manage risks by:&#13;
(a)    Making  the review  of subproject technical proposals and&#13;
procurement documents more cost-effective by:&#13;
(i)    Restricting the range of eligible subprojects to sectors&#13;
with fully defined processing procedures (especially&#13;
eligibility criteria).   Nevertheless, the CEU would be&#13;
able to request the Bank's approval for inclusion of&#13;
subprojects that it considers of high priority for attainment&#13;
of the project's objectives, but for which processing&#13;
procedures have not been fully defined.&#13;
(ii)   Standardizing as much as possible procurement documents&#13;
and procedures, as well as all other procedures.&#13;
(iii)   Raising the thresholds for ex-ante review  as high as&#13;
feasible. Use a systematic review of carefully selected&#13;
samples as a way to monitor the quality of subprojects&#13;
below the thresholds.&#13;
(iv)   Contracting out as much as feasible CEU review functions&#13;
to private finns and other entities, as was successfully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -                          Annex A&#13;
carried out with auditing under PDP-I.3  For example,&#13;
review of the FAIPs, technical proposals for subprojects,&#13;
and procurement documents could be contracted out.&#13;
While it is feasible to delegate the supervision of works&#13;
to consultants paid under Bank loans, it would be crucial&#13;
that Bank staff focus closely on Technical Assistance&#13;
components in support of the project's development&#13;
objectives.&#13;
(v)    increasing  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  the&#13;
procurement process in the provinces is particularly&#13;
important, since slow and cumbersome procurement&#13;
procedures have many times been major impediments to&#13;
project implementation in the provinces.&#13;
(b)    Contracting by a retainer of unspecified length (e.g., indefinite&#13;
quantity contracts) implementation specialists (charged back to&#13;
the provinces using their services) to assist the PEUs in&#13;
subproject implementation. This would speed the contracting of&#13;
these specialists and would also reduce the Bank's burden of&#13;
reviewing hundreds of individual consultant contracts.&#13;
(c)    Continuing to improve the capacity of the CEU  and PEUs to&#13;
comply with Bank procedures by:&#13;
(i)    Establishing   a   training   program    on   subproject&#13;
identification, evaluation, preparation, and implementation&#13;
for national government and provincial staff.&#13;
(ii)    Reinforcing  subproject  management  "culture"  and&#13;
capacity in the CEU and PEUs. In this type of project,&#13;
project management at the national level consists of&#13;
managing subproject portfolios that are, in turn, being&#13;
managed by the PEUs. Subproject management software&#13;
that shows where subprojects are in the project execution&#13;
cycle compared with where they "should be" is essential.&#13;
3      For several decades, this has been an established practice with Chile's Ministry of&#13;
Public Works where the cost of supervising road works has been financed under the&#13;
Bank's successive road projects. These consultants report to the Ministry and supervise&#13;
all works under the Ministry's jurisdiction. As far as Bank loans are concerned,&#13;
consultants prepare quarterly reports, participate actively in discussions during&#13;
supervision missions, and also draft aide-memoires. The consultant firn is contracted&#13;
for a designated period, with the Ministry renewing contracts with the same firm to&#13;
ensure continuity. Supervision by the Ministry can be supplemented through annual on-&#13;
site inspections by Bank staff.  This practice has contributed significantly to the&#13;
reduction of Bank staff inputs in supervising Chile's highway projects.&#13;

SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, POVERTY, AND&#13;
PRODUCT&#13;
Demographic Profile&#13;
1.            The 23 provinces and the Municipality of Buenos Aires (MCBA)&#13;
(hereafter, the provinces) participating in the project can be stratified in four&#13;
groups as defined by the Federal Investment Council (CFI)':&#13;
Advanced:             Buenos Aires, C6rdoba, Mendoza, Santa Fe, and the&#13;
Municipality of Buenos Aires.&#13;
Intermediate:         Entre Rios, Salta, San Juan, San Luis, and Tucuman.&#13;
Low Density:          Chubut, La Pampa, Neuquen, Rio Negro, and Santa&#13;
Cruz.&#13;
Underdeveloped:    Catamarca, Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, Jujuy, La Rioja,&#13;
Misiones, and Santiago del Estero.&#13;
2.     These groups are defined in terms of population size, economic product,&#13;
and poverty levels as follows:&#13;
Advanced:             High population and per capita Gross Provincial Product&#13;
(GPP).&#13;
Intermediate:         Intermediate population and per capita GPP.&#13;
Low Density:          Small Population and high per capita GPP.  These are&#13;
provinces on the "Resource Frontier," such as Chubut,&#13;
and Neuquen.&#13;
Underdeveloped:2   Low per capita GPP and high poverty.&#13;
3.     Argentina is also one of the Latin American countries where the&#13;
population is more heavily concentrated. The five provinces in the Advanced&#13;
group comprise over 69% of the total population. Alternatively, the six&#13;
provinces in the Low-Density group comprise less than 6% of the total&#13;
population. This uneven population distribution is reflected in the high density&#13;
1      CFI (Consejo Federal de Inversiones) is a rather unique public institution that is&#13;
financed by a percentage of total provincial revenue sharing. Its Board of Governors&#13;
is comprised of all the Governors of all the provinces. Thus, it is national in scope,&#13;
but provincial in focus.&#13;
2      Note that the last category uses slightly different criteria than the others, in that it&#13;
includes all provinces with low per capita product and high relative poverty levels, even&#13;
those with populations of small and intermediate size. One manner of describing this&#13;
process of classification, then, is that the poorest provinces are first grouped into one&#13;
group, and the rest are, in turn, classified by population and per capita product. The&#13;
provinces of the Intermediate Group had populations ranging from 500,000 to 1.1&#13;
million in 1985 and per capita GPP in the middle third of the distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -                         Annex B&#13;
disparities among provinces, ranging from 41 inhabitants per km2 in Buenos&#13;
Aires to 0.7 inhabitants per km2 in Santa Cruz (see Table 1).&#13;
Unsatisfied Basic Needs&#13;
4.    Although the percentage of households with unsatisfied basic needs tends&#13;
to be relatively higher in provinces with smaller populations and lower per&#13;
capita products, such as Formosa (31.8%) and Santiago del Estero (30.6%), the&#13;
concentration in absoiute terms is highest within jurisdictions in the Advanced&#13;
group. For example, of the 1.2 million households with unsatisfied basic needs&#13;
living in Argentina in 1991, nearly 57% lived in provinces in the Advanced&#13;
group, with over 35 % concentrated in Buenos Aires alone. Alternatively, less&#13;
than 23 % of all households with unsatisfied needs lived in provinces within the&#13;
Underdeveloped group.  Thus, efforts to redistribute resources among the&#13;
provinces through revenue sharing can run counter to the objectives of relative&#13;
equity and need distribution, since they tend to distribute away from areas where&#13;
the absolute concentrations of poor households are the highest (see Table 2).&#13;
Gross Provincial Product&#13;
5.    Gross Provincial Product (GPP) is highly concentrated in provinces in&#13;
the Advanced Group, which accounted for over 73% of total GPP in 1989.&#13;
Alternatively, all eight provinces of the Underdeveloped group accounted for&#13;
less than 9% of the total GPP. On the other hand, provinces in the Advanced&#13;
group have experienced the lowest growth rates in GPP over the 1970-89&#13;
period, while those with the fastest growth rates have been on the "resource&#13;
frontier," such as Neuquen, mostly due to the increase in gas and oil&#13;
production. Overall, stagnation set in for most provinces during the 1980s, with&#13;
Buenos Aires being the biggest loser, with the rate of growth in GPP dropping&#13;
to about 0.6% per year between 1970 and 1989 (see Table 3).&#13;
6.    In terms of per capita GPP, the Province of Buenos Aires ranks twelfth,&#13;
with a per capita GPP of US$1,607 in 1991, about half that of the Provinces of&#13;
Santa Cruz, Chubut or Neuquen. The two poorest provinces (Formosa and&#13;
Santiago del Estero) had a per capita GPP of less than US$800 (see Table 4).&#13;

PROVINCIAL FINANCIAL INDICATORS&#13;
1.    Table 1 shows Total Current Revenue, Total Current Expenditures, and&#13;
Current Account Surplus for all provinces for 1991, 1992 and 1993. While 11&#13;
provinces held a Current Account Surplus in 1991, only eight did in 1993. All&#13;
but one province in the Advanced Group had a current account surplus in 1993,&#13;
while none of the provinces in the Underdeveloped group did.&#13;
2.    Based on 1993 provincial executed budgets of all the provinces, the&#13;
following indicators were estimated for each province:&#13;
(a)   Current Account Equilibrium: Estimated as Current Revenues&#13;
(excluding discretionary transfers)/Current Expenditures. Table&#13;
2 shows the percentage of provinces that fall within each range.&#13;
Overall, current revenues exceed current expenditures in over&#13;
one-third of all 24 provinces. However, current expenditures&#13;
exceed current revenues in the remaining 67% of the provinces&#13;
by up to 47%. By this criteria, only 33 % of provinces would be&#13;
eligible for investments in new physical works under the project.&#13;
(b)   Debt Service  (Interest +  Amortization)/Current Revenues&#13;
(excluding discretionary transfers): This indicator shows that&#13;
current debt service does not represent a significant burden for&#13;
the majority of provinces. Only 25% of all provinces pay more&#13;
than 15% of their current revenues to service current debts.&#13;
Thus, 75% of provinces would have sufficient debt capacity to&#13;
participate in the project using this indicator.&#13;
3.    Based on the same provincial financial data described above, the&#13;
following indicators were estimated for each province:&#13;
(a)   Automatic Revenue-Sharing Transfers (coparticipaci6n)lCurrent&#13;
Revenues (excluding discretionary transfers):  This indicator&#13;
reflects the proportion of provincial revenues that are relatively&#13;
predictable for being automatically transferred to the provinces&#13;
based on percentages established by the national coparticipaci6n&#13;
law.  Overall, Table 3 shows the that provinces are heavily&#13;
dependent on their coparticipaci6n transfers, with over 83% of&#13;
provinces receiving over 40% from these sources.&#13;
(b)   Discretionary Transfers (both grants and loans)/Total Revenues&#13;
(excluding discretionary transfers): Alternatively, this indicator&#13;
reflects the dependency of individual provinces on discretionary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -                      Annex C&#13;
funds, which are unpredictable in amount and timing. These&#13;
transfers represent less than 10% of current revenues for 25 % of&#13;
all provinces; other provinces, such as La Rioja, have a&#13;
pervasive dependence on this type of source--up to 58% of&#13;
current resources are discretionary transfers.&#13;
Financial Capacity of the Provinces&#13;
4.    Data on the financial capacity of the provinces suggest that provincial&#13;
counterpart funding does not present a large risk for project implementation.&#13;
In 1993, one-third of all provinces reported current account surpluses, excluding&#13;
discretionary grants, for a total of US$578.2 million (see Table 1). Although,&#13;
of course, not all of this amount should be considered as available for meeting&#13;
the provincial counterpart requirement (US$96 million), it provides an indicator&#13;
of the provinces' capacity to invest and to service debt. The sum of the real&#13;
investments (works and goods) in the provinces with current account surpluses&#13;
was US$1,215 million in 1993, up from US$485 million in the provinces with&#13;
current account surplus  in  1989.   Considering  a  six-year program&#13;
implementation period, the proposed project's financing for real investments&#13;
(US$229.5 million would represent the project's financing for about 3% of the&#13;
total real investment program, assuming that only a third of all provinces were&#13;
eligible for investment financing, and no improvement in current account&#13;
surpluses. Table 5 shows the capital expenditures of the provinces from 1983&#13;
to 1993.&#13;

INITIAL ALLOCATION AND COMMITMENT FEES BY PROVINCE&#13;
Initial Allocations&#13;
1.    Fifty-six percent of the loan proceeds would be allocated initially to&#13;
participating provinces for one year and the remaining 44% would be placed in&#13;
a "pool" of resources. The resource pool would be available on a first-come,&#13;
first-served basis, to any province that had committed all of its initial allocation&#13;
to approved subprojects. The reason for having an initial allocation is to allow&#13;
all provinces a fair chance to use loan proceeds. If there were no initial&#13;
allocations, the more efficient provinces might use all of the resources before&#13;
the less efficient ones could act. Less efficient provinces might not even try to&#13;
compete.&#13;
2.    After the one-year period, all the initially allocated resources not&#13;
committed to approved subprojects would go to the pool and were allocated on&#13;
a first-come-first-served basis. The pool would then reward the provinces that&#13;
are more efficient in subproject execution, introducing an element of&#13;
competition into the allocation of resources among provinces. Provinces have&#13;
to use their initial allocations of loan proceeds by the end of the one-year period&#13;
or compete with other provinces for them once they become part of the pool.&#13;
3.    The initially assigned amount (US$125 million) is allocated among the&#13;
participating provinces based on the secondary distribution coefficients used in&#13;
national/provincial coparticipaci6n,' as shown in Table 1. These coefficients&#13;
are strongly redistributive, favoring the poorer and less populated provinces at&#13;
the expense of the more developed and heavily populated ones. Provinces in the&#13;
Advanced group receive a per capita initial allocation (US$3.05), which is only&#13;
half of that received by provinces in the Underdeveloped group (US$6.20).&#13;
Commitment Fees&#13;
4.    Provinces are expected to pay a 0.25% commitment fee for those funds&#13;
that are initially allocated and have not yet been disbursed (although the&#13;
contractual amount will be 0.75%). Table 1 shows what provinces would pay&#13;
in commitment fees based on the initial loan allocation and assuming that no&#13;
disbursements were made after one year. Initially allocated funds not used by&#13;
a province would be transferred to the general pool after one year. The&#13;
1     The coefficients are estimated based on National Revenue Sharing Distribution (Law&#13;
23548).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                          Annex D&#13;
province that subsequently uses these funds will be respofisible for past&#13;
commitment fees. All provinces would pay commitment fees on the resources&#13;
in the "pool" in accord with the same criteria used in the initial allocation, with&#13;
compensation by those provinces which actually use the resources.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    The economic evaluation of the program was carried out based on the&#13;
rate of return of five physical investment subprojects approved under PDP-I&#13;
which represents over 38% of the total potential demand.'&#13;
2.    The rates of return for these five subprojects are based on at least two&#13;
alternative methods for the evaluation of benefits. In the case of roads, the&#13;
benefits that were taken into account included savings in travel times, costs of&#13;
vehicle operation, and road maintenance. In the case of rehabilitation of health&#13;
care facilities, the benefits included savings in travel costs and waiting times for&#13;
potential patients, as well as other savings from overcrowding in other facilities&#13;
to be relieved by the subproject.&#13;
3.    The overall weighted internal economic rate of return (IERR) shown in&#13;
Table 1 (20.1%) was estimated in three stages as follows:&#13;
(a)    IERR by subproject: Estimated as described above.&#13;
(b)    Weighted EERR by subprojects in the subsector: For each of&#13;
the two subsectors represented in the sample (i.e., provincial&#13;
roads and rehabilitation of health care facilities), the average&#13;
IERR was estimated by weighting the average IERR of each&#13;
subproject by its cost relative to the total cost of all subprojects&#13;
in the subsector. In particular,&#13;
IERP,(,) = E ierr(i) * C(j) / C(s,&#13;
where IERRs,) is the weighted rate of return for each subsector in&#13;
the sample, ierr(i) is the subproject rate of return, c(;) is the cost&#13;
of the subproject, and C(S,) is the sum of the costs of all&#13;
subprojects in the subsector, namely, C(s) = s c(;).&#13;
(c)    Overall IERR weighted by subsectors in the project: Estimated&#13;
by weighing the average IERR of each subsector in the sample&#13;
by the cost of the subsector in the project relative to the total cost&#13;
of the project. In particular,&#13;
1     The potential demand in each sector was estimated based on a preliminary sample of&#13;
18 subprojects to be financed under PDP-11 which accounted for US$144 million.&#13;

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE&#13;
PROJECT OPERATIONS MANUAL&#13;
1.    The CEU has prepared a Project Operations Manual (POM) for the&#13;
provinces that contains sufficient detail to provide guidelines to all provinces on:&#13;
(a) the program's objectives, eligibility criteria and operational procedures; and&#13;
(b) the operational commitments necessary to implement all of the agreements&#13;
to be reached with the national government and the Bank. The POM's coverage&#13;
of the project's objectives, components, eligibility criteria and implementation&#13;
responsibilities would be the same as those detailed in the SAR. With the&#13;
exception of the above, the following are the main elements covered in this&#13;
manual.&#13;
Financial Action and Investment Plan&#13;
2.    The main objective of the FAIP is to show how provincial revenues will&#13;
be raised and expenditures controlled to attain a current account surplus to be&#13;
used for new investments (including costs of operation, maintenance, and debt&#13;
service). The first two parts of the FAIP deal with generating a current account&#13;
surplus, while the third part establishes the criteria for the sound investment of&#13;
this surplus.&#13;
3.    The FAIP would cover both centralized and decentralized administrations&#13;
of provinces and municipalities, as well as their public enterprises. Although&#13;
the entire subnational public sector would eventually be incorporated, initial&#13;
efforts should focus on the General Administration (Central Administration and&#13;
Consolidated Decentralized Entities) of the provincial governments.&#13;
Increasing Provincial Own-Source Revenues&#13;
4.    This section would cover general measures aimed at increasing the&#13;
efficiency in the collection of tax and non-tax revenues, such as improved&#13;
accounting controls and information systems, and computer systems and&#13;
software. Ways of improving human resources for revenue collection should&#13;
also be addressed, mainly through training programs and recruitment from other&#13;
provincial government departments. In some cases, it may be more efficient to&#13;
contract services from the private sector, such as in the case of collection of&#13;
delinquent accounts or for billing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Controlling Expenditures and Increasing Efficiency&#13;
5.    The FAIP would show how public resources and to be allocated with&#13;
greater efficiency. Expenditures on personnel, goods and services, and transfers&#13;
should receive special attention due to their importance in provincial budgets.&#13;
Prioritization and Justification of Investment&#13;
6.    This section would provide all the elements necessary for program&#13;
appraisal. It is expected that the quality of provincial investment planning will&#13;
improve over time. Initially, simple investments, primarily for maintenance&#13;
operations and rehabilitation, are expected to be predominant. As provincial&#13;
capacity to plan and program investments is strengthened through technical&#13;
assistance financed under the program, the quality of investment prioritization&#13;
and justification within and between sectors should be emphasized and enhanced.&#13;
Baseline Projections and Subproject Impacts&#13;
7.    Finally, each FAIP would show baseline projections for revenues and&#13;
expenditures (i.e., projections without the proposed project) as well as&#13;
projections of the impact of the subproject on revenues (e.g., increased tax&#13;
operations).  For example, an irrigation subproject would increase future&#13;
production and, hence tax returns, but also requires expenditures for operation&#13;
and maintenance.&#13;
Debt Capacity&#13;
8.    The FAIP would demonstrate that the province has sufficient debt&#13;
capacity as defined by the program financial performance indicators (i.e.,&#13;
Current Account Funds minus Stock of Debt).&#13;
Appraisal Guidelines&#13;
9.    Table 1 presents a general summary of the elements required for&#13;
appraisal of each type of component, as well as those items that would be&#13;
eligible for Bank financing, including beneficiary participation and poverty&#13;
focus/targeting.&#13;
Technical Quality&#13;
10.   When examining a proposed civil works subproject, the PEU would&#13;
verify that acceptable engineering practices were used in subproject design. The&#13;
general design criteria must be in full conformity with Argentine technical&#13;
norms (normas tecnicas argentinas).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                       Annex F&#13;
Economic Efficiency&#13;
11.   For smaller subprojects costing less than the limits proposed in Table 1,&#13;
it would be acceptable to use the least-cost solution, rather than performing a&#13;
complete cost-benefit analysis. The least-cost solution is the alternative that&#13;
attains the program's objective at the lowest cost. For example, for rural feeder&#13;
roads, a service level--expressed as the minimum number of days that a&#13;
region's farmers would have access to markets using the roads--would be set.&#13;
The alternative that meets that service level at the lowest cost, including&#13;
maintenance and operation, would be selected. The least-cost analysis also&#13;
would include estimates of effective demand (benefits), so that expenditure&#13;
alternatives within sectors may be ranked by priority. In preparing cost-benefit&#13;
analyses, the general Bank guidelines would be used, with specific guidelines&#13;
provided for sectors in which there are Bank operations with specific&#13;
methodologies approved (e.g., water and roads).&#13;
Financial Sustainability&#13;
12.   The PEU would demonstrate in its FAIP that it will be able to fully&#13;
operate and maintain the component.  Cost recovery through user fees,&#13;
betterment levies, and the like should be as complete as possible.&#13;
Institutional Capacity&#13;
13.   The PEU would demonstrate that it has sufficient capacity to implement&#13;
the program proposed in the FAIP (see para. 17, 19, Annex H).&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
14.   This should be based on the guidelines established by the Bank (para.&#13;
2.31). See the environmental analysis requirements for the different categories&#13;
of expenditures (i.e., maintenance, rehabilitation, etc.) in Table 1.&#13;
Legal Analysis&#13;
15.   Where pertinent, each province's FAIP must provide the legal analysis&#13;
and documents necessary for program implementation. This would be especially&#13;
important in the case of proposed completion of unfinished works.&#13;
Procurement Procedures&#13;
16.   The POM would include procurement procedures and standard bidding&#13;
documents fully consistent with Bank guidelines (see Section II, p. 20).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                     Annex F&#13;
17.   Disbursement procedures, and accounting and auditing proeedures would&#13;
be similar to those detailed in the SAR. Subproject monitoring and performance&#13;
indicators are described in Annex G.&#13;

SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
1.    Because of the broad range of potentially eligible subprojects to be&#13;
implemented in many jurisdictions, proper supervision of the proposed&#13;
agreements and conditions to be incorporated in the program's legal documents&#13;
will require carefully planned and executed procedures. In addition to the&#13;
supervision of procurement and audit procedures, key elements of program&#13;
implementation and supervision include subproject appraisal and approval,&#13;
disbursement procedures, and field supervision by Bank missions. These are&#13;
summarized below.&#13;
Subproject Appraisal and Approval&#13;
2.    The specific institutional development and  investment activities&#13;
(subprojects) to be financed under the loan would follow the procedures outlined&#13;
below:&#13;
(a)   Only subprojects included in an approved FAIP would be eligible&#13;
for financing.&#13;
(b)   Once the PEU and CEU have received all information for a&#13;
satisfactory appraisal (including technical, economic, financial,&#13;
and environmental aspects, as described in the POM) for a&#13;
specific subproject, the CEU would propose its approval to the&#13;
Bank. The informnation provided by the CEU to the Bank would&#13;
be determined by the type of subproject and its estimated cost.&#13;
(c)   As a general rule, such information will consist of a summary&#13;
description of the objectives and content of the subproject, the&#13;
expected benefits (including rate of return when required by the&#13;
POM) to be derived from it, the kind and amount of inputs to be&#13;
financed out of the subloan and with counterpart funds, the&#13;
procurement procedures to be applied, as specified in the POM,&#13;
proposed direct or indirect recovery of the costs of the&#13;
subproject, and such other additional information as the Bank&#13;
may reasonably request.&#13;
(d)   All FAIPs would be reviewed in detail by the CEU and by the&#13;
Bank prior to their approval by each institution. In the cases of&#13;
eligible subprojects, these would be reviewed ex-ante by each&#13;
institution on a sample basis, as summarized in Table 1. When&#13;
supervision requires prior review by the Bank, a full set of&#13;
documents, including all information required by the POM,&#13;
would be furnished to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                                      Annex G&#13;
(e)    In all cases the CEU would assign a code and number to each&#13;
subproject, which would be used in all correspondence and&#13;
procedures relating to such subproject.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                     Annex G&#13;
Sunmary Disbursement Procedures&#13;
3.    Once the Bank has approved financing for a subproject, it will give&#13;
notice to the CEU through a telex, facsimile, or aide-memoire, indicating the&#13;
subproject's code and number and the amount eligible for financing under the&#13;
subloan for such subproject.&#13;
4.    The CEU would keep accurate records of the procurement procedures&#13;
followed and the amounts disbursed under each subproject. The procurement&#13;
procedures and disbursement requests would conform to the requirements set&#13;
forth or referred to in the Loan Agreement and the POM.&#13;
5.    Disbursements from  the Loan Account would be made only for&#13;
subprojects approved by the CEU and the Bank. The evidence to be furnished&#13;
to the Bank regarding each disbursement would be determined by the type and&#13;
amount of the expenditures. Shortly after negotiations, the Bank would send to&#13;
the CEU a letter describing such procedures, including the limits to and&#13;
requirements for Statement of Expenditures (SOEs), letters of credit, and direct&#13;
payments to foreign suppliers and contractors.&#13;
Bank Supervision&#13;
6.    In addition to desk reviews to be undertaken at Bank Headquarters and/or&#13;
at the Bank's Resident Mission, the Bank would field at least two supervision&#13;
missions per year. The objectives of these missions would be to:&#13;
(a)   Monitor compliance of the CEU with all agreed procedures; and&#13;
(b)   Visit about two provinces per mission to monitor the PEUs&#13;
compliance with all agreed procedures, as well as to analyze and&#13;
evaluate the implementation of a number of subprojects financed&#13;
under the loan.&#13;
7.    The Summary Supervision Plan is presented in Table 2.&#13;

b/     Additional missions would follow the same pattern until six months before project&#13;
completion, at which time an Implementation Completion Report mission would be&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
Performance and Monitoring Indicators&#13;
8.     Throughout project implementation, indicators will be used: (a) to&#13;
monitor on-going project activities (for Bank reporting purposes), and (b) to&#13;
evaluate performance of all provinces, tracking progress towards project&#13;
objectives (incorporating cross-province comparisons). Both types of indicators&#13;
will be incorporated in the semestral progress report from the CEU to the Bank:&#13;
(a)    Monitoring.  Project monitoring indicators (see Table 3A) will&#13;
allow tracking of project progress in each province.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -                         Annex G&#13;
(b)    Performance indicators. Use of standard performance indicators,&#13;
in addition to facilitating assessment of the project impact, will&#13;
improve information accessibility and flow to policy-makers at&#13;
both  the  national and  provincial levels.    Collection  of&#13;
performance indicators is thus integral to the institutional&#13;
development aspects of the project. Based on experiences in the&#13;
first Provincial Development Project, the monitoring indicators&#13;
have been refined to differentiate between actively and nominally&#13;
participating projects.&#13;
9.    Table 3B reflects performance indicators that will be used for this&#13;
purpose.  Indicator definitions and reporting formats will be discussed at&#13;
negotiations. Information noted in Table 3B will be collected for each province.&#13;
Data will be ranked by an indicator of participation (e.g., project participation&#13;
indicators from Table 3A).&#13;

established by the Project Operations Manual (POM). In addition, the Executive&#13;
Coordinator would provide administrative and technical support to other Bank-&#13;
funded activities that fall under the jurisdiction of SAREP.  To facilitate&#13;
effective performance in the execution of the program, the Executive&#13;
Coordinator would continue to be advised by a staff of sectoral specialists, as&#13;
was done in PDP-I. These specialists would appraise the documents in their&#13;
areas of expertise and advise the different divisions of the CEU accordingly.&#13;

*     Prepare the POM, with the assistance of the Investment Program&#13;
Division; once agreed upon by the Bank, this manual could not&#13;
be amended without its prior consent.&#13;
*     Verify the annual current account surplus of the provinces.&#13;
Sk    Evaluate the PEUs annually, including their general performance,&#13;
staffing and working conditions.&#13;

criteria.&#13;
wReceive, appraise and monitor the implementation of the&#13;
Financial Action and Investment Plans (FAIP) of the provinces.&#13;
*     Implement the institutional development component of the&#13;
program by assessing the needs for technical assistance for itself&#13;
and for the provinces and by doing the necessary feasibility&#13;
studies.&#13;
*     Participate in the supervision of program implementation.&#13;
*     Assist the Administrative Division in the preparation of program&#13;
implementation reports.&#13;
4.    The Investment Program Division would continue to:&#13;
*     Assist the Institutional Program Division in the preparation of the&#13;
program implementation manuals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                      Annex H&#13;
*     Appraise annually a sample of civil works subprojects presented&#13;
by the provinces in accordance with criteria acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
*     Supervise the procurement procedures of the provinces.&#13;
*     Assist the Institutional Development Program Division in the&#13;
assessment of the need for technical assistance and training in the&#13;
provinces for the implementation of civil works, improving the&#13;
design of budgeting procedures, and maintenance plans.&#13;
*     Participate in the supervision of program implementation.&#13;
*     Assist the Administrative Division in the preparation of program&#13;
implementation reports.&#13;
*     Support PEUs in carrying out environmental screening and&#13;
analysis.&#13;
5.    The Financial Management Information System  Division would&#13;
continue developing the information of the system so as to continue providing&#13;
reliable data at both the national and provincial levels. This system would&#13;
continue providing essential data for macroeconomic planning, as well as for&#13;
monitoring provincial progress towards achieving fiscal autonomy.&#13;
6.    The Contracting Division would be established to ensure that all&#13;
activities supporting contracting for the Project is carried out according to Bank&#13;
guidelines. More specifically, this Division would:&#13;
*     ()Oversee the Provinces' procurement, bidding, and contracting&#13;
activities.&#13;
*     Provide technical assistance to the Provinces.&#13;
*     Review  ex-ante all formal contracting documents (in the&#13;
corresponding cases) prior to Bank review.&#13;
*     Assist the  Executive  Coordinator  in  appraising  finance&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
*     Review  and provide recommendations of exemption to the&#13;
Executive Coordinator in cases authorized by the Bank.&#13;
7.    The Administrative Division, in addition to performing the general&#13;
administrative duties for the CEU, would continue to:&#13;
*     Carry out all Project-related legal agreements, including those&#13;
with the Bank and the provinces.&#13;
*     Receive and consolidate the audits of the provinces and CEU.&#13;
*     Prepare the program implementation reports.&#13;
*     Maintain the special and program accounts.&#13;
*     Provide administrative and technical support to other Bank-&#13;
financed activities that fall under the jurisdiction of SAREP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                      Annex H&#13;
8.    A structure for the CEU should be maintained but fine-tuned to increase&#13;
overall cost-effectiveness, as this CEU has demonstrated its efficiency and is&#13;
composed of a high technical level of human resources as well as equipment.&#13;
Contracting out for those tasks that require specialized consultant studies is&#13;
proposed. For these tasks, the CEU would contract individual consultants or&#13;
consulting firms (depending on the size of each contract) in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines.&#13;
9.    The experience of PDP-I indicates that its staff would be composed of&#13;
approximately 25-30 consultants.  The basic group would be assisted by&#13;
consultants based on need. The core CEU staff would tentatively be comprised&#13;
as follows:&#13;

This includes the senior staff, but not support staff (e.g., Junior Systems&#13;
Analysts, Word Processors, etc.).&#13;
Description of the Divisions of the PEU and Their Staffing Requirements&#13;
12.   The structure of each PEU would vary across provinces. However, all&#13;
are expected to have the same general functions and staffing requirements, as&#13;
summarized below:&#13;
13.   The Institutional Development Program Division would:&#13;
*     Prepare statements of the annual current account situation to be&#13;
presented to the CEU.&#13;
*     Prepare the province's annual FAIP.&#13;
*     Monitor the implementation of the annual FAIP.&#13;
*     Assess the provincial needs for technical assistance and training&#13;
in order to receive CEU support.&#13;
*     Assist the Administrative Division in the preparation of program&#13;
implementation reports.&#13;
14.   The Investment Program Division would:&#13;
*     Discuss with the provincial executing agencies (ministries or&#13;
other entities responsible for the execution of civil works) all&#13;
procedures for procurement, disbursement, monitoring and&#13;
supervision that are included in the POM.&#13;
*     Appraise the subproject for civil works presented by the&#13;
executing agencies.&#13;
*     Review ex-ante all procurement procedures of the executing&#13;
agencies.&#13;
*     Support the Institutional Development Program  Division in&#13;
assessing technical assistance and training needs of the province&#13;
for the implementation of civil works (procurement and&#13;
supervision, improving subproject design and budgeting&#13;
procedures, and the development of maintenance plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -                      Annex H&#13;
*     Supervise civil works implementation.&#13;
*     Supervise implementation of the maintenance plans.&#13;
*     Verify  the certified  receipts of contractors to  authorize&#13;
disbursement by PEU, according to the procedures established in&#13;
the POM.&#13;
*     Assist the Administrative Division in the preparation of Program&#13;
Implementation Reports.&#13;
*     Screen investments for environmental impact and ensure that an&#13;
adequate environmental analysis is carried out when required.&#13;
15.   The Financial Management Information System Division would:&#13;
*     Develop an information system that is compatible with that of the&#13;
CEU for the province which will eventually include centralized&#13;
and decentralized entities of both the provinces and&#13;
municipalities. This system will provide essential data for&#13;
economic planning as well as for monitoring provincial progress&#13;
toward the goal of fiscal autonomy.&#13;
16.   Besides performing  the normal PEU  administrative duties, the&#13;
Administrative Division would:&#13;
*     Maintain the program account.&#13;
*     Maintain all documents necessary for the semi-annual audits.&#13;
*     Prepare an overall program  report to be sent to CEU&#13;
semiannually.&#13;
17.   There are two basic conditions necessary for the PEU adequately to&#13;
assume its implementation responsibilities under the program: (a) sufficient&#13;
authority, and (b) adequate staffing:&#13;
(a) Sufficient Authority: Given that the program represents a first step&#13;
in a strategy for the reform of the public sector, the PEU needs the authority to&#13;
coordinate the process. This authority ultimately flows from the governor and&#13;
from his commitment to support the needed reforms. Without this clear&#13;
commitrnent and support, the program will not be successfully implemented.&#13;
(b) Adequate Staffing:  The staff must have sufficient technical&#13;
expertise to carry out implementation and the competence to interact with&#13;
specialized agencies. The PEU should not be a large entity. Rather than&#13;
duplicating the functions and tasks of existing agencies, the PEU should seek to&#13;
coordinate their activities to attain the program  objectives.  In addition to&#13;
performing directly all planning and programming, the PEU would participate&#13;
in the implementation of specific program components, perform supervision and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-81 -                       Annex H&#13;
reporting duties, and assure the successful coordination of all provincial entities&#13;
involved. The PEU would have appropriate physical space and equipment to&#13;
permit its staff to work cooperatively. Mobility is also very important, so the&#13;
PEUs should not depend on other provincial entities for transportation.&#13;
18.   The experience of PDP-1 indicates that the PEU's staff varies in each&#13;
province. This explains in part why some provinces have been more successful&#13;
than others in the execution of their respective subprojects.&#13;
19.   In PDP-II, a typical PEU would be organized as follows:&#13;
*General Coordinator&#13;
*Executive Coordinator&#13;
*Institutional Development Program Division&#13;
Economist&#13;
Public Finance Specialist&#13;
Financial Analyst&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training Expert&#13;
Government Component of the Program&#13;
* Investment Program Division&#13;
Engineer&#13;
Economist&#13;
Financial Analyst&#13;
Environmental Specialist&#13;
*Financial Management Information Systems Division&#13;
Public Finance Analyst&#13;
Computer System Specialist&#13;
Junior Analysts&#13;
*Administration Division&#13;
Lawyer&#13;
Accountant&#13;
*General Services&#13;
*TOTAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                      Annex H&#13;
However, the exact number and distribution of the staff would depend on the&#13;
needs of the individual province (paras. 2.27, 2.31)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                      Annex I&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT SUBPROJECTS TO BE CARRIED&#13;
OUT BY THE CENTRAL EXECUTING UNIT (CEU)&#13;
Improvement of the Provincial Financial Management Information System&#13;
(PFMIS)&#13;
I.    Substantial progress was made under PDP-I in the implementation of the&#13;
PFMIS that provides data essential to macroeconomic planning, as well as&#13;
monitoring of progress on provincial fiscal reform. However, the recent rise&#13;
in potential borrowing capacity due to stabilization and the establishment of a&#13;
floor for the amount of the monthly national transfer to the provinces under&#13;
revenue sharing has dramatically increased the importance and urgency of&#13;
improved information on the stock of provincial debt. The data on the debt of&#13;
provincial governments must be improved to provide detailed information on all&#13;
of the sources of short- and longer-term financing, as well as guarantees. Both&#13;
the direct and indirect administrations must be covered. There should also be&#13;
up-to-date information on the extent to which resources from revenue sharing&#13;
have been used as guarantees for loans.&#13;
Training in Subproject Identification, Evaluation, Preparation, and&#13;
Implementation&#13;
2.    This training subcomponent will improve the technical capacity of&#13;
provincial professional personnel in the identification, evaluation, preparation,&#13;
and implementation of subprojects. Improving this technical capacity is critical&#13;
to ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated and investments successfully&#13;
implemented. The training course will be carried out at the regional level in&#13;
cooperation with regional universities that will act as centers of dissemination.&#13;
Training will use real subprojects currently under preparation. This approach&#13;
has the advantage of not only making the training more realistic and relevant,&#13;
but also contributing directly to subproject execution. Special emphasis will be&#13;
on areas shown to need improvement (e.g., developing of subproject execution&#13;
schedules and tracking performance in meeting deadlines, as well as cost&#13;
estimation).&#13;

            Argentina - Second Provincial Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Second
            Provincial Development Project is to continue to provide
            financial support and incentives for provinces to undertake
            their own public sector reform programs consistent with the
            national program. The specific objectives are to: assist the
            provinces in implementing appropriate financial management
            reforms and provide financing for institutional development
            and physical investments that will promote provincial
            economic development. The project will have the following
            components: 1) institutional development including technical
            assistance, training, and equipment to attain the
            project's objectives at both the national and
            provincial government levels; 2) physical investments with
            emphasis on maintenance programs, rehabilitation of existing
            works, and completion of unfinished works, but also
            ecompassing public infrastructure and facilities; and 3)
            project administration for the recurrent costs of project
            implementation at the provincial level.
