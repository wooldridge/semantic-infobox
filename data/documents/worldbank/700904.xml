THE POPULATION OF THAILAND: ITS GROWTH AND WELFARE&#13;
For the last decade Thailand has experienced very rapid fertility&#13;
decline. To what extent is this decline a consequence of the adoption of&#13;
a national family planning program in 1970? Why has the decline differed&#13;
so much by region? Is this a consequence of regional differences in the&#13;
level of development? And what are the demographic and economic consequences&#13;
of these regional differences in fertility decline? These are some of the&#13;
questions addressed in this paper. In addition, the paper contains a general&#13;
overview of trends in mortality and migration as well as fertility.&#13;
While one cannot easily disentangle how much of the fertility decline&#13;
resulted from the government's family planning efforts and how much was&#13;
attributable to development factors such as increased education, urbaniza-&#13;
tion, etc. or to the interaction of the two, one can get some impression&#13;
of the relative importance of overall development factors before and after&#13;
the introduction of the family planning program. Such an analysis is&#13;
contained in this paper. This analysis shows a strong relationship between&#13;
program input and contraceptive use in the post-1970 period even after&#13;
controlling for level of development. For the country as a whole and in&#13;
all regions except the North where saturation seems to have begun, more&#13;
health centers per capita are associated with higher usage levels and&#13;
health facilities and personnel are the most important variables explaining&#13;
usage levels.&#13;
Thus this paper goes beyond the standard description of a country's&#13;
demographic situation and attempts to explain demographic trends in terms&#13;
of socio-economic and policy variables. This analysis indicates that&#13;
increased availability of health facilities can be expected to stimulate&#13;
further reduction in fertility. This seems to be especially true in the&#13;
Northeast which is also the area most likely to suffer a deterioration&#13;
of welfare as a consequence of rapid population growth resulting from&#13;
high fertility complicated by high emigration of working-age adults.&#13;

THE POPULATION OF THAILAND: ITS GROWTH AND WELFARE&#13;
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
1.        Thailand's population is about 44 million (in 1977).  Its growth&#13;
rate is now about 2.5% p.a., a significant reduction from the 3% annual rate&#13;
registered before 1970. The goal of the Government's successful national&#13;
family planning program is a further reduction to 2.1% by 1981 and below 2%&#13;
during the later 1980s. Despite these impressive declines in rates of&#13;
population expansion, the current age structure of the population and&#13;
high fertility will almost inevitably produce a population some 50-80%&#13;
larger by the year 2000. In 1977 the crude birth rate was about 34.5 per&#13;
1,000 while the crude death rate had fallen to about 9 per 1,000 (about the&#13;
same as Europe's). Life expectancy at birth is now about 58 years. The&#13;
welfare of the Thai population as measured by income, health, education or&#13;
social services differs substantially between urban and rural populations&#13;
and among the rural populations of the various regions. The Northeast&#13;
followed by the North appear to rank lowest on most indicators in the 1970&#13;
census. Bangkok and/or the Central Region are consistently the best&#13;
placed, followed by the South.&#13;
2.        For the nation as a whole, mortality has fallen substantially&#13;
since World War II. Since the reduction in deaths from malaria in the late&#13;
1940s, the mortality decline has been fairly gradual. The future course of&#13;
mortality is difficult to determine, since death statistics are not of&#13;
sufficiently good quality to assess differentials in mortality or causes of&#13;
death. There are, however, substantial regional differences in mortality,&#13;
with the South having significantly lower and the North significantly higher&#13;
than average mortality. Higher incomes per capita and the number of first&#13;
class health centers per capita are associated with significantly lower&#13;
mortality. Data on infant mortality appear to be of even poorer quality&#13;
than data on the crude death rate. This is particularly unfortunate since&#13;
not only is infant mortality an excellent measure of health, but it is also&#13;
believed to be an important factor in explaining fertility differentials.&#13;
This scarcity of data on mortality makes it difficult to determine how fast&#13;
mortality will fall, particularly at the regional level, or to determine how&#13;
to accelerate the mortality decline and eliminate regional differentials.&#13;
3.        Fertility data are unreliable prior to 1960, but since then two&#13;
censuses and several sample surveys have shown that fertility has entered a&#13;
period of persistent decline. While the survey results differ, it appears&#13;
that between 1960 and the mid-1970s there has been a decline of between&#13;
26.8% and 22.2% in the total fertility rate. The exact causes of the&#13;
decline are unclear, but the introduction of the Government's family planning&#13;
program in the late 1960s apparently accelerated the decline substantially&#13;
from 8% between 1960 and 1968 to 15% between 1969 and 1975. Analysis of the&#13;
fertility decline shows that regional differences are dramatic, with the&#13;
North, Center and Bangkok area having contraceptive usage rates two and a&#13;
half times those in the South. The Northeast is in an intermediate position.&#13;
In multivariate analysis holding other factors constant, the Northeast had&#13;
higher, new acceptance rates than the Central Region in 1975 and 1976. This&#13;
seems to be due to the earlier saturation in the Center and accelerating new&#13;
acceptance in the Northeast. There are also dramatic regional differences&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
in desired family size, with the Northeast and South having family size&#13;
goals of about 0.7 children greater than the other areas.&#13;
4.        For the country as a whole, the availability of family planning, as&#13;
measured by the number and kind of health facilities per capita and the number&#13;
of physicians per capita, was the most important factor other than region&#13;
explaining contraceptive acceptance. Within regions, contraceptive acceptance&#13;
in the North is approaching saturation and health facilities per se do not&#13;
increase acceptance there, though a greater number of physicians per capita&#13;
would still have a significant positive impact. In other areas, health&#13;
centers and particularly second class health centers appear to have a very&#13;
positive impact on acceptance. The effect appears to be largest in the&#13;
Northeast. In multivariate analysis, social factors are also related to&#13;
acceptance, e.g. literacy in the Northeast, farmland per capita, and the&#13;
percentage of Moslems in the non-Bangkok portion of the Central Region.&#13;
Despite the fact that contraception is generally less acceptable in the South,&#13;
even there health services appear to increase usage. Thus, natural increase&#13;
seems to be fairly responsive to the provision of public health care and&#13;
family planning.&#13;
5.        With respect to migration, the Thai population is fairly stable.&#13;
Since restrictive legislation was enacted in the late 1940s, international&#13;
migration has been fairly insignificant in determining population growth.&#13;
However, internal migration is extremely important in determining the&#13;
regional distribution of population. Between 1965 and 1970, only 6% of the&#13;
population moved across changwat boundaries; this represented a substantial&#13;
increase from the 1955-60 migration rate, and demographic theory suggests&#13;
that as economic development accelerates, migration will increase substan-&#13;
tially. Multivariate analysis shows that emigration is better explained by&#13;
socioeconomic factors than is immigration and that land availability and&#13;
distance to Bangkok have the strongest relationship with emigration. Since&#13;
land availability is also quite important in explaining immigration, this&#13;
illustrates the significant effect of agricultural conditions on internal&#13;
migration. Migration appears to be quite sensitive to economic circumstances&#13;
(e.g., the relationship between per capita income and immigration) in the&#13;
changwats, but whether it is a stabilizing or destabilizing force with&#13;
respect to regional difference in welfare is unclear, since there are&#13;
insufficient data on the characteristics of the migrants. One study,&#13;
however, shows that the education of migrants is higher than the average in&#13;
their home areas but lower than the average in their destination; this&#13;
highlights changwat differences in educational attainment and suggests that&#13;
migration may be a destabilizing force.&#13;
6.        Several projections of Thai population through 2000 have been&#13;
undertaken by the NESDB's Working Group on Population Projections. The Thai&#13;
Government has accepted the projection based on rapid fertility decline, which&#13;
gives a population of 52 million in 1985. The mission estimates that this may&#13;
be too optimistic and thinks that Dpopulation growth will fall between NESDB's&#13;
medium and low projections, i.e. giving a population of 52-54 million in 1985.&#13;
The mission therefore prepared a second set of regional population projections&#13;
assuming a more moderate fertility decline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
7.        The implications of these projections for regional differentials in&#13;
welfare are analyzed briefly. Past population growth and expected future&#13;
trends will cause welfare services in the Northeast to deteriorate further&#13;
relative to the rest of Thailand unless disproportionately large amounts of&#13;
public resources are allocated to the Northeast. Slowing population growth&#13;
would help the situation in the Northeast, but it is already too late to avoid&#13;
the consequences of previous high growth rates. The situation in the North is&#13;
quite different, with the earlier and more rapid fertility reduction resillting&#13;
in conditions much more favorable to economic growth. The South is relatively&#13;
well off but should expect difficulties as a result of rapid population growth;&#13;
however, the current surplus of suitable agricultural land can alleviate&#13;
the South's problems to some extent.&#13;
8.        Analysis of the determinants of migration and fertility indicate&#13;
that they may well operate to offset regional differentials in welfare.&#13;
Fertility declines, particularly prior to 1970, were greater in areas that&#13;
had lower levels of farmland per capita, and thus the Northeast may show a&#13;
greater fertility decline than projected. Migrants tend to be better educated&#13;
and in the prime age groups; they leave areas of low farmland per capita and&#13;
move towards areas with more land and higher incomes, which improves their&#13;
individual welfare but worsens the situation in their original location.&#13;
Policy Conclusions&#13;
9.        Since reduction of inequality is an explicit objective of the Fourth&#13;
Five-Year Plan, the differentials in welfare are of interest per se. The&#13;
differentials in urbanization and population growth are of interest in explain-&#13;
ing current variations in welfare and future prospects at the national and&#13;
regional levels. Eliminating regional and urban-rural differentials in&#13;
welfare would require raising levels of income in poorer regions as well as&#13;
reducing intraregional inequalities. in addition, since good health is one of&#13;
the most fundamental components of welfare, differentials in health facilities&#13;
and personnel need to be eliminated rapidly. The number of people per health&#13;
center is much higher in the Northeast and North than elsewhere, which is&#13;
reflected in substantial differences in life expectancy, particularly in the&#13;
North.&#13;
10.       Closely related to health problems is the lack of potable water&#13;
in many rural areas, which is reflected in a high incidence of water-borne&#13;
diseases. As the population becomes more densely settled, this problem will&#13;
become even more acute, so the objective of increasing potable water supply to&#13;
cover 25% of the population should be given highest priority. However,&#13;
greater emphasis on rural water supply is needed than appears in the plan,&#13;
given the distribution of population between urban and rural areas.&#13;
11.       The difference in access to upper primary and secondary education&#13;
between urban and rural areas and various regions is also substantial. A&#13;
major objective is to make six y'ears of primary education universally available&#13;
by expanding upper primary places. The Northeast needs a disproportionately&#13;
large share of educational resources, given its low levels of educational&#13;
resources beyond the lower primary level and its rapid rate of population&#13;
growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
12.       A major problem in the provision of health and education to the&#13;
poorest rural areas is that of attracting well-qualified personnel. Improved&#13;
incentive systems and tied scholarships could be useful in solving this prob-&#13;
lem.  However, it is quite difficult to compensate for the vast differences&#13;
in welfare between urban and rural areas, and while much discussion and&#13;
experimentation seems to be under way in this area, it received little&#13;
attention in the plan.&#13;
13.       Regional differentials in social and economic circumstances appear&#13;
to have generated regional differentials in population growth. Rates of&#13;
natural increase and immigration differ substantially by region, partly because&#13;
of differences in income level, and the availability of farmland and health&#13;
facilities. Although migration seems to be quite responsive to economic&#13;
opportunities, there appear to be no shortcut policies for altering the flow&#13;
of migrants. Population growth differentials are reflected not only in&#13;
different migration rates, but also differences in fertility. There is&#13;
evidence that in the 1970s, Thailand's population was quite responsive to&#13;
increased access to family planning, which could provide a means of manipu-&#13;
lating population growth that is less expensive than projects designed to&#13;
restructure economic opportunities.&#13;
14.       The family planning program has an excellent record to date, but&#13;
continued expansion of acceptors may not be rapid enough to continue the&#13;
fertility decline. In all areas, the expanded provision of family planning&#13;
services will apparently result in increased usage by those who want no more&#13;
children and are not currently using contraceptives. This source of potential&#13;
acceptors is limited in the North, Center and Bangkok, which have fairly high&#13;
current usage levels; it may also be limited in the South by cultural factors.&#13;
Thus, the Northeast appears to be the most promising area for new acceptors&#13;
from simple expansion of services.&#13;
15.       The plan recognizes not only the importance of offering services,&#13;
but also increasing motivation. The importance of demand creation has been&#13;
demonstrated by the Commmunity Based Family Planning Program, which places&#13;
more emphasis on motivation than the government program and has achieved&#13;
greater pregnancy reduction in all regions except the South. Some motivational&#13;
programs are needed to reduce desired family size and others to encourage&#13;
usage of contraception by nonusers who have already achieved this desired&#13;
size. The latter might be most useffil in the Northeast where family size is&#13;
large on the average and there is no apparent cultural resistance to family&#13;
planning. In the South, cultural resistance to family planning may explain&#13;
the low usage rates among those who do not want more children despite better&#13;
availability of health facilities than elsewhere. However, even in the&#13;
South, acceptance rates are significantly higher in those changwats with&#13;
more second class health centers per capita. These factors indicate the&#13;
role of motivation in raising usage rates and the need for different strate-&#13;
gies to increase usage. While the fertility decline has been impressive, it&#13;
has just begun in the Northeast and has not yet started in the South. These&#13;
areas both need special emphasis, but different strategies; for while the&#13;
Northeast will probably respond quite well to existing service and motiva-&#13;
tional programs, the South may respond more slowly.&#13;

THE POPULATION OF THAILAND: ITS GROWTH AND WELFARE&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01      This paper will summarize the current demographic situation in&#13;
Thailand, the welfare of the Thai population and the most likely trend of&#13;
population growth for the rest of this century. All of these discussions&#13;
will focus on the regional as well as the national situation. This double&#13;
focus reflects the Fourth Five-Year Plan's emphasis on reducing regional&#13;
inequalities in welfare. While there is debate on the usefulness of. the&#13;
regions as units on which to focus policy, this paper concludes that the&#13;
regions are sufficiently different from each other that such a focus is&#13;
valid. There are, however, differences within regions as well as an extreme&#13;
urban-rural differential in welfare.&#13;
1.02      There are several limitations regarding the data available.  While&#13;
censuses have been taken since 1911, only those for 1960 and 1970 are of&#13;
acceptable quality. Even for these years the quality of data varies depending&#13;
on the question examined; for example, the data on literacy seem suspect in&#13;
some instances, but this is probably because literacy is self-reported with&#13;
no external check on accuracy. In addition to the censuses, information on&#13;
population also comes from the vital registration system, birth and death&#13;
registration in particular. The system still suffers from substantial&#13;
underregistration; for example, for 1975, the crude death rate from the vital&#13;
registration system was given as 5.9, while a more careful check of deaths in&#13;
the 1974/75 Survey of Population Change showed a crude death rate of 8.9.&#13;
Therefore, much information on births and deaths reported in this study comes&#13;
not from the vital registration system but from a series of excellent sample&#13;
surveys conducted since 1964/65. The only limitation of these surveys is that&#13;
they do not contain samples from all the 71 provinces of Thailand, so that&#13;
very little accurate information is available on birth and death rates at the&#13;
subregional level. In addition, sampling variability and perhaps differences&#13;
in the sample design of the studies have resulted in discrepancies in the&#13;
estimates of population growth even at the national level. Therefore precise&#13;
knowledge of the rate and sources of growth of the Thai population will&#13;
require substantial improvement in the registration system.&#13;
1.03      Despite these limitations, good population data are quite plentiful&#13;
for the country's income level. In addition, the last ten years have shown&#13;
the growth of a highly qualified group of Thai demographers and social&#13;
scientists studying population within the Government and the universities,&#13;
and the recent dramatic decrease in fertility in Thailand has excited the&#13;
interest of a large number of social scientists outside Thailand. Population&#13;
experts inside and outside the country have generated a number of outstanding&#13;
reports on the demographic situation and they have all been exceptionally&#13;
cooperative in providing the mission with information and insights.&#13;

2. THE DEMOGRAPHIC SITUATION&#13;
Population Size, Age Structure and Distribution&#13;
2.01      In 1975, Thailand had an estimated population of 42 million people&#13;
and was thus one of the 20 most populous nations in the world. It has also&#13;
had one of the fastest growing populations. Although population growth&#13;
slowed substantially during World War II, in the 20 years after the war the&#13;
population grew at an exponential rate of 3% (Table 1). But in the mid 1960s&#13;
fertility began to decline and by 1976 the rate of population growth was&#13;
estimated at 2.6%./1&#13;

2.02      The age structure in Thailand is summarized in Table 2.  Approxi-&#13;
mately 45% of the population is under age 15. This, of course, places an&#13;
enormous burden on the families of these children and the state which must&#13;
attempt to provide them with some minimal level of education and other&#13;
/1 A 1974/75 survey showed a crude birth rate of 37 and a crude death rate&#13;
of 8.9. This implies a growth rate of 2.81%. Fertility has- probably&#13;
fallen since 1974/75 and in addition, there is evidence that the 1974/75&#13;
survey overestimated the crude birth rate.&#13;

services. However, the effect of the fertility decline can be seen from a&#13;
more detailed breakdown of the age structure. The proportion of children in&#13;
the youngest age group fell from 18.6% to 17.5% of the population between 1960&#13;
and 1970. These proportional declines were, of course, accompanied by very&#13;
large absolute increases in the number of children. The total number in the&#13;
school age population increased by 44% over the 10 year period. Even under&#13;
the best assumptions, while the proportion of children will decline substan-&#13;
tially, actual numbers will continue to grow until about 1990.&#13;

2.03      The regional and urban/rural distribution of the population is&#13;
quite important because of the great variations in the socioeconomic and&#13;
demographic characteristics of the residents of different areas. There are&#13;
also substantial differentials in income, educational attainment and health.&#13;
Culture also varies between the regions with four changwats in the South&#13;
having large Moslem populations. The vast majority of the rest of the&#13;
country is Buddhist, but even among the Buddhist populations cultural differ-&#13;
ences exist between the regions.&#13;
2.04      The distribution of the Thai population among the four principal&#13;
regions and between urban and rural areas within those regions is shown in&#13;
Table 3./l   The population of Thailand is predominantly rural:  86.8%&#13;
/1 Urban population is generally defined in Thailand as "living in municipal&#13;
areas." See the background working paper on the urban sector for a&#13;
discussion of this definition.&#13;

of the population in 1970. Despite the rapid growth of Bangkok between 1960&#13;
and 1970 at an annual rate of 6%, the percentage of the population in urban&#13;
areas increased from only 12.5% to 13.2% in this period. This apparent&#13;
paradox results from the fact that: (a) Bangkok is a truly preeminent city&#13;
with a population of about 4 million while the next largest city, Chiang Mai&#13;
in the North, has about 100,000 people; (b) the vast majority of the people&#13;
are rural. Thus, it takes only a small percentage movement of rural population&#13;
from one area to create a staggerinig growth rate for the nearest urban center.&#13;

2.05      Rates of Growth.  The growth of the Thai population since 1911 was&#13;
shown in Table ]. Growth accelerated from 1911 to 1937, then slowed substan-&#13;
tially during World War II. After the war, growth accelerated to the excep-&#13;
tionally high rate of 3.2% during the 1950s. During the 1960s growth began to&#13;
slow as fertility began to fall. This fall accelerated in the early 1970s and&#13;
population growth is now at about 2.5% or 2.6% p.a./l&#13;
2.06      The historical growth of population in the different regions of&#13;
Thailand has been calculated from past censuses by Sternstein. The regions&#13;
he uses (see Figure 1) differ somewhat from those normally used./2 Table 4&#13;
gives estimates of the population size of his regions as well as population&#13;
density. Table 5 gives the approximate regional growth rates calculated from&#13;
various sources.&#13;
/1  The Government estimates growth at 2.5%:  the USAID office of Population&#13;
uses 2.2% and says it may be as low as 1.8%.&#13;
/2  Sternstein's Eastern Plateau corresponds quite closely with the Northeast&#13;
and his Northern Ranges with the North. His Outer Central Plain contains&#13;
several Northern and £entral changwats. Southern Uplands covers provinces&#13;
usually included in the Central Region. The South is contained in his&#13;
regions of South Ranges and Southern Coastal Plains.&#13;

2.07      The regional patterns show that before 1950, the North grew the&#13;
slowest while the Northeast grew at or above the average for the country as a&#13;
whole. The South showed fairly wide fluctuations in growth rates. The&#13;
Central Region as a whole had average or above average growth until 1960, but&#13;
there were fairly substantial differences in growth within the region.&#13;
Despite differences in growth rates, the regional distribution of population&#13;
changed very little over the period 1920 to 1960 as shown in Table 4. However,&#13;
the problems of adjusting to population growth depend not only on the rate of&#13;
growth but whether that growth results from natural increase or migration,&#13;
since the two sources have quite a different effect on age structure.&#13;
2.08      Sources of Growth.  For the country as a whole, natural increase&#13;
has followed a pattern quite similar to overall growth. Table 6 shows&#13;
estimates of natural increase by decades. Comparisons with Table 1 for&#13;
similar, but not identicai periods, show that only in the 1930s did population&#13;
growth substantially exceed natural increase. This was a period of heavy&#13;
immigration. Since 1937 the ratio of natural increase to net migration has&#13;
been greater than 10:1.&#13;

2.09      For the country as a whole, the role of emigration is difficult&#13;
to assess. What evidence exists on immigration suggests that natural increase&#13;
has been the predominant factor in population growth since 1937./I The role&#13;
of immigration can be determined by looking at place of birth of the popula-&#13;
tion: in 1960 only 1.9% of the population were foreign born; in 1970 this&#13;
had decreased to 1%. Only in recent years has the inflow of refugees from&#13;
other Southeast Asian countries threatened to disturb this pattern./2&#13;
Although natural increase has been the dominant source of growth for the&#13;
whole country, this is not true for the regions which differ substantially&#13;
in their rates and sources of growth.&#13;
2.10      For Thailand as a whole variations in natural increase between the&#13;
1920s and the 1960s resulted from a downward trend in mortality and fluctua-&#13;
tions in fertility. During this period, changes in mortality were the major&#13;
factor contributing to the changes in the rate of natural increase, since&#13;
birth rates fell by only 16% while death rates fell by 62%. However, the&#13;
decline in growth in the 1940s and the increase in the 1950s were due in&#13;
part to fluctuations in fertility. These trends are discussed below in&#13;
greater detail.&#13;
2.11      The sources of growth in the various regions prior to 1960 are hard&#13;
to disentangle since vital registration data do not permit the calculation&#13;
of regional differences in the rate of natural increase, nor do censuses permit&#13;
estimation of migration for earlier periods. Starting with the census of 1960&#13;
some data on migration became available covering the 1955-60 period. The&#13;
censuses of 1960 and 1970 and various surveys provide estimates of rates of&#13;
natural increase by region for the period since 1965. Thus, the causes of&#13;
population growth at a regional level can only be examined for the last 20&#13;
years or so.&#13;
/1 In 1949, a law was passed severely restricting immigration.&#13;
/2 Concern over this possibility is explicitly stated in the Fourth Five-Year&#13;
Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
2.12      Table 7 shows the available data on natural increase and migration&#13;
in the 1955-75 period. Over the decade, rates of natural increase by region&#13;
began to diverge substantially from the fairly uniform rate of 3% in 1964/65.&#13;
This was primarily due to differential trends in crude birth rates (discussed&#13;
below). Migration rates differed substantially among regions in the 1965-70&#13;
period, but more recent migration estimates are not available. The implications&#13;
of these differential patterns of growth for development need to be established,&#13;
exemplified perhaps by a comparison of the North and the Northeast. The&#13;
problems implied by population growth in the Northeast will be more serious&#13;
than for the North for two reasons. First, the Northeast is growing faster&#13;
than the North. Second, the Northeast is growing very rapidly from natural&#13;
increase (more than twice as fast as the North) and thus has a large proportion&#13;
of the population in dependent ages. In addition, it loses migrants who are&#13;
primarily of working age, while the North is gaining a few migrants of working&#13;
age. The effect of past differences in fertility and migration are reflected&#13;
in the fact that in the North only 43% of the population is under 15, while in&#13;
the Northeast the proportion is 47%. This differential will probably increase&#13;
in the future given current trends.&#13;

2.13      Bangkok and the South also provide a very sharp contrast.  Bangkok&#13;
has extremely high rates of immigration and thus a very large proportion of the&#13;
population is of working age, while the South has a small net emigration. In&#13;
addition, the rate of natural increase is somewhat lower in Bangkok than in&#13;
the South. These factors together result in a difference of 11% in the&#13;
proportion of working age population (61% in Bangkok and 50% in the South).&#13;

2.14      Mortality.  Some estimates of trends in crude death rates in&#13;
Thailand have been reported in a recent ESCAP monograph. These estimates&#13;
differ substantially, ranging between 30.9 per 1,000 and 24 per 1,000 for&#13;
1945, and 18 and 12.6 in 1955. However, they all show a decline of almost 50%&#13;
over this 10-year period. This period was one of rapidly declining mortality,&#13;
due at least in part to the malaria eradication program which began in 1949&#13;
and resulted in malaria mortality falling from 22% of total mortality in 1947&#13;
to 7.7% in 1955.&#13;
2.15      Estimates of the crude death rate between 1920 and 1970 are depicted&#13;
in Figure 2. Since the reduction in malaria in the 1950s, the decline in&#13;
mortality has been much more gradual. A recent ESCAP study estimated a crude&#13;
death rate of 8.8 in 1970 and the 1974/75 Survey of Population Change found a&#13;
rate of 8.9.&#13;
2.16      Crude death rates reflect changes in the age structure as well as&#13;
changes in conditions of mortality. Age-specific mortality rates or life&#13;
expectancy estimates constructed from age-specific rates allow adjustment&#13;
for changes in age structure./l In Table 8, the estimates for the 5 and 10&#13;
year periods are generally based on a set of assumptions about a constant&#13;
(stable) population age structure, while the estimates for 1964/65 and&#13;
1974/75 are based on survey data. The higher life expectancy observed in&#13;
1964/65 than in the adjacent five-year periods could be due to undercounts of&#13;
mortality in the survey or to biases in the other estimates, since the age&#13;
structure has not, in fact, been constant. A newly available estimate of&#13;
life expectancy based on indirect methods gives a 1964/65 overall estimate&#13;
of 56.7, which is more consistent with the 1960-65 and 1965-70 figures than&#13;
with the 1964/65 survey data. The various estimates give not only different&#13;
levels of life expectancy but also differences in the rate of change between&#13;
the mid-1960s and mid-1970s. The Survey of Population Change figures show an&#13;
increase of less than 2 years in the period 1964/65 to 1974/75, while the&#13;
stable estimates show an increase of over 5 years for the period 1960-65 to&#13;
1970-75.&#13;
2.17      Thus, while all evidence indicates that there has been a substan-&#13;
tial reduction in mortality and an increase in life expectancy since 1945,&#13;
the exact magnitude of the change is uncertain. However, by the mid-1970s&#13;
male life expectancy was in the upper 50s and female life expectancy was in&#13;
the low 60s, and the annual rate of increase in the previous 10 years had&#13;
been between 0.2 and 0.5 year.&#13;

2.18      The most dramatic factor contributing to the mortality decline has&#13;
been the reduction of mortality from malaria which dropped from the major&#13;
cause of death in 1947 to seventh in 1970. Dysentery and diarrhea also&#13;
dropped substantially as contributors to mortality from being responsible for&#13;
13.2% of the deaths in 1947 to 2.8% in 1970. Deaths due to heart disease,&#13;
malnutrition and accidents have increased over the period.  However, much of&#13;
the data on cause of death is quite unreliable, which makes it difficult to&#13;
get a good picture of the major health problems of the Thai population or the&#13;
potential specific sources of future mortality declines.&#13;
2.19      Some insight into possible mortality declines can be obtained by&#13;
looking at the differences in mortality between different groups within&#13;
Thailand, i.e. regional differentials and differences between socioeconomic&#13;
groups. The various regions of Thailand have differed in their level of&#13;
mortality and the trend in mortality in recent years. Table 9 summarizes&#13;
available data on regional mortality. The only reliable data come from the&#13;
1964/65 and 1974/75 Survey of Population Change and even these data are open&#13;
to criticism about coverage, particularly for 1964/65. Because of coverage&#13;
problems, particularly in the South, it is difficult to determine how accurately&#13;
the data represent trends over the past decade. It is probably because of&#13;
underreporting of deaths in the South in 1964/65 that mortality appears to&#13;
have risen there between 1964/65 and 1974/75.&#13;

2.20      In 1975, the North appeared to have the highest mortality in terms&#13;
of both crude death rates and infant mortality rates. On both measures the&#13;
Central Region and particularly Bangkok had the lowest mortality. The mortality&#13;
rankings outside the Central Region are rather surprising, particularly the&#13;
low mortality of the Northeast: in the South, income is high and health&#13;
facilities are more abundant than in the Northeast, and the Northeast is also&#13;
poorer and less well provided with health facilities than the North. The&#13;
higher than expected mortality in the South may result from the very low&#13;
proportion of households with piped water and flush toilets, but again the&#13;
Northeast was low on these health variables.&#13;
2.21      To determine the factors associated with differential mortality,&#13;
multiple regression can be used to relate the adjusted crude death rates to&#13;
socioeconomic and health variables in the 70 provinces. Some of these&#13;
results are given in Table 10, but these results should be interpreted with&#13;
some caution given the imperfections of the vital registration system from&#13;
which they are drawn./l Because the collection of statistics was unreliable,&#13;
deaths probably tend to be better registered in the more developed areas, and&#13;
thus registration coverage varies in direction opposite to the level of&#13;
mortality. This tends to make it difficult to detect real differences in&#13;
mortality. In multiple regression analysis, the crude death rate in the&#13;
various changwats is poorly explained by either socioeconomic variables or&#13;
expenditures on health care. When various factors are controlled, the region&#13;
tends to have the most significant relationship for the crude death rate.&#13;
Thus, the Northeast has significantly higher mortality than the Central&#13;
Region when other variables are held constant. If one examines simple&#13;
relationships rather than analyzing several variables together, only gross&#13;
/1 A recent study by the UN estimated that mortality registration was only&#13;
68% complete in 1965-70. While the figures used hete are for 1972 and&#13;
have been adjusted to some extent, systematic biases are still likely.&#13;

product per capita and the number of first class health centers in the&#13;
changwats are significantly correlated with mortality, and each of these&#13;
tends to be i,nversely associated with mortality. Other health facilities,&#13;
health personnel, health expenditures or proportion of households with piped&#13;
water do not appear to be significantly related to mortality, probably as a&#13;
result of data deficiencies. Until improved data are available on mortality&#13;
there can be little analysis of mortality differentials and their causes.&#13;
2.22      More insight into mortality differentials within regions can be&#13;
obtained by examining how various factors are related to mortality levels.&#13;
In simple correlation, in the North income levels seem to be most important.&#13;
In the South, literacy is negatively related to mortality. In the Central&#13;
Region greater urbanization is associated with lower mortality, but health&#13;
expenditures per capita are associated with higher mortality - a probable&#13;
result of registration procedures. In the Northeast, registration procedures&#13;
also probably explain the fact that higher income and more piped water are&#13;
associated with higher mortality. In multiple regression analysis only&#13;
literacy in the South and piped water in the Central Region are significantly&#13;
associated with lower mortality, and in these cases the direction of the&#13;
relationship is as expected.&#13;
2.23      The above analysis is somewhat unsatisfactory not only because of&#13;
the poor quality of the changwat mortality data but also because interchangwat&#13;
analysis of mortality is somewhat limited, since data that summarize the&#13;
experience of the whole changwat may cover up differences in the mortality&#13;
experience of people within the changwat.  For example, the analysis showed&#13;
that the proportion in urban areas was not significantly related to mortality&#13;
in the interchangwat regressions; however, data from the 1974/75 Survey of&#13;
Population Change showed a crude death rate of 6.2 for people in municipal&#13;
areas and 9.3 for those in nonmunicipal areas. This is both statistically&#13;
and demographically significant.&#13;
2.24      Recently, John Knodel and Apichat Chamrathrithirong wrote the first&#13;
paper (utilizing 1970 census data /1) estimating the infant mortality exper-&#13;
iences of different socioeconomic groups. The education of the mother and&#13;
urban residence appear to be associated with the largest differences in&#13;
mortality. (Education probably affects mortality because the more educated&#13;
tend to have higher incomes and also better knowledge of proper health&#13;
practices.) Table 11 summarizes differences in infant mortality and life&#13;
expectancy for the various groups. At each educational level the municipal&#13;
population has higher life expectancy than the nonmunicipal; this difference&#13;
is greatest among the least educated and amounts to 13 years. Every increment&#13;
in the mother's education increases life expectancy regardless of residence,&#13;
but the difference is much more striking in the nonmunicipal areas. This&#13;
urban-rural difference is probably the result of the higher incomes and&#13;
better access to health care in urban areas./2&#13;
/1 Data are not affected by registration procedures.&#13;
/2 Regression analysis shows that "proportion urban" is the most important&#13;
factor explaining health expenditures per capita. Likewise, "percentage&#13;
urban" was the most important variable explaining differences in gross&#13;
provincial product per capita in both 1967 and 1973.&#13;

2.25      These data indicate fairly substantial reductions in mortality&#13;
through better access to health care, improved incomes and better education.&#13;
If the entire country could reach the level of mortality experienced by the&#13;
least educated people in the municipal areas, life expectancy could be&#13;
increased from between six and ten years on the average. However, achieving&#13;
such reductions will not be simple given the large differentials in health&#13;
facilities in urban and rural areas. There is approximately 1 doctor per&#13;
1,621 people in urban areas compared to 1 per 30,863 in rural areas. In&#13;
terms of hospital beds the ratios are 1 per 150 people in urban areas and 1&#13;
per 900 in rural areas. Given that about 86% of the population is rural, the&#13;
number of health personnel and hospital beds needed to achieve equal coverage&#13;
in rural and urban areas is astronomical. Even to achieve the more modest&#13;
goal expressed in the Fourth Plan of one physician per 18,700 in rural areas&#13;
and 1 per 1,639 in urban areas by 1981 would require at least 2,527 new&#13;
doctors during the plan period./I At present, 385 doctors are trained per&#13;
year and the plan proposes to increase this to 500.  If this could be done&#13;
and if all the doctors remained in Thailand, the quantitative goal might&#13;
possibly be achieved. Whether the physicians could be located in rural areas&#13;
is even more problematic: even if these goals were reached, doctors would&#13;
still be 10 times more plentiful in urban than in rural areas (currently they&#13;
are almost 20 times more plentiful in urban areas). To achieve the goal of&#13;
one hospital bed per 117 people in urban areas and one per 617 in rural areas&#13;
would require approximately 28,816 hospital beds. The effect of population&#13;
growth on the achievement of these targets will be discussed at the end of&#13;
this paper.&#13;

and Social Services," June 1977.&#13;

2.26      Even if government goals in health care could be met, there would&#13;
still be substantial differentials in health care between urban and rural&#13;
areas. Thus, in the near future, it is unlikely that life expectancy in rural&#13;
areas will equal that in urban areas. Without more knowledge of the&#13;
relative importance of higher income, more doctors and hospital beds per&#13;
capita, it is difficult to predict the extension in life expectancy given the&#13;
planned improvement in medical care, but dramatic increases are unlikely in&#13;
the near future in view of the allocations to health care in the plan.&#13;
2.27      Mortality could also be substantially reduced in rural areas by&#13;
increased sanitation and piped water. However, the plan appears to be&#13;
overly optimistic in its expectation that increased coverage of piped water&#13;
and sewerage would bring about a 30% reduction in water-borne diseases.&#13;
Increasing water and sanitation coverage from 14% to 25% of the population as&#13;
planned represents a 64% increase in population covered but a reduction of&#13;
only slightly more than 10% in the population not covered, thus giving a&#13;
maximum of 10% reduction in water-borne diseases.&#13;
2.28      Fertility.  The trend in fertility will be the most crucial factor&#13;
determining the course of population change in Thailand/l but is difficult to&#13;
predict, since it depends on individual decisions on family size as well as&#13;
the ability to implement those decisions. An examination of past changes in&#13;
fertility should help in determining whether the fertility decline is con-&#13;
strained by high levels of desired family size or limited availability of&#13;
contraceptives./2&#13;
2.29      Estimates of the crude birth rate show wide fluctuations between&#13;
1920 and 1955. Over this period crude birth rates temporarily fell as low as&#13;
40 in 1945 but were over 50 in 1937. However, they were generally in the&#13;
upper or middle 40s during most of the period. It is difficult to estimate&#13;
trends in fertility based on vital registration (annual) data due to the high&#13;
degree of underregistration. Therefore, estimates of fertility trends must&#13;
rely on the 1960 and 1970 censuses, the Surveys of Population Change, 1964/65&#13;
and 1974/75, the Longitudinal Study 1968/69 and 1971/72, and the Thai World&#13;
Fertility Survey 1975 (locally referred to as the Survey of Fertility in&#13;
Thailand or the SOFT Survey). These data sources allow a fairly detailed&#13;
picture of the fertility trend since 1960 and all indicate a persistent&#13;
decline since the middle or late 1960s. Table 12 illustrates the course of&#13;
this decline as documented from the various sources.&#13;
/1 Since the death rate is already low at 8.9 per 1,000, the most dramatic&#13;
decrease possible to, say, 5 would have a much smaller effect than a&#13;
fairly modest decline in fertility from 37 to 30.&#13;
/2 The Population Sector Report on Thailand concluded that fertility decline&#13;
was constrained by access to contraceptives. An empirical test of that&#13;
hypothesis is discussed in this section.&#13;

2.30      These data give evidence of a fertility decline, but all the data&#13;
are not perfectly consistent since the SOFT estimate for 1970-74 is substan-&#13;
tially lower than the SPC estimate for 1974/75. However, even using the&#13;
higher estimate of 5.17 in 1974/75, fertility in 1975 shows a decline of over&#13;
20% over the 1960 level. This decline accelerated toward the end of the&#13;
period. The decline was only 8% from 1960 to 1968/69 but was 15% between&#13;
1968/69 and 1974/75. The fertility decline has thus increased substantially&#13;
since the Government's family planning program was introduced in 1968.&#13;
2.31      The causes of the fertility decline are somewhat difficult to&#13;
determine. To examine the effect of various factors it is best to consider&#13;
two periods because of the differences in data available and of the institution&#13;
of the family planning program. The period 1960 to 1970 is marked by the two&#13;
censuses and covers the period prior to the large-scale implementation of the&#13;
Government's family planning program.&#13;
2.32      Examination of census data indicates that the proportion of married&#13;
women increased, so that fertility would have risen slightly between 1960 and&#13;
1970 if the fertility of married women had not declined. The decline in the&#13;
fertility of married women combined with a change in the age structure is&#13;
responsible for the declines in the crude birth rate between 1960 and 1970&#13;
prior to the introduction of the Government's family planning program; increasec&#13;
education, urbanization and reduced availability of land are probably the most&#13;
relevant factors contributing to this decline. Female labor participation&#13;
in Thailand is not necessarily associated with lower fertility, and although&#13;
infant mortality may well be an important factor, good data are not available&#13;
to analyze this.  The change in age of marriage in the 1960 to 1970 period&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
is somewhat uncertain but, regardless of direction, was fairly small, and in&#13;
1960 marriage was already fairly late by Asian standards./l&#13;
2.33      To determine factors responsible for the decline in current fertility&#13;
rates between 19t0 and 1970 we would need detailed data by changwat on childr:n&#13;
born in each year to women either in total or by age of women. Unfortunatellv&#13;
there are no such data of good quality due to the poor coverage of the vital&#13;
registration system. As a substitute, the mission used the number of chi7rlen&#13;
ever born to women of various ages in each census period. There are s"veral&#13;
shortcomings in such an approach. Children ever born reflects a whole lifeLime&#13;
of behavior rather than that in the immediately preceding period; this is&#13;
especially true of older women. Thus the difference in the number of ch4'dren&#13;
ever born to women age x in 1960 and other women aged x in 1970 reflects&#13;
differences in their entire reproductive experience rather than only the&#13;
difference between 1960 and 1970. Thus this represents long-term trends&#13;
rather than period rates. For women under 25, the number of children ever&#13;
born does represent much more recent experience and thus gives a better&#13;
short-term measure of fertility. Unfortunately, in analyzing the data for&#13;
younger women, work by Apichat Chamratrithirong has shown that in 1960 there&#13;
was considerable age misreporting. (The Thais have a tendency to report their&#13;
age at next birthday rather than age at last birthday.) In the 1960 census,&#13;
age was that reported by the respondent while in 1970 it was calculated from&#13;
birth date as age at last birthday. Thus the figure for children ever born&#13;
by age in 1960 is too low (ages were too high) compared with 1970. Apichat&#13;
has shown that if one adjusts for age misreporting by half a year, the number&#13;
of children ever born to women under 35 fell between 1960 and 1970, whereas&#13;
without adjustment it appears to have risen. For older women children ever&#13;
born increased whether data are adjusted or not. This indicates that fertility&#13;
apparently fell somewhat in the period, but the decline is small. The increase&#13;
in children among older women between the two census periods reflects the fact&#13;
that at some time prior to 1960 fertility was probably rising, but-such&#13;
increases in fertility are quite common prior to the onset of a fertility&#13;
decline. Table 13 summarizes the data on children ever born by ages for all&#13;
women in 1960 and 1970. In the analysis presented here, however, children&#13;
ever born to married women rather than all women was used. This makes it&#13;
unnecessary to control for changes in the proportion of married women between&#13;
1960 and 1970.&#13;
2.34      If it is assumed that age misreporting is fairly uniform throughout&#13;
the country, then it is possible to use regression analysis to examine the&#13;
factors associated with fertility change in the 70 changwats between 1960 and&#13;
1970. First, however, regional differences in fertility in Thailand need to&#13;
be examined. The fertility declines differed substantially by region, with&#13;
some regions having very dramatic declines and others little decline or even&#13;
an increase.&#13;

[This is a reproduction of Table 8.2 from Chamratrithirong, 19751.&#13;
2.35      Table 14 summarizes the changes in crude birth rates for the various&#13;
regions between 1964/65 and 1974/75. The decline in the North was by far the&#13;
most spectacular, amounting to 39% over the period, while crude birth rates&#13;
actually rose in the Northeast and the South. Table 15 shows the percentage&#13;
change in fertility for age controlled/i and age-specific fertility rates.&#13;
These data show that while the Northeast had the greatest increase in crude&#13;
birth rates, this was largely due to changes in age structure and an increase&#13;
in fertility in the youngest ages. In the South, the fertility increase&#13;
resulted not from changing ages of women, but increases in the fertility of&#13;
women in four of the seven age groups.&#13;
2.36      Examining age-specific fertility rates shows that these declined for&#13;
all women 30 and over except for those 45-49 in the South. For women under&#13;
30, the changes in age-specific fertility differ dramatically by region. The&#13;
North, which had the greatest overall fertility decline, had declines in all&#13;
age groups whereas the South had increases in all age groups under 30. The&#13;
Central Region with the second largest fertility decline showed fertility&#13;
declines in all but the youngest age group. The Northeast had a fertility&#13;
/I TFR and Gross Reproduction Rates (GRR) control for age structure in a&#13;
much more precise way than the General Fertility Rate (GFR). The crude&#13;
birth rate (CBR) does not control at all for age structure.&#13;

decline in only the oldest of the under 30 age groups. Thus, while the recent&#13;
fertility decline has been attributed to declines in fertility in older&#13;
women, it appears that different changes in behavior of the younger women&#13;
are most important in explaining differences in regional fertility changes.&#13;

2.37      To some extent differences in fertility declines in the region&#13;
result from differences in education, income, and land availability. However,&#13;
such factors alone do not explain all the differences in fertility patterns.&#13;
In particular the fertility decline in the North is difficult to explain,&#13;
since as shown earlier the North tends to have the highest infant mortality&#13;
and the lowest adult literacy. Thus both regional and national patterns of&#13;
change in fertility need to be examined. This technique will not provide&#13;
much insight into the magnitude of the effects of the changes (given the bias&#13;
of the 1960 estimates of fertility) but should enable us to establish the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
direction of the effects. We shall first examine the factors associated with&#13;
the number of children ever born in 1960 and 1970 and then the factors&#13;
associated with the change between 1960 and 1970. The various regression&#13;
equations are reported in Tables 16 and 17. Table 16 shows the regression&#13;
equations for children ever born, 1960 and 1970, and the decline between 1960&#13;
and 1970 for the whole Kingdom and by region. Table 17 shows these equations&#13;
by age of women. While the patterns of significant relationships vary by age&#13;
group and region, several findings are fairly persistent, particularly with&#13;
respect to the change in children ever born between 1960 and 1970.&#13;
(a)  The higher the level of literacy in 1960, the more likely fertility&#13;
was to have fallen between 1960 and 1970. This effect is statisti-&#13;
cally significant in the North and for women aged 30 to 39 in the&#13;
Kingdom as a whole./l&#13;
(b)  The more farmland per capita in a changwat in the early 1960s, the&#13;
less likely the number of children ever born was to decrease between&#13;
1960 and 1970. This was statistically significant in the Northeast&#13;
and the South and for women aged 20 through 39.&#13;
(c)  In the Kingdom as a whole, urbanization is associated in a signifi-&#13;
cant manner with fewer children ever born in 1960 and 1970 for women&#13;
in older age groups. But in 1960, for women in younger age groups,&#13;
the proportion urban was positively related to children ever born.&#13;
Urbanization in 1960 is significantly related to a fall in the&#13;
number of children ever born between 1960 and 1970 only in the&#13;
Central Region. (Among women aged 45 to 49 it has an unexpected&#13;
association with a significant increase in fertility, but this&#13;
probably reflects the distant past).&#13;
(d)  The higher the number of children ever born in 1960, the greater the&#13;
fall in children ever born between 1960 and 1970. This was statis-&#13;
tically significant for the Kingdom as a whole and the Northeast.&#13;
2.38      These results indicate that literacy facilitates a decline in&#13;
fertility, and scarcity of farmland also serves to depress fertility. These&#13;
two forces, however, did not bring about a large decline in fertility over&#13;
the period, perhaps because of countervailing pressures tending to increase&#13;
fertility. Alternatively the increasing scarcity of farmland and higher&#13;
literacy could have stimulated a desire for smaller families, but the lack of&#13;
modern contraception prevented the implementation of these desires. This&#13;
might well explain why contraceptive acceptance proceeded so rapidly once the&#13;
government program was introduced.&#13;
/1  It is interesting to note that in 1960 and 1970 literacy has a signifi-&#13;
cant positive relationship with children ever born in many cases. But&#13;
over time, the areas of higher literacy initially are more likely to&#13;
experience a decline. This is a classic case where cross-sectional&#13;
results cannot be used to predict changes over time.&#13;

2.39      The post-1970 period is characterized by markedly different family&#13;
planning availability than the earlier period. Although the Government b^d a&#13;
pilot family planning project as early as 1964 and the Ministry of Public&#13;
Health began providing family planning in 1968, the Government did not&#13;
formally announce support of family planning until 1970. In 1968, there V-ere&#13;
57,300 acceptors recorded and this figure doubled in 1969; it increased by&#13;
83% in 1970 and 80% again in 1971.  Since that time the number of acceptors&#13;
has been increasing but at a much slower rate. Both knowledge and use of&#13;
contraceptives increased substantially over this period in urban and rural&#13;
areas. In 1968/69, only 48% of the rural women and 74% of urban women had&#13;
heard of at least one method of contraception, but by 1975, these percentages&#13;
had increased to 96% and 98.9% respectively. The proportional increase in use&#13;
was even more substantial. In 1968, 14% of married women were using contracep-&#13;
tion (33% urban and 11% rural), but by 1975 the overall figure had reached 37%&#13;
(49% urban and 35% rural). In the post-1970 period, acceptance rates also&#13;
differed by region. The sum of acceptance rates for 1974, 1975 and 1976 was&#13;
.29 for the whole Kingdom, .33 in the North, .31 in the Central Region, .30 in&#13;
the Northeast and .18 in the South.&#13;
2.40      The first five-year plan for the family planning program covered&#13;
the period 1972-76 and by some estimates was responsible for reducing&#13;
the growth rate of the population from 3.0% to 2.5% p.a. During this period&#13;
it: (a) recruited approximately 2.5 million acceptors; and (b) increased&#13;
service delivery points from 270 in 1970 to 5,400 in 1976, as well as training&#13;
a substantial number of paramedical and medical personnel. Table 18 outlines&#13;
the history of the Thai Family Planning Program to the mid 1970s.&#13;
Several important issues raised in&#13;
these reports need to be addressed to understand the contribution of the&#13;
family planning program in the reduction of fertility since 1970 and for&#13;
projecting the fertility decline over the period of the next five-year plan.&#13;
2.41      A basic hypothesis put forward in the sector report is that accep-&#13;
tance of contraceptives had been limited by the availability of supplies and&#13;
service points rather than the demand for or acceptability of contraceptives.&#13;
A related but more difficult issue is whether the demand for contraceptives&#13;
is approaching saturation and consequently whether future targets of new&#13;
acceptors can be met. We shall first attempt to assess whether demand for or&#13;
supply of contraceptives has constrained the post-1970 fertility decline and&#13;
shall later discuss the feasibility of reaching the contraceptive targets set&#13;
forth in the Fourth Five-Year Plan.&#13;
2.42      To resolve the issue of whether supply of or demand for contracep-&#13;
tives was more responsible for the post-1970 reduction in fertility is quite&#13;
difficult for several reasons. Accurate vital statistics are not available&#13;
and no census has been conducted since 1970. Therefore, the current level of&#13;
fertility is uncertain at the national level and unknown at the changwat&#13;
level. Since the actual change in fertility cannot be measured, the best&#13;
alternative is to use data on contraceptive acceptors by changwat as an&#13;
&#13;

approximation of the fertility decline./l Data on number of new acceptors per&#13;
married woman of reproductive age are available for all changwats for 1974&#13;
through 1976./2 Measuring demand and supply factors is also quite difficult.&#13;
Extent of urbanization, education, income and the availability of resources&#13;
such as land have all been hypothesized to affect the demand for children and&#13;
therefore indirectly the demand for contraception./3 The supply of family&#13;
planning services cannot be readily measured since neither the budget nor the&#13;
personnel of the Ministry of Health are separated into family planning and&#13;
other uses. Therefore, the best approximation of contraceptive availability&#13;
by region is the extent of medical personnel and facilities in the area. The&#13;
relationship between contraceptive acceptance, demand factors and the avail-&#13;
ability of health facilities and personnel will be used to test hypotheses of&#13;
the determinants of the fertility decline since 1970.&#13;
2.43      In an analysis of the relationship between regions, demand factors&#13;
(literacy, gross product per capita, farmland per capita, urbanization and&#13;
proportion Moslem) and health factors (per capita number of first and second&#13;
class health centers, midwifery centers, physicians and health expenditures),&#13;
the health factors turn out to be highly significant if one controls for&#13;
region (see Table 19). This supports the hypothesis that the supply of health&#13;
facilities or health personnel is more important than the factors determining&#13;
the demand for children. Of the demand factors, only the proportion Moslem&#13;
and farmland per capita have significant relationships. The proportion Moslem&#13;
reduced the acceptance rate for 1975 and 1976 and in one case in 1975, the&#13;
regression equation should significantly lower acceptance rates in areas of&#13;
high land availability. But farmland appears to have different effects in&#13;
different regions (Table 20). Only in the North does land scarcity seem to&#13;
significantly increase contraceptive acceptance.&#13;
2.44      Within the health facilities categories, the second class health&#13;
centers consistently had a stronger positive relationship with acceptance than&#13;
did first class health centers or midwifery centers. In fact, the relationship&#13;
/1 Such data are imperfect for several reasons. First, the accuracy of&#13;
clinic data is questionable. However, a number of cross-check studies&#13;
have found these very reliable in Thailand. Second, new acceptance does&#13;
not necessarily represent a prevented birth since it may simply substi-&#13;
tute a clinic method for a traditional method. The magnitude of this&#13;
last source of error is difficult to evaluate, but the very large decrease&#13;
in the birth rate in the aggregate, coinciding as it does with increasing&#13;
acceptance at the changwat levels, tends to indicate that new acceptance&#13;
is more than just substitution of clinic for traditional methods.&#13;
/2 The rate of new acceptors depends on the number of women who are already&#13;
using contraception. Since the program began in 1970, by 1974 areas with&#13;
rapid initial acceptance would have already been experiencing some&#13;
decline in acceptance rates due to saturation. This may explain some of&#13;
the paradoxical results.&#13;
/3 For example, urbanization reduces the demand for children and therefore&#13;
ceteris paribus increases the demand for contraceptives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
between first class health centers per capita and acceptance rates is paradox-&#13;
ically negative but not significant./l This is rather surprising since the&#13;
major distinction between first and second class health centers is the presence&#13;
of a doctor, and the number of physicians per capita has a very strong positive&#13;
relationship with acceptance when one controls for residence in Bangkok. For&#13;
the country as a whole excluding Bangkok, the number of nurses and practical&#13;
nurses per capita in 1975 is significantly related to the number of acceptors&#13;
per capita in 1975 and to a lesser extent in 1976. Midwives and other health&#13;
workers were not significantly related to the acceptance rate even in simple&#13;
correlations.&#13;
2.45      Acceptor rates also differ substantially by region even after&#13;
controlling for differences in socioeconomic circumstances and level of&#13;
health facilities. The great difference between regions in the factors&#13;
affecting contraceptive use is shown by the fact that the R2s are generally&#13;
much higher in 1975 for the regions (Table 20) than for the country as a&#13;
whole (Table 19). After controlling for other factors in all years, the&#13;
North had significantly higher acceptance rates than the Central Region. In&#13;
1975 and 1976 this was also true of the Northeast. In 1974 the South had&#13;
significantly lower levels than the Central Region. These regional factors&#13;
that operate in addition to socioeconomic and health factors need to be better&#13;
understood, since high levels of acceptance can only be maintained if rates&#13;
rise in new areas, since, as mentioned above, certain areas may be approaching&#13;
saturation. Table 20 shows that in the North where usage rates are very high,&#13;
the number of first class health centers per capita has a significant negative&#13;
relationship to acceptance rates. This tends to confirm saturation in areas&#13;
of initial rapid acceptance. However, even in the North the number of physi-&#13;
cians per capita has a significant positive relationship to acceptance rates.&#13;
In the Northeast, literacy seems to interact with health facilities to increase&#13;
acceptance.&#13;
2.46      The related problem of the saturation of demand is the other issue&#13;
that needs to be addressed, first through data on acceptors and then by&#13;
examining the sources of future acceptors. The figures on the number of&#13;
acceptors shows a steady increase since 1973 and the rate of increase has not&#13;
slowed over this period. However, figures on the new acceptor rates per married&#13;
woman of reproductive age have declined from 1974-77, with increases in only&#13;
7 changwats. Acceptors over this period totalled 2,381,100, substantially&#13;
more than the number of women who entered the reproductive ages, i.e. 867,000,&#13;
of which 313,000 were in the 30 to 45 age group (the major candidates for&#13;
acceptance). Thus, the issue of saturation requires specification. Since&#13;
/1 This is possibly because the more developed areas have first class health&#13;
centers and also had rapid initial acceptance rates, and they may have&#13;
already been approaching saturation in 1975.&#13;

population growth alone will guarantee a large number of acceptors at constant&#13;
or even falling acceptance rates, the proportion (not only the number) of&#13;
women using contraceptives must rise in order to reduce population growth.&#13;
The potential for this increase depends on the extent to which contraceptive&#13;
demand is currently being met: the larger the proportion currently using&#13;
contraceptives, the more difficult it will be to increase that proportion&#13;
(ceteris paribus). In this sense, there does exist a potential saturation&#13;
problem in Thailand, since 37% of married women are currently using&#13;
contraceptives. Unmet demand exists to the extent that women who want no&#13;
more children are not using contraceptives. Of course not all these women&#13;
will accept contraceptives even if available,/l but they are more likely to&#13;
do so than others.&#13;
2.47      The extent of current use and the potential for future use differ&#13;
substantially by region (see Table 21), and thus the problem of increasing the&#13;
overall usage rate in Thailand must be approached on a regional basis. For&#13;
example, in the North the number of acceptors between 1974 and 1976 equalled a&#13;
third of the married women of reproductive ages /2 and the World Fertility&#13;
Survey (WFS) estimates that 44% of the nonpregnant married women in the North&#13;
and 45% in the Central Region were using contraceptives in 1975 (see Table&#13;
21), but figures for the Northeast and South were only 30% and 18% respectively&#13;
In the North and Central Region, another 30% were potentially interested in&#13;
contraceptives since they wanted no more children, were fecund and were not&#13;
currently practicing contraception. In the Northeast this figure was 40% and&#13;
in the South 38%;/3 the latter figure is surprisingly low given the low usage&#13;
in the South, but could be due to the higher desired family size (4.1 compared&#13;
to 3.3 and 3.4 in the North and Center, respectively). Thus, the usage&#13;
patterns of contraception result from large differences in the number of&#13;
children desired, the number ever born (therefore the number of women who want&#13;
no more children) and in the usage rates among those who do not want more&#13;
children. The South and Bangkok have smaller percentages of women who want no&#13;
more children, but the South has very high rates of nonusage by women who want&#13;
no more children; this reflects the fact that contraception is less acceptable&#13;
in the South. Therefore, there is still potential for expanded contraceptive&#13;
acceptance even if family size goals do not change, but such expansion will&#13;
become more difficult. The substantial differentials in desired family size&#13;
by region (e.g. high levels in the Northeast and South) would allow substan-&#13;
tial increases in potential acceptors as a result of decreases in the level&#13;
of desired fertility. Increased availability of contraceptives and changes&#13;
/1  The SOFT survey found that 27% of the fertile women who had family sizes&#13;
in excess of desired family size did not intend to use contraceptives in&#13;
the future.&#13;
/2  The acceptors are asked if they have ever used a contraceptive method&#13;
previously. If they have, they should not be classified as new acceptors.&#13;
/3  The higher actual and potential acceptance in the Northeast relative&#13;
to the South results in part from the somewhat higher number of children&#13;
ever born. Sixty-two percent of the women in the Northeast wanted no&#13;
more children versus 45% in the South.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

in demand factors should be helpful in increasing acceptance, and family&#13;
planning policies should give special attention to these areas. The SOFT&#13;
survey shows that urban residence, education and income are all inversely&#13;
related to desired family size. Thus, some reduction in desired family size&#13;
can occur naturally in the course of development. How this decline can be&#13;
accelerated in the short run is uncertain, but further analysis of the data&#13;
from the SOFT survey should give insight into this problem.&#13;

Internal Migration&#13;
2.48      The population of Thailand is relatively immobile, e.g. between&#13;
1965 and 1970, only just over 6% of the population over four moved across&#13;
changwat boundaries, and in all regions except the Center, net migration was&#13;
less than 1% of the population. However, attention is usually focused on&#13;
Bangkok with its atypical migration pattern. In 1970, 86% of the population&#13;
of Thailand were living in the changwat in which they were born (87% in&#13;
1960), but in Bangkok only 67% of the population in both years were natives&#13;
of the city. This is not to say that migration is unimportant or will&#13;
continue to remain small. Migration increased substantially between 1955-60&#13;
and 1965-70 and migration theory suggests that it will continue to increase&#13;
as economic development progresses. Even now migration has a substantial&#13;
impact on selected age groups and changwats.&#13;
2.49      The pattern of migration in the various changwats is illustrated&#13;
in Figure 3, which shows net migration rates for 1965-70, and by Table 22.&#13;
The low rates of migration outside the Center result in part from the fact&#13;
that each region has changwats of both very high emigration and high immigra-&#13;
tion. At the regional level these migration patterns cancel each other out&#13;
to some extent, and only slightly over 40% of the inter-changwat migration was&#13;
interregional. Bangkok and the Eastern Central Region had the highest net&#13;
immigration. At the changwat level, Kamphaeng Phet in the North, Rayong in&#13;
the Center, Nong Khai in the Northeast and Satun in the South all had net&#13;

immigration of over 10%.  The major regions of net emigration were the West&#13;
and Sub-Central. Emigration was less concentrated at the changwat level than&#13;
immigration and no changwat had net emigration over 8.4%. The pattern of&#13;
inflows and outflows is suggested by Figure 4 which shows the greater concen-&#13;
tration of immigration than emigration.&#13;

differences in method of calculation.&#13;
2.50      The pattern of migration has changed somewhat since 1955-60.&#13;
Overall, migration has increased: in 1955-60, 3.8% of the population&#13;
over four moved across changwat boundaries; in 1965-70, 6% did so. Estimates&#13;
of regional net migration rates differ somewhat as shown in Table 22. The&#13;
-fends however are consistent. Between 1955-60 and 1965-70, net immigration&#13;
to Bangkok increased. All other regions showed either greater net emigration,&#13;
or as in the North lower net immigration. Thus, Bangkok is increasingly&#13;
becoming the focus of immigration. This is largely due to limitations in the&#13;
availability of new land which encourages immigration out of and discourages&#13;
emigration into rural areas.&#13;
2.51      In Thailand, males are more likely to migrate than females, but the&#13;
ratio of male to female migrants differs substantially by age group (see&#13;
Table 23) and the proportion of female migrants increased significantly&#13;
between 1955-60 and 1965-70. For both males and females, the 20s are the&#13;
major years of migration. This concentration existed in both 1955-60 and&#13;
1965-70, but for women and to a lesser extent for men there was an increase&#13;
in the proportion of migrants in the 10-19 year age group, which resulted in&#13;
more female than male migrants in this age group in 1965-70.&#13;

2.52      The role of migration in the process of urbanization is of extreme&#13;
interest from a policy perspective, but there is relatively little information&#13;
available in Thailand on this subject. Analysis of this phenomenon is compli-&#13;
cated by the necessity for separating Bangkok from other urban areas, because&#13;
different factors determine the growth of provincial urban areas. However,&#13;
while migration is very important in determining the growth of urban areas,&#13;
the flow of migrants from rural to urban areas constitutes only about 12% of&#13;
total internal migration. Seventy-two percent of migration was between rural&#13;
areas, and a flow of 180,000 migrants from urban to rural areas constituted&#13;
5.4% of total migration. A further 10% of total migration was between urban&#13;
areas; given the small proportion of the population that is urban, this&#13;
implies a highly mobile urban population. The relative importance of migration&#13;
for municipal areas is illustrated by the fact that about 20% of municipal&#13;
residents had migrated to that area within the last five years, while in&#13;
nonurban areas this figure was only 10%. In addition, a survey conducted by&#13;
Chulalongkorn University showed that 70% of the urban male heads of household&#13;
in 1970 were born outside their current place of residence.&#13;
2.53      The age-sex specific migration rates are much higher for urban areas&#13;
than for the country as a whole (see Table 24). The migrants to urban areas&#13;
are more highly concentrated in the younger ages of 10-19 than are those for&#13;
the country as a whole. In every urban area except Bangkok the 10-19 year age&#13;
group has the highest migration rate. Bangkok and the country as a whole have&#13;
the highest rates in the 20-24 year ages. In addition, urban areas outside&#13;
Bangkok have disproportionately high rates of migration in the over 60 age&#13;
group.&#13;
2.54      Migration to Bangkok and other urban areas differs substantially in&#13;
its rate and characteristics. During 1947-60, Bangkok grew by 118%, but this&#13;
rate slowed so that between 1960 and 1970 its population increased by only&#13;
46.5%. During the latter period, 13 changwats experienced faster increases in&#13;
their municipal population than Bangkok, but only partly because of migration.&#13;
The fact that migration has accelerated in provincial urban areas relative to&#13;
Bangkok can be deduced, however, from the larger prQportion of migrants to the&#13;
provincial urban areas in the last five years. The characteristics of migrants&#13;
to Bangkok and other urban areas also differ substantially. Migrants to&#13;
Bangkok were more likely to have come directly from rural areas while those to&#13;
provincial urban areas were more likely to have come from other urban areas.&#13;
In addition, the provincial urban areas attract a larger proportion of profes-&#13;
sional and administrative personnel.&#13;
Determinants of Migration&#13;
2.55      To understand the probable course of future migration it is useful&#13;
to examine the factors associated with differential levels of migration between&#13;
changwats in the 1965-70 period. Income levels and access to agricultural land&#13;
are generally considered to be push and pull factors encouraging immigration&#13;
and discouraging emigration. Cities are also thought to attract migrants.&#13;
Other factors facilitate or retard migration by affecting the availability of&#13;
information and ease of transportation. Although perfect measures of these&#13;
variables are not available, they have been approximated by level of gross&#13;
&#13;

provincial product per capita in 1967, proportion of area of changwat in farm&#13;
holdings 1962/63, proportion of the population in municipalities in 1970,&#13;
literacy level in 1970 (information availability) and distance to Bangkok (ease&#13;
of transportation). These factors were related in a series of regression&#13;
equations to the 1965-70 rates of in, out and net migration by changwat. In&#13;
the numerous equations several patterns emerge:&#13;
(a) for the whole Kingdom and the North and Northeast, emigration&#13;
is better explained by these factors than is immigration;/l&#13;
(b) in the whole Kingdom and the Central Region, per capita product has&#13;
a strong positive relationship with immigration and a weaker, mixed&#13;
relationship with emigration;&#13;
(c) land availability and distance to Bangkok have the strongest&#13;
relationships with emigration. The higher the proportion of&#13;
changwat area that was under farms in 1960, the higher the rate of&#13;
emigration and the lower the rate of immigration. If urban&#13;
opportunities. were the major pull factor, farmland would not be a&#13;
major factor in immigration.  Thus the importance of farmland in&#13;
the immigration equation suggests the significance of migration&#13;
between rural areas of Thailand in this period;&#13;
(d) the extent of urbanization in an area was positively related to the&#13;
rate of immigration in simple correlation, but the regression&#13;
results suggest that higher proportions of the municipal population&#13;
did not encourage net migration and might even have discouraged it&#13;
once the difference in income levels in the more urbanized areas is&#13;
taken into account, but the relationship was not statistically&#13;
significant;&#13;
(e) holding other factors constant, literacy level showed no constant&#13;
pattern in these data nor did expenditure per capita on education&#13;
in another data set./2 The effect of education is apparently&#13;
complex and data on individuals interviewed in the Chulalongkorn&#13;
study show that the more educated tend to migrate from rural&#13;
areas. This tends to lower the education level in the rural areas&#13;
and also in the urban area; and&#13;
(f) the role of Bangkok in determining migration patterns is, of course,&#13;
quite different from that of other cities. All other factors being&#13;
the same, immigration is higher for Bangkok and emigration is&#13;
/1  The adjusted R2s are almost twice as high for emigration as immigration.&#13;
Over half of the variance in emigration was explained by these variables&#13;
(see Table 25 for equations).&#13;
/2  Within the Central Region, higher literacy levels were associated with&#13;
higher immigration and lower emigration.&#13;

lower. In addition, the further an area is from Bangkok, the lower&#13;
its rate of emigration ii' all other factors are held constant./l&#13;
2456      These results suggest that migration streams will flow towLards the&#13;
areas of highest income and available land, and the closer an area is to&#13;
Bangkok the greater the rate of outflow. They also suggest that increased&#13;
pressure on land will increase the flow of migration. While this migration&#13;
may be directed towards the urban areas, this might in some ways be a second&#13;
choice of migrants. It appears from the regressions that high incomes are&#13;
the major factor attracting migrants to an area, while high municipal populations&#13;
and low land availability are discouraging factors. Bangkok's high immigration&#13;
may simpLy be the result of lack of opportunities in the rural sector and&#13;
could be slowed substantially by programs to raise income and increase land&#13;
availability in rural areas. This argument is supposed by Suwanlu Piampiti in a&#13;
1974 dissertation on Thai migration which concluded that some changes ir. the&#13;
pattern of migration between 1955-60 and 1965-70 reflect the success of rural&#13;
development under the first and second five-year plans./2&#13;
3. POPULATIiN PROJECTIONS&#13;
Total Population&#13;
3.01      The analysis of mortality and fertility presented above can be usad&#13;
to evaluace the likely course of population growth in Thailand. The NSO anc&#13;
NESDB have prepared three populatioc projections for 1970 to 2010 which are&#13;
summarized in Table 26. These are the projections used as the basis for the&#13;
Fourth Five-Year Plan. By 1990 the three projections differ by less than&#13;
' million (about a 10% difference) but by 2010 the difference exceeds 33 mil--&#13;
lion.  But even in the shorter period, 1970-90, the different projections gixe&#13;
fairly large differences in the age structure of the population (see Table 27),&#13;
e g. the high projection gives over 40% of the population under 15 by 1990 ani&#13;
the low gives 33%. All projections, of course, register a decline in the&#13;
proportion in this age group from the 1970 level of 45%. However, while&#13;
declines in proportions in the your,g age group give some basis for optimism on&#13;
c&gt;i~t- of the economy to achieve higher levels of income and savings, the&#13;
aBsolute size of increases in these age groups will be suDstantial, since even&#13;
under the low projection the number ctf children under 15 will increase by over&#13;
18% or 3 million children between 1970 and 1980. The implications of these&#13;
projections for achieving national development goals wil, be discussed more&#13;
tully after the assumptions underly3ng the projections have been assessed in&#13;
lJght of past trends and probable changes in factocs .&#13;
/1 This applies to all migration, not jiust migration to Bangkok. St:udies&#13;
on the 1960 and 1970 censuses :zhow that migration to Bangkok is negatively&#13;
correlat:ed with distance in a ;'onlinear fsctor.  Three hundred kilometers&#13;
appeared to be the critical distance, since distan-e 'ad virtuially&#13;
no effect beyond this.&#13;

3.02      The three projections assume international migration to be minimal.&#13;
Since World War II, international migration has contributed very little to&#13;
population growth in Thailand (less than 9% growth since 1937). Therefore,&#13;
the discussion of national trends will concentrate on the crude birth and&#13;
death rate. However, since the end of the Viet Nam war, the inflow of&#13;
refugees has been far greater than other recent immigration and is viewed as&#13;
a serious threat to Thailand's attempts at economic growth and population&#13;
stabilization./l Realistic policies must deal with this problem, and the&#13;
conflicts over this issue may prove to be far more difficult to resolve than&#13;
those over family planning policies.&#13;
3.03      The three projections all assume an annual increase in life expectancy&#13;
of one-third of a year from 1970-90; this seems to be fairly realistic in&#13;
light of past trends in mortality. It falls between the two estimated values&#13;
of life expectancy increases in the last 10 years - a half and a fifth of a&#13;
year annually.&#13;
3.04      The projections do, however, differ in their fertility assumptions,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Projection I (high fertility): The fertility rate would decline&#13;
by 4% for each five-year interval between 1975 and 1990.&#13;
Projection II (medium fertility): The fertility rate would&#13;
decline by 10% for each five-year period.&#13;
Projection III (low fertility): Fertility decline will be more&#13;
rapid and consistent with the family planning program targets;&#13;
growth rate of 2.1 will be reached in 1981 and fall to 1.73 in&#13;
1985-90.&#13;
The decline in the general fertility rate and crude birth rate in each&#13;
assumption is shown in Table 28. The three projections should be evaluated&#13;
by the realism of these assumptions. Given that the 1974/75 crude birth rate&#13;
was already down to 37, and given past and projected acceptance rates, the&#13;
fertility decline in the high projection seems too conservative.  Therefore,&#13;
discussion of the projections will concentrate on the medium and low fertility&#13;
projections. The 10% fertility decline per five-year period seems reasonable,&#13;
given the estimates of a fertility decline of 20% between 1960 and 1975 and&#13;
given the various estimates of the current birth rate, and represents a quite&#13;
gradual decline in comparison with the experience of other countries that&#13;
have recently undergone demographic transition (see Table 29). If anything,&#13;
the medium decline represents a conservative estimate, since it implies a&#13;
2.64% natural increase in 1975-80 and there is wide consensus that this&#13;
growth rate is already close to 2.5%. The more rapid fertility decline of&#13;
the low projections between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s would closely parallel&#13;
the experience of Korea and Taiwan between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s.&#13;
Whether the rate of development and redistribution of income will combine&#13;
with expanded family planning programs to achieve this rapid rate is uncertain&#13;
/1 See Fourth Five-Year Plan, p. 105.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
but possible. Therefore it is the mission's best estimate that population&#13;
growth will lie between the medium and the low projection. It should be&#13;
stressed that all Thai Government agencies officially use the low fertility&#13;
projections. Whether the rapid decline materializes depends on policies with&#13;
respect to eliminating regional disparities in welfare and developing a&#13;
family planning program that uses an appropriate strategy for each region.&#13;

3.05      The projected populations by age for the two projections are given&#13;
in Table 30. These projections are identical at most ages and time periods,&#13;
and where this is the case only one number is given. The only difference&#13;
during the period of the Fourth Plan will be in the number of children under&#13;
6. The only programs affected within the plan would be the preschool health&#13;
and nutrition program. In the post-1980 period, the medium and low projections&#13;
imply very different sizes of school age population.&#13;
3.06      Through the plan period there is fair certainty of size of the&#13;
population aged 5 and above. The difference in total population size in the&#13;
two projections in 1981 (not shown on table) is only 719,000, i.e. less than&#13;
1-1/2% of the total population. Thus there is little hope of avoiding the&#13;
consequences of past growth even with the most rapid fertility decline possible.&#13;
In 1981, the population will be between 48.2 million and 48.9 million, which&#13;
represents an increase of at least 6 million people who must be supported.&#13;
About 5,304,000 people will enter the working ages (15-19), an increase of&#13;
802,000 from 1975.  The number of additional 10 to 14 year olds will be&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

6,129,000 (an increase of 774,000 since 1975) and of 5 to 9 year olds, 6,591,000&#13;
(an increase of 406,000). The higher number of additional children in the upper&#13;
age reflects the impact of the fertility declines in the past 10 years and&#13;
implies fairly dramatic differences in potential problems of adjusting the&#13;
school system to growth. As long as the birth rate is constant, additions at&#13;
lower grades will surpass those at upper grades and emphasis on primary school&#13;
expansion is necessary. However, the decline in birth rates implies a relative&#13;
increase in the demand for upper primary and secondary school places for&#13;
demographic as well as other reasons. Thus, the fertility decrease in the&#13;
past will imply a relative slackening in the need for primary school places&#13;
and an increase in upper levels of education and in the demand for new jobs.&#13;

Projected Regional Growth&#13;
3.07      As indicated above, the regions of Thailand differ substantially in&#13;
their rates of natural increase and level of migration. Therefore, regional&#13;
population changes cannot simply be estimated from a fixed relationship with&#13;
the national population. For this reason the Government's Population Projec-&#13;
tion Working Group prepared a set of regional projections by the component&#13;
method, which requires age-specific assumptions of mortality, fertility and&#13;
migration trends for each region. Unfortunately, the report on the projections&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
has not yet been published in English. However, some description of the&#13;
projections is contained in a paper prepared by Jawalaksana Rachapaetayakom&#13;
for the East-West Center in July 1975, and other details have been deduced&#13;
from working papers prepared in the last several years by NESDB. These&#13;
regional projections prepared by NSO/NESDB will be compared with an alternative&#13;
projection prepared by the mission.&#13;
3.08      The Working Group Projections are made on a seven region breakdown:&#13;
North              -   Standard 16 changwats&#13;
South              -   Standard 14 changwats&#13;
Northeast          -   Standard 15 changwats&#13;
Central East       -   Chon Buri, Chantiburi, Chachoengsao, Nakhon&#13;
Nayok, Trat, Prachin Buri, Rayon&#13;
Central West       -   Nakhon Pathom, Rat Buri, Phet Buri,&#13;
Kanchanaburi, Prachuab Khiri Khan, Samut&#13;
Sakhom, Samut Songkhram, Suphan Buri&#13;
Central Central   -   Other central&#13;
Bangkok            -   Thonburi&#13;
The difference between this breakdown and the standard division is that the&#13;
Central Region outside Bangkok is broken into three regions. The projections&#13;
are constructed for each region assuming that: (a) life expectancy increases&#13;
by one-third of a year annually starting at the life expectancies shown&#13;
earlier in this report; (b) fertility will fall at the rate assumed under the&#13;
low projection discussed above, and the regional and age-specific fertility&#13;
rates will all fall proportionately; and (c) migration rates between regions&#13;
increase for another 10 years and then level off. The increases in migration&#13;
rates for 1975-90 are projections of the rates of increase between 1960-65 and&#13;
1965-70. The age-specific migration rates are all assumed to change propor-&#13;
tionately.&#13;
3.09      These assumptions imply the regional populations shown in Table 31.&#13;
This table also reports the proportion of population in each region in each&#13;
year. The Central Region, including Bangkok, gains population over the period&#13;
as a result of a small decrease in the proportions in other areas. Within&#13;
the Central Region, Bangkok and the East Central increase their proportions&#13;
and those of the other central regions experience a decrease.&#13;
3.10      The age structure of the regional populations also changes over the&#13;
period (see Table 32), although it already varies as a result of differential&#13;
fertility and migration patterns. In 1975, Bangkok had a very low proportion&#13;
of the population under 15, and the Northeast had an extremely high proportion.&#13;
The other regions had a fairly similar age structure in 1975. By 1985, the&#13;
divergence in the proportion under 15 by region will narrow somewhat as a&#13;
result of fertility declines in all regions. However, the differences in the&#13;
proportion in the working ages remain, even though this proportion increases&#13;
by at least five points in all regions. The persistent differences in&#13;
working age population reflect differences in migration patterns between&#13;
regions.&#13;

3.11      The regional proJections are based on the assumption of rapid&#13;
fertility declines.  It was assumed that given this low fertility assumption,&#13;
the regional and age-specific fertility differentials will not be affected by&#13;
the changes in the overall level of fertility. That is, the fertility decline&#13;
is assumed to be proportional across all groups. The general fertility rates&#13;
implied by this assumption are presented in the last columns of Table 33. In&#13;
that table these projected rates can be compared with regional rates that&#13;
have been observed in recent fertility surveys.&#13;

3.12      For the whole Kingdom, the initial fertility rates appear quite&#13;
reasonable or if anything slightly high compared to observed values in 1970&#13;
and 1974/75. However, the rate of fertility decline projected appears to be&#13;
somewhat rapid and the regional breakdown of fertility based on the 1970&#13;
figures does not accord well with the 1974/75 figures. In 1970-75, general&#13;
fertility rates appear to be too low for the Northeast and South and too high&#13;
r -ne North, Central and Bangkok areas. For these reasons an alternative&#13;
projection has been developed based on the medium rather than the rapid&#13;
fertility decline and on the 1974/75 regional levels of fertility from the&#13;
1974/75 Survey of Population Change, and these rates were assumed to decline&#13;
at a rate of 10% per five-year interval /1 (the medium projection assumption).&#13;
This projection uses the same mortality and migration assumptions as the&#13;
Working Group's projection. The resulting regional projections are reported&#13;
in Tables 34 and 35. These medium regional projections report a total&#13;
population for Thailand of 47,620,000 in 1980 and 54,077,000 in 1985. This&#13;
is fairly close to the figures produced by NESDB's aggregate medium-term&#13;
projection of 47,686,000 in 1980 and 53,851,000 in 1985.&#13;
/1 The projections given here were obtained by lowering the total fertility&#13;
rates sufficiently to provide a 10% decline in the general fertility&#13;
rates. Since the correspondence between the two is not always exact, TFRs&#13;
had to be reduced faster than 10% to reach a 10% decline in GFRs.&#13;

3.13      Comparing the medium and low fertility projections, there is a&#13;
difference in the regional distribution as well as the expected difference in&#13;
overall size. By 1985, the Northeast, and to a lesser extent the South, have&#13;
a larger share of the population under the medium assumption and the North&#13;
has a lower share. The most remarkable differences, however, occur in the age&#13;
structure of the regional populations under both assumptions, with major&#13;
differences again existing in the areas outside the Central Region.  In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
examining the age structure, it must be recalled that the medium projections&#13;
included a slower rate of decline, but also started fron different regional&#13;
levels of fertility than the NESDB assumption. The medium projection predic-&#13;
tably shows a much larger proportion of population under 15 in the Northeast&#13;
and South than did the low projection. These differences are very large - 44&#13;
versus 40, and 42 rather than 38.&#13;
4. CURRENT WELFARE SITUATION&#13;
4.01      While Thailand has shown an excellent record of national growth and&#13;
development, the benefits of this progress have not been enjoyed to the same&#13;
extent by all groups in the population. Overall, however, in terms of educa-&#13;
tion and health, Thailand is relatively well off for its level of income: it&#13;
has a literacy rate of 82% and a life expectancy of between 58 and 62 years&#13;
(see Table 36 for comparison with several Asian countries). Thailand is&#13;
closest to the Philippines in terms of income level but has a higher literacy&#13;
rate and higher life expectancy. Only Sri Lanka appears to perform better&#13;
than Thailand for its level of income in measures of health and literacy.&#13;

4.02      Despite its excellent record at the national level, income, health&#13;
and welfare differ substantially between urban and rural areas and among&#13;
regions (see Table 37), and reduction of these inequalities is a major&#13;
goal of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. For the whole Kingdom the levels are&#13;
given for each indicator, and for each region the ratio of its irdicator to&#13;
that of the whole Kingdom is given with 100 as the base. The indicators have&#13;
all been constructed in such a way that the higher the value, the better the&#13;
level of welfare./1 These regional data are far from being as uniform as&#13;
might have been anticipated. In particular, the Northeast does not rank&#13;
lowest on all the variables. On health and education the North, and in some&#13;
cases the South, fare worse than the Northeast.&#13;
4.03      While there is thus a varied regional pattern, there is great&#13;
uniformity with respect to urban-rural differentials (see Table 38). The&#13;
rural areas are consistently worse off than urban areas, with the ratio of&#13;
urban to rural welfare ranging from 1.04 to 22.0. While health and education&#13;
show the smallest differentials, they are perhaps the most important variables.&#13;
The difference of almost 11 years in life expectancy between urban and rural&#13;
areas is certainly of monumental importance despite the fact that the ratio&#13;
is only 1.17. Likewise, infant mortality in rural areas is 2.4 times that in&#13;
urban areas. Differences in sanitation levels are contributing factors to&#13;
health differentials. Sanitation differentials can be measured by the propor-&#13;
tion of households with flush toilets and piped water, and these differentials&#13;
are the highest observed with ratios of 7.7 and 21.8, respectively. Thus a&#13;
major policy implication of this analysis is the need to reduce urban-rural&#13;
differentials in sanitation./2&#13;
/1  This method tends to suppress variability in some cases.  For example,&#13;
infant mortality in the North is 71% above that for the country as a whole&#13;
(96 versus 56), but infant survival rates in the North are only 4% below&#13;
the whole Kingdom (904 per 1,000 rather than 944).&#13;
/2 Sanitation is especially important in rural areas that are fairly closely&#13;
settled and where the water table is relatively close to the surface.&#13;

4.04      To develop policies for eliminating welfare differences among the&#13;
various areas of Thailand, it is necessary to understand why these differences&#13;
arise. To some extent they result from different natural resource endowments&#13;
per capita which must be compensated for by either increasing man-made&#13;
resources or encouraging migration from the poorly endowed areas. Alterna-&#13;
tively differences in welfare may arise from existing inequalities in govern-&#13;
ment expenditures. To determine the relative importance of these factors,&#13;
multiple regression has been used to "explain" changwat variations in a number&#13;
of measures of welfare. This usage of "explain" does not imply that factors&#13;
actually affect welfare, but rather the equations show what proportion of&#13;
variation in welfare is associated with variations in these other factors./l&#13;
Since many of the explanatory factors move together, it is difficult to&#13;
uniquely associate variations in welfare with variations in one explanatory&#13;
factor. To show the relative importance of urbanization, socioeconomic,&#13;
regional and subregional /2 factors, a large number of equations were run for&#13;
/1 Explanation in a statistical sense does not mean explanation in a logical&#13;
sense. Logical explanation requires the development of causal models.&#13;
Statistical explanation such as that above does not show that one set of&#13;
variables causes changes in other variables, but only that the variables&#13;
are loosely related. This statistical analysis then is a first step&#13;
toward the more difficult process of developing causal models.&#13;
/2 The subregions are based on those used in the subregional profiles in the&#13;
main volume of this report.  In the subregional equations, the base region&#13;
for comparison is the group of changwats comprising the Bangkok Metro-&#13;
politan Area, the three Samut changwats and the Central Plain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

each measure of welfare. Table 39 shows how much of the variation in each&#13;
welfare measure was explained by each of the four categories of variables&#13;
taken separately and together. Thus column 1 shows that urbanization explains&#13;
only 1% of the difference in measured mortality, but 81% of the variation in&#13;
the proportion of the population with piped water. Columns 1 thru 4 show that&#13;
in four cases urbanization has the greatest explanatory power. Subregional&#13;
variables are most important for literacy, mortality, and sanitation and&#13;
housing. Regional variables were most important in explaining educational&#13;
expenditures. In no case was the socioeconomic category the most important.&#13;
Combining different categories of variables increases explanatory power as&#13;
shown in the other columns of Table 39.&#13;
4.05      To show the relative importance of variables within the different&#13;
categories, the results of multiple regression equations using urbanization,&#13;
socioeconomic and subregional variables are shown in Table 40. Of the&#13;
socioeconomic variables, the proportion urban is statistically significant in&#13;
all equations except mortality, proportion literate and building material&#13;
used./l This reflects the wide urban-rural differences observed in most&#13;
measures of welfare. These results show that urban-rural differences do not&#13;
result from socioeconomic or expenditure differences alone, since these&#13;
variables have been controlled. In particular, gross provincial product per&#13;
capita, GPP, is not significant in any equation except that for sanitation.&#13;
This does not indicate that income is unimportant in explaining welfare (see&#13;
Table 41), but rather that urbanization is extremely important in explaining&#13;
both income and other types of welfare.&#13;
4.06      The only significant socioeconomic variables other than proportion&#13;
urban are:&#13;
(a)  educational expenditures in 1967 in explaining percentage literate&#13;
in 1970;&#13;
(b)  farmland per capita in 1962 in explaining GPP per capita in 1967;&#13;
(c)  distance from Bangkok in explaining educational expenditures; and&#13;
(d)  income in 1967 in explaining sanitation in 1970.&#13;
In most instances the socioeconomic variables have the direction of relation-&#13;
ship expected. The only major exception is that for farmland per capita's&#13;
inverse association with GPP in 1967. This results, in part, from the&#13;
relationship of this variable with urbanization. If proportion urban is&#13;
/1 The large urban-rural differences in mortality are not reflected here,&#13;
primarily because data used are drawn from the imperfect vital registra-&#13;
tion system rather than from the more precise sample surveys, which do&#13;
not cover all changwats. In urban areas, mortality registration is more&#13;
complete than in the rural areas, and thus the measure of mortality&#13;
is systematically biased.&#13;

deleted, then farmland has a positive but insignificant coefficient. The&#13;
anomolous result probably reflects the great difference in land quality and&#13;
water availability in the various regions. Thus, while the Northeast has&#13;
fairly large farm holdings,/1 the land is of relatively poor quality and&#13;
water is not plentiful year round.&#13;
/1  Average farm holdings are 31.7 rai in the Northeast, 38.5 in the Center,&#13;
9 in the North and 24.7 in the South.&#13;

4.07      The subregional variables show patterns similar to those observed in&#13;
the regional comparisons in Table 37. There does appear to be more uniformity&#13;
among subregions in the North and Northeast than elsewhere./I With respect to&#13;
most variables these regions are below the Central Plain. The only exceptions&#13;
are literacy in the Northeast and education expenditures in the North. For&#13;
each variable the subregions within these regions all show the same direction&#13;
of relationship. The South and the East and West Central show different&#13;
directions of relationship on several variables. The lower South and West-&#13;
Central have generally lower measures of welfare than the Upper South and East&#13;
Central.&#13;
4.08      While the directions of relationships are internally uniform for&#13;
subregions in the North and Northeast, there are differences of magnitude&#13;
which are large in several instances: (a) the Upper Northeast has substan-&#13;
tially higher mortality than the rest of the region and somewhat lower&#13;
educational expenditures per capita; (b) the lower Northeast does not have&#13;
literacy rates, as large ceteris paribus as the rest of the region; (c) the&#13;
Upper North has even lower literacy rates than the Lower North, and both are&#13;
significantly below those of the Central Plain-Bangkok-Samut base subregion;&#13;
(d) however to compensate for this, in 1967 expenditures on education in the&#13;
Upper North were significantly higher than in the base region and much above&#13;
those in the Lower North; and (e) health expenditures in the Lower North were&#13;
significantly lower than in the base region and very much below those in the&#13;
Upper North.&#13;
4.09      Overall, the subregions are quite important in explaining differ-&#13;
ences in welfare even after controlling for urbanization. The only exceptions&#13;
are the proportion of houses with piped water, which is almost completely&#13;
explained by urbanization, and GPP in 1973 which is significantly related to&#13;
urbanization, but GDP per capita is poorly explained overall.&#13;
4.10      While eliminating residential and regional differences in welfare&#13;
would obviously increase equality in Thailand, the above analysis does not&#13;
indicate exactly how this is to be done. For literacy, things are fairly&#13;
straightforward and appear to be a function of expenditure levels, since&#13;
urbanization is significantly related to literacy in 1970./2 Some regional&#13;
compensaticn for differences at the primary level appears to be taking place,&#13;
so than regions with low literacy have higher expenditures in an attempt to&#13;
achieve equality of primary education in Thailand. Measures of secondary&#13;
education would not be expected to show the same pattern.&#13;
/1 One exception is for piped water in the Upper Northeast. This is positive&#13;
rather than negative in other parts of the region. This seems to be the&#13;
result of differential urbanization, since when urbanization is deleted&#13;
this subregion has the same negative sign as the other two.&#13;
/2  This may seem to be too obvious to warrant attention.  However, school&#13;
attendance can be limited either by a lack of supply (schools or teachers)&#13;
or a lack of demand for education. This result seems to indicate that it&#13;
is the lack of supply of education rather than demand that limits attainment&#13;
of literacy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
4.11      For health, the analysis is rather weak due to poor data on mortil tN.&#13;
However, despite the fact that urbanization, income and health expenditures&#13;
are not significant in the health equation, large regional and urban-rural&#13;
differentials in mortality exist. Income, health expenditures and sanitatinn&#13;
are all factors explaining these differentials, and health expenditures and&#13;
sanitation can be directly affected by government action. The regression&#13;
equation shows that health expenditures were not being made to equalize&#13;
health factors since the areas with highest mortality, the rural areas and&#13;
the North, have significantly lower expenditures while the South has sign!'&#13;
cantly higher expenditures, but lower mortality. Overall, economic ar'&#13;
social expenditures per capita in the Third Plan were not distributed in su'1,&#13;
a way as to equalize regional differentials (see Table 42). Unfortunately.&#13;
in most instances, the expenditure pattern of the Fourth Plan has not becn&#13;
broken down regionally or by urban and rural areas. However, a regional&#13;
planning effort would seem critical for eliminating differentials.&#13;
4.12      In the future, some change in welfare differentials can be expected&#13;
independent of government policy. This will result from changes in population&#13;
growth and the age structure resulting from differential patterns of migration&#13;
and fertility. In addition, the distribution of population between urban and&#13;
rural areas and among regions is anticipated to change in the future because&#13;
of internal migration and differential rates of natural increase.&#13;
5. IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION GROWTH FOR WELFARE&#13;
5.01      Population size, growth and age structure have been hypothesized&#13;
to have important effects on income levels, savings rates (public and private)&#13;
and employment. However, the exact magnitude of their effects has yet to be&#13;
established in any economy because of the multitude of other factors that&#13;
determine income, growth and employment; thus an exact measure of population's&#13;
impact can only be made if many assumptions are made about these other vari-&#13;
ables. Therefore, only a modest attempt will be made to identify several ways&#13;
in which population growth will affect the welfare of the Thai population. In&#13;
examining population's effect up to 1985, there are four kinds of population&#13;
change that need to be considered: (a) change in overall size; (b) change in&#13;
the proportion at various ages; (c) change in the number of those of working&#13;
age; and (d) change in the number of school age children. These dimensions of&#13;
population dynamics can be examined from the national and regional perspective.&#13;
The two projections discussed above differ somewhat in their growth rates and&#13;
thus the size of population in 1980 and 1985. They also differ to some extent&#13;
in the overall age structure; in particular they differ substantially in&#13;
students of lower primary school age by 1985. They do not differ in the&#13;
numbers in ages over five in 1980 or over ten in 1985.  Thus, for 1985 discus-&#13;
sions of labor force entrants and enrollment in upper primary and secondary&#13;
schools are completely determined by past growth, whether future growth&#13;
follows the medium or low projection. Thus the impact of population growth&#13;
needs to be discussed in different degrees of detail.&#13;

5.02      Labor force growth depends on the population at various ages and&#13;
labor participation rates. Trends in these variables have been discussed at -&#13;
the national level in the main volume of this report. Therefore, it is only&#13;
necessary to mention regional differentials. Table 43 shows the number of&#13;
15-19 and 20-24 year olds in 1975, 1980 and 1985 and the growth between&#13;
these years./l These will represent potential additions to the labor force,&#13;
partly offset by older age groups dropping out of the labor force. Whether&#13;
these additions will increase or reduce average welfare depends on the&#13;
employment opportunities available. In the rural areas availability of&#13;
farmland is an important limit of agricultural employment. The opportunities&#13;
for employment growth from this source are discussed below and the overall&#13;
employment creation problem is discussed elsewhere in the report. To some&#13;
extent the differentials in the growth of young workers at the regional level&#13;
are the consequence of the availability of employment opportunities that&#13;
encourage immigration or emigration. Thus regional differentials in those&#13;
entering the labor force reflect regional differences in projected employment&#13;
opportunities which are implied in the migration assumptions. At the national&#13;
level the growth of the labor force is not responsive to employment opportun-&#13;
ities in the short run.&#13;

5.03      Population size per se has its most obvious effects on the amount&#13;
of fixed resources, particularly farmland per capita. Table 44 summarizes&#13;
the land holdings per capita by region in 1975 and under various assumptions&#13;
in the future. These are very rough estimates and no attempt has been made to&#13;
separate urban and rural populations, except for the exclusion of Bangkok.&#13;
These estimates show that even if all the suitable forest and scrub land is&#13;
brought into production by 1985, the Kingdom as a whole, the Center and&#13;
especially the Northeast will have substantial reductions in farmland per&#13;
capita. This will increase pressures for farmers to leave agriculture and/or&#13;
leave the rural areas. If new land can be brought into cultivation, then the&#13;
North with its lower rate of population growth will show constant or slightly&#13;
increasing farmland per capita. The South has the potential to substantially&#13;
increase farmland per capita despite its higher rate of population growth.&#13;
These trends will tend to worsen the level of welfare of the Northeast and&#13;
improve that of the South, thus widening regional differentials in farm income&#13;
ceteris paribus. Two factors may counterbalance this trend. First, the&#13;
intensity of land use, as measured by the proportion of planted area of&#13;
croppable holdings, varies substantially by region, with the Northeast having&#13;
lower intensity than average and the South and Center having far above average&#13;
use intensity. Thus, if land use intensity can be raised in the Northeast,&#13;
the effects of land scarcity and rapid population growth might be substantially&#13;
offset. The South and Center have little potential for improved production&#13;
from this source. The second factor is increased migration. An increased&#13;
flow from the Northeast to the South would seem the most natural flow given&#13;
our analysis of the effect of land availability on migration and would tend to&#13;
equalize land holdings per capita. However, such migration might well have&#13;
some negative effects on welfare in the Northeast and positive effects on&#13;
welfare in the South (increasing regional disparities) because it is selective&#13;
of prime age males and would raise the dependency rate in the Northeast and&#13;
lower it in the South.&#13;

5.04      Dependency can be expected to change greatly in the next 10 years&#13;
because of changes in fertility as well as migration. For Thailand as a&#13;
whole, the proportion of the population under 15 will fall substantially&#13;
between 1975 and 1985 as shown in Table 27, but will fall much faster under&#13;
the low fertility assumption (33% versus 37%). At the regional level,&#13;
dependency varied substantially in 1975 (from 34% in Bangkok to 47% in the&#13;
Northeast) and these rates will fall depending on what assumptions are made&#13;
about migration and fertility. Dependency data in Tables 32 and 35 show that&#13;
the North can be expected to have greater potential than other areas for&#13;
improvements due to a very rapid decline in dependency under either the low&#13;
or medium projection. This is true to a lesser extent for the East Central.&#13;
While all areas will have declines in dependency, these will be most dramatic&#13;
in the North. Again, the Northeast is in at least as bad a position as any&#13;
other region and shows the lowest relative benefit from declining proportions&#13;
of young dependents, particularly under the medium projection.&#13;
5.05      Young age dependency affects family spending and thus private&#13;
savings in a somewhat uncertain manner. Its effects on public spending&#13;
are more straightforward but depend on the goals of education policy. We&#13;
shall briefly examine the implications of population growth in reaching the&#13;
expressed goals of the educational reform in Thailand as articulated in the&#13;
sector memorandum prepared as part of this mission.&#13;
5.06      Table 45 shows the number of primary places needed in 1980 and 1985&#13;
under the low and medium projections. These figures, however, can only be&#13;
interpreted if one makes an assumption about the repetition rate of students.&#13;
Currently lower primary enrollment exceeds the number of children of the&#13;
relevant ages in all areas except the Center. This is largely the result of&#13;
high rates of failure and repetition. If failures could be eliminated and&#13;
places were only needed for each student of the relevant age, then under the&#13;
medium projection at least through 1980 and under the low projection through&#13;
1985, no new positions would be needed despite population growth. If enroll-&#13;
ment rates (and failure rates) remain constant, 266,000 new places will be&#13;
needed under the most conservative estimate by 1980. Thus the problem of the&#13;
lower primary level is a combination of high failure rates and population&#13;
growth. These factors cause particularly serious problems for the Northeast&#13;
and the South where the proportion of new places needed will increase over&#13;
time. The North has lower failure rates and lower population growth and has a&#13;
somewhat more manageable problem, and under the medium projection its need for&#13;
places will begin to decline in 1985. The Central Region has much lower&#13;
failure rates and consequently its increase in primary places results only&#13;
from population growth.&#13;

the two estimates cover (a) current enrollment rates and (b) "improvements"&#13;
in rates so that 100% enrollment is attained.&#13;

5.07      Upper primary school places (years 5 and 6) will need to be&#13;
increased (see Table 46) if two years of schooling beyond lower primary is&#13;
to be universal, as planned. Over a million upper primary places will be&#13;
needed by 1980 and an additional 122,800 by 1985 will be needed to maintain&#13;
a universal level of six years of schooling. (The number of places needed&#13;
by 1985 is independent of fertility assumptions between now and 1985, since&#13;
all the children of the relevant ages are already born; this is also true of&#13;
secondary schooling.) These numbers underestimate actual need, however,&#13;
since no account is taken of failure rates. The serious problem of lack of&#13;
access to upper primary schools in the Northeast is illustrated by the fact&#13;
that 50% of the needed places in 1980 are in the Northeast which has only&#13;
35-36% of the population.&#13;

5.08      Two alternative scenarios for secondary schooling are discussed in&#13;
the sector memorandum.  In the first case 35% enrollment would be reached in&#13;
1985; in the second case 39% enrollment would be achieved in 1980 and 60% in&#13;
,1985 (see Table 47). Even the more modest goal requires over half a million&#13;
new places by 1980 and almost a million additional onles by 1985. The more&#13;
ambitious goal requires between 2-1/2 to 2-1/3 times as many places. In both&#13;
cases the Northeast requires the largest proportion of places (2/3 in 1980&#13;
under the low target). The growth in needed upper primary and secondary&#13;
places depends very much on the targets established, but even modest targets&#13;
require very large increases in school places. Current deficits in opportuni-&#13;
ties above lower primary level, particularly in the Northeast, require alloca-&#13;
tions of educational expenditures disproportionate to the population size of&#13;
the region.&#13;

5.09      Health care differs widely between regions and between urban and&#13;
rural areas as evidenced by the large differentials in life expectancy. To&#13;
some extent these differencials result from differences in sanitation and health&#13;
care. A major objective of the Fourth Five-Year Plan is to reduce urban-rural&#13;
differentials in physicians per capita and hospital beds per capita. Currently&#13;
the ratio of physicians to population is 1:1,863 in Bangkok and 1:30,863 in&#13;
other areas, but the ratio differs greatly among regions as can be seen in&#13;
Table 48. The plan targets are 1:1,639 in urban areas and 1:18,700 in rural&#13;
areas. In terms of hospital beds, the ratios are now 1:358 in urban areas and&#13;
1:900 elsewhere (with substantial regional differentials) and the targets,&#13;
1:117 and 1:617, respectively.&#13;
5.10      The implications of these goals and population growth for physicians&#13;
and hospital beds are shown in Tables 48 and 49.  The numbers needed are cal-&#13;
culated on the assumption that current ratios are maintained and that targets&#13;
are reached in 1980. This allows a rough determination of what proportion of&#13;

the need results from population growth alone. For the whole Kingdom in&#13;
1980, 49% of the increase in physicians needed results from population growth&#13;
alone and 46% results from an interaction of the two effects. For various&#13;
regions, the need for physicians and the source of that need differ dramatically.&#13;
Bangkok and the Northeast have the greatest need; but while in Bangkok the&#13;
need results largely from population growth and the exceptionally high current&#13;
and target levels relative to the rest of the country, in the Northeast it&#13;
results from the current low number of physicians and rapid population growth.&#13;
5.11      For hospital beds, 5% of the increased need comes from population&#13;
growth alone, 73% from the attempt to reach targets, and the interaction&#13;
effect is 22%. Again the Northeast and Bangkok are the major areas of need&#13;
for very different reasons. These results point out that in many respects&#13;
population growth is by no means the major problem in health care, though&#13;
it will contribute to the problem, particularly in the Northeast. The&#13;
results also cast doubt on the wisdom of trying to increase health care&#13;
substantially in Bangkok, given the huge differentials between Bangkok and&#13;
other areas and the huge resource absorbtion implied by the current very high&#13;
(relatively speaking) standards of health in Bangkok.&#13;
5.12      While this is only a rough analysis of the implications of popula-&#13;
tion growth for regional differencials in welfare, it is fairly conclusive in&#13;
showing that ceteris paribus welfare in the Northeast will tend to deteriorate&#13;
relative to the rest of Thailand. This situation can only be remedied by&#13;
disproportionate allocations to the Northeast. While slowing population&#13;
growth would help the Northeast, the consequences of previous high growth&#13;
rates are unavoidable. The situation in the North is quite different. Its&#13;
earlier and currently more rapid fertility reduction results in conditions&#13;
much more favorable to economic growth. The South, which is currently well&#13;
off relative to the North and Northeast, can expect difficulties arising&#13;
from rapid population growth, but its current surplus of available land can&#13;
mitigate these effects to some extent.&#13;

            The population of Thailand : its growth and welfare
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the last decade Thailand has
            experienced very rapid fertility decline. To what extent is
            this decline a consequence of the adoption of a national
            family planning program in 1970? Why has the decline
            differed so much by region? Is this a consequence of
            regional differences in the level of development? And what
            are the demographic and economic consequences of these
            regional differences in fertility decline? The paper has an
            overview of trends in mortality and migration as well as
            fertility. While one cannot easily disentangle how much of
            the fertility decline resulted from the government's
            family planning efforts and how much was attributable to
            development factors such as increased education,
            urbanization, or to the interaction of the two, one can get
            some impression of the relative importance of overall
            development factors before and after the introduction of the
            family planning program. This analysis shows a strong
            relationship between program input and contraceptive use in
            the post-1970 period even after controlling for level of
            development. In all regions except the North where
            saturation seems to have begun, more health centers per
            capita are associated with higher usage levels and health
            facilities and personnel are the most important variables
            explaining usage levels.
