            Checks and balances in utility regulation -
            the U.K. experience
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the United States the courts have
            long been involved in the oversight of regulators. In the
            United Kingdom, which created its utility regulators from
            scratch in the 1980s, an alternative system was sought. This
            system centers on three concerns: the procedure followed by
            the regulator, the substance of the decisions, and the
            acceptability of the decisions to the public. Three main
            institutions have oversight roles: the Competition
            Commission (formerly the Monopolies and Mergers Commission),
            parliamentary select committees, and the courts. This Note
            reviews the roles of these institutions.
