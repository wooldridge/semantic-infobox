            Transaction costs in private infrastructure
            projects - are they too high?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            While the number of private
            infrastructure projects continues to grow, tales of endless
            delays and exorbitant development costs still scare both
            developers and governments. The authors show that these
            costs are related not to project size but to the
            characteristics of the policy environment. As governments
            gain experience and clarify policy, these costs will
            inevitably fall.
