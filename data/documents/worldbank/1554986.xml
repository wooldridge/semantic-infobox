INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY FOR LATE STARTERS:&#13;
THE EXPERIENCE OF KENYA, TANZANIA AND ZAMBIA&#13;
Based on the existing literature and the circumscribed data base,&#13;
this paper assesses the extent and nature of industrialization in three&#13;
African countries. After a promising start, the drive to industrialize is&#13;
now faltering. The record is influenced much more by the colonial legacy&#13;
and the macro-economic situation of each country than by industrial policy.&#13;
It is clear that future industrial advance will depend heavily on the pace&#13;
of rural development. Catering to world markets is not likely to provide&#13;
a major stimulus for the industrial sector of many African economies in the&#13;
near-term future.&#13;

INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY FOR LATE STARTERS:&#13;
THE EXPERIENCE OF KENYA, TANZANIA AND ZAMBIA&#13;
1.      Countries in Sub-Sahara Africa were among the last of the colonies&#13;
to achieve independence. Their attempts to industrialize have only just&#13;
begun. In fact, most of these economies even today are dominated by agri-&#13;
cultural or mineral production. TIey are the late starters and their in-&#13;
dustrial strategies are influenced by this fact. On the one hand, these&#13;
late starters can benefit from the world's accumulated technology and ex-&#13;
perience regarding industrial organization; on the other hand, the estab-&#13;
lished market positions of earlier industrializers poses special problems&#13;
for the newcomers. Three of these late starters--Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia--&#13;
made a promising beginning during the second half of the 1960s. These&#13;
economies are similar in several respects, but they have pursued strategies&#13;
which diverge in crucial areas. The aim of this paper is threefold:&#13;
- to summarize the record of industrial development of these&#13;
countries during the last decade and a half;&#13;
-  to explain this record in terms of (i) historical factors,&#13;
(ii) macro-economic conditions, and (iii) impact of industrial&#13;
strategies;&#13;
- to examine some of the issues facing these countries as they&#13;
design future industrial policies.&#13;
2.      The title of this paper is somewhat ambiguous and a word of expla-&#13;
nation may help avoid misleading conclusions. We talk about the industrial&#13;
strategy for late starters as a group and in fact, there are some aspects&#13;
of this paper which are relevant in this context. But late starters is a&#13;
large category consisting of countries in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. There&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
are many differences among late starters which have a bearing on strategy&#13;
choices. Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia are by no means representative of the&#13;
late-starter group.&#13;
A. Initial Conditions&#13;
3.      In the mid-sixties, all three economies had rather small populations&#13;
(Table 1) compared to many Third World countries; but they were not atypical,&#13;
in the context of Sub-Sahara Africa 1/. Zambia's per capita income was much&#13;
higher, but its population was much lower than that of Kenya or Tanzania.&#13;
Given the limited market for manufactured goods in these economies, one would not&#13;
expect the manufacturing sector to be large in relation to GDP; in fact, it&#13;
was even smaller than expected. Regression results for 53 countries (linking&#13;
value-added in manufacturing with GNP per capita and population) suggest&#13;
that all three countries had an 'underdeveloped' industrial sector in the&#13;
early 1960s (Chenery 1961). The degree of underdevelopment was less in Kenya&#13;
than in the other two countries 2/.&#13;
4.      We can only speculate as to why the industrial sector in all three&#13;
cases was 'underdeveloped' at the end of the colonial period. The reasons&#13;
for Kenya's favoured position are somewhat clearer. Tanganyika came under&#13;
British control only after World War I having been a German colony for more&#13;
than three decades up to that time. The number of British settlers in&#13;
Tanganyika was much smaller than in Kenya 3/. Because of their size and&#13;
1/ The distribution of 48 countries in Sub-Sahara Africa by population size&#13;
(1977) is as follows: up to 1 million 14; up to 10 million 25; up to 20&#13;
million 5; more than 20 million 4 (World Bank Atlas, 1979).&#13;
2/ Kenya's value-added in manufacturing in 1963 was 45% less than the average&#13;
while Tanzania's shortfall was 80%. In Zambia the shortfall was 50% in&#13;
1964; see Seidman 1972, p. 23; and 1975 p. 360.&#13;
3/ For example, even as late as 1960, only 28% of the people holding long-&#13;
term leases on land in Tanganyika were British--the rest consisted mainly&#13;
of South Africans, Greeks, Asians and Germans (Clark 1978, p. 33).&#13;

cohesion, "British settlers in Kenya were a well established pressure&#13;
group in London" and had considerable influence on colonial policies in-&#13;
directly affecting the development of the manufacturing sector (Rweyemamu&#13;
1973). For example, the colonial Government spent more on the development&#13;
of infrastructure in Kenya than Tanzania--despite the larger geographical&#13;
size and population of the latter. As recently as 1962, per capita aid&#13;
received by Kenya from the U.K. was Sh.21 in comparison with only Sh.9 by&#13;
Tanzania (Clark 1978).  In 1964, Kenya possessed 1,125 illes of bituminized&#13;
roads in comparison with 782 miles in Tanzania. Secondly, there was always&#13;
some uncertainty about Tanganyika's status after it was acquired by Great&#13;
Britain--it had a legal position as a protectorate rather than a colony.&#13;
Because of this, British investment flowed to Kenya rather than Tanganyika&#13;
preferring to serve the latter market from Nairobi. Another important factor&#13;
was that the manufacturing sector during the colonial era was primarily geared&#13;
to the consumption needs of the settler population; the incomes of the African&#13;
population were hardly sufficient for them to constitute a significant market&#13;
for industrial products. Given the sizes of the settler populations in the&#13;
two countries, the market for industry was greater in Kenya and this acted as&#13;
another gravitational force 1/.&#13;
5.      The development of manufacturing in pre-independence Zambia (Northern&#13;
Rhodesia at that time) was also profoundly affected by her relationship with&#13;
Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. British investors were first drawn to the&#13;
latter countries with the discovery of gold and other minerals in the late&#13;
nineteenth century; and a large settler population sprang up in response to&#13;
1/ In 1921, there were 9,651 Europeans in Kenya compared with 2,447 in&#13;
Tanzania. In 1961, the corresponding figures were 59,000 and 23,000&#13;
respectively (Clark 1978, p. 34).&#13;

flourishing economic activity. The prospecting of copper deposits in&#13;
N. Rhodesia began in earnest only in the 1920s. The size and economic&#13;
power of the white settler population in S. Rhodesia and S. Africa gave&#13;
them considerably greater political clout in influencing the decisions and&#13;
policies of the colonial Government. Another economic disincentive for in-&#13;
vestment in landlocked N. Rhodesia was that its lack of access to the sea&#13;
meant that raw materials and other inputs not available locally had to be&#13;
hauled a long way across the land at considerable expense.&#13;
6.      Imports constituted half the total supply of manufactures in Kenya,&#13;
but the proportion was higher in the other two cases (Table 1). A third of&#13;
Kenyan manufactures were exported; the corresponding share was somewhat&#13;
lower in Tanzania and insignificant in Zambia. The bulk of production con-&#13;
sisted of consumer goods in all three cases. The private sector was dominant,&#13;
and large enterprises located in the capital city or the copperbelt (Zambia)&#13;
played a very large role.&#13;
B. Evolution of Industrial Strategies&#13;
7.      In our view industrial strategy must define positions on the following&#13;
issues:&#13;
(a) How much exphasis should be placed on (i) import substitution;&#13;
(ii) exports to world markets; and (iii) exports to markets&#13;
adhering to preferential trade arrangements.&#13;
(b) To what extent should production cater to 'basic needs' of&#13;
the majority of the population, taking account of their life-&#13;
style and purchasing power as against responding to the effective&#13;
demand of the modernized minority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
(c) How much emphasis should be placed on the development of those&#13;
key lines of production (e.g. steel, machinery, etc.) which&#13;
are believed to be essential for self-reliance and also a rich&#13;
source of external economies.&#13;
(d) What emphasis should be placed on equality in spatial distri-&#13;
bution of firms and on promoting enterprises of small size.&#13;
(e) What should be the role of (i) the public or parastatal sector;&#13;
(ii) the private sector; and (iii) foreign capital in invest-&#13;
ment and production.&#13;
(f) To what extent should use be made of administrative controls and&#13;
licensing as against policies using price instrumerts (e.g. taxes,&#13;
tariffs, etc.)&#13;
8.      Issues (a) through (d) are concerned with ends, i.e., rate and pattern&#13;
of industrialization while (e) and (f) focus on means, i.e., the manner in&#13;
which aims should be pursued. Policies bearing on infrastructure, financial&#13;
intermediation, training and entrepreneurship are also important for industrial&#13;
development, particularly in the category of late starters, but in this paper&#13;
we do not discuss them. Technology policy is also not treated explicitly, but&#13;
item (d) on the size structure of firms touches on this aspect.&#13;
9.      The broad contours of industrial strategy in the wake of independence&#13;
were remarkably similar in the three economies. The First Development Plan&#13;
of Kenya (1966-70), the Zambian White Paper on Industrial Policy issued in&#13;
1964 and Tanzania's First Plan (1964-69) shared a common view of how to go&#13;
about industrializing. All three countries opted for the capitalistic road.&#13;
All three recognized the dearth of indigenous entrepreneurship as the critical&#13;
impediment and put heavy reliance on foreign private parties to supply not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
only capital but also technology and management. There was scarcely any&#13;
break with the colonial period. The strategy was essentially to carry on&#13;
as before. Little attention was given to issues (b) and (c). The desira-&#13;
bility of promoting industry outside Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and the copper-&#13;
belt in Zambia was mentioned halfheartedly.   Very little was said about&#13;
the size structure of enterprises.&#13;
10.     As far as issue (a) is concerned, the emphasis was clearly on import&#13;
substitution. Competing in world markets was considered to be beyond the&#13;
range of feasibility but there was considerable interest in regional markets.&#13;
Kenya and Tanzania had free trade behind a common external tariff since 1927.&#13;
These arrangements, initiated during the colonial period, had engendered&#13;
much controversy. An official report written in 1932 recommended that&#13;
t"Tanganyika should . . . cease to deplete her revenue and impoverish her&#13;
citizens by protecting the products of her neighbors"l/ (i.e., Kenya). With&#13;
independence, the new Tanzanian authorities could have withdrawn from the&#13;
East African arrangements but decided not to do so. Instead, they negotiated&#13;
substantial alterations in these regional arrangements with the hope that&#13;
Tanzania would secure a fairer share of benefits than had accrued to her up&#13;
to that time. All the details of these alterations reflected in the Raisman&#13;
Report, the Kampala Agreement and the 1967 Treaty are not relevant for this&#13;
paper but the following aspects are important for a discussion of industrial&#13;
strategy:&#13;
- A modest scheme for fiscal redistribution to compensate for inequali-&#13;
ties in the benefits of the Common Market was put into effect in&#13;
1961/62 and lasted till 1969.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
- Tanzania threatened to withdraw from the Common Market unless&#13;
measures were taken to correct the imbalance in industrial invest-&#13;
ment. An ad hoc allocation of some industries was made in 1964;&#13;
electric light bulbs to Kenya, radios, motor tires and tubes,&#13;
aluminum foil, circles and plain sheets to Tanzania. It was pro-&#13;
posed that studies should be made to (i) identify industries whose&#13;
viability required markets larger than that of any one member;&#13;
(ii) determine the appropriate location of these industries in East&#13;
Africa. A number of studies were undertaken, but the ad hoc allocation&#13;
was never ratified by all parties.&#13;
- The East African Development Bank was established in 1969 to pro-&#13;
mote industrial development with special emphasis on relatively&#13;
backward partner states. Its investments were to go to Tanzania&#13;
(39%), Uganda (39%) and Kenya (22%).&#13;
- Tanzania was authorized in 1967 to levy transfer taxes of up to 50%&#13;
of the common external tariff for a period of eight years on products&#13;
where it had capacity of its own.&#13;
11.     The similarity of industrial strategies in the three countries ended&#13;
in 1967 with the Arusha Declaration. This was part of a major transformation&#13;
in the overall Tanz nian strategy of socio-economic development. The capitalis-&#13;
tic road based on foreign capital was abandoned in favor of socialism and&#13;
self-reliance. In the industrial sphere, there was a significant shift in&#13;
position on almost all the issues listed in paragraph 7. We have already&#13;
noted the changed posture vis-a-vis the East African Common Market. Transfer&#13;
taxes were levied on 50 items imported from Kenya. The Second Plan (1969-74)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
opted for a 'basic goods' strategy and this was further elaborated in the&#13;
next plan. By 1996, the share of intermediate and capital goods was to be&#13;
raised to 60%. Emphasis was to be placed on meeting the essential needs&#13;
of the Tanzanian people through d7mestic resources. Special attention&#13;
was to be given to the processing of local raw materials, e.g. cotton,&#13;
hides and skins, sisal and cashews for the home and foreign markets.&#13;
12.     The Arusha wind blew in Mulungushi in 1968 where Dr. Kaunda an-&#13;
nounced a series of nationalizations and other reforms to implement Zambia's&#13;
humanist philosophy. Here too the capitalist solution was rejected and the&#13;
goal of self-reliance proclaimed. The Second Zambian Plan (1972-76) visuali-&#13;
zed a rate of growth of value-added in manufacturing of 15% p.a. Its main&#13;
emphasis was on import substitution. Major expansion of meat processing,&#13;
dairy products and textile capacity was visualized. In addition, there was&#13;
the intention to produce sulphuric acid for the mining industry and fertili-&#13;
ser for farming. The aim of promoting small enterprises in rural areas was&#13;
given considerable prominence,and it was believed that the opening up of the&#13;
Tanzam railroad would generate many opportunities of this kind. The Third&#13;
Zambian Plan (1979-83) did not represent much change in strategy, although&#13;
the overall target for expansion of the sector was reduced to 8% p.a. There&#13;
was more emphasis placed on exploiting local materials for both import sub-&#13;
stitution and exports. Also, the Third Plan was critical of excessive capital&#13;
intensity and insisted on the need to fabricate animal-drawn implements, hand&#13;
tools and simple machines for the farm sector.&#13;
13.     While Tanzania and Zambia opted for the socialist path, Kenya con-&#13;
tinued to rely on private initiative, including private foreign investment.&#13;
The long-term goal was 'localization of capitalism'. The Second Plan talked&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
about "...an active and growing participation of Kenyan citizens in manage-&#13;
ment and ownership of industry". At one level, localization was promoted&#13;
through (i) the refusal to give citizenship to alien minorities; (ii) the&#13;
requirement that non-citizens obtain work permits; and (iii) the imposition&#13;
of restrictions on foreign business in such areas as domestic trade (Ghai&#13;
1973). Nevertheless, the open door policy for large foreign investors in&#13;
manufacturing continued intact.&#13;
14.     Kenya's Fourth Plan (1979-83), formulated against the background of&#13;
the death of the East African Common Market in 1977, shifted the emphasis of&#13;
industrial strategy from production for the home and regional markets to a&#13;
search for international markets. To prepare for the new phase, measures&#13;
to rationalize industry and increase competitiveness are visualized. There&#13;
is also a stronger emphasis than before on the promotion of small enterprises&#13;
and the informal sector.&#13;
15.     We will show in the next section that these strategies have left&#13;
their mark on industrialization in the three countries. Of course, the pace&#13;
of growth and structural change was also influenced heavily by longer-term&#13;
historical factors and macro-economic developments during the past decade.&#13;
C. Growth in the Manufacturing Sector&#13;
16.     The manufacturing sector expanded'more rapidly in Kenya than in the&#13;
other two countries over the period as a whole.(Figure 1-4 and Table 2).&#13;
Up to the early 1970s, Zambia was leading the field but suffered a major&#13;
setback; subsequently, output has been falling since 1974. The share of&#13;
manufacturing in GDP climbed up from 6.8% in 1965 to 11.9% in 1973 but then&#13;
dropped to 10.4% by 1977 (Annex Table 1). In Tanzania too, manufacturing&#13;
output rose very rapidly in the initial period but slowed down after 1972.&#13;
Kenya manufacturing output fell in 1975 then recovered briskly.&#13;

17.     Kenya's lead in the manufacturing field was already firmly established&#13;
during the colonial period and the last 10-15 years have added to it. Efforts&#13;
made by the other two countries to catch up have not yet borne fruit. There&#13;
are three main reasons for this outcome. First, GDP growth has been faster&#13;
in Kenya, thereby expanding the home market for manufactures and facilitating&#13;
raw material supplies from the farm sector. Secondly, we have already noted&#13;
that the policy frame for the manufacturing sector has been much more stable&#13;
than in neighboring countries. To some extent, therefore, faster growth has&#13;
been obtained by postponing structural and institutional changes. Finally,&#13;
Kenya has long been a familiar country to foreigners and Nairobi's infra-&#13;
structure is far superior to that of the other two countries. Accordingly,&#13;
Kenyan industrial growth was aided by. the flow of foreign direct investment&#13;
to a much larger extent than in the other two cases.&#13;
18.     Relative to growth of GDP, manufacturing has increased most rapidly&#13;
in Zambia, taking account of the entire period under review. Table 2 shows&#13;
that the Zambian elasticity coefficient was almost 1.8, i.e., manufacturing&#13;
value-added rose by 1.8% for each 1.0% rise in GDP. During 1964-73, the&#13;
corresponding coefficient was 2.4, reflecting the rapidity of import sub-&#13;
stitution in manufacturing.&#13;
D. Scale and Pattern of Import Substitution&#13;
19.     Import substitution was a major impetus behind Zambian industriali-&#13;
zation; exports were unimportant and domestic demand rose at a much slower&#13;
pace than in the other two countries. This is one of the conclusions of&#13;
a statistical disaggregation of the sources of industrial growth we have&#13;
carried out (Table 3). The lack of recent censuses of industry or input-&#13;
output tables restricts the period over which this exercise can be carried&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
out but we have reason to believe that many of the conclusions apply over&#13;
the entire period we are studying (Annex Note A). Import substitution&#13;
accounts for 55% of the overall rise in Zambia's manufacturing output&#13;
during 1965-72. A sharp expansion in the textile, clothing and leather&#13;
industry reduced the share of imports in total supply of these items from&#13;
77% to 46% during this period (see Annex Table 5). Corresponding ratios&#13;
for rubber, chemicals and petroleum products also declined very sharply.&#13;
The import substitution drive was part of Zambia's search for self-reliance.&#13;
In addition, it was spurred on by the rupture of her relationship with&#13;
Southern Rhodesia in the wake of the latter's Unilateral Declaration of&#13;
Independence. S. Rhodesia had been the customary source of manufactured&#13;
consumer and light intermediate goods, but this stopped when Zambia imposed&#13;
economic sanctions and closed the border in 1965.&#13;
20.     Import substitution was a considerably smaller source of industrial&#13;
growth in Kenya, with domestic demand and exports playing a larger role than&#13;
in Zambia (Table 3). The share of imports in total supply of finished tex-&#13;
tiles, clothing, beverages, tobacco and non-metallic mineral products dropped&#13;
in Kenya; but this was offset to some extent by a heavier reliance on imports&#13;
of food products, semi-processed textiles, footwear and wood (Annex Table 3).&#13;
21.     The most surprising finding was that import substitution played no&#13;
role whatever in overall expansion in Tanzanian manufacturing. This was so&#13;
despite the emphasis on self-reliance in several strategy pronouncements.&#13;
There was considerable import replacement of beverages, textiles, wearing&#13;
apparel and non-metallic mineral products; but this was offset by increased&#13;
reliance on imports of food products, wood products, furniture and fixtures,&#13;
capital goods, metals and metal products (Annex Table 4). The import/supply&#13;

ratio for capital goods, metals and metal products in 1965 was 80%, compared&#13;
to 41% for consumer goods. The share of imported capital goods, metal and&#13;
metal products in total supply rose by 0.7% during 1965-72. This seemingly&#13;
small rise from a very high initial level was enough to swamp the impact of&#13;
import substitution in several consumer products.&#13;
22.     So far we have examined import substitution in the form of expansion&#13;
in the share of locally produced manufactured goods in total supply of such&#13;
goods. Now we will look at another dimension, i.e., the dependence of loc.al&#13;
manufacturing output on imported raw materials and semi-processed inputs.&#13;
Again, Zambia scored the sharpest decline in such import dependence from 26%&#13;
in 1964 to 18% in 1969 1/ (Table 3). Import coefficients declined and there-&#13;
fore local value-added rose markedly as a proportion of gross output in&#13;
beverages, tobacco, textiles, wood, non-metallic mineral products and fabri-&#13;
cated metal industries (Annex Table 8). Although data are not beyond reproach,&#13;
there seems to have taken place a measure of deepening in these branches;&#13;
they ceased to be pure assembly, finishing and mixing enterprises by acquir-&#13;
ing some capacity to process materials.&#13;
23.     By way of contrast, the import coefficient in Tanzanian manufacturing&#13;
only fell by 2% during roughly the same period (Annex Table 7). There was a&#13;
large drop in many branches producing consumer goods, e.g. food, beverages,&#13;
tobacco and textiles; but the coefficient rose sharply in several industries&#13;
producing intermediate and capital goods. This increase partly reflected&#13;
changes in the output-mix, but it was also influenced by the manner in which&#13;
Tanzanian parastatals established new types of production. Clark (1978)&#13;
1/ These results are based on comparing input-output tables for 1964 and&#13;
1969. The table for 1967 shows a very different picture. See Annex&#13;

cites examples of the fertilizer plant based on imported materials instead&#13;
of local phosphates and the tire factory based on imported synthetic rubber&#13;
instead of locally grown natural rubber.&#13;
24.     While the import coefficient fell sharply in Zambia and marginally&#13;
in Tanzania, there was a large upsurge in the dependence of imports of Kenyan&#13;
manufacturing. The coefficient of imported inputs rose by a full ten per-&#13;
centage points and its absolute level at 30% in 1970 exceeded by far the&#13;
corresponding proportion in neighboring countries. Food, textile raw&#13;
materials, wood, rubber, chemicals, non-metallic minerals experienced large&#13;
upward shifts in import dependence (Annex Table 6). Only beverages, tobacco,&#13;
textile finishing, clothing, footwear and fabricated metal branches secured&#13;
a reduction.&#13;
25.     Import dependence was high in Kenya partly because the output-mix&#13;
of the manufacturing sector there was much more diversified than in Tanzania&#13;
and Zambia. The share of capital and intermediate goods in total Kenyan&#13;
manufacturing output was higher, and these branches tend to have a larger&#13;
import coefficient. If the Tanzanian manufacturing sector had Kenya's output-&#13;
mix, then its overall import coefficient would be 18% in 1970 instead of the&#13;
actual 14%. Another factor which may be responsible for Kenya's high import&#13;
dependence is the fact that a large part of its industry is controlled by&#13;
transnational corporations. These firms frequently preferred foreign inputs&#13;
to local ones on the grounds that the former were more compatible with the&#13;
technological process in use and their supply was more dependable.&#13;
E. Behavior of Manufactured Exports&#13;
26.     Exports were a significant part of manufacturing production in Kenya&#13;
and Tanzania, and the regional East African Common Market (EACM) accounted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
for a substantial part of overseas sales (Table 4). Unfortunately, the Comidon&#13;
Market failed to expand rapidly and collapsed in 1977. Exports to inter-&#13;
national markets increased more rapidly--especially in the case of Kenya.&#13;
But, altogether, the export orientation of the manufacturing sector in these&#13;
two countries diminished. Zambia's manufacturing continued to ignore export&#13;
sales.&#13;
27.     A number of Kenyan industrial branches were exporting more than&#13;
half their output in the early 1960s; this was the case in meat and dairy&#13;
products, canned fruits and vegetables, fabrics, footwear, wood, leather,&#13;
petroleum, chemicals, and cement (Annex Table 9). More than 50% of overseas&#13;
sales of processed tobacco, petroleum, chemicals, basic manufactures, batteries&#13;
and insulated wire were destined for the EACM (Annex Table 10). Transfer&#13;
taxes had been imposed on many of these items in 1967 by Kenya's trading&#13;
partners and behind these protective barriers, Tanzanian and Ugandan firms&#13;
were growing up and gaining experience. By 1976, Kenya had lost her East&#13;
African market for processed food, beverages and tobacco and many types of&#13;
miscellaneous manufactures. Sales of basic manufactures had risen slowly.&#13;
By contrast, Kenyan exports of petroleum and chemicals expanded rapidly and&#13;
insulation wire and batteries became a prominent new line of business. Al-&#13;
together total sales to EACM doubled during 1965-76; an annual growth rate&#13;
of 2.3% (Table 4).&#13;
28.     Kenya succeeded in entering many new markets in U.K., Western Europe&#13;
and in African countries such as Zambia, Sudan, Rwanda and Mauritius. Her&#13;
manufactured exports to non-EACM markets rose from $35 million to $219 million&#13;
during 1965-76; an annual growth rate of 16% (Table 4). Sales to African&#13;
countries (outside EACM) expanded by a factor of nine. These achievements&#13;

notwithstanding, Kenya still depended on EACM for about one-third of her&#13;
exports of manufactures, on the eve of the breakdown of these regional&#13;
trade arrangements.&#13;
29.     Tanzania was determined to catch up with Kenya and reduce the trade&#13;
deficit she had vis-a-vis the EACM. It was to achieve this outcome that the&#13;
1967 Treaty had visualized transfer taxes. In fact, Tanzania's trade deficit&#13;
continued to rise up to 1976, although her exports to the EACM increased by&#13;
125% during 1967-76 (Annex Table 12).&#13;
30.     In 1965 Tanzania's exports to EACM consisted largely of edible oil,&#13;
made-up textiles, apparel goods and aluminum and metal products (Annex Table 11).&#13;
Sales of the first two items diminished greatly during 1965-73, and the increase&#13;
in the third item was not very large. However, a number of new products-&#13;
ginned cotton, leather products, paints, soaps, rubber tires and tubes, ferti-&#13;
lizers, radios and batteries--had acquired some prominence in this trade.&#13;
While the emergence of new items was a dynamic element, the total value of&#13;
Tanzanian exports of manufactures to the EACM was growing very slowly at an&#13;
annual rate of 1.6% during 1965-77. During the same period, expansion of&#13;
exports of manufactures to non-EACM markets was much more rapid-7.6% p.a.--&#13;
though even this growth was only half that of Kenya.&#13;
31.     We cannot take comfort from this review of the behavior of manufactured&#13;
exports. Many factors are responsible for the reduction in export orientation,&#13;
and we cannot do justice to all of them in this article. The break-up of the&#13;
Common Market has clouded the prospect for industrialization in Eastern Africa.&#13;
Secondly, there is the whole question of financial incentives which are heavily&#13;
biased in favor of production for the home market in all three countries (Phelps&#13;
and Wasow, undated; Acharya 1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
Finally, there are serious physical constraints on production and exports&#13;
in a number of cases. We will return to some of these issues in the last&#13;
section of this article.&#13;
F. Institutional Differentiation&#13;
32.     Starting in 1967, Zambia and Tanzania followed the socialist path&#13;
while Kenya continued to rely on the private sector. Foreign investment&#13;
accounted for 42% of total capital formation in the Kenya manufacturing&#13;
sector in 1968 (Needleman 1970). Foreign firms contributed 57% to gross&#13;
manufacturing butput at about that time. We do not have any recent data,&#13;
but there is reason to believe that foreign investment continues to play a&#13;
very important role in Kenya.&#13;
33.     It is unfortunate that there has been little analytical research&#13;
on the operation of foreign-owned firms and their impact on Kenyan industrial&#13;
development. Lall and Streeten (1977) examined a sample of eight foreign&#13;
firms in Kenya in the mid-sixties (that accounted for about 18% of output and&#13;
8% of employment in manufacturing in 1966). They found that net capital inflows&#13;
(equity, long-term loans and retained earnings out of foreign profits) of these&#13;
firms amounted to 12.5% of sales. But, the cost of servicing this foreign&#13;
capital (profits, interest and royalties) was significantly larger (17.2% of&#13;
sales). A proper assessment of the social contribution of foreign investment&#13;
requires a careful cost-benefit analysis. Lall and Streeten estimate social&#13;
profitability (social benefits minus costs computed on the basis of shadow&#13;
prices) to be 12.7Z of sales indicating that the operation of these foreign&#13;
firms was socially profitable.&#13;
34.     The role of parastatals had risen rapidly after 1967 in Zambia&#13;
and Tanzania (Table 5). They accounted for 40-50Z of employment and output&#13;
&#13;

in the manufacturing sector. The question of how these parastatals have&#13;
performed has aroused some controversy. Official Tanzanian data suggest&#13;
that while employment and the capital stock in parastatals rose by seven&#13;
times during 1966-67 to 1972-73, value added in these firms expanded by&#13;
less than five times 1/. Consequently, the incremental capital-output&#13;
ratio rose from 2.5 in the late 1960s to about 5.6 in the mid-1970s, and&#13;
output per worker fell by roughly 30%.&#13;
35.     Prima facie, these data are worrying but it is not easy to arrive&#13;
at definitive conclusions. First, these data apply to a total of 13-16 firms&#13;
at the beginning of the period and about 47 firms at the end. The apparent&#13;
deterioration in the productivity of capital and labour may not be significant;&#13;
the change in the ratios may reflect differences in the output mix rather&#13;
than a decline in the operational efficiency of individual enterprises.&#13;
Secondly, as argued in the ILO Report (1978), it would indeed be surprising&#13;
if efficiency of Tanzanian parastatals did not decline in the aftermath of&#13;
major institutional changes and indigenisation of managerial and professional&#13;
posts. The crucial issue is whether or not this fall in efficiency is per-&#13;
manent. Many of the impediments to efficiency appear to be of a transitional&#13;
nature. For example, some parastatal managers are recent graduates with&#13;
little relevant experiencd; they will learn on the job as they carry out&#13;
their new responsibilities. Another example of frictional difficulties is&#13;
provided by the control system applicable to parastatal enterprises. Apparently,&#13;
this system has seven layers, i.e., (i) manager; (ii) board of directors of&#13;
firm; (iii) holding corporation; (iv) board of directors of holding corporation;&#13;

(v) parent ministry; vi) ministry of finance and planning; (vii) cabinet&#13;
and parliament. The roles of these controllers are not very well specified&#13;
on paper, and there is much duplication in practice. It may take time to&#13;
iron out these anomalies and rationalise the organizational framework. Thirdly,&#13;
some of the problems of parastatals apply almost equally to firms in the&#13;
private sector. A good example would be the scarcity of foreign exchange&#13;
leading to the imposition of controls and a cumbersome administration of&#13;
import licensing in both Tanzania and Zambia. Firms in both these countries&#13;
are also affected by shortages of locally produced agricultural raw materials.&#13;
36.     We have not been able to review all important aspects of industrial&#13;
development. Little has been said regarding the size structure or location&#13;
of industrial enterprises, for example. Whatever information is available&#13;
suggest that the limited role of small enterprises (those employing less&#13;
than 20 to 25 workers) in the 1960s has contracted even further during the&#13;
past decade in all three countries (Annex Table 14). The locational pattern&#13;
has not changed much either; the bulk of manufacturing activity is still&#13;
clustered around Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and the copperbelt in Zambia (Annex&#13;
Table 15).&#13;
37.     On aspects of industrial change that we have examined, our findings&#13;
are vulnerable to the usual pitfalls of analysis based on weak data. Major&#13;
conclusions are not in doubt, however. All three countries made a promising&#13;
start in industrial development during the 1960s, but the pace of progress&#13;
could not be sustained in Zambia or Tanzania; even in Kenya the prospect for&#13;
further growth was clouded among other factors by the failure of the East&#13;
African Common Market. Industrial strategies pursued by the three countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
influenced the rate and pattern of change only to a limited extent. For&#13;
example, while state ownership and control expanded dramatically in Tanzania&#13;
and Zambia, in response to major shifts in strategy; there must be disappoint-&#13;
ment regarding the extent to which basic goals sought through the instrumen-&#13;
tality of parastatals have been achieved so far. Another instructive example&#13;
is provided by Zambian experience regarding import substitution. A substanitial&#13;
measure of import replacement did take place as visualised by strategy, but a&#13;
major impetus came from the closure of the border with Southern Rhodesia&#13;
dictated by political considerations which were largely exogenous to the design&#13;
of industrial strategy.&#13;
G. Some Strategie Issues&#13;
38.     In the long run, industrialization will play a vital role in&#13;
Africa as elsewhere. When and how this will happen is not easy to predict.&#13;
Our focus here is on near-term issues of strategy over the next decade or&#13;
two, against the background of what took place in the 1970s. The last&#13;
decade saw a major slowing down in the rate of growth of real GDP, agri-&#13;
cultural production and exports in Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia and, more&#13;
broadly,in most countries in Sub-Sahara Africa (Gulhati 1980). Acute&#13;
financial pressures on the balance of payments and the budget accompanied&#13;
this slowing down. These adverse trends were caused by:&#13;
(i) unfavourable international economic conditions, including&#13;
a sizeable deterioration in terms of trade;&#13;
(ii) internal shocks such as droughts and widespread political&#13;
and civil conflict and,&#13;
(iii) policy failures, e.g. massive increase in the responsibilities&#13;
of the public sector in the face of acute scarcity of skilled&#13;
managers, administrators and technicians leading to gross&#13;
inefficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
39.     The key question of near-term strategy in this context is how to&#13;
reduce financial pressures through a suitable combination of demand&#13;
management and augmentation of supply. Here, we will focus on the latter,&#13;
particularly,in relation to the manufacturing sector. Three issues deserve&#13;
consideration. First, what is the scope for expanding sales of manufactures&#13;
in world markets? Secondly, what are the prospects for organizing import&#13;
substitution on a sub-regional or regional basis so as to escape from the&#13;
predicament of limited national markets for manufactures? Finally, what&#13;
policy measures are necessary for strengthening linkages between industry&#13;
and the rest of the national economy? These issues are not mutually ex-&#13;
clusive; strengthening linkages within the national economy and promoting&#13;
intra-trade within Africa are worthwhile objectives even if there is plenty&#13;
of scope for industry to serve global markets. But it is true that the&#13;
third issue becomes crucial, if serving nearby and distant overseas mar-&#13;
kets is judged to be problematical.&#13;
40.     The world market for manufactures expanded very rapidly and LDC&#13;
exports of manufactures rose at 12% per annum in 1960-1977. Since then&#13;
some sloaing down has already occurred, and it is expected that growth will&#13;
slow down to about 10% per annum during 1977-1990 (World Development&#13;
Report, 1980). So far the list of LDCs who have succeeded in getting a firm&#13;
foothold in the world market consists of a relatively small group of Asian,&#13;
Latin American and Southern European nations. Except for India they are&#13;
all middle-income countries with substantial experience in manufacturing and&#13;
marketing. They have shown remarkable agility in shifting product lines&#13;
and markets whenever protectionist policies in North America or Europe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
have impeded access. The story was very different for Sub-Sahara Africa.&#13;
Manufactured exports from this region rose by less than 5% per year and theit&#13;
share in the total from LDCs dropped from 5% to 2% during 1965-76 (Keesing&#13;
1979).&#13;
41.     Expansion of exports in the near-term is essential for African&#13;
countries. In principle, they could secure such an increase throu!ah:&#13;
(i) primary commodities:&#13;
(ii) processed agricultural or mineral items;&#13;
(iii) labour-intensive manufactures;&#13;
(iv) skill-intensive manufactures; and&#13;
(v) capital-intensive manufactures.&#13;
Most of African exports are primary commodities,and there is no question&#13;
that these countries have a strong comparative advantage in this area.&#13;
The decline or slowdown in the rate of increase in the volume of primary&#13;
exports that took place in the 1970s can be reversed through appropriate&#13;
policy and institutional changes.&#13;
42.     It has also been suggested that the comparative advantage of African&#13;
economies lies in the processing of natural resource-based commodities.&#13;
For example, Zambia exports its copper in refined form, thereby adding value&#13;
to the mined ore. It does not convert refined copper into fabricated products&#13;
(e.g. wires, tubes and pipes), however. Coffee from Kenya and Tanzania is&#13;
exported in green or roasted form but not as essences or extracts. The&#13;
economics of successive stages of processing varies greatly by commodity,&#13;
and few generalizations are safe. Many resource-based activities are very&#13;
demanding of skills, capital or energy. Many are subject to sizeable&#13;
economies of scale. Some are subject to the monopolistic or oligopolistic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
control of trans-national corporations. Tariff rates in OECD markets&#13;
tend to rise with the extent of processing,and shipping freight rates are&#13;
frequently biased in favour of primary commodities (World Development&#13;
Report, 1980). On this basis we have to conclude that while there may be&#13;
profitable opportunities for expanding exports of processed items in indi-&#13;
vidual countries or specific commodity chains, there is not a general pre-&#13;
sumption that this is the favoured route to travel for Africa during the next&#13;
decade or two.&#13;
43.     Many present-day LDC exporters of manufactures broke into global&#13;
markets by exploiting their comparative advantage in labour-intensive&#13;
items, given their relatively low level of wages. But African economies&#13;
tend to have high rates of compensation for factory labour while worker&#13;
productivity remains at a very low level.&#13;

Note: The underlying data,drawn from periodic national surveys&#13;
are average monthly earnings of all workers in establishments&#13;

time payments, bonuses, allowances but exclude compensation&#13;
in kind. Comparisons are based on official exchange rates in&#13;
mid-seventies. Indices capture real wage changes over a&#13;
ten-year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
Zambian wages, for example, are much higher than in Kenya and Tanzania and&#13;
wages in all three Eastern African countries are substantially higher than&#13;
in India or Philippines.(See Table 6.) The level of African wages reflects&#13;
the high reservation price of labour, the legacy of the colonial period,&#13;
and the adoption of minimum wage legislation in some cases (Acharya 1981).&#13;
In Kenya, the Government has recognized the need to realign the wage level&#13;
and some decline has occurred already. To acquire competitiveness in world&#13;
markets for labour-intensive manufactures, it will be necessary to&#13;
sustain this trend through a combination of exchange rate and income&#13;
policy. The high growth rate of the population and labour force in&#13;
Africa (expected during the 1980s and 1990s) should be allowed to have&#13;
a downward impact on the relative price of labour in the modern factory&#13;
sector, thereby reducing urban-rural income differentials and raising the&#13;
competitiveness of the manufacturing sector.&#13;
44.       Nobody claims that African countries have a comparative ad-&#13;
vantage in skill and/or capital-intensive manufactures at this stage of&#13;
their development. There exists a chronic shortage of skills which&#13;
pervades not only the small manufacturing sector but the entire economy&#13;
and the over-loaded government machine. The hiring of skilled personnel&#13;
abroad to cope with these shortages is extremely expensive. As indigenous&#13;
expertise expands it will have to be allocated to priority sectors, e.g.&#13;
government economic management and policy formulation, infrastructure&#13;
and agriculture. A way out in the manufacturing sector is to rely on&#13;
the managerial, financial and marketing skills of trans-national corpora-&#13;
tions (TNCs) who operate a world-wide network. It may suit these TNCs&#13;
to produce parts of products or whole products in Africa for sale in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
nearby markets or for reimport into their home country. The problem&#13;
with this option is that it perpetuates the dependence of African&#13;
economies on TNCs for markets, technology and entrepreneurship. While&#13;
it may be possible to secure a high rate of growth of manufacturing pro-&#13;
duction and exports under these arrangements, the costs of foreign&#13;
collaboration may also be considerable (Tinbergen 1977). Small economies&#13;
in Africa are unlikely to possess the information and the bargaining&#13;
strength necessary to strike equitable deals with TNCs. Some countries&#13;
will find congenial a strategy which gears industrial development to&#13;
world markets through TNCs. In other countries the commitment to socialism&#13;
rules out a significant role for private foreign investment;and the prospects&#13;
for expansion of manufactured exports in lines requiring economies of scale,&#13;
changing production technologies, brand-names, after-sales service networks&#13;
and supplier's credit are dampened.&#13;
45.     Altogether, our conclusion is that sales tc world markets are&#13;
not likely to become the engine of industrial growth in many African&#13;
countries in the near-term future. There will be exceptions, of course,&#13;
and we hope there are more than we can confidently predict at this time.&#13;
These qualifications, notwithstanding, the bias against exports that now&#13;
pervades the incentive systems of African economies ought to be removed.&#13;
In fact, governments should adopt a strong promotional posture, given the&#13;
key role that manufactured exports play in assimilating technological&#13;
change and in breaking the barrier imposed by small domestic markets.&#13;
46.    A way out of the small-size dilemma for African economies is to pool&#13;
their national markets together into a regional or sub-regional common&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
market. The idea is not new, of course. The accent of the Lagos Plan 1/,&#13;
recently adopted by African Heads of State, is on collective self-reliance.&#13;
The aim is to move towards an Africa-wide economic community by the year&#13;
2000. We have seen how this approach was tried in Eastern Africa, and how&#13;
it led to an impasse in 1977. It would be wrong to conclude from this&#13;
history that the idea of a regional approach is altogether bankrupt. We&#13;
do not believe that difficulties in re-establishing and maintaining similar&#13;
institutional arrangements are insurmountable. Many valuable lessons can&#13;
be learned from the history of EACM and similar experiments in Latin America.&#13;
It is already clear that a key problem is that the net benefits of regional&#13;
cooperation in the industrial sphere tend to accrue in large measure to&#13;
countries which are relatively advanced. It follows that a customs union&#13;
approach to regional cooperation by itself will not suffice, if participating&#13;
countries are at different points on the development scale. Industrial&#13;
planning on a regional level and/or some mechanism for the redistri-&#13;
bution of benefits among member countries is essential. Research on&#13;
alternative designs of regional collaboration in industrial production or&#13;
trade can have a high payoff. There is the need for creating the political&#13;
consensus among collaborating governments without which these arrangements&#13;
cannot flourish. It should not be beyond the ingenuity of African statesmen&#13;
to demonstrate the feasibility of collective self-reliance in the sphere&#13;
of industry.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
47.     Many observers are deeply sceptical and we admit that past history&#13;
is far from reassuring. The pessimists point to the political fragmentation&#13;
and the frequency as well as intensity of military and other conflict among&#13;
African states. They also draw attention to the fact that even if the presence&#13;
of political will is assumed, customs unions, common markets and economic&#13;
communities require a substantial amount of professional and managerial skill&#13;
to function effectively. Such talent is very scarce in most African coun-&#13;
tries today. It may be unrealistic, therefore, to count on rapid progress&#13;
towards an African economic community. If an attempt is made, nevertheless,&#13;
to force the pace of progress by creating the administrative infrastructure&#13;
(new sub-regional and regional organizations) for such an arrangement,&#13;
the result may simply be to accentuate the acute shortage of key personnel&#13;
that is manifest all over Africa in existing government bodies.&#13;
48.     Perhaps, a more fruitful course of action at this stage of economic&#13;
development would be to consider ways of strengthening linkages between&#13;
itidustry and the rest of the national economy. Industrial strategy in&#13;
Africa must be closely tied to the mainspring of rural development and&#13;
agricultural growth. Although industry and agriculture compete for funds&#13;
and scarce skilled manpower, the two sectors are complementary in large mea-&#13;
sure. Industry relies on farm production for local raw materials, food for&#13;
its workers and foreign exchange to purchase capital goods or other imported&#13;
inputs. Farmers are, or can become, the major market outlet for manufactured&#13;
output of consumer goods, farm implements and other inputs. Given these&#13;
close connections, it is virtually futile to aim at rapid industrialization&#13;
in Africa except in the context of progressive rural development. The&#13;
history of the post-independence period confirms this proposition. An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
attempt was made to industrialise rapidly at the expense of agriculture and&#13;
it failed.   Agriculture contributes 30-40% of overall GDP in Tanzania and&#13;
Kenya; its share is much less in Zambia, but only because of the serious&#13;
neglect of this sector. In addition to its direct contribution, agriculture&#13;
is also the basis of much non-farm economic activity in rural areas and small&#13;
towns (Anderson and Leiserson, 1978). Given its direct and indirect impor-&#13;
tance for the home market for manufactures, industrial strategy should eschew&#13;
tax, tariff or exchange rate measures which undermine the profitability of&#13;
agriculture. In addition, there is need to strengthen linkages between the&#13;
two sectors.&#13;
49.     An important potential linkage in the African context is that&#13;
between raw materials (of mineral or agricultural origin) and the manu-&#13;
facturing sector. This has been discussed above. Another linkage which&#13;
can be of growing significance concerns tools and implements manufactured&#13;
locally for use in the agricultural sector. Today, this link is almost&#13;
non-existent, partly because agriculture generally employs a traditional&#13;
technology which makes hardly any use of equipment and partly because in the&#13;
small pockets where mechanisation has been introduced, the imported tractor&#13;
is prominent. The bush fallow system of cultivation, practiced widely in&#13;
East Africa, uses: a small axe and/or a large knife (machete) for clearing&#13;
fields of trees and bushes, a hand hoe (jembe) for soil cultivation, a&#13;
small knife for harvesting and often a flat wooden paddle for threshing.&#13;
Ox-plowing has not been adopted widely;  e.g., in Kenya only 200,000 ha.&#13;
are plowed in this manner, compared to a million ha. by hand. Average&#13;
annual imports of hand tools during the mid-seventies amounted to $4 million&#13;
in Taniania (equal to 0.7% of the gross value of manufacturing output) and&#13;
&#13;

$1 million each in Kenya and Zambia (0.1% and 0.3% of mfg output&#13;
respectively). Agricultural machinery imports amounted to $17 million&#13;
per year in Kenya and $10 million each in Zambia and Tanzania. Tractors&#13;
comprised 75% of total machinery imports in Zambia and about 66% in Kenya&#13;
and Tanzania 1/.&#13;
50.       These facts raise large questions about agricultural policy and&#13;
we are not comfortable about analysing them in this paper. But the fate of&#13;
manufacturing is so intimately bound up with farm incomes that we cannot&#13;
neglect these issues entirely. The present approach to increasing agricul-&#13;
tural production has placed the main emphasis on introducing fertilizers&#13;
and improved seeds in most countries. Little effort has been made to intro-&#13;
duce implements suitable for local conditions. Tractorisation has created&#13;
many problems of organization, maintenance and high costs, apart from the&#13;
fact that local production does not seem attractive under African condi-&#13;
tions. It is also true that in the absence of improved implements, congenial&#13;
to the agronomic situation, attempts to raise farm productivity have en-&#13;
countered a severe seasonal labour bottleneck. Given a relatively short&#13;
rainy season, the demand for labour tends to have steep peaks and troughs.&#13;
The use of fertiliser and improved seeds has accentuated these variations&#13;
in labour demand and resulted in inadequate planting, tilling and weeding.&#13;
51.       This is not the place to review experience in introducing suitable&#13;
agricultural tools, but the record is mixed. In many places the story is&#13;
discouraging, but in Sukumaland (Tanzania) it has been possible to introduce&#13;
ox-plows, seeders and locally designed inter-row weeders (Lele 1975).&#13;
1/ These data are drawn from East African Community, Annual Trade Report&#13;
for Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, 1975-76; and Government of Zambia,&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Similarly, in the Mazabuka district of Zambia, the full range of ox-drawn&#13;
equipment (plows, harrows, cultivators, planters and carts) is being used&#13;
effectively (Johnston and Kilby, 1975). These are not the only success&#13;
stories; animal traction may be feasible in many parts of Eastern Africa,&#13;
if sustained effort is made to train farmers, rear and train oxen, design&#13;
implements responsive to local condi{ions and promote the manufacture of&#13;
these implements.&#13;
52.       Our thesis is that,one of several bottlenecks impeding rapid&#13;
agricultural expansion is the neglect of suitable mechanical aids to&#13;
cultivation. If this impediment is removed as part of a balanced approach&#13;
to farm development, there will take place a progressive rise in rural in-&#13;
comes leading to a significant rise in the market for manufactured goods,&#13;
including farm implements. The production of these implements is scale-&#13;
neutral and can be organized with advantage on a small scale with close links&#13;
between farmers and craftsmen in local areas. The proximity of consumers&#13;
and producers of farm implements would facilitate a rich inter-action ,&#13;
with agricultural and industrial extension workers intermediating between&#13;
these groups. In turn, extension agents would need the support of a&#13;
research infrastructure aimed at producing designs of implements (respon-&#13;
sive to widely varying agronomic conditions) and testing them under field&#13;
conditions. The experience of the International Rice Research Institute&#13;
(IRRI) at Las Banos, Philippines is highly relevant in this context (IRRI,&#13;
1978). A comparable effort in Eastern Africa combining chemical-biological&#13;
research with engineering design work may produce a substantial pay-off.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
53.       The manufacture of agricultural implements can become a sizeable&#13;
activity as we look ahead a decade or two. In contrast, the manufacture of&#13;
construction materials was already of some significance around 1970; they&#13;
constituted 11% of total manufacturing output in Kenya, 15% in Zambia and&#13;
26% in Tanzania. Also, there was substantial room for import substitution&#13;
in this area. Imported inputs were nearly half of all inputs into the con-&#13;
struction industries of Zambia and Tanzania; the corresponding proportion&#13;
was one-fifth in Kenya (Table 7). It is our belief that a change in govern-&#13;
ment policy can bring about a rapid reduction in this import coefficient&#13;
and stimulate the vigorous growth of local manufacturing producing construc-&#13;
tion materials.&#13;
54.       A sharp dualism exists between urban construction (housing, public&#13;
buildings, etc.) and rural works outside the narrow modern sector. Typically,&#13;
the latter are made of mud, wattle and grass, while the former use concrete,&#13;
asbestos and corrugated iron. In Zambia, for example, 70% of rural dwellings&#13;
have grass roofs while 81% of urban housing uses asbestos or corrugated iron&#13;
(ILO, 1977). Present government policy sets "high standards" leading to high&#13;
cost, import-intensive construction. These standards are seldom applied&#13;
outside urban areas and government programmes of infrastructure and housing&#13;
have concentrated on cities and towns. Meanwhile, the bulk of the population&#13;
has continued to be rural and its low level of income has not permitted&#13;
the adoption of government approved construction standards. Clearly,&#13;
existing policies *are a hangover from the colonial period in which an&#13;
expatriate community dominated government decision-making. The aim of&#13;
fostering a development process which engages the majority of the population&#13;
cannot be achieved without a complete revision of the government posture on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
this issue of appropriate construction standards. A redefinition of these&#13;
standards should be reinforced by the imposition of fiscal disincentives&#13;
(excise taxes and equivalent import levies) on high cost-construction&#13;
materials of foreign origin.&#13;
55.       There will be the need to identify local building materials&#13;
and the manner in which they should be used. This requires research,&#13;
experimentation and material testing under field conditions. Clay products,&#13;
ceramics and tiles, lime, timber, particle board are possibilities in&#13;
almost all countries. Bricks can be produced in small kilns from local&#13;
clay and used in building instead of concrete blocks. Even sanitary ware&#13;
can be made from local clay, if the requirement that the final product be&#13;
brilliant white is dropped. The colour characteristic of sanitary ware&#13;
may not be crucial for achieving the designed functional properties.&#13;
Buildings can have locally fabricated wooden frames (treated against white&#13;
ants) instead of imported steel ones. Hydrated burnt lime, produced from&#13;
local limestones, can replace cement in many structures. Use can be made&#13;
of local timber to produce doors, windows, poles and frames instead of&#13;
importing metallic or plastic ones.&#13;
56.       The future growth of the construction industry based on local&#13;
materials also requires the availability of simple, inexpensive heavy-&#13;
duty, hand tools adapted to these materials and other local conditions.&#13;
The present market for such tools is not large, of course, but it will&#13;
expand if policy and institutional changes suggested in this paper are&#13;
adopted. The production of these tools is not subject to economies of&#13;
scale to any large extent; they can be fabricated locally in small batches.&#13;

Recent experience in organising labour-intensive road construction in&#13;
Kenya demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating and marketing suitable&#13;
hand-tools. Wheel barrows, shovels, plain hoes, forked hoes, spreaders,&#13;
pick-axes, crow-bars, sledge-hammers etc., were designed, partly based on&#13;
local hardwood. Local artisans agreed to produce tools based on these&#13;
designs, once government agreed to change its purchase policy in favour&#13;
of tenders with specification of these improved tools.&#13;
57.       To conclude, the prospects for the economic recovery of Africa&#13;
depend in the main on what happens to agriculture. We have not argued&#13;
this point in the present paper but this conclusion is not controversial&#13;
(Acharya 1981). A substantial supply response from this sector can be&#13;
obtained in the near term through the implementation of suitable policy-cum-&#13;
institutional reform packages. Increments in rural income will provide&#13;
the market stimulus for an even more rapid increase in manufacturing&#13;
output. A growing share of household income will be spent on manufactured&#13;
consumer goods thereby activating existing capacity in many lines of pro-&#13;
duction, provided the foreign exchange constraint is relaxed. Simultaneously,&#13;
there needs to take place a process of restructuring existing capacity&#13;
in response to a reformed exchange rate, trade and incentive regime.&#13;
This will involve phasing out some product lines and auxiliary investments&#13;
in other plants. It will also mean that existing firms will have to compete&#13;
much more than heretofore with rival local producers and with imports. This&#13;
should help to tone up the efficiency of existing industry. Managers and&#13;
labourers will 'learn by doing' much more effectively if there is a com-&#13;
petitive pressure to do so. New price relationships resulting from the&#13;
reform in incentives will reveal opportunities for additional import&#13;
substitution in consumer goods, necessitating a round of new investment in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
some areas. In addition, we have suggested scope for replacing imported&#13;
construction materials with local substitutes and producing agricultural&#13;
implements responsive to local needs. This will require a concerted effort&#13;
to carry out adaptive research, field testing and industrial extension.&#13;
It will also require fiscal discouragement of the 'purchase of inappropriate'&#13;
construction materials and agricultural machinery, irrespective of whether&#13;
these are imported or produced locally.&#13;
58.       We cannot be optimistic about the prospects for rapid growth of&#13;
manufactured exports from Africa in the near term, given the acute scarcity&#13;
of skilled labour and experienced entrepreneurs,and given the reluctance&#13;
of many governments to assign a prominent role to TNCs. The skill and&#13;
entrepreneurship constraints will ease over time as experience is gained,and&#13;
as the stock of high-level manpower is augmented through education and&#13;
training. These developments will set the stage for the rapid growth of&#13;
African manufactured exports.&#13;

ANNEX NOTE A&#13;
A critical disadvantage of our analysis in Table 3 is that it&#13;
is based on a comparison of two years. In order to test the sensitivity&#13;
of these results to the choice of the end points defining the period, we&#13;
used a rather simple measure of imiort substitution which, though conceptually&#13;
not fully satisfactory, has the major advantage of being much more amenable&#13;
to trend analysis, given data limitations. This measure is the ratio of the&#13;
volume index of total imports to the quantity index of manufacturing production.&#13;
The volume index of total imports can be used as a proxy for manufactured&#13;
imports in the I.S.I.C. sense because, in fact, the latter constitute the&#13;
bulk of Eastern Africa imports. For Kenya and Tanzania, we mean net imports,&#13;
i.e., imports from countries outside the East African Community. Food con-&#13;
stituted only 6% of Kenyan imports (1971) and 5.5% of Zambian imports (1977).&#13;
Food, beverages and tobacco accounted for 10.2% of Tanzanian imports (1977)-&#13;
a significant portion of this is processed. The rates of decline of this&#13;
ratio are presented below:&#13;

a/  Volume index of imports/quantity index of manufactured output.&#13;
Note:  The rates of decline have been estimated from log-linear trend&#13;
lines. The estimates of R2 provides us with an index of the&#13;
smoothness of the import substitution process. Since indices&#13;
of industrial production do not exist for Tanzania, we have&#13;
employed a separate procedure - dividing the value of total&#13;
manufactured imports by the value of gross output (both in&#13;
current prices).&#13;

ANNEX NOTE A&#13;
The picture that we get from this table is essentially the same&#13;
as that provided by Table 3 in the text. The greatest import substitution&#13;
is in Zambia and the least in Tanzania. Moreover, the low R2 for Tanzania&#13;
indicates that the process of import substitution has been much more erratic&#13;
in comparison with Kenya and Zambia.&#13;

ANNEX NOTE&#13;
Decomposition of output growth&#13;
Consider the basic identity&#13;
A = Q + M = R + D - X&#13;
where A, Q, M and X represent total supply, output, imports and exports&#13;
respectively. R and D are intermediate and final domestic demand respectively.&#13;
Totally differentiating this identity gives&#13;
dA = dR + dD - dX&#13;
Now, let    u = Q/A&#13;
Therefore    Q = Au&#13;
Totally differentiating:&#13;
dQ = u(dA) + Adu&#13;
Taking a discrete change from time period lto 2, we get&#13;
Change in output, LZ Q = uI (i6R +AD) + u 1 OX) + (u2-uI) A2&#13;
This relationship parcels out additional domestic output into three categories:&#13;
(a) u1 (a R +AD) for intermediate and final demand use on the assumption&#13;
that the domestic output/total availability ratio remains constant;&#13;
(b) uI (A X) for export, again on the assumption of a fixed u; and&#13;
(c)  (u2-u ) A   which is the change In domestic output implied by the actual&#13;
change in {he domestic output/total availability ratio (i.e., import&#13;
substitution).&#13;

            Industrial strategy for late starters : the
            experience of Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Based on the existing literature and the
            circumscribed data base, this paper assesses the extent and
            nature of industrialization in three African countries.
            After a promising start, the drive to industrialize is now
            faltering. The record is influenced much more by the
            colonial legacy and the macro-economic situation of each
            country than by industrial policy. It is clear that future
            industrial advance will depend heavily on the pace of rural
            development. Catering to world markets is not likely to
            provide a major stimulus for the industrial sector of many
            African economies in the near term future.
