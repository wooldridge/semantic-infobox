&amp;#12;Data notes&#13;
The data in this book are for 1990, 2003, and 2004 or the most recent year&#13;
&#13;
available unless otherwise noted in the glossary.&#13;
&#13;
     ·   Growth rates are proportional changes from the previous year unless&#13;
&#13;
         otherwise noted.&#13;
&#13;
     ·   Regional aggregates include data for low- and middle-income&#13;
&#13;
         economies only.&#13;
&#13;
     ·   Data in italics are for years or periods other than those specified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
          ..   indicates that data are not available or that aggregates cannot&#13;
&#13;
               be calculated because of missing data.&#13;
&#13;
    0 or 0.0   indicates zero or less than half the unit shown.&#13;
&#13;
          $    indicates current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The word country&#13;
&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence or&#13;
&#13;
official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which the&#13;
&#13;
authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In keeping with World Development Indicators 2006, this edition of The Little&#13;
&#13;
Data Book uses terminology in line with the 1993 System of National&#13;
&#13;
Accounts. In particular, gross national product (GNP) is replaced by gross&#13;
&#13;
national income (GNI).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The selection of indicators in these pages includes some that are being used&#13;
&#13;
to monitor progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. For more infor-&#13;

&amp;#12;                   Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank's main criterion for clas-&#13;
&#13;
sifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every economy is clas-&#13;
&#13;
sified as low income, middle income (subdivided into lower middle and upper&#13;
&#13;
middle), or high income. Low-and middle-income economies are sometimes&#13;
&#13;
referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient; it is not&#13;
&#13;
intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing similar devel-&#13;
&#13;
opment or that other economies have reached a preferred or final stage of devel-&#13;
&#13;
opment. Classification by income does not necessarily reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $825 or less in 2004.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than $825&#13;
&#13;
but less than $10,066. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income&#13;
&#13;
economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $3,255.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $10,066 or more.&#13;

Access to improved sanitation facilities is the percentage of the population&#13;
   with at least adequate excreta disposal facilities (private or shared, but&#13;
   not public) that can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect con-&#13;
   tact with excreta. Improved facilities range from simple but protected pit&#13;
   latrines to flush toilets with a sewerage connection. To be effective, facil-&#13;
   ities must be correctly constructed and properly maintained. (World&#13;
   Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring&#13;
   Programme)&#13;

   well or spring, or rainwater collection. Unimproved sources include vendors,&#13;
   tanker trucks, and unprotected wells and springs. Reasonable access is&#13;
   defined as the availability of at least 20 liters a person a day from a source&#13;
   within 1 kilometer of the dwelling. (World Health Organization/United&#13;

Cash surplus/deficit is revenue (including grants) minus expense, minus net&#13;
   acquisition of nonfinancial assets. Before 2005 nonfinancial assets were&#13;
   included under revenue and expenditure in gross terms. The concept of&#13;
   cash surplus or deficit is close to the earlier overall budget balance (still&#13;
   missing is lending minus repayments, which is brought into the balance&#13;
   sheet as a financing item under net acquisition of financial assets).&#13;

    agricultural use not counting evaporation losses from storage basins.&#13;
    Internal resources refer to internal renewable resources only (flows of&#13;
    rivers and groundwater from rainfall in the country). Withdrawals can&#13;
    exceed 100 percent of internal renewable resources because river flows&#13;
    from other countries are not included, because extraction from nonre-&#13;
    newable aquifers or desalination plants is considerable, or because there&#13;
    is significant water reuse. (Food and Agriculture Organization and World&#13;
    Resources Institute)&#13;

   jects as history, geography, natural science, social science, art, and music.&#13;
   Secondary education completes the provision of basic education that began&#13;
   at the primary level and aims at laying the foundations for lifelong learning&#13;
   and human development by offering more subject- or skill-oriented instruc-&#13;
   tion using more specialized teachers. And tertiary education, whether or not&#13;
   leading to an advanced research qualification, normally requires, as a min-&#13;

    expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' bene-&#13;
    fits, demobilization, conversion, and destruction of weapons. This defini-&#13;
    tion cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require&#13;
    much more detailed information than is available about what is included&#13;
    in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (Stockholm&#13;
    International Peace Research Institute)&#13;
&#13;
    [Note for China: Estimate differs from official statistics of the government&#13;

            The Little Data Book (LDB) 2006 is a
            pocket edition of World Development Indicators (WDI) 2006.
            It is intended as a quick reference for users of WDI 2006
            book and CD-ROM and WDI online, electronic subscription
            database. Together, they cover more than 800 indicators and
            span 40 years. The 208 pages of country tables in the LDB
            present the latest available data for World Bank member
            countries and other economies with populations of more than
            30,000. The 14 summary pages cover aggregate data for
            regional and income groups. The data in this book are for
            1990, 2003, and 2004 or the most recent year available
            unless otherwise noted in the glossary: i) growth rates are
            proportional changes from the previous year unless otherwise
            noted; ii) regional aggregates include data for low- and
            middle-income economies only; and iii) data in italics are
            for years or periods other than those specified. In keeping
            with WDI 2006, this edition of The Little Data Book uses
            terminology in line with the 1993 system of national
            accounts. In particular, gross national product (GNP) is
            replaced by gross national income (GNI).
