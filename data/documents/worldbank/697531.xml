FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
TRANSIT FACILITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                Republican Road Organization of the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia&#13;
Guarantor:               Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
Executing Agencies:      Republican Road Organization of the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia (RO); Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communications (MTC); Ministry of Urban Development,&#13;
Civil Engineering, and Environment (MUDCEE); and&#13;
Customs Agency.&#13;
Beneficiaries:           Project benefits would accrue to the economy as a whole. The&#13;
reduction of transport costs expected from the project would&#13;
increase the competitiveness of the country's goods. In the&#13;
short run, the project would help to alleviate the impact on&#13;
transport costs of the disruption of traffic in the Balkans.&#13;
Loan Amount:             US$24.0 million equivalent.&#13;
Terms:                   Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the standard&#13;
variable interest rate.&#13;
Project Objectives:      The main objectives of the project are to assist the&#13;
Government to: (i) address the crisis created for transport in&#13;
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia caused by the&#13;
closure of the Serbian and Greek borders, through the&#13;
facilitation of East-West transport so as to reduce transport&#13;
costs; and (ii) strengthen the road management capabilities of&#13;
MTC, MUDCEE and RO, particularly in the area of planning&#13;
and pavement management.&#13;
Project Description:     The project would have three components: (i) the civil works&#13;
component would improve the country's access to the ports of&#13;
Bulgaria and Albania through the rehabilitation and upgrading&#13;
of about 60 km of the East-West Corridor; (ii) the transit&#13;
facilitation component will fund technical assistance and&#13;
equipment for the development and implementation of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
modem customs system and the improvement of transit times;&#13;
and (iii) the institutional strengthening component will fund&#13;
technical assistance and training to strengthen MTC,&#13;
MUDCEE and RO in the area of economic evaluation of&#13;
different road interventions and life-cost planning for&#13;
pavement management.&#13;
Project Benefits:         The proposed project will facilitate the international movement&#13;
of goods and passengers through the reduction of transport&#13;
costs in one of the main export-import corridors in the&#13;
country. This will be accomplished by reducing congestion in&#13;
the Tetovo-Gostivar road section, decreasing the present value&#13;
of road expenditures in the Kichevo-Botun road section by&#13;
rehabilitating the road now and avoiding more expensive&#13;
reconstruction at a later date, and reducing border crossing&#13;
waiting time by incorporating modem customs procedures.&#13;
The technical assistance component is also expected to&#13;
improve the allocation of the scarce national resources.&#13;
Project Risks:            The project does not present any technical or environmental&#13;
risks. The main risk is related to the fragile political and&#13;
economic situation facing the country, which may impact the&#13;
availability of counterpart funds. That risk, however, is&#13;
within acceptable levels because of the high priority of the&#13;
road works, the historic financial independence and solvency&#13;
of RO, the small share that the proposed investments represent&#13;
in RO's budget, and the amount of retroactive financing&#13;
proposed for the project. There are also risks related to the&#13;
possible lack of coordination among the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Bulgaria, to improve&#13;
border crossings, thus reducing the expected benefits. This is&#13;
mitigated by ongoing agreements, that are being implemented&#13;
satisfactorily. In addition, the current presence of the Bank in&#13;
the transport sector of the three countries, provides an&#13;
opportunity for encouraging systematic tri-lateral performance&#13;
monitoring at the borders, which would further reduce that&#13;
risk.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return:  About 20% for the civil works component.&#13;

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
TRANSIT FACILITATION PROJECT&#13;
I. THE ECONOMY AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1         The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a small, landlocked economy&#13;
with a population of 2.2 million people. Population growth is just under 1 % per year, and&#13;
per capita income in 1993 was US$780, down from US$1,360 in 1990. Past policies&#13;
emphasizing industry have made this a dominant sector constituting 47% of GDP; services&#13;
constitute about 38%, and agriculture 15%. The economy of the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia is also very open (annual exports and imports equal nearly 65% of&#13;
GDP) and hence extremely vulnerable to any impediments to its external trade.&#13;
1.2         From its inception three years ago following the breakup of Yugoslavia, in&#13;
common with other countries undergoing transition to market economies, the country has&#13;
had to face large-scale dislocation in production, employment and social welfare. Also,&#13;
economic management in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been vastly&#13;
complicated by the United Nations (UN) trade and transit sanctions against former&#13;
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), and by the closure of its southern border by Greece&#13;
which deprive it of its access to Salonika, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's&#13;
closest and most economic outlet to the sea. The country had therefore to rely on&#13;
alternative routes which substantially increased transport costs. Together all these factors&#13;
have brought wrenching changes in the economy, involving persistent drops in output (13%&#13;
each year in 1990-93) and rising rate of unemployment (from 23% in 1990 to 29% in&#13;
1993) at the same time as various subsidies were cut and prices soared (annual inflation&#13;
averaged 407% during 1990-93).&#13;
1.3         The Government's ongoing stabilization program combines an incomes&#13;
policy, tight monetary stance, a flexible exchange rate regime, and domestic resource&#13;
mobilization, the latter involving reduction of distortionary expenditures--e.g., agricultural&#13;
input subsidies--as well as efficient revenue enhancement measures. These efforts pulled&#13;
the country back from the brink of hyperinflation in 1993 and, in 1994, have lowered&#13;
inflation and enabled the authorities to stay well within targeted performance agreed with&#13;
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Structural policy reforms already in place include&#13;
liberalization of trade and pricing policies; a major tax reform involving rationalization of&#13;
income and sales tax; passage of two laws to advance privatization and establishment of a&#13;
proactive task force to restructure important public enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.4         Despite commendable initiatives to date under very difficult conditions, the&#13;
country still faces a long, hard agenda of industrial, financial and social sector reforms&#13;
necessary to establish a coherent policy and institutional framework for sustained growth&#13;
and poverty reduction. The country has been engaged in a policy dialogue with the Bank&#13;
and the IMF and appears prepared to deepen economic reforms over the medium term. Its&#13;
medium-term growth prospects will critically depend also on availability of sufficient&#13;
external finance.&#13;
B. The Transport Sector&#13;
1.5         The main transport infrastructure in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia consists of 8,216 km of roads (of which about 4,900 are paved), a railway&#13;
network of 700km, and two international airports in Skopje and Ohrid. The primary road&#13;
network, under the jurisdiction of the RO, is 3,526 km long and carries about 75% of the&#13;
country's freight traffic. Until Greece closed its borders, the railways concentrated on the&#13;
transport of low-value bulk commodities to and from the port of Salonika in Greece. The&#13;
configuration of the transport system was influenced by geopolitical considerations of the&#13;
former Yugoslavia, which emphasized the development of the North-South Corridor (namely&#13;
the Trans-Yugoslav Highway) which was developed with Bank financing (para. 1.15).&#13;
1.6         The development of the East-West corridor, although growing in importance&#13;
for domestic traffic and as a feeder of the North-South artery, was hampered by the political&#13;
and economic isolation of Albania, which until 1992 prohibited transit through its territory,&#13;
and to some extent, by the administrative difficulties of crossing Bulgaria and the commercial&#13;
relations and practices inherent to the centrally planned economies. The situation has now&#13;
changed: the North-South corridor is closed due to the UN-imposed blockade of&#13;
Serbia/Montenegro and unresolved issues with Greece. As a result, the port of Salonika no&#13;
longer serves the landlocked former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Road transport&#13;
through the East-West road corridor has now become the lifeline of the country's economy.&#13;
Although the Government is planning to complete the East-West rail link to Bulgaria (para.&#13;
1.8), the road corridor is now the only connection of the country with the rest of the world.&#13;
The road subsector is discussed in detail in Chapter II.&#13;
1.7         Macedonian Railways consists today of a 700km network employing a staff of&#13;
about 5,300 for basic services, down from more than 6,600 employees in 1989. Staff&#13;
reductions are largely the result of attrition and an early retirement scheme. The railway&#13;
company is also in the process of privatizing other non-core enterprises (employing 2,500 to&#13;
3,000 persons) for forwarding services, trucking, tourism, etc. Freight movements in 1990&#13;
were about 6.5 million tons a year, but the volume in 1993 was down to 3.4 million (all&#13;
local traffic), as services to the port of Salonika were interrupted. Even in the past, the&#13;
railways made significant operating losses, partly because rail tariffs were set at levels well&#13;
below costs. Although operating losses are now not substantial, the balance has been&#13;
achieved by an unsustainable reduction of maintenance. Also, because of uncollected&#13;
receivables, the railways have a cash flow deficit of about US$1 million per month, financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
through short-term borrowing. Access to loans, however, will be curtailed in 1995, and the&#13;
railways are looking at ways to address this issue through increased tariffs. In the medium-&#13;
term, the economic role of the railways should be assessed and unprofitable lines and/or&#13;
services should be discontinued. The Government, as part of its economic restructuring&#13;
program, is planning to privatize ancillary services and to clearly separate commercial&#13;
activities from those social services requiring direct subsidies.&#13;
1.8          The railway company is also considering to construct a 60 km rail link to&#13;
Bulgaria as part of the government's plan to diversify land transport links with neighboring&#13;
countries. The cost of this link has been estimated at some US$1 10 million. The German&#13;
Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is financing a feasibility study of this project which&#13;
is to be completed by mid-1995.&#13;
Transport Sector Issues&#13;
1.9          One of the main problems of the sector is to evaluate the future volume and&#13;
pattern of traffic demand. The shift to a market economy is likely to result in less emphasis&#13;
on transport intensive industries, such as minerals, and more on higher value added light&#13;
industry, such as textiles and agro-industry. The latter will require lower transport volumes&#13;
and are more likely to use road transport than rail transport. The comparative advantage of&#13;
the country in the production of perishable goods, will also result in increased demand for air&#13;
transport, an area in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)&#13;
is providing support. '&#13;
1.10         Within this uncertain environment, the transport sector agenda is being&#13;
dominated by two main issues, the crisis generated by the blockades in Serbia/Montenegro&#13;
and Greece and the resulting emergency movement of trade through Albania and Bulgaria&#13;
(the East-West corridor), and the future role of the railways in the country's economy. The&#13;
first government priority is to address the current crisis and upgrade the East-West road link,&#13;
an objective that will be supported under the proposed project. Also the Government is&#13;
considering completion of the railway link with Bulgaria (para. 1.8) and construction of an&#13;
oil pipeline from the port of Burgas. In addition, as part of the preparation of the proposed&#13;
Bank-financed Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (FESAC), which will focus&#13;
on the restructuring of the 25 highest money-losing enterprises in the country, consultants&#13;
have been retained to prepare a short-term cost reduction program and a medium-term&#13;
business plan to turn the railways into a commercially-oriented enterprise.&#13;
1 .11        Border crossing remains a major bottleneck in East-West traffic due to lack of&#13;
physical facilities and cumbersome procedures.  Efforts to improve regional trade are taking&#13;
place in an active framework of consultation and coordination under the auspices of the G-24&#13;
Group and the European Union (EU). The Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
1/    A growing transport of perishable goods is currently taking place through a road corridor linking the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Bulgaria, Romania and Central Europe. Emergency border&#13;
crossing procedures have been established throughout the corridor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Macedonia, in particular, is taking important steps to reduce the cost imposed by long&#13;
waiting times and resulting idleness of vehicles and goods. Physical facilities are being&#13;
improved with bilateral financing. They include increased parking spaces, special lanes for&#13;
empty vehicles and adequate inspection facilities. A study carried out by the US Customs&#13;
Agency as part of bilateral US technical assistance to the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia, identified a program of investments and technical assistance to modernize and&#13;
improve customs procedures, which served as the basis for the transit facilitation component&#13;
to be financed under the project (para 3.7).&#13;
1.12        Being a landlocked country, international trade for the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia involves significant use of neighboring ports. Therefore, interface&#13;
with Bulgarian and Albanian ports and concerted efforts at the borders to facilitate traffic to&#13;
and from the ports should be major elements in the country's transport strategy. The&#13;
Governments of Albania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are&#13;
taking significant steps to improve trade flows, as reflected in several bi-lateral and multi-&#13;
lateral agreements and protocols related to border crossings and to the use by the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of the port facilities in Durres and Burgas. Also, the&#13;
ongoing Transport Project in Albania, Credit 2499-ALB, includes the preparation of a master&#13;
plan for the port of Durres which will address the issue of port facilities to serve the needs of&#13;
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. However, much remains to be done in terms&#13;
of establishing a systematic dialogue on common trade problems, identifying and&#13;
implementing remedial actions and monitoring performance. The proposed project, coupled&#13;
with the ongoing Bank presence in the transport sectors of Albania and Bulgaria, will provide&#13;
an opportunity for encouraging and enhancing tri-lateral cooperation in transit facilitation.&#13;
C. Bank Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.13        The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia became a member of the Bank,&#13;
IDA and IFC on December 30, 1993 (effective February 25, 1994) upon fulfillment of the&#13;
requirements of succession approved by the Executive Directors, including an agreement on a&#13;
plan to clear the country's arrears to the Bank. Arrears clearance took place in February&#13;
1994, after which an Economic Recovery Loan/Credit (ERL I) was approved. The Bank's&#13;
assistance strategy is focused on the following four main areas: (i) inducing a rapid&#13;
development of the country's private sector through a series of adjustment operations targeted&#13;
mainly at the enterprise, banking and the social sectors; (ii) developing the country's human&#13;
resources in a sustainable way; (iii) maintaining the country's infrastructure, and (iv)&#13;
protecting the country's natural resources and environment. The strategy emphasizes short-&#13;
term economic objectives, in particular meeting the balance of payment shortages, deepening&#13;
the economic restructuring, and strengthening the social safety net. This objective will be&#13;
supported by the proposed FESAC and the proposed Social Reform and Technical Assistance&#13;
Project, which are in an advanced stage of preparation, and by the retroactive financing&#13;
proposed herein (para. 3.16). In addition, the Bank is chairing a Consultative Group&#13;
designed to mobilize additional financial resources, which are critical to the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia's ability to overcome its depressed situation. With respect to the&#13;
country's infrastructure, the Bank strategy is based on the premise that developing the&#13;
transport sector capacity through restoring and diversifying trading routes will have a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
revitalizing impact in the country's economy. Its immediate objective would be to upgrade&#13;
the East-West transport links and to improve access to naval ports in order to address the&#13;
present emergency due to the interruption of North-South traffic, in a manner consistent with&#13;
national priorities should trade and transport in the region once again be normalized&#13;
(para. 4.4). The proposed project has been designed to implement this strategy.&#13;
D. Past Bank Experience&#13;
1.14        The Bank has made 25 loans for transport to the former Republic of&#13;
Yugoslavia totalling US$ 1.7 billion equivalent since 1963. These include thirteen loans to&#13;
the highway subsector (Annex 1), eight loans for the railway subsector, one loan for the port&#13;
of Bar, a multimodal loan for earthquake rehabilitation, and two pipeline projects.&#13;
1.15        The main emphasis in early highway lending had been on improvement of key&#13;
links in the primary road network, mainly the completion of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway.&#13;
Successive Project Completion Reports indicate that the projects were successful in achieving&#13;
their objectives, albeit with delays due to shortages of local funds. Subsequent lending&#13;
followed a sector approach and included a deeper involvement in the important areas of road&#13;
maintenance, road pricing and systematic use of cost-benefit analysis in road planning.&#13;
Annex 1 provides details of those projects which directly benefitted the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia.&#13;
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. Network and Traffic&#13;
2.1         Historic trade routes, the waves of invading armies and the very rugged terrain&#13;
have all played a part in the location and development of roads in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia. The present main highway alignments follow the old trade routes&#13;
and mountain passes to provide land connections between Europe and the East. The Romans&#13;
were first to build engineered roads and, although rebuilt under the Ottoman Empire and&#13;
improved under Napoleon, the alignments of these major roads have changed little and still&#13;
provide the most important land transportation links between the Adriatic and Black Seas and&#13;
Europe and the East.&#13;
2.2         Road Network. The road network totals 8,216 km of which some 4,900 km,&#13;
or about 60%, have been modernized and about 3,300 still have earth surfacing. Roads are&#13;
classified as Arterial, Regional and Local. Of the total network, 915 km are Arterial, 2611&#13;
km are Regional and 4,690 km are Local. In addition to the national classification, about&#13;
520 km of the arterial roads are part of the European road network ('E' Roads). The&#13;
following table shows the length of each category and the percentage of each classification&#13;
which has been modernized. The Arterial and Regional roads are the responsibility of the&#13;
RO and Local roads are the responsibility of the municipalities.&#13;

2.3          The arterial network serves seven major corridors in the country. The most&#13;
important corridor is served by the 174 km arterial Road No. 1, a section of the Trans-&#13;
European E-75 highway, which runs roughly north-south across the country from the border&#13;
with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) to the border with Greece&#13;
(Map IBRD 26331). This road is the spine of the system and was the most heavily trafficked&#13;
road up to 1990. About 91 km of this road have been upgraded to highway/expressway&#13;
standard and the construction of an additional 5 km is underway. The next most important&#13;
arterial road serving international and national traffic is the East-West corridor, the subject of&#13;
this project. The 302 km road runs from the Bulgarian border at Deve Bair through Skopje,&#13;
Gostivar and Ohrid to the Albanian border and connects Skopje with Sofia, capital of&#13;
Bulgaria, and Tirana, capital of Albania as well as linking the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia with ports on the Black and Adriatic Seas. The third most important corridor is&#13;
also in an East-West direction and is served by a 330 km arterial road which runs from the&#13;
Bulgarian border near Delchevo through Veles, Bitola and Ohrid to the Albanian and Greek&#13;
borders. This alignment passes through the central region of the Republic but, because of&#13;
the very difficult terrain and consequent poor geometric standards, does not serve&#13;
international traffic well.&#13;
2.4         Traffic. Road transport in and through the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia has been seriously disrupted since the political changes and problems in the&#13;
Balkan peninsula. The UN blockade on the countries to the north and the embargo imposed&#13;
by Greece have reduced international traffic on the network very substantially and have&#13;
changed its pattern and direction. By 1990, the annual average daily traffic (AADT) on the&#13;
Arterial Road No. 1 in the north-south direction had reached 7,000 to 10,000, with about&#13;
15,000 vehicles per day during the tourist months of July and August. Since the events in&#13;
Serbia and Greece, this traffic has been reduced by 50%. However, traffic has increased on&#13;
the arterial road running in the east-west direction connecting Sofia, Skopje and the port of&#13;
Durres on the Adriatic Sea in Albania. As already mentioned, the road is now the country's&#13;
only effective international link. The traffic on this road, which ranged from 1,500 to 5,500&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
AADT along various sections, has increased by about 60% and now ranges from 4,000 to&#13;
8,500 AADT. Traffic on the remaining arterial roads ranges from about an AADT of 2,500&#13;
to 4,000 and traffic on the regional roads ranges from an AADT of 500 to 3,000.&#13;
2.5          Vehicle Fleet. The following table shows the number of motor vehicles&#13;
registered each year from 1984 through 1993. Vehicle registration shows a steady annual&#13;
growth rate of about 4% from 1984 to 1990. Reflecting the increased reliance on road&#13;
transport, the annual growth rate of the vehicle fleet accelerated to more than 10% for the&#13;
years 1991 to 1993. Passenger cars amount to about 88% of the present vehicle fleet with&#13;
truck and buses representing about 5% and the balance being tractors and trailers.&#13;

B. Road Transport&#13;
2.6         There are three types of trucking in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia: public social sector trucking (self-managed) enterprises,2 own-account trucking&#13;
(mostly in social sector industrial and manufacturing firms), and private sector operators.&#13;
Social sector firms specialize in long distance and international traffic. Own-account and&#13;
private operators, until recently, specialized in local transport. The road freight industry was&#13;
heavily regulated until about 1989, through various laws which limited the participation of&#13;
2/    Social sector enterprises are firms owned and managed by employees and workers. In past practice, they&#13;
enjoyed substantial Government financial privileges and the Government influenced their level of&#13;
employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
the private sector (barriers to entry; prohibitions against international transport; more&#13;
favorable tax rates and customs duties for social sector firms, etc.). These formal&#13;
regulations were reinforced by various social contracts and informal arrangements which&#13;
served to divide the market, and by accounting and managerial practices which permitted&#13;
social sector firms to operate inefficiently and sustain losses over the long term. In addition,&#13;
domestic truck manufacturing was protected in the former Yugoslavia, resulting in the use of&#13;
lower quality domestic trucks by many operators. However, the regulations were unevenly&#13;
enforced, which coupled with a relatively dynamic private sector, resulted in the private&#13;
sector increasing their share of the market (measured in km). The regulatory framework also&#13;
resulted in the inefficient growth of own account fleets: domestic producers were able to&#13;
take advantage of the country's cost-plus pricing system and buy their own trucks, which&#13;
they did not use efficiently, and passed on higher transport costs without penalty under&#13;
conditions of excess demand.&#13;
2.7         In 1989, the Government of the former Yugoslavia passed a privatization law&#13;
affecting several sectors of the economy including transport. The Government in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continued with these reforms which are currently in place.&#13;
They include: permitting the private sector to operate internationally and foreign trucks to&#13;
operate inside the country, reducing tariffs and removing regulations on importing foreign&#13;
vehicles; equalizing tax rates and enforcement between social sector enterprises and private&#13;
sector operators; and separating the accounts of trucking and bus subsidiaries which were&#13;
owned by the railways so that they would not benefit from the subsidies received by the&#13;
latter.&#13;
2.8          The Government is actively working on other issues which would enhance the&#13;
efficiency of the trucking industry: complete the privatization of social sector firms; train&#13;
road operators in modern management practices; improve credit facilities for vehicle&#13;
purchases; increase vehicle leasing arrangements; introduce a computer-based freight&#13;
information system; and publicize the merits of a market-based road transport industry&#13;
among decision makers. Annex 2 provides further details of the trucking industry in the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.&#13;
C. Road Safety&#13;
2.9          The table below shows the number of road traffic accidents and fatalities each&#13;
year from 1984 through 1993. Despite some improvement during 1990 and 1991, the&#13;
number of accidents increased significantly in 1992 (+12%) and 1993 (+17%). By&#13;
extrapolation, the number of fatalities per million vehicles for 1993 was about 500.&#13;
Comparable figures for the U.K. and Germany in 1990 are 320 and 450, respectively.&#13;

D. Highway Administration and Organization&#13;
2.10        Highway administration in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is&#13;
unique. Until the beginning of 1990, the organization followed a pattern laid down by the&#13;
Associated Labour Act of 1976 common to all the former Yugoslav Republics, by which a&#13;
Community of Interest was responsible for roads policy and its administration, with work&#13;
activities being carried out by independent Basic Organizations of Associated Labour&#13;
(BOALS). A Community of Interest for Roads, or Siz za Ceste (SIZ), was made up of an&#13;
assembly of delegates from entities having an interest in roads, such as trucking enterprises,&#13;
factories, and urban and local road communities. Within Federal and Republic laws and&#13;
guided by Social Contracts, the assemblies gave policy directives to their Secretariat which&#13;
was charged with putting policy into practice. The Secretariat was headed by a Secretary&#13;
who was an assembly appointee. With Design, Construction and Maintenance Divisions, the&#13;
Secretariat of the SIZ resembled a public works department with the exception that little or&#13;
no work was carried out by force account. For planning and design work, the SIZ employed&#13;
Highway Institutes; for maintenance the specialized Road Maintenance Enterprises (RMEs)&#13;
and for construction, independent contractors.&#13;
2.11        In 1990, the SIZs reorganized like most organizations in the former&#13;
Yugoslavia to respond to the new Enterprise Law and other constitutional changes, and&#13;
became Social Funds for Arterial and Regional Roads. The principal characteristic of these&#13;
new Road Organizations (ROs) was that their administration was simplified. The RO, as it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
remains today, is governed by a managing board of 12 members rather than the much larger&#13;
Assemblies which managed the SIZs. The Secretary is proposed by the managing board and&#13;
confirmed by Parliament.&#13;
2.12         The RO manages the Arterial and Regional roads. The local roads are the&#13;
responsibility of the municipal road authorities. The RO has a staff of 26 of which 14 are&#13;
qualified professionals such as engineers, economists and a lawyer. They are responsible for&#13;
preparing road development programs and financing plans as well as implementing policy&#13;
directives given by Parliament. The law requires a feasibility study to be done on all&#13;
investment proposals before their inclusion in the development program. These feasibility&#13;
studies are usually done by the Highway Institute, an independent agency closely related to&#13;
the University. The annual and mid-term development programs are approved by&#13;
Parliament.&#13;
E. Planning&#13;
2.13         The institutional framework and procedures laid down at the central level are&#13;
adequate for formulating rational and efficient road development plans if the system is&#13;
judiciously used. The existing system allows for orderly reconciliation of top-down&#13;
strategies agreed at the Legislature with bottom-up programs representing the proposals of&#13;
various communities. Based on these proposals, RO prepares Five-Year Plans and annual&#13;
programs for road development for approval and ratification by Legislature. The&#13;
administrative process, in principle, is conducive for formulating rational road development&#13;
plans. However, actual functioning of the planning procedure is less than adequate.&#13;
2.14         Project Preparation and Selection. Investment programs approved by the&#13;
Legislature include projects which have not been subjected to proper feasibility studies. At&#13;
times, the selection of projects is based on considerations other than economic viability and&#13;
efficiency. Even in those cases where feasibility studies have been carried out, the approach&#13;
adopted is, at times, inadequate to yield sound results. There are also cases in which&#13;
feasibility studies are used to justify a posteriori the investment decisions which have already&#13;
been made. Nevertheless, resource constraints which are currently facing the country have&#13;
made RO increasingly aware of the need for applying economic criteria in formulating their&#13;
investment and expenditure programs. During the implementation of the proposed project,&#13;
the Five-Year Highway Investment and Maintenance Plan (1996-2000) will be assessed to&#13;
ensure that it is in line with the priority needs of the road network, projected transport&#13;
demand, and projected revenues. The Bank has reviewed the 1995-1997 program and found&#13;
it satisfactory (para. 2.21). During negotiations. it was agreed that RO shall not carry out&#13;
investments for the expansion. upgrading and maintenance of its road network unless it has&#13;
been established that such investments are economically viable and environmentally sound.&#13;
on the basis of criteria and guidelines satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.1 (a)).&#13;
2.15         RO has been contracting feasibility studies for major road investments to local&#13;
firms. These studies have been prepared since 1974 in accordance with the Guidelines for&#13;
Preparing Highway Feasibility Studies which were developed with Bank assistance.&#13;
Individual feasibility studies have, since 1974, incorporated various improvements to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Guidelines although they have not yet been applied in a systematic way. In addition, the&#13;
Guidelines were intended primarily for the evaluation of major new construction projects,&#13;
whereas many investment decisions involve comparison of different levels of improvement to&#13;
existing roads with the possibility of constructing on new alignment. The Guidelines&#13;
therefore require updating, in part to incorporate computer models which have been&#13;
developed since 1974, techniques for evaluating investments in tourist areas, and&#13;
environmental impact assessments. The proposed technical assistance to be financed under&#13;
the project will address the strengthening of RO's planning capabilities (para. 3.8).&#13;
F. Engineering, Construction and Maintenance&#13;
2.16         Engineering. In addition to the feasibility studies, contracting firms and the&#13;
Highway Institute (acting essentially as consultants to the RO) prepare the detailed&#13;
engineering for road projects. In general, they have competent staff and the quality of their&#13;
work is satisfactory.&#13;
2.17         Construction. Road construction and rehabilitation work is normally done&#13;
through unit-priced contracts awarded after competitive bidding. There are four major&#13;
contractors in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia who are capable of handling&#13;
major works and who are active in the international market. The quality of the work is&#13;
generally good but effective site supervision is needed. This supervision is also done by the&#13;
Highway Institute, again acting as consultants to the RO. Except for one exception in the&#13;
past, no prequalified foreign contractor had been successful in submitting the lowest&#13;
responsive bid for Bank financed road projects, during International Competitive Bidding.&#13;
This is due to the very competitive prices of the local contractors.&#13;
2.18         Maintenance. Maintenance of the arterial and regional roads is done by a&#13;
specialized RME, Makedonijapat, with headquarters in Skopje and branches in Bitola, Veles&#13;
and Stip. The Managing Director of the RME reports directly to the Secretary of the RO.&#13;
Maintenance is scheduled according to the financial plan issued by the RO and maintenance&#13;
contracts are awarded annually according to the plan. At present, maintenance priorities are&#13;
determined by inspection, which in a small country has produced acceptable results.&#13;
Introduction of the Pavement Management System (PMS) will put this on an objective and&#13;
scientific basis. The RME is well staffed and equipped. Until recently, maintenance3 of the&#13;
highway network has been satisfactory. However, due to a lack of funds during the last few&#13;
years, the level of maintenance has declined, creating a substantial backlog of pavement&#13;
rehabilitation and strengthening works. Road maintenance capability is high and, with road&#13;
maintenance work carried out by RME separate from, but under contract to the RO, there is&#13;
a measure of accountability and efficiency associated with a contracting relationship.&#13;
3/    The term 'maintenance' includes regular routine, winter, and periodic maintenance including pavement&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
2.19        Before independence, RO was able to obtain assistance with transport&#13;
planning, economic evaluation of investments and many technical matters from federal&#13;
agencies and national advisers. RO now recognizes the need to implant or improve these&#13;
skills within its own organization, in MTC and in MUDCEE in order to incorporate an&#13;
intermodal approach and environmental concerns to investment plans and project design. To&#13;
this end technical assistance under the project would provide training in (i) transport planning&#13;
and feasibility studies; (ii) creation of a highway database including modernized traffic&#13;
counting with weigh-in motion capability; and (iii) creation of a pavement management&#13;
system (PMS) which would lead to (iv) creation of a master maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
program at network level.&#13;
2.20        Technical assistance for all topics except PMS will be provided by individual&#13;
experts coordinated by a specialist firm which will develop lecture and training programs in a&#13;
range of subjects and, as required, introduce necessary software and training in its use.&#13;
Every effort will be made to collaborate with the university and the Highway Institute to&#13;
identify local skills to play as full a part as possible in the training program. By ensuring a&#13;
high level of local participation the expatriate input can be minimized and it is foreseen that&#13;
individual specialists would be in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for a&#13;
minimum period. A separate contract will cover PMS development. The concept is for RO&#13;
to establish a relationship with a specialist PMS company which will help RO to select a&#13;
strategy for PMS development appropriate to a small country and establish an Action Plan.&#13;
Once in place, RO would execute the plan, including the acquisition or hiring of necessary&#13;
equipment with the assistance of the specialist firm at regular intervals, thus maximizing the&#13;
effectiveness of the technical assistance funds (para. 3.9).&#13;
G. Highway Expenditures and Financing&#13;
2.21        Table 2.1 shows road expenditures for the 1992-1994 period and projected&#13;
expenditures for 1995, 1996 and 1997. RO's expenditures on the road network reached a&#13;
peak of US$83.1 million in 1991 and as a result of the country's severe economic crisis,&#13;
dropped to US$29.6 million in 1992. Estimated expenditures for 1994 are still only about&#13;
70% of the 1991 levels, but are expected to recuperate in 1995 and 1996. The stringent&#13;
budgetary constraints mostly affected new road constructions. Allocations for pavement&#13;
strengthening and road maintenance in 1993 were actually above 1991 expenditures,&#13;
reflecting RO's sound policy of giving priority to the protection of existing assets, which are&#13;
shown to have a higher rate or retum. These expenditures, however, are not enough to&#13;
reduce the backlog of strengthening and rehabilitation required by the aging network. In&#13;
1994, estimated expenditures on road construction and reconstruction amounted to about&#13;
US$27.0 million, or about 30% of the total expenditures. Road rehabilitation and pavement&#13;
strengthening represent 45% and maintenance accounts for the remaining 25%. This&#13;
distribution of resources is reasonable considering the existing backlog of works and the need&#13;
to bring the network to maintainable conditions.&#13;
2.22        Road works are fully financed by road user charges which, until January 1,&#13;
1994, were directly deposited in RO's Road Fund. Since then, user charges from fuel are&#13;
transferred to RO through the budget. This change in the flow of funds reflects not only the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Government's attempt to increase the flexibility of public expenditures, but also the decision&#13;
of integrating Transport Sector planning in MTC and MUDCEE. The proposed project is&#13;
supporting these efforts by incorporating MTC and MUDCEE in its training component for&#13;
road planning (para. 3.8). The following table shows the actual and projected percentage&#13;
structure of RO's sources of finance.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
3.1         The East-West corridor links the port of Durres (Albania) with Skopje, Sofia,&#13;
and the port of Burgas in Bulgaria. The need to upgrade the portion of the corridor located&#13;
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to accommodate growing domestic traffic was&#13;
being addressed under the Bank's Third Highway Sector Project for Yugoslavia. The loan&#13;
was approved by the Bank on June 20, 1990 but was cancelled prior to its effectiveness when&#13;
the former Yugoslavia was dissolved. Nevertheless, because of the urgency of the&#13;
investments, the RO went ahead with contracting works in three of the four appraised road&#13;
sections and is financing them with its own budget. Priority sections of the Albanian part of&#13;
the road corridor are being upgraded under the ongoing IDA Credit 2499-ALB, but much of&#13;
the road to Durres will remain in poor condition until financing is available under a proposed&#13;
new IDA credit to Albania in 1996. The proposed loan effectively reinstates the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's participation in the cancelled loan. The proposed project&#13;
has been changed from what had been included in the Third Highway Sector Project to&#13;
address the country's major transport need, which is to provide a link to the outside world&#13;
through its neighbors, Albania and Bulgaria, in the East-West corridor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.2          The project's objectives are:&#13;
(i)   to address the crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
caused by the closure of the Serbian and Greek borders through the&#13;
facilitation of East-West transit so as to reduce transport costs; and&#13;
(ii)   to strengthen the road management capabilities of the RO, MTC and&#13;
MUDCEE, particularly in the areas of planning and pavement&#13;
management.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.3          The project would have three components:&#13;
(i)   the civil works component will improve the country's access to the&#13;
ports of Bulgaria and Albania through the rehabilitation and upgrading&#13;
of about 60 km of the East-West Corridor;&#13;
(ii)   the transit facilitation component will fund technical assistance and&#13;
equipment for the development and implementation of a modern custom&#13;
system; and&#13;
(iii)  the institutional strengthening component will fund technical assistance&#13;
and training to strengthen MTC, MUDCEE and RO in the areas of&#13;
economic evaluation of road investments and life-cost planning for&#13;
PMS.&#13;
D. Engineering and Status of Proiect Preparation&#13;
3.4          Civil works component. The road improvement works were included in the&#13;
Yugoslavia Third Highway Sector Project. The detailed design for the roadworks had been&#13;
completed for that project in accordance with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's&#13;
Highway Design Standards which are satisfactory.4&#13;
3.5          The existing 19 km 2-lane Tetovo - Gostivar road section crosses the fertile&#13;
Polog plain and has 9 at-grade intersections with local roads causing considerable side&#13;
friction and accident potential, thus significantly reducing its capacity. There is considerable&#13;
4/    An increase in design standards took place prior to the date in which the former Yugoslav Republic of o&#13;
Macedonia became a Bank member. The changes in design were subsequently reviewed by the Bank&#13;
and found justified on economic and technical grounds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
congestion and a high accident rate. The 1993 AADT was about 6,600 with 22% trucks and&#13;
buses. Based on an analysis of projected traffic, the design provides for the reconstruction of&#13;
the existing carriageway, the construction of an additional 2-lanes, and treatment of&#13;
intersections, in some cases by grade separation. The original contract in the amount of&#13;
US$17.66 million, was awarded to a firm from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
on the basis of ICB. The design standards were subsequently revised to include the&#13;
additional two lanes and work is proceeding on the basis of the unit prices in the original&#13;
contract. The estimated total cost of this work is now US$26.75 million including&#13;
contingencies, of which US$11.80 million has been expended.&#13;
3.6          The present 40 km 2-lane road from Kichevo to Botun is now the principal&#13;
bottleneck on the M-26 between Skopje and Ohrid, a popular tourist area and the gateway to&#13;
Albania. Because of the poor condition of the pavement over about 31 km of its length, the&#13;
flow of traffic on this section is impeded and the accident rate is high. The 1993 AADT of&#13;
2,830 is projected to grow to 3,500 by 2005 with about 24% trucks and buses. The existing&#13;
road's geometry and width are satisfactory for the design life considered, and the design&#13;
provides for the complete rehabilitation of about 11 km and the overlaying and strengthening&#13;
with asphaltic concrete of about 20 km of pavement, and improvements to shoulders. Works&#13;
were awarded to a firm from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the basis of&#13;
ICB. The total cost including contingencies is now estimated at US$8.47 million of which&#13;
US$5.0 million has been expended.&#13;
3.7         Transit Facilitation Component. In addition to improving the physical&#13;
condition of the road, the Government is taking measures to reduce the waiting time at the&#13;
border crossing points. Border crossings remain a major bottleneck due to a lack of physical&#13;
facilities and equipment and outdated customs procedures. The physical facilities are being&#13;
improved with bilateral funding and the Government's own resources, and the project will&#13;
provide technical assistance and equipment such as computers and software, traffic control&#13;
and communications and control devices. Customs procedures and information management&#13;
will be modernized on the basis of a study carried out by the U.S. Customs Agency in 1993,&#13;
but in line with the EU initiative for improvement of border crossings throughout eastern&#13;
Europe. The IMF is expected to collaborate in implementing those aspects of the program&#13;
related to fiscal issues. The task involves overhauling existing legislation to allow for the&#13;
modernization and selectivity of control procedures, including the approach to physical&#13;
inspection and the gradual introduction of the internationally used Single Administrative&#13;
Document (SAD). The SAD has already been used since January 1, 1994 for goods&#13;
transported to inland customs and for goods in transit. The Government with the support of&#13;
the European Customs Consortium and the U.S. Customs Agency is preparing draft&#13;
legislation to, inter alia, reclassify traded goods to make them consistent with the rest of&#13;
Europe and allow for the increased use of SAD. Also, with technical assistance under the&#13;
project, the Customs Agency will implement ASYCUDA, a widely used computerized&#13;
customs management system developed in Geneva by the United Nations Commission for&#13;
Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The system handles manifests and customs&#13;
declarations, accounting procedures, warehousing and import and export licenses; it also&#13;
generates reliable and timely trade data statistics. The Action Plan for trade facilitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
including the institutional, legal. regulatory. and physical measures to be taken by the&#13;
Government to improve border crossings have been agreed during negotiations&#13;
(para. 5.1 (b!!-&#13;
3.8         Institutional Development Component. In its new relationship with MTC and&#13;
MUDCEE, as agencies of a central government, as opposed to an agency of a small&#13;
constituent republic of a larger federal system, RO has recognized the need to improve its&#13;
planning and management. To this end the project will provide technical assistance and&#13;
training to RO, MTC and MUDCEE in setting up modern transport planning, including the&#13;
establishment of a highway and traffic database and a PMS; updating the guidelines for&#13;
feasibility studies and economic evaluations of investments; and incorporating environmental&#13;
concerns in project design. This component will include: (i) assisting RO in the&#13;
development and installation of a modern PMS; (ii) economic analysis of road rehabilitation&#13;
needs; (iii) the introduction in RO, MTC and MUDCEE of modern transport planning&#13;
techniques, including provision and installation of electronic traffic counters/classifiers, of&#13;
which one-third will have weigh-in motion capability; and (iv) provision of the hardware and&#13;
software, and equipment for collecting data in the field for these systems.&#13;
3.9         The technical assistance and training to be provided under the project would&#13;
require a total of about 40 staff-months of expertise. A senior highway engineer or transport&#13;
economist experienced in the administration of highway departments will be needed&#13;
intermittently for a period of about 20 staff-months to help the RO in highway planning, and&#13;
maintenance management and similar experts for another 20 staff-months for developing the&#13;
PMS. The planning component of the technical assistance will also strengthen MTC's and&#13;
MUDCEE's capabilities for investment planning and project design. Outline Terms of&#13;
Reference and Action Plan for the introduction of the PMS are given in Annex 3. Outline&#13;
TOR for the implementation of the PMS have been agreed with the Government during&#13;
negotiations (para 5.1 (c)).&#13;
E. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.10        Based on September 1994 prices, the estimated total project cost is US$38.70&#13;
million, of which US$24.0 million is the estimated foreign component. The proposed IBRD&#13;
loan of US$24.0 million would cover the whole foreign cost and would be disbursed over a&#13;
four-year period. This is shorter than the standard Bank profile for Highway projects but is&#13;
justified by the unique characteristics of this project, which is already being implemented.&#13;
The costs are summarized in the table below.&#13;

percent per annum, and physical contingencies on Item 2 at 10 percent. Includes all local taxes. Differences due to&#13;
rounding.&#13;
3.11             All costs are quoted in US dollars because of the volatility of the country's&#13;
currency, the Denar. As civil works contracts have already been awarded for the two major&#13;
road works and work is in progress, the current value of the two principal contracts is&#13;
precisely known. Other costs are based on unit rates for technical assistance in the Region&#13;
and similar costs for equipment in PMS installations of this type. However, as the equipment&#13;
needs will emerge from the work done in planning the institutional component with the&#13;
advice of the technical assistance advisors, these amounts should be regarded as budget&#13;
figures only for the time being. Price contingencies have been incorporated based on a US&#13;
dollar inflation of 2.5 percent p.a. The base costs incorporate physical contingencies and all&#13;
local taxes. Local costs include taxes and duties amounting to US$2.8 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F. Project Financing&#13;
3.12        The Borrower will be RO, with onlending to the Customs Agency for the&#13;
transit facilitation component amounting to US$1.7 million. The proposed Bank loan of&#13;
US$24.0 million would finance about 62 percent of the total project cost of US$38.7 million.&#13;
The Government's share will amount to US$14.7 million of which US$6.8 million has&#13;
already been spent. Signature of a Fund Sharing Agreement for transferring loan funds to&#13;
the Customs Agency under terms satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition for loan&#13;
effectiveness (para 5.2 (a)).&#13;
3.13        The proposed financing plan is shown below:&#13;

G. Implementing and Monitoring&#13;
3.14        The RO would be responsible for the execution of the road component of the&#13;
project, with some oversight by MTC and MUDCEE for the planning component. The&#13;
Customs Agency will be responsible for implementing the trade facilitation component. Two&#13;
specialized Government agencies are assisting RO in supervising the two road improvement&#13;
contracts. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established in RO, guided by a&#13;
government appointed steering committee on which RO, MTC, MUDCEE and the Customs&#13;
Agency will be represented, which will assure coordination between agencies. During&#13;
negotiations the Borrower agreed to establish the PIU and maintain it adequately staffed and&#13;
equipped during the life of the Loan (para. 5.1 (d)). Establishment of the PIU and&#13;
appointment of the steering committee will be conditions for Loan Effectiveness (paras. 5.2&#13;
(b) and (c)). The Project Implementation Plan (Annex 4) has been agreed during&#13;
negotiations (para 5. 1 (e)).&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
3.15        Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below. All goods and&#13;
works to be financed from the Bank loan proceeds would be procured in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement, including amendments as of the loan signing date.&#13;
Consulting services would be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency,&#13;
including amendments as of the loan signing date.&#13;

3.16          The two road sections under the project were appraised as part of the Third&#13;
Highway Sector Project, which was canceled prior to its effectiveness (para.3. 1). Bids had&#13;
already been invited prior to loan cancellation. The bidding documents and the&#13;
prequalification procedures were reviewed during preparation of the present project and&#13;
found acceptable. After a detailed review of the history of these two contracts (total value&#13;
US$35.22 million including contingencies), it has been found that all aspects of their bidding,&#13;
contracting and subsequent management have been conducted consistent with the Bank&#13;
guidelines and, therefore, it is proposed that the Bank reimburse RO retroactively for&#13;
expenditures made on these contracts from September 9, 1991 (when the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia became independent). These expenditures amount to 48% of the total&#13;
cost of the contracts (paras. 3.5 and 3.6). The proposed level of retroactive financing would&#13;
amount to 42% of the loan amount and would constitute an exception to the Bank's 10%&#13;
limit. However, because of the unique circumstances surrounding this project, it would not&#13;
set a precedent for future operations.&#13;
3.17          Consultants' services for technical assistance and training (US$1.55 million&#13;
including contingencies) would be carried out by qualified and experienced personnel. The&#13;
selection and employment of consultants will be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants and using the Bank's standard contract form for employment of&#13;
consultants. For preparation of the Pavement Management System (PMS), the Government&#13;
will enter into a contract with a specialist firm which will advise on the introduction of the&#13;
system throughout its preparation period, and selected personnel will visit the country on&#13;
multiple occasions for relatively short periods of time. The contract will provide for an&#13;
initial ten-staff months, and will allow for extension by mutual agreement. For design and&#13;
implementation of the new Customs System, a firm will be engaged on a time-based contract.&#13;
For technical assistance for transport planning, a contract will be signed with a firm, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

will provide lecturers on the range of topics to be included in the program and for on-the job&#13;
training for project evaluation. The firm will be responsible for overall planning of the&#13;
program and for the provision of lecturers and course materials.&#13;
3.18         To date there has been no Country Procurement Assessment, but no LCB is&#13;
foreseen under the project. For execution of procurement during the project, RO will&#13;
establish a Project Implementation Unit including staff with experience in procurement.&#13;
3.19         Vehicles and equipment for pavement testing in the field and computers for&#13;
management systems and trade facilitation (US$0.8 million) will be procured through ICB.&#13;
Manufacturers from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia competing for the&#13;
contracts for the supply of goods procured under ICB would receive a preference of fifteen&#13;
percent of the CIF price or the prevailing customs duty applicable to non-exempt importers,&#13;
whichever is less, provided the Guideline requirements for eligibility for domestic preference&#13;
are met. International Shopping (IS), based on comparison of price quotations obtained from&#13;
at least three suppliers from three eligible countries, would be used for procurement of&#13;
specialized equipment for pavement management estimated to cost less than US$100,000 with&#13;
an aggregate limit of US$520,000.&#13;
3.20         All contracts for goods and works estimated to cost more than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent, and contracts for technical assistance and consultancy services valued in excess of&#13;
US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals would be subject to prior Bank review.&#13;
Also, terms of reference for all technical assistance and consultancy contracts would be&#13;
reviewed in advance by the Bank. The balance of contracts for equipment would be subject&#13;
to ex-post review. Agreement to the above procurement arrangements (paras. 3.17 - 3,20)&#13;
was reached during negotiations (para. 5.1 (g)).&#13;

3.22         Because of the special circumstances of the project's early history (para. 3.16),&#13;
retroactive financing in an amount of US$10 million would be provided to cover the&#13;
expenditures made after the date of signature of the Tetovo - Gostivar and Kicevo - Botun&#13;
road contracts, which took place after the date of the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Macedonia's independence, September 9, 1991. Disbursements for contracts for civil works,&#13;
goods and services above the contract value of US$100,000 equivalent (US$50,000 for&#13;
individual consultants) would be fully documented. All other contracts would be disbursed&#13;
against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The supporting documentation would be retained&#13;
by the PIU and be made available for review by Bank supervision missions. To facilitate&#13;
payments from the loan, a Special Account will be established at a commercial bank in&#13;
Skopje that is acceptable to the Bank, which will be managed by RO. The account will have&#13;
a maximum size of US$1.4 million, referred to in the Loan Agreement as the Authorized&#13;
Allocation, but until the pace of activity on the project justifies a balance of this size, defined&#13;
as when the total of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the value of any Special&#13;
Commitments made against the Loan are equal to US$12 million, the maximum balance in&#13;
the Special Account shall be US$0.7 million. Applications for replenishment of the special&#13;
account would be submitted on a quarterly basis or when 1/3 of the amount deposited has&#13;
been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. In addition to documentation requirement stated&#13;
above, each replenishment application would be supported by monthly bank statements of the&#13;
special account which have been reconciled by the PIU. All other applications for direct&#13;
payments or Special Commitments must be for an amount not less than 20% of the special&#13;
account deposit. Retroactive payments shall be made exclusively for expenditures under the&#13;
two civil works contracts and only for certified expenditures subsequent to September 9,&#13;
1991, the date of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's independence.  During&#13;
negotiations. agreement has been reached on the establishment of the Special Account&#13;
(para. 5.1 (f)).&#13;
3.23        The Closing Date of the Bank Loan would be June 30, 1999. A Disbursement&#13;
Schedule is shown in Annex 5. This is consistent with the relevant historical profile for the&#13;
Region, adjusted for the actual start date of construction.&#13;
J. Project Supervision and Reporting&#13;
3.24        The Borrower has successfully implemented five previous Bank projects, so&#13;
two missions a year totaling about eight staff weeks will provide adequate field supervision.&#13;
A further six weeks annually are expected to be required for procurement, monitoring, and&#13;
reporting in Washington. The RO will submit a report at the end of each quarter, showing&#13;
progress in all components and providing details of all procurement activities.&#13;
K. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.25        The project has been classified as "B" for purposes of O.D. 4.01. The civil&#13;
works are mostly confined to improvements within existing rights of way. There would be no&#13;
population resettlement nor would the project affect any known archaeological or historical&#13;
site. The longitudinal and cross drainage for the roads are properly engineered to eliminate&#13;
the possibility of soil erosion. The improved horizontal and vertical alignments, and in the&#13;
case of Tetovo-Gostivar, the greater capacity and redesigned intersections, are expected to&#13;
greatly reduce accidents. Under clauses in their contracts, the contractors are legally&#13;
responsible for maintaining work sites pollution free, restoring ground conditions to their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
original state and equipping asphalt plants with dust collectors. They are also legally bound&#13;
to report to the RO if they encounter historical remains. An environmental analysis of the&#13;
civil works made during appraisal, confirmed the adequacy of the mitigating measures being&#13;
implemented. The analysis recommended noise screening for six houses which would now&#13;
be closer to the edge of the widened road, which has been accepted by RO even though the&#13;
houses were illegally built.&#13;
3.26         In order to increase awareness of the potential environmental problems from&#13;
road projects, the technical assistance for planning would include a course for engineers&#13;
covering "The Environmental Aspects of Road Design and Construction". In addition, the&#13;
revision of the feasibility study guidelines would ensure the inclusion of an acceptable&#13;
Environmental Assessment process in the study of road investments.&#13;
L. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.27         Separate accounts would be used to record all expenditures from project funds,&#13;
both Government and Loan funds. These accounts, including any SOEs, as well as the&#13;
Special Account would be audited each year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
During negotiations the Government agreed to have the accounts of the project audited and to&#13;
forward the audit report to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year (para&#13;
5.1 (h)).&#13;
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries&#13;
4.1          The proposed project would improve the efficiency of the road transport sector&#13;
by reducing overall transport costs. Quantifiable benefits will be in the form of vehicle&#13;
operating cost (VOC) savings, i.e., lower fuel consumption, tire wear and general vehicle&#13;
maintenance costs, and time and wage savings. Also, the present value of estimated future&#13;
road expenditures will be reduced by avoiding more expensive interventions at a later date.&#13;
4.2          The benefits would accrue to a large and widespread number of beneficiaries.&#13;
Lower road transport costs and time savings will benefit vehicle owners as well as users.&#13;
Private users such as individual car owners, bus passengers and own account transporters&#13;
will capture benefits directly. In the case of trucking and intercity bus services, the benefits&#13;
accrue first to vehicle owners, but are expected to be passed to producers and consumers in&#13;
the form of lower freight rates and fares, given the competitive nature of the road transport&#13;
industry in the country.&#13;
B. Cost and Benefits&#13;
4.3          Feasibility studies for the works in the Tetovo-Gostivar and Kichevo-Botun&#13;
roads were prepared by a local consulting firm following methodologies developed in 1973&#13;
with Bank assistance under the previous loans to the former Republic of Yugoslavia and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
updated in 1994. All costs and benefits were evaluated in constant 1994 prices. Financial&#13;
costs and prices have been converted to economic prices. Traffic growth rates for the&#13;
Tetovo-Gostivar road have been estimated at 4.3% p.a. until 1996 and 1.1 % thereafter for&#13;
private vehicles; about 1.1% p.a. for buses and 3.9% p.a. for freight vehicles. In the case&#13;
of the Kichevo-Botun road, there were similar growth rate assumptions, except that bus&#13;
traffic was also expected to grow at about 4% p.a. VOC's were calculated as a function of&#13;
velocity and subsequently adjusted according to estimates made using the Bank's HDM&#13;
model in countries with similar characteristics.&#13;
4.4          The economic rates of return (ERR) for the investments in the Tetovo-Gostivar&#13;
and Kichevo-Botun roads are 18% and 23% respectively. The economic viability of the road&#13;
works is not dependent on the continued interruption of North-South transit. The economic&#13;
benefits of the Tetovo-Gostivar capacity expansion, was carried-out with a base traffic of&#13;
6900 vehicles per day, a level that was already attained in 1983, when the road served only&#13;
domestic traffic. Traffic declined to about 4000 vehicles per day in 1992 and recuperated to&#13;
an AADT of about 6900 in 1993. To a great extent, traffic growth in the last few years can&#13;
be attributed to the rapid growth of motorization (para. 2.5), and to the opening up of&#13;
communications with Albania and Bulgaria. Freight vehicles account for 14% of the total&#13;
traffic, of which it would be highly unlikely that more than 50% would be diverted to North-&#13;
South connections once the country's situation goes back to normal. In this scenario, the&#13;
IRR for the Tetovo-Gostivar road works would drop to 14%. This is a very conservative&#13;
estimate of the economic viability of the project, since a resumption of the economic activity&#13;
to the levels of the early 80s would more than offset the impact of traffic diversion and&#13;
increase the benefits of the project by about 50%. In the case of the Kichevo-Botun road,&#13;
traffic diversion would reduce the ERR from 23% to 20%. Table 4.1 presents the costs and&#13;
benefits of the road works. Feasibility studies for the road works will be entered in the&#13;
project file.&#13;
4.5          Although the benefits from developing and implementing a Pavement&#13;
Management System are difficult to quantify, the introduction to the RO of tools to optimize&#13;
the allocation of resources throughout the life of the road, is expected to result in substantial&#13;
savings in road maintenance.&#13;
C. Overall Evaluation and Risks&#13;
4.6          The project does not present any technical or environmental risks. The main&#13;
risk is related to the fragile political and economic situation, which may impact the&#13;
availability of counterpart funds. That risk, however, is within acceptable levels because of&#13;
the high priority of the road works, the historic financial independence and solvency of RO,&#13;
the small share that the proposed investments represent in RO's budget (less than 10%), and&#13;
the amount of retroactive financing proposed for the project. There are also risks related to&#13;
the possible lack of coordination among the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,&#13;
Albania and Bulgaria, but the present framework of consultation and coordination under the&#13;
auspices of the G-24 group and the EU, provides sufficient assurances on the commitment of&#13;
these countries to improve border crossings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.1          During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following matters:&#13;
(a) that RO shall not carry out investments for the expansion, upgrading and&#13;
maintenance of its road network unless it has been established, that such&#13;
investments are economically viable and environmentally sound, on the&#13;
basis of criteria and guidelines satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.14);.&#13;
(b) the Action Plan for Trade Facilitation (para. 3.7);&#13;
(c) outline TOR for PMS (para. 3.9);&#13;
(d) staffing of PIU (para 3.14);&#13;
(e) the Project Implementation Plan (para. 3. 14);&#13;
(f) the Establishment of the Special Account (para. 3.22);&#13;
(g) procurement arrangements (para. 3.20);&#13;
(h) account and audits (para. 3.27)&#13;
5.2          Prior to loan effectiveness:&#13;
(a) the Borrower and the Government should sign a Fund Sharing Agreement,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, for the implementation of the transit facilitation&#13;
component (para. 3. 12).&#13;
(b) the Borrower should establish the PIU with staffing and equipment&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.14);&#13;
(c) the Government should appoint the steering committee with&#13;
representatives of RO, MUDCEE and the Customs Agency (para. 3.14);&#13;
and&#13;
5.3         The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank Loan to the&#13;
Republican Road Organization with the guarantee of the Government of the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia in the amount of US$24.0 million at the standard variable interest&#13;
rate for a period of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, with repayments calculated&#13;
on an annuity basis.&#13;

TRANSIT FACILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Past Bank Assistance to the Sector&#13;
1.          The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia received 13 loans for the&#13;
highway sub-sector (11 highway projects and two highway sector projects). A T'hird&#13;
Highway Sector Project was cancelled in 1991 due for the break-up of Yugoslavia. The&#13;
initial appraisal of road sections included in the project, under the normal traffic conditions,&#13;
was performed as part of the appraisal of the Third Highway Sector project. The studies&#13;
were later up-dated (July 1994) to establish project feasibility with the changed traffic flow,&#13;
resulting from the closing of the southern border by Greece and the UN trade sanctions&#13;
against former Yugoslavia. The following paragraphs list past Banks Assistance which&#13;
included elements located in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.&#13;
2.          The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia benefitted from the Third&#13;
Highway Project (Loan 608-YU, US$ 30 million), financed in 1969, which comprised about&#13;
120 km of roads in Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, and was completed in August 1974&#13;
with a 20 month delay, primarily due to delays in completing an access road. This project&#13;
had an 8% cost overrun due to inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The Fifth&#13;
Highway Project (Loan 751-YU, US$35 million)comprised 153 km of roads in Kosovo,&#13;
Macedonia and Slovenia, procurement of US$1.7 million worth of engineering equipment,&#13;
consultant's services and a staff training component to improve highway planning and project&#13;
preparation. The project was completed by the end of 1977, with a delay of 15 months and&#13;
costs overrun of 8%. The Eight Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU), US$56 million) was&#13;
made in 1977. The project comprised about 130 km of roads in Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,&#13;
Macedonia and Kosovo. The road works were completed and the loan closed in 1981.&#13;
3.          The loan for the Tenth Highway Project (Loan 1678-YU, US$148 million) was&#13;
made in April 1979 and became effective in August 1979. It comprised the first phase three-&#13;
year tranche (from mid-1979 to mid-1982) of the 1979-85 highway sector programs of five&#13;
participating Republics and Provinces. Although progress was variable among the borrowers,&#13;
most construction contracts suffered delays of one to two years due to a shortage of local&#13;
funds. Construction was essentially completed by mid-1984, but the loan closing date was&#13;
postponed to June 30, 1985, to allow for completion of the training component and&#13;
procurement of equipment. The project also included an updating of the Road User Charges&#13;
Study, financed under the Eighth Highway Project. The loan for the Eleventh Highway&#13;
Project (Loan 1819-YU, US$125 million) was made in April 1980 and became effective in&#13;
August 1980. It comprised construction of six sections of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (THY)&#13;
with controlled access facility in four Republics and Provinces, including Macedonia, totalling&#13;
&#13;

about 164 km, and the procurement of highway maintenance and road monitoring equipment,&#13;
technical assistance, a highway safety program and the preparation of a Toll Study. Although&#13;
execution was delayed by up to two years because of the shortage of local funds, most&#13;
construction items were completed by the revised loan closing date of June 30, 1985. The&#13;
Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were both implemented during a period of economic&#13;
difficulty and budgetary reductions. Because of the severe shortage of local funds, both the&#13;
Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were included under the Bank's Special Action. Program&#13;
in mid-1983. The investment plans were revised, and the projects were then implemented as&#13;
planned, albeit with a two year delay. Re-estimated economic returns for both projects were&#13;
satisfactory. Several institutional improvements were incorporated in the project including the&#13;
creation of a coordinating body for roads at the federal level (FARP), the carrying out of a&#13;
road user charges study, and training.&#13;

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
TRANSIT FACILITATION PROJECT&#13;
The Trucking Industry&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           Before 1989, most of the trucks were assigned to a few large vertically integrated&#13;
organizations. The trucking industry was heavily regulated through various laws, which limited&#13;
the participation of the private sector. In that year, a national privatization law was passed,&#13;
liberalizing the trucking industry by abolishing barriers to entry of private sector operators,&#13;
allowing international competition, and eliminating favorable tax rates for social sector&#13;
enterprises.  Public organizations became then social sector enterprises in the process of&#13;
privatization. Additionally, in 1991 the Macedonian Railways, which used to possess their own&#13;
road transport fleet from the "combined" (intermodal) transport activities, created four social&#13;
sector trucking enterprises.&#13;
Organization of the Trucking Industry&#13;
2.           Currently, the trucking industry is organized as follows: (a) social sector&#13;
enterprises; (b) own-account trucking; and (c) private sector operators.&#13;
a)    Social sector enterprises are self managed and receive no subsidies from&#13;
the state.  Since 1989, they are all in the transition to full private&#13;
ownership, for which they must present privatization proposals to the state&#13;
by the end of 1994. There are a few exceptions for the three largest&#13;
trucking enterprises, that are allowed until the end of 1995 to present their&#13;
privatization plans.&#13;
b)    Own-account trucking refers to trucking  fleets owned by specific&#13;
industries.  Most of the own-account trucking is performed by the&#13;
construction and agricultural sectors.  There are about 2,500 trucks&#13;
operating for the construction industry. Agricultural trucks are mainly&#13;
small trucks (2-5 ton), which are used to carry fresh produce to the&#13;
market.&#13;
c)    Private sector operators comprise both companies and individuals and&#13;
compete both with the social sector enterprises and with own account&#13;
trucking.&#13;

Trucking Associations and International Trucking&#13;
4.          There is only one trucking association, which also groups the international road&#13;
transporters, the Macedonia Soobrakaj (Association of Macedonian Enterprises for Road&#13;
International Transport - AMERIT). There 80 member firms in the association of which&#13;
approximately half are private and the other half are social sector enterprises in the process of&#13;
privatization.&#13;
5.          AMERIT is a member of the International Road Transport Union (IRU), based&#13;
in Geneva, and is the agency that issues the "Transport International Routiere" (TIR) certificates&#13;
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. There are a total of 500 TIR certificates in the&#13;
country, awarded to firms and individuals, which includes members and no-members of&#13;
AMERIT. This accounts for about 7,000 TIR trucks.&#13;
Regulations&#13;
o.          In 1989 the Government of the Former Yugoslavia passed a privatization law,&#13;
affecting several sectors of the economy, including transport. The Government of the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continued with these reforms, which are currently in place.&#13;
They include: permitting the private sector to operate internationally and foreign trucks to&#13;
operate inside the country, reducing tariffs and removing regulations on importing foreign&#13;
vehicles; equalizing tax rates and enforcement between social sector enterprises and private&#13;
sector operators; improving accounting rules to allow for depreciation; and separating the&#13;
accounts of trucking and bus subsidiaries which were owned by the railways, so they do not&#13;
benefit from the subsidies which railways received in the past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 8&#13;
7.           The Government is still working on other issues so as to improve the efficiency&#13;
of the trucking sector such as completing the privatization of social sector firms; training road&#13;
operators in modem management practices; increasing vehicle leasing arrangements; introducing&#13;
a computer-based freight information system; and publicizing the merits of a market based road&#13;
transport industry among decision makers&#13;
Technical Inspection and Average Age&#13;
8.           Technical inspection of motor vehicles (trucks, car, buses, etc.) is performed by&#13;
the Auto Moto Union of Macedonia (AMSM). Trucks and buses are required to do yearly safety&#13;
checks. The average age of the trucking fleet is nine years. It is estimated that 90% of the&#13;
trucking fleet is manufactured in western Europe mainly Scania (Sweden), Mercedes Benz&#13;
(Germany) and Fiat (Italy). The remaining 10%, is comprised of Raba (Hungary) and Skoda&#13;
(Czech Republic) trucks.&#13;
Duties and Taxes&#13;
9.           Social sector enterprises and private operators must equally pay a 25 % customs&#13;
duty, on the vehicle value, to import trucks or any other types of vehicle. However, if the&#13;
importers are registered as international carriers, they are exempted of rendering the customs&#13;
duty. For importing spare parts, the duty is 5 % for own use of a transport enterprise, and 25 %&#13;
when the parts will be traded. The trucking industry is levied a 10% tax on the transport service&#13;
they perform, equally for social and private enterprises. Additionally, they must pay a 30%&#13;
income tax like all Macedonian enterprises.&#13;
Role of Trucking in the Economy&#13;
10.         Trucking activity in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was severely&#13;
hampered over the last few years by the breakup of Yugoslavia, the blockade of Serbia, and the&#13;
border closing with Greece. This is reflected in Tables 2 and 3, which show the evolution of&#13;
the goods transported during the period 1988-1992. Total cargo transported decreased from 11&#13;
million tons to 4 million tons, and ton-kilometers from 2,450 million to 1,424 million. During&#13;
the same period, there was a shift of main products carried (para. 11), which is a consequence&#13;
of the situation of the industrial sector in the country. Additionally, there was a modification&#13;
in the geographic pattern of freight, from the traditional North-South direction connecting Greece&#13;
to the rest of former Yugoslavia, to the East-West linking with Albania and Bulgaria.&#13;

11.           Lime, cement and other mineral products transported decreased by 70%  during&#13;
1988-1992, even though they still accounted for a 24.4% of total goods carried. Metals and&#13;
metal products were the second group of products carried with 22.2% in 1988, but its volume&#13;
decrease to 6.7% in 1992. Petroleum and petroleum products was the third group of products&#13;
transported in 1988 accounting for 8.3%, becoming the second in 1992 with 12.9%. However,&#13;
considering ton-kilometers, petroleum and petroleum products were the first good in 1992 with&#13;
17.6%. This also shows the higher distance traveled for these commodities. Tables 4 and 5&#13;
show the evolution of freight volumes for the different types of goods.&#13;

Current Situation and Main Issues&#13;
13.         Estimates for 1994 indicate that road haulage continued to decline to nearly half&#13;
of the freight volumes of 1992, about 2 million tons, of which 90% is international transport and&#13;
the remaining 10% is domestic transport. Petroleum is the main good carried; mainly from the&#13;
port of Burgas in Bulgaria. Fresh fruits and vegetables are not being carried by Macedonian&#13;
truckers due to the spoilage produced by extensive waits at the borders and, to the lack of&#13;
refrigerated trucks.  There is an excess demand for transporting wine and vegetable oil&#13;
internationally. However, since the interruption of oil imports from the railway served port of&#13;
Salonike, all the cistern tanks are being used for carrying petroleum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 8 of 8&#13;
14.         Truckers and shippers agree about the major concerns of the road freight activity&#13;
in the country. They can be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Long delays at the border crossings with Bulgaria (Deve Bair) and Albania&#13;
(Cafasan). This situation has reduced the truck turn-around time by 60%. For&#13;
example, a truck could make the trip Skopje-Burgas-Skopje (1,400 Kin) 10 times&#13;
per month. With the present conditions, truckers make 4-5 trips per month.&#13;
(b)   Bulgarian trucks charge lower fees than Macedonian trucks for certain types of&#13;
freight, due to lower fuel prices in Bulgaria (53% lower than in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), and the utilization of an older trucking fleet&#13;
(20 years average age) which belonged to the Bulgarian army&#13;
(c)   Discontinuing of the railway service has diminished the demand for "combined"&#13;
and container transport, feeding the main rail lines especially for domestic&#13;
distribution purposes.&#13;
(d)   Renewal of the trucking fleet is critical if Macedonian truckers want to compete&#13;
internationally. Investments would be needed to acquire new equipment such as&#13;
containers, refrigerated containers, and to refurbish freight transport terminals.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
ROADS ORGANIZATION&#13;
PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
Outline Terms of Reference for Pavement Management System&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia has been independent of the former&#13;
Yugoslavia since September 1991. As a member of the federation, the former Yugoslav Republic&#13;
of Macedonia was included in various federally-run systems, including systems maintained or&#13;
being put into place by the Association of Road Organizations of Yugoslavia. The independent&#13;
Roads Organization of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (RO) now wishes to put in&#13;
place its own nation-wide pavement management system (PMS). The country is a landlocked&#13;
rectangular territory approximately 220 km by 150 km, bordered by Serbia, Greece, Albania and&#13;
Bulgaria. RO has responsibility for 2600 km of paved roads including 104 km of motorway, 811&#13;
km of primary roads, and 500 km of earth and gravel roads. These are administered from the&#13;
Headquarters in Skopje through three regional directorates. RO also works closely with the&#13;
university and two engineering design institutes. In considering the pool of staff available to&#13;
work with, the university and institutes may be included on a par with RO staff. Two large&#13;
contractors maintain small consulting capabilities.&#13;
THE CONCEPT&#13;
2.    As there is no previous experience of PMS in the country, and as the country is small,&#13;
RO wishes to develop a PMS with the following characteristics:&#13;
(i)   it shall be simple, with an emphasis on creating a tool for investment and&#13;
maintenance decision makers as soon as possible, but capable of adaptation to&#13;
greater sophistication later;&#13;
(ii)  it shall make maximum use of existing systems and software already on the world&#13;
market;&#13;
(iii)  it shall make maximum use of manpower and resources of the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia;&#13;
(iv)  it should require the ownership and maintenance of a minimum amount of&#13;
specialized equipment, and instead maximize the use of data gathering by&#13;
contracted services or rented equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.    The Roads Organization is currently negotiating a loan from the World Bank and intends&#13;
to use part of the proceeds for purchase of the equipment and services necessary for the&#13;
introduction of a PMS. RO invites proposals from the shortlisted firms specializing in the&#13;
development and installation of pavement management systems. The consultant should&#13;
familiarize himself with the state of PMS development in adjacent but larger countries, who have&#13;
acquired or will be acquiring their own instrumentation, and which may be sources of&#13;
contracting out data collection, or equipment rental.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
4.    The selected firm will be expected to visit the country, review the road network, and in&#13;
consultation with RO, make recommendations for the introduction of an appropriate PMS, and,&#13;
after discussion and agreement on the final action plan, assist RO with its implementation. The&#13;
recommendations will include:&#13;
(i)   the broad outline of the system proposed, software to be adopted, adapted, or&#13;
written, for database, pavement performance, VOC module, determination of&#13;
maintenance strategy etc; and hardware.&#13;
(ii)   a Plan of Action and timetable for the development and installation of the system,&#13;
which shall include training of personnel, and installation of location referencing&#13;
system points.&#13;
(iii) a detailed list of equipment and software to be purchased, and eventually,&#13;
preparation of bidding documents for its purchase.&#13;
(iv)   a list of personnel, facilities and equipment to be provided by RO at no cost to&#13;
the consultant.&#13;
THE TASK&#13;
5.    In keeping with the Government's wish to make maximum use of its own talent and&#13;
manpower, the selected firm is expected to minimize the time that its own personnel are in the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to manage the assignment through a series of visits&#13;
over a 2-3 year period, each of which would be triggered by completion of a specified task, such&#13;
as delivery of an item of equipment, or completion of installation of LRP's.&#13;
THE WORLD BANK LOAN.&#13;
6.    The World Bank loan is expected to be available in mid 1995; a budget of $1 million is&#13;
earmarked for equipment, technical assistance and contracted services, and the loan is expected&#13;
to close in June 1999.&#13;

TRANSIT FACILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (PIP)&#13;
PrJect Objectives&#13;
1.    The project objectives are:&#13;
(i)   to address the crisis created for transport in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia caused by actions on the Serbian and Greek borders, through the&#13;
facilitation of East-West transit and reducing transport costs through road&#13;
rehabilitation;&#13;
(ii)  to strengthen the road management capabilities of MTC, MUDCEE and RO,&#13;
particularly in the areas of planning and pavement management.&#13;
2.    The project would have three components:&#13;
(i)   the civil works component will improve the country's access to the ports of&#13;
Bulgaria and Albania through the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 60 kmn&#13;
of the East-West Corridor;&#13;
(ii)  the transit facilitation component will fund technical assistance and equipment&#13;
for the development and implementation of a modem customs system, and for&#13;
the monitoring of performance targets for transit times; and&#13;
(iii) the institutional strengthening component will fund technical assistance and&#13;
training for strengthening MTC, MUDCEE and RO in the areas of economic&#13;
evaluation of road investments and pavement management (PMS).&#13;
3.    The project will be implemented by the Road Organization, an independent agency&#13;
with its own earmarked funding sources, subject to loose oversight from MTC, and&#13;
MUDCEE, and by the Customs Agency. Before independence RO implemented the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's components of at five highway projects, and the&#13;
organization is an experienced borrower. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU). staffed at&#13;
least by an engineer and an accountant. will be constituted. There will also be a steering&#13;
committee with representation for RO, MTC, MUDCEE, and the Customs Agency&#13;
overseeing the whole project and responsible for coordination between agencies. Creation of&#13;
the PIU and appointment of the committee are conditions for loan effectiveness. RO will be&#13;
&#13;

The Borrower, and the Secretary, who is appointed by, and responsible to Parliament, is&#13;
empowered to sign any contracts for commitment of loan funds.&#13;
4.    The PIP is given in a series of tables attached to this annex. Table 1 shows the tasks,&#13;
their inter-relation one with the other, and their timing. Tables 2,3 and 4 provide details of&#13;
the implementation of the transit facilitation component. The project cost&#13;
table and disbursement table are given in the SAR in para 3.10 and Annex 5; items eligible&#13;
for funding from the loan are shown in the disbursement method table in para 3.15.&#13;
5.    Auditors will be appointed in late 1995, in time to prepare and submit a report on&#13;
financial year 1995 by June 1996.&#13;
6.    Feasibility analyses. including the economic evaluation of road works in Tetovo-&#13;
Gostivar and Kichevo-Botun will be entered in the Project File.&#13;
7.    Monitoring will be the task of the PIU. The two civil works contracts are ongoing&#13;
and each has a contractual completion date, which serve as an indicator. Quality and works&#13;
progress will be monitored by RO's resident engineer. The PMS program development&#13;
begins with the establishment of an Action Plan with milestones. When these milestones&#13;
have been established, they will serve as monitoring indicators. They will be events rather&#13;
than dates, and will monitor equipment delivery and key points in system development.&#13;

            Macedonia - Transit Facilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Transit
            Facilitation Project are to assist the Government to: 1)
            address the crisis created for transport in the former
            Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia caused by the closure of the
            Serbian and Greek borders, through the facilitation of
            East-West transport so as to reduce transport costs; and 2)
            strengthen the road management capabilities of the Ministry
            of Transport and Communications, the Ministry of Urban
            Development (MTC), Civil Engineering, and Environment
            (MUDCEE), and the Republican Road Organization (RO) of the
            former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The project will have
            three components: 1) the civil works component will improve
            the country's access to the ports of Bulgaria and
            Albania through the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 60
            km of the East-West Corridor; 2) the transit facilitation
            component will fund technical assistance and equipment for
            the development and implementation of a modern customs
            system and the improvement of transit times; and 3) the
            institutional strengthening component will fund technical
            assistance and training to strengthen MTC, MUDCEE and RO in
            the area of economic evaluation of different road
            interventions and life-cost planning for pavement management.
