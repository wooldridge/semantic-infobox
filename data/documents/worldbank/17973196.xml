BECKER: Good morning. Today is Wednesday, April 30th, 2008. This is&#13;
Bill Becker with the World Bank Oral History Project and The George&#13;
Washington University. And I'm here today to interview Daniel R. Gross.&#13;
So, Mr. Gross, it's very nice to see you, Dr. Gross.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Thank you very much. It's a pleasure ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. to be here.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Very good. Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
I'm going to start with some obvious and easy questions. When and where&#13;
were you born?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I was born in New York City, Brooklyn to be specific, in October&#13;
1942.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Very good. And if I may ask, what did your father do for&#13;
a living?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: My entire family-father, mother, sister-were all social workers.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Social workers. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Un-huh.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Very good. Now, from my research, I find that you wept from&#13;
New York to Atlanta.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So, so what part of your youth was spent in Atlanta?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Daniel Gross&#13;
                           April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, most of my early childhood, from the age of four onward until I&#13;
was 17, when I went to college.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see. I see. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you say your family were social workers. Did that have some influence&#13;
on your interest, one, in anthropology, or later, in development issues?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I suppose it did, although I don't know if it was a direct influence&#13;
or it was indirect, because I started out in college as a music major, and then&#13;
I decided I wanted to be a philosophy major.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This is University of Chicago?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. at the U. of C., and then I really fell into anthropology as a&#13;
discipline almost by accident.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I was in the strange position of having a fellowship to use for my&#13;
undergraduate education, but no place to use it. So I took the advice of a&#13;
friend and decided to go into anthropology, and that was the way I got&#13;
involved in it. But I find that actually I've done quite a bit of things, quite a&#13;
number of things that in some ways mimic part of my father's career.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now, your major at Chicago-I'm showing off here my research .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. was in philosophy?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So, you did-did you take much anthropology at Chicago?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No, very little.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Daniel Gross&#13;

&amp;#12;                                         3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Very little.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Very little; yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Just-I took the minimum required in social sciences, and that&#13;
included some anthropology.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Okay. And so you went to Columbia for your ..&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: For graduate work.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. Ph.D.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. in anthropology. Were there members of the faculty-or first&#13;
of all, at Chicago, who later influenced your interest. You said a friend. I&#13;
don't know if that was a fellow student or a .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It was one of my .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. a faculty.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. childhood friends .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. a friend I had grown up with in Atlanta, who was studying&#13;
anthropology. And he suggested that I try anthropology, since I was in this&#13;
funny situation of having a very nice national fellowship.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And it turned out to have been a good suggestion.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: A good choice.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Obviously.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;

&amp;#12;                                           4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So who did you work with at Columbia?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: At Columbia, I think the major influence on my thinking and my&#13;
career was a man named-the late Marvin Harris. And Harris, who is best&#13;
known to anthropologists as the author of a very well known book on the&#13;
history of anthropological theory and also a number of books and articles on&#13;
a wide variety of topics, where he took on-he took a particular theoretical&#13;
approach, which was-he later called it cultural materialism, and there was&#13;
some basis of his approach in Marxism, but there was also a lot of&#13;
neoclassical economics.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: He never admitted to that, but that-it was the case. And,&#13;
basically, his view was that people make decisions rationally and adaptively.&#13;
A lot of things that may appear to be irrational are actually-can actually be&#13;
understood in rational terms if one understands the context properly. So he&#13;
had-he did a very interesting, and it turned out to be influential, study on&#13;
sacred cattle in India, for example, where he showed that the doctrine of not&#13;
slaughtering cattle was actually, from an ecological perspective and from the&#13;
perspective of adaptation, was really beneficial. It was a better use of that&#13;
resource than to slaughter cattle for meat. That study was later extended and&#13;
corroborated by a number of other studies, and people now regard it as a kind&#13;
of a landmark.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Did this influence your work on your ..&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:     .. dissertation?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, very heavily.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Now, how did you select the subject, which was on Brazil,&#13;
I guess?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How did that come about?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Well, Marvin Harris and Charles Wagley, who was Harris' mentor,&#13;
were both my teachers at Columbia. Both of them had done extensive&#13;
research in Brazil. I had the opportunity early in my graduate career to go to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Daniel Gross&#13;
                               Apri/30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          5&#13;
&#13;
Brazil. I visited an area in the northeast which fascinated me because of the&#13;
history of violence, which had occurred mostly in the 19th century and which&#13;
seemed to be somehow related to the environment, which is an environment in&#13;
which there are periodic draughts. And just I was really quite interested in&#13;
that and that history. So, I decided-I had decided to select a topic in that&#13;
area.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And I did. I went to northeastern Brazil, and I spent about six&#13;
months touring the entire region, and I finally settled in one particular&#13;
community for nearly a year, where I lived in a small village with&#13;
agricultural producers. And that's where I learned to speak Portuguese&#13;
fluently. I began to understand how people thought and how people&#13;
considered things, and it had a huge influence on my life.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Okay. So your dissertation was on violence and .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No, it wasn't. It was really on economic change. It was on the&#13;
introduction of a new crop, which occurred during the 1950s. I was there&#13;
during the late '60s, and so I was able to see some of the impact of this crop&#13;
introduction, both positive and negative. And my dissertation was on that&#13;
topic.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see. Now, were these people indigenous people?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No.&#13;
&#13;
BEKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No. These are people who are descendants of the three major&#13;
groups that form the Brazilian population, which is some indigenous people,&#13;
Africans and Europeans.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So there were peopl         t was really a mixture.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Un-huh.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: They all were Portuguese speakers, and they had-they were not-&#13;
you could not identify them as any one of those three groups in terms of their&#13;
ongtn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You could call them peasants, if you want.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. The indigenous people I guess are in the southeast?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No, they're all over the country.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: They're-oh, are they?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yeah. There's only one state in Brazil that has no indigenous&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see. I see. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yeah. No, there's a lot of indigenous people who live in the&#13;
Amazon region in the north, and then there's-there are indigenous people&#13;
scattered really in all the other states in Brazil with one exception.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So out of the 27 states, 26 have indigenous people.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what brought your interest-when did you become interested in&#13;
indigenous peoples?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, that was a little bit later on. I had done some reading and some&#13;
papers in graduate school on indigenous peoples, and particularly on a group&#13;
or a-really a group of you could call them tribes in Brazil who speak&#13;
languages which are part of the Ge language family. I was fascinated by&#13;
some aspects of their social organization. So during the '70s, I began doing&#13;
more reading, and then I organized a field team which went to Brazil. There&#13;
were three American graduate students and one Brazilian, each of whom spent&#13;
a year living in a tribal society in Brazil, all of whom were Ge speakers, and&#13;
we carried out a comparative study jointly. During that time, I was a visiting&#13;
professor at the University of Brasilia.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So, I was able to go and visit them in the field and actually take at&#13;
least three out of the four into the field. I had a very good experience of&#13;
working with a team, which is unusual for anthropologists, who tend to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loners, and also to work in these four different indigenous villages.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Okay. I moved you ahead in the chronology.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That's okay.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So after graduation, you were obviously looking for a job. And&#13;
you went to Hunter College or-there first?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That's right. Yes. When I finished graduate school, I had two job&#13;
opportunities, and the one in New York seemed to be the most interesting,&#13;
and it was also-1 was recently married, so I thought-my wife had-I had&#13;
met my wife in Brazil. So it seemed to be a better choice from that&#13;
perspective, too, because it wouldn't mean another transition to another&#13;
place. The other job opportunity was actually in Canada. So I decided to&#13;
accept the job at Hunter, and I was on the faculty at Hunter for 19 years.&#13;
Although I spent a number of those years on sabbatical leave or on leave to-&#13;
during the time I was a visiting professor in Brasilia, and then I spent two&#13;
years here in Washington at the National Science Foundation, where I had a&#13;
rotating post in the anthropology program.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Now, what was the focus of your teaching and research&#13;
while you were at Hunter?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It was largely on topics related to my research, which I think you&#13;
could broadly call human ecology. And my interest is-has been for really&#13;
most of my career--on interactions between human populations and the&#13;
natural and the built environment. I found that there's an end less set of&#13;
questions, interesting questions, which are, I think, relevant to our current&#13;
conditions, which arise out of that interest.&#13;
&#13;
So, I did research, for example, on the nutritional-the impact of nutrition,&#13;
diet and nutrition on behavior, on how people organize themselves. And the&#13;
work that I'm best known for in anthropology, i     'm not exactly a&#13;
household word, but the work that, you know, work-articles that have been&#13;
reprinted fairly frequently and used in teaching have been articles along those&#13;
lines, along ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. dealing with human behavior and diet and nutrition.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hunter is part of the City University.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So did you have doctoral students?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes. I had the opportunity to teach undergraduates, masters&#13;
students, and doctoral students. The doctoral program at City University is a&#13;
combined, which combines faculty from all nine of the senior colleges in the&#13;
system. So I was on the doctoral faculty and taught a number of doctoral&#13;
students.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Are there any of them that stand out, I mean, you ended up collaborating with&#13;
or ... ?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Absolutely. One of them is Nancy Flowers, who-she's about 90.&#13;
She started her graduate work when she was in her 50s. Nancy has really&#13;
distinguished herself as an ethnographer, as a photographer, and also as an&#13;
expert in human ecology, dealing with the relationship between, I guess,&#13;
mainly between disease and behavior in a particular society, which is the&#13;
Xvante society of Central Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Nancy was part of my field team back in the '70s ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. and she wrote her dissertation under my supervision. I was on&#13;
her committee.&#13;
&#13;
Another favorite student, Lucile Brockway, who is, in a way, very similar&#13;
because she's a woman who started her career fairly late, after having had&#13;
seven children. And she had a short career because she died, unfortunately,&#13;
not very long after she finished her Ph.D. But she produced a book, which&#13;
has become a kind of standard text, which was based on her doctoral&#13;
dissertation. The book was called Science and Colonial Expansion&#13;
[Brockway, Lucile H. Science and Colonial Expansion: The Role of the&#13;
British Royal Botanic Gardens (Studies in Social Discontinuity). Academic&#13;
Press, 1979].&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Brockway studied the role of Kew Gardens in the expansion of the&#13;
British Empire.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Huh.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: She was able to show that Kew Gardens was not just a place where&#13;
they collected interesting flowers and catalogued different kind of palm trees,&#13;
but it actually was a major research and development institution in its time,&#13;
and it permitted the transplanting of important economic crops, such as&#13;
cinchona-the source of quinine-that allowed the British to-to colonize&#13;
Africa, which would not otherwise have been possible without quinine&#13;
because of the malaria.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Brockway also studied rubber, which the British transplanted from&#13;
its native habitat in Brazil and the Amazon region to Malaya, which is now&#13;
Malaysia, and which made possible, to a large extent, the Industrial&#13;
Revolution. So she was able to show the significance of Kew Gardens in the&#13;
expansion of the British colonial empire. Her book, Science and Colonial&#13;
Expansion is-someone referred to it recently in an article in The New Yorker&#13;
as a classic [Seabrook, John. "Sowing For Apocalypse- The Quest for a&#13;
Global Seed Bank." The New Yorker. August 27, 2007].&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, really? Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yeah. So I was very gratified to see that, and I was just sorry that&#13;
Lucille was not able to see her book referred to in those terms.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in the course of your academic career, did you consult for&#13;
the UN, or did you consult for the, you know, for the World Bank, for&#13;
instance?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Relatively late in my academic career, when I was actually a&#13;
professor and was busy doing the things that professors do-getting grants,&#13;
writing papers, giving papers at meetings, and teaching--! began consulting.&#13;
And I did work with three or four agencies, mainly consulting firms working&#13;
under contract to U SAID [U.S. Agency for international Development], the&#13;
Inter-American Development Bank, and then the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And then there were sort of odd things here and there. I did a lot of&#13;
consulting for publishers, particularly Harper &amp; Row. At that time the&#13;
anthropology editor was someone I got to know fairly well, and he relied on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
me quite a bit to give a first screening of manuscripts or book ideas that he&#13;
received.&#13;
&#13;
So that was very interesting to me. That was very use'ful because it expanded&#13;
my horizons beyond, you know, the focus of my own research, to look at&#13;
people were doing on other topics in sometimes different regions of the world&#13;
or different things that I had really not been-I hadn't done much work on. I&#13;
used a lot of my general knowledge to write a textbook called Discovering&#13;
Anthropology [Gross, Daniel R. Discovering Anthropology. McGraw-Hill&#13;
Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages, 1992].&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, you also said that you had a grant, and you spent two years&#13;
in Washington with the National Science Foundation.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When was that?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That was 19-mmm. I think it was from '83 to '85, if I'm not&#13;
mistaken.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what were your responsibilities for NSF?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I was the program officer for Cultural and Social Anthropology,&#13;
which meant that I was responsible for the review of grant proposals, and I&#13;
would convene a review panel twice a year for the two years that I had that&#13;
job. We would also get peer reviewers, ad hoc peerÂ·reviewers, to review each&#13;
proposal, usually five or six reviewers, and the panel would review them all&#13;
at once at a meeting and rank them. And then I would be responsible for&#13;
determining the final size of the grant and sometimes making some relatively&#13;
small changes within the ranking depending on various factors.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Well, following that, you went back to teaching .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I went back to teaching .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. and research.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. for another-well, I had a sabbatical year, and then I had another&#13;
year of teaching, and then I made a decision that I had had a very rich career&#13;
as an academic and a professor. I had enjoyed it very much. I had another&#13;
couple of job offers that-in academic institutions, but I decided that I really&#13;
wanted to do something different. So I changed careers, against the advice of&#13;
most of my colleagues. I was-at that time, I was tenured and was a full&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                             April 30, 2008-Fina/ Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
professor, so they all said, "You're crazy."&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: But I just had this idea I wanted to make a change. So I became an&#13;
independent consultant, and I was consulting then more heavily for the Bank&#13;
and other agencies when I received an offer sometime in '89 to become a&#13;
long-term consultant for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: At that point, there was something called the long-term consultant.&#13;
So I accepted that, and then, I think, in December of '90, I was offered a&#13;
regular position, a staff position in the Bank. And I accepted that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in the consulting, what kinds of things for the Bank or for&#13;
some of these other agencies, what kind of questions were you retained to&#13;
deal with?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I was dealing mainly with, I guess, questions, economic change&#13;
issues. I did-1 worked with a team doing a study of fishing, fisheries in&#13;
the-in Cape Verde, for example. I did a study on rural roads in Guatemala,&#13;
which was a fascinating piece of work there. But Guatemala really stands out&#13;
in my mind.&#13;
&#13;
I did some work on an IDB [Inter-American Development Bank]-a drainage&#13;
project in the city of Bel em in the State of Parana in Brazil, which I was&#13;
dealing mainly with the impact of this drainage project on the poor people&#13;
who live in these stilt houses perched over areas that were flooded every day&#13;
at high tide, and which-it's not very well known, but there were these-&#13;
there was large areas of the city were occupied by these stilt house-this stilt&#13;
housing, and really only about 20 percent of the area of the city was dry land&#13;
all the time, because of the very low elevation.&#13;
&#13;
And they built-they developed a drainage system under this project, which it&#13;
actually took another 20 years to materialize-but from the time that I&#13;
worked on it, it opened up a huge area of the city of Belem. And my concern&#13;
at that point was to ensure that the people who lived there would not be the&#13;
victims of real estate speculation. So that's the kind of work I did during&#13;
that time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when you came to the Bank as a regular employee starting in 1990,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        12&#13;
&#13;
where were you assigned?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I was assigned to the-I was-my entire career in the Bank was in&#13;
Latin America. I was assigned to the Brazil Department, and particularly to&#13;
the Agriculture Division [Latin America and the Caribbean Country&#13;
Department I, Agriculture Operations Division], and I think the main thing&#13;
that I was asked to do-which then I gradually branched out into other&#13;
areas-but was to work with indigenous peoples issues. And they were&#13;
particularly hot at that time, because the Bank was still involved in the&#13;
financing of projects in the north-so-called Northwest Amazon. I say so-&#13;
called because it's really the Western Amazon. It's not northwest at all. The&#13;
Northwest Amazon is up there near Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: But it became known as Northwest, and the name stuck.&#13;
&#13;
But the Bank was involved from '81 onward in financing projects in that&#13;
region, in the states of Rondonia and Mato Grosso particularly. The Bank&#13;
became involved in the financing of a paved highway-paving of a highway-&#13;
and then four more projects, which had other objectives-one was a health&#13;
project, and so on-and there were indigenous people all over this region, and&#13;
I was asked to become involved in that.                   Â·&#13;
&#13;
After a hiatus, the Bank began to finance a new set of projects in the late&#13;
'80s, which really didn't come into-they weren't actually approved until&#13;
about '92. But these projects were-and to some extent, these were of sort of&#13;
considered to be reparations for damage that Bank financing had allegedly&#13;
done in the region earlier with the roads project. A great deal was made&#13;
about that, about the so-called Polonoroeste projects. We referred to it as a&#13;
"program," because it included five separate investment projects. You know,&#13;
the Bank has a special way of saying everything.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And so it was a-it was a set of five projects, and, therefore, it was&#13;
baptized as a program. And there were-it had some programmatic aspects to&#13;
it, and there was an integrated set of projects. But those projects became&#13;
infamous in the environmental world as a giant mistake the Bank had made,&#13;
as having caused damage, as having opened up that region to colonization and&#13;
destroyed large areas of forest and harmed indigenous people.&#13;
&#13;
There was a Jot of misinformation involved in those criticisms and those&#13;
critiques, but Barber [B.] Conable, I think, made the mistake of saying that-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;
                            April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
he used some language like, "Well, there's some projects we're not so proud&#13;
of, such as the Polonoroeste project"-because the criticism was so&#13;
widespread, and it had become notorious, .and to this day Polonoroeste is&#13;
regarded as the Bank's donnybrook, the worst thing the Bank ever did, you&#13;
know, from the environmental and social perspective.&#13;
&#13;
Through my eyes, in my view-and not very many other people share this&#13;
even inside the Bank-those projects were far from disasters. They did a lot&#13;
of good. They did a lot of good in a situation where the alternative-no&#13;
project-would have been much worse. I'm absolutely convinced of that.&#13;
&#13;
So, I think most of the things that happened that were adverse, that were not&#13;
good things, would have happened to a much greater degree-it would have&#13;
been much more serious or adverse consequences, impacts of the colonization&#13;
of that area.&#13;
&#13;
And I can go into that if you'd like, because I think it's quite important,&#13;
something that had a great deal of influence on policies and directions that&#13;
the Bank took subsequently. That's when the Bank began getting very&#13;
serious about safeguard policies. It tried to develop policies that would&#13;
prevent the adverse impacts that the project-that those Polonoroeste projects&#13;
had, and those were the so-called safeguard policies that we have now. We&#13;
have ten safeguard policies, which are designed to prevent the-I insist on&#13;
saying-the alleged kinds of harm that the Bank did, because I don't really&#13;
feel that the Bank's projects had that much harmful effect, and I think that, in&#13;
fact, there were many beneficial impacts, the most important of which was to&#13;
have avoided even more serious harm to people and to the environment.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The-so how many years did you spend on this? You started in&#13;
'90, so ..&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right. I worked on those projects for a good five or six years.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Un-huh.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It was never my only focus. In '92 I was actually kind of surprised&#13;
that I was asked to be the-become the task manager of a relatively new&#13;
project that was almost dead in the water called the National Environmental&#13;
Project in Brazil. And I've built a lot of my career in the Bank on a basis of&#13;
that project.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And it's actually now in a third generation. You know, we're&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
preparing a third generation of it now, working on the team. I'm no longer&#13;
the task team leader. But I was task manager of the Brazil National&#13;
Environmental Project from '92 through my retirement in 2004.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what did that entail? Is that to work with civil society?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That project was designed to be a project that would strengthen&#13;
Brazil's capacity to deal with environment, and mostly at a federal level.&#13;
And it was aimed mainly at the so-called green environment. A big chunk of&#13;
it was designed to protect-help protect conservation-protected areas all over&#13;
Brazil-federal protected areas. And gradually, through a series of changes&#13;
that we introduced-in '94 there was a fairly significant amendment made to&#13;
the project agreement. The project became decentralized, and it was&#13;
focused-it began to focus much more on state-level environmental&#13;
protection. And today, it's entirely decentralized. It's no longer focused on&#13;
federal agencies and federal protected areas.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Why did they decide to go with that project?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Well,       there was a general policy for decentralization that had really&#13;
begun in Brazil    during the military period when they decided that they needed&#13;
to decentralize.    Brazil is a large country, and centralized policy-making and&#13;
implementation     have not worked well.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It's a federal republic. The capacity of the federal government to&#13;
manage and administer issues having to do with health, education, transport,&#13;
urban transport, housing, and so on, which had been centralized in the federal&#13;
government during the early years of the military government, from the .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: '60s.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. mid-'60s onward they began to realize the capacity of the federal&#13;
government was quite limited; that they could set policies, they could finance&#13;
things, but they really didn't have the means to design and finance and&#13;
implement projects and activities in all those areas, in all those sectors. It&#13;
also was something that was financially non-viable. There was just-there&#13;
never was enough money in the federal budget to finance so many activities.&#13;
For example, at one point the federal government was financing urban&#13;
transport all over the country. There was an agency that would finance bus&#13;
systems, trains-urban commuter trains and so on--and which had some&#13;
success and so, but it was just too little too late.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Daniel Gross&#13;
                               April 30, 2008-Fina/ Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So I think it was partly on that realization there were a lot of things&#13;
that just couldn't be managed from the federal level. And environment was&#13;
included in that. And very slowly, the federal government understood and&#13;
began to act on this understanding.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what about the Bank's role? I guess that at this time the&#13;
Bank is still at this time required to make sovereign loans. So were the loans&#13;
made to the federal government, which then decided how to parcel them out&#13;
to the states?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: The First National Environmental Project, yes. The first loans that&#13;
were made that were-and this is now speaking generally, not.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. just about the National Environmental Project-were made to&#13;
be-to the federal government, which were then distributed to states. Later,&#13;
states, well, became eligible to borrow from the Bank, with a sovereign&#13;
guarantee.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And so there's still a number of loans that are open that-where the&#13;
federal government gives its guarantee, but the state is responsible for the&#13;
loan, and for amortizing the loan, also.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the Bank has embarked, with the approval of the Brazilian government,&#13;
on a new round of lending to states, in which there is no sovereign guarantee,&#13;
in which the states that are considered credit worthy are able to borrow&#13;
directly from the Bank. And the Bank has also begun lending to&#13;
municipalities, but a sovereign guarantee is required. So the Bank has really&#13;
moved fairly aggressively into this area in some countries where there's a&#13;
fairly stable economy and where there are some sub-national units-states or&#13;
provinces-that are credit worthy, and that are capable of taking on debt.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, how does the Bank go about trying to deal with&#13;
environmental problems? That's a very big question, but, I mean, from your&#13;
purview and from the kinds of projects you were involved in.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm. Well, I think-well, first of all, I think that there was-&#13;
first of all, there was a very-particularly with regard to Brazil, but I think&#13;
this is true of other countries as well-there was a very strong emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Fina/ Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
green environment and relatively little on industrial environments that were&#13;
affected by industry and by urban development, urban growth, so that the&#13;
Bank was concerned very much with the Amazon region of Brazil, with the&#13;
deforestation, and that's reflected in the first National Environmental Project,&#13;
where a great deal of the activity was focused on the rural environment .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. green environment. And a lot of money was earmarked for&#13;
conservation units for federal parks and reserves. It turned out that they did&#13;
not have the capacity to absorb anywhere near the amount of money that had&#13;
been earmarked in the loan for that purpose.&#13;
&#13;
Another aspect of the Bank's approach to environment was that it started out&#13;
very much with a do-no-harm kind of philosophy, that we're not-we're&#13;
going to avoid causing damage, as opposed to we're going to try to enhance&#13;
the Bank's impact on environment. We're going to try to ensure that not only&#13;
do we not do harm, but we actually do good with our environmental lending,&#13;
or our projects that involve environment.&#13;
&#13;
The other big event that was occurring back then in the '80s was a heightened&#13;
concern with the issue of resettlement. And so that became, along with the&#13;
issue of deforestation and the destruction of rain forest in places like&#13;
Indonesia and West Africa and South America, the issue of resettlement&#13;
became very salient, and then-and that was also based on events that were&#13;
occurring in Brazil and India and, to some extent, in Africa .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. These are related to dam projects?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Dams. Dam projects most often. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Although there are some other projects--such as big coal project,&#13;
for example, in India--that had a lot of resettlement involved and which&#13;
became very controversial and subject to Inspection Panel requests. But the&#13;
Bank became very concerned with resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
And then I think that these things almost merged, in terms of concern for&#13;
them and-and they converged on the idea that the Bank was doing harm, the&#13;
Bank was causing havoc in some places. And some heroes arose in the Bank,&#13;
like Michael [M.] Cernea on the issue of resettlement and Bob [Robert J.]&#13;
Goodland; they're both key, very pivotal, characters, and now Herman [E.]&#13;
Daly, the economist, who I think is now at the University of Maryland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And these were people who took strong, some might even say&#13;
radical, positions about the Bank. But they had a lot of influence. A fourth Â·&#13;
one would be Shelton [H.] Davis. So-and these people worked together in&#13;
the same department for a while. Shelton Davis, Herman Daly, Bob&#13;
Goodland, and Michael Cernea, they become the conscience-they became the&#13;
conscience of the Bank. They became the watchdogs, each one with a&#13;
particular issue in mind: Daly with-on the general issue of environment,&#13;
and the dilemma of growth and harm to the environment; Shelton Davis, on&#13;
the issue of indigenous people; Michael Cernea on the issue of resettlement;&#13;
and Bob Goodland on the issue of tropical forests more than anything else.&#13;
And this related to-a lot to their own individual experience. Sandy Davis&#13;
had come out of an NGO activity. He was a one-man NGO, actually, for&#13;
many years. And he had something called the Anthropology Resume Center.&#13;
A-R-C.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And he published a newsletter, and he was kind of a muckraker, and&#13;
then he was recruited in the Bank to help develop the Bank's first indigenous&#13;
peoples policy back in the early '80s. Goodland was involved in the&#13;
development of an environmental assessment policy. Cernea was involved in&#13;
the development of the Bank's resettlement policy.&#13;
&#13;
And so these men were-and, you know, from the perspective of the Bank,&#13;
they were-I call them heroes or giants. They all had flaws ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. like most giants do. But they had a major influence. And they&#13;
started from a position of do no harm, and they helped develop policies, and&#13;
they did a certain amount of internal policing.&#13;
&#13;
At one point, I had-there was a group that I have since called "Cernea's&#13;
Raiders." They actually went into the Bank's information system-the&#13;
records were available, were accessible, and they would do things like comb&#13;
through Bank hydropower projects and look for any evidence that there were&#13;
resettlement problems.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And what they found was that, looking back into the '70s and '80s,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Daniel Gross&#13;
                            April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that there were projects the Bank was financing where there was either an&#13;
unknown amount of resettlement, or it was mentioned but nothing was done&#13;
about it, you know, where the Bank was financing projects which involved&#13;
the displacement of hundreds or thousands of people without taking any&#13;
special precautions.&#13;
&#13;
Cernea developed some statistics in which he suggested that there were&#13;
hundreds of thousands or millions of people around the world who were&#13;
displaced by development projects, and the Bank was part of the problem.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: About what year was this that they went through it?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I think it was in the-it was in the early to mid '80s.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: People like-Scott [E.] Guggenheim was involved in that. He was&#13;
one of the raiders. Maritta [R. V. B.] Koch-Weser, 'who was-who later&#13;
became a director .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. in the Bank, was also involved in that, and there were-I think&#13;
who else may have been involved; I think Maninder [S.] Gill, who is now a&#13;
sector manager in the Bank-and all of them had a great impact.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. How did this go over in the Bank? I mean ...&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, there was a lot of resentment.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This is [Alden Winship "Tom"] Clausen and Conable's period, I&#13;
guess. Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes. Right. There was resentment. There was consternation.&#13;
There was a feeling that this represented a kind of intrusion in the Bank by&#13;
non-qualified people who were not interested in development but in pushing&#13;
their own social agendas. There was quite a bit of resistance to that. Of&#13;
course, these people, I don't think any of them was directly linked to the&#13;
NGO world while they were in the Bank, but they had a lot of support from&#13;
NGOs around the world, you know, but particularly in developed countries,&#13;
particularly groups in the U.S. and U.K. and to a lesser extent in the rest of&#13;
Europe.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So what you're saying is that what comes out of this is the notion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;

&amp;#12;                                        19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank that you do no harm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Would you say that that's the upshot of their efforts?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes. Absolutely. The-I think all of the safeguard policies that&#13;
the Bank now has in place are policies that basically come out of the do-no-&#13;
harm philosophy.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Now, was this your philosophy when you took over this program in Brazil on&#13;
the environment, or had it moved-had the notion of do no harm moved to&#13;
something else, of being more proactive in promoting environmentalism on&#13;
the ground?&#13;

BECKER: We were talking about the Bank ..&#13;

BECKER: .. and driving .&#13;

GROSS: Right. Right.&#13;
&#13;

precautions. Do you see in the kind of work that you were doing with the-&#13;
with your job, did you become something of an iconoclast in the way you&#13;
looked at this?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, I think I started out that way. I was all-1 was never very&#13;
much of an organization man.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                        ---------&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        20&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Now, the interesting thing about these people who I just referred to&#13;
is that all of them were to some extent-I'm not sure I'd call them&#13;
iconoclasts, but they were people who were willing to buck the system and to&#13;
really look at development from another perspective. But there were two&#13;
aspects of the environment that I think that really can't be neglected to&#13;
understand what they were doing. First of all, management was willing to&#13;
have these people inside under the roof of the Bank, and I think that they&#13;
perceived that that would probably be better than having people outside, you&#13;
know, taking potshots at the Bank all the time. And, in fact, people like&#13;
Goodland and Sandy Davis are widely admired by people outside the Bank as&#13;
having been people who were in the Bank but who resisted a lot of what they&#13;
feel is the Bank's foibles and mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
The other aspect is something that is-that there was the rise of powerful,&#13;
organized NGOs, like the Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund, Oxfam, and&#13;
Environmental Defense-which at that point was the Environmental Defense&#13;
Fund-and so on, that were staunch critics of the Bank, and they enlisted&#13;
people like members of legislatures in-certainly in Great Britain and in the&#13;
U.S. and to some extent in Germany and France, and these are our biggest&#13;
donors, you know, that we can't live without. Â·&#13;
&#13;
So I think in a-to some extent management's-management was responding&#13;
to something that was out there that they could only ignore at their peril. I&#13;
think that in that respect the managers understood better than some staff&#13;
members that there was a risk that the Bank faced that, you know, some of the&#13;
issues and areas where the Bank needed the support of its members, and&#13;
particularly its Part I members, that it had better start paying heed to these&#13;
external critics.&#13;
&#13;
So one way of doing that was to have people in the Bank who were dealing&#13;
with these issues, who might themselves have other views than, let's say, the&#13;
mainstream view of the Bank, which is basically a kind of a, you know, an&#13;
economist's view, kind of neoclassical economic view, you know, and a&#13;
devotion to growth. 1 think now there's a much more nuanced view in the&#13;
Bank. But not everyone shares it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Now, would you say the change came with [James D.] Wolfensohn, who was&#13;
   .     ?&#13;
or Is ....&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No. It came before Wolfensohn.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It picks up before Wolfensohn.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                         21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes, for sure. For sure. No, that was-you know, for example, the&#13;
rise of these heroes, or if you want to call them iconoclasts or, you know,&#13;
people who were-had a different perspective, comes way before Wolfensohn&#13;
joined the Bank. And you might even say they had more influence then than&#13;
now, than after Wolfensohn came.&#13;
&#13;
Wolfensohn, I think, put emphasis on some things. He, for example, after&#13;
Western China-there was the famous Western China affair [Qinghai Project,&#13;
a component of the proposed China Western Poverty Reduction Project],&#13;
which was almost like Polonoroeste in the sense that it was blown way out of&#13;
proportion, you know-that Congresswoman from Georgia [Cynthia A.&#13;
McKinney], who referred in many speeches and pronouncements to the Bank's&#13;
investments in Tibet. They weren't in Tibet. They were in China, although&#13;
they did affect ethnic Tibetans inside the traditional boundaries of China.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And, you know, I was kind of surprised, in fact, that the-that the&#13;
Bank always let that go by, you know, without correction, you know. But&#13;
those investments were made in China.&#13;
&#13;
And another point is that those investments were made-they were-the one&#13;
that created the furor was actually the fourth or fifth operation of its kind,&#13;
which involved quite a bit of migration of Han Chinese into an area which&#13;
was not predominantly but substantially inhabited by people of Tibetan&#13;
ethnicity now, you know, which is not to say that that ethnicity shouldn't&#13;
have been taken into consideration. It should have. It was a mistake. We&#13;
were wrong not to haveÂ· considered it. But the nature of what happened and&#13;
the harm that was allegedly done and so on has been blown out of&#13;
proportion ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. by the critics.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Let me take you back to something that you said, and that I&#13;
wanted to follow up on .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. and that is the role of anthropologists in the Bank (and I meant&#13;
to ask this when we first started talking about your coming to the Bank).&#13;
What was the state of anthropology, or anthropologists, in the Bank when you&#13;
&#13;

                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        22&#13;
&#13;
came to the Bank? And what is the history of anthropologists and an&#13;
anthropological perspective&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm. Well, that's something that-since I wasn't here, you&#13;
know, from the early '80s ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. I can't speak authoritatively about, but at the point I joined the&#13;
Bank, there were probably a dozen or so anthropologists and maybe four or&#13;
five dozen non-economist social scientists in the Bank. There were people&#13;
who'd been in the Bank for some time. There were people like Gloria Davis&#13;
and Scott Guggenheim and some people whose names I've forgotten.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, were they anthropologists?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: They are anthropologists. Scott Guggenheim .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, all right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. and Gloria Davis both have Ph.D.'s in anthropology. And the-&#13;
Gloria-! should say the late Gloria Davis, who actually founded the social&#13;
development department in the Bank. There were relatively few. They were&#13;
partly the product of a campaign that Michael Cernea waged to bring social-&#13;
non-economist social scientists into the Bank. Cernea wanted to bring in&#13;
people of high caliber, and he did, I think, to large extent he did that.&#13;
&#13;
He believed that bringing non-economists, social science into the Bank would&#13;
humanize the Bank, would make it more responsive to the issues that were&#13;
being raised, the criticisms that were being raised on resettlement and&#13;
indigenous peoples and on a host of other issues which are social issues but&#13;
which don't have a convenient label like resettlement and indigenous people.&#13;
But there are plenty of cases where there are important social issues which&#13;
one has to pay attention to, which Michael believed that having social&#13;
scientists in the Bank would greatly improve the situation.&#13;
&#13;
I think probably his expectation was a little bit too high because I don't think&#13;
Michael had a-you know, fully realized the degree to which the Bank can&#13;
co-opt people and the degree to which people, you know, found themselves&#13;
overwhelmed. Many, if not most of the social scientists in the Bank-and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;
                             Apri/30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
this is still the case-are fairly junior. I think more than half of the social&#13;
scientists in the Bank are not on regular contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Now, junior people don't have as much fire power, and they can't be as bold&#13;
as people who are on regular contracts and more senior people. And this is&#13;
one thing I found in the Bank that I don't think it's unique to the Bank, but&#13;
the Bank is a-as a corporate culture, it respects age and experience quite a&#13;
bit. You know, I can say things now in meetings that I couldn't say back&#13;
when I was a young 4 7 -year-old whippersnapper.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: If you can believe there's such a thing as a 47-year-old&#13;
whippersnapper, but ...&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, comparatively speaking.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Relatively-everything is relative.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: But, no, I mean, now I find that there's a certain-there's a certain&#13;
respect for age and experience as well as rank in the Bank, and so these&#13;
younger people who Michael, I think, was, more than any other single person,&#13;
was instrumental in bringing into the Bank, a lot of them are people who are&#13;
relatively junior and who can, you know, are, like everybody in any&#13;
organization, they are vulnerable. They're subject to being co-opted or&#13;
convinced, you know, not to be quite so radical and so on.&#13;
&#13;
And I think every single person who comes into the Bank, with the possible&#13;
exception of Michael Cernea himself, has made some kind of accommodation:&#13;
that they might have been very much iconoclasts outside the Bank; when they&#13;
joined the Bank, they realized they were part of a very big organism, that&#13;
they could not simply stand up and fight and tilt at windmi lis. They couldn't&#13;
be Don Quixotes here in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, was there a champion somewhere up the line for social&#13;
scientists in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mmm. Something-you mean an upper-level official?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah, the upper-you know, that pushed this, or was&#13;
sympathetic?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                        24&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: The only one who comes to mind right off hand would be-he was a&#13;
vice president of the Bank; he's retired now. He's now the head of the&#13;
Alexandria Library. [M.] Ismail Serageldin.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: He was from-the champion of the NGOs and the relations ...&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right. And I think he was also champion, to some extent, of social&#13;
science in the Bank and environmentalism in the Bank. I'm trying to think of&#13;
anyone else who I can think of.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, what about Koch-Weser?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Maritta Koch-Weser. Well, she was fairly junior. She was-you&#13;
know, when she was working with Cernea, she as a consultant, and then she&#13;
Â· oined the-she oined as a staff member robabl in around '86 or '87.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But she was sympathetic?&#13;
                                                                       NOV 06 2012&#13;
                                                                             ~4      ',     .__&#13;
                                                                  Exception C Â· t' ~ 1.&lt;--lc..;y '&#13;
GROSS: She's an anthropologist. She has a Ph.D. in anthropology.                  ~~~-L&#13;
BECKER: Yeah, that's what I was going to say. She's one of the people I&#13;
had in mind.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So she was a champion of anthropology?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: But not as much as the other four that I've mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The others you've mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Not nearly as much. No, she came later, and she surfed on that&#13;
wave, but she was not as nearly as much as a pioneer as Cernea, you know.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One of the reasons ...&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And I'll say all of this about Cernea, you know-and I'll say this&#13;
openly-Cernea is not a Mr. Nice Guy. And I think maybe he might have&#13;
even been more effective if had been a little bit more diplomatic. But Cernea&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;
                            April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
is the guy who did, I think, more than any other single individual bring social&#13;
science into the Bank. And as I say, senior management, if they didn't&#13;
always like what he did and how he did it, they realized they needed someone&#13;
like him in the Bank because of the mounting pressure that was coming from&#13;
outside.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The reason I asked this question is that one of the themes that has&#13;
developed-I've been doing this for 13 years-one of the themes more in the&#13;
last few years is that the change of the culture to a much more economics&#13;
orientation was at the expense of the technical people ..&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right. Engineers, foresters, health and education specialists.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What about the social scientists? I mean, they were there, you&#13;
know, they were there, too. Did you ever have difficulty with economists qua&#13;
economists?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, yes. Sure. No, I've had-you know, all of us who work as&#13;
social scientists in the Bank have had some fun events, you know. And one&#13;
of the things is that, to this day, I review a lot of project proposals for the&#13;
Safeguards Advisory Team. It's a nice way of keeping up with what's going&#13;
on, because I look at different projects. We have lots of development policy&#13;
loans-DPLs-still, where the only objective is growth.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And that's it. You know, there's no-not even lip service paid to&#13;
the quality of growth or to the distributive effects of growth. The idea is that&#13;
growth is good all by itself and it needs no justification or qualification.&#13;
&#13;
So that's still right there, you know, and we confront that all of the time.&#13;
And we need to, I think, particularly those of us who have acquired enough&#13;
stature where we can stand up in a meeting and say something is amiss, we&#13;
can bring these things to people's attention and get away with it, as it were.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You know, and I've-personally, and I can't speak that well for&#13;
other people, but I can certainly speak for myself--is I've had situations&#13;
where clearly there were social issues that were being neglected or&#13;
downplayed and where I could come up with something that was, you know,&#13;
that was of significance, that should have been paid attention to.&#13;
&#13;
There was one occasion that I-just to give an example--where the Bank was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;

&#13;
preparing a development policy loan in Brazil that involved fiscal reform.&#13;
And there was a very good analysis of the fiscal policy in Brazil, in which&#13;
one of the conclusions was that taxation was regressive; that is, the poor paid&#13;
more taxes than the rich, relative to their income. So, you know, then it went&#13;
on to talk about, you know, fine tuning this and making that better and&#13;
getting better information to this from this to that, you know, with the usual&#13;
sort of policy recommendations or conditions that are attached to these DPLs.&#13;
&#13;
And I was-1 remember being at a meeting where the task manager, who had&#13;
written this really very impressive project document, was there and the vice&#13;
president was there; it was David de Ferranti at the time. I asked why is&#13;
there-why aren't we on the side of a more progressive tax policy and why&#13;
should we be supporting a tax policy which is basically regressive or which&#13;
is, however slightly, tilted in favor of the wealthy. And, you know, there was&#13;
this silence, you know, and then de Ferranti said, "He's got a point." That's,&#13;
I think, the kind of influence that one can have. I don't think it made a huge&#13;
difference, but I think that, you know, they certainly had to do some&#13;
rewriting and re-thinking.&#13;
&#13;
And that's happened to me a number of times where I've come in on a&#13;
situation, usually too late. It's very rare that social scientists are called in&#13;
far enough upstream in projects, and sometimes these are huge projects. This&#13;
was a $500 million DPL where social scientists who might be concerned with&#13;
the things like distributive effects and distributive impacts, about minority&#13;
groups and about participation and issues that economists don't deal with.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now ...&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Not all economists do. You know, there's-they're ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: No. No. Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. there are some economists who are much more with it, I think, as&#13;
far as these issues.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you said that while you were working on this project, which you've&#13;
been working on through 2004 .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. you were doing other things.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now what other things were you-what are some of the other&#13;
things you were doing?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Well, I was participating in a lot of task teams that-where the&#13;
issue of environment-of indigenous peoples was a factor, and resettlement&#13;
was a factor. So I worked on a number of projects, and I was task manager of&#13;
a number of projects where there were indigenous issues and resettlement&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what are the main indigenous people issues?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Land.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You could say land, land, and land. Consultation. You know, what&#13;
the Bank has now come to say "meaningful" consultation, whatever that&#13;
means, you know, but where-and that's very tricky because a task team&#13;
leader will say, "Well, we had a meeting with some indigenous leaders, and&#13;
they said they're in favor of the project, and so we're home free."&#13;
&#13;
And a social scientist might say, "Well, yes. But, I mean, there are some&#13;
dissidents who may not be considered leaders by, you know, by the&#13;
government people you were dealing with, who maybe should be heard from,&#13;
too. Or maybe there needs to be some meetings out in villages, where not&#13;
just the so-called leaders, who are sometimes fairly autocratic and&#13;
patriarchal, that-where women are not heard from, you know, you should be&#13;
consulting at that level as well."&#13;
&#13;
And they say, "Well, you know, there are hundreds of villages. Well, yeah,&#13;
we can just-we can go to a few to test public opinion." So, that's the kind&#13;
of-those are some of the things that I would do as a team member or, in&#13;
some cases, as a task manager.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the indigenous peoples have different languages than Portuguese?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: In Brazil? Yes. There are hundreds of languages. In the Xavante,&#13;
for example, most adult Xavante men speak Portuguese. Relatively few&#13;
Xavante women do. The only ones who do are some older women who at&#13;
some point worked as servants, house servants. But the rest of the women are&#13;

                                         28&#13;
&#13;
basically monolingual in Xavante.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So, that's a situation you run into in, oh, in Mexico and. in&#13;
Argentina, in Venezuela, in Peru. You have Peru-well, all the Andean&#13;
countries where-you know, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia-where&#13;
you have large communities that are substantially monolingual in Quechua or&#13;
Aymara.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Now, as part of your teams, do you have people who can speak some of these&#13;
languages?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Well, one of my perennial recommendations is bring in someone&#13;
who can speak the indigenous language in an individual case. We just-1 just&#13;
participated in a project, you know, I was kind of brought in at the last&#13;
minute on a project where the lawyer raised a question. We're financing&#13;
through the GEF [Global Environment Facility], we're financing a project to&#13;
phase out incandescent light bulbs in Argentina and replace them with&#13;
compact fluorescent lamps-CFLs. And there was a concern. There are&#13;
400,000 indigenous people in Argentina, but, you know, some Argentines&#13;
deny it. They say there are no indigenous people in Argentina. But the&#13;
question was, well, how many of them don't speak Spanish, you know? Well,&#13;
no one could answer it.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, my recommendation is find out, and in those cases where you&#13;
have a largely or substantially monolingual community and you want to&#13;
promote the use of these CFLs, find someone who speaks the local language,&#13;
who is bilingual, possibly a member of the group itself, and who can be your&#13;
spokesperson and carry the message to those groups about energy efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So, you know-and that's not so radical, although you should see,&#13;
you know, the people who are involved with the electrical utilities; they say,&#13;
"Oh, you know you can't ask a power company to do that." Well, in fact, you&#13;
can, and then very often the clients are more adaptable than we think they&#13;
are.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, the other is that the power companies must have people who&#13;
can speak the indigenous languages themselves in order to deal with them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                         29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Oh, very often. They have people who are linemen .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. and so on, who are out there working on a daily basis.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And the other is, I guess, just to get a women's perspective on&#13;
things you have to have people who speak the-if, as you say, the women as a&#13;
rule tend to be monolingual.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And that's common in many minorities.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: That where men may be bilingual, but women are not because&#13;
women don't have an exposure to outside society.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what were some of the other projects, or efforts, that were&#13;
made with indigenous people that you worked on?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Well, I designed a project which was later taken over by Judith&#13;
[M.] Lisansky -and managed very, very well, I might say-to physically&#13;
demarcate indigenous lands in Brazil, because the Brazilian constitution&#13;
requires that all indigenous lands that have been identified must be physically&#13;
demarcated and registered as indigenous property; they're demarcated as&#13;
federal property, but exclusively for the use of indigenous people.&#13;
&#13;
And that project I started out back in-with-at the beginning of the Pilot&#13;
Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forest in '91, designing&#13;
the project. And, basically, the project design that we developed at that time&#13;
was put into effect, and an anthropologist named Judith Lisansky took over&#13;
management of the project; did a very good job; in fact, did some things that&#13;
I thought were quite innovative. She brought indigenous people to&#13;
participate in the annual evaluation of the project and also in the review of&#13;
priorities, because the project invested I think it was about $25 million, and&#13;
succeeded in demarcating 44 million hectares of land, an area bigger than&#13;
Germany and Belgium put together, mainly in the Amazon region of Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, was this controversial within Brazil?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Not terribly, at the time. There are areas-what's happening in&#13;
Brazil now-and this is again it's something that I think it takes someone&#13;
who's got a social science perspective to-not only anthropology, but&#13;
political science as well-to see what's happening. What's happening in&#13;
Brazil is that large areas with substantial indigenous populations, almost all&#13;
of them have now been identified and demarcated.&#13;
&#13;
The problem comes when you start getting to the smaller areas where there's&#13;
an indigenous population or a mixed population. There's one such area in the&#13;
State of Roraima, for example, which is called Raposa Serra do Sui, and that&#13;
area is now the object of major controversy because there's a large number of&#13;
non-indigenous people living in it, along with some 10,000 indigenous&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
It was identified, and went through the entire legal process, and was&#13;
demarcated as an indigenous land. It was approved by the president. But&#13;
there are these big, non-indigenous settlements-there's an entire town.&#13;
There's another town that's in effect isolated by-cut off from the rest of the&#13;
world by this reservation. There are some large-scale rice producers in the&#13;
area. There's 10,000 indigenous people, which is a substantial population for&#13;
an indigenous population in Brazil, mainly of the Makushi ethnicity, who&#13;
basically want this reservation all to themselves. They don't accept the&#13;
presence of non-indigenous people. Non-indigenous people who have some&#13;
political clout, particularly these large-scale rice producers, want to remain&#13;
where they are. They want to continue producing rice. So there's a huge&#13;
conflict which has erupted into violence already in the area. But it may get&#13;
worse in connection with this because the policy of the Brazilian government&#13;
is that non-indigenous people can't live on indigenous land. They must be&#13;
removed. The Bank, I think wisely, didn't get involved directly in this, but&#13;
this is a typical kind of situation which they're going to run into more and&#13;
more in Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, the indigenous people tend to be the poorest of the poor, or&#13;
is that too much of a generalization?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Too much of a simplification, simply because it's hard to judge&#13;
poverty as a dimension of indigenous people's existence. Where they're&#13;
living in a fairly non-monetized, non-market situation, they're neither rich&#13;
nor poor. They're simply indigenous people.&#13;
&#13;
Now, as they become more and more involved in a cash economy, and they&#13;
begin raising cattle and, like some Xavante groups-I keep coming back to&#13;
the Xavante, but they're a good example of a lot of things. The Xavante-&#13;
some of the Xavante are producing bananas for sale. And as they become&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         31&#13;
&#13;
more and more involved in the local regional economy, well, then there are&#13;
rich and poor. And there are-you're starting to see things like nutritional&#13;
problems among indigenous people, among the poor indigenous people.&#13;
Sometimes indigenous leaders exploit their own people iri one way or another.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in the issue of deforestation, is that related mainly to&#13;
indigenous people or is that .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No, no. It's a ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That's a much larger.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. broader environmental issue.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: People have come-become-and this has motivated the Bank, even&#13;
though it's a fallacy-people have come to think of the Amazon region as the&#13;
lungs of the world. It's not. It produces as much C02 as it does oxygen, but&#13;
it is also as a repository of this vast wealth of biodiversity. It is that. And a&#13;
great deal of it has not been described. And there may be, as the popular&#13;
belief goes, a cure for cancer out there in one of those thousands of un-&#13;
catalogued plants.&#13;
&#13;
So there's a general mystery and fascination with a vast wilderness or&#13;
untamed land, which is the sort of popular view of the Amazon, you know,&#13;
and people love to think of, you know, going-exploring, you know, remote&#13;
rivers and seeing pythons hanging from trees and monkeys running around&#13;
and toucans and parrots flying all around and so on. And you can see those&#13;
things, you know, although perhaps not as frequently as in a film.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It's not a-you don't quite see them in the density you would&#13;
imagine from the movies, but .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. you know, the National Geographic specials, but they're there.&#13;
And people are fascinated with that. And people have-all over the world,&#13;
particularly in Europe and North America, particularly in Germany, which is&#13;
very concerned with tropical forests .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. which has devastated-you know, there's not a single natural&#13;
forest left in Germany.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Really? I didn't know that.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes, like the Black Forest. You didn't know that?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It's all artificial. It's planted. It's not a natural forest. It was&#13;
clear cut at one point. And people all over the world have this sense that the&#13;
Amazon forest has to be preserved.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It's-A! [Albert J.] Gore [Jr.] once made a very unwise comment&#13;
about how there ought to be some kind of international control over the&#13;
Amazon. And this went down very badly in Brazil. And that comment is&#13;
being used now, 25 years later, still as an excuse for a certain amount of&#13;
chauvinism: exclude the foreigners, keep the foreigners out, hyper-&#13;
nationalism. But people have this deep feeling for the Amazon, and there's a&#13;
lot of deforestation going on. It's going on as the result of the expansion of&#13;
cattle and soybeans; timber companies going in, opening up logging roads.&#13;
Then settlers move down those roads and they settle in the forest. They begin&#13;
clearing little pieces of forest until finally the aggregate result is large&#13;
cleared areas. And that's very often when the cattle people come in.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Ah ...&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, was the Bank involved, in terms of promoting growth and&#13;
so on, and policies that led to deforestation or ... ?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Well, it is. It was and it is. But it's an ambiguous, ambivalent&#13;
pol icy. The Bank has recently-the IFC [International finance Corporation]&#13;
has recently made a loan to the largest soybean producer in Brazil-in the&#13;
world, for that matter. And soybeans have been part of the expansion into&#13;
forested areas in the Amazon. And it also made a loan to-IFC also made a&#13;
loan to the second largest meat packer in Brazil, which is a huge company.&#13;
And these loans are seen as extremely negative, adverse from the perspective&#13;
of preservation of the Amazon rain forest, I think particularly the cattle-the&#13;
meat packer's loan. The Bank has done sector work. Sergio Margulis has the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
latest report to come out about four years ago, in which he showed&#13;
convincingly that the expansion of cattle is the major cause of deforestation&#13;
in the Amazon.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Huh.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Expansion of cattle. Cattle is expanding because there's a huge&#13;
demand for beef in many countries, and because Brazil is gradually extending&#13;
control over these areas where there is hoof and mouth disease, and to&#13;
eradicate the disease. And so there's certain regions of Brazil from which the&#13;
U.S. and Europe can now legally import beef. Until this eradication had&#13;
taken place, that all beef from Brazil and, as a matter of fact, all meat&#13;
products from Brazil were .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Banned.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. embargoed because of the risk of hoof and mouth disease, which&#13;
is extremely contagious.&#13;
&#13;
So the Bank, on the one hand, has made a major contribution, not just in&#13;
Margulis's study, but in other studies, to exposing the risk of expansion of&#13;
cattle, to exposing the risk of road expansion, to exposing the risk of timber&#13;
exploration to the rain forest. And at the same time, we're financing-you&#13;
know, with our right hand, we're doing that-we've also financed a number&#13;
of projects as part of the pilot program, which was a program that was&#13;
initiated back in 1990 by the G-7.&#13;
&#13;
In 1990, when [West German Chancellor] Helmut Kohl saw that he was losing&#13;
support among the Green Party, he proposed the pilot program without any&#13;
preparation at the 1990 Houston Meeting of the G-7 presidents. And the&#13;
Bank became the manager of it. Most of the money that went into it was&#13;
German, but it had a number of projects attached to it. One of them was the&#13;
indigenous lands project that I just mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And other projects were designed mainly to reduce the rate of&#13;
deforestation in the Amazon. That was the intention, although there was a lot&#13;
of waffling over stating that very clearly. And the reason was-there was a&#13;
good reason for that. The reason is that the Bank can't promise-in fact,&#13;
couldn't promise-that-nobody could promise that a program-not with $350&#13;
million and not with $350 billion-to arrest the progress of deforestation.&#13;
With soybeans at $10 a bushel and higher, and with beef prices the way they&#13;
are, with China starting to consume ..&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. large amounts of beef, and Japan and other countries as well,&#13;
there's a huge worldwide demand for beef. You know, those economic forces&#13;
are much greater and more powerful than the Bank and the European Union&#13;
and the, you know, the G-7 countries and they're-you know; this may seem&#13;
silly to say it, but they're investing a piddling $350 million.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You know? It was-and particularly under the circumstances that&#13;
exist in the Amazon. And these are things that, you know, it's really hard for&#13;
someone who thinks at the macro level to understand.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: To look at. Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You know, well, you put in so much money, you get a result. You&#13;
know, how much land do you put into preservation?&#13;

&#13;
BECKER: This is the afternoon session with Daniel Gross at the World&#13;
Bank, April 30th, 2008. And this is Bill Becker again.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And Dan Gross.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. You mentioned to me that there was something that you&#13;
had talked about earlier that you wanted to follow up on, and also that you&#13;
have a minority view about?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yeah. Well, I think the perceived wisdom about the Polnoroeste&#13;
projects is that they were the Bank's donnybrook, that they represent poor&#13;
judgment, and a project that caused a great deal of environmental and social&#13;
damage. I think what's forgotten are a few important facts.&#13;
&#13;
One is that the road that the Bank allegedly built was actually-existed since&#13;
1972. It had been built by the army, and it was part of a more ambitious&#13;
scheme to integrate the entire Amazon into the country, which was one of the&#13;
goals of the military regime. And the road was combined with a very, very&#13;
strong, powerful inducement to migrate into the-this region of Brazil, which&#13;
is basically western and northwestern Mato Grosso and most of the State of&#13;
Rondonia, which at the time, in the 1970s, was still a territory. It was not yet&#13;
a state.&#13;
&#13;
And actually, before the government of Brazil's Polonoroeste project was&#13;
implemented, there was a tremendous amount of advertising and inducement&#13;
to go to-from the southern states of Brazil, which were becoming densely&#13;
populated, particularly the state of Parana, where a transition was underway&#13;
from coffee, a relatively labor-intensive crop, to soybeans and other crops,&#13;
which require less labor. There was a lot of farm consolidation. Many small&#13;
coffee farmers were being bought out by larger, better-capitalized farmers.&#13;
Parana lost about a million people in population during this period. Contrary&#13;
to what happened in most of Brazilian history, they did not migrate to cities,&#13;
but rather many of those migrants moved to Mato Grosso and Rondonia, and&#13;
they remain there to this day. That's why you see so many people with&#13;
German and Italian surnames, whose ancestors had migrated from Europe to&#13;
Brazil and settled in Parana, then they moved to the so-called Northwest.&#13;
More than half of the people who migrated to that region were already there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
when the Bank carne on the scene. That's pretty clear from the data.&#13;
&#13;
So the story is not that the Bank built a penetration road, and that it was&#13;
subsequently settled. The road was in place since 1972, and by 1981 more&#13;
than half the settlers had arrived. What the Bank did was to finance road&#13;
paving and bridge building. There were about 60 rivers which had to be&#13;
crossed; previously, they had been crossed by ferries.&#13;
&#13;
The biggest problem of the region was not an environmental problem. It was&#13;
a social problem. It was a human problem. And that was that settlers were&#13;
growing rice at that point, and they were unable to get their product to market&#13;
because of road conditions.&#13;
&#13;
And there was a lot of malaria in the area, so there was also a health crisis.&#13;
People had no income, and many people were afflicted with malaria in the&#13;
area, which is typical of a newly settled area in the humid tropics.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to that, there was encroachment on indigenous lands, and there&#13;
was a fair amount of deforestation going on as a result of all these hundreds&#13;
of thousands of small-scale settlers moving into the area receiving free land&#13;
grants from the government.&#13;
&#13;
Part of the advertising campaign was "Trade 10 hectares in Parana for a&#13;
hundred in Rondonia." And that was the case for many people. They built&#13;
many, many settlements in Rondonia with minimum infrastructure and&#13;
particularly with poor road infrastructure, so that during the rainy season,&#13;
when they were trying to move crops out of the region, there was a&#13;
monumental problem. There would sometimes be lines of trucks carrying rice&#13;
to markets further south lined up for miles and miles while they waited for&#13;
ferries to cross rivers. And, as I said, there were about 60 crossings.&#13;
&#13;
So the Bank carne in largely as a-at the request of the Brazilian government&#13;
to help resolve a crisis. And the Bank-staff of the Bank went there. There&#13;
were people who were dead-opposed to the project. They thought that there&#13;
would be a risk to the Bank, and there was a reputational risk. But there&#13;
were many people who felt that because of the human situation that was going&#13;
on there and the really serious problems-there was a lot of mortality and&#13;
morbidity associated with malaria and hunger-that the Bank should go in&#13;
and try to make the best of a bad situation. So, you know, the attitude that, I&#13;
think, prevailed at the time was: "Terrible without us; better with us." And I&#13;
don't think anyone ever thought that we could turn the sow's ear into a silk&#13;
purse, but I think people thought that we could ameliorate the situation.&#13;
&#13;
What did happen was that some of the encroachment went on, and some of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
the-and a lot of the deforestation went forward because of this huge crush of&#13;
people. But the Bank established, through its influence and through the&#13;
project, more than 20 different indigenous reserves, which I do not believe&#13;
would have been established without the Bank's intervention.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This was before the law?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No, no. The constitution was adopted in 1988-well, it was before&#13;
the constitutional provision, but there was already a legal basis for&#13;
establishing indigenous reserves .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. in Brazil. And many had already been created elsewhere in&#13;
Brazil. But in this region-Matto Grosso and Rondonia-very few of them&#13;
had been legally established and demarcated, giving them effective&#13;
protection.&#13;
&#13;
Using Bank funds, and sometimes without Bank funds, the federal&#13;
government identified and demarcated more than 20 reserves for a total of&#13;
probably eight or nine million hectares of land. And at this point today, 99.&#13;
percent of the indigenous people who live in Rondonia live on protected&#13;
areas, and areas that are set aside for their exclusive use. Â·That's not to say&#13;
that there's not encroachment on indigenous lands. There is, but nowhere&#13;
near the scale that was occurring prior to the Bank's intervention. The Bank&#13;
also supported the creation of numerous-probably 15 or 16-natural&#13;
protected areas for nature protection in these states of Rondonia, to a lesser&#13;
extent in Mato Grosso.&#13;
&#13;
The Polonoreste program also included a separate malaria prevention and&#13;
control project. It also supported projects that were designed to help provide&#13;
infrastructure, not just roads, but also social infrastructure, such as schools,&#13;
community centers, health posts and so on, in the region to serve the people&#13;
who had migrated into the region.&#13;
&#13;
So the Bank was really chasing after what was clearly going to be a bad&#13;
situation. And it caught a lot of flack and a lot of criticism, much of which&#13;
was very unfair because of the-what was frequently stated or implied, which&#13;
was the Bank had opened up a .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: An area.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. an area to migration, which was absolutely not true, and that the&#13;
Bank had contributed to deforestation, which was partly true, in the sense&#13;

&amp;#12;                                         38&#13;
&#13;
that paved roads made it easier for people and goods to move in and out of&#13;
the area. That may have contributed to some of the deforestation that went&#13;
on. But it also established the protected areas, both nature protection areas&#13;
and protected areas for indigenous people, that I do not believe would have&#13;
been established without the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So, that's basically what I want to say.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And this became a huge issue. There were hearings in the U.S.&#13;
Congress, for example, in which Polonoreste was cited as an example of the&#13;
Bank's wanton destruction of this precious Amazonian environment. And&#13;
there was a lot of rhetoric, a lot of saliva, a lot of ink spilled over this.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. When were these hearings? Late '80s?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: No, the mid-1980s.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mid-' 80s?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yeah. Early to mid-'80s. There was-I can't remember the name&#13;
of the congressman who, with the assistance of some U.S. NGOs, held&#13;
hearings on the topic, brought some Brazilians up who were opponents of the&#13;
Polonoroeste scheme. But most of what was said and done was way too late,&#13;
because the army had built this road back in the '70s. The migration had&#13;
already begun, and it was a massive migration.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It was not a few thousand people. It was hundreds of thousands of&#13;
people who were moving into Rondonia with the hope of a better life.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Now, who, by the way-to back up a little bit-who had pushed the switch&#13;
from coffee to soybeans, and was that simply the market, or was that the&#13;
government or ... ?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Two things. I happen to know a little bit about this topic because&#13;
one of the studies I did as a consultant prior to joining the Bank was the&#13;
study of agricultural higher education in Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-f1nal Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Brazil developed a very effective plant breeding program during the '70s,&#13;
and-actually starting in the '60s, in about 1965. From 1965 'til 1980, there&#13;
was a USAID program which established four post-graduate courses in&#13;
agriculture in four different universities in Brazil, one of which became the&#13;
leader in the development of short photoperiod soybeans. Soybeans had&#13;
previously been planted mainly in Southern Brazil, which has a temperate&#13;
climate. But what they developed was a soy variety which could thrive in a&#13;
more tropical, low latitude climate, and so soy began creeping northward. It&#13;
went into Parana. World prices of soy were rising. China was importing soy.&#13;
The U.S. was unable to supply all the markets. And now, of course, there are&#13;
many U.S. soy producers who regard this USAID program as treason, because&#13;
it did help create this enormously successful soybean industry in Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Competitors.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Competitors.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Absolutely. So it's an interesting case, and this is that it was a&#13;
development aid that helped to sponsor this-the development of this very&#13;
effective plant breeding program in Brazil, particularly at the Federal&#13;
University of Vi9osa and also the State University in Sao Paulo at Piracicaba,&#13;
where the plant breeders were working. And these guys were excellent plant&#13;
breeders, and they helped develop the breeds that allowed soy to be creeping&#13;
northward.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And now, it's within four or five degrees of the equator. It's even&#13;
above the equator. They're planting soy in Roraima. So there's an&#13;
interesting international angle to that whole story.&#13;
&#13;
You know-but market forces were the main factor that led to the expansion&#13;
of soy. The coffee was exhausting the soil. There was a lot of competition.&#13;
The Brazilian government established a policy, back in the '70s, to&#13;
decentralize coffee because Parana was subject to occasional frosts which&#13;
caused large crop losses. So they began encouraging farmers, and providing&#13;
incentives for farmers further north, out of the frost zones, in the states of&#13;
Minas and Bahia particularly, to grow coffee. So coffee was de-emphasized&#13;
in Parana. Soybeans was emphasized. And there was also-there were also&#13;
major government programs to subsidize fertilizers and tractors. Fertilizer&#13;
purchases were subsidized by federal assistance. And those were necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         40&#13;
&#13;
ingredients for successful soy cultivation in Parana.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now what did they think or what did the Brazilian government&#13;
think would happen to the people who were basically accustomed to the labor&#13;
intensive kind of coffee cultivation? Did they really think through the&#13;
consequences of the kinds of population shift that would come?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: NoÂ·. They did not. They didn't provide adequate infrastructure for&#13;
such a large population. They provided the incentive, which was land that&#13;
was essentially free. It was, you know, distributed to the, you know, first&#13;
comer, and a minimum amount of infrastructure for people to get there-dirt&#13;
roads-and a lot of advertising. There was a lot of advertising for ~~Move out&#13;
of Parana. Move to Rondonia. You can trade 10 hectares for a hundred, and&#13;
of good land. And the land is good. It's fertile land. It's .. "&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So what do people grow up there?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Coffee, rice, cocoa-cacao-and subsistence crops.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Coffee.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: They've started growing cacao, but there was a disease that&#13;
intervened, and now it's soybeans, pasture, cotton, and subsistence crops.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the indigenous people in this area, were they-you made a distinction&#13;
earlier-involved in the market, and others were more or less, I guess, living&#13;
a life of subsistence farming?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Correct. Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When you say these lands are set aside by the government, do the&#13;
indigenous people in those lands grow coffee? Do they grow cotton?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: In some cases, there were lands that had been occupied by&#13;
encroachers where coffee had been planted and in some cases, like on the&#13;
Sete de Setembro Reserve, indigenous people actually began harvesting the&#13;
coffee that had been planted previously, after the encroachers were removed.&#13;
There is no indigenous tradition of intensive agriculture using tree crops, for&#13;
example. They practice a more itinerant form of agriculture known as slash&#13;
and burn. And-but in some cases, indigenous people did begin, if not&#13;
cultivating, at least harvesting coffee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
More often, they became involved in other activities, sometimes manioc&#13;
production for market, and unfortunately a number of groups were lured into&#13;
the drug trade. There are airstrips on most indigenous lands, and some of&#13;
these airstrips were used by smugglers for drug shipments from Bolivia,&#13;
which is just a few hundred kilometers away to the west .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. into Brazil, Bolivia being a major source of cocaine. And to this&#13;
day, there's a lot of cocaine that is imported into Brazil through this route,&#13;
through-they've also become involved in diamond and gold mining.&#13;
Interestingly enough that in some cases, it's very rarely that indigenous&#13;
people themselves exploit diamonds and gold. But they have benefited from&#13;
diamond and gold miners that they permit to enter their reserved areas to&#13;
mine. And these are very environmentally destructive.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: We had one situation where-when we resumed lending toMato&#13;
Grosso in 1989, we had prepared a project in the state of Mato Grosso, which&#13;
became known as PRODEAGRO, which had two different names: in&#13;
Portuguese, it was called the Program for the Development of Agriculture,&#13;
and in English, it was called the Mato Grosso Natural Resource Management&#13;
Project. So you can see the way there were different spins: one that satisfied&#13;
what Brazilians were interested in, and one which satisfied what the Bank&#13;
was interested in.&#13;
&#13;
But there was a situation that emerged just as the new project was about to&#13;
become effective. There had been an invasion of some 6,000 wildcat gold&#13;
miners onto the Sarare Indigenous Reserve in Mato Grosso, and it became-it&#13;
was widely reported in the press. It was a massive invasion of these gold&#13;
miners who were camping there and really degrading the environment in a&#13;
serious way. They brought high pressure pumps, and they were using&#13;
mercury to extract the gold from the ore. And it was just a mess. And the&#13;
Bank made it a-this was in about 1991 or so-the Bank made removing the&#13;
miners a condition of disbursement that the authorities remove these gold&#13;
miners from this indigenous land. And I was told to go and verify that the&#13;
miners had been removed.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, I see.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So there I had one of my more interesting World Bank experiences,&#13;
where I wen.t into the mining area escorted by six federal policemen armed to&#13;
the teeth with Uzis. And it was hard to tell them apart from desperadoes,&#13;

&amp;#12;                                          42&#13;
&#13;
except for the vests that they had on .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. that said federal police. But 1-we walked into one of the&#13;
mining camps that had been moved just outside the reserve. And need less to&#13;
say, we were not a welcome presence there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: But we went in to verify that the miners were, in fact, outside the&#13;
reservation.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
What other kinds of projects you were involved in. I mean, I'm aware of this&#13;
project on sustainable world development [Para Integrated Rural Development&#13;
Project in Support of the First Phase of the Para Rural Program]. Were you&#13;
involved in that? I know you were involved in the report.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Para. Oh, that was the last project I prepared as task manager for&#13;
the Bank. The project was approved by the Board, I think, in December of&#13;
2006, if I'm not mistaken. I may have that date wrong.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: But, yeah, I had begun the preparation of that project in 2003&#13;
really, you know, more than a year before I retired.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Now, were you still working on these other.         . ?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Some of them, yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Some of them.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I was still the task manager of the National Environmental Project.&#13;
I was still involved-! was getting involved-! had been involved actually for&#13;
two or three years in a community forestry project in Mexico, which 1-was a&#13;
great opportunity for me to work outside of Brazil for a change. And I had&#13;
also been involved in a-1 was task manager for two or three years of an&#13;
irrigation project, which the Bank financed, which was another kind of-it's&#13;
another project that's widely thought of as having been a big failure, but it&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
was not ...&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was this in Brazil or .         ?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes, it was called the ltaparica.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now this was in the '90s, still?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes, in the '90s.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Could you tell me a little bit that, the irrigation project?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: The Itaparica project was a project that was developed by-Maritta&#13;
Koch-Weser was actually the person who designed it, and then it was handed&#13;
over to me-which was an irrigation project to provide a means of survival, a&#13;
basis for subsistence for people who had been relocated from the basin that&#13;
was flooded of the Sao Francisco River to make way for a dam, a hydropower&#13;
dam, which the Bank did not finance, that is called the Luis Gonzaga dam,&#13;
but it's known popularly in Brazil and in the Bank as Itaparica.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank had made a large sector loan to the power sector in Brazil, which&#13;
led to Bank supervision of major power projects in Brazil. The Bank did not&#13;
finance the dam itself. Maritta Koch- Weser found out that the Itaparica&#13;
project was underway, that there was no real resettlement plan. At Maritta's&#13;
instigation, the Bank offered to finance the resettlement. Planning is the&#13;
bedrock basis of the Bank's safeguard policy, which is to plan ahead, which&#13;
is to know how many people that are involved and so on. And so the Bank&#13;
financed a project that started out at a value of about $130 million to provide&#13;
irrigation infrastructure. And for some-I'm trying to remember-it was&#13;
something like 10,000 families.&#13;
&#13;
The deal that was struck between the Brazilian government and a group of&#13;
unions representing the resettled families came at a moment of relative&#13;
weakness for the Brazilian government. It was at the moment where the&#13;
government was moving from a military government to an elected president,&#13;
selected by the military to run. It was a period of democratization.&#13;
&#13;
And the combination of the Bank's involvement and pressure from these&#13;
unions led the power company to accept a deal, which was very generous for&#13;
the resettled families. It basically said that any family that had an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
agricultural "tradition" was entitled to at least one-and-a-half hectares up to&#13;
as many as six hectares of irrigated land as compensation for resettlement, in&#13;
addition to housing in so-called "agro villas," or villages of from 40 to 80&#13;
houses, each with full infrastructure: health posts, school, water supply, and&#13;
so on.&#13;
&#13;
This was in 1986. The dam was already under construction. The Bank came&#13;
in and financed this resettlement project. We did not finance the housing,&#13;
which was already practically done, but we did finance the irrigation&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
But there were major problems with it. There were at least three kinds of&#13;
problems, and it wa      n this case, the Bank was partly at fault. First of all,&#13;
we used outdated information on the areas where there were suitable soils for&#13;
irrigation, so there was a technical problem that some of these areas were, if&#13;
they ever had been, or if it had adequate soils for irrigation, they didn't at the&#13;
time that the project began. And it took years to realize that.&#13;
&#13;
The second problem was that the project was underfunded. The Bank had&#13;
low-balled theÂ· cost estimate. We had-and for this I claim no credit, because&#13;
this was done by irrigation engineers who should have known better that the&#13;
project was going to cost a lot more than the estimate. There was one place&#13;
where the-where the water had to be raised a total of 160 meters, which is-&#13;
I don't know if you know much about irrigation, but it's fabulously expensive&#13;
to raise water even one meter, you know, large volumes of water, and-but&#13;
160 meters, and then put it into canals and transport the water through canals&#13;
and pipe.lines to the irrigation perimeter was incredibly ambitious, and we&#13;
had not done the cost estimates properly.&#13;
&#13;
And finally, we really didn't know enough about resettlement in those days to&#13;
recommend to our borrower that they have adequate controls over who was&#13;
going to be entitled to this benefit. The concept of a family having an&#13;
agricultural tradition could mean that a family that-where someone has spent&#13;
a summer picking tomatoes would be entitled to one-and-a-half hectares of&#13;
land. Having access to six hectares of irrigated land is almost an absurdity&#13;
because there's no family that's large enough to work that much irrigated&#13;
land.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It's a-it sounds like-it doesn't sound like much. It's about 16&#13;
acres, so it sounds like a small amount of land. But irrigated crops, you&#13;
know, are usually fruits and vegetables or fruit trees or some crop that's quite&#13;
labor intensive. And these people did not have-none of them had family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Daniel Gross&#13;
                              April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
labor adequate to work that much land.&#13;
&#13;
So the entitlements under this resettlement plan were too ambitious and too&#13;
generous. In addition to that, the power company that was managing the&#13;
process kind of looked the other way when a number of people came in who&#13;
are basically rent seekers, you know, just some people were-people that had&#13;
migrated to Sao Paulo 10 years earlier. They heard about this land giveaway.&#13;
They came back and claimed that they were ...&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Given their agricultural backgrounds?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right, that they were farmers and that they-you know, they'd&#13;
always lived in the area and so on. And I even photographed people who&#13;
have been making bricks and roof tiles to build new houses in the flood area.&#13;
There was some construction built deliberately knowing that it would be&#13;
flooded the following year. And so there was a lot of this of what I call&#13;
speculative squatting. So there was a lack of control over the number of&#13;
people, a lack of control over the kind of entitlements that were provided,&#13;
and the result was that there were-in addition to the technical problems I've&#13;
alluded to-there were huge cost overruns.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what were the positives of this?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: The positives were that really for the first time in that region of&#13;
Brazil, there was adequate attention being given to people who are&#13;
involuntarily resettled. There had been a tradition of a project-there were-&#13;
there are now a total of five hydro-powered dams on the San Francisco. The&#13;
most recent dam that had been built there is one called Sobradinho, which is&#13;
much larger and which had flooded several cities in addition to many, many&#13;
rural properties, and in which the resettlement planning and execution was&#13;
very poor. And there was a diaspora of tens of thousands of people.&#13;
&#13;
In the Sobradinho project, the urban populations were fairly well attended&#13;
to, as they tend to be in Brazil. The rural populations were basically given a&#13;
small payment, a cash payment, and sent on their way. And there was&#13;
virtually no resettlement of rural populations, so many of these people ended&#13;
up living in urban slums somewhere.&#13;
&#13;
So there was a-with that as a background, the Bank came in and established&#13;
really a much higher standard for resettlement in the wer sector in Brazil.&#13;
This was lar     the doin of Maritta Koch-Weser.&#13;

~~ :z    0&#13;
&#13;
               )( So-and during that time, there was a lot of conflict. The power company put&#13;
               wall the people who were living in these villages, but had no means of&#13;
                  subsistence, on a dole, on a maintenance payment, which was actually pretty&#13;
                  generous at the time. It was more than a minimum salary, which in that&#13;
                  region is enough for a family to live on. And there was no-nothing to stop&#13;
                  people from doing dry land farming and herding-grazing animals and other&#13;
                  activities. So they could still work.&#13;
&#13;
                    BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
                    GROSS: But many of them didn't. And they spent 10 years just living on&#13;
                    this dole. And, I mean, if you go into any community that subsists on&#13;
                    welfare, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say this created a sense&#13;
                    of dependency, of depression, and a lot of alcoholism, a lot of internal&#13;
                    community conflict as a result of this long period in which people lived on&#13;
                    this maintenance payment.&#13;
&#13;
                    BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
                    GROSS: So that was something I think the Bank-no, we can say, you know,&#13;
                    we goofed. We made a big mistake.&#13;
&#13;
                    BECKER: Okay. So the Bank got a black eye from this?&#13;
&#13;
                    GROSS: Yes, it did. Not as much as Polonoroeste, though. One of the&#13;
                    things that you find out is that in the Bank, you know, some people say as a&#13;
                    joke, but it's almost not a joke, and-that no good deed goes unpunished.&#13;
                    You know, I think we made fewer mistakes in Polonoroeste than we did in&#13;
                    Itaparica, but I would-the biggest black eye we got is from Polonoroeste.&#13;
&#13;
                    BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
                    GROSS: Even in the Polonoroeste project, the local NGOs, which made it&#13;
                    into such a cause celebre, were the NGOs that were created, whole cloth, by&#13;
                    the foreign NGOs, by World Wildlife, by Oxfam and so on. They were just-&#13;
                    they were literally recruited and established and equipped and financed from&#13;
                    outside.&#13;
&#13;
                    The biggest problems that emerged in that project were not in Rondonia.&#13;
                    They were in Mato Grosso. But the organizing, where we had-where the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        Daniel Gross&#13;
                                                 April 30, 2008-Fina/ Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       47&#13;
&#13;
NGOs had their surrogates, as it were, was in Rondonia. So all the problems&#13;
that were brought to-into focus were in Rondonia. And Mato Grosso was&#13;
relatively neglected.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And so, you know, there again, you know, the focus was really not&#13;
on where the greater problems were. So, you know, Rondonia was where the&#13;
NGOs could manipulate the situation.&#13;
&#13;
And manipulate they did. Let me tell you the NGOs-it' 11 give you a very,&#13;
very different view of the NGOs than the one that they projected themselves,&#13;
when you see the kind of manipulation that they engaged in. Just as one&#13;
really dramatic example: I went to a meeting in Rondonia of a mid-term&#13;
review of the Rondonia Project, which is one of the successor projects to&#13;
Polonoroeste. The Rondonia Project was called PLANFLORO. This was a-&#13;
this was a big deal. The review was publicized, and NGOs came as&#13;
observers; you know, they had their own local surrogates there in Rondonia.&#13;
One of the representatives of Oxfam gave an interview to the Guardian in&#13;
which she declared that the purpose of this meeting was for the Bank to pull&#13;
out of the project and walk away from it after having created this huge mess.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: She made that declaration before the meeting even began, and I&#13;
don't know whether she, you know, thought that the Guardian wouldn't run&#13;
the story so early, but, you know, I pick it up on the newsstand and-in an&#13;
airport-and when I got there, I was reading it, and this woman shows up at&#13;
the meeting. And I said, "What is this nonsense? You're already announcing&#13;
the outcome of the-and the purpose of the meeting and the Bank's&#13;
intentions." And, you know, needless to say, she was embarrassed, and we&#13;
used to talk, and then she never called me again. But it was an example of&#13;
how some of these NGOs are really unscrupulous.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. What is their goal? Why would they be unscrupulous?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Because the Bank is a very convenient enemy. The Bank is the&#13;
biggest kid on the block when it comes to the multilateral development banks.&#13;
If you want to attack anybody, go after the World Bank. Forget the Asian&#13;
Bank, the IDB, the African Development Bank. You know, these are small&#13;
fry. And if you want to make a big spectacle, and you want to get a lot of&#13;
attention, you go after the World Bank. And then you want to show how the&#13;
World Bank is a very poor steward of the environment; that it's exploiting&#13;
indigenous people and poor peasants and so on; that-and this is not saying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
that none of that happens. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that there&#13;
haven't been some terrible things that have happened in Bank projects. And&#13;
sometimes it was because of the Bank's neglect, and the Bank's failure. But&#13;
the NGOs, to further their own environmental and social goals, have many-&#13;
in many cases exaggerated and distorted the picture, very often as part of&#13;
their fundraising activity.&#13;
&#13;
You know, one really flagrant example was someone from Environmental&#13;
Defense sent out a letter when Chico Mendes-the labor leader, who became&#13;
the sort of environmental h~ro of the 1990s-when he was assassinated,&#13;
someone from EDF sent out a ~etter saying that he would personally convey&#13;
the condolences of anyone who contributed a certain amount of money to EDF&#13;
to the widow of Chico Mendes, you know. And I thought that was pretty poor&#13;
taste, fund raising on a man's death.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And it became even more so when the widow of Chico Mendes&#13;
denounced ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. the gentleman who did that and said that he was a-what-she&#13;
described him as a picareta, which is kind of a petty con man in Portuguese.&#13;
&#13;
And so that-you know, the Bank was involved in this kind of war with&#13;
NGOs, which was, in many ways, it was a kind of shadow war, you know. We&#13;
weren't really fighting each other. We had some of the same goals, but they&#13;
found it convenient always to attack the Bank. And the Bank, I have to say,&#13;
is and has been inept in presenting its case to the .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. outside world.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It is amazing how again and again and again the Bank does not&#13;
know how to present itself.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now ..&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And getting all this bad press.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. to jump ahead a little bit here.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yeah. Maybe I'm going on too far about this thing?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: No, no. I want to come back, because there are a couple of other&#13;
questions, but you're talking about just precisely this.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things you said about Wolfensohn is that he did at least begin to&#13;
address the way the Bank was being ..&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Viewed.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. portrayed.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Do you think that's true?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes. Yeah, I think it's true.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And ...&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: He-they formed a group that-well, he put Mark Malloch Brown at&#13;
the head of the ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. the EXT [External Affairs], who then went on to become head of&#13;
UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] and I forgot, what, he's-I&#13;
think he's a minister of state now in the UK .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Is he? I don't ...&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. [inaudible]. Yes, I think so. He became a minister. And he&#13;
strengthened EXT, and he brought in a number of people. I don't think&#13;
they've done a good job. I mean, I can give you chapter and verse about that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: But I think they've-again and again and again, they've-they&#13;
don't know how to present themselves. You know, I've heard like debates&#13;
between critics of the Bank and someone from the Bank trying to defend the&#13;
Bank, and they put up some inarticulate macro economist who can't speak&#13;
clear English, you know, can't-certainly can't speak in a language that you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Fina/ Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and I can understand easily and who stutters and stammers through a defense&#13;
of the Bank that has nothing to do with the criticism that's being made. And&#13;
it's just amazing. I found it just to be astounding how poorly we've done.&#13;
&#13;
(Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. We're back on after our short break. Do you have some&#13;
further reflections about NGOs and working with NGOs and the Bank's&#13;
relationships with the NGOs?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I had a colleague say to me once about a complaint that the Bank&#13;
had received from an NGO about these projects in the Northwest Amazon; the&#13;
colleague said, "What the hell do they have to do with this? You know, this&#13;
is not their business. It's not their country. And where-what legitimacy do&#13;
they have to be criticizing us?"&#13;
&#13;
At that point, the NGOs were saying, and not entirely without foundation,&#13;
that the Bank was not effectively subject to controls from outside the Bank,&#13;
that-and it was a self-contained organization. It had its Board of Directors,&#13;
of course, and theoretically it was under the control of its directors, but in&#13;
fact we all know that there are-that the linkage between decisions being&#13;
taken by the Bank, you know, and the opinions of the member countries is not&#13;
a close one, and that, in fact, the president and the staff of the Bank have a&#13;
great deal of latitude. And to a large extent, at that point, there was&#13;
relatively little accountability.&#13;
&#13;
But I can remember some of my colleagues feeling that there was no&#13;
legitimacy to this kind of criticism, and so I think that what Wolfensohn&#13;
recognized was that (something that a number of people in the Bank had&#13;
already recognized) is that these guys, whether they're well-intentioned or&#13;
not, have a capacity to impose costs on us. They could, for example, make it&#13;
very difficult or impossible to get the IDA [International Development&#13;
Association] subscription renewed. They could oppose the Bank in certain&#13;
kinds of projects in certain countries. They could give the Bank a bad name.&#13;
They-a lot of these NGOs, they have all the fax numbers of all the Executive&#13;
Directors and all the ministers of finance of the Part I countries, and they can&#13;
release a barrage. They have quite a bit of fire power and one heck of a lot&#13;
more, I think more, communication capacity than the Bank has. So I think&#13;
Wolfensohn recognized that, and he realized we'd better start talking to these&#13;
guys, and he reached out to them. And that's all good.&#13;
&#13;
You know, he was a bit naive about it. I think he thought, you know, like if&#13;
we just talk and talk and talk, that everything will be fine. I don't think he&#13;
recognized that you take a group like International Rivers Network; they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
basically don't want any hydro development at all-zero, you know? And so&#13;
the Bank, which finances a great deal of it in the world, is automatically ipso&#13;
facto a bad guy, you know? And so they oppose, you know, any kind of&#13;
hydro power project that you can think of or even an irrigation project.&#13;
They're against it.&#13;
&#13;
You know, it's not just Three Gorges. It's everything. You know, I haven't&#13;
seen yet where a hydro project that they thought was a good one. And you&#13;
got to recognize that. That's where they're coming from. That's what they're&#13;
going to do. You can talk to them, but they're not going to like what you do.&#13;
&#13;
You know, you could try to explain it. You can try to say, "Well, we've&#13;
weighed the negative and the positive. We're going to try to mitigate some&#13;
of the adverse impacts and, but, you know, this is, let's say, electrical power&#13;
for hundreds of thousands of people. And so we feel that that benefit&#13;
outweighs the impact that this project will have on 2,000 people," let's say.&#13;
But if you talk about the benefits to the IRN [International Rivers Network]&#13;
about that, they'll-you know, to Mr. [Glenn] Switkes of IRN .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. he'll tell you, "No way."&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You know? And he'll bring up all the horror statistics that he can&#13;
think of, you know, some of which may be true and some may not be true.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: I'd say some of the other groups are much more mature now.&#13;
Environmental Defense has really matured quite a bit. They're no longer a&#13;
Bank hater. They're no longer the Bruce Rich kind of, you know, just knee&#13;
jerk Bank haters. They're much more measured, I think, in what they say and&#13;
what they think now. World Wildlife probably is too. Even Green Peace is&#13;
now, you know, they're still, you know, out there boarding whaling ships and&#13;
so on and trying, you know, to capture headlines, but they're not rappelling&#13;
down the building across the street anymore the way they did once .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. you know, with unfurling huge banners about the World Bank&#13;
destroying rain forests. So, you know, I think, you know, it-maybe it had to&#13;
happen that way, that the Bank reached out.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We got a lot of people in the Bank who are supposed to be civil society&#13;
specialists. Some of them-I've heard this in a number of countries and I&#13;
have personal experience with this-identify a little too closely with the&#13;
NGOs, and as a consequence they became less than objective in the Bank.&#13;
And they were-some of them were playing both sides. They were playing&#13;
little games. And so they were not well managed.&#13;
&#13;
In some cases, managers-senior managers-felt that these NGO specialists&#13;
were not producing anything of value to the Bank. They wanted them to sell&#13;
the Bank to the world, and to, in some ways, quell or-what's the word I&#13;
want?-not necessarily to annul, but to certainly reduce the impact of a lot of&#13;
this negative publicity the Bank got. To some extent, I think they missed the&#13;
boat; more emphasis should have been placed on outreach to universities in&#13;
the developed and developing world. Many of them are hotbeds of criticism&#13;
of the Bank and of the development paradigm often followed by the Bank.&#13;
Many faculty members take this line and attack the Bank, the Fund, the World&#13;
Trade Organization, and other institutions no matter what they do. So the&#13;
attack presses on indiscriminately against large dams and antiretroviral-&#13;
HIV-treatment, schooling for girls, and highways.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 3, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 4, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: It is helpful to draw a distinction between CDD Projects-&#13;
Community Driven Development Projects and integrated rural development.&#13;
&#13;
Integrated rural development was largely a failure in the northeast of Brazil&#13;
because almost all the resources were swallowed up by the bureaucracy. The&#13;
plant breeders, the agriculture research people, the extensionists all got&#13;
tremendous value of this-out of these projects. And there were nine of&#13;
them. And actually altogether, if you count up all the ones including the&#13;
repeater projects, there probably have been 30 or 40. And the early&#13;
integrated rural development projects were much too technocratically&#13;
oriented and rarely were the benefits actually coordinated; you know, that is&#13;
to say, focused or concentrated on a given community or a given area or sub-&#13;
region. So one community got selected seeds, while another got crop storage.&#13;
&#13;
And there were few successes. And they disbursed poorly. They didn't&#13;
disburse well, and that's always a bad thing in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now how is this project in-is it Para?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Para.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;
                            April 30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Para.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How does that .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: How is it different?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. differ from these other projects?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Okay. It combined the-what I think are the best things from both&#13;
the COD approach and the integrated rural development approach. First of&#13;
all, it was not necessarily community-based but based on a group of&#13;
producers who have a product or more than one product that they produce and&#13;
that is marketable. So it is driven by the interests and demands of producers&#13;
who are linked to markets. In that sense, it's like COD projects, but it's not&#13;
using the small rural community as the base. It's using any group, any&#13;
agglomeration of people who form an association as the basis. So they could&#13;
be, let's say, people in a single river valley who are producing, let's say,&#13;
manioc, or hearts of palm, which is actually a product that's been developed&#13;
in Para.&#13;
&#13;
From the integrated rural development side, it adopted the idea that you can't&#13;
just make a small grant to a community, walk away from it, and say, "Okay,&#13;
now they're developed because that was done." There is-the evidence from&#13;
the northeast of Brazil is that these little COD grants, which are-have a&#13;
limit, usually a ceiling of $20,000, which is enough to buy, you know, half a&#13;
tractor or an old truck or something, you know, or put in a little well for the&#13;
community to have drinking water, they don't contribute to sustainable&#13;
economic growth for the community. They don't raise incomes. There's not&#13;
enough technical assistance associated with them. Sometimes they actually&#13;
do damage. And there's not enough-or there-also they're one-shot.&#13;
They're one off projects that are done for a year and then .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Go away.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. and then ciao.&#13;
&#13;
And so the idea of-behind the Para project is that you need a multi-year&#13;
involvement. You need technical input. If people want to produce&#13;
something, then it has to be produced up to a standard or a level that markets&#13;
demand. And you have to have good financial management. You have to do&#13;
proper economic and financial analysis, you know, feasibility analysis of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
product and the process that you want to use to produce it.&#13;
&#13;
So these are not giveaway projects. These are not welfare projects. They're&#13;
not-not supposed to be politically motivated projects. So-and so the idea&#13;
was that maybe 100 or 130 of these projects would be developed in the state&#13;
of Para, which is nothing like the scale of the COD projects which are done&#13;
in the northeast, where they finance several hundred a year, and on a very&#13;
small scale. Little tiny grants here and there to give them.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So this was for how much?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: $60 million.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: $60 million.&#13;
&#13;
 GROSS: The loan is-it's 60/40, the Bank as contributing $60 million and&#13;
the state government of Para $40 million.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this leads me to a question I wanted to ask before-you alluded to early&#13;
on-and that's the question of the capacity of recipients to, you know, to&#13;
actually make good use of the funds that they receive. Over your time,&#13;
obviously, there's been a change in attitude and a greater understanding of&#13;
that. I mean, where did you see that happening in Brazil in the projects you&#13;
worked on?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: In the projects I worked on, things worked where there was a&#13;
combination of demand from a community and adequate technical inputs and&#13;
over time. Not one-off kinds of inputs.&#13;
&#13;
You know, that-one of the great phrases that's being used for the community&#13;
driven development projects is "the people know." They know what's best&#13;
for them. They know what they want. They know what they need. Well, it&#13;
happens that they don't know how to operate an irrigation system. They&#13;
don't know how to maintain a pump. They don't know about irrigating at&#13;
night to save on electricity charges. These are not things they're born&#13;
knowing or that they have-they know from their agricultural tradition&#13;
because they've always farmed as rain fed farmers and they've used the kind&#13;
of slash and burn agriculture-even-not just in the Amazon, but all through&#13;
the northeast.&#13;
&#13;
So yes, the people know. They know-there's a lot they know. There's a lot&#13;
they don't know. And they need people to work with them who are qualified&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
technical people and who are willing to go out and get their boots dirty--&#13;
which is not common; it's becoming more common, but it's not common over&#13;
large areas of Latin America and, from what I understand, Asia as well&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. that people with, you know, who have university degrees or even&#13;
technical courses are not particularly willing to go out into the countryside.&#13;
And so, it's a special-it's a kind of cadre of people who have a commitment,&#13;
who have the right level of income, salary, and who-and have the training to&#13;
go out and work with groups of poor farmers to impart what they know and to&#13;
help them get on their own feet and establish a viable economy. It's hard as&#13;
hell to do.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: The Bank's been trying to do this for years, you know, through&#13;
various formulas, various approaches, you know: integrated rural&#13;
development and CDD, micro-finance, irrigation, rangeland management,&#13;
watershed management and lot of other, you know, fine, well-intentioned&#13;
approaches.&#13;
&#13;
But it's hard for a host of technical reasons. You know, it's hard because of&#13;
the market conditions. And it's hard for a lot of social reasons. It's hard in&#13;
India because of the caste system. It's hard in Brazil because of the class&#13;
system. It's hard in Peru and Bolivia because of the fact that so many of the&#13;
poor are non-Spanish-speaking indigenous people. They are Quechua&#13;
speakers or Aymara speakers.&#13;
&#13;
So there are barriers and problems everywhere. There's all kinds of problems&#13;
with elite capture, that projects that are intended to provide benefits for poor&#13;
people are actually captured and turned to the benefit of elites, not&#13;
necessarily the top elites of the country, but the local elites managed to get&#13;
like the milk subsidies in India, managed to get the lion's share of these milk&#13;
subsidies or rice subsidies, you know, the rationed rice, where they don't&#13;
have any need for it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So there's all of these problems, and it's not-you know, we can't&#13;
force countries to adopt, let's say, our own view, what might be our view of&#13;
social equity, of how things ought to proceed. We can't force people to&#13;
recognize that poor people sometimes have good ideas themselves, and&#13;
because I've seen again and again and again that people have--and people&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
who are, in some cases, just a notch, a small notch, above the very poorest&#13;
people feel that they-that poor people, you know, because they're illiterate,&#13;
for example, know nothing. There's no way they could know anything that's&#13;
of any value because they can't read. So there's this-there are these&#13;
enormous social barriers that create difficulties in development. And there is&#13;
where social science can benefit.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So this is an issue of the whole capacity of the society to deal&#13;
with the kinds of.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. expertise, and also money that's coming from the .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: .. outside.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So there has to be the right combination, and, you know, god&#13;
knows, I don't have the sort of.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. of technical expertise, of things that people learn in universities,&#13;
of things that people learn in technical schools and the common, on-the-&#13;
ground know-how of how things can be done.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So it's fair to say that a lot of the things you're talking about is&#13;
that there-oh, it's not that there aren't general rules that can be applied to&#13;
notions of development or so on, but that there are a lot of speci fie&#13;
circumstances in a particular place that have to be paid attention to. So .&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Yes. Although I don't go as far as Wolfensohn went when he&#13;
discovered, you know, international development and came out with this&#13;
Comprehensive Development Framework .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. where everything was important.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You know, I certainly don't-in fact, I think one of the problems&#13;
that we've had with some projects is that they attempted to do too much, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
they've opened too many doors and boxes. And we have many, many projects&#13;
still in the Bank which the operational staff know, refer to as Christmas trees&#13;
because they have all of these ornaments .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. you know, and because people have succumbed or, you know,&#13;
agreed to put in a little component about X or Y or Z that ends up distorting&#13;
the whole project and making it unmanageable.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: So a general lesson can be drawn is that it's foolish to think that&#13;
something that works in India is going to automatically work in Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Local knowledge is fundamental. And that includes knowledge of&#13;
the people and the social structure, of gender relations, and of the language.&#13;
&#13;
And the Bank still downgrades the importance of speaking the local language.&#13;
We-very often, you know, you see people being appointed to management&#13;
positions in a region where they don't speak a word of any language that's&#13;
used in that region. Now clearly, in some cases like Eastern Europe, you&#13;
know, you can't learn Bulgarian and Polish and Hungarian and Albanian .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. you know, but it sure as hell helps to know one of those&#13;
languages, or maybe one that many people know, such as Russian.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And it wouldn't hurt to say to managers, "Go out and study&#13;
Russian," because that's the most commonly used language in that region,&#13;
you know, and don't rely so heavily on translators and interpreters.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
I want to turn-we've just got a few minutes left here-to a couple of big&#13;
questions that you have been focusing on, these nicely focused questions&#13;
about a specific area.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: There's been a lot of talk since Wolfensohn and [Paul D.]&#13;
Wolfowitz, and I don't know where President [Robert B.] Zoellick is on this,&#13;
but the whole question of corruption. Do you see that as an issue in the areas&#13;
that you've worked?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Sure, it's an issue. And I've seen a really interesting kind of&#13;
conflict arise, and that is that some people think that the term corruption has&#13;
been expanded to be-to take in just about anything that doesn't involve some&#13;
sort of totally transparent, completely equitable, competitive system where&#13;
all players, you know, have a place at the table. And so there's been a kind&#13;
of-a view of competition that probably exists in places like Norway and&#13;
Finland. And that everything else is corruption.&#13;
&#13;
There has to be a little bit more-a sense-a little bit of a sense of&#13;
proportionality in this. And sure, there's a lot of corruption in developing&#13;
countries. And there's a lot of cases where--you know, I mentioned elite&#13;
capture--there's a lot of cases of when there's bidding on big projects, which&#13;
is something that interests the developed countries particularly. You know,&#13;
all of our procurement rules are really designed, in part, to benefit the&#13;
developed countries, because huge amounts of World Bank funds go into the&#13;
pockets of consultants, contractors, and manufacturers from developed&#13;
countries, and nowadays increasingly from China.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Who then ...&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Well, you know, it looks good because it's development aid, but&#13;
it's going, you know, to buy Toyotas. It's going to pay for hydrologists, and&#13;
it's-you know, and so on, who come from, you know, Part I countries.&#13;
&#13;
Now I'm not saying that's wrong. You know, I think it's necessary in many&#13;
cases. But I think that we need keep our eye on the ball, which is&#13;
development. And I think sometimes we lose sight of it, and we get really,&#13;
really upset and excited about things that look corrupt and which, you know,&#13;
in a certain sense are corrupt, but which, for certain purposes at certain&#13;
times, can be overlooked in the interest of having a project function and&#13;
produce the results that you want.&#13;
&#13;
So, no-so I think that this single-minded micro-focus on corruption as an&#13;
issue can be a bit of a distraction, and it can be unsettling to a country such&#13;
as India where there is corruption. There's bad corruption. You know? You&#13;
know, there are countries with much worse corruption than India, and it's&#13;
intolerable for most of the resources from a World Bank loan to go into the&#13;
pockets of a few rich people. That's terrible. We can't allow that. But we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
also have to be, you know, measured enough to understand that there's going&#13;
to be some leakage. There's going to be some elite capture. And, you know,&#13;
and so we have to be a little bit discriminating and say how much can we&#13;
tolerate if we can achieve some kind of development.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: And so I think that, you know, that the issue has become divisive&#13;
between Part I and Part II countries. It's something that resonates with the&#13;
general public in many countries because what they imagine is that&#13;
developing countries are a gang of thieves. And, I mean, if you go out on the&#13;
street and you ask the average person out on the street here on Pennsylvania&#13;
Avenue, "What's the World Bank?" they'll respond, "Oh, it's an American&#13;
agency that makes loans to countries that never pay it back."&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You know. You say, "Well, wait a minute; it actually belongs to&#13;
I 83 countries."&#13;
&#13;
They answer, "Oh, yeah? Oh, I didn't know that."&#13;
&#13;
"And actually they pay it back. They pay every penny back."&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: You know, "Really?" And people are amazed at that. And people&#13;
say, "Well, how much of the money that you give out-give away actually&#13;
gets to poor people?" which is a reasonable question. But it's said with the-&#13;
with the hidden text behind that is that, you know, all of these developing&#13;
countries are full of corrupt people, and that's why they don't develop:&#13;
because they're full of corrupt people.&#13;
&#13;
It's based on an old sociological concept that was developed by Talcott&#13;
Parsons, and it became very popular in the United States and in Europe that,&#13;
you know, that there were two phases of modern society. One is kind of a,&#13;
you know, a patrimonial state, when everything was ruled by oligarchs;&#13;
everything was clientistic, and everything was ruled by sometimes&#13;
benevolent, but usually very self-interested despots; whereas, a modern&#13;
society totally-fully modern-allows transparency, voice, representation,&#13;
rational conflict resolution, etcetera.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: More rational.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Daniel Gross&#13;
                            April 30, 1008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. where everything is rational and decisions are made-all the&#13;
decisions are made in a rational basis.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I have one last question that I always ask, and that is: given the&#13;
fact international capital markets have changed so much, does the Bank&#13;
remain relevant?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What do you see as the continued relevance of the Bank in this, in&#13;
fact, changed international economic environment?&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: Mm-hmm. Well, there have been some areas of economies around&#13;
the world, such as telecom, where the private sector has come in and has&#13;
provided services so well, so completely, so efficiently that there's really no&#13;
role for the Bank anymore. There's cell phones in just about any country you&#13;
can name .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. and there's no real point in the Bank being involved in that sort&#13;
of thing. If the Bank is going to continue to be involved in telecom, then it&#13;
needs to find its niches very-define its niches very carefully.&#13;
&#13;
The same thing is true of infrastructure. There's a renewed emphasis on&#13;
infrastructure in the Bank now .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. which is good, but again, because of the capacity of the private&#13;
sector to provide infrastructure in, let's say, the 20 most developed-under-&#13;
developed-developing countries-the Brazils, the Mexicos and so on-that&#13;
there the Bank's role should probably be limited more to one of providing&#13;
advice and a limited kind of technical assistance but not trying to finance.&#13;
We're not going to build roads that will satisfy the demand in Mexico or&#13;
pipelines that will, you know, be adequate for Sudan. So I think that's where&#13;
we also need to be very selective.&#13;
&#13;
In other areas, in every country, Â·every developing country, even the so-called&#13;
advanced developing countries like China, India, Russia, Mexico, and Brazil,&#13;
and Argentina, there are very big pockets of poverty. And there I think we&#13;
should be focusing like northeastern Brazil, to a lesser extent the Amazon,&#13;
and urban pockets-pockets of urban poverty, where local policies are not&#13;
contributing to reducing poverty. There again, we need to be judicious about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Daniel Gross&#13;
                             April 30, 2008-Finat Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
where we intervene and how we intervene, you know, but I think we need to&#13;
get away from the idea that we are going to provide the infrastructure that&#13;
countries need.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, I don't believe that we should get out of infrastructure.&#13;
We just need to shift from a provider role to a planning and optimization&#13;
role, introducing new modalities of financing, technology, right-sizing,&#13;
demand management, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
And then there are the poorest countries, mostly the IDA countries, where&#13;
there's no question that the Bank's assistance is needed across the board&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
GROSS: .. in all sectors, you know, in health and education, in urban&#13;
development, in agricultural development, in, you know, in power generation&#13;
and distribution.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, I think that there's still-the Bank's role is still quite relevant.&#13;
It's silly to say that it's just closing your eyes to say that the private sector is&#13;
able to, you know, and private lending agencies are able to take up all the&#13;
slack. That's mainly true for the advanced developing countries, and not&#13;
altogether in them. It's not true for the majority of developing countries.&#13;

            Daniel R. Gross held on April 30, 2008
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In April 2008, Daniel R. Gross was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by William Becker. During his tenure at the
