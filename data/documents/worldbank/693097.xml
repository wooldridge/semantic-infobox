        <abstracts>
            In the early 1990s, Argentina vertically
            separated and privatized most of its electricity industry.
            Transmission and distribution, considered natural
            monopolies, were sold by concession. The main objectives of
            the reforms were efficient pricing and production levels in
            the short term and enough investment to meet demand over the
            longer term. The authors look at the design of the
            regulatory features of the concession contracts and discuss
            the implications for long-term investment in the power sector.
