&#13;
KRASKE: I'm Jochen Kraske, the Bank's historian.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I'm Wilfried Thalwitz, retired vice president ofthe World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Welcome, Wilfried, and thanks for participating in our oral history program. I&#13;
thought that we might want to start first by asking you about your background and your&#13;
education. You are from Germany, and I suppose you have had most of your schooling in&#13;
Germany.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes. I'm from the north ofBavaria, where I finished my high school. I had two&#13;
terms in Frankfurt University, studying economics, but very early in my studies I left Frankfurt&#13;
to go to Berlin. And I did my studies in economics, mostly in Berlin, finishing with the Diploma&#13;
in Economics, in 1957 in Berlin.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Did you at that time focus on developmental issues at all?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes, I started getting interested in development economics by about 1955. I had&#13;
a professor there by the name of [Karl C.] Thalheim, who was one of the few professors in&#13;
Germany reading economic policy, and seminars and research in the area of economic&#13;
development. I was one ofhis students, and in fact, took it as one of the topics for my&#13;
graduation.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Then, you went to India?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: How did that come about, and what were you trying to do in India?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Well, during that period, '55- '57, where I'd begun to read about the economics&#13;
of development, it became very obvious to me that one couldn't do all of this without any sense&#13;
of the reality of a developing country itself. There is much romanticism in Germany associated&#13;
with places like India. I read Siddharta, [Rabindranath] Tagore, and [Friedrich Max] Mueller's&#13;
translations of Indian literature, so there was a combination of literary and cultural interests&#13;
which attracted me to India. I thought I would have an opportunity of seeing a country which&#13;
interested me culturally at the beginning of its economic development&#13;
&#13;
Soon after my exam, I applied for a research scholarship, which took a while to go through. In&#13;
the meantime, I taught in Berlin in a school for aspiring members of the Berlin administration~ It&#13;
was a trade school, and I enjoyed that very much. And finally in 1958, almost a year and four&#13;
months after my exams in Berlin, I made my way to India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wi/fried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. Did you have a particular project, then, that you were trying to complete,&#13;
some study or some paper?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah. I had a project, which dealt mainly with a subject that today I would&#13;
consider an IMF [International Monetary Fund] subject. It dealt with the interaction between the&#13;
short-term monetary policy of a developing country and what today one would call the structural&#13;
aspects; at the time, we called it economic policy, in the more general sense. From the&#13;
beginning, I didn't want to be exclusively a student, at Harvard, LSE [London School of&#13;
Economics] or in Berlin. I wanted that time in India to be as varied as I could make it, and I&#13;
achieved that. I worked with Professor Brahman at Bombay University and an American&#13;
professor by the name of Whittle see on economic and monetary questions.&#13;
&#13;
I did some work in the Reserve Bank of India where I was a permanent guest on agriculture&#13;
credit. I was there when the agriculture credit system of India was invented, and I did some&#13;
research work on it in Rajasthan.&#13;
&#13;
I also worked for industry on a project where Siemens wanted to make a foray into fertilizer&#13;
investment in India which never succeeded. It went so far that I criss-crossed the country in my&#13;
car to take soil samples, which then were taken to the research office in Bombay and were meant&#13;
to give a basis for the future formulations of fertilizers. It was a very interesting thing.&#13;
&#13;
I snapped up the chance, when I had an invitation from the brother of the king of Nepal, who&#13;
asked me to come to Nepal and help a little with the establishment of a planning commission&#13;
there under the first democratic government, and I spent about four months in Nepal doing that.&#13;
So all together, I gained a very broad view of the developmental problems of the sub-continent&#13;
under the guise of a scholarship, but with a lot of private contacts, private research, and work in&#13;
industry and agricultural credit.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: These two professors that you mentioned, were they at the university in Bombay?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: They were at the university in Bombay. Brahman was an interesting man. He's&#13;
still alive. There were others, Dantwallah. V.K.R.V. Rao was in Delhi. We worked together as&#13;
advisers on the third five-year plan, so occasionally I would have to show up in Delhi together&#13;
with Dantwallah. This is all a long time ago.&#13;
&#13;
The third five-year plan, in fact, was a very interesting plan, because for the first time the&#13;
planners did recognize that India had an agriculture, whereas the second five-year plan was an&#13;
almost exclusively industry-oriented plan, in line with the paradigm of the times that only full-&#13;
time and full-scale industrialization gets you out ofthe trap of under-development. We traced&#13;
the loss of foreign exchange; that was very interesting. India had been led into independence&#13;
with a very large nest egg. India had something, ifl can remember the figures right, they had&#13;
something like seventeen billion shilling, they called it at the time. But that all went poof during&#13;
the first and the second five-year plan, and by the time we got to the third five-year plan, there&#13;
was already in India a very hefty foreign exchange crisis, which for a long time never went&#13;
away.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: You were not, then, in touch with the German universities or the German&#13;
establishment, so this was something that you did solely on your own?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes. I was on my own.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: How did you meet the brother of the king ofNepal?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Oh, that's a very private story. The fact is that I took a car from Germany to&#13;
Bombay, and it took me seven weeks through Turkey and Iran, before the World Bank built&#13;
roads in these countries. You had a camet which allowed you tax-free import of a car for one&#13;
year in India. It was the German Automobile Club who guaranteed your good behavior with&#13;
respect to customs, import licenses and all the rest. And every country you went into, you had a&#13;
stamp in your camet, which was a big customs book. When you left the country, you had an out&#13;
stamp. If it was legal to sell the car, you paid the duty and again it became legal that way, and&#13;
then you had to send the camet complete with entry and exit stamps back to the German&#13;
Automobile Club and then it was released from its guarantee of customs duties.&#13;
&#13;
Well, that did not work in India. When my stay was prolonged for another year, my camet ran&#13;
out, and I didn't know what to do with my car. So I went to the Indian Customs and I said, "I'd&#13;
like an import license for a year."&#13;
&#13;
"No, not possible."&#13;
&#13;
"Can I sell the car in India? I am ready to pay the duties and the taxes."&#13;
&#13;
"No, not possible without an import license, you cannot sell the car."&#13;
&#13;
Then I said finally, "Can I drive the car past the Gateway of Bombay into the Arabian Sea?"&#13;
&#13;
And they said, "No, that's also not possible, because it's still Indian Territory."&#13;
&#13;
So, I had to get the car out oflndia before the first twelve months were over. And I had a nice&#13;
Indian girlfriend, who in turn knew the brother of the king of Nepal, and we had a drink together&#13;
in the permit room of the Taj Mahal Hotel and talked about cars and import licenses and&#13;
regulations in general. And he said, "In Nepal there are no such difficulties," and he invited me&#13;
to come to Nepal and sell my car there legally, which I did, and then I got into business.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Okay. So you went to Nepal and got rid of the car.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And sent the stamped document back to the automobile club?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: From Katmandu to Berlin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                       January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So you spent altogether, two years in India.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Two years and two months, inclusive of Nepal which turned out to be almost&#13;
four months. I did some work on setting up a planning commission, so it wasn't only a pleasure&#13;
visit or a visit to get rid of the car. I got into a bit of work there, too. And I must say, it became a&#13;
basis for understanding a country which was much less developed than India itself.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So when you decided to go back your money ran out? Or what made you go back&#13;
after two years?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Well, I had a scholarship initially for one year, then for two years, and after the&#13;
two years it was time to go home. While I was in India, there were two contacts that, in fact,&#13;
determined the rest of my life. One in the Central Bank, where I met the first World Banker who&#13;
happened to be Bill [William] Diamond, who was in Bombay for discussions related to ICICI&#13;
[Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India].&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was living in Bombay at that time.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I don't know whether he was living there, I just remember meeting him there.&#13;
We met once or twice. Then since I had worked briefly in Berlin while waiting for my India trip,&#13;
I was also working in the Economic Council to the Minister of All-German Affairs.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: With whom was that?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: That was Thalheim, again, who was the head of this. We did a study on the&#13;
potential of the re-unification of Germany and the cost thereof which today should be&#13;
particularly interesting. I tried to locate the study and never found it again. But we came up with&#13;
numbers, which were very high. We were talking about $60 billion a year, which, in fact, is not&#13;
too far from the way it turned out. But then there was one colleague of mine, an elderly&#13;
gentleman in that outfit who worked on the re-unification of Germany, who knew Mr. [Willi&#13;
W.A.] Wapenhans, and he suggested, just like Bill Diamond, that I might want to join the World&#13;
Bank. So there were two different strands that were coming together, one through my work in&#13;
Berlin and a colleague there which led to Wapenhans. At the time the Ministry of Economic&#13;
Affairs in Germany was looking for some young Germans to get to the Bank, so they heard&#13;
about the story, and they sent me an application form.&#13;
&#13;
The other strand was the embassy. There was a consul general in Bombay by the name of Hans&#13;
Schmeling, who really thought a much better career than the World Bank would be the German&#13;
Foreign Office. I pursued that for a while and, in fact, upon coming back to Germany from&#13;
India, I took the competitive examination, where they had about 2,500 applications. And I got&#13;
into the last twenty-five or something like that, and we had a four-day grilling, and they accepted&#13;
me. So somewhere in 1961-'62, I was accepted by the German Foreign Office. But I also had&#13;
an offer to come to Paris for interviews with the World Bank. In the end I decided on the World&#13;
Bank. I did not go to diplomacy school in Speyer. It was a little stuffy there, and I thought the&#13;
World Bank was a little more interesting. I don't know today whether I should regret it, but that's&#13;
what I did.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                       January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So this was in 1962. When did you come back from India?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I came back from India in 1961 and went back to working on the unification of&#13;
Germany. In the middle of all this, the wall went up. And it became clear to me that continuing&#13;
to work on the unification of Germany by 1962 was not a proposition with a future, and sadly I&#13;
then revived the two alternatives I had, either the German Foreign Office or the World Bank. I&#13;
made my decision to join the World Bank in the beginning of '63 and arrived here in September.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was this as part ofthe first group of Young Professionals that joined the Bank at&#13;
that time?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes. Actually, that happened after the discussions had started about my joining&#13;
the Bank. I guess they would have taken me without the YP Program, and I was a little old&#13;
already for the program. When I first took up contact and the first interviews were arranged, the&#13;
YP Program was not mentioned. [Donald D.] Fowler was the personnel chief at the time. In&#13;
fact, they were talking about sending me to Africa, into the Africa Department to work on the&#13;
industrialization of Africa with Mr. [John C.] DeWilde. Somewhere in between, the YP&#13;
Program got invented. I think by Dick [Richard H.] Demuth. A coordinator was appointed,&#13;
Dick[Richard W.] van Wagenen, and he wrote to me and said, "We will take you in any case, but&#13;
you could go to Paris for interviews for this YP Program. It may be an interesting story." And I&#13;
did go to Paris where I was interviewed, and they explained in more detail what the YP Program&#13;
was all about. "Junior Professionals," it was called at the time. And I found that very attractive,&#13;
the idea of two years of learning and bringing in what I had learned in India and Nepal and the&#13;
studies I had done before. Getting exposed to a cross-section of different departments in the&#13;
Bank interested me more than working with one particular person in one particular region,&#13;
De Wilde in this case, whom I got to know later. So that's how I got into the Bank: as the oldest&#13;
Junior Professional.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: What were your expectations when you joined the bank? Did you think that you&#13;
were going to spend a major part of your working life working for the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Nowhere near it. In fact, leaving Europe, Berlin and Kiel, where I was living at&#13;
the time, I came half reluctantly. It was the attraction of the World Bank rather than going to&#13;
America that really pulled me here. I remember telling myself, "You have to hold out for those&#13;
two years because you'll learn a lot in those two years as a Junior Professional. And then perhaps&#13;
you can hang on a year or two where you'll use what you've learned." But the time horizon&#13;
never went beyond four years or so, closer to two than to five years, so everything that came later&#13;
was a surprise to me.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And happened bit by bit not in the sense of some grandiose plan.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. There was no grandiose plan. You did your work, somebody came around&#13;
and said, "Here I'm giving you a job, there's something interesting to do here." Later when the&#13;
promotions came, there was an added attraction to it, but mostly whenever I thought about going&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  6&#13;
&#13;
back to Europe, an interesting job came around. So it was not a life plan but a continued&#13;
attraction of new things to do in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I remember your first assignment was with Dick Demuth, who at that time was&#13;
spending much of his time in Geneva, working with or preparing for the first U1~CTAD [United&#13;
Nations Conference on Trade and Development] conference.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. Demuth wasn't himself spending a lot of time on this. In fact, when I came-&#13;
-we were selected in the spring of '63 and we started in September--it was settled from the&#13;
beginning that I would work for him in his department. Now he, in a way, was the inventor of&#13;
the Young Professional Program, and I had a lot of experience in developing countries, and he&#13;
knew what I had studied and thought he could use me for some of the think tank work he was&#13;
still doing in '63.&#13;
&#13;
This was the beginning of the [George D.] Woods regime, and he sensed that Woods would be&#13;
open to some new ideas. He had had quite a lot of influence, Demuth, putting his two pennies&#13;
worth in on IFC [International Finance Corporation] and the Young Professional Program, I&#13;
think also on IDA [International Development Association]. So he considered himself some sort&#13;
of a brain trust in the Bank, and he wanted me for that kind of work. His rapport never turned&#13;
out to be as deep with Woods as it had been with [Eugene R.] Black, and the department didn't&#13;
go much into the strategic planning for the Bank because he was getting out of this a little bit. So&#13;
the nitty-gritty part of the Bank work became more important That was the relations with the&#13;
U.N., the technical assistance cooperation, etc. There were people like [James E., Jr.] Twining&#13;
and [Munir P.] Benjenk working in his department, who were also being taken away from the&#13;
strategic thinking work for the Bank to do the nitty-gritty work, and that's what I fell into.&#13;
&#13;
At that time, the conference on trade and development was to take place in Geneva in the spring&#13;
of 1964. There was never a decision that Demuth would go there. He selected Arthur Karasz,&#13;
who was the former head of the Hungarian Central Bank, who had been kicked out and was&#13;
another one of those now needed for nitty-gritty work, so he was appointed together with an&#13;
Ecuadorian, Echeveria, I think, was his name. Demuth never declared who was the official&#13;
representative of the World Bank at the Conference for Trade and Development in Geneva. The&#13;
three of us were shipped off for three and a half months to live in Geneva for the duration of the&#13;
conference. My two bosses were very jealous of each other and couldn't agree with each other.&#13;
Karasz, the more substantial person gradually took over, but they still couldn't agree on who&#13;
would sit in the official chair of the World Bank, so often I, the Young Professional, ended up&#13;
sitting in the chair with the two of them behind me.&#13;
&#13;
Other than meeting interesting people, I didn't learn much at that conference, apart from meeting&#13;
interesting people like Ted [Edward R.G.] Heath and Che Guevara. The only tangible element&#13;
of it was the creation ofUNCTAD and UNIDO [United Nations Industrial Development&#13;
Organization], agencies that are now being looked at again, but these were the elements that&#13;
came out after three and a half months of talking.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now there were a number of recommendations and requests that came out of the&#13;
conference which were addressed to the Bank. One had to do with the creation of commodity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
funds to stabilize commodity prices and support countries when commodity prices took a&#13;
downturn. There was also, I think, a study on debt and indebtedness. Were you involved in any&#13;
of this?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No, we shared the work a little bit, I was in the so-called second committee at the&#13;
time, which was the committee on industry, the paradigm of the time. There was demand&#13;
essentially for what was called then a more balanced industrial development with a recognition&#13;
that it should be the right of the developing countries to industrialize behind higher tariff barriers,&#13;
in contrast to the industrialized countries which in 1964 were not ready for complete trade&#13;
liberalization either. So it was a committee looking at the combination of industry and trade&#13;
policy, very much hampered by the philosophy at the time that trade policy was an active&#13;
instrument of development policy of under-developed countries and that there had to be a trade&#13;
policy as an element for "rectifYing the nature of trade relations between the richer and the&#13;
developing countries." Not much came out of this. Much of that philosophy entered into the&#13;
UNCTAD day-to-day operations. Much of it came from [Raul] Prebisch, who was a supporter&#13;
of Latin American import substitution strategies. Countries like the United States, which were&#13;
much more liberal and could afford to be liberal in their trade policy at that time, never were very&#13;
interested in that kind of development.&#13;
&#13;
The idea that you mentioned of a commodity fund was taken up by the Bank, not under any kind&#13;
of instructions, but it became a topic which Irving Friedman took up under Woods. Following a&#13;
stint with Demuth, I went for quite a while to work for Irving Friedman with a group of four&#13;
people, Eugenio Lari was there, [Ravi] Gulhati and [Rudolf] Hablutzel. He then asked us to put&#13;
together a proposal for what today we call compensatory finance. It was program lending where&#13;
some relations had to be established between the financing base of a five-year plan--everybody&#13;
accepted five-year plans--and the prospective financing base out of exports or out of normal&#13;
capital flows. The proposal dealt with calamities that would disturb the fmancial base of a well&#13;
thought out investment and policy program--a five-year plan. The Bank would then have a fund&#13;
that would kick in compensatory finance, essentially program ending, on the basis of gauging the&#13;
policies and the investment content of a country's plan, setting it against the disturbance which&#13;
disrupted the financing plan. This could be a drought, shifts in terms of trade, the dropping out&#13;
of an erstwhile trusted aid finance source, and the Bank would temporarily assist with program&#13;
lending. It's an idea that was taken up fifteen years later by the IMF under a compensatory&#13;
financing scheme, but the Bank did not adopt it.&#13;
&#13;
I remember at the time I was selected at the end of my YP Program, what I very much wanted to&#13;
do was to get my hands dirty and join a projects department. They had arranged for me to come&#13;
to the Transportation Department. When we walked out of the Roger Smith Hotel after the first&#13;
lunch I had with my future bosses, they were not very pleased that I had tried to mess up the&#13;
decent project approach of the Bank by considering such a thing as program and policy based&#13;
lending as compensatory finance, which threatened to disturb the tried and trusted practices of&#13;
the Bank. They acted like they had very much second thoughts about taking me on after this&#13;
stint in compensatory finance.&#13;
&#13;
In the '80s, when I was in A:frica--1 even tried it in India, which got me nowhere-- we first&#13;
discussed the idea of policy changes related in some way to non-project lending. Having gone in&#13;

                       January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     8&#13;
&#13;
1965 through the thought process of this interaction between economic policy and balance of&#13;
payments--even if it was under this awful paradigm that everybody had to have a five-year plan&#13;
and development had to be government led--there was something to fall back on for me, which&#13;
was a good thing, for the work I did in the '80s.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's go back again. Do you remember when&#13;
Woods came and addressed the UNCTAD conference? Were you there when it happened?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah, I was there when it happened, but I have absolutely no memory of it. I&#13;
was so concentrated on my committee. He spoke in the plenary. I have no recollection of what&#13;
he said at the time.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Nor do you have any recollection about what sort of relationship he had with Karasz&#13;
at that time?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I thought that they were quite close.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I thought they were very close, and he was the one who, after all, appointed Karasz&#13;
as the head of the Paris office. But then there was a point when Woods was absolutely refusing&#13;
to see Karasz or to have anything to do with him. I was wondering whether there might have&#13;
been something that went awry in Geneva.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No idea. It was cordial in Geneva during the conference in '64. By the time the&#13;
events of which you speak happened, and this is the first time I hear about them, I was long&#13;
involved with the nitty-gritty of importing pile drivers and laying bases for roads.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So you came back after the conference in the spring of'64, and then you went on a&#13;
second assignment with Friedman?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: That was the second assignment with Irving Friedman, which was supposed to&#13;
last for six months like any other assignment, but it lasted for over a year, I think. And in fact for&#13;
then we had a third assignment, which was an assignment in the Transportation Department.&#13;
This, however, was supposed to blend into a permanent assignment in transportation projects, so&#13;
I don't exactly know when my existence as a Junior Professional ended and when the transport&#13;
economist life started, except for a formal action form I must have received at that stage. I don't&#13;
remember the event. From day one I went into this and worked as ifi was going to stay there&#13;
forever.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I take it Bimal Jalan was then also working in Friedman's office?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah. Bimal Jalan was the secretary ofthe Economic Committee. He was not&#13;
part of this four-person group of which I spoke earlier that did particular policy research. We&#13;
actually had to write a book about it. But my relation with Bimal was fairly close because I saw&#13;
all the papers that would go to the Economic Committee, and there were people like [Andrew&#13;
M.] Kamarck and [Dragoslav] A vramovic, with whom we had a lot of contact in the old&#13;
economic department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                       January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Hans Schmidt was there, also?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah, but I didn't see much ofhim. We had a very specific task, which was this&#13;
program lending compensatory finance in relation to five-year planning, trade and financial&#13;
flows. That was the major item of our work, but then we often attended the Economic&#13;
Committee.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. And you stayed there until this was finished, even though it never went&#13;
anywhere?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Well, it got published. The projects department people and most ofthe people&#13;
who advised Woods at the time came to the conclusion that the Bank wasn't ready to step over its&#13;
boundaries in terms of organized program lending. That was the reaction of Warren Baum and&#13;
others like him, Mario Piccagli, who was the head of the utilities department. In my search for&#13;
getting my feet and my hands dirty, I had also tried the utilities department as power always&#13;
interested me. So I went to him and after he talked for a while he said, "I'm not going to have a&#13;
long-haired economist ruin my well-run projects department." That was it; he didn't want any&#13;
micro or macro economist.&#13;
&#13;
Such people gave Woods an absolutely cold shower about any expansion into program lending.&#13;
I thought he had much more of an open eye, but the establishment in the Bank just could not&#13;
picture it. Another reason why it didn't go anywhere was because Friedman was thinking like a&#13;
hybrid of the Bank and the Fund and much of what we did under this study entered territory that&#13;
I think, rightly, belonged to the Fund. So this contributed to the fact that the Bank did not take&#13;
up program lending at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, I think that sporadic forays into program lending were not thought to be&#13;
impossible. It was the establishment of a regular window that would have its own rules which&#13;
was the issue, the openness with which the Bank would move into this program lending business,&#13;
and the laying down of the criteria by which it would be done. It took another fifteen years until&#13;
this was even convenient and legitimate to talk about. We were ten years too early.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right, although circumstances compelled the Bank at the time to take up program&#13;
lending on a regular basis as a regular part of the program in India, Pakistan, and still later in&#13;
Bangladesh. Circumstances really pushed the Bank in this direction early on.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: But that's very different. The Bank for doing what it did in India never had to&#13;
declare that it had a set of policies, a facility that we could be separately financed, that had&#13;
general rules of application. There was program lending in the '60s only on the sub-continent&#13;
and nowhere else. It was a much more ad hoc approach and therefore much easier to get by the&#13;
Board [ofExecutive Directors].&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right, although the fact that program lending was unconditional in that sense was&#13;
due more to the fact that the people at the receiving .end absolutely refused to have any kind of&#13;
trade between reform and money. It had less to do with the willingness of the Part I countries to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
support such an approach. I think if anything program lending would have become much more&#13;
popular at the time if there had been rules and some kind of clear linkage to policy reform.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I think you are right. I was thinking about the resistance against such an idea&#13;
from within the Bank and also shareholders and the entry into the IMF territory. What you are&#13;
adding in here is, were the potential borrowers ready to accept such a scheme?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Well, we never had a chance to test that as it got killed by the establishment in&#13;
the Bank and by the resistance of the Fund and the shareholders who wanted this over in the&#13;
Fund. But you're right: the only policy reference we had in those loans and that developing&#13;
countries in our discussions were ready to accept was a judgment on the quality of the public&#13;
investment program and the policies surrounding it in the underlying five-year plan. This was&#13;
the closest you could come at the time to judging the expenditures by the developing countries&#13;
themselves and the way in which they would be spent.&#13;
&#13;
There was a very funny experience. At the time that we were working at it, the Bank had an&#13;
operation in Peru over which a number of shareholders were a little concerned, including the&#13;
United States. Mr. Woods went and checked with the Treasury, and from there it went to the&#13;
White House, and the White House eventually came back saying that it was alright for the Bank&#13;
to go in there, provided they have a good five-year plan. Nothing gives you a better idea of the&#13;
change of the paradigm. The Treasury and the White House, in the middle of the 1960s, saying&#13;
that the sense of the policy aspects and the quality of investment you can get is by looking at the&#13;
five-year plan. If the five-year plan was good, you could continue investing. But that's as far as&#13;
it went in the '60s.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Although some of the five-year plans, notably the Indian five-year plan, had&#13;
chapters or components that laid down in a fair amount of detail some of the specific policies&#13;
such as controls, investment, price controls, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Exactly. Sure. Treatment of the private sector, financial flows, sharing between&#13;
public and private sector, all financial flows, savings applications, it was all there.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So to that extent it wasn't just a question of the quality of planning that was at issue&#13;
here, but the focus was on economic policies even then.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No, that's exactly what I'm saying. The funny thing is that the content of those&#13;
policies and the distribution of investments between the state and the private sector at the time&#13;
made out of the five-year plans what is essentially a copy or an adaptation of a Russian gross&#13;
plan to the concept of development. The funny thing is that still in the '60s, the United States&#13;
Treasury or the White House or the Brits or the Germans, for that matter, saw in a good five-year&#13;
plan, with all its prohibitions of private sector activity, pre-allocation of financial flows to the&#13;
state, and limitations on trade, a guarantee that a country was husbanding its resources and&#13;
moving forward in development. So it wasn't a question of content or whether you liked that&#13;
content.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                       January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I don't think that is totally correct. I remember certainly in the case of the&#13;
[Bernard R.] Bell mission there was a great deal of discussion about the appropriateness of&#13;
policies and controls, the need to change the whole price system and to move in the direction of&#13;
greater liberalization and decentralization and de-regulation. But it is true that the concept of a&#13;
plan was taken as something that was essential. Nobody could conceive of a developing country&#13;
moving along just driven by market forces.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Or indirect control policies. It had to be direct.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah, incentives were lost sight of. So presumably and precisely because you had&#13;
this extensive exposure first to the UNCTAD conference and then to Irving Friedman and his&#13;
kind of brainy ideas, you had this desire to move into the real world of the World Bank, that is to&#13;
say the project department. If anything, this was enhanced then by your experience?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah. I felt I was getting one-sided.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So it was a deliberate career step on your part that if you wanted to be in the World&#13;
Bank, you wanted to be where the action is, out in the field with the projects people in the real&#13;
world.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now, at that point, I suppose, you were also beginning to look at your existence in&#13;
the Bank in a somewhat longer-term timeframe?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Two more years.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I remember at that point you were beginning to eye the potential for&#13;
promotions and for moving up in the system?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No? Well, I remember that you, and by that time [[Edward V.K.] Jaycox, who had&#13;
also joined, would take these trips down to the personnel department and bang on the table.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No, the trips down to the personnel department were the collective effort of the&#13;
Junior Professionals who felt that they were treated like slaves, underpaid, overworked, under-&#13;
attended. Our trips down there were not promotion ideas or longer-term life--and this was more&#13;
in 1964 or beginning of'65. This was not long-term planning, this was not looking at promotion,&#13;
this was essentially that we were YPs now, Junior Professionals, complaining that the Bank was&#13;
not making the best use of us. Do it better, pay us better, give us a better chance of having some&#13;
influence, and that's why we complained. No, the promotion idea didn't get into my head until&#13;
1970 or so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Anyway, so you stepped into the world of project appraisals and project&#13;
supervisions, and it turned out to be transport. And that was in part because public utilities did&#13;
not want you and transport, at that time was with Warren Baum, wanted you and asked for you?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah. I had no particular love for either utilities or transportation. Agriculture&#13;
was still very small, and I had not much of a connection to it at that time, except my fertilizer&#13;
work, and a bit of agriculture credit, which in turn wasn't taken up in the Bank, so it had to be&#13;
pretty clearly infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
The basic idea behind this was that I had learned one additional lesson in my work with&#13;
Friedman, namely that this Bank was going to be for a long time an investment institution. It&#13;
would write fat economic reports to determine the environment under which these investments&#13;
would have to survive. It would have a strong country relations aspect with the decision-makers&#13;
in the borrowing countries, which would be exclusively government officials, but this was going&#13;
to be an investment banking institution for quite a while to come. I had tested and seen that the&#13;
Bank as a policy advising institution was still weak, didn't have the analytical capacity nor the&#13;
political oomph to pursue it and no shareholder support for it. So the combination of my own&#13;
interests in walking around in India, in Rajasthan, seeing agricultural cooperatives, doing the soil&#13;
samples for a fertilizer factory, checking what went on in the marshalling yards of the Indian&#13;
railways, and the recognition that the Bank was not going to be the IMF, left me with two&#13;
choices. I said to myself, "If you want to stay on the policy side and do monetary and fiscal&#13;
policy, go to the IMF. If you stay in the World Bank, then you get your feet dirty and you get&#13;
into investments and you go where the investments happen." And that was the projects&#13;
department. And yes, you are right, I got nowhere on the utilities side. I went from door to door&#13;
and said, "Take me, I'm interested. I know nothing of what you're doing, but take me, teach me."&#13;
And it turned out that the transportation department was the only one among the then projects&#13;
departments who really wanted to look at economics as part of the investment decision. And that&#13;
was where Warren Baum, who had come from the area department, assembled people like Hans&#13;
Adler, Vince [Vincent W.] Hogg, Sei-Young Park.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: [Herman G.] van der Tak?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: Vander Tak came later, and he came in sideways from the center. There was&#13;
now a group of people who were very keen on not being just an engineering department, a&#13;
development which took much longer in the utilities department to go through. And yet, when I&#13;
went on my first mission, I went to Peru to the port of Pisco. I had done my homework, read all&#13;
the consultants' reports, there was a financial analysis, a dredging and a pile driving analysis, but&#13;
not a word about economics in there. So I went on the plane with a financial analyst who was&#13;
British and a port engineer who was Norwegian. On this long flight, I asked my chief of mission,&#13;
"Are we going to Peru" --I had no terms of reference--"for the appraisal of a port project? What's&#13;
my function?"&#13;
&#13;
And the mission leader said, "We got ourselves a nice project, but we need somebody to justify it&#13;
after we've made the decision. You're here to write chapter five-- the economic justification."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                       January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I was a little peeved, because they were obviously not interested in what I would have to say,&#13;
there were no alternatives being considered, this was the ex-post justification. I later introduced&#13;
some modifications, because this was a fishing port, had a lot to do with the landing of fish for&#13;
fish meal, which gave a big boost to the U.S. chicken industry. In the process, they over-fished&#13;
the Humboldt stream, and the Humboldt stream did the disfavor of moving further west, but the&#13;
port became so incredibly profitable that all the investment got paid back within a few years,&#13;
which a later OED [Operations Evaluation Department] report showed.&#13;
&#13;
But I'm telling you this story for one reason. Proceeding from working with Friedman close to&#13;
the IMF, policy work, monetary and fiscal issues, capital streams, to getting your feet wet was&#13;
not an easy thing at all because of the divorce of the policy and economic analysis on the one&#13;
hand from the decision-making on the other. To many those two elements--the physics of&#13;
constructing a port, and the economic and policy environment affecting the decision--took us&#13;
another five years to have it fully accepted. And it eouldn't have happened without Warren&#13;
Baum.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He supported this work and your role in particular, very much?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And he also understood what the issues were and that you had to look at?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: He was a fantastic boss. Just right for me and, in a way, right for the Bank. Had&#13;
you taken a micro-economist--somebody like Vince Hogg, who went to Northwest, which was&#13;
the only university in the United States where you really did transport economics--had you taken&#13;
the transport economist and put them in charge of the transportation projects department, you&#13;
would not have had the effect in terms of changing the culture of the Bank that you got by taking&#13;
a country economist, which is what Warren was, and which later [A. David] Knox and [Mervyn&#13;
L.] Weiner were. These were substantial economists with country experience, and they were as&#13;
eager to learn the micro-economics--even in collaboration with the engineers and the financial&#13;
analysts--as some of us younger guys tried to apply some economic rationale to the choice&#13;
between investments.&#13;
&#13;
So, in fact, if somebody did it well, like Warren did, he forged a new approach and a new team.&#13;
He integrated the engineers who were sometimes puzzled as to why they had to jump through&#13;
these hoops. But he integrated them into the making of choices by economic means. He could&#13;
make clear to them that you had to check the macro-economic consequence before you decided&#13;
which business policy you wanted to pursue. And things fell into place.&#13;
&#13;
Young economists, even Hans Adler who was young at the time, fitted into this by translating&#13;
their macro-motivation into micro-economic analysis--fitted as a result into a team with the&#13;
engineers and fmancial analysts. It took about two or three years. Baum was ruthless--anybody&#13;
who didn't play at this, he let them feel it. But he was very successful.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was then new, not just in the Bank, but generally, also in investment planning&#13;
and evaluation?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah, I had a chance to compare what we were doing in the Bank with my rather&#13;
deep knowledge of the third five-year plan in India. Most of the techniques we used were used&#13;
at universities. There were adaptations from the financial analysis techniques like internal rate of&#13;
return calculations with the economic modifications. No five-year plan ever applied to them&#13;
across the board, because you didn't have the yardstick for intersectoral comparisons. It was&#13;
known and used in the public investment analysis as a counter-check but not as a means of&#13;
determining the composition of an entire investment plan. And to this day we haven't done it.&#13;
There never has been developed a methodology to use micro analysis for comparative purposes&#13;
for the establishment of a public sector investment program. There is no yardstick for&#13;
intersectoral comparisons. But the methodologies on the micro side were known but had not&#13;
been applied, so we applied them together with the financial analysts who provided a lot of the&#13;
raw data.&#13;
&#13;
What was even newer but had not been done at all was the analysis of the sectoral policy&#13;
environment. It started with some very simple things that bug us still today, such as the question&#13;
of tariffs or of consumer surpluses. How do you price away an added advantage you give to a&#13;
consumer because the country indebted itself vis-a-vis the World Bank to make an investment&#13;
for his benefit? How much of a consumer surplus do you generate that way? How do you price&#13;
it away? In other words, how to create a siphoning mechanism which supports the sectoral&#13;
policy environment and financing capacity. That was new; it had not been done before. Warren&#13;
did lots to introduce that. And then people like van der Tak came in to elaborate the methods.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So this is then a question of what sort of tolls and fees and tariffs you should&#13;
charge?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: That's the pricing away mechanism. Or how, for example, are the users&#13;
organized? As the provider of a public investment this should interest you. I remember the&#13;
assessment of the Indian trucking industry when you had the question, "Should you invest more&#13;
in roads or in the railway? Under what policy environment does the Indian trucking industry&#13;
operate?" The only question an engineer would ever ask was, "Will the bridge stay up?" But&#13;
there was much more than the question of, "What is the railway tariff for a ton of grain going&#13;
from the Punjab to Madras?" That was only one important question. But the second question&#13;
was, "Is there competition? How is the trucking industry organized? What's the role of the state&#13;
in keeping it the way it is organized? Is it efficient or not?" Then came questions such as,&#13;
"What is the tax system? How is it operating?"&#13;
&#13;
In fact, when I was working on the railways in India, I had made an assessment of the trucking&#13;
industry. I was allowed to look at the books of a trucking firm in Delhi and found an entry that&#13;
said in beautiful Kipling English, "elimination of adverse administrative barriers." So I asked the&#13;
accountant could he tell me what did this represent, and it was a sizeable sum. He said, "Sir, this&#13;
is what we put into the pockets of our drivers to avoid octroi." This was not the first time I had&#13;
heard the word octroi, because when I went to India, I once got stranded and a truck had to pull&#13;
me into Indore, and I had to pay octroi. Then I learned that the relative position of the railways&#13;
in India had a lot to do with the taxing system on the roads. Octroi taxes were forbiddingly high.&#13;
The railways were interested in keeping it that way, they didn't pay octroi, and the trucking firms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
responded by a formal entry in the books for bribes, to minimize the cost for the administrative&#13;
inconveniences of the truck going from Delhi to Madras.&#13;
&#13;
This is how we worked. You started out with the question, "Do they need in the Indian railways&#13;
35,000 wagons? What's the economic analysis of this?" Before you knew it, you had to ask&#13;
yourself, "What's the investment policy on competing modes of transport? What's the policy&#13;
environment? What's the taxation system? Who maintains the roadway for the railways? Are&#13;
they screwing themselves in the railways?" And then we widened this. It became interesting&#13;
when we hit on the boundaries of macro policies, which we often did. Then we had to talk to our&#13;
colleagues, the macro economists, and they were very often puzzled as to why we were coming&#13;
up with these funny questions when we were dealing with so many railway ties.&#13;
&#13;
In some regions there was much more response than in others. I remember in Latin America,&#13;
there was [Roger] Chaufoumier, [Gerald] Alter, and they snapped it up immediately. In Asia, I&#13;
once had a discussion with [I. Peter M.] Cargill. I thought he'd throw me and my boss out. That&#13;
was his territory, he was worried about it in the first place, he wanted us to lay ties the railways&#13;
could go over. It was very interesting, so it became the subject of a new tension within the Bank,&#13;
a tension which I almost liked that it existed because when you really took the micro-investing&#13;
job seriously--and I was sure the World Bank would remain a micro investment place for a long&#13;
time--you couldn't close your eyes to the economic policy questions.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now, you did this for three years; you started at the end of'65?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah, middle '65, for three and a half Then I went to Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah. In '69, I guess, you went to Indonesia. This was the period that you spent in&#13;
the transportation department. Did you feel that you had attained a certain proficiency in what&#13;
you were doing? At the same time, of course, as you described just now, the territory was&#13;
expanding. There were new issues, the scope of the work was widening. But you felt that you&#13;
had attained a certain proficiency?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And you were becoming restless and wanted to move on to other things?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. Not at all. In fact, I felt that ifl wanted to stay in America, I could have&#13;
another five to ten years in that field and I would still not get bored--I would still learn there.&#13;
&#13;
Give you another example at that time. In, I think it was 1966, long before Indonesia, we still&#13;
had economic reports, and I went on an economic mission to Algeria headed by [Dragoslav]&#13;
Avramovic, and shortly thereafter I went to Mauritania. That was work for the investment bank&#13;
as part of a macro team. We ended up with these fat reports. We were five people in Algeria for&#13;
transport alone, [Hendrik] van Heiden, [Francis C.] Soges, some sectorial expert, but I very&#13;
quickly got through to Drag and Eugenio Lari, who was working for him, and we got to the&#13;
question, "What does this country really want? What kind of policies does it want to pursue?&#13;
How does my field, power, relate to these objectives?" And there was a Filipino girl, who was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                       January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
one of the first oil experts in the Bank and Algeria was an oil and gas country. And there the&#13;
question of having limited resources was, "Do you develop the industry as a state property, do&#13;
you go for gas liquification, gas transport, or do you invite international oil companies to defray&#13;
that investment for you and you put your money into infrastructure?" In the end, they wanted to&#13;
do it all by themselves, including new steel factories. All these questions were on the table in&#13;
this newly independent country, very much different from the questions faced by Korea or even&#13;
India. There was a completely new set of options for this country, which was from day one an&#13;
oil and gas country with a very socialist government that wanted to do all of it, steel factories,&#13;
glass factories, everything to be run by the state. In particular, the government did not let the&#13;
private sector in on the oil side, which could have been royaled and taxed away, and then used&#13;
for infrastructure. These were choices the government did not want to make. I knew in 1966&#13;
that there was trouble brewing in those areas, and I told A vramovic at the time that I see the&#13;
transport side here but I also see the oil and gas side, and there is a choice here. If they really&#13;
want to invest in the gas development, all by themselves or with some French help, and if they&#13;
want to modernize their infrastructure--some of it was overdeveloped already by the French and&#13;
so it had to be maintained--other investments such as in telecommunications had to be made.&#13;
Therefore, if the government wants to do the hydrocarbon sectors and infrastructure itself and&#13;
then go into industry, the government is going to be in severe financial trouble in spite of the oil&#13;
sales. I told the Algerians that, and A vramovic knew it was true.&#13;
&#13;
You can't imagine how exciting it was to switch from, let's say, a desert road in Niger, and on the&#13;
next mission to the Nasca-Cuzco Road in Peru, back to Peru the second time, then suddenly in&#13;
Algeria to face this question, "Where does this country really go, and how do the sectoral&#13;
components fit into this overall strategy?" So I thought I was learning from these engineers and&#13;
from the financial engineers. I was expanding the field of micro-economics, as well as&#13;
maintaining contact with the macro questions. I thought I could do this forever. This is a long&#13;
answer to your question. I was not restless. I was happy.&#13;
&#13;
Then out of the blue came this call from Bernie Bell saying, "You will go to Indonesia."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "How can you say that? I'm happy here."&#13;
&#13;
So he said, "Mr. McNamara has given me a hunting license and anybody I ask should go, and&#13;
the bosses of the people I ask have absolutely no chance of preventing me from taking those&#13;
people, and I'm reporting to McNamara direct, so you're it for transport."&#13;
&#13;
I really didn't want to go. I had been to India, then Nepal, I didn't want to live in a developing&#13;
country again. I didn't know what Indonesia was like, so I negotiated a one-year contract. I said,&#13;
"I have enough in-country experience, I'm still learning a lot here." So they gave me a one-year&#13;
contract. I went to Indonesia and stayed for a year and a half.&#13;
&#13;
Essentially, then, Indonesia became what Algeria was. Ifyou put in the port of Pisco project, the&#13;
Indian railways, and the Niger Road, it was an emerging country, emerging out of the mess&#13;
created by Sukarno, with one task: getting decent investment going in an overall framework that&#13;
lets these investments reasonably succeed. That is what we did in Indonesia. Nothing special&#13;
could have been done in Algeria. The special thing about Indonesia was that McNamara adopted&#13;
&#13;

                       January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the country--the lines of communication went straight back to him--and the government accepted&#13;
us almost like a shadow government. Very different from India and Peru; the Indonesians&#13;
accepted us and wanted our advice.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: There was also very much of a personal aspect to it, in the sense that Bernie Bell&#13;
knew the characters there from way back. They liked him and took to him.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: You're absolutely right, I mean, you had known Bell much better than I would&#13;
because of the Bell mission to India. But had the Indonesians not known him before, it would&#13;
have worked just as well, because the personalities fitted so nicely. Bernie Bell was extremely&#13;
helpful and so unimposing. He would be called in by these people or would bring us along, and&#13;
they would ask us what to do--they often had some ideas. Rather than jumping out and saying,&#13;
"That's how I think it should be done," or "I'll do a study," which was already then very much&#13;
the arrogant style of the World Bank, he did none of that. He would sit and make you feel that&#13;
he was thinking with you. He would ask a little counter-question--feeding his machinery with&#13;
added information. So it's true, as you said, that some of the guys knew each other, but more&#13;
importantly, their personalities fit so perfectly. And it became fairly easy for us younger guys,&#13;
like Tony [Anthony] Churchill, who was not always easy, Heinz Vergin, [John C.] Lithgow, who&#13;
did the power part, Tom [Thomas C.] Creyke (I think was his name) in agriculture, and I was&#13;
alone on transport. This became a very close-knit team, very well led by Bernie, beautifully&#13;
accepted by the Indonesians, but with a lot of hardship. I didn't live as well in '69-'70 in&#13;
Indonesia as I had lived '59 in India. We had a deputy head of mission who made our lives&#13;
miserable.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Alfred Matter? Counted every postage stamp?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Postage stamp, door knobs, he went into international competitive bidding on&#13;
door knobs. And we stayed longer in the hotel, paying high prices, because he couldn't bear the&#13;
thought that some Chinese would rip him off in selling him too expensive a door knob.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Bernie more or less let you each handle your sectors? He wasn't really interfering&#13;
much?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No, he wasn't interfering much and because of that he got what he expected. I&#13;
tried to learn from every one of these managers how they functioned. I learned one thing from&#13;
him, which I kept to the last day of my own work. He always knew more about what you were&#13;
doing than he would let you proudly know. He would read something from headquarters about&#13;
transport, he would read a draft of mine, and let me go on. But when I came asking for help, I&#13;
would suddenly realize that he had been learning along with me, and when I needed him he was&#13;
ready to respond. He waited until I came to him, and I recognized that he expected that I would&#13;
come to him. I was very impressed with the way he had no interest in showing off his&#13;
knowledge. He would just wait, absorb some knowledge, store it somewhere, and use it for you&#13;
when you came to him.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was, of course, also a very opportune and fortunate time to have him come in&#13;
and give economic advice to a set of people who had been through a disastrous experience and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  18&#13;
&#13;
who were ready to discard any prejudices and look at things pragmatically and in a practical&#13;
way.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And so in that sense, it was really a very, very unique situation. Political obstacles&#13;
didn't exist, or were not, at least, of a significant order. And I suppose at that point, also, the&#13;
negative aspects of the laissez-faire regime in Indonesia, the extent of corruption and so on had&#13;
not yet manifested itself?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: You're right, but yet I must give some credit to the Indonesians. Their situation&#13;
was unique. Everybody was fed up with the mess that Sukarno had created. Sukarno was gone.&#13;
There was domestic civil strife, with a lot of killing going on, particularly of the Chinese.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Even while you were there?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: It was just behind us. There was still some going on. There was still witch-&#13;
hunting of Communists.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Contrasts! There were hundreds ofthousands of Chinese who had been butchered.&#13;
And yet here in the U.S. nobody ever said anything, and here, now, you have Harry Wu going&#13;
around complaining that the Chinese use prisoners to build Bank projects and everybody is up in&#13;
arms.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Well, communications weren't like today. There was no television. I still saw&#13;
some blood in the rivers. But you're right, altogether there was a starting situation with very&#13;
unfortunate experiences, which people wanted to put behind them. There was this incredible&#13;
desire to be normal and developing: getting rid of Sukarno, putting an end to the butchering and&#13;
to the Communist witch-hunt, and focus instead on the economy. Some of this still went on .&#13;
while I was there.&#13;
&#13;
The Algerians weren't all that much different. They had a war ofliberation, they'd fought the&#13;
French for so many years, and they had a civil war among themselves. They had well educated&#13;
people, socialists, why didn't they do what the Indonesians did?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, ideologically, they first had to the other route.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: And they started fighting with each other very quickly. By the time we got there,&#13;
Ali [Ahmed Ben Bella] was out, [Houari] Boumedienne had just taken over, so they weren't as&#13;
easy and free to accept a Bernie Bell and his team. And they weren't ready themselves as the&#13;
Indonesians were to say, "Look, we will need all this help, and occasionally, we will have to&#13;
jump over our sovereignty problem.'' Why didn't they do it? Why did they not do it in Latin&#13;
America? How many problems did we have in Tanzania at the time? How much of this was&#13;
ideological, how much of this was inherent in the political structure of society, I don't know. But&#13;
it was not easy for the Indonesians, either.&#13;

                                      Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Welcome back, Wilfried. When we left, we were in Indonesia talking about the&#13;
purpose of the mission, the conditions of Indonesia at the time, and the peculiarities of Bernie&#13;
Bell, who was the mission leader. I thought you might want to say something briefly about&#13;
the particular tasks that you were performing, presumably as a transport economist and&#13;
advisor in the resident mission. Also, what then led you to come back from Indonesia? Did&#13;
you complete a particular report? Was there some task that you had to perform before they&#13;
would let you go back again?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Right. On the last question, I did not exactly volunteer to go to Indonesia.&#13;
Bernie Bell had an open recruitment license and none ofthe bosses could say no, which made&#13;
it equally difficult for the targeted persons to say no. I was a bachelor and had just begun&#13;
getting somewhere in the transportation department, where there were relatively few&#13;
economists. When Bell selected me, I knew pretty well that I could not just say no. But I had&#13;
an arrangement with Bernie, which was endorsed by McNamara, that I would go for one year.&#13;
Since I was a bachelor, that wasn't too expensive for the Bank. Everybody was hoping that I&#13;
would extend, but they took me under those conditions.&#13;
&#13;
As you implied in your question, I had a very specific field and was responsible in the&#13;
resident mission for everything concerning transportation. In a way, this was like one&#13;
enormous extended economic mission with one added feature. Quite apart from the analytical&#13;
work that an economic mission does from the macro to the systemic to the sectoral&#13;
considerations, there was a day-to-day advisory function vis-a-vis the government. The&#13;
resident mission in Indonesia was expected by the government from the beginning to have a&#13;
tight working relationship with the various government departments that tried post-&#13;
Communist reform. There were some very capable U.S.-educated people, but without&#13;
experience in the practicalities of development.&#13;
&#13;
I had a dual reporting relationship: within the Bank with Bernie Bell and the Asia region and&#13;
within Indonesia in the advisory function with the Minister of Transport, Mr. Frans Seda, and&#13;
with the Planning Commission since the entire mission was housed in BAPPENAS [Badan&#13;
Perencanaan dan Pembangunan Nasional; National Development Planning Agency]. This&#13;
wasn't always easy as there was some friction between the technical ministers involved in the&#13;
execution of their functions and the planning advice that the planning commission extended.&#13;
In the end, with reasonable good will, we managed to get along and work quite constructively.&#13;
&#13;
I had two very specific tasks: the completion of an analytical piece covering the transport&#13;
sector in the form of a chapter of an economic report. This chapter covered transportation&#13;
with all the policy questions, tariffs, intermodal distribution functions, and the role of&#13;
transport industries partly in the private sector. This was complicated by the fact that the army&#13;
was an enterprise engaged in road transports, trucking and particularly in inter-island shipping&#13;
over the 3,000 islands of the country which proved to be difficult--the army being a difficult&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
entrepreneur to integrate into the analysis of the transport sector. Finally, there was, of&#13;
course, the establishment of a rational public sector investment program. I finished the report&#13;
within the year.&#13;
&#13;
We also had another specific task which was to put together a first operation for the World&#13;
Bank, which we did in record time, in about six months. The engineer, [Patrick 0.] Malone,&#13;
resided at headquarters and I was the economist for this project. It was a road maintenance&#13;
project with planning components and some rehabilitation. Malone and I enjoyed a good&#13;
working rapport, with none of the jealousies which existed between the head of the mission&#13;
and regional management. There were no such problems, either, between the loan officers&#13;
and the project team.&#13;
&#13;
Our professional life in Indonesia was as much conditioned by this hazy advisory function as&#13;
it was by the two easily identified elements in my work program, the transportation sector&#13;
report and the project. Looking back today, I don't think that I spent more than forty to fifty&#13;
-'eweur, e:E tire mr.~st, afm' titncs&amp;f chess !knk intcmal orttpatyieces. The reyt""Wa'S'"lTJ.uch&#13;
rbore 'ft.Yse:         -Â·-              Â·Â·    Â·-              .           ...                     -â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
Just to give you a few examples, I would go on the railway between Jakarta and Surabaya&#13;
with BAPPENAS people who probably had never been on a railway before, simply to inspect&#13;
what would be the investment requirements on a railway so dilapidated that at times it could&#13;
travel at no more than 20 kilometers per hour. Even before I got the engineers in, it became&#13;
pretty clear to me that here was outdated eastern European equipment--mainly East German--&#13;
and that the old Dutch infrastructure was completely run down. Bridges were no longer safe;&#13;
there was no automatic traffic control and danger of collisions. I took along the people&#13;
responsible for the railways and made the very first recommendations. One of them was that&#13;
it made no sense to buy Japanese locomotives overnight, which the Japanese had been&#13;
pressing for, but there were operational and infrastructure problems which had to be fixed&#13;
before a modern railway could be put on the track.&#13;
&#13;
I found $60 million dollars worth of unused highway equipment which otherwise we would&#13;
have financed had we not found it in the bush in Sumatra. It had been bought on credit by&#13;
Sukarno and had not been paid for. It was French equipment, but it was there now. The debt&#13;
was established. Nobody had known what the debt was all for, but at least we found the&#13;
graders whom we helped assign to particular maintenance stations. It was very practical&#13;
work. Then we looked at the ports, and in the port of Surabaya, we went out in a little rubber&#13;
dinghy with an engine. We put lead sinkers into the water just to see how much draft there&#13;
still was. Nobody knew, and we found a brand new sunken submarine in the middle of the&#13;
port of Surabaya.&#13;
&#13;
So, it was often not so much a matter of giving advice but of initiating action. You had to&#13;
instigate a technical ministry not to administer but to go out and look at the railway track or to&#13;
look at what was down there in the water in the port. That was a very rewarding thing, and of&#13;
course, the officials liked this a lot.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
              As useful as it was to instigate technical ministries to chase after practical things that had to&#13;
              be done, there developed a certain reliance of these technical ministries on the in-house&#13;
              experts of the World Bank. If there was one negative thing about the resident mission in&#13;
              Indonesia of that time, it was the quasi-governmental function that the World Bank's mission&#13;
              and therefore the World Bank as a whole began to slip into an activist role. There was a&#13;
              distinct blurring of responsibilities of the government and of a foreign advisory institution of&#13;
              which, of course, Indonesia was a member. I began to feel very uncomfortable after about a&#13;
              year. There were also questions of procurement in which that very openly showed itself.&#13;
              When there was a Japanese locomotive or an Italian piece of road equipment with a credit&#13;
              offer on the table and a lot of pressure from individuals to go in this particular direction, you&#13;
      1--:    couldn't always hide as you can when you sit in Washington behind rules and regulations.&#13;
      ":.$&#13;
       .s     The advisor was asked--often not concerning World Bank money--to advise whether, with the&#13;
     '~,      particular financial conditions and technical specifications, they should buy these 200 Toyota&#13;
      ,)      trucks or buy NMI or a French railway coach. There was no way of ducking these things, and&#13;
      i..     the pressure you were subjected to condone corruption was great.&#13;

c:::~ .:: l                                              The close interrelation between the resident&#13;
8:            mission and the government in an advisoryÂ· function meant that the government abdicated&#13;
&lt;             from some of the functions for which it had clear responsibility and, second, that the advisor&#13;
        ~     occupied a position of power, which wasn't easy to deal with in terms of temptations and&#13;
              pressures. It was not only the Asians who were in there. I had the wildest offers from very&#13;
              well respected German manufacturers and French government people.&#13;
&#13;
              KRASKE: Now, in addition to the Bank mission, there were other groups who were also&#13;
              advising the government. In fact, Indonesia at the time was like a honey pot which attracted&#13;
              all these advisory institutions--Harvard, the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Eoundation, UNDP&#13;
              [United Nations Development Program], and the IMF, who were offering their services and&#13;
              trying to get a piece of the action. How did that play out on the ground?&#13;
&#13;
              THAL WITZ: Well, what I observed was that the government became a little captive to its&#13;
              own advisors. The multitude of advisory groups fed the same ministries, with some friction&#13;
              between them. So the government had so many to choose from. The one party that we&#13;
              probably worked closest with was USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development], who&#13;
              had an enormous mission. But the point to emphasize is that none had a position comparable&#13;
              to that of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
              KRASKE: Was that because of Bernie?&#13;
&#13;
              THALWITZ: No, it was by design. Bernie was the man to implement it, but the design had&#13;
              been worked out between McNamara and Suharto. It called for the World Bank to establish a&#13;
              group of advisors resident in BAPPENAS, which was itself as the planning commission in&#13;
              charge of the design for development. BAPPENAS was the designer of economic policy and&#13;
              construction of the public investment program. So the other groups were advisors who could&#13;
              be called in by different ministers, the Central Bank or BAPPENAS, but at the leisure of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                    January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Indonesian agencies. With us the original agreement was that we were going to be here,&#13;
always available, our chairs nine feet away from theirs, so we had an established position&#13;
which was different from everybody else's and which brought greater dangers for going&#13;
native and becoming part of the government than for any of the others. The US AID mission&#13;
was still a representative of the State Department, as well as an annex to the U.S. embassy,&#13;
and nobody would ever think of confusing them with the Indonesian planning commission.&#13;
They had influence and money. But the permanent mission of the Bank in its advisory&#13;
function, being so closely associated with the local administration, was based on the special&#13;
role of the Bank. There was one guy from the IMF who was in a similar situation, but for the&#13;
rest, they were all more removed.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now, you mentioned the tension in the relationship with Washington. Was that&#13;
because Bernie Bell had his direct line to McNamara's office and wasn't paying much&#13;
attention to the program department?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was this before the '72 reorganization?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: We're talking '69.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: You were still relating to the old projects department Was that relationship also&#13;
difficult?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: That was also affected. Tension existed between the program department and&#13;
the vice president, mainly [Raymond J.] Goodman and Cargill, and the head of the mission. I&#13;
must emphasize that Bernie Bell didn't say he wasn't going unless he dealt directly with&#13;
McNamara; I think it was McNamara who thought that he should visibly take responsibility&#13;
for the special effort that the Bank was making in Indonesia. He was thinking of similar&#13;
efforts in Algeria and in some other countries, but only in Indonesia did it come to bear.&#13;
Bernie Bell was the executor of the McNamara design, which had been worked out with the&#13;
Indonesians. He relished it, of course, as he only had to deal with one person, and that was&#13;
the World Bank's president So he made his contribution.&#13;
&#13;
The personalities of the people in Washington and Bernie Bell were not well suited. Bernie&#13;
Bell always arranged to be out of town when either Cargill or Goodman would appear in&#13;
Indonesia, and it became obvious to them that the Indonesian government, which had adopted&#13;
Bernie Bell, would treat them with a minimum of politeness and certainly would not make&#13;
any decisions on the direction of the World Bank's work in Indonesia without Bernie BelL&#13;
None of the actors really did anything to deal with the resulting tension. Everybody either&#13;
enjoyed it too much or felt too hurt by it, so that the readiness for compromise on the part of&#13;
Cargill and Goodman or Bernie Bell and Alfred Matter did nothing to attenuate this basic&#13;
problem.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Did you feel the firm hand of McNamara in your day-to-day life?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Not on a day-to-day basis. McNamara had conversations with Bernie Bell&#13;
pretty often and made sure that at least twice a year he would get the story from the&#13;
Indonesians on how things worked. He didn't get that from his own programs people. Again,&#13;
that was another cause of friction because the programs department was kept in the dark. So&#13;
Bernie had to prepare for the annual meetings' discussions and various other meetings&#13;
between McNamara and the Indonesians. Twice a year McNamara received feedback both&#13;
from Bell and from the Indonesians, and since these two groups had grown together so tightly,&#13;
he always got the same story, and there was never any friction arriving at McNamara's desk&#13;
about any problems between the resident mission and the Indonesians.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Did you feel emanating from McNamara's office any particular directions as to&#13;
what you should do, how you should do it, and what items you should focus on?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. In the beginning it was very obvious that his direction was general; he&#13;
looked at our work in very general terms, but you knew that he was deeply interested. Here&#13;
was a government following a traumatic political transition, having gotten rid of Sukamo, and&#13;
confronting overwhelming economic problems. Poverty was extremely widespread. There&#13;
was enormous tension in the country following the overthrow of Sukarno, and the Chinese&#13;
had been attacked with lots of bloodshed. There was fear of communism. It was essential to&#13;
make this economy efficient, to let the people of that economy feel that efficiency now&#13;
reigned and that there was a chance for growing and joining wealthier nations. That, of&#13;
course, meant sensible policies, good projects, good investments, good administration, plus&#13;
the sympathy McNamara had for the people. He already showed some interest in the&#13;
population problem, which I had not seen in other country contexts.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He didn't focus on the poverty issue?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Before I went out there, I had a one and a half hour talk with him. If I were to&#13;
reconstruct it in today's atmosphere, the poverty theme was non-existent in the Bank. There&#13;
were in our discussions traits that came back four years later. When McNamara would talk&#13;
about life in the villages, there was a concern for excessive population growth and the earning&#13;
capacity of agriculture. He knew oil would become important, better than we knew when we&#13;
went out there. He looked at Indonesia like a businessman, like a business man looks at a&#13;
company which would have revenues. What to do with the revenues? Would they be spread&#13;
it in such a way and so efficiently that wealth would be distributed in a better fashion? All&#13;
these themes now ring bells because we've heard them since 1973. But if I were to&#13;
reconstruct the atmosphere of 1968-69, it is surprising how his concern about income&#13;
distribution and the efficiency of social systems, how all that was already part of his thinking.&#13;
&#13;
You asked one other question which I haven't answered yet, which was about relations with&#13;
the project department at headquarters. There was less friction. I did need the engineer who&#13;
worked for David Knox at headquarters, I needed to get along with him, and we were friends.&#13;
That didn't mean that occasionally the director of the worldwide transportation department&#13;
didn't like very much what we were doing. In fact, he visited me once, arriving on a Sunday,&#13;
and was very angry that the port was not open yet. He blamed me for it. It was the first&#13;
occasion I had of saying to him, "If you really think that we're doing the wrong thing, you will&#13;
&#13;

                      January 11, February 11 and 18, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
have to talk to Mr. McNamara." It was a polite way of telling him that I was working more&#13;
for McNamara than I was working for him .. I was young, so I did it carefully. But still, the&#13;
friction was apparent. In the end, it worked out well because teams had to be formed, and we&#13;
worked closely with headquarters in the power and transportation sectors.&#13;
&#13;
We had three people dealing with agriculture out there, working on their own without much&#13;
friction. But you're right, some friction resulting from the design of the mission and our role&#13;
did affect the sectoral side as well, and I contributed to it.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: In 1970 you came back here and became division chief in the West Africa&#13;
department?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah, on the program side. When I went out to Indonesia, there was one&#13;
person who said don't go: it was the personnel chief of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Reg [R.A.] Clark?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Actually Reg Clark and Konrad Busse. Konrad Busse was more open than&#13;
Reg when he told me that the Bank was introducing some sort of planning for future&#13;
managerial positions. He told me that I had now been in transportation for five or six years&#13;
and that I was part of a core of people to whom the personnel administration wanted to give&#13;
wider exposure in the Bank. The next assignment that might come my way--something that I&#13;
hadn't done yet- might be in the financial complex or on the programs side or maybe in the&#13;
economics department. But before too long, they would just ask that I get out of the projects&#13;
department and do something else in the Bank that would give me a wider basis for future&#13;
work. For this reason, he thought that I shouldn't go to Indonesia as this move was likely to&#13;
happen within the next two years, but if I was in Indonesia, nobody would want to take me.&#13;
As I said earlier, it was easy to say no as a bachelor, so I went off to Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
After about nine months of being in Indonesia, the Bank changed its personnel system and&#13;
introduced grades for the first time, as you may remember, from A to L. What today would be&#13;
a level 25 was then a B. A was approximately the division chief level. AlB was a deputy&#13;
division chief or like a 25 today, a prominent person within the division. Then the question&#13;
came up how to rate people assigned to the resident mission in Indonesia, and the big issue&#13;
became whether we were going to be a B or a C. Some of us out there aspired to an A, the&#13;
equivalent oftoday's level26. Finally there was a decision that we would be given a B, the&#13;
equivalent of today's 25, with a warning that we would have to be prepared to take on a new&#13;
assignment once we returned to headquarters. This is how I got the job of a program division&#13;
chief in West Africa--West Africa because I knew some French. There was practically&#13;
nobody in the Bank who spoke French. A few French, some Belgians and I, had worked in&#13;
this area from the transportation side. I had worked on Cameroon, Chad and Senegal, very&#13;
painfully reading French consultants' reports. I remember in 1966 there was a snowstorm and&#13;
for five days I sat and translated, word for word. It was a distinct effort by the Bank, without&#13;
big fanfare, to identify maybe fifty people or so who, without really pre-planning their career,&#13;
could in some way be exposed to responsibilities other than the ones they had grown up with.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               25&#13;
&#13;
So, I took over this job as Equatorial Africa Program Division Chief. I enjoyed it&#13;
tremendously. In fact, I was quite successful due to one factor, namely, that I was recognized.&#13;
At that time the programs and projects relations were still quite frazzled and there was a lot of&#13;
arrogance on the projects side about these negotiators on the program's side, as the people&#13;
from programs pompously talked about the development prospects of the continent. There&#13;
was a lot of misunderstanding between the two groups. I was lucky in having a boss like&#13;
Chaufoumier, who was a very constructive man with little patience for the petty conflicts&#13;
between programs and projects, notwithstanding the fact that as an economist and a diplomat,&#13;
his heart, in a fight, would have probably been more on the program side. But he did a clever&#13;
thing. He wanted a few projects people to take responsibility on the macro side, the programs&#13;
side, and vice versa. True enough, when I put a country program together for Cameroon,&#13;
which wasn't easy at all, I could pull along the projects people without them feeling that I was&#13;
over-lording them. It started with transportation, which was heavy in the investment&#13;
programs of these countries, then agriculture, telecommunications, and then I introduced the&#13;
very first education projects in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
So it became an amalgamation of program work with some economics--we didn't have very&#13;
good economists--and strategic work, with the individual project investments fitting into this&#13;
strategy, which enabled us to pull along our colleagues in the project department.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: These were pretty quiet countries at the time. Did we try to generate a lot of&#13;
business? Were you very active in that?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: Yes. When I took on this job in 1970, I hadn't been in it for more than maybe&#13;
five days when I looked up one day and there stood McNamara, right in front of me in my&#13;
little cubicle. He said, "Wilfried, I have appointed you with a purpose: you will triple lending&#13;
to Equatorial Africa within three years, hopefully within two. I think that the Bank has done a&#13;
deplorable job in Africa, and I want to change that. All that we have done in Africa so far is&#13;
supporting plantation agriculture and some transportation investment which the old colonial&#13;
powers could have done just as well. I want more, I want broader, I want genuine&#13;
development, and you will triple our lending."&#13;
&#13;
True enough, within three weeks he asked to have country program or strategy papers for the&#13;
major countries within six months. It was the preparation of these country strategy papers&#13;
which really did make me focus because I knew I had to walk into his office and itemize what&#13;
I wanted to do in Congo or in Cameroon and how it would fit into the macro situation, what&#13;
the Fund would be doing, what the French would be doing, and then I had to mobilize my&#13;
colleagues in the projects department, who had their own budget, to endorse this plan and&#13;
promise their collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
It was at that stage that the old projects relations and my reputation for quality work began to&#13;
work. It was an incredibly exciting time. Suddenly there were lots and lots of projects with&#13;
strategic significance competing with each other on across the various regions of the Bank.&#13;
Questions carne up such as: why does Equatorial Africa need five refineries in the public&#13;
sector where one would be good enough? How do you get out of plantation agriculture if&#13;
plantation crops provide the foreign exchange for imports for the rest of the economy? What&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               26&#13;
&#13;
kind of agriculture will you have instead? And in what way can the Bank help? These were&#13;
not questions people had thought of before. There was this whole question, what you could do&#13;
for the development of a country like Gabon, where you had very low literacy but a very&#13;
narrow portion of people aspiring to be Frenchier than the French and going to French&#13;
universities. How do you underpin any kind of development approach with a broader basis of&#13;
training? There were no vocational training institutions; the training in agriculture, and even&#13;
commercial training, was provided by the plantations and the sugar and palm oil factories. So&#13;
it was a matter of designing an approach to having an education system which would be truly&#13;
national, more geared to the composition of an independent country than to an appendix of a&#13;
colonial power. This became the basis of the very first education project in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The architects, of course, took over straight away, worrying for days about the angle of the&#13;
roof in a Chadian education project and overdesigning everything. The Africans had built&#13;
schools where the top one and a half meters of the schools had no wall and you got natural air&#13;
conditioning. Our architects had school buildings with completely closed walls and air&#13;
conditioning behind the house that would break down the second day and not enough&#13;
windows even to get cross-ventilation. So how do you keep yesterday's project colleagues,&#13;
who are not in my sector, from being so overly technical? How do you change their designs?&#13;
In agriculture the big problem was getting word to the smaller farmer and providing him with&#13;
some services. Nobody knew of [Daniel] Benor and his extension system at that time.&#13;
&#13;
There were macro questions, too. For example, I could not in two years of discussions with&#13;
Cameroon get them to understand that a zero interest rate is not good for development&#13;
because it fosters investment without encouraging savings and the mobilization of resources.&#13;
I also had fights over this issue with the French advisors.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: What was the relationship like with the French, who were, of course, always&#13;
pushing the Bank to do more in West Africa? How much of McNamara's insistence that we&#13;
should triple our lending and do more in West Africa was really a response to that pressure?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: In 1970 the French had not yet discovered the Bank as a potential source of&#13;
support for West Africa. They did not push the Bank to become a major instrument of&#13;
financing, nor did they get worried about the particular patterns of development that the Bank&#13;
would impose or recommend. That all came ten years later. It took about ten years for the&#13;
Bank to become big enough in Africa so that it could be an important factor in assuring&#13;
growth and peace in Africa, which was in the French's interest as well as in everybody else's.&#13;
The concentration on the small farmer as opposed to the plantation that farmed commercially,&#13;
with monopolies in processing and international sales and even serving as a taxation agency,&#13;
came ten years later and led to a major clash. The desire to do more in Africa was home-&#13;
grown with McNamara, and it was much more of a worldwide mission objective than it was a&#13;
response to any erstwhile colonial power requesting that the Bank do more in a particular&#13;
area.&#13;
&#13;
Initially, when the French saw what we were trying to do, they were very helpful and very&#13;
collaborative. They hadn't invented it; they hadn't put pressure on McNamara. When we got&#13;
in and pointed out that there was no road to the north of Yaounde yet the real Cameroon lies&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
800 kilometers to the north of the capital, they were in full agreement. Part of our program&#13;
was a road that would, for the first time, make it possible for the cattle economy to be&#13;
somehow linked to the coastal area.&#13;
&#13;
But then the Africans tended to go overboard. I once went to the Central African Republic.&#13;
[Jean-Bedel] Bokassa was still the emperor, and he wanted a railway. We did a feasibility&#13;
study of the proposed railway that would link the Cameroon railway to Bangui, hundreds and&#13;
hundreds of kilometers through the jungle. We quickly came to the conclusion that this would&#13;
be a waste of money. Needless to say, Bokassa was very angry. He locked me up at a&#13;
diplomatic dance and wouldn't let me out until the morning at four o'clock. He told me that&#13;
he was very annoyed with me because he had already printed a stamp with a locomotive on it,&#13;
and how could I destroy this project.&#13;
&#13;
We then also had our first clashes with the French, also in connection with transport&#13;
investments. There was a proposal to build a railway from Yaounde to the interior of Gabon,&#13;
and there were twelve French and two German forestry companies who were interested in&#13;
exporting the tropical wood and needed a railway. Further inland, there was also an iron ore&#13;
deposit.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was all in Gabon?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ:This was Gabon, but you're talking about Gabon and Cameroon and moving&#13;
from the west into central Africa and to northern Nigeria. So these were all international&#13;
connections. There was also the manganese mine in the southeast of Gabon. These are all&#13;
vast countries territorially, and the railway was to cover great distances through difficult&#13;
terrain. I declined the financing ofthis railway, and the pressure I got was just tremendous.&#13;
The first clashes were with the commercial interests in the former metropolitan countries.&#13;
They were trying to use the Bank to load these projects onto the infrastructure budgets of&#13;
these countries. My concern was--and this was where my country program perspective came&#13;
in--that here you have the beginning of a debt crisis. Even in the Bank they didn't know what&#13;
I was talking about. Debt? Africa?&#13;
&#13;
I had the same problem later as project director in Senegal and Mali. There was one and a&#13;
half billion dollars worth of dams but no infrastructure for agriculture. It would have taken&#13;
another two billion dollars for the development of the canals and for planning the fields for&#13;
which there was absolutely no provision. The French, the Germans and the Belgians put&#13;
enormous pressure on the Bank to just finance those dams. And we did not. This required&#13;
incredible stamina. So 1970-'71 was the beginning of us getting really involved in West&#13;
Africa, with quite a lot of good will, and supported by a genuine interest on McNamara's part.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: You left again fairly quickly after only spending a year and a half in West&#13;
Africa? How did this happen? Did you look for a change?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Not at all.&#13;
&#13;

                     January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              28&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Did those people who were trying to put you on the fast track decide that you had&#13;
enough country experience?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: No, it sounds arrogant, but at that time I had become some sort of a hot&#13;
commodity. There is no other way to say it. People on the projects side such as, Baum, Knox&#13;
and [Robert] Sadove thought I was wasted on the programs side. They kept on plugging, and&#13;
while I was still out in Indonesia Knox wanted to give me a division chiefs job in his&#13;
department as the head of an in-house economics division that did not make much sense.&#13;
&#13;
Here I was enjoying myself as a programs division chief, working with a man from whom I&#13;
learned a lot, Chaufoumier, enjoying the politics of Africa and Europe, with the World Bank&#13;
thrown into what was for the Bank a new continent and with a lot of support from McNamara.&#13;
In fact, I envisaged that I would stay there for five years. I couldn't imagine that I would walk&#13;
away from this at all, and I didn't miss the projects department. There was enough access to&#13;
my projects colleagues through the working party system in order to integrate them into the&#13;
programs work, so I didn't miss them.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And you liked working with the Africans?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I loved working with the Africans. Today's frustrations about Africa were&#13;
nowhere present. And there was an elite group of young people in Cameroon and Congo,&#13;
some of them were French educated, very sophisticated, with suits tailored to the hilt. They&#13;
were truly elegant and classy. There were a few who had studied in Moscow and who turned&#13;
out to be the most western. They were not seduced by Moscow at all. In fact, it was--quite&#13;
apart from East Germany--my first brush with that kind of training. As a group they were&#13;
sophisticated, quick, intelligent and warm. They were people with whom you could work&#13;
during the day and go out at night, dance, listen to music, and watch people dance. They&#13;
would have cultural functions with folk dance, singing, music, and with these sophisticated&#13;
project managers, I would go from market to market--much nicer than in East Africa which&#13;
had none of the warmth of communal life that existed in West Africa. Things went wrong&#13;
later, but during these formative years I liked working in Africa. They were also forgiving of&#13;
my funny French. They liked McNamara. They liked the Bank as a whole. They loved&#13;
Chaufoumier, who would have long philosophical discussions with the presidents with whom&#13;
I did not converse until ten years later. Chaufournier would sit with a Secretary a whole night&#13;
and philosophize about the chances of Africa.&#13;
&#13;
One day I got a call saying that the World Bank has decided that you shall now be deputy&#13;
director of transportation. It is good for your career, the department, the future, and&#13;
McNamara knows about it. Chaufournier was strangely supportive of it when I thought he&#13;
would fight it, and he made no attempt to hold me back.&#13;
&#13;
This promotion was the most boring job I ever had. I was in charge of three highway&#13;
divisions which was the more boring part of transportation. They were run by old highway&#13;
engmeers.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Cliff [S. Clifford] Hardy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Cliff Hardy. [George T.] Mahoney was the nicest of them; at least he would&#13;
listen when I talked to him about strategic matters. The more interesting thing was the&#13;
morning meetings where the three deputy directors and the director, David Knox, got together&#13;
and talked a little strategy every day.&#13;
&#13;
Going back to reviewing highway projects in Ecuador, then in India and then in Portugal was&#13;
pretty routine. It was the only time since joining the Bank that I didn't have a front-line job&#13;
and was not associated with something new as I had been in Africa. So I was just creeping&#13;
along, nicely paid, a nice title, but essentially it was a position that, in my view, the Bank&#13;
didn't need.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I suppose it was a matter of quality control and administrative supervision?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: Quality control, budget control, administrative supervision. The recourse&#13;
mechanism during negotiations when the program department did the negotiations and you&#13;
had to bring along the project support. Sometimes there were quarrels, so I had to go in on&#13;
behalf of the director. That was often the most exciting part. Then we began to have country-&#13;
based sectoral strategies, which was a little better. Kim Jaycox and I shared that regardless of&#13;
whether it was railways or highways. He was my counterpart--he had railways and ports; I&#13;
had highways--and there was a third deputy director, Bill [A. F.] Geolot, who took care of&#13;
administration and financial analysis matters. In short, nothing happened in that year; I was&#13;
very sad to have left the Africans and the interface between projects and programs.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was Knox a very inspiring man to work for?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Inspiring is the wrong word. Confidence instilling is the right word. I liked&#13;
the man, without ever totally warming up to him. He was reticent and didn't open up on a&#13;
personal basis, which you can only understand if you ever met Queen Victoria. He still had&#13;
this reserved attitude left over from the colonial system. He grew up in Trinidad. He was a&#13;
very old fashioned person, but entirely trustworthy. Totally and incredibly fair and rigorous&#13;
in analysis. There is just no way that he would commit a simple mistake in logic. And again&#13;
I pumped him like I pumped everybody else. I learned more from him than I did from Warren&#13;
Baum about the rigor of analysis. I was making sure that I would not be caught at the&#13;
decision point having taken any short-cuts. I knew that Knox would find out. And I adopted&#13;
this practice which ever since helped me.&#13;
&#13;
There was one problem during that period where Knox, in fact, turned out to be quite good.&#13;
You must have been personally involved. There was the question of why do we deal with&#13;
India when it refuses international competitive bidding for civil works? This had become a&#13;
bone of contention between the programs and projects department. Knox, who was rather&#13;
accommodating with the Indians without the support of the logic of the argument, was&#13;
prepared to accept their political reasons. But there was Warren Baum, who was very .&#13;
analytically rigorous, and refused to take into account any kind of political considerations. So&#13;
there was an almost unbridgeable gap between those two gentlemen and the two positions. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was the nature of these two men that added to the severity of the problem created by the&#13;
Indians.&#13;
&#13;
In this situation, I was appointed to lead a mission to India and come up with a report on how&#13;
this could be settled. I discussed the internal logic aspect ofthe case which was not totally&#13;
straightforward because the Indians had one good point, which was the fact that international&#13;
competitive bidding was distortional because the prices the Indians set didn't reflect&#13;
international prices--there were too many price distortions to be able simply to use exchange&#13;
rates in the comparison of bids--and I tried to correct this. I went to Knox telling him that I&#13;
was struggling with this problem, and Knox helped a lot in logically clarifying the arguments.&#13;
At the same time, without my asking, he gave me full backing in this jungle of a situation&#13;
between Baum and Cargill. So I was very grateful. This was the one event that happened in&#13;
this one year that is worth mentioning.&#13;
&#13;
I wasn't allowed to talk to either Baum or Cargill, and they were watching each other like&#13;
hawks. I think Cargill had a spy out to make sure that I wouldn't get any advice from Baum,&#13;
who wasn't too worried because he knew I had little contact with Cargill. So I put my&#13;
proposal on a piece of paper, and then there was going to be a meeting in McNamara's office&#13;
to decide whether that should be accepted. I went into the elevator, and there was the&#13;
equivalent of a president's council, except for Peter Cargill. It was by pure accident that we&#13;
were all in the same elevator on the way to McNamara's office. Everybody said, "Thank God.&#13;
Now we have a logical solution to this problem." And the person who was most prominently&#13;
for the proposal was [Siem] Aldewereld, whom I knew very little. It was Aldewereld who said&#13;
that we really have to make sure to get a rational and not a political solution and that we could&#13;
defend in any other country where there is an underlying problem of valuation and pricing.&#13;
Aldewereld was quite emphatic when he assured us, "I will support you to the end."&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Aldewereld had to because, ultimately, the conflict was really with McNamara,&#13;
who wanted to lend large amounts of money to India, and the projects that could carry these&#13;
large amounts were all blocked by this conflict.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Now, I didn't really care nor did I even know about this tension between India&#13;
itself and McNamara wanting to lend a lot. But the point is here was Aldewereld who said&#13;
that this is a rational proposal that should bring the Indians around, too. We went up into&#13;
McNamara's office and McNamara, for the reasons that you just mentioned, said, "Well, this&#13;
proposal is logical, totally consistent, but I think I will not accept it, as it will not carry&#13;
political weight in India." I looked over to Cargill, suspecting him of having brainwashed&#13;
McNamara. Then I turned around, and there was Aldewereld saying, "Bob you're taking the&#13;
words out of my mouth." It was Aldewereld who fell in line instantly, not Cargill who could&#13;
afford to sit back and smile. Aldewereld had obviously read McNamara and knew which side&#13;
of his bread was buttered. So I walked out of this office and my proposal died. That was the&#13;
only real event that happened. Then they redid the study and told Kim Jaycox how it should&#13;
come out. So Kim did the study. He talked to me about it and came up with the proposal to&#13;
provide a local preference, which finally convinced the Indians to accept international&#13;
competitive bidding for civil works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I think it was Ernie Stern who was drafted, eventually, to write this all up and put&#13;
it together. He came up with the idea of splitting the difference--instead of 15% making it&#13;
7.5%. That's how the 7.5% preference came up.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I know. Knapp got into the act, too. He didn't like that proposal at all because&#13;
it was ignoring the local value added. He said we hadn't done this anywhere else, and we also&#13;
didn't know what the degree of price distortions really is. So he neither liked my proposal nor&#13;
the 7.5% preference. But in the end political necessities decided the outcome, and McNamara&#13;
made his position very clear and accepted the compromise precisely for the reasons you&#13;
mentioned. He didn't want to be blocked in India, and he went ahead with it.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I remember your mission and your report. Still, I don't remember your particular&#13;
proposal how to square the circle and how to make things fit. But I remember that you did an&#13;
exhaustive study of the civil works and construction industry in India, what was wrong with it&#13;
and what should be done to put these people on a more efficient track. How long did you&#13;
actually spend in India?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: I spent almost two full months in India, going around from state to state,&#13;
looking into the books of construction companies. It was at that stage, as the result of this&#13;
field work, that I thought while the Indians had a logical point about distortions, they really&#13;
had nothing to fear in the way of international competition. This was the major outcome of&#13;
my recommendation. It was an issue that the Indians did not have to worry about. In spite of&#13;
all the distortions of the capital cost, for example, the knowledge of how to organize a labor&#13;
gangs, without which no foreign contractor could operate and bring to bear his un-distorted or&#13;
even subsidized capital cost of the machinery, effectively ruled out any foreign competition.&#13;
The Indians, I thought, would come out on the average 20% to 25% cheaper without even&#13;
taking into consideration the distortions.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Even ifthere had been a foreign bidder who somehow came close to beating the&#13;
local competitors, the Indians would have found ways and means to block this guy. This was&#13;
all nonsense.&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: This was all a political thing.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, it was two things. On the one hand, they were a people who as a matter of&#13;
principle just rejected the idea that somebody should come in and impose this requirement of&#13;
international competitiveness. On the other hand, there were the politicians who were&#13;
grandstanding and to whom the very notion that there would be foreign leaders coming into&#13;
the country, vying, bidding, and contracting, would get all bent out of shape. So it was&#13;
between these two pressures that the Indian bureaucrats decided that they weren't going to&#13;
accept our rules for international competitive bidding.&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: I learned something through this episode, and I don't know whether one can be&#13;
proud of this lesson. I went into this issue with the logical training and rigor ofthe Baums&#13;
and the Knoxes of this world and I came out of it with the political savvy of the Cargills and&#13;
the Chaufourniers. I'm not sure whether I liked myself for it.&#13;
&#13;

                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Maybe we can go back for a second. Your education and training were as a&#13;
general economist. You came to the Bank having already worked in India essentially as a&#13;
macro economist. Then you came to the Bank and joined the transportation department?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No, I first joined the economic staff.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Oh yeah, you went to work for Irving Friedman, and then you moved to the&#13;
transport department. But you learned about being a transport economist in the Bank. Had&#13;
you any formal training? Did you study transport economics or read any textbooks?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Nothing at all. Textbooks I read.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: But essentially, you just watched what people were doing and how they were&#13;
doing it.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: When I joined the Bank, I was given a choice to work with DeWilde in Africa,&#13;
essentially as a macro-economist on problems of industrialization as a regular staff member as&#13;
distinct to the YP program where I was told that I had a good chance. The reason I chose to&#13;
join the YP program rather than the somewhat better paying regular job for which I was old&#13;
enough and had the experience of two years in India was precisely because I wanted to do&#13;
something that I did not yet know. I was a monetary economist in India. I could have gone to&#13;
the Fund. I wanted to go to the Bank because it was something I knew less about. I opted for&#13;
transportation because, in my mind, the Bank was an institution that was associated with&#13;
investments, that's what it says in its Articles, and I knew nothing about it. So I decided to&#13;
work either in the public utilities division, in transportation or in agriculture and to learn what&#13;
I didn't know. I remember on my first mission to look at a port in Calcutta I just kept asking&#13;
these guys questions until they were blue in the face and ran away from me.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now on the technical side, on the side of pure transport economics, did you have&#13;
any gurus like Warren Baum or others who taught you the intricacies ofthe trade?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Warren Baum was not a transport expert; he was, in fact, a country economist.&#13;
The guru that most influenced me as a trained transport economist was Vince Hogg, who&#13;
studied here in the Northwest, which is one ofthe places where you learn transport&#13;
economics. He was a true transportation economist. He had left the field of general&#13;
economics after six terms at the university and became a specialist. Hans Adler, like me, was&#13;
a more general economist who had learned the trade, and could teach me where to look for&#13;
examples and read about methodologies. There was Sei-young Park, a Korean, who was not&#13;
quite as well versed as Vince Hogg was, but was also pretty specialized. And that was it. The&#13;
rest of the staff in the department were maybe 180 financial analysts and engineers, and we&#13;
were four economists to start out there. But what most attracted me was to learn something&#13;
about activities I had no idea about--I would have done the same thing about power or&#13;
telecommunications--to go into a port and see what investments get made in a port, why they&#13;
are made, or to look at transport between two cities and see if they need a railway there, who&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
would use it and at what cost or would it be cheaper to travel on a truck. This was like a new&#13;
lease on life.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now, the next thing that happened was that there was the '72 reorganization, and&#13;
that affected you, although you stayed more or less where you were.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I think this has to do with your earlier questions: Why did you go away from&#13;
the division chiefs job in programs? Why was this assignment so short? Why back into&#13;
transportation that you had done for five years before? I now suspect that a few people in the&#13;
Bank, Chaufournier among them, had quite intimate discussions with McNamara about what&#13;
was wrong with the Bank before '72. They thought there wasn't enough country focus, that&#13;
what the country departments had in terms of country focus was too thin in terms of the true Â·&#13;
mission ofthe Bank on the investment side. They didn't tell McNamara that they needed&#13;
more power, but suggested that he upgrade the country relations function and equip it with a&#13;
minimum of sectoral knowledge and capacity under a vice president who would not have to&#13;
go begging to the projects staff. The country departments would have to be staffed with&#13;
people who will grow deep enough in understanding Latin America or Africa, who would&#13;
become partners within the same vice presidency, and who would get a closer amalgamation&#13;
of the traditional programs function with some integration of the sectoral approach. I am&#13;
pretty sure that the reason why Chaufournier let me go so easily out of the programs function&#13;
back into the projects department was that I fitted into the post-'72 reorganization scheme&#13;
where he, the programs vice president, needed projects people with whom he could work.&#13;
&#13;
When the 1972 reorganization came and I suddenly got a call--while on vacation in&#13;
Spain--from Burke Knapp, who said, "We have had a reorganization. We ask you to be the&#13;
projects director of the West Africa Region."&#13;
&#13;
I asked him, "What reorganization? What's a projects director and what's a region?"&#13;
&#13;
He told me that I better come back, so I left Barcelona that same night and had my first good&#13;
talk with Chaufournier, the new vice president for that region as his desigated projects&#13;
director. He was pretty clear about what he expected. He didn't want me to be his deputy&#13;
director for projects. He didn't want me to hover over the division chiefs who were true&#13;
experts, people like Roger Rowe who'd been in agriculture and who were old hands. He&#13;
wanted me to keep his projects department together, be strategic, and build a bridge to the&#13;
programs directors responsible for the francophone and anglophone part of West Africa. In&#13;
fact, that's how it worked out.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: You didn't know about the reorganization beforehand?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: I knew nothing.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: But you were aware that there were some problems with the old structure, that&#13;
somehow the Bank had outgrown it, that this tension between the projects and the programs&#13;
side was unwieldy and required constant interventions at too high a level to really work&#13;
efficiently?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I knew that, but I went into 1972 with much confidence that I could make the&#13;
system work, which clouded my eyes against a deeper organizational problem. My confidence&#13;
was based on the fact that I could function on the programs side as a programs division chief&#13;
with experience in projects and that I could go back as deputy director in a projects&#13;
department and work quite nicely with different regional directors such as Jerry Alter in the&#13;
Latin America region. On a personal level, with people around me like the Chaufoumiers, the&#13;
Baums, Jerry Alter, the old system seemed to creak along quite nicely. I should have&#13;
remembered some ofthe problems we had in Indonesia. In contrast it was relatively&#13;
comfortable in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The new thing was that people didn't have to worry about prerogatives too much.&#13;
Chaufoumier was respected without being feared. I didn't have to suffer many of the&#13;
problems you may have had in Asia. Africa at that time was not suffering as much from the&#13;
problems of national identity. But when a program director wanted to make a loan at all&#13;
costs, regardless of whether the financial analysis would give him a rate of return, and decided&#13;
to ignore the projects people who wanted to mess up his nice country program, well, then we&#13;
had a nice little fight. I often had those fights with Xavier de la Renaudiere, not with Peter&#13;
Wright. So what the '72 reorganization did was that it introduced a resolution mechanism at&#13;
the regional level and spared you from having to go to the president on every issue. So that&#13;
was good.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Were you involved in the staffing of your department, or was this all presented to&#13;
you? It must have been a pretty messy affair.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: It was a pretty messy affair, taking apart the central projects department and&#13;
dividing it up among the regions.&#13;
&#13;
There had been a lot of work on assignments before. I did not have full freedom. I remember&#13;
that I had 66 positions but when I arrived 45 of these were pre-ordained. There was nothing I&#13;
could do about it. There were people who spoke French, people who had to have a new&#13;
region. There were good reasons for assigning about 45 out of the 66 to the West Africa&#13;
Region.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was this done by the personnel department?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: This was done by the personnel department. The personnel department had&#13;
also pre-selected the division chiefs which in the projects department turned out to be very&#13;
important decisions. I had a last right of refusal, perhaps on paper, perhaps in reality. But I&#13;
got away nicely. Since I had been both in programs and projects, I knew who had worked&#13;
there and how it was to work with them, so I had no reason to quarrel with the selection. The&#13;
only one with whom I had a little problem was Roger Rowe, who was a little resentful. He&#13;
wanted to be director of a central agriculture department. He didn't like the reorganization&#13;
which he thought was softening the belly of the Bank, and he already was a little grumpy as a&#13;
person. We had our problems; he was very much a plantation agriculturalist. But once he&#13;
recognized the problems of the small farmer, he became very inventive as it showed later&#13;
&#13;

                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
when he was out in Bangladesh. In fact, if you ask me whether the staffing in that department&#13;
was my staffing, the answer is that it was not for the division chiefs, but I accepted it although&#13;
I could have rejected it. The rest of the staff selection I could easily leave to the division&#13;
chiefs to take care of with the exception of one or two persons per division. We started&#13;
working and things moved very quickly.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, of course, the '72 reorganization was far less traumatic than the '87&#13;
reorganization because it took place in an expanding institution, so there were people being&#13;
recruited all the time.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I had vacancies to start with, and important ones. I didn't have enough French&#13;
speakers, and I didn't have enough people with experience in Africa to man a whole projects&#13;
department. Many people that had worked in the central projects departments and who had&#13;
one trip to Africa were put in the Africa region on the strength of that experience. So this was&#13;
not a matter of getting rid of people. In fact, I only know of one case where somebody just&#13;
outright got screwed, that was Bill Geolot, the third deputy director of the transportation&#13;
department, who came to work one morning and his office was gone. That was how he&#13;
learned that he had been axed as part of the reorganization. It was very unfair; he was a&#13;
substantial man and deserved to be treated with consideration.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Maybe we can talk about some of the highlights of your time as projects director&#13;
in West Africa. This was the period when there was pressure to build up lending volumes and&#13;
presumably in a set of countries that were difficult to work in, with institutional weaknesses&#13;
and lack of skilled personnel. There must have been considerable difficulties to build up the&#13;
lending volumes and the numbers of projects in the way McNamara desired. How did that&#13;
affect you, and how did you cope and deal with this interacting with Chaufournier? How did&#13;
he, in turn, contribute to the resolution of these difficulties?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: You remember that we are now talking less than two years after Robert&#13;
McNamara had walked into my office telling me to triple the lending. Although this was the&#13;
third job I was taking on and the third promotion within two and a half years or so, we were&#13;
still in the build-up phase of the program that McNamara had asked me to develop as the&#13;
division chief for equatorial Africa alone. Here I had twenty-three countries to deal with as a&#13;
projects director where I was, in essence, in charge of the preparation and implementation of&#13;
the pipeline. Yet we were still only in the build-up phase.&#13;
&#13;
I must say that Chaufournier did not pursue a simple numerical objective. He was too&#13;
sophisticated for that and had enough courage to tell McNamara that he did not want to try&#13;
certain things in Congo Bra,zzaville or in Sierra Leone. We designed sectoral strategies for&#13;
agriculture, and the division chiefs were very good at this because now they could focus on&#13;
their assigned countries. We designed a big transportation study for the area. We did too little&#13;
on power but a lot on irrigation. We really put our shoulder to the wheel in education which&#13;
then really took off--we did a lot of education projects. So I would say we were not up to&#13;
McNamara's expectations, but we fell short not so dramatically that he would have been really&#13;
worried. But we could defend the shortfalls by saying it made sense for country or for project&#13;
reasons. McNamara checked on us; he would check during the country strategy discussions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and he would often endorse something that if you added it up, didn't make for a quintupling of&#13;
lending. He really took it upon himself to understandwhat was going on in places like Chad&#13;
where he would go, or Gabon or Senegal and, of course, Nigeria.&#13;
&#13;
Our lending certainly expanded. In Nigeria, for example, we had rice production projects&#13;
with a lot of public financing but what today would be considered a private sector activity. Â·&#13;
Here I must say we did a lot less than was done in Tanzania, where I think the Bank went&#13;
overboard, overrating the creditworthiness, the prospective creditworthiness, and the capacity&#13;
of the state to run the economy in a quasi-socialist setting. Chaufournier and I were much less&#13;
sanguine about quantity alone. We followed a much more differentiated approach paying&#13;
close attention to creditworthiness and inter-country relations.&#13;
&#13;
I saw real difficulties at one stage with the Ivory Coast where we lent very heavily, continuing&#13;
with plantation lending. I went there several times, and then in the Loan Committee, in front&#13;
of Chaufournier, I warned against this kind of lending. I mentioned that what worried me&#13;
about the Ivory Coast was the gradual build-up of an overall debt and an erosion of .&#13;
creditworthiness. Now this was not supposed to be my concern as a projects guy, but I felt&#13;
strongly about it. Here the Ivorians were spending two billion dollars on six sugar plants. I'd&#13;
seen those sugar plants in Ghana from the projects side, and I didn't think they were going to&#13;
make money nor would they contribute to the repayment on schedule of the debt that the&#13;
Ivory Coast was now incurring. Second, I said, there was a problem with the degree of&#13;
independence of the national administration. Every minister still had two guys with their&#13;
attache cases coming out of France. Where the Ghanaians fell flat on their faces making all&#13;
the mistakes in the world, they did have the opportunity of learning their lessons twenty years&#13;
ahead of the Ivorians, and they would eventually turn the situation around. And that's exactly&#13;
what happened. It was much more difficult for the Ivorians to make decisions for themselves&#13;
and build up their own country.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I guess it was also partly due to the rule of Houphouet Boigny and the&#13;
relationship that he had with France.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah, but we had a very different relationship with him than the one we had&#13;
with the Presidents of Tanzania or Uganda. We were not in his hands, and he was not in ours.&#13;
It was a difficult relationship. Chaufournier often sent me rather than his program directors&#13;
off to negotiate the difficult things. Because my French was bad, I could be a little grumpy but&#13;
I could laugh, and if things did not work out I could be dismissed afterwards as the projects&#13;
director. I became a negotiator on such critical matters as on sugar in the Ivory Coast.&#13;
Chaufournier knew exactly what he was doing. He never sacrificed me in the process. He&#13;
would call me back when it was too difficult. He would even travel with me sometimes. In&#13;
Senegal, when the question of financing the dams came up and I just would not go along with&#13;
the proposal, he did stand by me in the end.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: To go back to the question, you never had the feeling that you were under&#13;
unbearable pressures to move with projects that you weren't completely confident about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. Not a single time. When it came down to supporting a sugar project in&#13;
Ivory Coast in response to the pressure of lending as this was your quickest chance of&#13;
building up your total lending, I felt totally comfortable in saying this was a lousy project. I&#13;
felt comfortable that I had a vice president who would let me say this in miserable French and&#13;
that he would be with me whatever the results were. How he dealt with the powers within the&#13;
Bank and how he dealt personally with McNamara, I'm not quite sure. But mind you, we&#13;
found enough good things to do without any pressure, and that's the other side of the coin,&#13;
things that we were enthusiastic about, so that our lending actually did go up. It went up quite&#13;
a lot, perhaps not as much as McNamara set as a target, but it did go up. We really did some&#13;
useful things: when we introduced education lending which was really important in that area,&#13;
when we went out of plantation agriculture and had small farmers projects such as the rice&#13;
projects, and when in infrastructure we appraised projects very carefully and rejected projects&#13;
that didn't make any sense, such as the Pan-African railways.&#13;
&#13;

                                    Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Welcome back, Wilfried. Last time we talked about your assignment in West&#13;
Africa as Director of the Projects Department. Could you talk a little about Chaufournier and&#13;
how he was to work with? He was at the time your Vice President and someone who, as you&#13;
described last time, had chosen you to deal with the region's projects problems. What kind of&#13;
a person was he? How was he to work with? And how effective was he in dealing with West&#13;
Africa, a very difficult region, and inside the Bank fending for the interests of his region?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Roger Chaufournier was a very old-fashioned gentleman, kind, complex, with&#13;
a lot of consideration for other people. He was able to put himself into the shoes of his&#13;
negotiating partner or even his subordinates. He had a lot of influence in West Africa because&#13;
he was open to the cultural aspiration of Africans. They sensed this even if he didn't use a lot&#13;
of words. He could spend an entire day with a man like [Ahmed] Sekou Toure and get along&#13;
famously, even if he didn't agree with everything that these people pursued.&#13;
&#13;
He also had his drawbacks. One was that he refused to be analytically totally rigorous. Not&#13;
that he couldn't do his analysis as an economist. I think that in Latin America he had been&#13;
much more of a rigorous economic analyst than he permitted himself to be in West Africa.&#13;
He was very suspicious of the Bank's notion that things could be quantified, that objectives&#13;
could be determined with precision. That made him lose some influence inside the Bank. His&#13;
approach worked alright with Burke Knapp, but later, when Emie[Emest] Stem became the&#13;
Senior Vice President, there was some tension and some disparaging remarks by Ernie about&#13;
his being too loose. I don't think he was loose because he could not be tough, it was more of&#13;
a style that he himself had adopted. He thought it was better for country relations. That made&#13;
him difficult to handle for the people who kept insisting on a firm answer. I remember when I&#13;
was Project Director, he would sometimes have difficulties with people like Louis Pouliquen,&#13;
who insisted, like a terrier, on a provable and demonstrable solution to an issue and who&#13;
would turn down a request on the strength of their analysis when Chaufournier would have&#13;
liked a positive answer for political reasons. The other assistant director, Roger Rowe,&#13;
likewise was very rigorous on the technical side. So there were some difficulties, and I think&#13;
there was tension, stronger than in any other parts of the Bank. He definitely was more of a&#13;
human and political Vice-President and quite unlike [RobertS.] McNamara, who liked to&#13;
quantify things and have provable results. Even under my leadership in the Projects&#13;
Department, you had people who weren't so easily given to taking a political situation into&#13;
account or consider infant industry arguments. So I think Chaufoumier lost out a little in the&#13;
the Bank, especially after Burke Knapp's departure. Burke Knapp had more of an antenna for&#13;
that kind of development diplomacy than Stem later had as Senior Vice-President.&#13;
&#13;
This led to some tension between us as well, and when I told him that I wanted to take a&#13;
sabbatical, not to pursue a particular piece of research but to get a cultural recharging of&#13;
batteries, to see what people in my own countries were thinking, how they were looking at&#13;
development issues, he took it up very gladly. He seemed happy that the person on his team&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
who was clearly the most rigorous, and that was me, was going away for a while. When I&#13;
came back eleven months later, he tried to pull me over onto the programs side which I had&#13;
done before as a Division Chief with him, just out of fear that the rigorous control over the&#13;
Projects Department might take over again when I came back. I fought it and Burke Knapp&#13;
agreed with me. So I went back into the Projects Department and we got along beautifully&#13;
afterwards. Perhaps something had happened to me. I was getting perhaps a little more&#13;
political myself without giving up on a minimum of rigorous analysis. But when I came back&#13;
from the sabbatical in 1977, Chaufournier welcomed me back into his Projects Department&#13;
and we had a very close relationship.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Had there been any particular incidents that demonstrated this tension between&#13;
Chaufournier and those people who wanted to have more specificity?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Mainly very large public sector investment programs which governments&#13;
wanted us to support.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Which Chaufournier tried to promote?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: He was too much of a banker and an institutional person to simply say, "Look&#13;
forget your analysis," but you could sense that he was unhappy to be outright negative and&#13;
looking for a compromise.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was the Gabon Railway an example?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: The Gabon Railway was one of them. Then there was an enormous investment&#13;
of $1.4 billion for two very small countries, Senegal and Mali, to build two dams with&#13;
obviously no cash set aside for any agricultural development down the line. The dams were&#13;
being built as a matter of prestige. The Europeans, the French, and under some pressure&#13;
Chancellor [Helmut H.W.] Schmidt on the German side financed these dams just like they&#13;
financed the Gabon Railway. I remained tough on this one, and I'm glad I did. Obviously, it&#13;
led to total over-indebtedness of these countries, even with the very concessional terms&#13;
granted by the Europeans.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, Chaufournier nudged us into things which were not usual in the Bank at&#13;
the time. For example, he encouraged us to support health investments, and I went along with&#13;
flying colors. It was Chaufournier's idea that we were getting into too much trouble with&#13;
these huge investment projects and that some of the elements that were more directly&#13;
necessary for the people required our attention. I remember the first Mali health project or our&#13;
looking at institutions of higher learning and at the capacity building aspects of human&#13;
resource development, long before the word was invented. These were the new fields into&#13;
which he guided a Projects Department that was much more traditional.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: How close was he to the French establishment? As we know, dealing with West&#13;
Africa has always required particular interaction with the French.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I think it was the perfect mix of distance and closeness. He was in nobody's&#13;
pocket. He was not an insider in that he had lived in the United States long enough, he was&#13;
married to an American woman, he was not part of the finance administration crowd. On the&#13;
other hand, he was recognized in France as an authority on an area in which France had&#13;
particular interests, he understood the political context, so that he could comfortably operate&#13;
and pursue the Bank's objectives effectively. So he was truly a world banker with&#13;
understanding for the French position and the French attitude towards the Bank. He was thus&#13;
an effective link, who was highly regarded by the French and by the Africans.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was his relationship with the African leaders one that he had created entirely&#13;
himself?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Totally. He came over from another region, looked at the story, started&#13;
traveling, and opened his heart to them. He was not just representing the European or the&#13;
French line but was entirely guided by the question how the Bank could help these countries.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Can we talk briefly about the onchocerciasis program? Were you directly&#13;
involved in it?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes. We had a separate outfit that was run by various people. There was&#13;
Mark Bazin from Haiti who ran it for a long while. The Bank's involvement also had a lot to&#13;
do with Chaufournier's interest in non-traditional areas, and river blindness was, of course,&#13;
principally a health issue. There were connections with other agencies such as the WHO&#13;
[World Health Organization] who were keenly interested; as a matter of fact, there was a large&#13;
group of donors who needed to be nursed and satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
There was from the beginning the issue of how to devolve responsibility for the program to&#13;
the Africans. This was very difficult for financial reasons, but I think that responsibility&#13;
stayed with the Bank too long. We weren't hard enough on the devolution issue. This was&#13;
aggravated by a technical issue. The black fly was thought initially to have an incidence&#13;
radius of 100 kilometers and coverage of the program was therefore designed for the&#13;
eradication of that fly within the area of its incidence plus 100 kilometers. Later, scientists&#13;
recognized that the fly could in fact buzz around 500 kilometers, which extended the area,&#13;
brought in new members, and made it more difficult to deal with the issue of devolution early&#13;
enough. The program was getting bigger and was being run by international institutions. So&#13;
this technical shift and the prolongation of it for fifteen years beyond the original design&#13;
period is what led to what I think was an excessive responsibility by one international&#13;
institution over a long period of time. It's like what we discussed on Indonesia--the Bank was&#13;
beginning to be the government. In spite of all the nice movies that we made, there was this&#13;
underlying question that was always in my mind, "When does this become an African affair?"&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Would you think that the success of the program suffered as a result? Do you&#13;
think that the final resolution of the problem, which nowadays has been achieved, might have&#13;
been achieved earlier if there had been greater involvement by the Africans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No, my argument does not affect the initial objective. It's like building a road&#13;
from A to Bora steel factory. Sure you can bring in experts and money from all over the&#13;
world and then you have a road or a steel factory. What you don't have is local capacity for&#13;
maintenance and for addressing other problems. The same occurred with the onchocerciasis&#13;
program: we were successful in eradicating the black fly but we did not establish the&#13;
infrastructure that would prevent a recurrence of the problem.&#13;
&#13;
There was also the issue that onchocerciasis is a very debilitating sickness, but the treatment&#13;
competed for scarce resources and attention needed for other similarly difficult sicknesses,&#13;
such as bilharzia, for example, or sleeping sickness. So while there was success and solutions&#13;
were found, that was not the most important criteria for me. I was concerned how to integrate&#13;
this program sensibly into the overall effort of the African countries and how to get them to&#13;
set their own priorities.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: But isn't that also a bit of hind-sight wisdom? This reflects very much the view&#13;
that we take today, that people have to be involved in the solutions.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Sure. Quite frankly, I wasn't important enough at the time. Still, I think, had I&#13;
been Vice-President, I think I would have been tougher in addressing this issue.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The other aspect, of course, was that the onchocerciasis program was an effort&#13;
that fitted particularly well the can-do attitude of McNamara, who was then running the Bank&#13;
and was getting personally very much involved.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: It fitted both his can-do attitude. Is there a problem? Once you've identified&#13;
it, there must be a technical, economic and financial solution to it. It also fitted his often&#13;
under-represented human kindness instincts. That still doesn't take away from the fact that it&#13;
was an important thing to deal with. I don't think McNamara had to push the region. He&#13;
didn't invent it. It was just that a door was open, he recognized it as something that would be&#13;
up his alley, but it wasn't something that was imposed or invented by him. He just went&#13;
along with it and took a personal interest.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was this already an on-going effort when he visited the region and first saw the&#13;
effects of this disease?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: It was very small effort and he stepped it up. But again, if there was some&#13;
stepping up to do, it was also done by Chaufournier, the WHO, Mark Bazin and Peter Wright.&#13;
So this is not something where a gung-ho President dragged along a reluctant region, it just&#13;
happened to fit his agenda.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Wilfried, since we've referred to McNamara several times, do you want to&#13;
comment on him at this point? What was he like to work for? Did you have direct dealings&#13;
with him? How did this work? Do you have any particular anecdotes or stories you can&#13;
remember?&#13;
&#13;

                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I was never very close to McNamara. As you mentioned in your own book,&#13;
he liked to deal with a relatively small group, and I think I was twice removed from that&#13;
group. It was a very tight group: senior vice presidents, people that he worked with in&#13;
relation to the budget, and the next in rank were the vice presidents. As project director, I was&#13;
relatively far removed. It was only when I was acting for Chaufournier that I got into closer&#13;
contact with him. On some of these occasions, we met with some African presidents together.&#13;
&#13;
But my contacts with him go further back than my time as project director. I think we talked&#13;
about it when I met him as program division chief. I was quite impressed with him. I was&#13;
impressed by the clarity of his views and instructions; there was nothing woozy about the&#13;
man. I was impressed with his engagement. He looked like what I later learned to call an&#13;
eastern brahmin, and he had a clear sense of putting his own life behind the mandate that he&#13;
felt so deeply about. I was a little worried, like many others, about his degree of flexibility,&#13;
and I sensed that Chaufournier was uncomfortable with the straightjacket he felt McNamara&#13;
was trying to put him into. I think Chaufoumier was one of those who moved along with the&#13;
reorganization of 1972 as a real shaker.&#13;
&#13;
This goes back to the issue we discussed earlier. I think Chaufoumier, and people like him,&#13;
thought there was a bit of an unholy alliance between the rigorous analysts, of which I was&#13;
one, and their President, McNamara. On some occasions, I did profit from the existence of&#13;
McNamara when he would come out on my side. This happened when I was in Indonesia and&#13;
also when I was fighting some of these large investments in Africa. I often criticized the&#13;
extravagant costs, on average $200-400 million, of the meetings of the OAU [Organization of&#13;
African Unity], and each time I got an instant and positive response from him. I wasn't the&#13;
one who was suffering in my particular function as project director from what the more&#13;
politically inclined person would have understood to be an unholy alliance between the&#13;
excessively rigorous people at the top and those in the sectoral units of the Bank. But I began&#13;
to understand Chaufournier's worries and, towards the end of his tenure, I was much more&#13;
supportive of Chaufoumier and he of me. If I have to be honest and take on balance what&#13;
irked me and what I liked: he was one of the better Presidents of the Bank.         Â·&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: You didn't suffer much from this targetry, from the fact that you were under&#13;
some pressure to deliver a certain lending program and that quality might have to take a&#13;
backseat?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes. This was often difficult. In a way, I didn't associate that so directly with&#13;
McNamara, although I knew he had come into my office five years earlier telling me to triple&#13;
the lending within three years. So I had a sense of the targetry in all of this. But we were&#13;
working in newly independent countries. We had a feeling that wherever you look, there is&#13;
something to do for the Bank. To me, the idea of expanding lending and to push the capacity&#13;
of countries governing themselves was not a strange one. In fact, I felt the targetry more in&#13;
India than in Africa because I sometimes had the feeling that the Indians could look after&#13;
themselves much better than the Africans could. And, if there was any targetry, perhaps it&#13;
was a good thing to have targetry for Africa. So again, I didn't suffer from it beyond&#13;
occasionally having to say that this $200 million investment for joint financing of a $1 billion&#13;
investment made no sense--unaffected by the targetry.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But then I had more problems with our politicians than I had with McNamara to whom I&#13;
could say, "This is not a good investment, let's stay out of it." And he would look at the&#13;
numbers. There were always some people who would rather not let me display all the&#13;
numbers, but once they were on the table, concern about the lending targets did not override&#13;
that analysis. When I said, "This is a bad project," it died. There was no pressure from the top&#13;
to make it stay alive simply because we wanted to lend that much. We still made enough&#13;
mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Before we leave Africa, can you comment briefly on one question. As you know,&#13;
in the early 1980's, people started to focus on the economic and financial policy problems in&#13;
Africa. We had the [Elliot] Berg Report and other reports which described in great detail the&#13;
mistakes that had been made in terms of economic policies by the African governments. Did&#13;
you at any point during the 1970's when you were involved as project director in Africa, and&#13;
before as division chief on the program side, sense that this was a major problem and an area&#13;
where the Bank needed to intervene but didn't?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yes. Very clearly. That was part ofthe reason which sometimes got me into&#13;
trouble. I cannot claim that I foresaw the need to deal with these problems through structural&#13;
adjustment lending in support of policy reform, as it later emerged. Nor did I foresee that the&#13;
whole paradigm would change and emphasis would become export-led growth, reduction of&#13;
the role of the states, in a way a very liberal concept, which was not the way African leaders&#13;
approached economic development in the seventies, nor for that matter Indian or Latin&#13;
American leaders. The mixed economy, the strong role of the state, the subsidies, all of these&#13;
were generally accepted as the chosen approach to planning.&#13;
&#13;
Where we came across the need to look at the policy element was, first, the question of&#13;
external indebtedness which had something to do with the huge public sector investment&#13;
programs and, second, indirectly, the role of the state. I remember when I looked at&#13;
Cameroon, which was beginning to be an oil country, I recognized that the deficits of the&#13;
public sector enterprises were approaching the net value of the oil export. So there was a&#13;
question that I wanted to pursue about the relative role of the public sector and the alternatives&#13;
to this in the structure of production of a new country. The situation was much worse than in&#13;
India, for example, where you always had a much maligned but pretty vigorous private sector.&#13;
This was not the case in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The overwhelming role of the public sector led us to think about the credit-worthiness and&#13;
indebtedness problem. The question of emphasis on exports in turn led us to think about what&#13;
determined the terms of trade of the productive sectors in the economy. When we looked in&#13;
the mid 70's at places like the Ivory Coast or Ghana, we recognized that here was a plantation&#13;
agriculture, the revenue of which was used to build up the very same industrial public sector&#13;
enterprises that then became the source of a growing deficit. You started out by looking at the&#13;
terms of trade and you recognized that the wrong kind of sector and macro-economic policies&#13;
were being followed and that there was need for policy change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               44&#13;
&#13;
Another element was monetary policy, in particular the link of the francophone countries with&#13;
France. It was believed that low interest rates were good for development, no matter what.&#13;
The savings or allocation aspect of interest rates was totally ignored. We talked earlier about&#13;
the defective composition of public sector investment programs. We began to recognize that&#13;
there were white elephants pushed by the suppliers and the planners. There was, in other&#13;
words, an agenda which began to go much beyond the individual project, but we didn't have&#13;
the machinery nor the will to address these issues.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I suppose we didn't have the sense that we had a mandate to pursue these issues&#13;
so we recognized the problem but decided to stay away and avoid the matter as much as we&#13;
could by selecting projects that were not affected by the malaise.&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: It was a lot more complicated than that, because the Bank was not a&#13;
monolithic organization. If you talk to a guy like [Xavier] de la Renaudiere, for example,&#13;
who was away, he was a very sagacious man, not excessively complex, but certainly not&#13;
unaware of trends and problems. I could talk to him as well as to Chaufournier about these&#13;
problems. I saw this happen in other regions, with Jerry Alter, with whom I also sometimes&#13;
had these private talks.&#13;
&#13;
The new paradigm which began to emerge simply by recognizing that there was a growing&#13;
number of problems that went beyond the individual project raised very contradictory&#13;
reactions by people in the Bank. One group would argue that this had to be outside of the&#13;
mandate of the Bank as the Bank was an investment institution. And if you are talking about&#13;
the overall investment program, the role of the public sector enterprises or the terms of trade&#13;
of agriculture versus industry, you were entering a territory which was so political that the&#13;
Bank would lose its credibility as a financial institution guided strictly by technical concerns.&#13;
&#13;
Soon, however, we were discussing what would be more relevant instruments, and rather than&#13;
losing influence, it was a matter of gaining influence. Program lending as a carrot to entice&#13;
reform was, of course, invented before structural adjustment lending was developed, but now&#13;
gradually it became attractive for the more politically minded of the Bank managers. And&#13;
before we actually did some of the true structural adjustment loans in East Africa, there was a&#13;
fertile field for this kind of lending.&#13;
&#13;
The debate had gone on for five years, since 1975. There was more openness among the&#13;
politicians in the Bank to explore the carrot side, even at the risk of some clashes, because you&#13;
had an instrument in program lending that perhaps gave you more influence than buying&#13;
seedlings as part of a forestry project.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now let's talk about your sabbatical. You left the Bank because you felt you had&#13;
to recharge your batteries and reconnect with what was happening in Germany. What did you&#13;
do, and how did this relate to the Bank and to your later career in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Well, ifllook back, the sabbatical hasn't really produced any noticeable&#13;
changes, but without it I probably would have remained a lot narrower than I turned out to be.&#13;
I'm not sure whether I would have had the political antenna to be a Vice President or to look&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
after the Bank's policy and planning work Wider [Barber B.] Conable. In the rnid-'70's, I was&#13;
a director, still relatively yollilg. My options were to go back to Germany, work there forever&#13;
like some of my colleagues had done at that time, or recharge my batteries there and look&#13;
around but still committing myself to corning back for a minimum of three years.&#13;
&#13;
I took with me some of the McNamara ideas and began to test them and gauge the receptivity&#13;
of the society and the research institutions in Germany. I went to the development institute in&#13;
Berlin: this was 1975-76. The McNamara poverty speech, I believe, was in '73. I was ready&#13;
to make a little bit of a propaganda, to take my knowledge, for example, of northern Nigeria,&#13;
Ghana and Senegal, and see how researchers in Germany, who were making prescriptions for&#13;
the German BMZ [BWidesrninisteriurn fur wirtschaftliche Zusamrnenarbeit Wid Entwicklung],&#13;
would react. I was overwhelmed with the way they had accepted the McNamara line "hook,&#13;
line and sinker." There must have been some 500 Ph.D. theses that were being 'Written in the&#13;
institute in which I worked, and I became a soWiding board for their ideas and something like&#13;
a prophet to them. I became rather careful about it in the end, realizing that these guys had&#13;
swallowed all of these new ideas. I began to suggest that one should wonder how replicable&#13;
these ideas were, they needed to be related to the macro situation, how was one to deal with&#13;
the change in the terms of trade which I had observed in Ghana or in the Ivory Coast. But&#13;
there were people left and right pursuing McNamara's ideas. I expected resistance and&#13;
questioning and was very surprised by this reception.&#13;
&#13;
Now, mind you, this is a period during which the emerging neo-classical model was being&#13;
attacked by the ultra-left in Holland, Germany and Scandinavia. They had a lot of debates&#13;
about the appropriate approach to development in Europe. Various universities in Hamburg&#13;
and in Berlin were moving away from the quiet debate that we had in the research institute.&#13;
In fact, the first question I got when I carne back was from Burke Knapp, who invited me for&#13;
lunch and wanted to know what I had done, what the mood was, and whether the position&#13;
taken by the Bank had put it in some political danger, given the ferocity of the ultra-left attack&#13;
on the Bank. During the eleven months that I was there, the balance was very much in favor&#13;
of the Bank, and those who were writing against the Bank were in such a minority that I&#13;
totally ignored it.&#13;
&#13;
There was some similarity of arguments that I found in Holland, Scandinavia, and particularly&#13;
in Germany at the time. I had these debates but the ultra-radicals seemed to talk nonsense to&#13;
me. Perhaps we were a little short-sighted not to respond to this very early criticism and, in&#13;
fact, wait fifteen years Wltil we got to it when the environmental issues had given greater&#13;
prominence to the Bank's critics. My exposure to these discussions made me much more&#13;
open politically; I was much less of a technician there and I think that opened my mind. To&#13;
worry about the analysis of a railway project was a new experience to me during that&#13;
sabbatical, and I don't think I would have ever integrated all the social and political concerns&#13;
in my analysis had I not had the sabbatical. So, in fact, it was a positive experience.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: At the end of the year, you were ready to come back. Had you given up the idea&#13;
of staying there?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
THALWITZ: Well, this was a commitment that I had to make before I left. I had a very&#13;
personal discussion with Burke Knapp, who didn't want me to go, and I had to promise him&#13;
that I would stay in the Bank for three years after my return. I never thought of questioning&#13;
that commitment. It opened up a little more the idea of going back later to Germany, which I&#13;
had never buried completely, but it's unfortunate that I didn't act on it. Whenever the issue&#13;
came up again, after I had completed my three years, someone would offer me an interesting&#13;
job in the Bank, so I stayed.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: In 1980, you shifted to South Asia which was an area somewhat familiar to you&#13;
but it was something very different from what you had been doing up to that point in the&#13;
Bank. How did this come about? Who made that decision? Did you ask for this transfer?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. The transfer, I think, was a question of when I would be vice president.&#13;
By that time, in 1980, you couldn't become vice president unless Mr. Stem endorsed you, and&#13;
he only knew me from some very tough discussions on the dams issue and whenever we had&#13;
very tough Loan Committee meetings. I was acting vice president for five months in '79 or&#13;
'80--1 think it was still in '80--after Chaufournier moved to EMENA [Europe, Middle East&#13;
and North Africa Region], and no decision was made as to who would be the vice president,&#13;
so I became acting vice president for quite a while. The decision had already been made that&#13;
David Knox would take over as vice president. Ernie told me at this stage that David Knox&#13;
would do well; the way he put it was that he was ahead of me, and I had no difficulty&#13;
accepting that. I was a little sad, but I knew much more about Africa than anybody else by&#13;
that time, except perhaps de la Renaudiere, who had his own line. So David Knox came in,&#13;
and the top managers of the Bank thought that it didn't make much sense to leave the most&#13;
knowledgeable person on Africa--where I had worked for ten years--under a new vice&#13;
president.&#13;
&#13;
I got moved out to an area that had a strange management team. David Hopper was the vice&#13;
president. I became the successor to [Robert] Picciotto as project director. The idea behind it&#13;
was that switching to another region may round out the experience that you've had before&#13;
taking the job of a vice president. So I went over there quite gladly because I had lived in&#13;
India, Nepal; I knew Sri Lanka and Pakistan a little. I also had worked for some five years on&#13;
the transportation side in India. Although I was no longer familiar with the projects, I knew&#13;
the mentality of the clients, and I think I began enjoying it right away.&#13;
&#13;
It was a strange management team. There was Hopper, who had his good sides. He was like&#13;
an encyclopedia, thoroughly knowledgeable about physical and scientific matters, had&#13;
connections all over the place, but was not a manager. That gave me a lot of freedom. The&#13;
team was a little skewed at the director level. Mike [Michael H.] Wiehen was the program&#13;
director, and he was perhaps a little excessively modest. Hopper probably knew that I&#13;
wouldn't stay there forever, so he gave me a lot of rope, which I used. I then had to establish&#13;
my relations with Ann Hamilton, which was not easy. During her discussions I would just&#13;
walk in and talk about the sectors, the projects, and the priorities. I think it disturbed the&#13;
program department a little that there was, for the first time, a project director who, unlike&#13;
Picciotto, was really an expert in the field, who began to have some claim on program lending&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
and even macro questions that the vice president had no trouble leaving to us to sort out. In&#13;
the end, it worked out very nicely and we all became very friendly with each other.&#13;
&#13;
I tried to achieve certain things in our India program which the program department tried to&#13;
block me from doing. Jean-David Roulet was the Resident Representative in Delhi at the&#13;
time. I remember going there and seeing the same problem of the terms of trade, a lot of&#13;
subsidization in agriculture and yet a transfer of resources away from agriculture into an&#13;
inefficient industry, and the pervasive corruption stimulated by the system of extensive&#13;
controls. I just went in there, almost naively, and had my first meeting with a Permanent&#13;
Secretary of Commerce and then with a Minister. I began very philosophically by saying that&#13;
it doesn't really make all that much difierence whether the Bank really has a follow-up&#13;
investment on fertilizer or an SEB [State Electricity Board] project for power. If you could&#13;
really calculate the damage done by maintaining this set of policies, the change of which&#13;
could give you a much better rate of return than any individual investment. I totally failed. I&#13;
was probably ten years too early in bringing this up. I remember Roulet, who was with me in&#13;
the meeting but had not quite dared to warn me, must have thought how naive this guy was in&#13;
trying to change the Indians. Then Ernie went off to Pakistan in 1982 where he was treated&#13;
like royalty--by that time he had recognized that India wasn't ready for structural adjustment&#13;
in spite of my naive ways of trying to change it. His visit to Pakistan was very brief; he went&#13;
for three or four days, left some prescriptions behind, simply called Hopper and told him,&#13;
"Send a team out there and get a policy reform package agreed."&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was when Mahbub ul Haq was Finance Minister?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Mahbub was Finance Minister then. So a little bit by accident, since I had&#13;
planned to go there anyway, we sat together, Mike Wiehen, Hopper and I, and worked out&#13;
what to do in Pakistan. I didn't select myself to go nor did Hopper make the decision, but&#13;
somehow I was the guy to go. So I expanded my visit into a program lending mission, and we&#13;
came to the conclusion that since a full-blown structural adjustment operation really wasn't&#13;
possible there, we would pursue the policy through sectoral adjustment loans, and we tried to&#13;
pick two or three sectors. We had a seminar-type of discussion with the Pakistanis--those&#13;
who would listen. There was much less resistance against the idea of reform than there was in&#13;
India. On the other hand, there was much less capacity to develop a relevant program beyond&#13;
the very thin layer of top experts.&#13;
&#13;
But the idea of promoting any kind of reform in India was in 1982 totally out of the question.&#13;
I began to recognize that the South Asia region was going to be much more conservative than&#13;
the Indonesians, who were determined to avoid the "Dutch Disease," and the Africans, who&#13;
were already running into enormous external debt and inefficiency problems. I had come to&#13;
the conclusion that in India, Sri Lanka or Bangladesh, one had to push hard with a lot of&#13;
courage.&#13;
&#13;
We didn't even come to any real breakthroughs when we were making project loans to India.&#13;
I remember the umpteenth ICICI project, which really was quite bare of any conditionality.&#13;
The battle over power rates with the State Electricity Boards (SEBs), the organization of the&#13;
power sector, and the lack of competition between generators, transmitters and distributors of&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 48&#13;

&#13;
electricity was all very frustrating. The agriculture sector was riddled with subsidies. We had&#13;
the biggest battles over the question of what happens if India performs well enough in one&#13;
sector to absorb its IDA allocation, but fails to perform in five other sectors, would they still&#13;
be entitled to get their entire allocation? The political argument was to make sure that they get&#13;
their allocation. But there were some, I among them, who would question the wisdom of that&#13;
argument. Hopper would always waver.&#13;
&#13;
Occasionally we would get tough. No more agriculture lending unless things change or no&#13;
more SEB projects unless power tariffs go up. Many of these issues went up to Ernie Stem to&#13;
decide and he also wavered. There was no breakthrough with India, and I was getting worried&#13;
looking at the turnaround of Indonesia and Mexico. There was the first inkling of Brazil&#13;
growing, as it did much more to let the export sector grow. Even the Nigerians were talking&#13;
about using their own money to support the growth of the economy outside the oil sector. But&#13;
there you had South Asia which was petrified, and I became very impatient with them.&#13;
&#13;
Looking at individual projects in irrigation in India, there too we began to recognize problems&#13;
emerging. I went to Karnataka where they were having a dam built, and there were maybe&#13;
200,000 people who all lived on the embankments of the main canals. They were protesting&#13;
because there were tree plantations in the higher regions of the area, and I began to get&#13;
worried about the Bank's involvement. I talked to Gaby [Gabriel J.] Tibor, our leading&#13;
irrigation engineer, about dam safety and asked him to go to Karnataka and have a look at&#13;
what kind of a problem we might have if we were to press on with the Narmada dam. So&#13;
while there were frustrations about the inability to solve obvious problems, I did enjoy the&#13;
interaction with the professionals on the Indian side. I also enjoyed working with the good old&#13;
project types in the Bank, the irrigation engineers and the power engineers, but I never had the&#13;
feeling of any breakthrough.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: What always astonished me was the fact that although we spent enormous&#13;
amounts of resources on the supervision of our projects, we couldn't establish mechanisms&#13;
that would give the Indians a clearer sense of responsibility for their own projects. Did that&#13;
ever bother you?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: That worked very well in Pakistan and Bangladesh where we integrated the&#13;
borrower's side into the resident missions that we had there. I remember in Bangladesh every&#13;
critical decision that was made in the Ministry of Planning was made in consultation with the&#13;
Resident Mission, so there was constant interaction. We had maybe thirty people in&#13;
Bangladesh and thirty in Pakistan who were somehow related to the resident mission either as&#13;
consultants or as local staff who had their own connection with the institutions they came&#13;
from, e.g. the departments of irrigation, transport, education etc. We never managed to do that&#13;
in India as the government was too diffuse. At one stage I made the decision to establish an&#13;
agriculture division out there because I really didn't think that we could have effective&#13;
supervision from such a distance, so I sent the whole division out there. But that had its own&#13;
problems because there was no agricultural department back home and they went native out&#13;
there. Some of my successors undid this, but it was an attempt to get closer to the&#13;
Bangladesh/Pakistan model of project supervision, which was really quite successful. But&#13;
India, again, was too amorphous, too resisting, too complex, and too geographically remote.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
You couldn't really have one unit as in Bangladesh that could know what's going on in the&#13;
different states of the union.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now in 1984 the great moment finally came: you went back to West Africa, and&#13;
this time was it as the boss of the whole region. Was this something that you knew was going&#13;
to happen?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Well, nobody ever promised you anything in the Bank, but as I said earlier, I&#13;
had been given to understand that my time would come in due course to move up. I didn't&#13;
expect that they would send me to Latin America. By that time, the Berg Report had been&#13;
completed and the deficiencies in Africa's economic and fiscal policies were well exposed.&#13;
Many of our projects were in trouble, and in '84 the first experiments with program lending&#13;
had already been made. But there was no cohesion, experiments all over the place. West&#13;
Africa was still an outpost with a few Frenchman, a few Africans, and plantation&#13;
agriculturists. There were essentially two tasks: one was to move governments to adopt&#13;
sensible strategies, and the other was to take a genuine approach towards program lending in&#13;
support of sensible reforms. All that was left, then, was to generate enough excitement in the&#13;
Bank to attract the people who would willingly go along with it.&#13;
&#13;
My appointment was not an isolated one. Kim Jaycox was sent to East Africa that very same&#13;
day. We had worked together in the old projects department and got promoted on the same&#13;
day in 1972. So, in fact, it was a nice feeling having a like-minded guy on the other side of&#13;
Africa, as we both felt that it would make it easier in carrying out our responsibilities. I&#13;
remember we went together to DAC [Development Assistance Committee] to attend the&#13;
discussions of the Berg Report. I enjoyed the challenge we faced tremendously from day one.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: [Alden W.] Clausen was then the President of the Bank. Can you talk about him&#13;
a little? Did you look to him as a leader who was giving signals that would guide you?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. I saw more ofhim than I did ofMcNamara but got less inspiration from&#13;
him than from McNamara. The man looked lost to me and seemed to be completely in the&#13;
hands of the senior vice president. I remember very clearly the attempts to reorganize the&#13;
Bank by sending [Moeen A.] Qureshi back to IFC, making Wapenhans the financial man, and&#13;
essentially Ernie Stem the senior vice president. I remember the endless discussions about the&#13;
Bank in the '80s, which were pushed at that time by Benjenk. I remember the President's&#13;
Council, where I would show up as vice president. I felt that the Bank was drifting, that it had&#13;
lost its political bearing. McNamara had left because he knew that he couldn't swing the U.S.&#13;
Treasury, but this was not something that Clausen remedied by the fact that he was a&#13;
respected banker. All that was very clear to me before I became a vice president. So the&#13;
decision-making apparatus and also the vision were no longer part of the President's office.&#13;
The President struggled with the outside world, especially the U.S. Treasury, but the results of&#13;
these fights were not really shared with us. We learned little about it.&#13;
&#13;
I went with him on a trip to Africa, one single trip as vice president. I found him, in human&#13;
terms, to be a sweet fellow. He would tell me stories about his wife packing the suitcase with&#13;
a shirt for every day. I don't think that he ever learned to understand the Africans on this trip.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was he interested in them?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah, he was interested, but it was a little outside ofhis world. We had&#13;
discussions in Africa about Indonesia, and I could see the man understood Indonesia. He had&#13;
presided over a big expansion of his private bank, and his bank's engagements in Indonesia&#13;
weren't half as bad as it later turned out to be in Latin America. He understood that the&#13;
Indonesians needed to establish an appropriate macro-framework so that investments could&#13;
succeed. He had an image of how an Indonesian would respond if given a choice between&#13;
different policies, what that would do to his incentives, and what the Bank could do to nudge&#13;
it. But he did not know how this could work in Africa. He did his duty. He went along, he&#13;
went through the policy discussions, but he was both horrified by the magnitude of the&#13;
countries' problems and also puzzled.&#13;
&#13;
I remember in Guinea we were walking through the biggest graveyard of machinery he or&#13;
even I had ever seen. There was twenty years of development assistance rotting in the fields.&#13;
You could feed a steel mill with the scrap that was spread across the countryside. We had a&#13;
few projects in Guinea. We were trying to help them recognize that there had to be some&#13;
turnaround. The president of the country, after Sekou Toure, was a very kind and thoughtful&#13;
man who later was murdered. He was a military man who had thrown away his uniform and&#13;
truly wanted to be helpful. He was confronted with the mess of coming out of the misguided&#13;
policies following independence, reminiscent I had already seen in Indonesia right after&#13;
Suharto. Seeing that mess in Guinea, a very active president would have said, "Wilfried, this&#13;
is not development. There is no perspective, no vision, there is no help possible unless they&#13;
have a sensible program. Therefore, either we get out of here or we really have a very close&#13;
relationship with them." I told Clausen that we do have that choice in the end. His main&#13;
feeling, I thought, was that he was glad to get out of the country. He did not feel that we&#13;
could cope with this. Now, it would be unfair if I judged him as a President by that&#13;
experience. I didn't know how he acted in Brazil or in India, but I did, indirectly, in&#13;
Indonesia. There was very little leadership there.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now you seem to say that the Bank was drifting at the time, but at the same time&#13;
you had Ernie Stem in full charge, a senior vice president who was really very tough and&#13;
involved in every decision, who had a system to control what was happening all over the&#13;
place, and who seemed to have some perspective on where the Bank should go and how we&#13;
should position ourselves. How do you reconcile these two statements: on the one hand, a&#13;
President who was not in charge and hence the impression that the Bank was adrift, and on&#13;
the other hand, a tough manager who was in control and who understood what was&#13;
happening?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: I didn't say the Bank was adrift. What I essentially said, with the anecdotes of&#13;
my trip and of my interaction with Clausen, that this particular President did not feel that he&#13;
could give a vision and a direction to the work of the Bank in Africa. This happened in some&#13;
other regions as well. That doesn't mean that the Bank was adrift.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There were three elements of ferment in the Bank that I recognized very clearly. First, there&#13;
was Stern leading the Bank into program assistance, on which I had previously worked for&#13;
fifteen years, and which I liked. The policy-based lending providing freely available foreign&#13;
exchange to grease the transition into different policies, which would not be costless. That&#13;
was something that the staff of the Bank began to grasp. This was certainly a movement&#13;
which was designed to allow us to respond to Africa's problems. All these overall studies on&#13;
Africa, first Elliot Berg's report and then our own work, was feeding straight into changing&#13;
the Bank from a pure investment institution to one that had two or three instruments. So there&#13;
was no drift in the Bank, but there was clearly a new development.&#13;
&#13;
Second, it became very clear that the Bank could not stand aside on the debt issue. This was&#13;
the post-Mexico period, and some of the worries that I had in the '70s about the indebtedness&#13;
of Senegal or even Nigeria--which in the '70s had earned $25 billion a year and was building&#13;
up a portfolio of debt clearly showing that they went overboard--were things that were now&#13;
out in the open and linked to the whole question external credit-worthiness. The recovery&#13;
from the debt problems again was linked back to structural adjustment lending. So if&#13;
anything there was an absence of drift in the Bank: there were new designs.&#13;
&#13;
Where the top people ofthe Bank were probably the least influential of all was in West&#13;
Africa. The body of knowledge, the repertoire of indicators that Mr. Stern would have on&#13;
hand when something would go wrong in Pakistan or Mexico or Indonesia, was not there.&#13;
The ideas and the prescriptions were there and applicable, but the sense of what could go&#13;
wrong, when and how to intervene, Stern was unable to determine in West Africa, and barely&#13;
in East Africa.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Did this have something to do with a language barrier?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. There are always two things you need when you want to succeed: you&#13;
have to have an idea and your repertoire of indicators. Today, thirty years after I started&#13;
working in transportation, I still know at what per ton kilometer cost I can say that a project is&#13;
a failure. There are typical indicators alerting you when India or Mexico go wrong. Stern had&#13;
this list of indicators for Asia, but he had no yellow lights that would warn him in West&#13;
Africa. He understood the Nigerian's debt problems, the terms of trade issues in Ghana, and&#13;
the excessive reliance on plantation agriculture in the Ivory Coast. But that was about it. For&#13;
the rest, I had to say to him, "I accept your general ideas but I will make the following&#13;
specific suggestions because I know how things work down there." This gave me a degree of&#13;
independence which others did not have. I profited from the relative freedom and was relieved&#13;
that I didn't have a "senior loan officer" for West Africa sitting on top of me as we always&#13;
had when we dealt with India. That made the difference.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now, you stayed in West Africa happily until1987. At the time when Clausen&#13;
left and [Barber B.] Conable came to the Bank, did you have any early encounters with&#13;
Conable? What was your impression of him?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: The first mention ofConable I heard in Ernie's office during one ofthese&#13;
chats one had as a vice president with him. He had obviously learned who was going to be the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                      January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
next President of the Bank, and he mentioned the name on the phone not caring that I was&#13;
sitting there. His first response on the phone was, "Oh! This is very much an inward looking&#13;
choice." These are the words he used, and that there is going to be more learning to be done&#13;
than even the last time.&#13;
&#13;
I then met Conable relatively soon. I liked him. I found him warm, interested in individuals,&#13;
and honest in admitting if he didn't know something. Unlike Clausen, who didn't easily admit&#13;
that he knew so little, Conable said, "I'm reading and reading here and I'm trying to learn."&#13;
We sent him these enormous briefing books before he came. I was a little worried about the&#13;
people he surrounded himself with. There was a young lady who had worked on the Hill,&#13;
Judith McGuire, and then there was Bill[William J.] Stanton, the former congressman who&#13;
was very close to him. Here was a person with whom, it was pretty clear, I would not have the&#13;
kind of trouble I had with Clausen. I could simply tell him, "Look, I give you a few options,&#13;
but you need some time to think about them." But I was getting very concerned about his&#13;
depth of understanding of the Bank and the increasing bitterness in the relation between Stem&#13;
and Qureshi. It became pretty clear to me that Conable was going to depend on these two&#13;
fellows and had to find a way to deal with the struggle between them.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Were you a witness to some of these fights?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: Yeah. As vice president I attended some of the President'Â·s Council meetings.&#13;
Even with Clausen, the interchanges between Stern and Qureshi were often very sharp. You&#13;
would have a situation in which Qureshi would stay the gentleman and stay exceedingly&#13;
polite, taking in the argument of the other person, and Ernie would get very impatient with the&#13;
apparent evasiveness that was implicit in Qureshi's politeness. This had started under&#13;
Clausen. To this day, I do not think that there were unbridgeable differences of view over the&#13;
basic course for the Bank to follow, which made it doubly sad.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It was essentially a matter of style?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: It was a matter of style, and I must say in the case of Stern, a matter of&#13;
ruthlessly wanting to be acknowledged as the leader. Stem was not capable of collective&#13;
leadership. I was on Qureshi's side because he was ready to put in his two bits and never&#13;
fought some of the epochal Stem interventions. There were no problems in principle, there&#13;
were personality problems, problems over relations with the outside, but essentially the&#13;
struggle was a quest for leadership that Qureshi did not take lying down. He had his own&#13;
ways of counter-maneuvering. When Conable came, I was getting very worried about a new&#13;
man being paired up with these two gentlemen and worried about the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Now the new man, in fact, more or less walked into the Bank and said this place&#13;
needs to be reorganized. What was your sense? Did you feel at the time that there was a need&#13;
for a reorganization, let alone one of the magnitude that was eventually instituted?&#13;
&#13;
THALWITZ: No. I was, during this whole debate about the reorganization, a conservative. I&#13;
tried to slow down Kim Jaycox, who at that time began to take off. He was a little aloof,&#13;
getting very involved in the design of the reorganization and no longer ready to go back to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
                     January 22, February 12 and 28, 1996- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               53&#13;
&#13;
basics and question the need for change. I talked to Conable about my concerns, and his&#13;
reaction was very mild when I gave him some specifics. Some of the same arguments I made&#13;
were made by David Knox, who eventually got fired over it. I didn't.&#13;
&#13;
Now, it's important to say what my concerns were. I had welcomed the '72 reorganization&#13;
with the introduction of the country focus, but I was getting worried in the '87 reorganization&#13;
when I recognized that the design of the TD [technical department] was no way to maintain&#13;
the sectoral capacity over more than three little countries. I always knew that there was a&#13;
balance between country and sectoral concerns and one had to find a matrix way of squaring&#13;
this. It is funny to see now in the Bank of 1996 the consolidation by region of the sectoral&#13;
capacity is again a central issue. The contractual relationship between the country&#13;
management and the sectoral expertise is precisely the proposal I made to Marianne Haug,&#13;
then Conable's assistant, and then to Conable himself. Knox said exactly the same thing. I&#13;
don't think he said it any more sharply or unpleasantly, but he got axed.&#13;
&#13;
The other concern was that I was already very suspicious of what in the American industry&#13;
had become known as management by objectives, strategic planning, and the linkage of&#13;
macro research to strategic planning. I was also getting suspicious of the design of the PPR&#13;
[Project Planning and Research], which is funny as later on I was put in charge of it. These&#13;
were my two major points.&#13;
&#13;
A third point, which I didn't know anything about in the beginning, was the blood-letting that&#13;
occurred in the process of the reorganization and the particular way that it was dealt with. I&#13;
didn't see its relation to the objectives of the reorganization. It seemed there was a separate&#13;
reorganization on the personnel side by a principle of selection from the top down which&#13;
made for a lot of bad blood. The effect of this five years later was that we were re-&#13;
accumulating the people who were in the wrong spot but then our hands were tied as nobody&#13;
wanted to repeat anything that was done in 1987. In fact, we became excessively soft because&#13;
we had been so excessively callous in '87.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Who was the author and the inventor of this approach? This was essentially the&#13;
implementation part of the reorganization: everybody got fired and then had to be rehired into&#13;
the Bank in a process very much like the game of musical chairs. Was that Kim's idea or was&#13;
it the consultants' proposal or did Conable have anything to do with it?&#13;
&#13;
THAL WITZ: I think it was Kim's idea. I never talked to any consultants, so I don't know&#13;
what their influence was. I talked a lot to Marianne Haug, Kim Jaycox, a little to [Caio K.]&#13;
Koch-Weser, Russ [Russell J.] Cheetham, basically with the members of the committee that&#13;
we had to handle the reorganization. I also talked to Conable about it. I think that the&#13;
selecting back into the Bank was Kim's idea, combined with an assessment that this required&#13;
a lot of money, which is where the packages came in. I remember having these discussions Â·&#13;
with Kim whenever I didn't really know what mechanism to use for selecting in or out. A lot&#13;
of money was required to make this painless, and it didn't tum out to be all that painless.&#13;
&#13;
But my main concern was related to the two aspects I mentioned at the beginning. How do&#13;
you provide a corporate perspective to the President, to a President who wants change but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     January 22, February 12 and 28,1996- Verbatim&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
knows neither the old Bank nor has a clear idea as to where he wants to take the present&#13;
Bank? So the need for strategic planning and the loss of the sectoral expertise as the result of&#13;
the endless splitting of the organization into these small units, those things were, in my mind,&#13;
much more weighty than the damage that I later learned had occurred later in the process of&#13;
implementing the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Thank you very much, Wilfried.&#13;
