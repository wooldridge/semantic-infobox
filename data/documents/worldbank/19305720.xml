These papers are a product of the South Asia Poverty Reduction and Economic Management&#13;
Unit. They are part of a larger effort by the World Bank to provide open access to its research&#13;
and make a contribution to development policy discussions in Pakistan and around the&#13;
world. Policy Working Papers are also posted on the Web at http://econ.worldbank.org. The&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
This policy paper aims to assist policy makers, as they develop the Pakistan Innovation&#13;
Policy, with an independent assessment of where Pakistan stands now, an international&#13;
perspective on policy priorities, a review of policy options and some implementation and&#13;
institutional perspectives. The paper begins with a review of the key lessons of international&#13;
experience together with a study of key international benchmarks. It takes a look at the&#13;
ecosystem approach which maps the effectiveness of all the various players in innovation and&#13;
also reviews progress against 12 â&#128;&#156;triple helixâ&#128;? critical success factors.1 The possible policy&#13;
options are then enumerated and evaluated for relevance. Finally, some perspectives are&#13;
provided on how to move the innovation agenda forward.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Policy Working Paper Series disseminates the findings of work in progress to encourage&#13;
the exchange of ideas about development issues. An objective of the series is to get the&#13;
findings out quickly, even if the presentations are less than fully polished. The papers carry&#13;
the names of the authors and should be cited accordingly. The findings, interpretations, and&#13;
conclusions expressed in this paper are entirely those of the authors. They do not necessarily&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                       Toward an Innovation Policy for Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
1.      Pushing the innovation agenda in Pakistan has the potential to be a game changer.&#13;
Evidence shows much stronger productivity and competitiveness for the few Pakistani firms&#13;
that eschew innovative behaviors such as developing new products, markets, investing in&#13;
quality systems and research and development. The challenge therefore is to encourage vast&#13;
majority of firms that do not exhibit these behaviors to do so. In most cases this means&#13;
adopting practices and technologies that already exist in Pakistan (new to the firm); in other&#13;
cases it is adapting practices and technologies that work well in other countries (new to the&#13;
market) and occasionally it means original innovation that is new to the world. The&#13;
Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s growth strategy recognizes this opportunity and emphasizes the role that&#13;
innovation can play in improving productivity and thereby driving growth.&#13;
&#13;
2.     There are many important lessons Pakistan can learn from international experiences.&#13;
Probably the most important finding is that while there are likely to be some benefits from&#13;
encouraging commercialization of research the big pay off will come from encouraging firms&#13;
to use existing technologies. In parallel the building blocks for a typical middle-income&#13;
country innovation agenda, which often emphasizes research and development and&#13;
academic business linkages, can be quietly worked on. However, neither of these agendas&#13;
can be worked on in isolation.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The policy mix required to encourage firms to innovate more is a complex interaction&#13;
of general business-enabling environment reforms, increased competitiveness, key&#13;
infrastructure investments (mainly in ICT sector), appropriate firm-level support and&#13;
establishing dynamic relationships between academia, firms and government. A detailed&#13;
analysis using the triple helix model of 12 policy pillars identifies many areas of policy&#13;
reform, capacity building and the design of supporting measures. These 12 pillars are: (i)&#13;
fiscal policy, (ii) government procurement policies, (iii) infrastructure for innovation, (iv)&#13;
small business entrepreneurship, (v) technology and business model acquisition, (vi)&#13;
education, (vii) venture capital and commercialization, (viii) attitudes toward risk, (ix)&#13;
encouragement of patents, (x) intellectual property protection, (xi) university-industry&#13;
linkages and (xii) incubators and technical parks.&#13;
&#13;
4.     Combining this analysis with a detailed evaluation of the innovation ecosystem in&#13;
Pakistan reveals that there is significant scope to strengthen the components of the&#13;
innovation ecosystem. The following areas merit particular attention:&#13;
   ï&#130;· There is a multiplicity of institutions engaged in trying to deliver and coordinate&#13;
       various aspects of innovation;&#13;
   ï&#130;· Most of the key agencies involved in innovation lack adequate funding and can do&#13;
       little more than pay salaries of their staff;&#13;
   ï&#130;· There is a lack of a champion as there is no â&#128;&#156;nodalâ&#128;? agency and there is no guiding&#13;
       policy or plan. At the straight coordination level there is National University of&#13;
       Science and Technology (NUST), the Competitive Support Fund (CSF) and others. It&#13;
       is surprising to note that there is no strong Ministerial lead on the topic; and&#13;
   ï&#130;· There are very little resources allocated to innovation in Pakistan. While there are&#13;
       subsidies (mainly in the form of export subsidies) for the key productive sectors and&#13;
       significant resource allocations to knowledge providers in Pakistan, very little is&#13;
       oriented toward encouraging innovation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             1&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
5.      Regarding the actions, among the most important one is to establish the overarching&#13;
institutional frameworkâ&#128;&#148;this could take several forms. International experience suggests: a&#13;
formal cabinet appointment to task the managing, monitoring and implementing of the&#13;
policy; meaningful coordination mechanisms by an interagency coordinating body, perhaps&#13;
with the support of Memorandum of Understandings (performance contracts etc.) with&#13;
implementing agencies; public-private dialogue mechanisms and continuous emphasis on&#13;
this policy at the highest levelsâ&#128;&#148;i.e. in India the President has nominated this decade as â&#128;&#156;the&#13;
Decade of Innovation.â&#128;? Notice that only when the overall policy is agreed, the need, if any,&#13;
for enabling legislation should be determined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             2&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Toward an Innovation Policy for Pakistan&#13;

&#13;
Introduction&#13;
6.      The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s growth strategy2 emphasizes the role that innovation can play in&#13;
improving productivity and thereby driving growth. Pushing the innovation agenda in&#13;
Pakistan has the potential to be a game changer. Innovations that can help unlock the&#13;
inherent productivity of Pakistani firms can generate the needed jobs and levels of growth. It&#13;
is certainly not an agenda in isolation. To be truly effective it needs to be part of a broader&#13;
suite of reforms that are well captured by the â&#128;&#156;Pakistan: Framework for Economic Growth&#13;
2011â&#128;?. In particular the notions of vibrant markets and creative cities are central to the&#13;
innovation agenda. Introducing innovation in a significant and systematic way when&#13;
combined with an appetite for risk taking3 (entrepreneurship) can drive Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s growth&#13;
rates to the targets it is aiming for. The contrast illustrated in Figure 1 between Pakistan and&#13;
Korea is particularly telling and demonstrates the potential that innovation, as a critical&#13;
component of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), has to offer. The international experience&#13;
suggests that to make progress in this area a well calibrated innovation policy can be very&#13;
helpful. Indeed this is recognized by policy makers and some important initial steps have&#13;
been taken.4&#13;

7.       When one looks at international innovation benchmark indicators, Pakistan tends to&#13;
fall in the bottom quartile. There are at least three internationally comparable indexes on&#13;
innovation which are listed in Table 1 below. The benchmarks that look at innovation inputs&#13;
and outputs, and as a result bring in external factors such as levels of human development&#13;
and the business climate score Pakistan lower than the World Economic Forum index. The&#13;

Place for the Futureâ&#128;? which outlined a number of important recommendations.&#13;

                                                                                                        3&#13;

&#13;
index uses perception measures rather than quantitative measures and looks at innovation&#13;
systems as a subset of a broader competitiveness ranking. Not surprisingly with these&#13;
differences there is a lot of debate on how to measure innovation.5 If there is a bottom line it&#13;
is clear whatever measure is used there is substantial room for improvement.&#13;

&#13;
8.       These findings of poor innovation performance are reinforced when firm-level data&#13;
on Pakistan is examined. The 2007 Enterprise Survey reveals that Pakistani firms exhibit&#13;
little in the way of innovative behavior. When one looks at how many firms introduced new&#13;
products or technologies the score is significantly low (see Figure 2). This is particularly&#13;
disturbing as this is where innovation countsâ&#128;&#148;it is the innovation that takes place in firms&#13;
that drive growth. Pakistan does not make it to Gartnerâ&#128;&#153;s top-30 countries for globally&#13;
sourced activities, while India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka do.&#13;
&#13;
9.      If there is good news, there are remarkable differences in allocative efficiency&#13;
between firms in the same sector. As can be seen in Figure 3, there is significant variation in&#13;
productivity with firms in the same country and Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s variability is almost double th e&#13;
next comparatorâ&#128;&#147;the Philippines. This means that some firms have figured it out and rank&#13;
amongst the worldâ&#128;&#153;s most productive enterprises, but at the same time, most havenâ&#128;&#153;t. For&#13;
these firms that arenâ&#128;&#153;t as productive, this presents a tremendous opportunity for growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
5 Egils Milbergs and Nicholas Vonortas propose a set of metrics that capture the dynamics of the innovation&#13;
Ecosystem (knowledge indicators, networks and conditions for innovation). See â&#128;&#156;Innovation Metrics&#13;
Measurement and Insight.â&#128;? http://www.innovationtools.com/pdf/innovation-metrics-nii.pdf&#13;
6 The study measured both innovation inputs and outputs. Innovation inputs included government and fiscal&#13;
&#13;
policy, education policy and the innovation environment. Outputs included patents, technology transfer, and&#13;
other R&amp;D results; business performance, such as labor productivity and total shareholder returns, and; the&#13;
impact of innovation on business migration and economic growth.&#13;
7 Perception-based index on 7 different indicators. http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-competitiveness&#13;
8 The index identifies over 60 factors that are seen to have a bearing on a countryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to create an&#13;
&#13;
environment that encourages innovation, such as a nationâ&#128;&#153;s institutional environment, human capi tal&#13;
endowment, the presence of social inclusion, the regulatory and legal framework, the infrastructure for research&#13;
and development, and the adoption and use of information and communication technologies, among others. 90&#13;
percent of the variables used in the construction of the Index are â&#128;&#156;hardâ&#128;?â&#128;&#148;i.e. measuring directly some underlying&#13;
factors, such as the budget deficit, expenditure in education or cumbersome regulations etc. â&#128;&#148;and, therefore, are&#13;
not dependent on a survey instrument. See http://www.innovationfordevelopmentreport.org&#13;

10.     Innovation is a relative concept that refers to upgraded technological capabilities in a&#13;
firm that lead to productivity improvements which in turn drive growth and employment. 9&#13;
These innovations can be new to the firm, new to the market (see Box 1) or new to the world&#13;
(see Box 2). The channels by which this up-gradation occurs can be through original research&#13;
and development (R&amp;D), the adoption of existing technologies that have not yet been applied&#13;
in a firm and through inputs that embody the innovation. In other words a new invention,&#13;
introduction of a new product line or service, the development of a new market and the&#13;
&#13;
9 Technology includes improved business and organizational processes. Business development services support&#13;
these kinds of processes.&#13;

in these innovation activities is one of the important factors to determine firmâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
performance. Firm-level data clearly indicates the difference of performance between the&#13;
firms which have engaged in these innovation activities and the firms which have not (see&#13;

   Box 1       New to Market Innovation: Coke Studio Brings Fame to Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s Music&#13;
               Industry&#13;
                      An international franchise that started in Brazil, was picked up by a young Pakistani&#13;
                      musician (Rohail Hyatt) and his Wife (Umber) in year 2008. Ever since then, the four&#13;
                      seasons of Coke Studio have brought international fame to Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s musicians and&#13;
                      singers, and has attracted over 400,000 fans on Facebook alone. Rohail and Umber&#13;
 have worked very hard to manage a fusion of the diverse musical influences in Pakistan, including eastern&#13;
 classical, folk, and contemporary popular music. Therefore, this has turned out to be a remarkable&#13;
 opportunity for renowned as well as upcoming and less mainstream artists, from various genres and&#13;
 regions, to collaborate musically in live studio recording sessions. Commenting on the performance of a&#13;
 renowned folk singer in the show, Rohail says â&#128;&#156;What I have tried to do with this song is to present a&#13;
 modern Attaullah Esakhelvi (the singer) to his fans. We have carved the music around him as he would&#13;
 sing in any case. Even with experimentation, we have stayed true to form and tradition while including&#13;
 modern elementsâ&#128;¦â&#128;? Coke Studio shows the promise that innovation has for diverse industries across the&#13;
 country. Thus, Coke Studio is an example of how an existing technology can be brought from Brazil, and&#13;
 then adapted and enhanced.&#13;

   Box 2      New to the World of Innovation: Gul Ahmed Brings in â&#128;&#156;ideasâ&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           Gul Ahmed, headquartered in Karachi, initiated textile trading business in early&#13;
                           1900s, and started manufacturing in 1953. After decades of experiences, Gul&#13;
                           Ahmed has evolved into one of the largest composite textile houses in the world&#13;
 with a capacity of 130,000 spindles and 250 high-speed air-jet looms. In 2003, it launched a retail venture&#13;
 called â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;Ideas by Gul Ahmedâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153; in Pakistan, offering a range of home textiles and apparel goods to the&#13;
 customers. As of 2010, Gul Ahmed has more than 30 retail outlets throughout Pakistan, and in 2010, Gul&#13;
 Ahmed achieved a sales record of more than US$ 200 million (Export sales account for more than 50% of&#13;
 the entire sales record).&#13;
&#13;
                         The success of Ideas lies in its simple but innovative business model which&#13;
                         organically integrates all the manufacturing sections with very sophisticated&#13;
                         quality control system which utilizes information and communications technology&#13;
 (ICT). This system has enabled Gul Ahmed to create high-quality unique products as well as increased&#13;
 efficiency in the process of designing, sewing, spinning and warehousing. It is also noteworthy that Gul&#13;
 Ahmed has invested in R&amp;D, as opposed to a majority of Pakistani firms. Owing to this, domestic and&#13;
 international designers could produce approximately 1,000 designs with various fabrics including lawn,&#13;
 linen and chiffon each year. This has made it possible for Gul Ahmed to cater to various segments of&#13;
 customers in Europe, US, Middle East and South Asia around the year. In addition, its unique advertising&#13;
 strategy has elevated its brand image. Gul Ahmed issues a seasonal style magazine for the fashion&#13;
 conscious men and women. Available at all leading bookstores and at Gul Ahmedâ&#128;&#153;s boutiques in urban&#13;
 centers, this magazine has models sporting Gul Ahmed products (mostly apparel and accessories) in latest&#13;
 trends and cuts. Following suit, all leading brands of the country including Nishat Linen, Sana Safinas,&#13;
 Leisure Club, Cross Roads and more are now investing in their own fashion guides to attract more buyers.&#13;
 In year 2009, Gul Ahmed was awarded â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;Pakistan France Trade Performance Awardâ&#128;?. Thus, Gul Ahmed&#13;
 building from a platform of existing technologies was able to develop â&#128;&#156;new to the worldâ&#128;? fashion designs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Toward an Innovation Policy for Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.    The innovation agenda in Pakistan is confused. Not surprisingly given the foregoing&#13;
findings, innovation means different things to different people. The emphasis is on research&#13;
focusing on â&#128;&#156;new-to-the-worldâ&#128;? opportunities. This is an important innovation opportunity&#13;
where the greatest return lies in transferring existing technology to Pakistani firms.&#13;
&#13;
12.    Moreover innovation is the key to breaking the rent-seeking cycle which places a&#13;
major brake on entrepreneurship in Pakistan. As Professor Auerswald argues in a recent&#13;
study on entrepreneurship in Pakistan â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦ for business, creating a space for the future means&#13;
seeking advantage not in regulatory protections that stifle social development but in market&#13;
innovations that accelerate it.â&#128;? 10&#13;
&#13;
Key International Lessons of Experience&#13;
13.    There are a number of important lessons from international experiences. Those that&#13;
require little in the way of elaboration:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Competition is the key driver of innovation. If there is little competition, there is little&#13;
       incentive to innovate.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Innovation does not live in a vacuum11â&#128;&#148;strength of the regulatory environment and&#13;
       levels of infrastructure are particularly the great innovation enablers.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Information and Communications Technology (ICT) plays a key role:&#13;
             o ICT deserves special attention given its impact within the firm, its&#13;
                 connectivity and its ability to generate innovations in its own right (See Box 3)&#13;
             o ICT, especially e-business adoption and on-line business registration services,&#13;
                 has a great potential for enhancing productivity and lowering barriers to&#13;
                 market entry among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Besides, ICT&#13;
                 could play an important role in promoting fair competition among firms by&#13;
                 increasing the transparency of transaction and lowering room for&#13;
                 administrative discretion.12&#13;
    ï&#130;· The level of human development also determines the ability of a country to innovate.&#13;
       Countries that are at cutting edge of innovation have invested more in development&#13;
       of their human resource through more and better opportunities for education and&#13;
       research.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Recent analysis of countries with a better Doing Business rank (both the overall rank&#13;
       and indicators on getting credit and registering property) show higher propensities&#13;
       for young entrepreneurial firms to innovate, in terms of new product or process&#13;
       innovations. Unfortunately for Pakistan there are very few young entrepreneurial&#13;
       firmsâ&#128;&#148;in the last four years, new firm registrations lie between 3,041 and 4,781 per&#13;
       annum13, which is merely 10% of the number of registrations in New Zealandâ&#128;&#147;the&#13;

      ï&#130;·   Institutional capacity (monitoring and evaluation, coordination, policy development&#13;
          and financing) is needed to drive innovation development&#13;
      ï&#130;·   Innovation plays a big role in the development of the key economic sectors. In&#13;
          Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s case, this is agriculture and major crops including cotton, rice and sugar&#13;
          cane. With an improved R&amp;D and innovative solutions, the sector can benefit&#13;
          tremendously from better farm inputs and agro processing technologies. This would&#13;
          increase the shelf life and quality of the produce and strengthen the agricultural value&#13;
          chains thereby creating better market linkages and employment opportunities.&#13;

      Box 3    Ovex Technologies Pakistan: Both an Innovator and an Enabler of Innovation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              The ICT sector is taking on increasing importance in todayâ&#128;&#153;s economic society. It&#13;
                              is not only emerging as an engine of economic growth but is also playing a vital&#13;
                              role in fostering innovation among various firms and industries by providing&#13;
 them with a platform and infrastructure to promote innovation. The ICT industry in Pakistan started playing&#13;
 the role of an innovation enabler against a backdrop of a growing number of innovative enterprises in the&#13;
 sector, since the early 2000s. Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s estimated domestic and export revenues for FY 2010 in the IT sector&#13;
                                                                                                    14&#13;
 was more than US$ 500 million (of which domestic revenues constitutes 30% of the total revenues).&#13;
&#13;
 Among them, OVEX Technologies Pakistan Limited (with offices in Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi) has played&#13;
 a pioneering role in promoting innovation among various firms in Pakistan and overseas by providing BPO&#13;
 (Business Process Outsourcing), IT solutions and software services since its inception in 2003. As of 2010,&#13;
 OVEX had US$ 1.5 million of revenues with approximately 300 employees. Its clients range from Ufone, Zong&#13;
 and SNGPL (Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd) to other firms in US and Canada. In 2009, OVEX introduced state-&#13;
 of-the-art ICT infrastructure and communication system for SNGPL. After the implementation of the new&#13;
 information system, SNGPL has enabled its regions and sub-regions to gain access to national knowledge&#13;
 base including handling of emergency complaints in a timely fashion. It has also smoothened communication&#13;
 within SNGPL, which has enabled rapid service delivery to its customers. Owing to this innovative system,&#13;
 SNGPL could decrease operation cost significantly while enhancing customer satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
 Currently, OVEX has been trying to establish innovative interactive communication system in Quaid-i-Azam&#13;
 International Hospital (QIH). With this information system, QIH would enable its doctors to gain access to&#13;
 global knowledge base including US based doctors at any time. Once this system is introduced, QIH could&#13;
 provide world-class medical services to its patients by taking advantage of global medical knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
 The CEO of OVEX Technologies Pakistan, Faisal Khan, mentioned that OVEX is a platform of growth,&#13;
 development and innovation. He described some innovative IT firms in Pakistan such as OVEX that have&#13;
 started to serve as a facilitator of innovation among various firms and industries by providing business&#13;
 enabling infrastructure and fostering knowledge sharing activities among them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.       Lessons from international experiences that need a little more explanation:&#13;
      ï&#130;·   A countryâ&#128;&#153;s level of development mattersâ&#128;&#148;the distance a firm is from the frontier of&#13;
          what is technologically possible is a strong determinant of the effectiveness of R&amp;D&#13;
          expenditures&#13;
      ï&#130;·   There is often the need to create a culture that embraces and encourages innovation&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                       Toward an Innovation Policy for Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   While policies should not pick winners, a granular examination from an innovation&#13;
       perspective of key sectors e.g. textiles can yield powerful insights&#13;
   ï&#130;·   It is important to make markets work for the private sector through appropriate&#13;
       interventions. Market failures can hinder innovation and therefore require the state&#13;
       to focus on elements that can address various constraints to the markets such as&#13;
       monopolies, subsidies, corruption and absence of well documented land records.&#13;
&#13;
15.    Why is that low income countries struggle to get returns on Research &amp; Development&#13;
(R&amp;D)? Research shows that middle-income countries get high returns when it comes to&#13;
R&amp;D but low income countries donâ&#128;&#153;t. The reasons include: (i) very few firms in low income&#13;
countries have the capacity to absorb state of the art R&amp;D (for example less than 2% of&#13;
Pakistani firms are formal) and (ii) linkages between firms and knowledge providers are&#13;
weak so R&amp;D is not demand oriented. Therefore there is little opportunity for spillovers in&#13;
the absence of linkages and capabilities. Being on the cusp of low and middle income,&#13;
Pakistan is at a point where there are likely to be returns from encouraging new-to-the-&#13;
market and new-to-the-firm innovation.&#13;
&#13;
16.     How does one create an innovation culture? Steven Johnson the author of â&#128;&#156;Where&#13;
good ideas come from: the Natural History of Innovationâ&#128;? argues this culture of innovation is&#13;
achieved in three ways: (i) encouraging openness and diversity, (ii) allowing and supporting&#13;
failure, and (iii) awareness of oneâ&#128;&#153;s own limitations tied with a willingness to seek help. In&#13;
Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s case some simple questions point to the challenge ahead. How much Foreign&#13;
Direct Investment (FDI) is there in core sectors like textilesâ&#128;&#148;what does this say about&#13;
openness? How easy is it for firms to exit if they fail? What are the consequences of failure?&#13;
How much do large firms internalize their production processes â&#128;&#147;how much do they&#13;
outsource? The answers to these questions are not encouraging and suggest a lot of work is&#13;
required to move Pakistan from a few pockets of innovation (the kind of examples we have&#13;
highlighted in this report) to a situation where an innovation culture is embedded&#13;
throughout Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
17.     But there are clues that suggest an innovation culture can happen. Pakistan has been&#13;
able to deliver on its aspiration to be a nuclear power. The development of Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s nuclear&#13;
capacity is a dramatic example of what is possible on the innovation front in Pakistan. Most&#13;
commentators cite a single-minded long-term focus that transcended political boundaries as&#13;
the key. If similar focus can be brought to areas like bio-technology or ICT, the economic&#13;
benefits can be tremendous.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Rather than trying to innovate across the whole economy some countries have taken&#13;
a sectoral approach. By getting into the granular detail of firm-level productivity in critical&#13;
sectors, particularly those such as textiles, which have had to adjust to major changes in&#13;
international tariff and quota regimes, it has been possible to identify innovations that have&#13;
enabled adaption. Colombia for example moved from producer of low value-added generic&#13;
textiles to a producer of higher value-added differentiated products. It is however important&#13;
to note, that in this approach, institutions have played a very important role in providing the&#13;
desired hand-holding to the firms, and in seeking the buy-in from the public sector, thereby&#13;
achieving the desired regulatory reforms, and finding representation in the policy making.&#13;
The Pakistan Stone Development Company (PASDEC) described in the Box 4 is illustrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             9&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Toward an Innovation Policy for Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of the impact of technological upgrading in a sector, made possible by an institution focused&#13;
on the development of a private sector.&#13;
&#13;
   Box 4       Innovation at the Firm Level: The Pakistan Stone Development Company&#13;
               (PASDEC)&#13;
                             PASDEC is a not-for-profit organization, focused on achieving one goal,&#13;
                             introducing the extraction of â&#128;&#156;Square Blocksâ&#128;? technology to the marble and&#13;
                             gypsum sector. This reduces the wastage factor from 85% to 45% and would&#13;
                             have trickle down effects throughout the value chain of the Industry, achieving&#13;
                             tremendous transformational impact. In the long run, the PASDEC vision for&#13;
  industry is to emerge as a globally competitive dimensional stone industry. The potential has been set as&#13;
  an export target of US$ 2.4 billion in 2017. Already exports of US$ 70 million have been achieved starting&#13;
  from a very low base. PASDEC has the following innovation enhancing initiatives:&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Raising Value Chain Productivity&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Investment in Workforce Development&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Export Marketing&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Promoting Strategic Partnerships (Joint Ventures &amp; Foreign Direct Investment)&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Developing Industrial database &amp; gathering information on markets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.     As innovation has such significant potential to impact economic growth, it is an&#13;
attractive target for subsidies. Indeed many of the countries that have been very successful&#13;
on the innovation front have used subsidies well. As with all subsidies they need to be well&#13;
designed, managed well and dropped if they donâ&#128;&#153;t work. In an influential paper on industrial&#13;
policy Dani Rodrik articulated the following three principles in subsidy design: (i)&#13;
embeddedness (or strategic collaboration and coordination between the public and private&#13;
sectors), (ii) carrots and sticksâ&#128;&#147;the willingness to invest but also withdraw from subsidies&#13;
that are not working, and (iii) accountability. Unfortunately in Pakistan very little of these&#13;
principles are in play. Subsidies once they are granted tend to stay. There is little&#13;
accountability for subsidies and monitoring and evaluation systems are rare.&#13;
&#13;
Innovation Ecosystem&#13;
20.    There is significant scope to strengthen the components of the innovation ecosystem&#13;
in Pakistan. The Pakistan ecosystem is presented in Figure 4. The key components are firms,&#13;
government and knowledge providers. While all these components are represented, there is a&#13;
need to accelerate connections and strengthen critical capacities. When one reviews this&#13;
ecosystem, following observations can be made:&#13;
    1. A multiplicity of institutions engaged in trying to deliver and coordinate various&#13;
       aspects of innovation. There are many relatively insignificant players in Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       innovation ecosystem. At the firm level, National Productivity Organization (NPO),&#13;
       Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (SMEDA), Technology&#13;
       Upgradation and Skill Development Company (TUSDEC), SME Business Support&#13;
       Fund (BSF), Competitiveness Support Fund (CSF), PASDEC, industry associations,&#13;
       and others all promote innovation in a modest way&#13;
    2. A lack of funding for many key playersâ&#128;&#148;most of these agencies lack adequate&#13;
       funding, and can do little more than pay salaries of their staff. In a recent report on&#13;
       SMEDA it was noted â&#128;&#156;the current budget which is less than US$ 2 million, does not&#13;
       allow it (SMEDA) to mobilize enough resources in the form of facilities, trained and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                           10&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Toward an Innovation Policy for Pakistan&#13;

       3. A lack of a champion, as there is no â&#128;&#156;nodalâ&#128;? agency and there is no guiding policy or&#13;
          plan. At the straight coordination level there is National University of Science and&#13;
          Technology (NUST), CSF and others. It is surprising to note that there is no strong&#13;
          ministerial lead on the topic. There are elements in the Planning Commission, the&#13;
          Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Education, but unfortunately, there is no&#13;
          clear champion in the government. What is required is that an existing Ministry be&#13;
          charged with this responsibility which includes the delivery of a clear policy and an&#13;
          accountable implementation plan for cabinet-level approval. For example in Malaysia&#13;
          the Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation has this responsibility.&#13;
       4. There are very little resources allocated to innovation in Pakistan. While there are&#13;
          subsidies (mainly in the form of export subsidies), for the key productive sectors and&#13;
          significant resource allocations to knowledge providers in Pakistan, very little is&#13;

        oriented toward encouraging innovation. The big message from countries like Korea&#13;
        is they used their subsidies very wisely and consistently in support of innovation. A&#13;
        key challenge for policy makers is to find ways to: (i) reorient these existing firm-level&#13;
        subsidies so they move away from encouraging rent seeking to supporting&#13;
        competitiveness and innovation, and (ii) encourage stronger links between&#13;
        knowledge providers and firms.&#13;
&#13;
The Triple Helix&#13;
21.      One way of looking at the innovation system is through the Triple Helix approach&#13;
which identifies 12 pillars of innovation policy engagement. This approach looks at the&#13;
interactions between the three principal actors in an innovation ecosystem16: knowledge&#13;
providers, firms and government. The 12 policy pillars, or as we describe above as critical&#13;
success factors, are: (i) fiscal policy, (ii) government procurement policies, (iii) infrastructure&#13;
for innovation, (iv) small business entrepreneurship, (v) technology and business model&#13;
acquisition, (vi) education, (vii) venture capital and commercialization, (viii) attitudes&#13;
toward risk, (ix) encouragement of patents, (x) intellectually property protection, (xi)&#13;
university-industry linkages, and (xii) incubators and technical parks. For each of these&#13;
pillars, Table 2 looks at their importance, appraises Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s current situation and explores&#13;
the way forward.&#13;

16The Triple Helix (TH) model emerged from a workshop on â&#128;&#156;Evolutionary Economics and Chaos Theory: New&#13;
Directions in Technology Studiesâ&#128;? (Leydesdorff &amp; Van den Besselaar, 1994). Organized with the intention of&#13;
crossing the boundaries between institutional analysis of the knowledge infrastructure, on one hand (Etzkowitz,&#13;
1994), and evolutionary analysis of the knowledge base of an economy, on the other (David &amp; Foray, 1994;&#13;
Nelson, 1994).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Development of an Innovation Policy&#13;
22.     An effective national innovation policy facilitates the creation of conducive conditions&#13;
for innovation across various sectors and institutions. The policy mobilizes and engages&#13;
various stakeholder groups and institutions within the innovation system while defining&#13;
their roles and providing direction. It has to be tailored to country-specific conditions and&#13;
the priorities that a country assigns to various economic sectors. Additionally, an innovation&#13;
policy should also be sensitive to the environmental and social implications of innovation&#13;
and more importantly, it has to be receptive to the role that informal sector plays in&#13;
innovation.33&#13;
&#13;
23.     To start with, Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s innovation policy needs to focus on the areas of greatest&#13;
return. As has been shown from Enterprise Survey data most Pakistani firms (upwards of&#13;
95% of firms), which tend to be small, make little effort to upgrade capabilities. Changing&#13;
this behavior is a policy imperative. Three other general categories of capabilities can also be&#13;
identified: firms that willingly acquire new technologies, firms that acquire and adapt new&#13;
technologies (e.g. Coke Studio discussed earlier) and firms that carry out original R&amp;D in&#13;
their own right. While policies also are needed to help these firms, the bulk of the effort and&#13;
the big pay off will come from getting weaker firms to upgrade.&#13;
&#13;
24.     A holistic policy is required. The policy needs to include measures that (i) establish an&#13;
overarching institutional framework, (ii) strengthen the innovation ecosystem, (iii)&#13;
encourage firm-level innovation, and (iv) support knowledge provision. For Pakistan some&#13;
work has been proposed by the Planning Commission (see Box 5). While this is all helpful it&#13;
is not sufficient. It is clear the institutional side needs significant work and much more can&#13;
be done to increase firm level innovation.&#13;
&#13;
      Box 5      Measures Identified by Planning Commission&#13;
&#13;
     A number of measures have been identified by the Planning Commission of Pakistan. These are&#13;
     enumerated below:&#13;
        ï&#130;· Establish bankruptcy laws consistent with international norms&#13;
        ï&#130;· Revisit tax laws that hinder investment particularly with respect to venture capital firms&#13;
        ï&#130;· Encourage entrepreneurs to form networks of business angels&#13;
        ï&#130;· Strengthen enforcement of intellectual property and related rights&#13;
        ï&#130;· Provide effective support mechanisms (business development services) including mentoring, and&#13;
            skill building, to those who want to establish innovative ventures in a community setting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.    An overarching institutional framework is needed to drive innovation. To resolve the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;how it gets doneâ&#128;? question, international experience suggests several key actions are needed&#13;
to make this happen;&#13;
    ï&#130;· As is proposed earlier, a formal cabinet endorsed innovation policy is needed that&#13;
       builds on the significant body of existing work. Once the policy is agreed the need if&#13;
       any for enabling legislation will be determined.34&#13;

Innovation Systems: An Investment Sourcebook. World Bank. 2012.&#13;
34 Enabling legislation would be required if, for example, it was determined a new institution needed to be&#13;
&#13;
established.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        17&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Toward an Innovation Policy for Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·    A cabinet level appointment needs to be made to task the managing, monitoring and&#13;
        implementing of the policy.&#13;
   ï&#130;·    Policy implementation presents a significant coordination challenge and an&#13;
        interagency coordinating body will be needed. One measure that has worked in other&#13;
        jurisdictions is to establish MOUâ&#128;&#153;s with implementing agencies.&#13;
   ï&#130;·    Innovation needs to be emphasized at the highest levels, with an accompanying level&#13;
        of accountability. In India the President has nominated this decade as the decade of&#13;
        innovation.&#13;
   ï&#130;·    Public-private dialogue mechanisms need to be incorporated as the policy is&#13;
        developed, implemented and monitored. This mechanism would include&#13;
        Government, business and knowledge providers. A recent example in South Asia is&#13;
        Bangladesh (see Box 6) which has a broader mandate than innovation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Box 6       Bangladesh Private Sector Development Policy Coordination Committee&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) recently established a Private Sector Development (PSD) Policy&#13;
  Coordination Committee, chaired by the Principal Secretary and comprising 9 Secretaries of private sector-&#13;
  related ministries and agencies, and 3 private sector representatives. This new PSD platform has been&#13;
  established with the objective of ensuring greater coordination within the government on private sector&#13;
  development and to offer the private sector a much-needed nodal counterpart for interaction on policy and&#13;
  processes affecting the government-to-business relationships.&#13;
&#13;
  In Bangladesh there exists a multiplicity of government agencies that the private sector must deal with in&#13;
  setting up and operating its businesses; as a result, reforms of many laws, regulations, and processes&#13;
  affecting the private sector require inter-ministerial coordination. Before this committee was established,&#13;
  there was no mechanism for such coordination, which further meant that complex reforms often got stalled&#13;
  in the implementation process. It is expected that this Committee will be able to play a key role in&#13;
  implementing many such reforms in the coming years. It is mandated to make recommendations to&#13;
  improve the overall investment climate and remove constraints to business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.      The triple helix review highlights a vast range of measures that can be taken to&#13;
develop the innovation ecosystem. Clearly implementing all these measures will be too much&#13;
at once and some prioritization and sequencing will be required. The public-private dialogue&#13;
process outlined above will be a good starting point to identify priorities based on a&#13;
suggested criteria of (i) short- and long-term direct economic impact, (ii) ease of&#13;
implementation, (iii) signaling to the market that innovation is important, and (iv) potential&#13;
for spillovers.&#13;
&#13;
27.     There is a need to come up with prioritization programs that support firm-level&#13;
innovation and provide a â&#128;&#156;win-winâ&#128;? in terms of pushing innovation with its attendant&#13;
productivity benefits as well as generating jobs fairly quickly. There are three initiatives that&#13;
the triple helix analysis identified based on what has worked well in other countries that&#13;
stand out as strong candidates for Government support:&#13;
    ï&#130;· An innovation fund structured as a public-private partnership that provides matching&#13;

related to subsidy design as discussed earlier. In addition, the governance of the proposed&#13;

Innovation at firm-level: Does innovation matter for firms in Pakistan?&#13;
It is often said that innovative firms show better performance compared with non-innovative&#13;
firms which have persisted in conventional business model and not introduced new products&#13;
or services. Although this argument is widely accepted, it has not been supported by rigorous&#13;
data analysis. The World Bank Enterprise Survey conducted in Pakistan in 2007 has shed&#13;
light on this issue by providing substantial amount of data at firm level (more than 1,100&#13;
manufacturing firms were covered in this survey). According to this survey, manufacturing&#13;
firms which have introduced new products, services and business processes during the last&#13;
three fiscal years tend to demonstrate better performance compared with firms which have&#13;
not introduced such products and services for the same period.&#13;
&#13;
The regression analysis was conducted based on the survey data which covers 1,124&#13;
manufacturing firms throughout Pakistan. The log of firmâ&#128;&#153;s sales (lnsales) was set as a&#13;
dependant variable, and various independent variables (such as â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;firm sizeâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153;, â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;firm historyâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153;,&#13;
â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;location of firmsâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153;, â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;education level of top managementâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153;, â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;target marketâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;existence of&#13;
new products and business processes for the last three fiscal yearsâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153;) were created to measure&#13;
their effect on firmsâ&#128;&#153; sales records. By using log of the firmâ&#128;&#153;s sales as a dependent variable, it&#13;
is possible to estimate the effect of independent variables on dependent variable (sales) by&#13;
percentages. Because percentages are â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;units freeâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153;, it is easier to draw conclusions about&#13;
whether the size of an estimated coefficient is economically significant or not (See Table A).&#13;
&#13;
The result of the analysis was quite substantial. The regression of this model indicates that&#13;
average total annual sales of manufacturing firms which have improved products or&#13;
production processes (during the last three fiscal years) would be 32% higher than those&#13;
without these new products or processes for the same period, holding other independent&#13;
variables constant (See â&#128;&#156;IntroNewâ&#128;? variable in Table A). It suggests that average&#13;
manufacturing firms with innovation activities could generate 32% more sales than ordinary&#13;
firms which have not promoted innovation. Because absolute value of â&#128;&#156;tâ&#128;? is above 2&#13;
(|t|=2.33), the result of the regression is statistically significant (at 95% level). Although this&#13;
regression model does not exactly describe innovation itself, it could serve as a proxy to&#13;
describe and compare firm-level innovation. At the same time, it should be noted that&#13;
regression analysis only shows the correlation of the variables and not the causality between&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
This analysis demonstrates that the difference of performance between firms in Pakistan is&#13;
(partly) attributed to whether they have promoted innovation. It implies that the concept of&#13;
innovation is significantly important even in developing countries like Pakistan. It indicates&#13;
that there are considerable benefits that will arise from encouraging significantly greater&#13;
levels of innovation in Pakistani economy.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the correlation between firm-level attempt to promote innovation and their&#13;
sales record, this regression model indicates interesting implications about correlations&#13;
between firmsâ&#128;&#153; sales record and some other independent variables such as â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;location of&#13;
firmsâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153;, â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;existence of quality certificationâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#153;education level of top managementâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#153; (see&#13;
Table A). In this model, firms located in the industrial zone (or park) are likely to generate&#13;
more sales than those firms which are not located in the industrial zone. Likewise, firms with&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                20&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
internationally-recognized quality certification (such as ISO 9000 and ISO 14000) tend to&#13;
achieve more sales record compared with those without these certifications. In addition,&#13;
firms whose top management has received a higher education (especially college and&#13;
graduate level) seem to perform better compared with the firms whose top management is&#13;
less educated.&#13;
&#13;
This analysis suggests that government policies such as industrial policies, introduction of&#13;
quality control systems and development of proper education system could have a significant&#13;
impact on the improvement of sales records among firms. In other words, proper industrial&#13;
policies and the well-developed education system, coupled with the firm-level attempt to&#13;
promote innovation, could contribute to higher productivity of firms in Pakistan.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This policy paper aims to assist policy
            makers, as they develop the Pakistan Innovation Policy, with
            an independent assessment of where Pakistan stands now, an
            international perspective on policy priorities, a review of
            policy options and some implementation and institutional
            perspectives. The paper begins with a review of the key
            lessons of international experience together with a study of
            key international benchmarks. It takes a look at the
            ecosystem approach which maps the effectiveness of all the
            various players in innovation and also reviews progress
            against 12 triple helix critical success factors.  The
            possible policy options are then enumerated and evaluated
            for relevance. Finally, some perspectives are provided on
            how to move the innovation agenda forward.
