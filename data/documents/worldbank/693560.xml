Developing International Power Markets&#13;
in East Asia&#13;
Eniriqzue         The Greater Mekong subregion has good potential for international power trade. Initial interest&#13;
Crousillat        in this market is being spearheaded by private developers negotiating bilateral cross-border&#13;
trade agreements. But experience in power trade zones in Europe and North America shows that&#13;
to achieve the benefits of fully fledged trade, the countries in the subregion need to closely&#13;
coordinate electricity sector policy, operating protocols, and network development. This Note&#13;
sets out the market development options, reviews sector reforms so far, assesses the obstacles&#13;
to full power trade, and briefly outlines multilateral efforts to promote an infrastructure that will&#13;
support international power trade in the subregion.&#13;

            Developing international power markets in
            East Asia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Greater Mekong subregion--Cambodia,
            Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand,
            Vietnam, and the Yunnan Province of southern China--has good
            potential for international power trade.  Initial interest
            in this market is being spearheaded by private developers
            negotiating bilateral cross-border trade agreements.  But
            experience in power trade zones in Europe and North America
            shows that to achieve the benefits of fully fledged trade,
            the countries in the subregion need to closely coordinate
            electricity sector policy, operating protocols, and network
            development.  This Note sets out the market development
            options, reviews sector reforms so far, assesses the
            obstacles to full power trade, and briefly outlines
            multilateral efforts to promote an infrastructure that will
            support international power trade in the subregion.
