Agreement for the Electricity Support Project, dated October 8, 2013, between Burkina Faso and the&#13;
Association.&#13;
1.    The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to extend such an additional&#13;
financing, and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the additional financing are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project in support of which the proceeds of such additional&#13;
financing are to be applied continues to come within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I&#13;
of said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of&#13;
Burkina Faso and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of Burkina Faso.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project merits financial assistance from the Association,&#13;
and hereby recommends said project for such additional assistance.&#13;
