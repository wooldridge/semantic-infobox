&#13;
The case studies in this series are focused solely on what specific cities did well that&#13;
subsequently contributed to high rates of economic growth during a particular period. These&#13;
case studies should not be mistaken for investment climate reports, as the constraints, problems&#13;
and flaws of cities are not covered. Studies should also not be considered an exhaustive list of all&#13;
of the factors that contributed to growth in a city; because while some external or national level&#13;
factors are highlighted, the studies were not intended to document or list every contributing&#13;
factor. The studies focus on the local economic development actors within a city and address&#13;
what these actors did well. Particular attention was paid to initiatives that were uncommon&#13;
and/or carried out in a unique manner that could be of interest or assistance to other cities.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
This case study of the economic success of the Colombian city of Bucaramanga marks the first in&#13;
a series of World Bank case studies of successful metropolitan economies around the world. The&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive Cities Knowledge Base (CCKB) project aims to provide city leaders with&#13;
the tools and knowledge for the successful formulation and implementation of effective&#13;
economic development strategies at the city level. No single case study will provide a recipe for&#13;
success for other city leaders, but each case study in the series will offer insights and strategies&#13;
for cities faced with similar conditions, factors, and challenges. The CCKB team has conducted&#13;
one case study of an economically successful city in each world region; Bucaramanga has been&#13;
selected to represent the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region.&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga is a landlocked, mid-sized city in an upper-middle income country, still recovering&#13;
from decades of political instability and economic dislocation wrought by violence. Yet over the&#13;
past decade, Bucaramanga has had one of the best performing metropolitan economies in the&#13;
Americas in terms of GDP and employment growth, exceeding the growth of both the&#13;
Colombian economy as a whole, and that of comparable cities in its region. Its surrounding&#13;
Department of Santander is modestly endowed in natural resources, primarily oil, yet it is by no&#13;
means a petro-state with an economy reliant on extractives. Faced with the challenges of&#13;
globalization, Bucaramanga has helped its firms compete and succeed in the global marketplace,&#13;
and in the process gradually been transitioning to a post-industrial economic structure.&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga also provides an example of proactive economic development initiatives largely&#13;
led by the local private sector, but including other key participants in a citywide â&#128;&#156;growth&#13;
coalitionâ&#128;&#157;, such as local and regional government agencies, the chamber of commerce and&#13;
industry associations (sector guilds), other private-sector actors (e.g. the oil company Ecopetrol),&#13;
and representatives of academia. Understanding not just what Bucaramanga did, but more&#13;
importantly exactly how it did it, is the centerpiece of this analysis, and what makes it most&#13;
interesting to decision-makers in other cities around the world.&#13;
&#13;
This case study is based on primary and secondary research by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive Cities&#13;
Knowledge Base team, including two weeks spent in Colombia, in March and April, 2014,&#13;
interviewing government officials in the national capital, Bogota, and in Bucaramanga itself, as&#13;
well as members of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business community. The report also incorporates Bank staff&#13;
feedback received at an internal review event in Washington, DC, in June 2014.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga1 provides an example of a successful transition to a post-industrial economy&#13;
by a landlocked, mid-sized city in an upper-middle-income country, in which the private&#13;
sector has played a leading role. Bucaramanga managed to turn an existential threat â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
erosion of its traditional economic base â&#128;&#147; into an opportunity to reinvent itself, becoming a&#13;
globally-competitive city with the fastest rates of GDP and job growth in Colombia, and one of&#13;
the fastest in the Western Hemisphere. According to present growth trends, Bucaramanga may&#13;
well be on track to become a high-income metropolitan economy within the next decade.&#13;
&#13;
In the early and mid-2000s, Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economy was still heavily dependent on&#13;
traditional manufacturing industries like garments, footwear, and agricultural products,&#13;
largely made by small firms with low capital stock and limited export capabilities. While&#13;
the Colombian market remained relatively closed, such a model was viable and supported&#13;
numerous local jobs. However, with Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s accession to the WTO, Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s conclusion of&#13;
several free trade agreements with partner countries, and other market-opening measures,&#13;
Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s small firms found themselves unable to compete. While public safety and&#13;
security in Colombia were gradually improving during this period, the movement of people and&#13;
goods within the country still presented numerous challenges, not helped by the fact that there&#13;
are no railroads, or by the countryâ&#128;&#153;s famously rugged topography.&#13;
&#13;
How exactly did Bucaramanga address the acute challenges presented by globalization,&#13;
market liberalization, and ever-fiercer competition? In 2006, the Bucaramanga Chamber of&#13;
Commerce convened leaders of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s business community, academia, municipal and&#13;
departmental government, labor unions, and local officials of national agencies to discuss the&#13;
economic challenges besetting their region, and try to devise some concrete solutions. Breaking&#13;
out into multiple working groups, this forum worked to identify the regionâ&#128;&#153;s key economic and&#13;
developmental priority areas, assess the general growth potential of individual industry sectors,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  A note about geographic coverage in this report â&#128;&#147; unless otherwise specified, â&#128;&#156;Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#157; refers to the entire&#13;
Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area (Area Metropolitana de Bucaramanga â&#128;&#147; AMB), which consists of four&#13;
municipalities, each with its own mayor and local government structure: Bucaramanga, Floridablanca, Piedecusta,&#13;
and GirÃ³n. Bucaramanga is the capital of Santander Department, one of 32 in Colombia. AMB accounts for&#13;
approximately 54% of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s population, and an even higher share of its economic output, as well as 95% of&#13;
its non-oil manufacturing activity. Outside of AMB, the only other sizeable city economy in Santander is&#13;
Barrancabermeja, site of one of Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s two oil refineries and thus heavily reliant on the oil industry. Many of&#13;
the strategies and interventions analyzed in this report were undertaken at the departmental level, not the municipal&#13;
or metropolitan. Wherever an intervention was limited to only a specific municipality, this will be clearly specified&#13;
in the report.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   9&#13;
&amp;#12;discuss the institutional composition of a new Regional Competitiveness Commission (RCC, or&#13;
Santander Competitivo), and nominate prominent local individuals to serve on it.&#13;
&#13;
Once established, Santander Competitivo became the driver of proactive economic&#13;
development initiatives in the region, and the principal forum for systematic, highly&#13;
effective public-private dialogue and stakeholder engagement. With senior officials from&#13;
government, academia, and the private sector all represented on the RCC, this body had much&#13;
clout, political weight in Bogota, and ability to ensure the effective implementation of strategies,&#13;
despite having no statutory authority2, and no dedicated funding of its own. Significantly, the&#13;
RCC could rely on the support of the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce, on whose premises&#13;
it is housed, and in particular on its highly capable professional staff, in carrying out its mission.&#13;
&#13;
In consultation with various stakeholder groups, in mid-2007 the RCC prepared a Regional&#13;
Competitiveness Plan for Santander. Based on robust analytics, the plan identified industries&#13;
likely to be the drivers of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s future economic growth, and outlined specific measures&#13;
needed to aid their development. It also analyzed market trends and identified what types of&#13;
support might be needed by Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s existing industries, to help them adapt to changing&#13;
external conditions, and reorient their activities. 3 The strategic plan identified three â&#128;&#156;strategic&#13;
pillarsâ&#128;&#157; of economic development: cluster development; formalization and entrepreneurial&#13;
development; and internationalization. These pillars were supported by four cross-cutting&#13;
â&#128;&#156;strategic linesâ&#128;&#157; enabling them: infrastructure; the development of science, technology, and&#13;
innovation; metropolitan integration and strengthening; and government transparency and&#13;
efficiency. The appendices to this report provide a detailed overview of the planning process.&#13;
&#13;
Why has Bucaramanga been so successful in managing this economic transition, whereas so&#13;
many other cities have not? The following main factors of competitiveness stand out:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
  Santander was a pioneer in this respect; national legislation providing for the establishment of RCCs in all of&#13;
Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s 32 departments was subsequently enacted in part modeled on Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s experience. However, the&#13;
RCCs are not government entities, and they donâ&#128;&#153;t have large operational budgets. Santander Competitivoâ&#128;&#153;s capacity&#13;
for action and achieving meaningful results on the ground depends on its ability to influence other actors, getting&#13;
them to commit to interventions and then follow through, as well as its influence on central government actions.&#13;
3&#13;
  For example, while not all of Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s apparel industry could survive low-cost foreign competition, some&#13;
local firms were able to move higher up the value-added chain and compete on style, product differentiation, and&#13;
other factors beyond just price. Specific support measures ranged from introducing better financial management and&#13;
machinery to attending fashion shows overseas and training young fashion designers in creating innovative, unique&#13;
products.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                10&#13;
&amp;#12;1. High Levels of Human Capital: Metropolitan Bucaramanga has some of the highest&#13;
   levels of human capital in Colombia â&#128;&#147; a crucial enabler of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s ability to adapt to&#13;
   changing global conditions, and to transition into higher value-added economic activities.&#13;
   Bucaramanga has traditionally led the nation in education indicators, a fact attributable&#13;
   both to its inherited advantages, and to proactive policies to â&#128;&#156;skill upâ&#128;&#157; as a city.&#13;
&#13;
2. Highly Effective Growth Coalition: The RCCâ&#128;&#153;s effectiveness in mobilizing a broad&#13;
   growth coalition is one of the principal reasons for Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s successful transition&#13;
   into a more knowledge-intensive economy. It brings together various stakeholder groups,&#13;
   enlisting them in identifying growth constraints and regional economic development&#13;
   priorities, formulating strategies to address challenges and market opportunities,&#13;
   developing detailed plans and responsibilities for their implementation, and monitoring&#13;
   progress being made. The private sector has provided significant funding support to&#13;
   Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s economic development initiatives, and its corporate leaders have acted as the&#13;
   main champions for the region. In fact, Bucaramanga did not simply benefit from&#13;
   engagement by the private sector; it thrived because of its leadership and role in&#13;
   implementing the decisions made.&#13;
&#13;
3. Proactive Industry Targeting Based on Sound Analytics: Bucaramanga has prioritized&#13;
   certain sectors as drivers of its future economic development, employing a rigorous&#13;
   analytical process to identify industries in which it has a competitive advantage, and to&#13;
   understand the global market trends and outlook for those industries. Proactive industry&#13;
   targeting has yielded strong results: today Bucaramanga boasts young, innovative ICT&#13;
   companies, a thriving agro-industrial sector, advanced know-how in the oil and gas&#13;
   industry, increased tourist visitation, and a healthcare industry that attracts foreign&#13;
   visitors seeking medical treatment. Though still not very numerous, Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s exporters&#13;
   are succeeding in market niches like medical devices, precision mechanical parts, and&#13;
   higher value-added confectionery. Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s cluster development strategy seems to&#13;
   be yielding results, contributing substantially to job creation and retention in the city.&#13;
&#13;
4. Favorable National Economic and Policy Context: Bucaramanga has strongly&#13;
   benefitted from being part of the booming Colombian economy, increasingly open to the&#13;
   outside world (notwithstanding the competitive threats previously discussed). Dramatic&#13;
   improvements in national security and massive public investments in infrastructure have&#13;
   also been contributing factors. Significantly, Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s government provides policies&#13;
   and support tools which Bucaramanga in particular has shown much skill in utilizing;&#13;
   these include, for example, capital access programs, R&amp;D funding, technical assistance&#13;
   for company formalization, export assistance, and customized worker training programs.&#13;
&#13;
5. Natural Resource Endowment: Santander has successfully avoided the â&#128;&#156;resource&#13;
   curseâ&#128;&#157;, using its natural resource endowments to support local economic and social&#13;
   development priorities, rather than squander it on grandiose projects (monuments, white&#13;
   elephants, etc.), or by lining the pockets of a small elite. The region has clearly benefitted&#13;
   from its oil wealth, yet it is by no means a â&#128;&#156;petro-stateâ&#128;&#157;, nor can its recent economic&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;       success be primarily attributed to hydrocarbons. Oil royalties were used to support&#13;
       education, healthcare, and poverty-reduction programs, helping to build up human&#13;
       capital. The oil industry has also been a significant source of high-wage jobs, industry&#13;
       clustering, workforce skills and know-how, and technological innovation in Santander.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons for Other Cities&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga offers valuable lessons for other cities around the world seeking to grow their&#13;
economies and create jobs, the main ones being:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Mobilize economic development stakeholders into a citywide (or in this particular&#13;
      case, regional) growth coalition to work together for residentsâ&#128;&#153; shared prosperity.&#13;
      Such a coalition can but does not have to be led by the public sector â&#128;&#147; capacity to&#13;
      undertake proactive interventions can rest in various types of institutions. In&#13;
      Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s case, the growth coalition was private sector-driven, in the form of the&#13;
      Regional Competitiveness Coalition, though it included representatives of government.&#13;
      Bucaramanga demonstrates the value of building a strong growth coalition to champion&#13;
      its regionâ&#128;&#153;s economic development and interests, with businesspeople and public&#13;
      officials successfully acting in concert with other stakeholders. Beyond financial&#13;
      resources, the business community may be able to provide valuable insights into&#13;
      constraints to company formation and growth, leverage their knowledge of products and&#13;
      markets, capitalize on global ties, and exert influence on higher tiers of government to&#13;
      ensure critically important interventions like infrastructure upgrades.&#13;
&#13;
   2. In formulating a metropolitan (or regional) economic development strategy,&#13;
      prioritize among sectors to target for proactive efforts according to robust analytics&#13;
      and objective criteria, while also taking into consideration stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; input.&#13;
      Bucaramanga has avoided typical economic development pitfalls such as chasing&#13;
      industry fads, by employing an evidence-based approach to strategy development, along&#13;
      with a familiarity with global best practices (e.g. Michael Porterâ&#128;&#153;s cluster theory, etc.).&#13;
      Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s regional competitiveness plan was also successful because these data were&#13;
      used to inform discussions of regional economic priorities within the RCC, ensuring&#13;
      buy-in from key institutional actors. This helped to ensure that decisions made would&#13;
      actually be carried out, even in the absence of formal implementation mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
   3. Embrace globalization as a strategic opportunity, not a threat from which to seek&#13;
      protection. Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s prior economic structure made it highly vulnerable to low-&#13;
      cost competition. Its leaders sought to help local firms in existing industries to cope by&#13;
      innovating and competing on quality and product differentiation, rather than primarily on&#13;
      price, and to leverage existing local strengths (R&amp;D, human capital, business acumen,&#13;
      etc.) to expand into new industry segments. This approach appears to be yielding results,&#13;
      as Bucaramanga firms are becoming increasingly integrated into the global marketplace,&#13;
      while foreign companies are attracted to Santander as a suitable investment destination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              12&#13;
&amp;#12;    4. Leverage national support programs. National incentives and entrepreneurial&#13;
       assistance programs (e.g. financial, technical, information, market access, customized&#13;
       workforce training, etc.) can materially affect economic outcomes at the city level.&#13;
       Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s firms have been highly adept at taking advantage of such programs,&#13;
       aided by their Chamber of Commerce and industry associations. Santandereanos have a&#13;
       reputation nationally for being incredibly effective and timely in submitting proposals&#13;
       for grants and other support from the central government, and have in turn enjoyed&#13;
       significant support from Bogota for various economic development initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
    5. Use royalties from natural resources to strengthen public services and enable&#13;
       economic diversification, rather than just squander the proceeds. Santander has used&#13;
       its oil revenues to bolster education, public health, and reduce poverty, instead of&#13;
       building mega-monuments or flagship facilities, or losing the funds to corruption. Far&#13;
       from turning Santander into a petro-state, hydrocarbons have helped the development of&#13;
       innovative technologies, companies, and know-how directly benefiting economic growth&#13;
       and diversification, while also alleviating pressure on public finances. The typical&#13;
       pitfalls were avoided through a combination of increased transparency, an improving&#13;
       security situation in Colombia, public â&#128;&#156;watchdogâ&#128;&#157; activities by the Chamber and other&#13;
       actors, and closer scrutiny and demands by the departmentâ&#128;&#153;s citizenry at large.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National Context&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s growth has occurred in a highly favorable, and improving, national policy&#13;
and macroeconomic context. Colombia has made major strides in the early 21st century,&#13;
maintaining macroeconomic and monetary stability, prudent fiscal policies, low inflation, and&#13;
steady exchange rates, and weathering the global recession in 2008-2009 without a single year of&#13;
negative GDP growth. A comparatively young, highly urbanized society of nearly 50 million&#13;
consumers, the country has been opening its economy up to the outside world, enjoying much&#13;
success at attracting foreign investors and increasing its exports. Unemployment and poverty&#13;
rates have fallen substantially, though more than a third of all Colombians (37.2%)4 remain poor.&#13;
&#13;
The nationâ&#128;&#153;s unique geography and traditions have resulted in decentralized decision-&#13;
making structures and fiscal mechanisms. Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s rugged topography has fostered the&#13;
emergence of distinctive regional cultures and economies, and the central government has&#13;
traditionally had a less prominent role than in many countries of a comparable size and level of&#13;

&amp;#12;in Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s individual cities and regions, local authorities and businesses often had to seek&#13;
local solutions to various challenges, including economic development.&#13;
&#13;
Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s institutional framework reflects the reality of a decentralized, unitary republic.&#13;
Key measures bringing local decision-making closer to the citizen include:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Since the passage of national legislation in 1988, mayors have been elected by popular&#13;
        vote (rather than appointed), improving accountability and local governance;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s 1991 constitution substantially decentralized the country, devolving&#13;
        significant responsibilities and fiscal authority to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s 32 departments. Some&#13;
        45% of annual central government revenues are transferred to subnational governments&#13;
        through the Sistema General de Participaciones (SGP)5, which allocates funds for the&#13;
        provision of basic public services like education, health, potable water, and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Dismantling barriers to trade and fostering economic growth has been a priority for&#13;
national policymakers, but in practice the need to improve security and ensure financial&#13;
stability took precedence. Constitutional and legislative reforms in the 1990s were&#13;
accompanied by a gradual liberalization of the economy. At the time, key industries like apparel&#13;
and agribusiness were still heavily protected by trade barriers, and generally not globally&#13;
competitive. It was apparent that market liberalization would have to be accompanied by a&#13;
modernization of Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic base. However, severe internal security challenges and&#13;
high levels of violence meant that restoring peace remained the top policy priority in the 1990s&#13;
and early 2000s. Moreover, like other Latin American countries, Colombia was adversely&#13;
affected by the 1998 financial crisis. Although the crisis was less severe in Colombia, it still led&#13;
to an economic contraction in 1999. The crisis diverted the attention of national agencies, and&#13;
limited the availability of funds for strategic initiatives designed to boost competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
As the internal security and financial situation in the country gradually improved, there&#13;
was a renewed focus on market liberalization and strengthening economic competitiveness.&#13;
Colombia has been a strong proponent of free trade agreements, successfully negotiating a range&#13;
of bilateral trade and investment treaties with key global trading partners. Colombia has also&#13;
made significant strides in improving its investment climate by relaxing rules on foreign direct&#13;
investment, establishing investment â&#128;&#156;one stop shopsâ&#128;&#157;, and working to address constraints like&#13;
inadequate infrastructure and workforce skills. In parallel, the government has dismantled&#13;
entrenched monopolies, like the state-owned oil company Ecopetrol (which still has a large&#13;
presence in Santander Department) and opened up the countryâ&#128;&#153;s telecommunications sector to&#13;

&amp;#12;competition, resulting in the emergence of multiple providers.6 These changes have had results:&#13;
by 2013, FDI inflows reached $16.7 billion7, not just into the extractives industry, but also in&#13;
sectors such as banking, power generation, telecommunications, retail, and transportation.&#13;
&#13;
Recognizing the ability of Colombian firms to compete in the global marketplace as vitally&#13;
important, Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s government began to establish the foundation for a unified national&#13;
system of economic competitiveness in 2006. The competitiveness and innovation framework&#13;
formalized the division of economic development responsibilities. At the national level, the focus&#13;
was on national security, market liberalization, fiscal stability, improving the business climate,&#13;
and identification of priority â&#128;&#156;productive sectorsâ&#128;&#157; nationwide. National programs were put in&#13;
place to support the growth of these priority sectors, while regional governments could apply for&#13;
central government funding to support specific initiatives furthering these sectorsâ&#128;&#153; development.&#13;
&#13;
Today, individual national government agencies are tasked with administering specific&#13;
programs designed to strengthen the competitiveness of the Colombian economy. While&#13;
each agency has a clear mandate and role in some aspect of economic development, there are&#13;
inevitably some overlaps in their responsibilities. A detailed list of the national agencies and&#13;
their specific responsibilities is provided in the appendices to this report.&#13;
&#13;
To further operationalize the national competitiveness agenda, in 2007 Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
government enacted legislation enabling the establishment of Regional Competitiveness&#13;
Commissions (RCCs) in each of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s 32 departments. Designed to foster public-&#13;
private dialogue and stakeholder engagement, the RCCs were to include representatives from&#13;
governments, universities, and private-sector organizations like chambers of commerce. The&#13;
RCCs were tasked with creating regional competitiveness plans which would complement the&#13;
national competitiveness plan, including the use of support tools provided by the central&#13;
government. As part of the planning process, each RCC was made responsible for identifying its&#13;
own issues and development priorities, as well as specific steps needed to achieve them. Among&#13;
all 32 departments in Colombia, Santander is widely recognized as having one of the most&#13;
successful RCCs, both in terms of planning, and in the implementation of plans developed.&#13;

improved security and public safety in the country.&#13;

&amp;#12;Local Context&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
History&#13;
&#13;
Path dependency has been an important enabler of Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s recent economic&#13;
success, as evidenced by its comparatively high human development indicators, low levels&#13;
of inequality, high quality of life, educational attainment levels, and entrepreneurial&#13;
traditions. Bucaramanga is a mid-sized city located in Santander Department, a hilly agricultural&#13;
region between Bogota, the Caribbean Coast, and Venezuela. It was chosen by colonists for&#13;
settlement in 1622, and developed a middle class of merchants early on. The regionâ&#128;&#153;s economy&#13;
was initially based on smallholder farming and cattle ranching, so the region never developed the&#13;
kind of inequality inherent to plantation-style farming along Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s Caribbean coast.&#13;
&#13;
In the 20th century, two significant local industries emerged in Santander: the oil industry&#13;
in Barrancabermeja, and the textile and garment industry in Bucaramanga. Under&#13;
Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s protectionist policies at the time, the textile and footwear industries flourished in a&#13;
closed market. Production initially consisted of simple knitting and assembly, but local firms&#13;
were forced to innovate as early as the 1970s due to fierce competitive pressures from Medellin,&#13;
the national leader in garment manufacturing, whose firms disproportionately benefitted from&#13;
Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s protectionist measures8.&#13;
&#13;
One of the most transformative events came in 1948, with the establishment of the&#13;
Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), an institution benefiting from a large influx of&#13;
academics who had fled Europe during WWII. While many other Colombian cities established&#13;
public universities, UIS stood apart because of the high quality of its curricula in engineering,&#13;
science, and technology in particular, developed to support the national oil company, Ecopetrol,&#13;
and its nearby refinery in Barrancabermeja.&#13;
&#13;
Improved public service provision in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in an improving quality&#13;
of life for Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s residents. For example, Santander was one of the first regions to&#13;
provide clean water to most of its population. The provision of quality public services, temperate&#13;
climate, and relatively favorable security environment in Bucaramanga attracted new&#13;
households, as workers from the refinery in Barrancabermeja frequently chose to settle their&#13;
families in nearby Bucaramanga.&#13;

                                                                                                                     16&#13;
&amp;#12;Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s traditional economic structure, based on small-scale manufacturing, was&#13;
ill-suited to an increasingly globalized economy. Successive attempts to adapt to changing&#13;
circumstances in the 1990s generally failed to yield the desired results. Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economy was adversely affected by the gradual opening up of the Colombian economy starting&#13;
in the 1990s, as its traditional industries lost market share to global competition. With a&#13;
disproportionate share of small and micro enterprises, Bucaramanga had few large companies&#13;
outside the oil industry capable of exporting. The few goods to be exported by its small firms,&#13;
competing largely on price, were largely destined for the neighboring Venezuelan market.&#13;
&#13;
With economic conditions worsening in the 1990s, the public and private sectors began,&#13;
both individually and jointly, to focus on Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s economic competitiveness. Early&#13;
discussions centered on struggling traditional sectors, and the need to further develop more&#13;
competitive industries. Plans, such as the â&#128;&#156;Metropolitan Tecnopolisâ&#128;&#157;, were formulated to foster&#13;
the development of science and technology through educational programs, technology parks, and&#13;
innovation labs. However, these strategies lacked long-term champions, concrete implementation&#13;
plans, and the funding necessary to carry them to fruition. While these early efforts would&#13;
influence future regional strategies, most actors in Bucaramanga concede that substantive,&#13;
effective collaboration on economic development did not begin until the new millennium.&#13;
&#13;
The start of the 21st century saw positive developments at the national level, and more&#13;
productive collaboration among key local actors. Collaboration in Bucaramanga increased&#13;
between the public sector, private sector, and academia; but unlike in the previous decade, this&#13;
time the collaboration was more fruitful. Institutions9 were crafted to formalize cross-sector&#13;
engagement, and strategic approaches to local economic development were paired with concrete&#13;
implementation plans and funding sources, improving the likelihood of long-term success.&#13;
&#13;
Despite improved collaboration, one external developmentâ&#128;&#147; deteriorating relations with&#13;
neighboring Venezuela â&#128;&#147; had a particularly detrimental effect on Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economy.&#13;
When political relations between Colombia and Venezuela soured, and the late President Hugo&#13;
Chavez restricted market access for Colombian-made goods in 2008, many of Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
  One such new institution was Metropolitan ADEL. In 1999, the Metropolitan Corporation of Planning and&#13;
Development of Bucaramanga (CORPLAN) was established to promote public- private sector engagement on local&#13;
economic and social development issues. Led by the Mayor of Bucaramanga, CORPLAN included the mayors of&#13;
nearby municipalities, the Chamber of Commerce, and university and industry groups. In 2000, CORPLAN wrote&#13;
the regionâ&#128;&#153;s first cross-sector collaborative strategic plan, Vision 2015. This plan would later influence and provide&#13;
a â&#128;&#156;head startâ&#128;&#157; to the creation of the first regional competitiveness plan by the RCC (Santander Competitivo).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  17&#13;
&amp;#12;small manufacturers were irreparably hurt. They had become strongly dependent on exporting to&#13;
nearby Venezuela, and with access restricted, SMEs had to learn to identify export opportunities&#13;
in other markets, in addition to trying to cope with increased global competition.&#13;
&#13;
The past few years have seen a gradual, successful transformation of Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economic structure. Innovation and increased productivity in existing sectors, along with a&#13;
conscious shift towards new industries, has picked up pace in recent years. A small cluster of&#13;
high-wage ICT companies began to develop, alongside growth in BPO and knowledge services,&#13;
hydrocarbons, medical tourism (FundaciÃ³n Cardiovascular de Colombia- FCV10), and adventure&#13;
tourism. As Bucaramanga began to adapt and develop new industries, the service sector replaced&#13;
manufacturing as its largest sector, accounting for 37.9% of local GDP in 2011.11&#13;
&#13;
Key Local Actors&#13;
&#13;
Department of Santander&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga is the capital of the Department of Santander, one of 32 administrative units&#13;
into which Colombia is subdivided. With a surface area of 30,000 km2 and a population of 2.1&#13;
million, Santander is a mountainous region endowed with hydrocarbons and abundant water&#13;
resources. Besides the Bucaramanga Metropolitan area, the only other sizeable city in the&#13;
department is Barrancabermeja, on the Magdalena River, best known as the site of one of&#13;
Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s two oil refineries. Santander is governed by a Departmental Assembly and a&#13;
Governor, who is popularly elected by constituents for a single, four-year term.&#13;
&#13;
The devolution of power from Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s central government since the early 1990s has&#13;
resulted in the accumulation of significant administrative scope at the departmental level.&#13;
Funding for departmental programs comes from levying local taxes, national government&#13;
transfers, and oil royalties.12 Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s departments have significant discretionary authority&#13;
over spending decisions; however some national funds are specifically earmarked for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   In the early 1990s, Dr. Victor Raul Castillo and Dr. Franklin Roberto Quiroz established a non-profit medical&#13;
research center to treat and prevent heart disease. With an excellent cardiovascular surgery program (performing the&#13;
first open-heart surgery in Colombia), FCV is recognized as one of the top ten research centers in Colombia. FCV&#13;
has both a corporate university training program and independent air transportation service. FCV is currently&#13;
building a new International Hospital within the Health Free Trade Zone in Santander.&#13;

Republica, January 2013. www.banrep.gov.co/sites/default/files/publicaciones/archivos/dtser_180.pdf&#13;
12&#13;
   Since 2011, oil royalties (regalias) have been distributed among Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s 32 departments according to a new&#13;
formula. This has resulted in Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s share being cut in half, from 6.5% to 3.2% of the national total.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 18&#13;
&amp;#12;investments in health, education, and other priorities. There is a dedicated planning unit within&#13;
the government of Santander, which prepares a long-term regional development plan outlining&#13;
key infrastructure investments and projects of regional significance. However, Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
government does not have statutory responsibility for, or engage in, â&#128;&#156;coreâ&#128;&#157; economic&#13;
development activities such as investment attraction, sector targeting, or industry-specific&#13;
support programs. Instead, the departmental government focuses on creating a general enabling&#13;
environment in which economic development can take place, and supports other institutional&#13;
actors.&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area and Its Municipalities&#13;
&#13;
The Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area (AMB) accounts for approximately 54% of&#13;
Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s population (1.1 million people), and an even higher share of its economic output,&#13;
including nearly 95% of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s non-oil manufacturing activity. AMB is made up of four&#13;
individual municipalities, each with its own popularly-elected Mayor: Bucaramanga (with about&#13;
half the AMBâ&#128;&#153;s population), Floridablanca, Piedecusta, and GirÃ³n. The Bucaramanga&#13;
Metropolitan Area has a coordinating body with a small professional staff, responsible for&#13;
ensuring integrated metropolitan development and coordination for projects of area-wide&#13;
significance, such as transport and mobility, water supply and sewerage, housing, environmental&#13;
sustainability, and select other public services. The AMB coordinating bodyâ&#128;&#153;s direct&#13;
responsibilities do not include economic development, but they do enable it. The four individual&#13;
municipalities focus on addressing select local economic issues, such as targeted assistance to&#13;
low-income and vulnerable groups. Their involvement in proactive economic development is&#13;
mostly indirect, through their participation in the RCC.&#13;
&#13;
Regional Competitiveness Commission (Santander Competitivo)&#13;
&#13;
Santander Competitivo is the creator of the departmental strategic plan for economic&#13;
development, and the principal convening body for all entities involved in its formulation&#13;
and implementation. Although established in accordance with national law, the RCC has little&#13;
in the way of formal statutory authority or funding, instead relying on the relationship capital and&#13;
prestige of its leadership to enact meaningful interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s RCC was the first to be established in Colombia, and is still one of the most&#13;
successful. Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to establish a regional competitiveness agenda actually&#13;
preceded the national legislation enabling the formation of the RCCs (see sidebar), and served as&#13;
a national model.&#13;
&#13;
Along with the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce, on whose premises it is housed, the&#13;
RCC is the principal conduit for public-private dialogue in the region. In addition to input&#13;
                                                                                          19&#13;
&amp;#12;from stakeholders, its strategy is developed based on sound analytics. Santander&#13;
Competitivo was set up to promote engagement and collaboration between public institutions,&#13;
academia, the private sector, and civil society, with the goal of improving public policy,&#13;
developing sector diagnostics, and formulating a regional competitiveness plan. The Commission&#13;
employed analytical tools like cluster mapping to prioritize among sectors to support, ultimately&#13;
choosing health, oil and gas, and tourism as the top three sectors with the most development&#13;
potential.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Creation of Santander Competitivo&#13;
&#13;
 Seeking to address regional economic challenges, in August 2006 the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce&#13;
 convened some 70-80 leaders of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s business community, academia, municipal and departmental&#13;
 government, labor unions, and local officials of national agencies. Breaking out into 3-4 working groups/ work-&#13;
 shops, this seminal gathering (later named the â&#128;&#156;Regional Competitiveness Forumâ&#128;&#157;) sought to identify the regionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 key economic and developmental priority areas, assess the general growth potential of individual industry sectors,&#13;
 discuss the institutional composition of a new RCC, and nominate prominent individuals to serve on it.&#13;
 Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s new commission gradually began to take shape, practically simultaneously with the development of a&#13;
 national framework for regional economic competitiveness. In February 2007, before the RCCs were established in&#13;
 the departments, the new commission was formalized by a voluntary agreement under the name of Santander&#13;
 Competitivo. As there was no dedicated funding for the development of the RCCs, the Bucaramanga Chamber of&#13;
 Commerce offered its assistance, and Santander Competitivo was established in the Chamberâ&#128;&#153;s office space. Martha&#13;
 Pinto de Hart, a former Minister of Telecommunications in the first Uribe government (2002-06), had recently&#13;
 returned to her native Bucaramanga and was unanimously selected to be the new organizationâ&#128;&#153;s first Executive&#13;
 Director, agreeing to serve without compensation.&#13;
 Non-governmental entities made up more than three quarters of the commission. Consisting of 30 members, the&#13;
 commission included:&#13;
 â&#128;¢   From the public sector:&#13;
         o The Governor of Santander&#13;
         o President of the departmental legislature&#13;
         o President of the Bucaramanga city council&#13;
         o 3 City Mayors (Bucaramanga, Barrancabermeja, San Gil)&#13;
         o Regional Director of workforce agency SENA&#13;
 â&#128;¢   From civil society (or non-governmental entities):&#13;
         o 13 businesspeople nominated by the Bucaramanga and Barrancabermeja Chambers of Commerce&#13;
         o 3 representatives of industry guilds&#13;
         o 3 members of academia&#13;
         o 1 representative from the labor union&#13;
         o 1 representative from the Santander Science &amp; Technology Council,&#13;
         o 1 representative from Ecopetrol&#13;
         o 1 representative from the local development agency Adel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                      20&#13;
&amp;#12;Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s draft Regional Competitive-ness Plan was completed by August 2007.&#13;
Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s was the first RCC to develop a plan, and discussed it with stakeholders from both&#13;
government and civil society. The planâ&#128;&#153;s main vision was articulated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;&#156;In 2032, Santander will be one of Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s three most competitive departments, with&#13;
       a high quality of life and the highest per capita income in the country, thanks to the&#13;
       dynamism of its economy achieved through its productive sectors, producing innovative&#13;
       high value-added goods and services while respecting the environment, with a business&#13;
       climate conducive to local and foreign investment, while encouraging the regionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       comprehensive and equitable development.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
The strategic plan was a comprehensive, but also a living document periodically updated.&#13;
In order to achieve its goal of becoming the third most competitive department in the country by&#13;
2032, three â&#128;&#156;strategic pillarsâ&#128;&#157; were identified to drive economic development: cluster&#13;
development; formalization and entrepreneurial development; and internationalization. These&#13;
pillars were supported by four cross-cutting â&#128;&#156;strategic linesâ&#128;&#157; enabling them: infrastructure; the&#13;
development of science, technology, and innovation; metropolitan integration and strengthening;&#13;
and government transparency and efficiency. Progress was systematically tracked on an ongoing&#13;
basis, and stakeholders materially involved in its implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce is the metropolitan areaâ&#128;&#153;s principal private-&#13;
sector champion of economic development. In Colombia, chambers of commerce play a semi-&#13;
official role, performing select public functions while also acting as private membership&#13;
organizations. The Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce was established in 1915 in accordance&#13;
with national law, to maintain a registry of local firms on behalf of the national government.&#13;
Since then, the Chamber has taken on a number of other roles and responsibilities, including:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Providing fee-based business services to private-sector firms, including market&#13;
       intelligence, entrepreneurship and management training, and technical advice.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Serving as the advocate and organizing lead on a number of cross-cutting issues affecting&#13;
       the private sector, both locally and in the national capital, Bogota.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Providing public oversight of municipal finances and government contracting processes.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Developing its own in-house investment promotion agency, named Invest in Santander,&#13;
       as the central marketing, recruiting, and site-selection service provider in the region.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   In close collaboration with ProExport Colombia, providing export information and local&#13;
       product/service promotion, helping to organize and partly subsidize company attendance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              21&#13;
&amp;#12;       at industry events abroad, staging conferences and exhibition fairs, and bringing guest&#13;
       speakers to Bucaramanga. Tellingly, the Chamberâ&#128;&#153;s motto is Â¡Vamos a competir!&#13;
&#13;
In the 21st century, the Chamber has been a leader of public and private sector engagement&#13;
on local competitiveness issues in Bucaramanga and Santander. In 2004, the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce did a study on transportation and connectivity. In this study, access to markets was&#13;
identified as a key competitive constraint, highlighting a clear need for increased investment in&#13;
the sector. Since large infrastructure projects are the central governmentâ&#128;&#153;s responsibility, the&#13;
Chamber lobbied based on the results of their study, putting pressure on national decision makers&#13;
and ultimately getting new infrastructure investments in their region (e.g. Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s new&#13;
Palo Negro airport, ongoing construction of the Ruta del Sol highway through Santander, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
In 2008, the Chamber created a dedicated business development unit to provide&#13;
entrepreneurial assistance services to local firms. In line with the national Rutas Competitivas&#13;
program and Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s own Regional Competitiveness Plan, the Chamber identifies high-&#13;
imapct sectors to support, then outlines steps needed to make local firms globally competitive in&#13;
those industries. Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s Chamber is one of few in Colombia to employ hard data and&#13;
very rigorous analysis to identify the highest value-added activities and market opportunities. For&#13;
example, the Chamber has identified health, education, and transport as key enabling factors for&#13;
improving productivity, as well as infrastructure and English skills as two cross-cutting themes.&#13;
&#13;
The Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce is primarily funded by private resources, with&#13;
some support from the national government. The Chamber continues to receive administrative&#13;
fees from registering new firms, but has in recent years managed to triple its income by&#13;
providing additional high-value business services to members. A key enabler of the Chamberâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
success has been its immense institutional capacity, relying on a highly capable, dedicated staff.&#13;
&#13;
Universities and Research Institutions&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga is one of Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s foremost educational centers, with academic&#13;
institutions especially renowned for their applied research and technology. The Santander&#13;
Department is home to 15 institutions of higher learning, 12 of which are located in metropolitan&#13;
Bucaramanga itself, and one each in Barrancabermeja, San Gil, and Socorro. With a reputation&#13;
as a â&#128;&#156;university townâ&#128;&#157;, Bucaramanga attracts students from all over Colombia and abroad.&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s universities and research institutions have actively promoted the&#13;
development of high technology sectors, for which they are sometimes paid by national&#13;
government agencies (through approved RCC proposals), or compensated by private businesses&#13;
for their services. Examples of their involvement in economic development activities include:&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                22&#13;
&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   Ecopetrol designed courses at UIS and UNAB to improve local human capital&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Universities regularly partnered with SENA to improve worker training programs,&#13;
       including building accredited courses to train machinery operators&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Provided custom research for the oil industry, cacao industry, and agro-industry&#13;
   â&#128;¢   University support for dedicated research centers in petroleum and derivatives&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Biomedical research for FundaciÃ³n Cardiovascular&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Provided support tools for businesses, and services for the Chamber of Commerce&#13;
   â&#128;¢   San Tomas partnered with ProExport Colombia to provide technical assistance to firms&#13;
       interested in exporting, but still lacking the technical capacity or market know-how&#13;
&#13;
Established in 1948, Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS) is Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s flagship&#13;
educational institution and a key player in regional economic development. For decades,&#13;
UIS has been working with government agencies, the Chamber, and directly with for-profit&#13;
businesses on competitiveness issues, especially in the areas of innovation and technology&#13;
commercialization. It has enjoyed close research links to the hydrocarbons industry, but in recent&#13;
years has also developed research excellence in a number of other, non-traditional areas. UIS&#13;
plays a role in Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s economy both through the development of technologies (which may&#13;
find acceptance in the marketplace), and the formation of new workforce talent.&#13;
&#13;
The Colombian Petroleum Institute (ICP) is the largest research institution in Santander,&#13;
and for decades has a played an important role in the regionâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. ICP&#13;
is the research branch of the oil firm (and former state monopoly) Ecopetrol, and was the only&#13;
such research center in Colombia as early as the 1970s. ICP has a strategic vision in sync with&#13;
Ecopetrolâ&#128;&#153;s: to develop scientific potential aligned with business needs, and enable commercial&#13;
applications of its technologies. Ecopetrol receives R&amp;D tax credits, funded by Colciencias.&#13;
&#13;
Guatiguara is Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s technology park, which today plays a leading role in applied&#13;
research and technology commercialization. UIS originally developed the park in&#13;
collaboration with Ecopetrol, receiving some funding from oil royalties, as well as resources&#13;
from national agencies (Colciencias) and other private-sector sources like CETICS, ICP, and&#13;
FCV. The park formally opened in 2011 as one of only two in Colombia; by 2014 it already&#13;
employed 240 people providing contract research services, including to firms in other countries.&#13;
UIS conducts much of its research at Guatiguara, and encourages corporations to co-locate there.&#13;

&amp;#12;Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Factors of Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the Executive Summary, Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economic success cannot be attributed to&#13;
any single factor, but to a combination of them. The principal ones are listed below.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 1: High Levels of Human Capital&#13;
&#13;
Metropolitan Bucaramanga has some of the highest levels of human capital in Colombia â&#128;&#147;&#13;
a crucial enabler of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s ability to adapt to changing global conditions, and transition&#13;
into higher value-added economic activities. Bucaramanga has traditionally led the nation&#13;
across a range of quantifiable education indicators (number and quality of institutions, curricula,&#13;
student enrollment, graduation rates, general literacy levels), as the combined result of inherited&#13;
advantages and proactive policies to â&#128;&#156;skill upâ&#128;&#157; in order to boost its economic competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s exceptionally high levels of human capital are, inter alia, attributable to the&#13;
following:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Adequate funding for education at all levels, in part funded by natural resource royalties,&#13;
       but strongly supported by both the public and private sectors.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ High-quality curricula at local institutions, with a strong focus on engineering (about a&#13;
       third of all graduates) and other applied fields like medicine, business, finance,&#13;
       accounting, and design (most others).&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Entrepreneurial capacity of local firms, including general business know-how, a&#13;
       knowledge of products and markets, and a commitment to constant innovation and&#13;
       adaptation.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Knowledge spillovers from existing clusters of expertise into related fields, e.g. UISâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       initial training of engineers for the oil industry, who later diversified into new areas.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Talent attraction (of students and working professionals) from all over the country, and&#13;
       from abroad, including the Colombian diaspora and entrepreneurs leaving Venezuela.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Successful utilization of national support tools and workforce development programs,&#13;
       usually in partnership with the local office of the National Learning Service (SENA).&#13;
       This includes highly effective customized worker training programs, responsive to&#13;
       employersâ&#128;&#153; immediate needs.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ A longstanding local tradition and commitment to prioritizing education, and ensuring&#13;
       universal access to educational opportunities, even for the most disadvantaged segments&#13;
       of society (the extremely poor, disabled, internally displaced persons, and so on).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                25&#13;
&amp;#12;Factor 2: Highly Effective Growth Coalition&#13;
&#13;
Proactive economic development initiatives in Bucaramanga were led by the private sector,&#13;
with support from national and local government agencies. The city and its surrounding&#13;
region did not simply benefit from engagement by the private sector; it thrived because of its&#13;
leadership. In Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s decentralized system, the national government provides a general&#13;
framework for regional economic competitiveness, along with some support tools like funding,&#13;
training, and technical assistance programs; the rest is the responsibility of the regions&#13;
themselves. Governments at the departmental and municipal level largely focus on the provision&#13;
of enabling infrastructure like transportation and utilities, and are also represented on the&#13;
Regional Competitiveness Commission in a consultative capacity. But proactive economic&#13;
development efforts are led by private-sector actors, both within the framework of the RCC and&#13;
through other, parallel tracks, such as the activities of the Chamber of Commerce.&#13;
&#13;
The principal forum for public-private dialogue and stakeholder engagement in Santander&#13;
is the Regional Competitiveness Commission; its effectiveness may be one of the principal&#13;
reasons for Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s successful transition into a more knowledge-intensive economy.&#13;
The RCC brings together representatives of various government entities, as well as local&#13;
universities, the two chambers of commerce (Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s, along with the much smaller one&#13;
from Barrancabermeja), industry associations (guilds), and other stakeholder groups from the&#13;
private sector and civil society at large. Through a structured, comprehensive process, the RCC&#13;
engages stakeholders in identifying growth constraints and regional economic development&#13;
priorities, formulates strategies to address challenges and market opportunities, develops detailed&#13;
plans assigning specific responsibilities for their implementation, and monitors progress being&#13;
achieved towards set goals.&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga did not just involve diverse stakeholder groups in formulating economic&#13;
development plans, it actually relied on them to implement the majority of interventions.&#13;
Private sector actors have provided significant funding support to Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
development initiatives, and its corporate leaders have acted as the main champions for the&#13;
region. The implementation of specific items in the strategic plan was assigned to dedicated task&#13;
teams, made up of staff from the RCC, Chamber of Commerce, government agencies (national&#13;
and/or local), universities, individual members of the business community, and various other&#13;
stakeholders. Stakeholders used their capacity, resources, and relationship capital to advance the&#13;
regionâ&#128;&#153;s economic development priorities, and played a very active role in strategy formulation&#13;
and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                26&#13;
&amp;#12;Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s growth coalition does not have any dedicated funding, statutory authority, or&#13;
means of compelling entities or individuals to honor commitments made through the&#13;
strategic planning process. Although established in accordance with national legislation, the&#13;
RCC has no dedicated sources of funding, and only a very small professional staff, co-located on&#13;
the premises of the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce. Within the RCC, there are no formal&#13;
mechanisms to ensure strategy implementation and follow-through on commitments, and no&#13;
incentives or penalties for participants in the process â&#128;&#147; although RCC and Chamber staff do&#13;
monitor progress on an ongoing basis. Inter-institutional cooperation and implementation are&#13;
facilitated by the fact that Bucaramanga is a mid-sized city, in which key public and private-&#13;
sector officials know each other, cross paths on an almost daily basis, and thus enjoy a web of&#13;
strong informal relationships. Peer pressure and reputations within the local community are&#13;
sometimes more effective than formal provisions in ensuring adherence to what has been agreed.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 3: Proactive Industry Targeting Based on Sound Analytics&#13;
&#13;
Faced with the erosion of its traditional economic base, Bucaramanga has proactively&#13;
worked towards laying the foundations of its â&#128;&#156;next economyâ&#128;&#157;, by prioritizing certain&#13;
sectors as drivers of economic development. This has entailed employing a rigorous analytical&#13;
process to identify industries in which Santander has a competitive advantage, and to understand&#13;
the global market trends and outlook for those industries. The RCC and its partners set about&#13;
developing a strategic plan to aid these industriesâ&#128;&#153; growth locally, outlining specific steps,&#13;
timelines, and institutional responsibilities for their implementation. On an ongoing basis,&#13;
researchers at the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce monitor the progress made in each&#13;
targeted cluster, and feed the results into new public policy formulation (shared with local&#13;
government) and goal setting for the strategic planâ&#128;&#153;s subsequent revisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Proactive industry targeting has yielded some impressive results: today Bucaramanga is&#13;
home to young, innovative ICT companies, a thriving agro-industrial sector, advanced know-&#13;
how in the oil and gas industry, numerous new (and well-visited) tourist facilities, and a&#13;
healthcare industry that attracts visitors seeking treatment from all over Latin America and the&#13;
Caribbean. Although still not very numerous, Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s exporters are succeeding in market&#13;
niches like medical devices, precision mechanical parts, and higher value-added confectionery â&#128;&#147;&#13;
in markets beyond just neighboring Venezuela. In short, Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s cluster development&#13;
strategy seems to be working, and can be credited for at least a portion of the 85,000 new jobs&#13;
created locally in the four-year period from 2008 to 2012.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             27&#13;
&amp;#12;Factor 4: A Favorable National Economic Context&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economy has been helped by the fact that Colombia as a whole has been&#13;
booming economically for a number of years. Bucaramanga is not a city that has done well&#13;
in spite of the national economy to which it belongs; being part of Colombia has&#13;
contributed its success. One of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s better-performing economies, Colombia weathered&#13;
the global recession of 2008-09 without a single year of negative GDP growth, and annual GDP&#13;
growth has remained above 4% since then. Unemployment is falling, poverty levels have&#13;
declined sharply, and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s mineral wealth and rapidly growing middle class appeal to&#13;
international firms. Bucaramanga has benefitted from being part of the broader Colombian&#13;
economy in the following specific ways:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   A favorable national policy framework. Colombian policies are pro-market and pro-&#13;
       growth, with a commitment to monetary stability, competitiveness, and globalization.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Improved national security: The security situation nationwide has improved dramatically&#13;
       in the past few years. While sporadic incidents of violence do occur, they are no longer of&#13;
       a magnitude and frequency to substantially deter economic activity around the country. In&#13;
       turn, Santander is considered safer than most other parts of the country.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Specific policy tools at the citiesâ&#128;&#153; and regionsâ&#128;&#153; disposal, funded by the national&#13;
       government. These include everything from funding R&amp;D projects at universities and&#13;
       technical assistance for company formalization, to customized worker training programs&#13;
       and export assistance. Bucaramanga has been relatively more successful at tapping into&#13;
       these sources of national government support than many other Colombian metros.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Massive public investment in infrastructure, including construction of the Ruta del Sol&#13;
       highway linking Bogota with the Caribbean coast via Santander, expansion of the river&#13;
       port at Barrancabermeja and navigation along the Magdalena River, and a possible future&#13;
       rail link. In addition to creating construction jobs locally, this is lowering transport costs&#13;
       to market for Bucaramanga companies.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   A rapidly-growing domestic market, with an expanding middle class, falling poverty&#13;
       rates, and increased demand for non-traditional products from Santander, such as poultry.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   More liberal trade and investment with various countries around the world, as a result of&#13;
       bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements and other market-opening initiatives&#13;
       supported by the Colombian government.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 5: Natural Resource Endowment&#13;
&#13;
Santander provides an example of a region successfully avoiding the â&#128;&#156;resource curseâ&#128;&#157;,&#13;
using oil royalties to support economic and social development priorities, rather than&#13;
squander it on grandiose projects (monuments, white elephants, etc.), or by lining the pockets of&#13;
a small elite. While it has clearly benefitted from its endowments, Santander is by no means a&#13;
â&#128;&#156;petro-stateâ&#128;&#157;, nor can its economic success be primarily attributed to hydrocarbons. Oil revenues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  28&#13;
&amp;#12;were used to support education, healthcare, and poverty-reduction programs, resulting in the&#13;
highest levels of human capital and the lowest poverty rates of any metro area in Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
The main specific ways in which natural resource wealth has aided Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
development include:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Employment: Historically, the oil refinery in Barrancabermeja has supported stable,&#13;
         relatively high-wage jobs for the regionâ&#128;&#153;s residents, as well as professionals from other&#13;
         regions. This has supported incomes and consumption throughout the region.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Skills: The oil industryâ&#128;&#153;s need for engineering talent has led to the establishment of high-&#13;
         quality educational programs at local institutions, in particular UIS, and the emergence of&#13;
         a more diversified skills base growing out of the oil industryâ&#128;&#153;s needs.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Industry clustering: Over several decades, numerous small manufacturers specializing in&#13;
         tools and equipment for the refinery in Barrancabermeja emerged in Bucaramanga, over&#13;
         time diversifying into related industry segments needing similar capabilities.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Technology development: Out of the oil industry, other innovative petroleum-based&#13;
         technologies have emerged, some with commercial applications (e.g. asphalt, bitumen,&#13;
         polymers, etc.), in turn strengthening the regionâ&#128;&#153;s overall technological capabilities.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Public finances: Royalties from natural resources13 have augmented the coffers of both&#13;
         municipal and departmental governments, reducing the tax burden on residents while&#13;
         enabling the provision of quality public services, addressing infrastructure needs,&#13;
         investing in education and public health, and policies aimed at poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
   Until 2011, Santander received more in royalties than most other departments, based on its status as an oil-&#13;
producing region. Since 2011, royalties have been redistributed more equally among Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s departments, with&#13;
Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s share greatly reduced. Along with this redistribution came earmarks on how the funds may be used,&#13;
with set percentages set aside for water supply, healthcare, education, and scientific research. Bucaramanga did not&#13;
seem to be much affected by this change, however: while receiving proportionally less than before, increased&#13;
transparency and reduced corruption have helped to keep funding levels constant for vital public services.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 29&#13;
&amp;#12;Lessons for Other Cities&#13;
&#13;
Bucaramanga offers valuable lessons for other cities around the world seeking to grow&#13;
their economies and create jobs. Ultimately, the main purpose of these case studies is to&#13;
understand what cities did well, exactly how they did it, and which lessons might be replicable&#13;
elsewhere. Though each cityâ&#128;&#153;s circumstances are somewhat unique, Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s experience&#13;
provides an example of what can be done to boost a cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic competitiveness, regardless&#13;
of which particular actors undertake specific interventions. Key lessons for other cities from&#13;
Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s experience include:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Mobilize economic development stakeholders into a citywide (or in this particular&#13;
      case, regional) growth coalition to work together for residentsâ&#128;&#153; shared prosperity.&#13;
      Such a coalition can but does not have to be led by the public sector â&#128;&#147; capacity to&#13;
      undertake proactive interventions may lie in various kinds of institutions. In&#13;
      Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s case, the growth coalition was private sector-driven, in the form of the&#13;
      Regional Competitiveness Coalition. In cities where the private sector is reasonably well&#13;
      developed, and where the law allows it, for-profit firms and their associations such as&#13;
      chambers of commerce or sector guilds can play a critical role in spurring economic&#13;
      development, from convening stakeholders and formulating strategies, to the&#13;
      implementation of plans, as well as various forms of tangible support along the way.&#13;
      Besides private-sector actors, effective growth coalitions can (and most often should)&#13;
      include government agencies, plus other stakeholder groups like universities, industry&#13;
      associations, and other elements of civil society. Bucaramanga demonstrates the value of&#13;
      building a cohesive growth coalition to champion its regionâ&#128;&#153;s economic development&#13;
      and interests, with businesspeople and public officials successfully acting in concert with&#13;
      other stakeholders. Beyond financial resources, the business community may be able to&#13;
      provide valuable insights into constraints to company formation and growth in the city,&#13;
      leverage their knowledge of products and markets, and exert influence on higher tiers of&#13;
      government to ensure critically important interventions in the community, such as&#13;
      infrastructure upgrades. A strong local identity is a helpful but not necessary condition.&#13;
&#13;
   2. In formulating a metropolitan (or regional) economic development strategy,&#13;
      prioritize among sectors to target for proactive efforts according to robust analytics&#13;
      and objective criteria, while also taking into consideration stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; input.&#13;
      Recent economic history is littered with examples of failed local strategies based on&#13;
      aspirations, unrealistic perceptions of external market trends, and strong â&#128;&#156;leadershipâ&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; a&#13;
      single-minded determination to stay the course even when the results expected do not&#13;
      materialize. Indeed, too many communities spend scarce resources chasing extremely&#13;
      unlikely prospects, rather than focusing their efforts in areas where they stand a realistic&#13;
      chance of being successful. Bucaramanga has avoided such pitfalls by employing a very&#13;
      evidence-based approach to strategy development, along with a familiarity with global&#13;
      best practices (e.g. Michael Porterâ&#128;&#153;s cluster theories). However, even the most lucid&#13;
      data-driven strategies may not succeed if there isnâ&#128;&#153;t also sufficient buy-in from those&#13;
      responsible for their implementation. Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s regional competitiveness plan was so&#13;
                                                                                               30&#13;
&amp;#12;    successful not just because it utilized cutting-edge diagnostic and market analysis tools,&#13;
    but also because those hard data were then used to inform frank discussions of regional&#13;
    economic priorities within the RCC. Sectors ultimately selected for proactive support&#13;
    measures enjoyed the full buy-in of key institutional actors, such as the Chamber of&#13;
    Commerce, industry groups, universities, and select government agencies. This went a&#13;
    long way towards ensuring that what was agreed would actually get done in practice,&#13;
    even in the absence of any formal implementation or accountability mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
3. Embrace globalization as a strategic opportunity, not a threat to seek protection&#13;
   from. While Colombia as a whole has been an enthusiastic proponent of free trade&#13;
   agreements and increased cross-border investment, Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economic structure&#13;
   (heavily reliant on high-ubiquity, commoditized manufacturing) made it particularly&#13;
   vulnerable to competition from low-cost imports. While some degree of economic&#13;
   dislocation was inevitable, Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s leaders sought ways of adapting to new&#13;
   external circumstances over which they had little control. Strengthened global&#13;
   competitiveness of local industries was thus borne out of necessity. One way to cope was&#13;
   by helping local firms in existing industries (e.g. garments, footwear, agribusiness) to&#13;
   innovate and compete on quality and product differentiation, rather than primarily on&#13;
   price. Another was to leverage existing local strengths (R&amp;D, human capital, business&#13;
   acumen, language, etc.) to make a concerted push into new, often highly tradable&#13;
   industry segments likely to drive tomorrowâ&#128;&#153;s economy â&#128;&#147; among them, ICT, healthcare,&#13;
   tourism, and business services. This approach appears to be yielding very tangible&#13;
   results, as Bucaramanga firms are becoming increasingly integrated into the global&#13;
   marketplace, while foreign companies are looking at Santander as a suitable investment&#13;
   destination in ways previously unimaginable. While internationalization is just one&#13;
   dimension of local industriesâ&#128;&#153; transformation, it is arguably among the most impactful.&#13;
&#13;
4. Leverage national support programs. National governments often provide incentives&#13;
   schemes and other forms of entrepreneurial assistance â&#128;&#147; among them financial, technical,&#13;
   information, market access, customized workforce training, dedicated infrastructure, etc.&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; which can make a material difference to economic outcomes at the city level.&#13;
   Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s firms have taken advantage of such help with much success and&#13;
   frequency, aided by the highly-skilled professionals at its Chamber of Commerce and&#13;
   industry associations â&#128;&#147; not just by raising awareness of such programsâ&#128;&#153; existence, but&#13;
   also by assisting companies to access this source of support. An often-heard remark&#13;
   about Bucaramanga in the national capital, Bogota, was that Santandereanos are&#13;
   incredibly effective and timely in submitting proposals for grants and other forms of&#13;
   support from the central government. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, partly because&#13;
   of this, and partly because of the keen ability of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s representatives in the&#13;
   national government to act as a unified caucus when advocating on behalf of their&#13;
   department, Santander has enjoyed significant support from Bogota for a variety of&#13;
   initiatives directly enabling or affecting economic development in the region.&#13;
&#13;
5. If endowed with natural resources, use the proceeds to strengthen public services&#13;
   and enable economic diversification, rather than squander the funds on high-&#13;
                                                                                           31&#13;
&amp;#12;profile but ultimately lower-impact projects. Santander has used its oil revenues to&#13;
bolster education, public health, and reduce poverty, instead of building mega-&#13;
monuments or flagship facilities. Far from turning Santander into a petro-state,&#13;
hydrocarbons have helped the development of innovative technologies, companies, and&#13;
know-how directly benefiting economic growth and diversification, while also&#13;
alleviating pressure on public finances. The typical pitfalls were avoided through a&#13;
combination of increased transparency, an improving security situation in Colombia,&#13;
public â&#128;&#156;watchdogâ&#128;&#157; activities by the Chamber and other actors, and closer scrutiny and&#13;
demands by the departmentâ&#128;&#153;s citizenry at large&#13;

&amp;#12;Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s International Trade&#13;
&#13;
Santander Department, of which Bucaramanga is the capital, only ranks as Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s 11th&#13;
largest exporter, despite having the countryâ&#128;&#153;s 4th largest GDP. Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s annual export volume,&#13;
particularly to neighboring Venezuela, has fluctuated quite a bit in recent years. However,&#13;
Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s share of Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s total exports has held fairly constant.&#13;

Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s Exports to Venezuela&#13;
&#13;
Trade with neighboring Venezuela merits separate examination, given its traditional importance&#13;
to Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s small manufacturers as their primary export market. Due to deteriorating&#13;
political relations between the two countries, Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s exports to Venezuela plunged from&#13;
about a third of a billion dollars in 2009, to almost nothing in 2010. Since then, there has been a&#13;
slow rebound in bilateral trade between the two neighbors, benefitting Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s economy&#13;
(mostly meat producers).&#13;

Excerpt from Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s Regional Competitiveness Plan&#13;
&#13;
Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s Regional Competitiveness Commission was the first one in the country to create a&#13;
strategic plan for its region. In addition to being a pioneering effort, the plan and its&#13;
implementation are often cited around Colombia as an example of the successful regionalization&#13;
of the national economic competitiveness agenda â&#128;&#147; selecting those aspects of it that apply to a&#13;
given department.&#13;
&#13;
The 25-year Regional Competitiveness Plan for Santander was formulated in 2007, then updated&#13;
in 2012.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            37&#13;
&amp;#12;To help make Santander the most competitive department in the country by 2032, three&#13;
â&#128;&#156;strategic pillarsâ&#128;&#157; were identified to drive its economic development: cluster development;&#13;
formalization and entrepreneurial development; and internationalization. These pillars were&#13;
supported by four cross-cutting â&#128;&#156;strategic linesâ&#128;&#157; enabling them: infrastructure; the development&#13;
of science, technology, and innovation; metropolitan integration and strengthening; and&#13;
government transparency and efficiency. Below is a closer look at these pillars and strategic&#13;
lines, and how they were implemented as priorities identified in the strategic plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of each item in the strategic plan was assigned to a specific task team,&#13;
consisting of RCC and/or Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce staff, representatives of&#13;
government agencies (national as well as local), universities, the business community, and&#13;
various other stakeholders, as applicable. Through a multi-month consultative process, specific&#13;
objectives were established, to be achieved according to set timelines. Potential risks and&#13;
resources required to accomplish the objective, where applicable, were also included. The&#13;
schematic below is an example of an action item from the strategic plan, this particular one&#13;
focused on establishing an agency to attract foreign direct investment (now known as Invest in&#13;
Santander, and housed within the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             38&#13;
&amp;#12;The research department of the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce monitors progress made on&#13;
an ongoing basis, and these metrics are then fed into the next round of strategic plan updates. A&#13;
summary of the process is below.&#13;
&#13;
1. Cluster Development: The regional competitiveness plan established a process to identify&#13;
   priority sectors, take steps for their further development, and improve the conditions and&#13;
   factors affecting each sector. The RCCâ&#128;&#153;s work was based on a close familiarity with Michael&#13;
   Porterâ&#128;&#153;s cluster theories (and he actually visited Bucaramanga last year for a conference).&#13;
&#13;
   a) Sector Awareness: Relying on the highly sophisticated in-house economic research&#13;
      capabilities of the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce, a dedicated task team under the&#13;
      RCC umbrella worked to identify sectors of the local economy that have a strong&#13;
      concentration of existing businesses and employment, sector assets (like R&amp;D facilities&#13;
      and educational programs), and market prospects for further industry growth, both&#13;
      nationally and globally. The RCC worked to standardize the terminology used, so that all&#13;
      stakeholders â&#128;&#147; and particularly companies from a given industry cluster â&#128;&#147; were referring&#13;
      to the same things during consultative sessions. They worked with various stakeholders&#13;
      to explain the concept of cluster-based economic competitiveness, and how it can be&#13;
      enhanced.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Identification of priority sectors for Santander: An analysis was conducted before&#13;
           identifying or prioritizing key industries to ensure that initiatives accentuated&#13;
           competitive advantages and were adaptable to global trends. For instance, a chart was&#13;
           developed to plot each of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s existing industries. They were analyzed in&#13;
           terms of their existing size and strength in the region versus their competitiveness in&#13;
           the future global economy. The placement of the firms on the chart helped identify&#13;
           which sectors would become priority sectors if scaled up, which sectors needed to be&#13;
           developed further to become a competitive strength, which sectors needed more in-&#13;
           depth research or improvements to become more competitive globally, and which&#13;
           sectors needed an overall transformation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               39&#13;
&amp;#12;       â&#128;¢   Workshop for identified sectors to adopt a common language and framework&#13;
&#13;
   b) Development Initiatives: The RCC and its partners worked with stakeholders to ensure a&#13;
      sufficient degree of buy-in, without which proactive cluster development strategies&#13;
      cannot succeed. Several analyses were carried out for the development of particular&#13;
      clusters, not necessarily by outside consultants (often by the Chamberâ&#128;&#153;s or university&#13;
      researchers).&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Companiesâ&#128;&#153; will to improve their cluster&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Consultant services for cluster development&#13;
&#13;
   c) Business Environment: These are improvements to the general business environment,&#13;
      some of which disproportionately favor the development of specific targeted industries â&#128;&#147;&#13;
      for example, industry-specific training programs.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Recognition of conditions specific to each cluster&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Talent formation&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Public and private-sector transparency and efficiency&#13;
&#13;
2. Formalization and Entrepreneurial Development: With rates of informality exceeding the&#13;
   national average, bringing businesses in Bucaramanga and Santander into the formal&#13;
   economy was and is a priority. Further, raising firmsâ&#128;&#153; productivity was seen as one of the&#13;
   only paths to sustained growth. Improving firmsâ&#128;&#153; engagement, interaction, and community&#13;
   participation were also seen as important.&#13;
&#13;
   a) Facilitation of Formalization: In collaboration with national agencies such as Findeter&#13;
      and local government officials, assisting companies in various industires (not just the&#13;
      targeted clusters) to formalize, thereby enjoying access to the financial system, export&#13;
      assistance, etc. in return for paying business taxes and social contributions.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Agreements with municipalities to adopt a joint strategy for formalization&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Simplification of procedures (inspection visits, building permits, establishment of a&#13;
           Business Services Center in Floridablanca)&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Carrying out a business census in 2009&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Building confidence among entrepreneurs&#13;
&#13;
   b) Productivity Improvements: The Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce and its partner&#13;
      entities work with universities and firms across industries to help them improve their&#13;
      business processes, develop better technological solutions, thus becoming more&#13;
      productive and profitable. Specific activities include training workshops, application for&#13;
      national funding for industrial restructuring, and fostering closer collaboration with&#13;
      university researchers and instructors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             40&#13;
&amp;#12;       â&#128;¢   Formulation and implementation of projects to improve productivity in existing&#13;
           sectors&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Transfer of technology and know-how to improve business productivity&#13;
&#13;
   c) Sustainability: The RCC and Chamber have enjoyed much success in tapping corporate&#13;
      foundations and similar funding sources for various initiatives helping Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      SMEs and environment.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Improving Corporate Social Responsibility among Santander companies&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Professionalization of corporate boards&#13;
&#13;
   d) Entrepreneurship: The Chamber holds entrepreneurship training programs (subsidized&#13;
      from its own funds if the trainees canâ&#128;&#153;t pay, such as a startup firm). While networking in&#13;
      Bucaramanga has improved and there have been some angel investors supporting new&#13;
      business ventures, there is no meaningful emergence of US-style VC funds.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Promoting the creation of venture capital funds&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Promoting entrepreneurship&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Formation of an entrepreneurial network&#13;
&#13;
3. Internationalization: With Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s greater openness to the outside world, international&#13;
   economic linkages were seen as a key area of opportunity to stimulate growth in the local&#13;
   economy. Trade, logistics, FDI, and tourism were all included in the plan.&#13;
&#13;
   a) Promotion of international and domestic tourism: The RCC identified tourism as one of&#13;
      the main job-creation engines for Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s next economy. Although starting from a&#13;
      very low base, the regionâ&#128;&#153;s tourism industry has been developing rapidly, and now boasts&#13;
      58 hotels, a new convention center in Bucaramanga, and the Chicamocha National Park,&#13;
      established through public investment. Chicamocha is now having a clustering effect of&#13;
      other tourism-related businesses (Orlando-style), including numerous adventure and&#13;
      nature tourism attractions and an Aquatic Park.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Training programs and certification&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Development of a tourism marketing plan and informational materials, including a&#13;
           website&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Product development, including bird-watching, historic sights, health tourism, and&#13;
           ecotourism&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Participation in existing international trade fairs and events, and organizing tourism&#13;
           marketing events and workshops in Santander and abroad&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Establishment of a tourism network to research the market and promote the region&#13;
           overseas, including enlisting the support of Colombians living abroad to serve as&#13;
           ambassadors of Santander tourism&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Establishment of a Convention Bureau to guide the short-, medium- and long-term&#13;
           development of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s tourism industry&#13;
                                                                                              41&#13;
&amp;#12;b) Attracting foreign direct investment: Based on the strategic planâ&#128;&#153;s recommendation,&#13;
   Invest in Santander agency was established within the Bucaramanga Chamber of&#13;
   Commerce. In collaboration with the Zona Franca Santander, local governments, and&#13;
   ProExport Colombia, the initiative has had some significant successes in recent years,&#13;
   attracting a call center from Arvato/Bertelsmann employing over 1,000 people, and&#13;
   Bucaramanga has recently been featured in several global site selection publications, such&#13;
   as the Financial Times fDi Intelligence.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Preparation of a guide for international investors, and its dissemination&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Modelled after Invest in Bogota, establishment of an investment promotion agency&#13;
       for Santander to assist existing and new investors with projects, and clearly defining&#13;
       who will be in charge of it.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Creation of an environment favorable for foreign investment, including clear&#13;
       investment policies and incentives, and development of a bilingual workforce.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Identification of sectors with the greatest potential to attract FDI, and targeting&#13;
       promotion efforts accordingly&#13;
&#13;
c) Promotion of foreign trade: The strategic plan identified exports as an obvious area of&#13;
   growth opportunity for Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s companies. Various programs, funded from both&#13;
   national and local sources, have been put in place to assist local companies to sell&#13;
   overseas, such as the training at Universidad de Santo Tomas and ProExportâ&#128;&#153;s Formacion&#13;
   Programa Exportadora, which identifies new companies that may be able to export their&#13;
   goods and/or services. Yet results remain fairly modest, with only 370 firms actually&#13;
   exporting (of which about two thirds are in the garment industry, collectively exporting&#13;
   just US$22 million). Oil still accounts for about two thirds of the US$1 billion in annual&#13;
   exports from the region, though this does not include fast-growing services exports like&#13;
   education, healthcare, tourism, and BPO.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Exporter training programs&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Market diversification&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Attending trade shows and other international events&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Identification of new exportable/competitive products in the region for marketing&#13;
       abroad, including those commercialized from university research&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Annual business conference sponsored by the Mayor of Bucaramanga (Gran Rueda&#13;
       Internacional de Negocios â&#128;&#147; GRIN). Bringing together local producers with national&#13;
       and international buyers&#13;
&#13;
d) Consolidation of logistics platforms and free trade zones: The strategic plan aims to build&#13;
   on Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s strategic location between Bogota and the Atlantic coast to attract&#13;
   logistics and distribution facilities. Within the Zona Franca as well as throughout the&#13;
   area, facilities are being readied to accommodate greater freight flows once present&#13;
   infrastructure upgrades are completed. A key strategic priority is also attracting&#13;
   commercial air service to Miami, seen as a vital enabler for several development&#13;
   priorities.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           42&#13;
&amp;#12;       â&#128;¢   Taking advantage of the national policy on free trade zones and logistics to develop&#13;
           them in Santander and its metropolitan area&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Supporting individual logistics projects, including by creating appropriate committees&#13;
           to monitor and support the entities involved&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Promoting aviation and attracting major international logistics operators involved in&#13;
           foreign trade&#13;
&#13;
As noted above, the Regional Competitiveness Plan provided that the three pillars of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economic development be enabled by four cross-cutting â&#128;&#156;strategic linesâ&#128;&#157;: infrastructure; science,&#13;
technology, and innovation; metropolitan integration and strengthening; and government&#13;
transparency and efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
1. Infrastructure: The Regional Competitiveness Plan envisaged the upgrading of all major&#13;
   modes of transportation in Santander (road, air, river, urban mass transit, and tentatively rail,&#13;
   should the national government make progress on that front), plus electrical power&#13;
   generation and distribution, water resources management and supply, waste management,&#13;
   and the construction of affordable housing. In practice, practically all infrastructure&#13;
   initiatives fell outside the remit of the Commission, so it was up to government agencies at&#13;
   different levels (municipal, departmental, or national) to implement them. Still, these&#13;
   initiatives played a role in boosting Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s economic development (e.g. the&#13;
   reconstruction and expansion of Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s airport is of vital economic importance for&#13;
   tourism, exports of health services, precision manufacturers, and business in general).&#13;
&#13;
2. Science, Technology, and Innovation: Initiatives in science, technology, and innovation&#13;
   (STI) are seen as absolutely critical to Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to build a new knowledge-based&#13;
   economy. The plan places a particular emphasis on strengthening the ties between area&#13;
   universities and the private sector, with local government playing a convening role, and the&#13;
   national government providing important sources of funding.&#13;
&#13;
   a) Committee on University-Business-Government Cooperation (ComitÃ© Universidad&#13;
      Empresa Estado â&#128;&#147; CUEES)&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Dynamic engagement of most entrepreneurs taking part in CUEES&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Institutionalizing PROMOVER as the principal regional event for cooperation&#13;
        between universities, government, and the private sector&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Increasing the number of research and innovation projects carried out in partnership&#13;
        between business and the universities&#13;
&#13;
   b) Funding STI initiatives:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Proposing projects to fund&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Allocating 2 % of regional GDP for investment in STI&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Ensuring that 50% of investment in STI be by the private sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 43&#13;
&amp;#12;   c) Strengthening scientific capacity&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Strengthening scientific institutions with the regionâ&#128;&#153;s existing and emerging&#13;
          industries of strategic importance&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Promoting a culture of intellectual property&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Promoting the development of scientific capacity in children and youth&#13;
&#13;
   d) Institutional strengthening&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Strengthening Unired (Network of Universities and Research Centers of Eastern&#13;
          Colombia)&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Fostering collaboration between CUEES and CODECYT&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Commissioning of the GuatiguarÃ¡ Technology Park.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Strengthening the local technology business incubators&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Strengthening the Bucaramanga Interactive Science and Technology Park â&#128;&#147;&#13;
          Neomundo&#13;
&#13;
3. Metropolitan Integration and Strengthening: The elimination of administrative barriers to&#13;
   investment and growth within Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s only metropolitan area is seen as a key strategic&#13;
   priority. Consolidation of the four municipalities of Bucaramanga, Floridablanca,&#13;
   Piedecuesta, and Giron into a unified Bucaramanga metropolitan area is something its&#13;
   Chamber of Commerce has been advocating for some time.&#13;
&#13;
4. Efficient and Transparent State: In line with developments in the rest of Colombia, there is&#13;
   an increased emphasis on government agencies serving the citizen. Elimination of corruption&#13;
   and waste, and responsiveness to citizensâ&#128;&#153; needs&#13;
&#13;
The strategic planâ&#128;&#153;s priorities outlined above are numerous, and with a variety of entities and&#13;
individuals responsible for their implementation. There is no dedicated source of funding for&#13;
these priorities, but Santander has actually been the most successful department in the country in&#13;
terms of preparing timely applications for funding from national sources (channeled through&#13;
various agencies) and submitting winning proposals. In addition to national funds,&#13;
Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s business community has generously contributed to economic development&#13;
initiatives, both financially through the Chamber of Commerce, and in-kind in various ways â&#128;&#147;&#13;
through the engagement of top executives, mentoring programs, and utilizing their vast&#13;
relationship capital in Bogota and abroad to create new market opportunities for local firms.&#13;
&#13;
As noted, the strategic plan has no formal mechanism to compel anyone to do what they commit&#13;
to. There are no rewards or penalties built into the process, just the power of persuasion and a&#13;
sense that all have a stake in the economic fortunes of their city and region. Through the&#13;
Chamber, professional associations, and other civil society organizations, the business&#13;
community does not hesitate to lobby public officials to invest in their priorities, including&#13;
education and infrastructure, especially transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               44&#13;
&amp;#12;Progress is monitored by relying on the exceptionally strong research capabilities of the&#13;
Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce, as well as national benchmarking reports such as those&#13;
from CPC and CEPEC/URosario, plus international rankings compiled by the IDB, World Bank&#13;
(Doing Business), ECLAC, WEF, and others. There appears to be a strong local consensus in&#13;
favor of proactive economic development efforts, and working collaboratively to reach that&#13;
US$20,000 target in per capita GDP as soon as possible.&#13;
&#13;
National Agencies&#13;
&#13;
Several Colombian national government agencies have a role in local and regional economic&#13;
development, covering a variety of functional areas like planning, infrastructure, workforce&#13;
development, scientific research and technology development, capital access, and international&#13;
trade and investment. Individual agencies are tasked with administering specific programs&#13;
designed to strengthen the competitiveness of the Colombian economy and those of its regions.&#13;
These key agencies include:&#13;
&#13;
National Competitiveness and Innovation Commission (ComisiÃ³n Nacional de&#13;
Competitividad e InnovaciÃ³n â&#128;&#147; CNCeI) is headed by the President of the Republic, and&#13;
includes the heads of various central government agencies with a role in economic development,&#13;
representatives of Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s departments and municipalities, labor unions, universities, think&#13;
tanks, and the private sector, including industry guilds and the national association of chambers&#13;
of commerce (ConfecÃ¡maras). The Commission meets once a month to assess the status of the&#13;
national competitiveness agenda. The Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness advisor14 cites infrastructure,&#13;
foreign trade, productivity, and more resources to help companies innovate and export as the top&#13;
priorities for the Commission at the present time. Out of 109 current initiatives to promote&#13;
competitiveness, 20 have been identified as top priorities by the Commission.&#13;
&#13;
Financiera del Desarrollo Territorial (Findeter) is the countryâ&#128;&#153;s main public development&#13;
fund and grant administrator. Findeter supports funding by financial intermediaries to&#13;
municipalities and companies providing public services. Working through local government&#13;
partners, Findeter focuses on urban and geospatial development and environmental sustainability&#13;
(e.g. through its Sustainable Cities program), as well as the formalization of family-owned and&#13;
other small businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   In person interview with Dr. Jaime Bueno Miranda, Senior Presidential Advisor for Competitiveness and&#13;
Strategic Projects, Presidency of the Republic of Colombia, in Bogota, DC, on March 31, 2014.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                           45&#13;
&amp;#12;Bancoldex, Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s trade and development bank, provides export finance and financial&#13;
assistance to Colombian firms (but only formal ones â&#128;&#147; this does not cover the 43% of companies&#13;
in the informal sector). The Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s office develops guidelines for funding programs, like the&#13;
fund for the development of SMEs.&#13;
&#13;
Programa de TransformaciÃ³n Productiva (PTP), a Bancoldex affiliate, supports individual&#13;
companies in 20 designated industry sectors, in coordination with the regions, by providing&#13;
technical assistance, management know-how, and working to address remaining administrative&#13;
impediments to their formalization and growth. PTPâ&#128;&#153;s activities represent a national-level â&#128;&#156;betâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
on specific industries as drivers of economic prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
INNpulsa, another key affiliate of Bancoldex, provides both funding and technical assistance to&#13;
SMEs in particular, through direct support, matching grants, microfinance, training workshops,&#13;
and dedicated funds aimed at fostering innovation, such as Rutas Competitivas and MiPYMEâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
â&#128;&#156;productive chainsâ&#128;&#157; initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism (MinCIT) also supports entrepreneurship&#13;
and sectoral development, both directly and through its institutional affiliates, such as the public-&#13;
private partnership known as the Centro Nacional de Productividad or the Fondo Nacional de&#13;
Garantias. This support can be in the form of funding and/or guarantees, know-how, or simply&#13;
the convening power of the national government to bring together disparate institutional actors.&#13;
MinCIT also conducts very detailed monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of the national&#13;
governmentâ&#128;&#153;s investments in economic development, which helps to ensure accountability and a&#13;
focus on results.&#13;
&#13;
Department of National Planning (DNP) is responsible for Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s overall National&#13;
Development Plan (currently for the period 2010-2014), which includes economic development&#13;
as one of its priority areas along with social and human development. DNP has an important role&#13;
in channeling national funding for critical enabling investments such as infrastructure to&#13;
Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s departments and municipalities. DNP also supports select individual initiatives such&#13;
as the nationwide network of technology development centers (Centros de Desarrollo&#13;
Technologico), which foster entrepreneurship and industry-academia collaboration. DNP also&#13;
provides assistance and sometimes funding to regions to determine their own areas of&#13;
competitive advantage to target for proactive interventions.&#13;
&#13;
ProExport Colombia is the countryâ&#128;&#153;s trade, tourism, and investment promotion agency. It&#13;
follows a targeted sector strategy in both investment attraction and export facilitation, with a&#13;
particular focus on high value-added and â&#128;&#156;non-traditionalâ&#128;&#157; sectors of the economy, such as ICT&#13;
or BPO. In trade, ProExport has in place a variety of programs to support Colombian exporters&#13;
(again, limited to formal firms), including trade shows, export development missions (inbound&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  46&#13;
&amp;#12;and outbound), buyer/seller match-making, and subsidizing overseas trips for Colombian firms&#13;
trying to export. In FDI attraction, ProExport works with Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s cities and regions to help&#13;
them articulate their individual value propositions for international investors, set up their own&#13;
investment promotion entities if interested, and to share experiences and best practices amongst&#13;
such regional entities. ProExport also emphasizes investor aftercare, regularly following up with&#13;
foreign investors after the transactions are completed. ProExport maintains a network of&#13;
international offices around the world, as well as eight regional offices throughout Colombia,&#13;
including a highly active office in Bucaramanga which covers part of eastern Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s National Learning Service (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje â&#128;&#147; SENA) is the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s workforce development agency, which works very closely with universities, local and&#13;
regional government, and employers to ensure the supply of skilled workers for the jobs that&#13;
need to be filled. Most notably, SENA designs and implements (often in collaboration with local&#13;
educational institutions) customized training programs needed by individual companies, usually&#13;
paid for by the national government. This gives local economic developers a key competitive&#13;
tool in the race to attract investors.&#13;
&#13;
Colciencias (Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s equivalent of the National Science Foundation in the United States)&#13;
provides funding for fundamental as well as applied university research in a variety of scientific&#13;
disciplines, helping knowledge creation and the commercialization of technologies. Scientific&#13;
research also benefits from the legal provision that 10% of royalties from national resources in&#13;
Colombia be set aside for scientific research.&#13;
&#13;
Testing of Standardized Research Hypotheses&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the reportâ&#128;&#153;s Introduction, this is the first in a series of case studies of economically&#13;
successful cities around the world. In order to ensure comparability of â&#128;&#156;teachable momentsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
across all case studies, a set of standardized hypotheses was tested in Bucaramanga to determine&#13;
the exact scope for research at the metropolitan level, factors that may have most affected how&#13;
those prerogatives were used, and the extent to which specific interventions (and how they were&#13;
implemented) may have resulted in the economic outcomes observed.&#13;
&#13;
The first hypothesis tested seeks to determine to what extent Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economic results&#13;
were attributable to proactively picking sectors to support, the second one looks at the strategic&#13;
planning process itself and how it may have affected economic growth, and the third one looks at&#13;
the planâ&#128;&#153;s implementation.&#13;
&#13;
1.     Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economic success is attributable to its having made strategic bets on&#13;
       specific industrial initiatives, rather than just making improvements to its general&#13;
       investment climate in order to stimulate economic activity. Although national and&#13;
       local-level improvements to the business climate have helped the achievement of superior&#13;
                                                                                                 47&#13;
&amp;#12;        economic outcomes, proactive initiatives are likely to be the greater part of the reasons&#13;
        for Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s success.&#13;
&#13;
        Bucaramanga has benefitted from a favorable and improving business climate at the&#13;
        national level, including improved security and public safety, greater transparency and&#13;
        reduced corruption, better connectivity (telecommunications and transport), greater&#13;
        market competition, reduced barriers to external trade and investment, streamlined&#13;
        business regulation, and systematic efforts to formalize informal companies. Local-level&#13;
        business climate improvements include massive public investment in education, poverty&#13;
        reduction, the provision of infrastructure and public services, and simplification of&#13;
        company registration procedures for entrepreneurs (one-stop).&#13;
&#13;
        Proactive economic development initiatives which are likely to have contributed to&#13;
        Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economic success include industry sector targeting, establishment of the&#13;
        Invest in Santander promotion agency and Zona Franca free trade zone, establishment of&#13;
        entrepreneurial networks and support services, design and implementation of industry&#13;
        and even firm-specific (customized) worker training programs, strengthening industry-&#13;
        academia collaboration in specific sectors, building dedicated facilities such as research&#13;
        labs, a convention center, and the Chicamocha National Park, as well as upgrading the&#13;
        airport (to boost tourism, but also industries dependent on time-sensitive delivery). There&#13;
        are no sector-specific tax incentives; however, lower business tax rates apply if investors&#13;
        locate in FTZs. Beyond these proactive initiatives at the local/regional level,&#13;
        Bucaramanga has been exceptionally successful at tapping into national sources of&#13;
        financial and technical support (often directed at specific industry sectors), such as&#13;
        export-assistance programs, innovation grants, entrepreneurial assistance, formalization&#13;
        programs, and infrastructure/project funding. Ingredients of success:&#13;
&#13;
        a. As an economically successful city, Bucaramanga has no single dominant theme â&#128;&#147;&#13;
           its success is attributable to the interplay of several key factors. Probably the most&#13;
           important single factor, although on its own insufficient to explain this metropolitan&#13;
           economyâ&#128;&#153;s success, is the comparatively high level of human capital. This has&#13;
           resulted in higher adaptability and enabled Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s transition into a&#13;
           knowledge-based economy.15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
   For example, politically, the RCCs didnâ&#128;&#153;t work; the National level set up a framework but didnâ&#128;&#153;t give guidance on&#13;
implementation or funding to pay for the time of qualified professionals. The differentiators for why Santander&#13;
Competitivo was one of the most successful RCCs in the country were the support of the Chamber of Commerce&#13;
and ability of professionals within Santander Competitivo. This development capacity included the ability to&#13;
effectively use tools like INNpulsa and partner universities; to identify goals and prioritize project proposals to&#13;
obtain funding; to employ systemic approaches to collaboration and implementation; and to utilize prior&#13;
collaborative development plans that had simply lacked funding.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 48&#13;
&amp;#12;     b. Bucaramanga has focused its proactive economic development efforts on developing&#13;
        industries producing tradable goods and services, including oil &amp; gas, tourism, food&#13;
        processing, ICT, high value-added manufacturing (such as tooling and equipment for&#13;
        the oil industry), education services, healthcare (including medical tourism), BPO,&#13;
        and logistics.&#13;
&#13;
     c. In pursuing its proactive economic development initiatives, Bucaramanga has pursued&#13;
        an integrated, three-pronged approach to business development: nurturing the&#13;
        growth of its existing firms, fostering the establishment of new start-up companies,&#13;
        and striving to attract new investment from outside the region. Companies in&#13;
        traditional sectors got assistance to improve their productivity, internationalize (i.e.&#13;
        begin exporting, and perhaps investing abroad), and ultimately adapt to global&#13;
        competition. In innovative, non-traditional sectors Bucaramanga provided&#13;
        entrepreneurial assistance through heavily subsidized programs and limited&#13;
        incubation services. Finally, by establishing a dedicated IPA within its Chamber of&#13;
        Commerce, Bucaramanga has stepped up to attract outside investors, bringing capital,&#13;
        jobs, know-how, and integration into global supply chains.&#13;
&#13;
2.   The likely trajectory Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance was altered by specific&#13;
     policy interventions provided for in its strategic plan. Around 2006-07, Bucaramanga&#13;
     started formulating its existing strategic plan for economic development. The plan was&#13;
     created in response to mounting external competitive threats (e.g. free trade agreements&#13;
     with more productive economies), and an increasing awareness that Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     economic structure would have little choice but to undergo a transformation or face a&#13;
     precipitous drop in activity. While it is difficult to prove a counterfactual (i.e. how much&#13;
     worse Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s performance would have been in the absence of any interventions),&#13;
     empirical evidence from other episodes of trade-induced shocks around the world&#13;
     suggests the drop could have been substantial. By proactively working to nurture the&#13;
     emergence of the next economy, Bucaramanga not only avoided a contraction, but&#13;
     actually started to outpace its national economy by an even wider margin than before the&#13;
     creation of a strategic plan for economic development.&#13;
&#13;
     Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s strategic planning process included:&#13;
&#13;
     a. Robust analytics to guide decision-making and strategy formulation, based on an&#13;
        intimate familiarity with global best practices in cluster development theory,&#13;
        benchmarking, and goal setting, relying on the superb economic research capabilities&#13;
        of the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              49&#13;
&amp;#12;b. A structured but not highly formalized planning process to:&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Identify key economic development issues Bucaramanga was facing, including&#13;
      the preponderance of micro and small enterprises with very few large firms, high&#13;
      rates of informality (inhibiting access to finance, support programs, and therefore&#13;
      growth), low capital investment and slow product innovation, heavy reliance on&#13;
      making commoditized products with low market differentiation, low export&#13;
      intensity, an excessive reliance on the neighboring Venezuelan market,&#13;
      incomplete market information, inadequate transport infrastructure, the absence of&#13;
      entrepreneurial networks and sector associations, and poor knowledge of English.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Identify the city's main competitive strengths, such as high levels of human&#13;
      capital, the presence of several excellent universities with advanced research&#13;
      facilities, expertise in the oil &amp; gas industry â&#128;&#147; including Ecopetrol and its research&#13;
      institute, some of the best healthcare providers in Colombia, exceptional natural&#13;
      beauty and tourism potential, a better security situation than much of the country,&#13;
      a strategic geographic location between Bogota and the Atlantic coast, and highly&#13;
      engaged private sector.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Formulate a vision of progress Santander as a whole can make in 25 years (by&#13;
      2032), including specific measures to address its challenges and to capitalize on&#13;
      the regionâ&#128;&#153;s competitive strengths.&#13;
&#13;
c. Assembling a â&#128;&#156;growth coalitionâ&#128;&#157; at the department level, under the banner of the&#13;
   Regional Competitiveness Commission (Santander Competitivo). The RCC brought&#13;
   together representatives of the departmental and municipal governments, universities&#13;
   and the scientific community, the private sector (the Chamber of Commerce and&#13;
   industry associations), labor unions, the national oil company Ecopetrol, and the&#13;
   national workforce training agency (SENA). Such broad representation of diverse&#13;
   stakeholder groups from the public and private sectors, as well as academia and civil&#13;
   society, ensured that the strategic planning process was not captured by any specific&#13;
   interests, but representative of the region at large. Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s plan was a grassroots&#13;
   effort, not imposed from above, so stakeholders have a very real sense of ownership&#13;
   and care about its outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
d. Strategic decision-making and prioritization: Bucaramanga utilized a structured&#13;
   process for identifying and agreeing on policy priorities, but not for evaluating trade-&#13;
   offs between different public investment alternatives, such as through cost-benefit&#13;
   analyses. This is because the strategic plan generally did not include monetary&#13;
   allocations for specific interventions â&#128;&#147; indeed, the RCC itself was not initially funded,&#13;
   and later received miniscule amounts of funding (US$7,000) from the national&#13;
   government. The Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce continues to house the RCC&#13;
   on its own premises, offering operational assistance from its own staff, as well as&#13;
   other resources. Inasmuch as the strategic plan called for specific capital investments&#13;
   to be made (e.g. for transport infrastructure), it relied on its partner entities for&#13;
   implementation and funding (e.g. the national Ministry of Transport, or the&#13;
   departmental government).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         50&#13;
&amp;#12;3.   The level of autonomy enjoyed by Bucaramanga and Santander in economic&#13;
     development (the equivalent of the â&#128;&#156;Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s Wedgeâ&#128;&#157;) was a significant factor in&#13;
     being able to push through interventions resulting in improved economic outcomes.&#13;
     In a decentralized country like Colombia, its administrative units (departments and&#13;
     municipalities) have much fiscal power and institutional ability to make and implement&#13;
     decisions at their respective levels. Political legitimacy stems from the fact that mayors&#13;
     and governors are popularly elected for single four-year terms, without the possibility of&#13;
     reelection. Funding for local programs comes from taxes and oil royalties, allowing for&#13;
     discretionary authority over spending decisions.&#13;
&#13;
     However, in Bucaramangaâ&#128;&#153;s case proactive economic development initiatives were led&#13;
     by the private sector, organized through the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber has&#13;
     been a driver of the areaâ&#128;&#153;s economic competitiveness agenda â&#128;&#147; since this directly impacts&#13;
     its membership â&#128;&#147; in partnership with government, academia, and other stakeholder&#13;
     groups. Characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
     a. The Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area does not have a dedicated economic&#13;
        development agency as such, or even a metropolitan-level government for that&#13;
        matter, however there are agencies at the departmental level.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Institutionally fragmented between four municipalities, the metro area has a&#13;
           coordinating body for projects of area-wide significance such as transport and&#13;
           water supply/sewerage, but its responsibilities do not include economic&#13;
           development. Individual municipalities tackle select local economic issues such as&#13;
           targeted assistance to low-income and vulnerable groups, and participate in the&#13;
           RCC. Every elected official in recent years has been supportive of economic&#13;
           growth in the metro area, but without having specific statutory obligations for it.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ At the level of Santander Department, there is a planning department that largely&#13;
           focuses on public infrastructure investments and projects of a regional&#13;
           significance. It plays primarily an enabling role in economic development, and&#13;
           builds economic competitiveness issues into its long-term regional development&#13;
           plan (but stipulates that their development is the responsibility of the RCC).&#13;
        â&#128;¢ The RCC (Santander Competitivo) is the convening, policymaking, and&#13;
           articulation body for economic development in Santander Department (although&#13;
           in practice that means largely metro Bucaramanga, where 95% of Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
           non-oil manufacturing is located, with a similar portion of its services industries).&#13;
           The RCCâ&#128;&#153;s existence is provided for in national legislation, but legally it does not&#13;
           exist as a separate entity, nor does it have a dedicated source of funding.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ The Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce also fulfils several economic&#13;
           development functions. In addition to housing the Invest in Santander IPA, it&#13;
           provides entrepreneurial training and business advisory/support services to local&#13;
           companies, and partners with ProExport Colombia on trade promotion activities.&#13;
           The Chamberâ&#128;&#153;s President and Vice Presidents participate in specific economic&#13;
           development projects, such as hosting incoming delegations of prospective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             51&#13;
&amp;#12;        investors, and promote the city and region at every turn in their materials and&#13;
        activities.&#13;
b. Internal management: The RCC has just four full-time staff positions, paid for by a&#13;
   mixture of funding from private (majority) and public sources. Its Executive Director&#13;
   is an experienced economic development and public policy professional, selected by&#13;
   and accountable to all the stakeholder groups participating in Santander Competitivo,&#13;
   and has a seat on the Board of the Bucaramanga Chamber of Commerce. The RCC&#13;
   utilizes the Chamberâ&#128;&#153;s IT infrastructure and many other kinds of operational support,&#13;
   as needed. The Chamberâ&#128;&#153;s research team monitors progress made on achieving the&#13;
   strategic planâ&#128;&#153;s objectives, but there are no formal performance incentives (rewards of&#13;
   penalties) systems in place. Still, the planâ&#128;&#153;s implementation has proceeded well even&#13;
   in the absence of such mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
c. Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s strategic plan did not just involve diverse stakeholder groups in its&#13;
   implementation; it actually relied on them to implement the bulk of objectives set in&#13;
   the plan. For example, the private sector (including the oil company Ecopetrol)&#13;
   provides a lot of the funding, corporate leaders are Santanderâ&#128;&#153;s main boosters&#13;
   working to attract outside investors and national government funding, and the&#13;
   universities collaborate with SENA to implement workforce development plans. In&#13;
   the case of Bucaramanga, domestic firms frequently invested in improving the&#13;
   existing climate and seemed less likely to leave in favor of other attractive business&#13;
   climates.&#13;
&#13;
d. Labor unions are present in the consultative process and get to express the viewpoints&#13;
   and interests of their membership, but in Colombia they are not particularly large nor&#13;
   politically influential.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
This case study of the economic success of the Indian city of Coimbatore is one of six in a series&#13;
of World Bank case studies of successful metropolitan economies around the world. The World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive Cities Knowledge Base (CCKB) project aims to provide city leaders with&#13;
the tools and knowledge for the successful formulation and implementation of proactive&#13;
economic development strategies at the city level.&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore is a landlocked mid-sized city in a lower-middle income country, with a&#13;
manufacturing-intensive economy. The city has been highly successful in improving the&#13;
prosperity of its residents, both in absolute terms, and relative to other cities in India. In fact,&#13;
over the past decade Coimbatore has had one of the best performing metropolitan economies in&#13;
the South Asia Region (SAR) in terms of GDP and employment growth (see â&#128;&#156;Coimbatore by the&#13;
Numbersâ&#128;&#157; section below).&#13;
&#13;
In Coimbatore, the role of the public sector in economic development has been somewhat&#13;
limited. Municipal governments in India do not have statutory responsibility for economic&#13;
development, instead focusing on the provision of basic public goods like infrastructure and&#13;
public safety. While there is proactive industry targeting by the state government of Tamil Nadu,&#13;
the direct effects of this on Coimbatore have been somewhat limited given the absence of state-&#13;
owned enterprises in the city.&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore is a story of private sector-driven growth, of individual for-profit firms pursuing&#13;
market opportunities which have resulted in socially desirable economic outcomes. It also&#13;
provides an example of how proactive economic development initiatives can be undertaken by&#13;
diverse actors, in the public and/or private sectors.&#13;
&#13;
This report is based on primary and secondary research by the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive&#13;
Cities Knowledge Base team16, including two weeks spent in Tamil Nadu, India, in June 2014,&#13;
interviewing government officials in Coimbatore and the state capital of Chennai, as well as&#13;
members of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business community. The report also incorporates staff feedback, among&#13;
others, received at a review event in Washington, DC, in July 2014.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
   While the CCKB team did review prior analytical work by other World Bank staff, other international donors,&#13;
consultants, and academics as background materials, the findings of this case study are overwhelmingly based on&#13;
fact-finding on the ground by the CCKB mission to Tamil Nadu, not literature reviews of dissertations and scholarly&#13;
treatises. In keeping with CCKBâ&#128;&#153;s strong focus on applied economic development and the relevance/ replicability of&#13;
each case study cityâ&#128;&#153;s experience and lessons for decision-makers in other cities around the world, the team applied&#13;
a consistent methodological framework to all the case studies, based on testing a set of core standardized research&#13;
hypotheses. Please see this reportâ&#128;&#153;s appendices for more detail.&#13;
                                                                                                                 59&#13;
&amp;#12;This report was prepared by Z. Joe Kulenovic and Drilon Gashi, with input and suggestions from&#13;
Bertine Kamphuis, Fatima Shah, and the broader CCKB team. The joint-TTLs of the CCKB&#13;
project are Austin Kilroy and Megha Mukim. Overall guidance on the project has been provided&#13;
by Ceci Sager, Sameh Wahba, Stefano Negri, and Somik Lall as senior advisors.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore provides an example of a secondary city posting strong economic results,&#13;
driven largely by the actions of private-sector actors, with local government providing an&#13;
enabling but not leading role. It is a private sector-driven success story, in which socially&#13;
desirable economic outcomes have been achieved through the activities of for-profit private&#13;
firms pursuing market opportunities, and their membership associationsâ&#128;&#153; initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore is a mid-sized, landlocked city in a lower-middle-income federal country, with&#13;
an economic structure heavily reliant on manufacturing, but with some diversification over&#13;
the past half-decade into services, primarily information technology, information&#13;
technology enabled services and business process outsourcing (IT/ITES/BPO). Family-&#13;
owned engineering firms have been the mainstay of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing economy.&#13;
Emerging sectors like logistics/distribution, food production, tourism, and healthcare are still in&#13;
their infancy, but have some growth potential.&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s success is the result of a confluence of multiple factors, some inherited, and&#13;
some enabled through deliberate interventions, mainly by private-sector actors. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
key economic characteristics include: educational attainment and vocational training levels&#13;
higher than the rest of Tamil Nadu and much of India; a tradition of entrepreneurship and small,&#13;
family-owned â&#128;&#156;cottageâ&#128;&#157; manufacturing; and diversification from traditional sectors like textiles&#13;
(which remains an important part of the city economy) and industrial machinery into precision&#13;
engineering and electromechanical components. But while the increased production of tradable&#13;
goods and services is central to Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s success story and exports are increasing in&#13;
importance, they remain somewhat limited in scope â&#128;&#147; most products are destined for customers&#13;
elsewhere in Tamil Nadu and the rest of India. Only IT and back-office services are geared&#13;
primarily towards foreign markets.&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore has enjoyed the success that it has, even in the absence of any discernible local&#13;
government interventions to spur economic development, though within a broadly&#13;
supportive national and state policy framework. The city does not have a formal economic&#13;
development strategy as such, a dedicated economic development agency, or any implementable&#13;
zoning/land use regulations.18 There is also no permanent growth coalition in Coimbatore, just&#13;
ad-hoc self-organizing by the business community regarding specific issues affecting all, or to&#13;
lobby the national or state governments, mostly for investments in infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
  As we will see in the report, land acquisition was not cited as a major impediment in Coimbatore, though it&#13;
remains a challenge throughout India. This is a particular challenge for SEZs and again did not seem to affect&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s relative success with both public and private SEZs.&#13;
                                                                                                                 61&#13;
&amp;#12;Main Growth Themes&#13;
&#13;
To ensure comparability with other CCKB case studies of economically successful cities,&#13;
Coimbatore was selected based on its performance during the period 2007 to 2012.19&#13;
During this time, the city experienced strong GDP and employment growth, outpacing both the&#13;
rest of Tamil Nadu state and India as a whole, although many of the conditions enabling this&#13;
growth were put in place in earlier periods. There are two dominant themes to Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
growth:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Organic growth of an indigenous engineering cluster: Originally home to a large&#13;
         textile industryâ&#128;&#148;Coimbatore had developed a home-grown textile machinery cluster in&#13;
         the early-to-mid 20th century by reverse-engineering imported technologies. Over time,&#13;
         these local manufacturers diversified into related industry segments requiring similar core&#13;
         competences and engineering expertise, such as metal castings, pumps, valves, precision&#13;
         tooling, and automotive components. The city eventually attained dominant status in&#13;
         Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s closed market in several individual industries, such as water-lifting pumps (60%&#13;
         market share in the 1980s to below 40% in the 1990s20). National policies also provided&#13;
         support. Import substitution protected industries such as pump manufacturing, and&#13;
         subsidies offered to farmers for buying pumps were great incentives for the clusterâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
         development. With the opening up of the Indian economy starting in the 1990s,&#13;
         Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s companies began to export, and later became suppliers to foreign investors&#13;
         in India (e.g. automotive OEMs in Chennai).21 In recent years, there has been a scaling up&#13;
         of existing firmsâ&#128;&#153; activities, as well as a proliferation of new start-up companies,&#13;
         specializing in individual niches, often as suppliers to systems integrators. Crucially, the&#13;
         engineering firms have very strong linkages to local technical colleges and vocational&#13;
         schools.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Attraction of outside investment, especially in ICT and related industries: Multinational&#13;
         firms in sectors such as ICT, BPO, ITES, and engineering services have chosen to locate&#13;
         in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s newly-built special economic zones, as well as outside of them&#13;
         (somewhat less common). Recruited by the SEZsâ&#128;&#153; private-sector developers (utilizing&#13;
         national incentive programs), the MNCs chose Coimbatore as a viable alternative to&#13;
         Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s increasingly congested, pricier Tier-1 cities starting in the mid-2000s.&#13;
         Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s incumbent business community lent its strong support to the arrival of the&#13;
         MNCs. Principal site selection considerations include the availability and cost of skilled&#13;
         labor and land (facilities), adequate infrastructure, the cityâ&#128;&#153;s strategic geographic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19&#13;
   While the period 2007-2012 ensures comparability among all cases, CCKB draws on an economic database with&#13;
figures from 2002-2012.&#13;
20&#13;
   Ibid, pp. 4207.&#13;
21&#13;
   However, the industry also faced its share of exogenous shocks, with a cut in subsidies for buying pumps, reduced&#13;
demand nationally due to a downturn in the construction industry and the increased import of pumps from China,&#13;
Italy and the U.S. (See: Ibid, pp. 4214).&#13;
                                                                                                                 62&#13;
&amp;#12;           location, a pleasant climate, good educational and health facilities, and a pro-business,&#13;
           conducive entrepreneurial ecosystem.&#13;
&#13;
While the growth story documented in this case study focuses on engineering and ICT, there are&#13;
also other prominent sectors of the local economy:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Traditional Sectors: Textiles remains the most prominent of the traditional sectors,&#13;
           employing up to 26% of Coimbatore districtâ&#128;&#153;s residents.22 Other sectors include apparel,&#13;
           jewelry and precious metals, general consumer goods, traditional handicrafts,&#13;
           construction, and food production, among others. These sectors remain important&#13;
           providers of employment for Coimbatoreans, but â&#128;&#147; with the notable exception of the&#13;
           booming construction industry â&#128;&#147; are mostly stagnating or shrinking locally. There is,&#13;
           however, visible growth in some specialized industry niches, such as medical textiles,&#13;
           some kinds of jewelry and food products, etc.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Emerging Sectors: These include education and healthcare (as tradable services, not just&#13;
           focused on serving the local population), logistics and distribution, tourism, retirees, and&#13;
           small ICT startups (offering, for example, web design services). There is significant&#13;
           scope for growth of all these industries, but very little coordinated effort to achieve this.&#13;
           The government of Tamil Nadu has made some progress in tourism promotion, and&#13;
           several new hotels have been built by private firms. But given Coimbatore districtâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
           natural beauty and rich cultural heritage, the sector remains far below its potential. The&#13;
           city is gaining popularity among retirees from other parts of India, attracted by the low&#13;
           cost of living and salubrious climate, but the industry is still in its infancy. For the growth&#13;
           of these and other sectors like logistics, further major infrastructure upgrades will be&#13;
           essential (upgrading Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s airport was an important step in the right direction).&#13;
&#13;
There are no reliable, detailed data about the relative contribution of each industry segment to&#13;
metropolitan value added and job creation. However, based on its own observations and&#13;
information obtained from its membership, the local Chamber of Commerce estimates that about&#13;
40% of new jobs in recent years have been created at Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s existing companies, 40% at&#13;
new start-up firms, and the remaining 20% at multinational companies setting up operations in&#13;
Coimbatore. Therefore, Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s growth is multi-faceted, in that it is manifested in all three&#13;
main forms of economic development activity (expansion of existing firms, formation of new&#13;
ones, and attraction of outside companies).&#13;

The principal factors of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic success could be summarized as follows:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Private-Sector Led Development: Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s private sector has been the main driving&#13;
      force behind its recent economic success, while governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role has largely focused on&#13;
      the provision of infrastructure, some incentives to outside investors, and limited financial&#13;
      and technical assistance to local firms. As noted earlier, private-sector led economic&#13;
      growth in Coimbatore over the past decade has had two principal aspects â&#128;&#147; growth of the&#13;
      indigenous engineering industry cluster, and attraction of outside investors to the city. In&#13;
      addition to advancing local economic development through their own business activities,&#13;
      Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s for-profit firms have acted as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s main boosters and promoters, and&#13;
      originally established many of the technical colleges for which Coimbatore is known.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Supportive Ecosystem: With numerous industry associations, educational and training&#13;
      facilities, trade fairs, existing agglomerations of companies, technological and&#13;
      organizational know-how, and a deep specialized labor pool, Coimbatore offers an&#13;
      environment highly conducive to company formation and growth. Industry associations&#13;
      help cluster development through knowledge sharing, entrepreneurial training, ensuring&#13;
      common quality standards, organizing business development events, and leveraging&#13;
      government programs, among other activities. Based on healthy cooperative competition&#13;
      among their member firms, these associations help build local capacity within their&#13;
      respective industries, and recognize opportunities for industry diversification and growth.&#13;
      In addition, the associations act as advocates for the city and its business community at&#13;
      the state and national levels.&#13;
&#13;
   3. Quality Workforce: The quality of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s workforce has been perhaps the&#13;
      decisive factor behind its economic success in recent years. Home-grown firms have&#13;
      expanded based on the ability to tap into local talent, while outside investors have been&#13;
      drawn to Coimbatore by the ability to hire high-caliber graduates at attractive&#13;
      compensation rates. Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s workforce quality is the result both of a highly-&#13;
      effective local educational system, and a somewhat unique approach to enhancing the&#13;
      employability of graduates. The city is renowned as a center for engineering, with a&#13;
      highly specialized labor pool and historically strong linkages between private businesses&#13;
      and educational institutions. Many of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s technical colleges were originally&#13;
      founded by family-owned local engineering firms, today offering practically-oriented&#13;
      technical curricula developed in consultation with for-profit companies. Local&#13;
      engineering students spend part of each school day on the shop floor, as well as in class,&#13;
      which sets Coimbatore apart from other cities in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India.&#13;
      There are also â&#128;&#156;finishing schoolsâ&#128;&#157; for prospective MNCs employees, teaching applied&#13;
      skills such as customer service practices, problem solving, and situational awareness.&#13;
      Most Coimbatore schools use English as the main language of instruction, a huge&#13;
      competitive advantage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               64&#13;
&amp;#12;4. Responsiveness to Market Opportunities: Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s private-sector actors have been&#13;
   highly adept at seizing market opportunities, presented by:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Multinational firmsâ&#128;&#153; quest for alternatives to sites in Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Tier-1 cities: A private&#13;
       for-profit Coimbatore company successfully recruited MNCs to its newly-built SEZ,&#13;
       in the process creating thousands of new jobs and enlisting the support of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       established business community.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Growth of the auto industry in Chennai, creating a need for sourcing components&#13;
       locally: Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s business community was highly responsive to automotive&#13;
       OEMs approaching them in search of parts for their vehicle production, quickly&#13;
       diversifying into automotive components and scaling up production.&#13;
&#13;
5. A Relatively Competitive Business Climate: The value proposition is gaining importance&#13;
   in guiding companiesâ&#128;&#153; investment decisions. Rising business costs have led many MNCs&#13;
   in India to consider second-tier cities like Coimbatore for their expansion plans. In&#13;
   addition to the cost side, such site selection considerations favor cities like Coimbatore&#13;
   which are able to provide a compelling value proposition for companies, not just low&#13;
   business costs. In addition to a highly-skilled, largely English-speaking workforce at&#13;
   competitive wage levels, Coimbatore offers MNCs additional bottom-line business&#13;
   advantages, including abundant land, good universities and technical colleges, reasonably&#13;
   good infrastructure, existing business ties to local firms, strong entrepreneurial culture, a&#13;
   growing local consumer market, a pleasant climate and quality of life, and a regulatory&#13;
   environment which compares favorably to many regional competitorsâ&#128;&#153;. This had proven&#13;
   to be an attractive combination for many companies including Bosch, Cameron, Hirotec,&#13;
   Denso, Rieter, Cognizant, Dell, IBM, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Wipro, and TCS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             65&#13;
&amp;#12;Key Lessons&#13;
&#13;
As noted earlier, some of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s success factors, and the competitive advantages on&#13;
which they are based, have been developed over a number of years and even decades. While the&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s success definitely has some unique local aspects to it, there are still â&#128;&#156;teachable momentsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
that Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s story holds for other cities. The most notable learnings include:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Focus on Core Competencies: A city does best when leveraging the real assets that it&#13;
      does have, which is exactly what Coimbatore has done. This has meant capitalizing on&#13;
      the cityâ&#128;&#153;s reputation for engineering excellence and precision manufacturing â&#128;&#147; both for&#13;
      home-grown companies to scale up, and to attract additional inward investment.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Facilitate ongoing, continuous sectoral diversification by honing the development of&#13;
      transferrable skills: Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s engineers are renowned for their aptitude in&#13;
      mechanical engineering and metal manufacturing, with skillsets easily transferrable from&#13;
      one industry segment to another. There is a specialized labor pool within a small&#13;
      geographical radius, with extensive knowledge-sharing and technological exchange,&#13;
      enabling Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s existing firms to branch out into new product lines, and aspiring&#13;
      entrepreneurs to start their own companies. This diversification is the result of individuals&#13;
      and firms pursuing concrete market opportunities, not some grand design to achieve it.&#13;
&#13;
   3. Nurture close, substantive relationships between academia and the private sector:&#13;
      Coimbatore seems unique in Tamil Nadu and India in its very high degree of industry-&#13;
      academia collaboration. Educational curricula are practically-focused and developed in&#13;
      consultation with potential employers, so students graduate with relevant, applied skills&#13;
      and extensive manufacturing shop floor experience, not just theoretical knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
   4. Foster the development of a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem: Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      mostly family-owned SMEs compete with each other for specific business opportunities,&#13;
      but also band together and self-organize to build capacity, ensure common technical&#13;
      standards, facilitate exports, or lobby the government for infrastructure upgrades. A&#13;
      critical role in this is played by industry associations, which provide technical assistance&#13;
      to their members. They know their industries and city, understand the competitive&#13;
      pressures of the marketplace, and seek to help one another wherever they can.&#13;
&#13;
   5. Build up and leverage the cityâ&#128;&#153;s human capital as a key competitive asset:&#13;
      Coimbatore has a long history of highly valuing education, particularly in the natural&#13;
      sciences and applied technologies. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s business community originally established&#13;
      the vast majority of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s technical colleges and vocational schools, both to&#13;
      develop their own talent pipeline and as a way of giving back to the community. More&#13;
      recently, Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s human capital has been touted as the key competitive advantage&#13;
      over similarly situated cities in attempting to recruit multinational firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                66&#13;
&amp;#12;6. Create a virtue out of necessity â&#128;&#147; turn the lack of attention from government into a&#13;
   strength, instead of a competitive disadvantage: Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s local leaders&#13;
   emphasized that the city had no political champions or state-owned enterprises. The&#13;
   municipal governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role has largely been limited to the provision of basic public&#13;
   goods and an enabling environment, with no concerted effort to help local firms tap into&#13;
   existing national or state-level support programs. Largely left to its own devices,&#13;
   Coimbatore shows what the private sector can accomplish on its own, provided basic&#13;
   services are taken care of and interventions by the public sector donâ&#128;&#153;t actually inhibit&#13;
   economic activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        67&#13;
&amp;#12;The National and State Context&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore has benefited from being in Tamil Nadu. City economies do not operate in a&#13;
vacuum â&#128;&#147; they are part of a national economic system, facing specific regulatory provisions and&#13;
macroeconomic trends. In Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s case, the city also happens to be located in one of&#13;
Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s most developed and economically successful states, Tamil Nadu, in the far south of the&#13;
country. India as a whole has been reaping the benefits of liberalization and macroeconomic&#13;
reforms over the past couple of decades, with increased exports and investment by multinational&#13;
firms in its economy. Indeed, a number of policy schemes have been implemented to stimulate&#13;
inward investment, particularly geared towards exporting.&#13;
&#13;
Some national trends and policies with the most visible effect on Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s recent economic&#13;
performance include:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Increased openness of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy to external trade &amp; FDI&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Slowing in the rates of GDP growth, exacerbated by political uncertainty (until recently)&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Increasingly stringent environmental regulations, such as rules on Zero Liquid Discharge&#13;
       by manufacturers; Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#153;s standards are even stricter than national ones&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Continued interest of multinational firms in investing in India, both to serve the&#13;
       expanding domestic market, and as an export platform, e.g. for IT/ITES or BPO&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Increased saturation and congestion in Tier-1 cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, or&#13;
       Hyderabad, with rising wage levels and overall business costs; spillover growth from&#13;
       such Tier-1 cities to more affordable, less congested but still viable alternatives like&#13;
       Jaipur, Indore, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Coimbatore, which offer many of the same&#13;
       advantages (business facilities, highly skilled workforce) at significantly lower cost&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Specific national programs like the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Software&#13;
       Technology Parks (STP), and Special Economic Zones (SEZ), aimed at attracting&#13;
       international investors to the country, particularly to designated parks with special tax&#13;
       treatment and better infrastructure than surrounding areas&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Support programs for MSMEs, including technical assistance, capital access, export&#13;
       assistance and finance (Small Industries Development Bank of India - SIDBI, and ExIm&#13;
       Bank), and workforce training (National Skill Development Corporation/Sector Skill&#13;
       Councils)&#13;
&#13;
At the state level, a number of developments and policies in Tamil Nadu have also had an&#13;
impact on Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s recent economic performance:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Tamil Nadu is acknowledged as one of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s most progressive states, with&#13;
       economic/social indicators and infrastructure significantly better than the national&#13;
       average, and early efforts to erase vestiges of caste-based discrimination&#13;
   â&#128;¢   The stateâ&#128;&#153;s economy is more manufacturing-intensive than Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s overall, with well-&#13;
       established clusters of automotive, machinery, electronics, and construction equipment&#13;
       producers centered in or around the state capital of Chennai&#13;
                                                                                             68&#13;
&amp;#12;     â&#128;¢   Emerging clusters in IT, software, ITES, BPO, and other higher value-added services,&#13;
         mostly driven by foreign multinationalsâ&#128;&#153; investment in the state&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#153;s Industrial Policy document, updated every few years, identifies priority&#13;
         sectors for the stateâ&#128;&#153;s economic development efforts, particularly in terms of FDI&#13;
         attraction&#13;
     â&#128;¢   FDI inflows have historically centered on Chennai (based on the â&#128;&#156;parent-childâ&#128;&#157; model),&#13;
         but more recently Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#153;s government has been offering more incentives to invest&#13;
         outside the state capital&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Support programs for home-grown MSMEs are coordinated with the central government,&#13;
         and implemented through several District Industry Centres around the state (there is one&#13;
         in Coimbatore as well), providing capital, power, and VAT subsidies, as well as&#13;
         entrepreneurial assistance including training, a single-window clearance process for&#13;
         administrative requirements, registration, and credit guarantees&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#153;s urban local bodies (ULBs) formally have legal scope for â&#128;&#156;planning for&#13;
         economic and social developmentâ&#128;&#157;.23 However, both the government and non-&#13;
         government interviewees did not mention this function being carried out in practice. The&#13;
         Coimbatore ULBs lack technical capacity (e.g. 70% of CCMC council members have&#13;
         only a primary education), and are reportedly afflicted by corruption&#13;
     â&#128;¢   According to state law, the main responsibilities of local government agencies (the&#13;
         Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation â&#128;&#147; CCMC, and the District Administration)&#13;
         include the provision of infrastructure, issuing building permits, ensuring public safety,&#13;
         and revenue administration; local government has therefore played only a supporting role&#13;
         in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic success&#13;
&#13;
Institutional Actors&#13;
&#13;
Multiple institutional actors have played a role in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic development.&#13;
Several agencies of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s national and state government have responsibilities for local and&#13;
regional economic development activities, covering a variety of functional areas like capital&#13;
access, infrastructure, entrepreneurial training, and promoting international trade and investment.&#13;
&#13;
National government agencies include:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Ministry of Micro, Medium and Small Industries, Government of India, assists state&#13;
         governments in India (in this case, the Government of Tamil Nadu) in their responsibility&#13;
         for promoting and developing Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the&#13;
         state. The Ministry provides funding and technical assistance programs for MSMEs. It&#13;
         undertakes schemes and programs for the following: 1) access to capital; 2) support for&#13;
         technology upgradation; 3) integrated infrastructure facilities; 4) testing facilities and&#13;

&amp;#12;Local Context&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore has in the past few years overtaken Madurai to become the second most&#13;
populous urban agglomeration in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu36, with 2.2 million&#13;
residents. The city proper is administered by the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation (population:&#13;
1.6 million), though much of the recent urban development has taken place outside the Municipal&#13;
Corporation limits, with new residential neighborhoods emerging around industrial areas on the&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s periphery, particularly on the north side. Until a few years ago, single-family houses were&#13;
the norm, but more recently there has been a flurry of construction of multi-story apartment&#13;
buildings, apparently catering to the lifestyle preferences of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s younger knowledge&#13;
workers in emerging sectors. Coimbatore is also the headquarters of the District of the same&#13;
name, one of 32 into which Tamil Nadu state is divided administratively.&#13;

Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s Location in Southern India&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

     According to Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s 2011 Census.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               72&#13;
&amp;#12;Coimbatore is the crossroads of southern India. Located at the foot of the Western Ghats&#13;
mountains along the Noyyal River, Coimbatore lies just 340km south of Bangalore, and less than&#13;
500km from the state capital of Tamil Nadu, Chennai. The area has long been the transport&#13;
crossroads of the southernmost part of the country, with easy access to both its east and west&#13;
coasts. Three major national highways (NH 47, NH 67, and NH 209) pass through the city, while&#13;
Coimbatore Junction is a major hub for passenger and freight rail traffic.&#13;
&#13;
The cityâ&#128;&#153;s recently upgraded airport has direct international flights to Singapore and&#13;
Sharjah, UAE, as well as to most major Indian cities. While infrastructure in Coimbatore and&#13;
Tamil Nadu in general is considered above average by Indian standards, comparatively higher&#13;
motor vehicle ownership rates mean that in practice congestion and traffic flow remain serious&#13;
challenges across the sprawling metropolitan area.&#13;
&#13;
History&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s path dependency has had a tangible influence on the city economyâ&#128;&#153;s ability to&#13;
transition into modern manufacturing, and to tap into opportunities offered by the increased&#13;
openness of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy. Coimbatore has a long history of educational excellence, social&#13;
solidarity, and higher levels of human capital than nearby, comparable Indian cities. It has&#13;
traditionally been a magnet for seekers of economic opportunity, including the entrepreneurial&#13;
Naidu community, whose members formed many of todayâ&#128;&#153;s successful firms in Coimbatore.&#13;
&#13;
Known as the â&#128;&#156;Manchester of South Indiaâ&#128;&#157;, Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economy has been closely tied to&#13;
the evolution of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s textile industry. The British introduced cotton growing to the area in&#13;
the 19th century, starting local textile production. Prior to that, Coimbatore (or Kovai, as it used&#13;
to be known) was less a city than a collection of villages. Cotton growing and ginning, and the&#13;
subsequent expansion into other segments of the textile industry, were crucial in the development&#13;
of local know-how and an entrepreneurial class, which was to be important to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s later&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
In the early 20th century, local artisans learned to make spare parts for the imported textile&#13;
machines used in Coimbatore. Over time, as their skills further developed and local demand for&#13;
equipment surged, Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s mechanics learned to produce textile machinery, by reverse-&#13;
engineering imported technologies. Family-owned firms emerged in Coimbatore to produce&#13;
textiles as well as the machines on which to make them. By the time India became independent,&#13;
Coimbatore already had home-grown garment companies and textile machinery producers,&#13;
mostly family owned. Some of them (PSG, Ramakrishna, KG, Lakshmi) are still in business&#13;
today, and over the decades have evolved into diversified conglomerates involved in everything&#13;
from textiles to mechanical engineering to IT to real estate development. Although Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 73&#13;
&amp;#12;textile industry is now centered on nearby Tirupur37, key functions like product design,&#13;
management, training, and textile machinery production are still based in Coimbatore.&#13;
&#13;
Geography strongly influenced Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s early development. Climatologically,&#13;
Coimbatore sits in a â&#128;&#156;rain shadowâ&#128;&#157;, without much direct precipitation, as most weather fronts&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t make it over the Western Ghats mountain range lying between the city and Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s west&#13;
coast. Water-intensive cultivation of cotton therefore needs much irrigation, for which motor&#13;
pumps are used to bring groundwater up to the surface. Already prior to independence,&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s makers of textile machinery diversified into producing motor pumps, later at one&#13;
point accounting for 80% of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s closed market. In subsequent decades, these local producers&#13;
further diversified into related industry segments like pressure valves, precision measurement,&#13;
and process control equipment. All this played a critically important, enabling role in the early&#13;
development of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic and skills base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37&#13;
  While Tirupur was administratively part of Coimbatore during the period studied, its particular history is beyond&#13;
the scope of this case study report.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  74&#13;
&amp;#12;Select Milestones in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s Recent Economic History&#13;
&#13;
Another side development of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s early industrialization has been the&#13;
establishment of independent charitable trusts and non-profit foundations by Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
family-owned engineering firms. Legally, these entities have an armâ&#128;&#153;s length relationships with&#13;
the businesses that founded them, and have focused on funding numerous technical colleges,&#13;
schools, hospitals, and clinics in Coimbatore. But in practice, these relationships are very close&#13;
and collaborative: the for-profit firms provide scholarships, apprenticeships, and training for&#13;
students from their respective affiliated educational institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This last element is proving to be a key competitive advantage for the city, and likely a&#13;
crucial enabler of its economic success, as will be shown later. Today Coimbatore has higher&#13;
human development indicators than Tamil Nadu and India as a whole, particularly in terms of&#13;
educational attainment and technical skills. Importantly, much of the instruction in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
institutions of higher learning is in English, giving its workforce and edge over workers in other&#13;
cities who may have primarily been educated in the local Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, or Telugu&#13;
languages, for example.&#13;
&#13;
While local government was not driving Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic development, it has played&#13;
a vital enabling role for the cityâ&#128;&#153;s success, through the delivery of essential public goods.&#13;
Although this report will note that the Coimbatore governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role has generally been limited&#13;
with regards to proactive economic development initiatives at the local level, Coimbatore city&#13;
was distinguished as the â&#128;&#156;Best Corporationâ&#128;&#157; within Tamil Nadu state for its provision of physical&#13;
infrastructure, and municipal capacity.38 The award recognized Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s excellent&#13;
performance on roads, education, health, solid waste management and tax collection.39 An&#13;
Indian firm (headquartered in Mumbai) that chose to locate in Coimbatore, while noting that&#13;
roads were generally superior in South India, particularly distinguished Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s transport&#13;
connectivity, ICT infrastructure and advanced support infrastructure (healthcare and education).&#13;
In particular, Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s good connectivity to business hubs including Chennai, Bangalore,&#13;
Delhi, and Mumbai was considered a particular advantage of the city.40 Partly this is due to&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s geographic location, but mostly due to its road, rail, and air infrastructure.&#13;

&amp;#12;Key Local Actors&#13;
&#13;
Private sector leading the way. The Coimbatore Chamber of Commerce and the cityâ&#128;&#153;s industry&#13;
associations are the de facto leaders of economic development, through facilitating interaction on&#13;
finding market segment opportunities between member firms and industries, strengthening&#13;
access and ties to national and international markets, and representing local firmsâ&#128;&#153; interests to the&#13;
city, state and central government. While member firms compete with one another, they also find&#13;
opportunities to cooperate, both because they are not direct competitors in certain market&#13;
segments, and for the general good of Coimbatore.&#13;
&#13;
Indian Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry Coimbatore (ICCI) was founded in 1929 by&#13;
independent Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s first finance minister, who was originally from Coimbatore. Today the&#13;
Indian Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry in Coimbatore includes 1,600 members and 90&#13;
affiliated organizations. The Chamber is registered as a society, and maintains the broad&#13;
objective of supporting the Coimbatore regionâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. It seeks to promote and&#13;
develop business in Coimbatore through pursuing improvements in infrastructure, amenities and&#13;
services. It does this through regular meetings and exchanges with government bodies, and by&#13;
increasing access for its members to national and international markets.41 In addition to meeting&#13;
and lobbying relevant government bodies, the Chamber conducts meetings and seminars with its&#13;
members on industry-related issues and concerns.42&#13;
&#13;
The Chamber, as an association, and â&#128;&#156;association of associationsâ&#128;&#157;, led the â&#128;&#156;One Voice for&#13;
Kovaiâ&#128;&#153;s 10 Point Agendaâ&#128;&#157;43 initiative, articulating 10 infrastructure projects which they&#13;
considered as being urgently needed by the city region. The agenda is directed at both the state&#13;
and central government. Specific project proposals in the document include:&#13;
&#13;
     1. Roads â&#128;&#147; creating outer and intermediate ring roads, providing rail over bridges and bus&#13;
        and truck terminals, and other general road infrastructure improvements;&#13;
     2. Coimbatore Urban Development Authority &amp; Master Plan â&#128;&#147; forming a development&#13;
        authority for the metropolitan area, as well as updating the Master Plan from 1994;&#13;
     3. Housing &amp; Water for Slums â&#128;&#147; providing housing and physical infrastructure (including&#13;
        water supply, sewage, drainage and traffic management) for over 20,000 households&#13;
        living in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s 200 slums;&#13;
     4. Railway â&#128;&#147; doubling tracks, adding railway brides and commuter trains, and developing&#13;
        stations;&#13;

(SSI) membership. CODISSIA represents Coimbatore entrepreneurs at all advisory and&#13;
grievance panels for SSIs, and conducts seminars, training programs, exhibitions and trade fairs&#13;
for its members. CODISSIA set up a permanent trade fair complex in Coimbatore, only the&#13;
second such facility in the country after the one in New Delhi, and hosts annual trade fairs for&#13;
several of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s industries. Lastly, CODISSIA has existing MOUs with Coimbatore area&#13;
technology and engineering colleges and polytechnics, as well as with manufacturers&#13;
associations within India and abroad.44&#13;
&#13;
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is a national level body representing industry and&#13;
primarily larger firms.45 Similar to the previous associations mentioned, it plays a lobbying role&#13;
to the government and conducts regular meetings and seminars with its members.46 CII was&#13;
noted in the mission interview meetings as being a representative to the government of the larger&#13;
conglomerates. In the case of Bosch locating to Coimbatore, for example, Bosch first contacted&#13;
CII to enquire about relocating to the region.47&#13;

Coimbatore Industrial Infrastructure Association (COINDIA) was created by this&#13;
engineering industry association (SIEMA) in 2005, to serve the pump, motor and foundry cluster&#13;
within the engineering sector. COINDIA acts as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and provides&#13;
common physical infrastructure and research facilities for its cluster of industrial firms. It is a&#13;
recipient of both national and state government funding.49&#13;
&#13;
SIEMA, CODISSIA, and the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) were influential in&#13;
the creation of the Small Industries Testing and Research Centre (SITARC) in 1986 for&#13;
testing, training and development, and research in motors and pumps. SITARC is funded by the&#13;
national and state government of India, as well as by IDBI and UNDP.50&#13;
&#13;
South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) is a private autonomous research&#13;
organization supported by the Ministry of Textiles of India. The organization provides technical&#13;
assistance on management knowhow, labor training, and cost and economic issues. SITRA&#13;
provides labor training through the Integrated Skill Development Scheme and provides product&#13;
testing facilities to test such things as yarn and fabric. It currently has approximately 65 patents,&#13;
and applies for government funding for research based on the industry needs and as a result of&#13;
regular consultation with textile industry firms. Lastly, in recognizing the industry trend of&#13;
moving from traditional to â&#128;&#156;technicalâ&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;functionalâ&#128;&#157; textiles, SITRA has created Centers of&#13;
Excellence to facilitate the diversification of the industry into these new segments.51&#13;

The Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation (CCMC) is the administrative government&#13;
structure of Coimbatore city,52 but not of the wider urban agglomeration or metropolitan area.&#13;
The wider area is governed by the Coimbatore District Administration, which is led by the state&#13;
government appointed District Collector, a career civil servant. The District Collector provides a&#13;
supervisory role over the CCMC. While Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s city government has a mayor and&#13;
municipal council, the state government-appointed municipal commissioner serves as the chief&#13;
executive. The CCMC has a very limited role in economic development. In broad terms, the&#13;
municipal corporationâ&#128;&#153;s role is in planning and land use management, urban infrastructure, social&#13;
infrastructure, the urban environment, heritage, and tourism.53 In terms of state and national&#13;
level incentive schemes for firms, these are usually leveraged by the firms themselves, either&#13;
through the industry or business associations mentioned above, or through direct cooperation&#13;
with representatives of higher tiers of government with local offices in Coimbatore.&#13;
&#13;
Universities&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore has a nationwide reputation for being an educational and industrial center,&#13;
with over 150 arts and sciences colleges and about 60 engineering colleges.54 The city is&#13;
particularly known for its engineering colleges, most of which have strong links to local&#13;
engineering and manufacturing firms. The founding of several engineering colleges and&#13;
polytechnics by private, family-owned firms helped fulfill an industry needâ&#128;&#148;creating and&#13;
sustaining a workforce meeting industry requirements and ensuring continuous innovationâ&#128;&#148;as&#13;
well as supported the greater goal of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s growth and prosperity. The relatively high&#13;
number of engineering universities, colleges and polytechnics, which maintain close ties to the&#13;
industry, has continuously provided Coimbatore with a high quality workforce. This has&#13;
contributed to Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s organic growth over the years and, more recently, has provided a&#13;
significant part of its value proposition to Indian or multinational firms choosing to locate or do&#13;
business in the city.&#13;

in terms of education attainment within India. The main colleges and universities are: the&#13;
Government College of Technology, PSG College of Technology (the PSG trust colleges also&#13;
include the PSG College of Arts and Sciences, the PSG Institute of Management and others, and&#13;
are affiliated with Anna University), the Coimbatore Institute of Technology, and universities&#13;
including Bharathiar University, Anna University, and Amrita University.55 In addition to these,&#13;
there are a number of industry research institutes such as SITARC for motors and pumps and&#13;
SITRA for textile research, as well as other institutes like the Institute for Forest Genetics and&#13;
Tree breeding, the Indian Council for Forestry Research &amp; Education, and the Tamil Nadu&#13;
institute of Urban Studies.&#13;
&#13;
SEZs in Coimbatore&#13;
&#13;
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were found to play an important role in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
growth from 2007-2012, helping to attract MNCs as well as firms already operating in&#13;
Coimbatore that were looking to lower operating costs. With their establishment endorsed by&#13;
national law in 2005, and followed up by a Tamil Nadu state act in the same year, there are now&#13;
two SEZs in Coimbatore: CHIL, a private initiative; and TIDEL Park Coimbatore, a government&#13;
venture. As of 2014, six additional private initiative SEZs are in planning for Coimbatore.56&#13;
Currently, CHIL and TIDEL Park are home to firms specializing in IT and IT-enabled services,&#13;
BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), engineering and design services, and automotive R&amp;D.&#13;
Interviews with both CHIL and TIDEL Park officials suggest that they were created at&#13;
approximately the same time, with CHIL being the first to begin operations.&#13;
&#13;
However, SEZs have had mixed results throughout India.57 Only about 20 percent of&#13;
approved SEZs in the country have become operational (124 from a formally approved 580).&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s advantage may derive from being located in Tamil Nadu, and benefitting from the&#13;
respective enabling conditions. State actions with regards to SEZs have been critical, often&#13;
determining the success or failure of SEZ policy on issues such as land acquisition, for example.&#13;
SEZ success has depended upon the interest of host state governments to establish them, state&#13;
government capacity to act effectively in providing necessary SEZ conditions and solving&#13;
&#13;

   Other educational institutions include K.G. group colleges (the Institute of Health Sciences, KGISL Institute of&#13;
Information Management. KGISL Institute of Technology, KG College of Arts &amp; Science), GD Naidu College,&#13;
Coimbatore Medical College, Coimbatore Law College, the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Karpagam&#13;

   Saleman and Jordan, The Implementation of Industrial Parks. Some Lessons Learned in India. (See Annex 3:&#13;
Learning from SEZs).&#13;
                                                                                                                80&#13;
&amp;#12;problems, and the willingness of citizens to go along with the policy. SEZs in southern Indian&#13;
states performed relatively well, and there is extreme diversity between states in India in SEZ&#13;
performance.58 Explaining the particular success of Coimbatore SEZs requires further study&#13;
beyond the scope of this report.&#13;
&#13;
CHIL was established as a speculative private-sector investment. The SEZ was started by&#13;
KGiSL group, a conglomerate offering IT, ITES services, BPO services, and higher education,59&#13;
who recognized the opportunity for spillover growth from MNCs looking to move into Tier-1&#13;
cities. KGiSL promoted investment in Coimbatore, bought the land plots to eventually form the&#13;
SEZ, and built the facilities and physical infrastructureâ&#128;&#148;commercial offices, roads, and&#13;
eventually residential housing for the SEZ employees. While this will be detailed later in the&#13;
report, KGiSL attracted Cognizant, Dell, and Bosch to its SEZ, amassing 20,000 total jobs60&#13;
since 2006. Cognizant, which currently employs 10,000 in Coimbatore, is looking to add space&#13;
to accommodate up to 60,000 employees in the next 3-5 years.61&#13;
&#13;
TIDEL Park was created as a joint venture of public enterprises TIDCO and ELCOT,&#13;
mainly for IT and ITES. TIDEL Park Coimbatore succeeded the initial TIDEL Park in Chennai,&#13;
which was reported as having employed close to 33,000.62 The Coimbatore SEZ features firms&#13;
such as Bosch (Bosch has operations in both CHIL and TIDEL), which employs about 1,000 at&#13;
the park, and Cameron, which employs 50063. Bosch operates IT and ITES out of the TIDEL&#13;
Park SEZ, whereas Cameron, headquartered in Houston, provides engineering and design&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
There is little evidence of clustering effects, significant knowledge spillovers, or other&#13;
substantive linkages between firms in SEZ and the cityâ&#128;&#153;s broader economy. SEZs in&#13;
Coimbatore appear to have contributed significantly to job growth in the city in the period&#13;
studied, attracting firms with incentives, the provision of common infrastructure, customs and&#13;
excise duty exemptions, as well as tax exemptions. However, the findings suggest that there are&#13;
very limited linkages between the MNCs within either SEZâ&#128;&#148;a lack of both knowledge sharing&#13;

   KGiSL manages four privately-owned colleges.&#13;
60&#13;
   Of the 20,000 jobs, 10,000 are from Cognizant, 5,000 from Bosch and the rest from Dell, KGiSL and other firms.&#13;

&amp;#12;and staff migration. In addition, MNCs report very limited linkages to the local economy, apart&#13;
from almost entirely employing local Coimbatoreans. So while the economic benefits are&#13;
apparent with the extensive job creation, the longer-term effects on the local economyâ&#128;&#148;which&#13;
would be facilitated by linkages to local firmsâ&#128;&#148;appear to be limited. Within CHIL, the firms&#13;
reported having agreed not to pouch either otherâ&#128;&#153;s employees, negating the potential positive&#13;
effects of staff migration, shared experience, and learning. Faced with insufficient electricity and&#13;
physical infrastructure elsewhere, firms seemed to co-locate within the SEZs simply for the&#13;
convenience and savings from cost-sharing of common infrastructure. Clustering is not helped&#13;
by the fact that the foreign firms in the SEZ are sometimes in seemingly unrelated industries (e.g.&#13;
automotive R&amp;D or IT call centers).&#13;

&amp;#12;Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Factors of Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the Executive Summary, the two main themes of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s recent economic&#13;
success have been the growth of its indigenous engineering cluster, and the upsurge of inward&#13;
investment by multinational firms, as well as a few large companies from other parts of India.&#13;
More specifically, the principal factors of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic success could be summarized&#13;
as follows:&#13;
&#13;
     1.   Private-Sector Led Development.&#13;
     2.   Supportive Ecosystem&#13;
     3.   Quality Workforce&#13;
     4.   Responsiveness to Market Opportunities&#13;
     5.   Bottom-Line Business Advantages&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Below is a closer look at each factor.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 1: Private-Sector Led Development&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore has a highly entrepreneurial, engaged, socially conscious private sector, which&#13;
has been the driving force behind its recent economic success. The local governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role&#13;
has largely focused on the provision of enabling infrastructure, while the national and state&#13;
governments have provided investment incentives, as well as constructed one SEZ (Tidel Park)&#13;
to attract outside investors. These incentives and schemes from the higher tiers of government&#13;
are leveraged by the private sector groups, or particular firms. It was noted in several interviews&#13;
that Coimbatore lacks a â&#128;&#156;political championâ&#128;&#157;, necessary to both utilize such schemes and&#13;
pressure higher tiers of government for more support.64&#13;
&#13;
Private-sector led economic growth in Coimbatore over the past decade has had two&#13;
principal aspects â&#128;&#147; growth of the indigenous engineering industry cluster, and attraction of&#13;
outside investors to the city. The focus here is on the formation and growth of indigenous&#13;
manufacturers, while he latter will be covered in the section on Responsiveness to Market&#13;
Opportunities.&#13;
&#13;

  In person interview with Mr. Jayamurali, Vice President â&#128;&#147; Corporate Relations, KG Information Systems Private&#13;
Limited, KGiSL, on June 11, 2014; 34. In person interview with Mr. C.V. Sankar, Principal Secretary, Industries&#13;
Department, Government of Tamil Nadu, on June 20, 2014.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            83&#13;
&amp;#12;SMEs are a central part of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s success story. While there are a few local diversified&#13;
conglomerates that also have engineering arms, the vast majority of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s engineering&#13;
firms are family-owned SMEs, on average employing 50 to 100 workers, and with only about 10&#13;
to 15 customers. Individual industry segments include foundries, pumps, valves, compressors,&#13;
electric motors, precision instruments, process control equipment, automotive components,&#13;
gearing, grinders, and food and textile machinery. The common thread of all these industries is&#13;
that they are heavily reliant on engineering skills and know-how, with a high degree of&#13;
transferability of practical knowledge from one engineering industry segment to another.&#13;
&#13;
Path dependency has influenced the cityâ&#128;&#153;s industrial growth, but is in itself not a sufficient&#13;
explanation for the economic outcomes observed. As noted earlier, the growth of&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s textile industry played a crucial role in the early development of its economic and&#13;
skills base. This provided a foundation of engineering and corporate know-how in the city,&#13;
paving the way for the later diversification into related industry segments like pumps and valves,&#13;
which remain important to this day. Crucially, the accumulation of industry expertise and overall&#13;
business acumen sets Coimbatore apart from many cities with a similar industrial history.&#13;
&#13;
The city has built on its inherited strengths, and used them as a springboard to developing&#13;
new ones. Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s traditional strength has been its foundries â&#128;&#147; metal castings&#13;
manufacturers, which by some estimates today employ as many as 150,000 people in the city and&#13;
its environs. This expertise is critical to everything from producing industrial machinery to auto&#13;
manufacturing to components for aircraft engines, and Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s firms have earned a&#13;
national and international reputation for quality metal products at competitive prices. Metal&#13;
works are a mainstay of the local economy, and have provided a good career entry point for&#13;
workers without a college education, as well as for highly-skilled mechanical engineers.&#13;
&#13;
Elements of diversification. So why and how have the cityâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturers been so successful&#13;
at diversifying from making textile machinery (which is still produced in Coimbatore) into&#13;
related, often higher value-added industries? This process has had a number of elements:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   This industry diversification has usually been into closely related industry segments, e.g.&#13;
         from manufacturing pumps to making pressure valves65&#13;
     â&#128;¢   The transferability of specialized skills and know-how between industry segments has&#13;
         been very high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
65&#13;
  Lakshmi Machine Works, initially specialized in machinery for textile spinning, set up a foundry in cooperation&#13;
with a German firm, began producing castings and eventually moved into the aerospace business. The conglomerate,&#13;
Lakhsmi Group, also runs schools, colleges and a hospital (In person interview with Mr. Rajendran, Director of&#13;
Finance, Lakshmi Machine Works Limited (LMW), on June 9, 2014).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              84&#13;
&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   Related technologies with multiple applications (e.g. metal casting can be used in a&#13;
       variety of industries, even if they do not seem similar on the surface)&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Entrepreneurialism within companies, whereby an engineer (often the ownerâ&#128;&#153;s son, for&#13;
       example) decides to make his mark by launching a new product line or innovating in&#13;
       some other way, helping the company heâ&#128;&#153;s in enter new markets&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Starting new firms, whereby an engineer decides to leave an employer go into business&#13;
       for himself, manufacturing an engineering product&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Capital access, either from own sources (e.g. by selling family land which had greatly&#13;
       appreciated in value), or from external sources (usually from commercial banks, with or&#13;
       without government capital subsidies)&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Cluster development to both share costs on common infrastructure, and enhance industry&#13;
       segment linkages and knowledge sharing&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Entrepreneurial support and training, provided by industry associations or government&#13;
       (DIC or MSME)&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Knowledge exchange within industry guilds and associations, including regular monthly&#13;
       meetings and workshops&#13;
   â&#128;¢   The international reputation of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturers for quality and precision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to advancing local economic development through their own business activities,&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s for-profit firms have acted as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s main boosters and promoters. For&#13;
example, private real estate developers have worked to attract multinationals to invest in&#13;
Coimbatore, while the Chamber of Commerce and similar groups promote the city as a place to&#13;
do business through their publications, events, and inbound/outbound business development&#13;
missions.&#13;
&#13;
An engaged private sector. Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s family engineering firms have established technical&#13;
colleges, schools, hospitals, etc. through corporate trusts/foundations, maintaining collaborative&#13;
relationships and mutually-beneficial training arrangements. This has been a key success factor â&#128;&#147;&#13;
more on this in the reportâ&#128;&#153;s Workforce section.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 2: Supportive Ecosystem&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore offers an environment highly conducive to company formation and growth,&#13;
with its plethora of industry associations, educational and training facilities, trade fairs, existing&#13;
agglomerations of companies, technological and organizational know-how, and a deep&#13;
specialized labor pool. This has most notably been the case in engineering-related industries, but&#13;
others as well. Existing companies have been scaling up operations in response to business&#13;
opportunities, while many new firms have been started by ambitious local entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   85&#13;
&amp;#12;Industry associations like ICCI, CODISSIA, SIEMA, and others help cluster development&#13;
through knowledge sharing, entrepreneurial training, ensuring common quality standards,&#13;
organizing business development events, and leveraging government programs, among other&#13;
things. Based on healthy co-opetition among their member firms, these associations help build&#13;
local capacity within their respective industries, and recognize opportunities for industry&#13;
diversification and growth. In addition, the associations act as advocates for the city and its&#13;
business community at the state and national levels.&#13;
&#13;
Given metro Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s modest size (about 2 million people), informal relationships and&#13;
networks are both extensive and highly effective. Economic development stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; paths&#13;
cross on an almost daily basis, with many companies and the executives in them belonging to&#13;
multiple local guilds and associations. Cross-membership makes the associationsâ&#128;&#153; joint&#13;
initiatives more effective, and facilitates coordination among them. Some examples include:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   One Voice for Kovaiâ&#128;&#153;s 10 Point Agenda, lobbying for infrastructure upgrades&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Partnering with national government agencies on technology upgradation, quality&#13;
       certification &amp; skills&#13;
   â&#128;¢   SIEMA and CODISSIA, with government and donor funding, setting up SITARC for&#13;
       testing, training and development, and research in motors and pumps&#13;
   â&#128;¢   CODISSIA coaching new entrepreneurs and advising its members on taxes, licensing,&#13;
       and exporting; conducting seminars, training programs, exhibitions and trade fairs, and&#13;
       establishing Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s permanent trade fair complex.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   COINDIA, set up as a special purpose vehicle providing common physical infrastructure&#13;
       and research facilities for firms in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s pump, motor and foundry cluster, was&#13;
       founded by SIEMA with support from state and central government funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 3: Quality Workforce&#13;
&#13;
The quality of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s workforce has, by all accounts, been one of the critical factors&#13;
behind its economic success in recent years. Home-grown firms have expanded based on the&#13;
ability to tap into local talent, while outside investors have been drawn to Coimbatore precisely&#13;
because they are able to hire high-caliber graduates at very attractive compensation rates.&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s workforce quality is the result both of a highly-effective local educational system,&#13;
and a somewhat unique approach to enhancing the employability of graduates.&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s educational success is above all the story of excellence in various engineering&#13;
fields, particularly mechanical, electrical, electronics, ICT, and materials science, as well as&#13;
more fundamental scientific disciplines like physics and mathematics. Renowned throughout&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              86&#13;
&amp;#12;India as a center for engineering,66 Coimbatore technical schoolsâ&#128;&#153; annual output of new&#13;
engineers is on a par with that of much larger Indian cities like Pune. The majority of these&#13;
engineers have highly specialized, applied technical skills, and are readily employable. Some&#13;
highlights:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   10 universities in Coimbatore&#13;
     â&#128;¢   60 engineering colleges, producing engineers and managers&#13;
     â&#128;¢   30 polytechnics and industry training schools/institutes, preparing graduates for careers&#13;
         such as shop supervisors and machine operators&#13;
     â&#128;¢   â&#128;&#156;150,000 employable graduates every yearâ&#128;&#157;, according to KGiSL officials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s technical schools are considered not just among the best in India, but also&#13;
internationally competitive. Alumni of educational institutions based in Coimbatore can be&#13;
found at most major Indian firms, as well as many multinationals around India and abroad â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
66&#13;
   Tamil Nadu doubled its amount of private engineering colleges in the period 1999-2005, with over 240 colleges&#13;
by 2005â&#128;&#148;20 percent of the total number of such institutions in India. It was reported, however, that most of the&#13;
statesâ&#128;&#153; leading firms attract students from a fairly small number of institutions in Tamil Nadu, in and around&#13;
Chennai and notably in Coimbatore. See: Fuller and Narashmian, Engineering Colleges, â&#128;&#156;Exposureâ&#128;&#157; and&#13;
Information Technology, pp. 258-259.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             87&#13;
&amp;#12;often in very senior positions. This extensive alumni network has undoubtedly played a role in&#13;
the recruitment of companies to Coimbatore.67&#13;
&#13;
Another element in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s development of a specialized labor pool with advanced&#13;
engineering skills has been its historically strong linkages between private businesses and&#13;
educational institutions. As noted earlier, many of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s technical colleges were originally&#13;
founded by family-owned local engineering firms, or their public trusts. While there is legally an&#13;
armsâ&#128;&#153; length relationship between the schools and the companies that established them, there are&#13;
MOUs between them regulating their still-close everyday relations and specifying the nature of&#13;
the companiesâ&#128;&#153; involvement in the schoolsâ&#128;&#153; planning and operations.&#13;
&#13;
Industry-academia linkages are exceptionally strong, and directly influence curriculum&#13;
development. Despite being corporate-funded, the educational institutions are by law required to&#13;
plow any revenues back into the school, enhancing funding and by extension overall instruction&#13;
quality. The collegesâ&#128;&#153; technical curricula are not just highly practically-oriented, they are&#13;
actually developed in consultation with local for-profit firms, and based on concrete business&#13;
needs. This ensures that the production of engineering talent in Coimbatore be directly relevant&#13;
to the labor market, not just minting graduates for the sake of doing so. This indeed may have set&#13;
Coimbatore apart from other high performing cities in the rest of Tamil Nadu.68&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatore has a highly successful system of vocational training, developed largely by&#13;
local actors. The support provided by companies to (usually affiliated) educational institutions&#13;
also includes the provision of various kinds of practical training to students, enhancing their&#13;
employability upon graduation. For example, there are well-established apprentice schemes (of 1&#13;
to12 monthsâ&#128;&#153; duration), where students spend part of each school day on the shop floor, as well&#13;
as in class. Even for the more theoretical engineering degree programs, students are never far&#13;
removed from actual production, with almost all spending some time in local factories learning&#13;
their particular business. Of course, after graduation many students receive offers from the very&#13;
companies that trained them. This is a win-win for all: graduates get jobs, companies get&#13;
employees whose skills and background are already well-known to them, while the colleges can&#13;
rightly claim very high placement rates for their students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
67&#13;
   According to multiple executives interviewed in June 2014, for example Mr. Venugopal R., Vice President-&#13;
Commercial/Centre Head at Bosch in Coimbatore. The main rationale was that the MNCs already had first-hand&#13;
evidence of Coimbatore graduatesâ&#128;&#153; quality.&#13;
&#13;

  A former vice chancellor of Anna University stated that â&#128;&#156;ninety percent of engineering students [in Tamil Nadu],&#13;
despite possessing adequate knowledge, are still not job-readyâ&#128;&#157;. See: Fuller and Narashmian, Engineering Colleges,&#13;

&amp;#12;Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s technical education programs focus on providing graduates with applied job&#13;
skills. This practical focus of engineering education sets Coimbatore apart from many&#13;
comparably-sized cities in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India (for example, Madurai was&#13;
frequently mentioned in interviews). An enabler of this practical focus is the very fact that&#13;
Coimbatore has a high concentration of local manufacturing facilities to begin with, making it&#13;
much easier for students to spend time in nearby factories than in less manufacturing-intensive&#13;
metropolitan economies.&#13;
&#13;
Quality education is not limited to technical fields; bridge programs help. Beyond&#13;
engineering, Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s liberal arts colleges are judged as â&#128;&#156;satisfactoryâ&#128;&#157; by the investors&#13;
interviewed, though not necessarily better than in other comparable Indian cities. The quality of&#13;
their graduates appears to be adequate for the firmsâ&#128;&#153; basic staffing needs, such as in various call&#13;
center/BPO/ITES functions. For specific staffing needs, private-sector employers/ offshoring&#13;
firms like KGiSL run â&#128;&#156;TechnoCampusâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;bridgeâ&#128;&#157; intensive training programs, and â&#128;&#156;finishing&#13;
schoolsâ&#128;&#157; at their own expense (or with students picking up some of the cost) to make graduates&#13;
more employable. This teaches them skills hard to attain outside the workplace, from good&#13;
customer service practices to problem solving and situational awareness.69&#13;
&#13;
Language. Finally, one of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s additional competitive advantages â&#128;&#147; reportedly an&#13;
important factor in guiding MNCsâ&#128;&#153; investment decisions â&#128;&#147; is the prevalence of English as the&#13;
main language of instruction in its educational institutions, regardless of field of study. This&#13;
makes it much easier for multinationals to employ local graduates, and is another area where&#13;
Coimbatore fares better than many other cities in the state. And as native speakers of Tamil,&#13;
Telugu, or some other local language, workers are less likely to move away from Coimbatore to&#13;
other parts of India where the main language is Hindi, resulting in higher worker retention rates.&#13;

   Tholons defines finishing schools as â&#128;&#156;non-formal institutions designed for short-term training programs and&#13;
aimed at training the relevant labor pool segment â&#128;&#147; particularly fresh graduates â&#128;&#147; for specialized industries to&#13;
prepare them for gainful employment. The overall goal of finishing schools is to increase the capacity of the location&#13;
in supplying the necessary amount of labor for an industry by addressing the individualâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to have and&#13;
maintain a fulfilling career. Finishing Schools offer industry-specific training courses encompassing technical skills&#13;
and soft skills. Technical skills are the specific skills sets required in an IT-BPO service line. Soft skills are those&#13;
which should be ensured in the labor pool across all IT-BPO service lines. These common skills are not only used in&#13;
the IT-BPO space, but also applied in other professions. Such skills are not consciously included as target skills&#13;
areas in formal academic institutions.â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; Finishing Schools for the IT-BPO Industry, Tholons whitepaper, Dec 2012.&#13;

&amp;#12;Factor 4: Responsiveness to Market Opportunities&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s private-sector actors have been highly adept at seizing upon opportunities&#13;
presented by the dynamic, ever-shifting marketplace. The private sector has also capitalized&#13;
on Tamil Naduâ&#128;&#153;s aggressive investment promotion policy, led by the Guidance Bureau, aiming&#13;
to attract automotive MNCs to the state. This is again essentially a two-dimensional story, driven&#13;
by two seemingly unrelated sets of external developments:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Multinational firmsâ&#128;&#153; quest for alternatives to sites in Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Tier-1 cities70; and&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Growth of the auto industry in Chennai, creating a need for sourcing components locally.&#13;
&#13;
State-level investment-attraction efforts have benefited Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economy, sometimes&#13;
in indirect ways. Since the 1990s, the State of Tamil Nadu has targeted global â&#128;&#156;marqueeâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
manufacturing names working on the â&#128;&#156;parent-childâ&#128;&#157; model: attract an anchor investor like Ford&#13;
or Hyundai, and dozens of parts suppliers (producers of intermediate inputs) will follow them&#13;
into the state. This is indeed what has happened, with the Chennai area in particular attracting a&#13;
virtual â&#128;&#156;whoâ&#128;&#153;s whoâ&#128;&#157; of the automotive world, including not just Hyundai and Ford, but also&#13;
Mitsubishi, BMW, Daimler Benz, Renault/Nissan, and Caterpillar. Yet the â&#128;&#156;majorsâ&#128;&#157;, as they are&#13;
sometimes called, also wanted to diversify their supplier sources and squeeze out further&#13;
efficiencies from their supply chains by sourcing as many components as they can from local&#13;
firms in India. The Chennai area, and much of the rest of Tamil Nadu for that matter, simply did&#13;
not have enough such firms with the product capabilities and technical know-how to supply the&#13;
OEMs.&#13;
&#13;
Global automakersâ&#128;&#153; arrival in Chennai in the 2000s presented a unique, historic&#13;
opportunity for Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s engineering firms. Some manufacturers in Coimbatore already&#13;
had long-standing relationships with Indian automakers like Ashok-Leyland, Tata Motors, or&#13;
Mahindra. Now they had the chance to supply the likes of Ford or Nissan. According to the&#13;
industrialists interviewed, it was the representatives of the auto firms seeking suppliers that first&#13;
approached local business associations in Coimbatore to try to identify their members which&#13;
could manufacture automotive components like transmission casings, diesel engines, fuel&#13;
pumps, air compressors, or speedometers. Ever the entrepreneurs, the Coimbatoreans rose to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
70&#13;
   â&#128;&#156;Establishing service delivery centers in Tier II locations has become one of the most prominent trends for most&#13;
global IT-BPO service providersâ&#128;&#153; expansion activities. These service providers are pushed to search for alternative&#13;
locations outside of hectic central business districts for different reasons such as high costs, labor pool saturation,&#13;
and high amounts of competition among others.â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; Tier II Locations in the Outsourcing Industry, Tholons, May&#13;
2014. Tholons identifies cost savings, access to new labor pools, less competition, and incentives among the motives&#13;
driving companies to expand in Tier-2 cities.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   90&#13;
&amp;#12;occasion and gradually became integrated into the majorsâ&#128;&#153; global supply chains, eventually&#13;
supplying far-flung parts of their automotive empires even beyond India itself.71&#13;
&#13;
While the opportunity in this case was external (OEMs approaching Coimbatore firms),&#13;
the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business community was quick to seize upon it. They were highly responsive, and&#13;
willing to venture into lines of production that may have been somewhat different to what they&#13;
were used to, but related enough in technical and functional terms that the production scale-up&#13;
and shift could happen. Though no firm data are available on the volume and value of&#13;
automotive shipments out of Coimbatore (in part to protect the confidentiality of existing&#13;
supplier relationships), local manufacturers interviewed state that the number of jobs supported&#13;
by this additional business runs â&#128;&#156;in the thousandsâ&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; not insignificant for a modestly-sized metro&#13;
like Coimbatore.&#13;
&#13;
Capturing spillover growth. The other major external trend on which Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s private&#13;
sector managed to capitalize so spectacularly was the increased saturation, congestion, and costs&#13;
in Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Tier-1 cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai. Following the Y2K-&#13;
driven IT boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, ever more Western companies were looking to&#13;
establish or expand their presence in India; the fact that Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy continued growing right&#13;
through the global Great Recession meant that the domestic Indian market, too, was looking&#13;
increasingly attractive to MNCs. But advanced business facilities with suitable infrastructure&#13;
were becoming increasingly scarce and pricey in the Tier-1 cities. Wage levels were ascendant&#13;
while workforce retention rates plummeted, and any firm wanting to put up a new facility hiring&#13;
several thousand Indian workers faced an uphill struggle.&#13;
&#13;
This is where a home-grown Coimbatore company, KGiSL, saw a stellar market opportunity.&#13;
Pursuing its own commercial interests, KGiSL managed to recruit several MNCs to Coimbatore,&#13;
resulting in major economic benefits to the city and its residents. KGiSL is the real estate&#13;
development and services offshoring arm of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s KG Group conglomerate, a company&#13;
founded before Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s independence, which like so many other local firms got its start in the&#13;
textile industry. KG still makes textiles today, but it has since diversified into everything from IT&#13;
services and HR consulting into real estate, healthcare, education and even water desalination.&#13;
KGiSL had already done some outsourced work for U.S. firms in the late 1990s (medical&#13;
transcription), on a campus originally built as a nursing school, and correctly understood that&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                                               91&#13;
&amp;#12;more corporate functions were likely to be offshored to lower-cost countries like India. Seeking&#13;
new business opportunities in the mid-2000s, the company decided to put up a new office park as&#13;
a speculative investment.&#13;
&#13;
In launching the project, KGiSL quietly acquired an additional 300 acres of land in the&#13;
Saravanampatti neighborhood, 12 km north of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s city center and about the same&#13;
distance from the cityâ&#128;&#153;s airport, for perhaps less than a tenth of what the same land would be&#13;
worth today.72 The intent was to recruit some MNCs to Coimbatore â&#128;&#147; spillover growth from&#13;
Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s Tier-1 cities. Plan B, if no multinationals could be attracted to the new facility, was to&#13;
turn the site into a teaching hospital, on the logic that â&#128;&#156;real estate is always a good investmentâ&#128;&#157;.73&#13;
&#13;
KGiSL staff undertook an extensive, systematic analysis of market trends and players in the&#13;
offshoring world, and in particular the activities of MNCs in India. They observed that some&#13;
companies had run out of room to grow in places like Bangalore or Chennai, and decided to pitch&#13;
Coimbatore to these firms as a viable alternative, given its highly-educated, English-speaking&#13;
workforce, available at significantly lower cost than in Tier-1 cities. KGiSL would offer them&#13;
brand new, state-of-the-art business facilities at its new CHIL Park, then under construction,&#13;
taking advantage of the national Software Technology Parks (STP) scheme; later the campus was&#13;
expanded under another national scheme, the Special Economic Zones program. The first and so&#13;
far largest MNC to be recruited to CHIL was New Jersey-based Cognizant74, a major player in&#13;
the outsourcing of financial and IT services, and with a longstanding presence in India and Tamil&#13;
Nadu (Chennai). Other well-known corporate names that followed include Dell, Germanyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Robert Bosch, and Japanâ&#128;&#153;s Hirotec, a designer and supplier of assembly line solutions to most of&#13;
the worldâ&#128;&#153;s major automakers.&#13;
&#13;
Proactive economic development can be undertaken by public or private actors, ultimately&#13;
with similar outcomes. Although they were performed by a private for-profit company,&#13;
KGiSLâ&#128;&#153;s actions amounted to a classic economic development/investment promotion function:&#13;
business recruitment based on sound analytics, industry and firm identification and targeting,&#13;
marketing, sales pitch, site selection services, assistance with establishment and operations&#13;
(including local staff recruitment), scale-up/business expansion, and investor aftercare.&#13;
Interestingly, KGiSL got the full support of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s business community, even though&#13;
there were only limited benefits in it for them (and much concern about how the MNCsâ&#128;&#153; arrival&#13;
might presage a war for talent and raise local wage levels, hurting their own profitability).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
72&#13;
   As aforementioned, land acquisition has been one of the key problems faced by SEZs in India.&#13;
73&#13;
   In person interview with Mr. Jayamurali, Vice President â&#128;&#147; Corporate Relations, KG Information Systems Private&#13;
Limited, KGiSL, on June 11, 2014.&#13;
74&#13;
   Cognizant currently has a staff of 10,000 in the CHIL SEZ, and has expansion plans to increase this to as many as&#13;
60,000 over the next few years.&#13;
                                                                                                                 92&#13;
&amp;#12;KGiSL invited representatives from Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s Chamber of Commerce, business associations,&#13;
and leading home-grown companies to dinner with prospective investors, showcasing the&#13;
entrepreneurialism and collaborative spirit in the city. By some accounts, this was an important&#13;
consideration in the MNCsâ&#128;&#153; final decisions to establish operations in Coimbatore.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Example of a Multinational Locating in Coimbatore: Germanyâ&#128;&#153;s Bosch&#13;
&#13;
 Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Limited (RBEI) is the Indian subsidiary of Germanyâ&#128;&#153;s Robert&#13;
 Bosch GmbH, one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s leading engineering firms. RBEI is the largest development center outside of&#13;
 Germany, providing engineering services, design, R&amp;D for automotive embedded systems, IT/ITES (software,&#13;
 support for Java, Microsoft, SAP Process), as well as handling purchasing from local suppliers in India.&#13;
&#13;
 Boschâ&#128;&#153;s operations in India had seen steady growth since the 1990s, so around 2003-04 the company started&#13;
 looking for an alternative site to grow besides its existing presence in Bangalore. Based on dozens of criteria,&#13;
 RBEIâ&#128;&#153;s own research shortlisted Coimbatore, along with Jaipur in Rajasthan and Bhubaneswar in Orissa, as the&#13;
 Tier-2 candidate cities being considered for expansion. RBEI approached local developer KGiSL about suitable&#13;
 facilities in Coimbatore; the timing proved fortuitous, as the new CHIL Park was then under construction. Bosch&#13;
 began its Coimbatore operations in 2006 and quickly grew its local presence, eventually moving into three local&#13;
 greenfield facilities which combined now employ 4,700 staff at both local SEZs (CHIL and Tidel Park). Bosch&#13;
 plans to further expand its local presence in Coimbatore to about 6,000 employees in the near term. KGiSL has&#13;
 helped Bosch with identifying and recruiting skilled staff for its Coimbatore operations.&#13;
&#13;
 RBEI cites the following principal factors in selecting Coimbatore for its expansion:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Proximity to Boschâ&#128;&#153;s existing facilities in Bangalore, and a strategic location for attracting talent from&#13;
          western Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and southern Karnataka&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Dependable supply of engineering talent, with 6 of 10 nationally-renowned colleges of interest to&#13;
          Bosch recruiters located in Coimbatore; a highly practical focus of curricula, and strong linkages to&#13;
          industry&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Quite a few RBEI employees in Bangalore hold degrees from colleges in Coimbatore&#13;
     â&#128;¢    A superior quality of life, and more multicultural than some alternative locations considered&#13;
     â&#128;¢    A highly favorable local ecosystem, in a part of the country known for its engineering prowess&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Existing high-quality supplier base, especially manufacturers of castings and forgings&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Socially conscious, entrepreneurial local companies, competing with one another in a very healthy way&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;tendency to evolve when challenges present themselvesâ&#128;&#157;: e.g. when the city became less&#13;
          competitive in textiles, it diversified into non-textile industries â&#128;&#147; a very appealing trait for Bosch&#13;
&#13;
 RBEI is co-located with other multinational tenants to share SEZ physical infrastructure, but there are no&#13;
 linkages, shared staff or knowledge among them. In that sense, the SEZ are not real clusters, just industrial&#13;
 estates. Bosch does have stronger linkages to local firms outside the SEZs, with its Small Engineering and&#13;
 Design R&amp;D Center and corporate purchasing managers trying to source as many components and samples as&#13;
 they can from local suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   93&#13;
&amp;#12;Factor 5: Competitive Business Climate (Bottom-Line Business Advantages)&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Saturation of Tier I cities has necessitated the growth of Tier II and III cities, which is&#13;
supported by talent pools, sizeable and cheaper land and real estate options, relatively lower&#13;
operating costs and conducive business environments. Prominent Tier II and III cities such as&#13;
Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam, Surat, Vadodara, Indore, Coimbatore,&#13;
Nagpur, Bhopal, Lucknow, Bhubaneswar, and Kochi are witnessing increased interest by&#13;
investors.â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; Shveta Jain, Executive Director, Cushman &amp; Wakefield India&#13;
&#13;
The value proposition â&#128;&#147; getting the most for the investment dollar â&#128;&#147; is gaining importance&#13;
not just between countries, but even within India, as the above quote from industrial real&#13;
estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield shows. Rising total business costs, and especially real estate&#13;
and wage levels, has led many multinationals, including home-grown Indian corporations, to&#13;
seriously consider second-tier cities like Coimbatore for their expansion plans. It is important to&#13;
note that site selection considerations are not just limited to the cost side, but also focus on the&#13;
quality and quantity that can be had at a certain pricing point. Therefore, Coimbatore does indeed&#13;
provide a compelling value proposition for companies, not just low business costs.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to a highly-skilled, largely English-speaking workforce at competitive wage levels&#13;
(examined in-depth in a previous section), Coimbatore also offers the following main bottom-&#13;
line business advantages to companies considering investing or expanding there:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Abundant, inexpensive land for industrial or office use; pre-constructed business facilities&#13;
           such as call centers can be had on regular or 99-year leases, which provides a way around&#13;
           land ownership restrictions prevalent in India.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   A strategic location at the crossroads of southern India, with easy access to both coasts&#13;
           and a catchment area that includes western Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and southern Karnataka&#13;
           states.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Good universities and technical colleges, with a long-standing tradition of collaborating&#13;
           with private, for-profit firms, and the ability (not fully utilized) to carry out R&amp;D.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Reasonably good infrastructure, including an international airport, railroads, highways,&#13;
           water and sewerage, and municipal waste treatment (recognized as a national best&#13;
           practice). The only glaring infrastructure deficiency is the provision of electric power,&#13;
           supplied by a monopolistic SOE, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board; power blackouts&#13;
           have been a challenge throughout the state since 2008, and businesses cope with this by&#13;
           installing their own generators, which adversely affects profitability.75&#13;
       â&#128;¢   An entrepreneurial, business-friendly environment, still dominated by family-owned&#13;
           firms but with an increasing presence of Indian and foreign multinational companies, and&#13;
           a regulatory framework that compares favorably with other cities in its region.&#13;

&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   MNCsâ&#128;&#153; existing business ties to local Coimbatore firms through prior joint ventures or&#13;
       supplier relationships. Indeed, Coimbatore has a well-developed network of suppliers of&#13;
       all sorts of manufactured intermediate goods, with a proven ability to quickly adapt to&#13;
       market opportunities and supply needed inputs.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   A growing local consumer market, with some 3.5 million people residing in Coimbatore&#13;
       District, and many millions more within a short driving distance.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   A fairly mild climate by Indian standards, without many days of extreme temperatures â&#128;&#147;&#13;
       Coimbatore is located in the tropics, but at an elevation of more than 400 meters and&#13;
       fringed by mountains, providing a cooling effect.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   A comparatively good quality of life, including multiple affordable housing options, good&#13;
       schools and hospitals, decent cultural and entertainment options, exemplary public safety,&#13;
       and lower traffic congestion and ambiental pollution than many other Indian cities.&#13;
&#13;
The above advantages have favored both the establishment and growth of indigenous&#13;
companies, and investment in Coimbatore by outside firms, particularly as a viable&#13;
alternative to cities like Bangalore or Hyderabad. Examples of the latter include Bosch,&#13;
Cameron, Hirotec, Denso, Rieter, Ford Global Business Services, Cognizant, Dell, and IBM, as&#13;
well as Indian multinationals like Mumbaiâ&#128;&#153;s Larsen &amp; Toubro, Wipro, and TCS. In many cases,&#13;
MNCsâ&#128;&#153; initial investment was fairly modest, then scaled up as business expanded and they&#13;
gained a higher confidence level in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s ability to provide the workers, inputs, and&#13;
facilities they needed to grow.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons for Other Cities&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic success holds valuable lessons for other cities in South Asia Region&#13;
and elsewhere. Some of its success factors have taken decades to develop and are not easily or&#13;
quickly replicable. Still, some of the enabling conditions in Coimbatore could presumably be&#13;
developed in other cities through proactive policy interventions at the local or regional level,&#13;
regardless of which specific actors undertake them. The most notable learnings include:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Focus on Core Competencies: This may sound like a truism, but the recent history of&#13;
      local economic development initiatives worldwide is littered with examples of cities&#13;
      following fads, attempting to be something they are not by targeting industries for which&#13;
      they do not have even the basic prerequisites â&#128;&#147; in the process often spending vast sums on&#13;
      investment incentives. A city does best when leveraging the assets that it does have,&#13;
      which is precisely what Coimbatore has done, even if it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t part of a grand vision or&#13;
      development strategy devised and/or implemented by the public sector. In Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      case, this has meant capitalizing on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s reputation for engineering excellence and&#13;
      precision manufacturing â&#128;&#147; both for home-grown companies to scale up, and to attract&#13;
      additional inward investment. Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s business leaders did not attempt to create a&#13;
      local industry cluster from scratch, nor attract to the city new industries for which it may&#13;
      not have the necessary prerequisites (e.g. semiconductors, biotechnology, aerospace,&#13;
      financial services, or some other â&#128;&#156;fashionableâ&#128;&#157; sector). Instead, they made a push to&#13;
                                                                                               95&#13;
&amp;#12;        expand in areas where they do excel. Outside investors did not need to be lured by hefty&#13;
        incentives, and in fact report having turned down offers of free land from competing&#13;
        locations in India.76&#13;
&#13;
     2. Facilitate ongoing, continuous sectoral diversification by honing the development of&#13;
        transferrable skills: Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s engineers are renowned for their aptitude in&#13;
        mechanical engineering and metal manufacturing. Whether producing water pumps,&#13;
        valves, or automobile transmissions, the skillsets required are very similar and easily&#13;
        transferrable from one manufacturing industry segment to another. There is a specialized&#13;
        labor pool within a small geographical radius, with shared production inputs, extensive&#13;
        knowledge-sharing, and technological exchange occurring on a daily basis. This has&#13;
        enabled Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s existing firms to branch out into new product lines, and aspiring&#13;
        entrepreneurs to start their own companies. This diversification is the result of individuals&#13;
        and firms pursuing concrete market opportunities, not some grand design to achieve it.&#13;
&#13;
     3. Nurture close, substantive relationships between academia and the private sector:&#13;
        Coimbatore seems unique in Tamil Nadu and India in its very high degree of industry-&#13;
        academia collaboration. Educational curricula are practically-focused and developed in&#13;
        consultation with potential employers, so students graduate with relevant, applied skills&#13;
        and extensive manufacturing shop floor experience, not just theoretical knowledge. In&#13;
        some ways, Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s approach to technical training is reminiscent of Germanyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        system of vocational training â&#128;&#147; another manufacturing-intensive economy whose schools&#13;
        produce talent with highly applied skills. Indeed, this is something that has attracted&#13;
        German engineering giant Bosch, for example, as well as other international firms.&#13;
&#13;
     4. Foster the development of a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem: Easier said than&#13;
        done, but Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s mostly family-owned SMEs (de facto, very much an Indian&#13;
        version of Germanyâ&#128;&#153;s Mittelstand) do not operate in a vacuum. They compete with each&#13;
        other for specific business opportunities, but also band together and self-organize to build&#13;
        capacity, ensure common technical standards, facilitate exports, or lobby the government&#13;
        for infrastructure upgrades, such as the recent expansion/upgrade of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s airport. A&#13;
        critical role in this is played by industry associations such as SIEMA and CODISSIA,&#13;
        which provide very real, hands-on technical assistance to their members, and may be&#13;
        more effective at it than government programs in other countries attempting to&#13;
        accomplish the same. They know their industries and city, understand the competitive&#13;
        pressures of the marketplace, and seek to help one another wherever and however they&#13;
        can. Company executives/owners also see themselves as pillars of their community,&#13;
        whose duty it is to help others along. They volunteer their time and energy to make their&#13;
        respective industries better â&#128;&#147; more modern, more competitive, and better integrated into&#13;
        global supply chains.&#13;

  In person interview with Mr. Venugopal R., Vice President-Commercial/Centre Head-Coimbatore, Bosch, on&#13;
June 16, 2014.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     96&#13;
&amp;#12;     5. Build up and leverage the cityâ&#128;&#153;s human capital as a key competitive asset: Another&#13;
        apparent truism, yet few places seem as aware of people as their greatest resource as&#13;
        Coimbatore is, or as committed to investing in improving it. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s for-profit&#13;
        companies have a long history of highly valuing education, particularly in the natural&#13;
        sciences and applied technologies. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s business community originally established&#13;
        the vast majority of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s technical colleges and vocational schools, both to&#13;
        develop their own talent pipeline and as a way of giving back to their community. More&#13;
        recently, private-sector actors attempting to recruit multinationals to the city have touted&#13;
        Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s human capital as the key competitive advantage over nearby, and otherwise&#13;
        similarly situated cities like Madurai. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that a number of&#13;
        professional Coimbatoreans had lived abroad, still maintaining close ties to their diaspora&#13;
        in other countries.77&#13;
&#13;
     6. Create a virtue out of necessity â&#128;&#147; turn the lack of attention from government into a&#13;
        strength, instead of a competitive disadvantage: Coimbatore has no political&#13;
        champions in Chennai or New Delhi, and has not had any leaders of national stature since&#13;
        Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s early post-independence days. The city does not have a single state-owned&#13;
        enterprise (â&#128;&#156;Public Sector Unitâ&#128;&#157;), yet its economic growth handily outpaces many places&#13;
        that have a lot of them. There is no concerted effort by municipal officials to help local&#13;
        firms and individuals tap into existing national or state support programs for which they&#13;
        may qualify (instead, this was done by industry associations and other private-sector&#13;
        membership groups). Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role has largely focused on the provision of basic&#13;
        infrastructure, public safety, and very limited support such as export promotion or the&#13;
        help MSMEs receive through DICs. Beyond infrastructure provision largely â&#128;&#156;left to its&#13;
        own devicesâ&#128;&#157; economically, Coimbatore shows what the private sector can accomplish&#13;
        on its own initiative, provided some basic services are provided and government does not&#13;
        actively hinder economic activity through suffocating regulation, an onerous tax burden,&#13;
        or barriers to entry, for example. The active role played by its chamber and industry&#13;
        associations is a model for those in other cities where there are at least the contours of a&#13;
        market-based economy (i.e. there is a reasonably well-developed private sector).&#13;

  Tellingly, although Coimbatore itself is a hub for engineering education, several senior executives interviewed by&#13;
the mission had earned their advanced degrees abroad, mostly in the UK or US. It was apparent that they were very&#13;
much in sync with the latest technologies and management thinking in the West, and seemed to be on a par with&#13;
their colleagues in high-income countries. Many also reported having business interests abroad, such as owning&#13;
factories in the United States, or frequently traveling to Japan to meet with joint-venture partners. The overall&#13;
impression was that of extremely savvy, globally-connected entrepreneurs.&#13;

Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s key industries include manufacturing, engineering services, transport,&#13;
IT/ITES/BPO, education, and health. Textile production still has a substantial presence in the&#13;
local economy, but has declined in relative importance in recent years, with much actual&#13;
production moving to neighboring Tiruppur while some functions like product design and&#13;
management have remained in Coimbatore.&#13;

&amp;#12;According to an industry profile of Coimbatore District done by the Ministry of Micro, Small&#13;
and Medium Enterprises,78 most MSME employment in Coimbatore today is in manufacturing,&#13;
followed by textiles, service activities and other smaller industry segments. Manufacturing&#13;
represents 40% of employment among Coimbatore MSMEs (72,000 workers), now employing&#13;
more than textiles, at 26% (50,000 workers), which represent more of the traditional industry in&#13;
Coimbatore.79&#13;

Of the large firms identified in the report, almost all employing 500 or more employees are either&#13;
in the textile or manufacturing sectors. The firm units within Lakshmi Machine Works, a&#13;

Testing of Standardized Research Hypotheses&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the reportâ&#128;&#153;s Introduction, this is the second in a series of case studies of&#13;
economically successful cities around the world. In order to ensure comparability of â&#128;&#156;teachable&#13;
momentsâ&#128;&#157; across all case studies, a set of standardized research hypotheses was tested in&#13;
Coimbatore to determine the exact scope for action at the metropolitan level, factors that may&#13;
have most affected how those prerogatives were used, and the extent to which specific&#13;
interventions (and how they were implemented) may have resulted in the economic outcomes&#13;
observed.&#13;
&#13;
The first hypothesis tested seeks to determine to what extent Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic results&#13;
were attributable to proactively picking sectors to support, the second one looks at the strategic&#13;
planning process itself (if any) and how it may have affected economic growth, and the third one&#13;
looks at the planâ&#128;&#153;s implementation, if applicable.&#13;
&#13;
1.          Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic success is partly attributable to key local actors having made&#13;
            strategic bets on specific industrial initiatives, rather than just making improvements to&#13;
            its general investment climate in order to stimulate economic activity. National, state,&#13;
            and local-level improvements to the business climate have undoubtedly facilitated the&#13;
            achievement of superior economic outcomes, but proactive initiatives on the part of&#13;
            private-sector actors are likely to be the greater part of the reasons for Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
            success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Coimbatore has benefitted from a favorable and improving business climate at the national&#13;
       and state levels, including the dismantling of the erstwhile â&#128;&#156;license rajâ&#128;&#157;, greater openness to&#13;
       external trade and investment, increased market competition, and improving connectivity&#13;
       (telecommunications and transport). At the local level, the municipal and district&#13;
       governments have focused on the provision of critical infrastructure like transport and water&#13;
       &amp; sewerage as enablers of economic development, as well as other, often unnoticed factors&#13;
       like good public safety, which reduces companiesâ&#128;&#153; operating costs. While corruption remains&#13;
       a concern at various levels of government, it does not seem to have materially affected&#13;
       Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s ability to deliver desirable economic outcomes. In addition, the simplification&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
81&#13;
     Ibid, pp. 6-7.&#13;
                                                                                                  100&#13;
&amp;#12;       of procedures (single-window) for entrepreneurs is likely to have aided company formation&#13;
       and growth, and thus employment, at the MSME level.&#13;
&#13;
       In Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s case, there were proactive economic development initiatives visibly&#13;
       contributing to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic success. However, they were undertaken almost&#13;
       exclusively by private-sector actors pursuing profit motives, not city government or a&#13;
       dedicated local economic development agency. To the extent that there is any industry&#13;
       targeting by government, it is all done at the state level.82&#13;
&#13;
       Ingredients of success:&#13;
&#13;
           a. As an economically successful city, Coimbatore has two dominant themes: (i)&#13;
              growth of its indigenous engineering cluster; and, (ii) the attraction of (Indian and&#13;
              foreign) multinational firms to the city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           b. Although not necessarily by design, Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s proactive economic development&#13;
              efforts have been focused on industries producing tradable goods and services,&#13;
              including engineering, metal components and products manufacturing, automotive&#13;
              parts, ICT and ITES, BPO, and industrial design services.&#13;
&#13;
           c. In its proactive economic development activities, Coimbatore has de facto pursued an&#13;
              integrated, three-pronged approach to business development: nurturing the growth&#13;
              of existing firms, fostering the establishment of new start-up companies, and striving&#13;
              to attract new outside investment. Local companies got assistance from government&#13;
              and/or industry associations to establish their businesses, upgrade technologies,&#13;
              expand production, export, and integrate into global supply chains. Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
              business community collaborated to bring new MNC investors into the city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. The likely trajectory of Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance was not altered by any&#13;
   specific policy interventions, nor did the city have a strategic plan for economic&#13;
   development. However, individual private-sector actors have in practice carried out some&#13;
   actions that are typically found in such plans, and would have likely been included had&#13;
   Coimbatore produced such a document. Coimbatore has managed to outpace its national&#13;
   economy even without creating an official strategic plan for economic development. Its&#13;
   principal private-sector actors (the Chamber of Commerce, industry associations, individual&#13;
   firms) did not have a structured approach to economic development, nor did they lay out a&#13;
   strategy as such. Rather, they organically diversified into new industry segments in response&#13;

&amp;#12;to market opportunities and favorable macroeconomic policy, and they worked to attract&#13;
Indian and multinational firms to Coimbatore.&#13;
&#13;
Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic development-related activities have included:&#13;
&#13;
a. Robust analytics to guide corporate decision-making and strategy formulation, based on&#13;
   a knowledge of global business trends and first-hand experience doing business with&#13;
   international companies through offshoring, supplier, or joint venture relationships. These&#13;
   were carried out at the level of the individual firm, rather than for the city as a whole.&#13;
   However, they did result in the recruitment of anchor investors in the engineering and IT&#13;
   fields, helping to put the city on the site selection map and raise its visibility â&#128;&#147; amounting&#13;
   to de facto economic development marketing as well as business recruitment/expansion.&#13;
&#13;
b. No structured or formal planning process to:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ identify key economic development issues facing Coimbatore, such as inadequate&#13;
        infrastructure, lack of access to finance, fairly low export intensity, tough&#13;
        international competition for its principal products, or lack of government&#13;
        transparency and accountability. However, through regular meetings within and&#13;
        among local industry associations and chambers of commerce, the business&#13;
        community did put together a lobbying document, One Voice for Kovaiâ&#128;&#153;s 10 Point&#13;
        Agenda, which mostly focuses on addressing infrastructure deficiencies and is the&#13;
        closest thing Coimbatore has to a strategic plan. This document was the product of&#13;
        ad-hoc discussions between members of more than a hundred business groups and&#13;
        non-governmental organizations, not an organized process.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ identify the cityâ&#128;&#153;s main competitive strengths, such as engineering excellence,&#13;
        good universities and technical colleges, relatively high levels of human capital, a&#13;
        very engaged private sector, highly competitive business costs, good public safety&#13;
        and security, and considerable tourism development potential. Many of these&#13;
        strengths (e.g. Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s reputation in engineering and manufacturing) are&#13;
        simply taken as a given, and not necessarily used as part of any coordinated&#13;
        marketing or business development strategy for the city.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ formulate a vision of progress that Coimbatore can make, including specific&#13;
        measures to address its challenges and to capitalize on its competitive strengths.&#13;
        There is a Vision Tamil Nadu document at the state level, but nothing for the city.&#13;
        More recently (i.e. falling outside the scope of this case studyâ&#128;&#153;s time period), the&#13;
        Municipal Corporation has prepared a new City Development Plan, but it is still in&#13;
        draft form as of June 2014.&#13;
&#13;
c. Coimbatore did not assemble a â&#128;&#156;growth coalitionâ&#128;&#157; as such at the metropolitan level,&#13;
   which would bring together representatives of local government, universities, private-&#13;
   sector businesses, labor unions, and other stakeholders in economic development.&#13;
   However, the Chamber of Commerce and industry associations did join together to&#13;
   prepare the One Voice for Kovaiâ&#128;&#153;s 10 Point Agenda document. There appears to be a&#13;
   strong sense of solidarity and shared purpose among members of the business community&#13;
   in wanting to see their city advance economically, and they have shown an ability and&#13;
                                                                                     102&#13;
&amp;#12;        readiness to gather in pursuit of such goals when needed, e.g. to lobby for infrastructure&#13;
        investments.&#13;
&#13;
     d. Strategic decision-making and prioritization: Coimbatore did not utilize a structured&#13;
        process for identifying and agreeing on policy priorities, nor for evaluating trade-offs&#13;
        between different public investment alternatives, such as through cost-benefit analyses.&#13;
        The Chamber of Commerce and industry associations advocate for specific forms of&#13;
        government support from the state and national governments (e.g. airport expansion or&#13;
        more reliable electric power supply), but this is not based on evaluating the relative&#13;
        merits of one form of support over another.&#13;
&#13;
3. The level of autonomy related to economic development in Coimbatore (the equivalent of&#13;
   the â&#128;&#156;Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s Wedgeâ&#128;&#157;) was not a significant factor in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s improved economic&#13;
   outcomes. Local government bodies in India have a limited role in interventions aimed at&#13;
   fostering economic growth, although they do play an important enabling role through the&#13;
   provision of critical public goods such as infrastructure and public safety. The public&#13;
   sector has not undertaken proactive interventions â&#128;&#147; through plans, strategies, or in practice â&#128;&#147;&#13;
   to spur economic development.&#13;
&#13;
     a. There is no dedicated local economic development agency in Coimbatore, nor an&#13;
        economic development-related department of government. The role of government&#13;
        bodies, particularly the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation and the District&#13;
        Administration, is limited to providing local public goods in physical and support&#13;
        infrastructure. Moreover, there are no economic development agencies at higher tiers of&#13;
        government, apart from the Tamil Nadu Guidance Bureau, which is the state agency for&#13;
        investment promotion.&#13;
&#13;
             a. Low financial and administrative autonomy: Although India initiated a&#13;
                decentralization reform effort under Constitutional Amendment 74, the country is&#13;
                generally characterized by low level of decentralization from national and state&#13;
                government to local government, or urban local bodies.83 The reform effort has&#13;
                witnessed municipal government moving beyond responsibilities in traditional&#13;
                local public goods â&#128;&#147; yet the interview findings do not suggest Coimbatore&#13;
                municipal governmentâ&#128;&#153;s involvement in economic development. Amendment 74&#13;
                outlined that state governments could assign up to 18 government functions to&#13;
                urban local bodies, 16 of which were reportedly transferred to urban local bodies&#13;
                in Tamil Nadu.84 While the function for â&#128;&#156;planning for economic and social&#13;
                developmentâ&#128;&#157; is reported as having been transferred to ULBs, the mission&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
83&#13;
  In the wider India context, there has not been a significant increase in the volume of municipal spending noting&#13;
the lack of increased fiscal autonomy. See: Mathur, Om Prakash. Municipal Finance Matters. PowerPoint&#13;
Presentation at World Bank. June 2, 2014.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             103&#13;
&amp;#12;                interlocutors, including the local government chief executive, did not suggest a&#13;
                municipal role in economic planning and implementation.85&#13;
&#13;
            b. Funding: Municipalities in India, including municipal corporations in large urban&#13;
               areas, have low municipal spending ability and limited fiscal powers more&#13;
               generally.86 The institutional ability to make and implement decisions at the city&#13;
               level is shared by the Municipal Corporationâ&#128;&#153;s elected officials as well as the state&#13;
               government appointed Municipal Commissioner and lower level commissioners.&#13;
&#13;
            c. A well-defined geographical remit: Political legitimacy and accountability&#13;
               appear to be hampered by having both state and local government leadership at&#13;
               the city level, with the main executive power holders appointed by higher tiers of&#13;
               government, and not elected by the cityâ&#128;&#153;s constituents. While the Coimbatore City&#13;
               Municipal Corporation is the primary urban-tier local body in Coimbatore (and&#13;
               the only municipal corporation in the metropolitan area), it does not have&#13;
               functional authority beyond the city limits. The Municipal Corporation Mayor is&#13;
               popularly elected to a five year term and yet ostensibly only a figurehead in&#13;
               Coimbatore. The Municipal Commissioner is the local governmentâ&#128;&#153;s chief&#13;
               executive and is appointed for a fixed, renewable term. The District&#13;
               Administration, whose responsibility extends across the metropolitan area, does&#13;
               not perform economic development functions.&#13;
&#13;
     b. Efficient internal management: While interview findings suggest a low level of&#13;
        capacity for the Coimbatore government, the CCMC seemed to perform well in its main&#13;
        infrastructure functional responsibilities. The CCMC beat out 11 competitors in Tamil&#13;
        Nadu State to receive the highest state municipal corporation honors. It won out due to its&#13;
        performance on roads and sewage management, but, more importantly in terms of&#13;
        management, for its high levels of tax collection and the implementation of an e-&#13;
        government system.&#13;
&#13;
            a. Roles: The district administration provides licenses and approvals, administers&#13;
               revenue, and acts as a â&#128;&#156;pass-through mechanismâ&#128;&#157;. A range of economic&#13;
               development functions, including entrepreneurial training, skill development,&#13;
               business advisory services, trade promotion, are played by the District Industries&#13;
               Center and local chapter of the Ministry of MSME. Additional functions such as&#13;
               branding, government lobbying (on behalf of local firms), business cluster&#13;
               development and entrepreneurial support, are carried out by the cityâ&#128;&#153;s industry&#13;
               associations.&#13;

   In person interview with Ms. Latha, Municipal Commissioner, Coimbatore Municipal Corporation, in&#13;
Coimbatore, India, on June 17, 2014.&#13;

   Mathur, Om Prakash. Municipal Finance Matters. PowerPoint Presentation at World Bank. June 2 2014.&#13;
                                                                                                   104&#13;
&amp;#12;       â&#128;¢   Enabling environment: Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s inclusion in the national JnNURM scheme&#13;
           provided additional infrastructure funding along with national government&#13;
           monitoring of the implementation of decentralization in the city, local government&#13;
           capacity, and how this reflects on urban planning, This provided a greater impetus&#13;
           for the city to develop an initial city development plan (2006), a follow-up city&#13;
           development plan due to be released later in 2014, and an update to the 1994&#13;
           master plan.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Monitoring &amp; evaluation: The most recent Coimbatore city development plan, a&#13;
           draft copy of which was provided to the mission team, includes a vision and&#13;
           development strategy projected to 2045. However, its main focus is on land use&#13;
           and the provision of municipal services. The vision, strategy, and implementation&#13;
           framework do not go into adequate detail, and do not suggest any mechanisms for&#13;
           thorough assessment of implementation against objectives.&#13;
&#13;
c. Private sector and stakeholder involvement in implementation: Given the absence of&#13;
   an economic development strategy for the city and governmentâ&#128;&#153;s limited role in&#13;
   economic development more generally, the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation only&#13;
   identifies government stakeholders as part of its consultations for the upcoming city&#13;
   development plan. The private sector plays the leading role in Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
   development, yet is no structured forum or channel for dialogue between public and&#13;
   private sector actors. Details:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s for-profit firms pool their (limited) financial and in-kind resources&#13;
           to help market and promote the city as a business and tourism destination.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Industry associations actively work to integrate local small and medium-sized&#13;
           businesses into multinationalsâ&#128;&#153; global supply chains.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Senior corporate leaders, both at home-grown firms and those based elsewhere,&#13;
           act as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s public champions and utilize their relationship capital to secure&#13;
           more investment and business opportunities for Coimbatore and its companies.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Coimbatoreâ&#128;&#153;s private-sector firms are actively engaged in workforce&#13;
           development, having established educational institutions and now collaborating&#13;
           with them by enabling students to spend time on the factory shop floor.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Given the prevalence of SMEs in Coimbatore, trade unions do not play a&#13;
           prominent role in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ There is no permanent â&#128;&#156;growth coalitionâ&#128;&#157; as such, although stakeholders do self-&#13;
           organize on an ad-hoc basis in response to specific issues and opportunities.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The case study of the economic success of Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda, is the third in&#13;
the series of World Bank case studies of successful metropolitan economies around the&#13;
world. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive Cities Knowledge Base project aims to provide city&#13;
leaders with the tools and knowledge for the successful formulation and implementation of&#13;
effective economic development strategies at the city level. No single case study will provide a&#13;
recipe for success for other city leaders, but each case study in the series will offer insights and&#13;
strategies for cities with similar conditions, factors and challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Kigali was selected as a case study because, between 2007 and 2012, the city experienced&#13;
exceptionally high rates of economic growth. As part of the city selection exercise, cities in the&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa region were ranked according to the amount by which they exceeded the&#13;
average national growth rates87. The intent was to identify competitive cities, or cities that had&#13;
â&#128;&#156;outperformedâ&#128;&#157; their national economies in terms of GDP and job growth. These outlier cities&#13;
were of great interest; as understanding how these outlier, competitive cities were able to achieve&#13;
high levels of growth (when cities with the same set of macroeconomic conditions and national&#13;
policies had not) could offer lessons to others interested in potential strategies and effective&#13;
levers that can be utilized at the municipal level to improve economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
Further, Kigali has not had access to many of the advantages that other cities in the region&#13;
enjoyed. As the nationâ&#128;&#153;s capital, Kigali has benefitted from national attention and assistance&#13;
(especially for infrastructure development) and its ability to attract talent from around the&#13;
country. However, Kigali lacks many inherited advantages that other cities and countries within&#13;
the region enjoy; like abundant land and natural resources, cheap energy, transport linkages, a&#13;
flagship university or anchor investments. Above all, Kigali (and Rwanda) suffered from years&#13;
of instability and violence, which culminated in the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. Yet less than 20&#13;
years after the genocide, Kigali is experiencing exceptional levels of economic growth that go&#13;
beyond modest recovery growth (see figure below). This begs the question: How? And,&#13;
importantly, what can other cities learn from Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s example?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
87&#13;
  The City of Kigali ranked in the top 20 cities in the region for outperforming the national rate of growth; top 3 for&#13;
capital cities in the region; and the top 3 for cities in natural resource poor countries in the region.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   115&#13;
&amp;#12;Source: World Development Indicators, World Bank&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, the story of Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s economic success provides a useful learning experience for&#13;
other cities around the world, because like many other cities, Kigali is:&#13;
&#13;
   1.   A capital and primary city&#13;
   2.   Located in a country with a strong, proactive national government&#13;
   3.   Lacking inherited natural advantages (i.e. landlocked and small)&#13;
   4.   Recovering from conflict and needing to rebuild both the city and the economy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Yet unlike other cities, Kigali has experienced extraordinary economic growth; attributed&#13;
in part to the successful leveraging of national level strategies, as well as to improvements&#13;
to local government capacity and the attractiveness of the city, including:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Creating a conducive environment for business and improving the ability of firms to&#13;
      operate (e.g. obtain a construction permit, access finance, etc.);&#13;
   2. Building up local government capacity with international exchanges and external experts&#13;
      that assist staff with the learning and implementation of new tools to improve local&#13;
      capacity in prioritized areas (e.g. tax collection)&#13;
   3. Increasing the relative attractiveness of the city by improving unique liveability factors&#13;
      (e.g. cleanliness, safety) and marketing widely and clearly investment opportunities&#13;
      within the city.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
As the capital and primary city, the City of Kigali benefitted from national policies that&#13;
improved governance and the business environment. Since 2000, Rwanda has been steadily&#13;
implementing reforms to promote stability and economic growth in the country. As the capital&#13;
city and center of economic activity in the country, Kigali benefitted significantly from these&#13;
improvements. Specifically, Kigali has benefitted from 3 main factors:&#13;
&#13;
1. National Economic Planning and Implementation: National level plans outlined strategies&#13;
   and set goals according to short, medium and long-term horizons to improve implementation,&#13;
   as well as agency coordination. Targeted strategies were also developed to promote the&#13;
   growth of key economic sectors, and ultimately help the country achieve middle-income&#13;
   status by 2020.&#13;
&#13;
2. Improved Safety and Good Governance: Efforts to improve safety had far-reaching impacts&#13;
   on economic growth, including: increasing local business activity, attracting the diaspora&#13;
   community and other professional talent (to relocate to Kigali), and expanding foreign&#13;
   investment and opportunities for tourism in the country. Governance reforms like&#13;
   performance contracts, the zero tolerance policy on corruption and decentralization have&#13;
   further improved the accountability and performance of government officials.&#13;
&#13;
3. Enacting Key Reforms to Improve the Ability to Do Business: Rwanda prioritized the&#13;
   improvement of the business environment and has been a top reformer according to the&#13;
   World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Doing Business survey. Notable improvements include land reform (through&#13;
   the Land Tenure Regularization Program), that encouraged private land ownership and freed&#13;
   up land markets; and the centralization of investment promotion activities within one agency-&#13;
   the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).&#13;
&#13;
The City of Kigali created a niche for itself in terms of economic development. The Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Wedge, or amount of autonomy over economic development, is relatively small in Kigali.&#13;
However within this wedge, the city still managed to create a role for itself by leveraging&#13;
national level programs and playing up its own competitive strengths to promote growth. The&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s actions can be grouped into 5 key areas of intervention, Kigali:&#13;
&#13;
1. Improved the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business environment: The City of Kigali proactively undertook an&#13;
   assessment of the enabling environment according to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Doing Business&#13;
   survey (adopting this â&#128;&#156;best practiceâ&#128;&#157; from the national level). This assessment included&#13;
   feedback from the private sector, through the newly established Kigali Investors Forum, and&#13;
   concluded with the implementation of specific reforms to address identified constraints.&#13;
&#13;
2. Built up capacity within local government: Understanding that high capacity staff are&#13;
   necessary for a high-functioning municipal government, Kigali incorporated capacity&#13;
   building opportunities into problem-solving exercises. The city utilized learning exchanges&#13;
                                                                                            118&#13;
&amp;#12;   that involved sending key personnel to other cities to learn specific skills (like tax collection&#13;
   systems, or economic planning), and bringing these same experts back to Kigali to assist with&#13;
   the implementation of these new skillsets and ideas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Addressed bottlenecks and constraints for the private sector: The city engaged regularly&#13;
   with the private sector to better understand constraints to doing business. Through these&#13;
   engagements, the city identified access to finance and land ownership as two key constraints&#13;
   for local firms. The city then addressed these constraints by helping firms (and small&#13;
   producers) to organize as cooperatives and co-locate operations; providing groups with land&#13;
   titles for the new properties. Further, the city worked with financial institutions to provide&#13;
   these same land titles as collateral and subsequently helped increase access to finance.&#13;
&#13;
4. Accentuated its unique liveability appeal: Kigali is attractive to both domestic and foreign&#13;
   residents because of both inherited (climate, low corruption efforts by national government)&#13;
   and constructed factors (cleanliness, safety). The cityâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;clean appealâ&#128;&#157; evolved from cleaning&#13;
   initiatives that began shortly after the Genocide; but keeping the city clean became a tradition&#13;
   that individual residents took pride in and promoted through monthly neighborhood clean&#13;
   ups. Further, residents began contributing to local security services, in order to maintain the&#13;
   safe climate they had come to expect. Investors and foreign businesses took note of this&#13;
   liveability, and have cited Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s liveable environment- including cleanliness, safety, low&#13;
   corruption and low traffic- as a key factor in their decisions to live, work and invest in the&#13;
   city (especially when compared to other cities in the region).&#13;
&#13;
5. Marketed city appeal to investors and key actors to attract new investment: Through&#13;
   designing an award winning urban plan that demonstrates a long-term vision for economic&#13;
   prosperity, Kigali has caught the eye of numerous investors. The Kigali Conceptual Master&#13;
   Plan (and later the Kigali City Master Plan- KCMP) has been used as a promotional tool to&#13;
   demonstrate viable opportunities for investment in the city. Paired with a good investment&#13;
   climate and government commitment (signaled by the completion of infrastructure projects&#13;
   in line with the long-term vision), the plan has successfully attracted numerous new&#13;
   investments by foreign and domestic investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In sum, the City of Kigali enjoyed high rates of economic growth in terms of GDP and job&#13;
growth, because of a combination of both inherited and constructed factors. As the capital&#13;
city, Kigali benefitted from national level economic planning (including proactive sector&#13;
targeting), improved safety and governance, and business environment reforms. However the&#13;
city also contributed to its own growth by supplementing and replicating national level efforts at&#13;
the city level, and capitalizing on its competitive advantages. This included: improving the&#13;
municipal business environment and the ability of firms to operate, pro-actively building up local&#13;
government capacity, and improving and marketing the relative attractiveness of the city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                119&#13;
&amp;#12;National Context&#13;
&#13;
Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s economic success is in large part due to national level improvements. Growth in&#13;
Kigali has chiefly been a result of policies implemented at the national level. These policies have&#13;
focused on promoting stability and economic growth; including improvements to economic&#13;
planning, governance, the ease of doing business and macroeconomic policy (e.g. stable&#13;
currency, prudent debt management, and inflation under control). While national-level policies&#13;
have been good for growth in many parts of the country, Kigali has benefitted significantly as the&#13;
majority of investment and high-skilled jobs have landed in the nationâ&#128;&#153;s primary city. The&#13;
following section describes the national environment to serve two related objectives: (1) to&#13;
illuminate major national level factors that contributed to economic growth in Kigali and, (2) to&#13;
explain how Kigali has leveraged these national level efforts to promote further growth.&#13;
&#13;
Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s national government has contributed to Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s impressive success through 3&#13;
main factors:&#13;
&#13;
   1. National Economic Planning and Implementation&#13;
   2. Improved Safety and Good Governance&#13;
   3. Enacting Key Reforms to Improve the Ability to Do Business&#13;
&#13;
Factor 1: National Economic Planning and Implementation&#13;
&#13;
Rwanda utilized national level plans to set goals, outline strategies, and coordinate among&#13;
agencies. One of the most prominent plans is Vision 2020. Led by President Kagame in 2000,&#13;
this was the first long-term plan that clearly established national level priorities, most notably,&#13;
the goal of transforming Rwanda into a middle income country by the year 2020.&#13;
&#13;
Yet national planning was not limited to developing long-term visions, but was applied to&#13;
short and medium term goals as well. In order to break long-term visions into manageable and&#13;
perhaps â&#128;&#156;implementableâ&#128;&#157; pieces, the government created medium (Economic Development and&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, EDPRS) and short-term plans (annual action plans) to set&#13;
targets, measure progress and improve accountability. The plans were implemented strictly with&#13;
dedicated funding, and both, national agencies and local governments, were held accountable for&#13;
meeting targets through performance contracts. On the whole, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s success has not been&#13;
due to the long-term vision itself, but rather due to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to transform (and&#13;
implement) a long-term vision into short-term action plans, that were backed by funding and&#13;
accountability mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               120&#13;
&amp;#12;The Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Office developed targeted strategies aimed at the growth of key sectors. In&#13;
order to usher the country into middle-income status in only 20 years, a clear plan for economic&#13;
prosperity had to be developed. In the early 2000s, the Ministry of Commerce conducted an&#13;
analysis of economic constraints and opportunities across different districts. This analysis fed&#13;
into the development of national strategies that promoted investments in sectors with the highest&#13;
potential for growth. The selected sectors were diverse, including:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Agriculture, where the majority of Rwandans worked;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Tourism, an industry with potential and existing firm capacity (see pg. 9); and&#13;
   â&#128;¢   ICT, where leaders understood Rwanda would have to develop capacity in order to&#13;
       cultivate a tertiary industry that could support a larger middle class (see pg. 10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             121&#13;
&amp;#12;                         Proactive Sector Targeting: The Tourism Sector&#13;
&#13;
The national government identified tourism as a high potential sector very early on. Rwanda had&#13;
always enjoyed demand for tourism services because of the natural beauty of its volcanos and lakes, and&#13;
the presence of rare gorilla families. However years of violence and instability weakened demand. After&#13;
security was restored in the early 2000s, the demand for tourism services surged and tourists returned in&#13;
high numbers.&#13;
&#13;
The national government devised a strategy in light of the constraints that Rwanda faced in the&#13;
tourism industry. Rwanda would be unable to compete with safari tours in Kenya and Tanzania given&#13;
their experience in the market and the lack of domestic capacity to handle large numbers of tourists. The&#13;
Government decided to create a niche in the market: promoting high-end tourism for unique â&#128;&#156;gorilla&#13;
experiencesâ&#128;&#157; that would result in fewer tourists without compromising on revenues, because of the high&#13;
priced permit fees mandated by the government.&#13;
&#13;
A second niche was developed in light of Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s unique advantages in the tourism industry; for&#13;
Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events (MICE) Tourism. Kigali enjoyed several unique&#13;
characteristics in the region including low traffic congestion, high levels of safety, cleanliness (i.e. tidy&#13;
streets) and a central location in Africa. The hosting of conferences and events seemed like a natural fit&#13;
for these assets and would give Kigali a competitive edge in this market over other large cities in the&#13;
region that lacked these factors (e.g. Nairobi).&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, the government, seeking to further its competitive advantage in multiple sectors,&#13;
promoted multi-lingual capacity among residents through education, requiring schools to teach in&#13;
both French and English. The Government also attracted private sector investors, through tenders and&#13;
Requests for Proposals (RFPs), to build hotels and a conference center; choosing â&#128;&#156;leadingâ&#128;&#157; investors like&#13;
the Radisson and Marriott (hotel groups) with the expectation that other industry actors would soon&#13;
follow.&#13;
&#13;
The decision to target the tourism sector was part of a larger, participatory process. Private sector&#13;
players engaged with government officials and communicated their interests in growing the tourism&#13;
sector in Rwanda. The sector might have been small in the late 1990s, but the players were long-&#13;
established and relatively sophisticated, which helped increase their ability to influence decision makers.&#13;
&#13;
In 2002, the tourism industry was chosen deliberately as a focus for proactive targeting. At that&#13;
time, the RDB hired a consulting firm and organized a working group to develop an action plan. The&#13;
working group consisted of 80-120 people, made up of both private sector and government actors. The&#13;
decisions that were made (and voted on) by the working group were taken to the National Cabinet by the&#13;
Ministry of Trade and Industry to be approved as national policy. The strategy included an action plan,&#13;
which was incorporated into the action plans of individual actors (like the RDBâ&#128;&#153;s yearly action plan),&#13;
along with dedicated funding to ensure implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Results: Today, tourism is the largest generator of foreign exchange in the country.&#13;

&amp;#12;                        Proactive Sector Targeting: The ICT Sector&#13;
&#13;
Unlike in the tourism industry, there was no existing capacity in ICT when the sector&#13;
was prioritized in the early 2000s. The decision to promote the ICT sector was made in&#13;
response to existing constraints, rather than existing capabilities. According to President&#13;
Kagame, because of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s limited natural resources, Rwanda would need to make its&#13;
people the countryâ&#128;&#153;s greatest resource. The future ICT sector would be largely dependent on&#13;
high levels of human capital which the national leadership intended to develop as part of the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s long-term economic growth strategy.&#13;
&#13;
The first priority was an environment conducive to the ICT industry. Fiber optic cables&#13;
were installed and made accessible. The telecommunications industry was liberalized and&#13;
mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions jumped from 33.4 per 100 inhabitants in 2010 to 63&#13;
per 100 inhabitants in 2013 (Rwanda Ministry of Youth and ICT, â&#128;&#156;MYICTâ&#128;&#157; report).&#13;
Broadband internet coverage was extended, and Rwanda displaced Ghana to become the&#13;
country with the fastest broadband internet speed in Africa (according to the latest statistics&#13;
from Ooklaâ&#128;&#153;s NetIndex).&#13;
&#13;
Another priority was improving human capital by improving domestic education&#13;
programs and attracting foreign educational institutions. The Government of Rwanda&#13;
approached Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to develop a Center of Excellence in&#13;
Rwanda that would address the lack of professional capacity in science and technology.&#13;
While the University was not looking for opportunities in the region at the time (it already&#13;
had campuses in Qatar and China), it found itself attracted to the quality of life, safety and&#13;
the commitment of political leaders in Rwanda. The Government had offered a lucrative&#13;
deal, underwriting all costs of the program so that the University could maintain the quality&#13;
and cost of its degree program. Both parties agreed to the terms and as of 2014, the Carnegie&#13;
Mellon University Campus in Rwanda graduated its first class of 22 students with Masterâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Degrees in Science and Technology (equivalent of a degree from the main campus in&#13;
Pittsburgh, PA).&#13;
&#13;
The Government hopes to build a competitive ICT sector that will help address issues&#13;
of youth unemployment and the need to develop globally competitive tradable services.&#13;
Despite the improvements outlined above and efforts made to attract new firms, challenges&#13;
still remain: like a limited domestic consumer market and preference for expats in&#13;
technology or high capacity roles within Rwanda. The national governmentâ&#128;&#153;s investment in&#13;
the ICT industry continues in the present day with the understanding that benefits will most&#13;
likely be realized over the longer term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             123&#13;
&amp;#12;Factor 2: Improved Safety and Good Governance&#13;
&#13;
Efforts to improve safety have had far-reaching impacts on economic growth. Following the&#13;
genocide there was a period of stabilization and recovery in the late 1990s. The need to restore&#13;
safety and stability, and the need to rebuild institutions and trust was critical. It took until the&#13;
early 21st century for improvements in safety to affect directly economic activity.&#13;
&#13;
The ability to promote a safe environment for doing business is no small feat in the region.&#13;
In Rwanda, improved security enables shopkeepers and venders to stay open later and store cash&#13;
and supplies without fear. This is also true for female vendors and shop-keepers, encouraging&#13;
women to play an important role in the economy. Expatriates identified safety in Rwanda as a&#13;
unique feature in the region, with ripple effects on the economy that have not only impacted&#13;
existing firms, but also expanded the economy, for example:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Improved safety has encouraged the return of refugees and members of the diaspora&#13;
         community, most of whom have resettled in Kigali, creating a denser urban&#13;
         agglomeration and consumer market with demand for services and housing.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Improved safety has allowed the tourism industry to flourish.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Improved safety has increased the attractiveness of Rwanda to foreign investors.&#13;
&#13;
Governance reforms have improved the accountability of government at the national and&#13;
local levels. Reforms and policies designed to improve the effectiveness of governance and&#13;
service delivery have included specific measures like:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Performance contracts: Performance contracts â&#128;&#147; based on the precolonial Rwandan&#13;
         tradition of Imihigo- are signed between local Mayors (or Governors) and the President at&#13;
         the beginning of the formersâ&#128;&#153; terms. The contracts bind the Mayors to agreed-upon&#13;
         economic and social targets based on the needs of the districts and the national priorities.&#13;
         Internal government audits are conducted to measure performance against targets each&#13;
         year, and additionally, Mayors must read aloud in Parliament their progress on each of&#13;
         the targets. These testimonies are broadcasted through television and social media to&#13;
         ensure local constituents are informed.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Zero tolerance policy on corruption: The President has been a champion of the zero-&#13;
         tolerance approach to corruption. To improve implementation of the policy, the&#13;
         Ombudsman Office was created in 200488 to monitor compliance across government&#13;
         sectors. As further proof that the policy was to be taken seriously; several key officials&#13;
         have been removed from office and received prison terms for their offenses.&#13;

&amp;#12;     â&#128;¢   Decentralization: Decentralization of authority and responsibility to the district level&#13;
         was carried out in 2001 to improve participation at the local level and improve&#13;
         accountability of local government officials. Decentralization happened in two phases:&#13;
         Initially 11 provinces (plus the City of Kigali) were established. In the second phase, the&#13;
         11 provinces were consolidated into 4 provinces (plus the City of Kigali). Each district&#13;
         became responsible for its own development plan which included economic and social&#13;
         goals. These district level plans were then integrated into the medium term national plans&#13;
         (the EDPRS). Performance contracts were also implemented at this time, which led to&#13;
         improvements in planning, target-setting, and outcomes at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 3: Enacting Key Reforms to Improve the Ability to Do Business&#13;
&#13;
Apart from proactively targeting specific sectors, the national government made&#13;
investments to improve the business enabling environment, including:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Doing Business Reforms: The national leadership prioritized improving the overall&#13;
         business environment. Using the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Doing Business evaluation tool as a&#13;
         guide, the government made key improvements, resulting in the World Bank recognizing&#13;
         Rwanda as one of the top reformers in both 201089 and 201190 (in 2014, Rwanda would&#13;
         move up to 32nd place91).&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Land Registration: Land ownership has not always been clear in Rwanda (especially&#13;
         after the 1994 Genocide and the return of large numbers of refugees) and land registration&#13;
         processes used to take up to 2 years. However, the Land Tenure Regularization Program&#13;
         that became law in 2005 (and was implemented in 2007) addressed these problems and&#13;
         other land disputes, by improving the land registration process, encouraging private&#13;
         ownership of land and freeing up land markets. The program led to a real estate and&#13;
         construction boom, and subsequent increases in job creation.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Centralizing investment promotion within one agency, in 2009, the Rwanda&#13;
         Development Board (RDB): The RDB was established to fast track priority investments&#13;
         in Rwanda, specifically investments in targeted sectors outlined in Vision 2020. The&#13;
         RDB actively reaches out to investors and provides country-wide investment information.&#13;
         Specialized packages are developed for investors in priority sectors, including no/low&#13;
         taxes, free imports on goods to do business, etc. The RDB has a clear mandate and&#13;
         collaborates with provincial and district governments by dividing responsibilities: the&#13;
         RDB handles investment attraction and incentives; while the local governments handle&#13;
         the provision of land and project facilitation (e.g. construction permits).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Local Context&#13;
&#13;
Kigali is the capital and primary city of Rwanda. In 2012, the City of Kigali accounted for&#13;
approximately 10% of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s population (over 1 million people), and approximately 20% of&#13;
the nationâ&#128;&#153;s GDP92. Since the 1990s, the cityâ&#128;&#153;s population has grown quite rapidly; from a&#13;
population of 235,000 in the early 1990s, to over 600,000 just 10 years later. At present, Kigali is&#13;
the largest city in Rwanda and accounts for the majority of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s urban population,&#13;
making it a center for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s industrial, service and administrative activities.&#13;
&#13;
In March 2001, Rwanda began to decentralize authority to the local government level. In&#13;
Rwanda, local government is broken down into 4 units: provinces, districts, sectors and cells.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Provinces: Rwanda is currently divided into 4 provinces plus the City of Kigali. While&#13;
          the City of Kigali is relatively smaller than the other provinces in terms of population, it&#13;
          is more drastically small in terms of land, accounting for only 730 km2 (compared to an&#13;
          average of 6,000 km2 among the other 4 provinces). Provinces are expected to help&#13;
          execute central government plans, as well as supervise and coordinate among the districts&#13;
          under their administration. The provinces are each governed by a:&#13;
              o Governor, who ensures adherence to laws, implementation of programs, and&#13;
                 promotes development within the province.&#13;
              o Provincial Coordination Committee, which examines and coordinates matters of&#13;
                 the province (includes the Governor, Permanent Secretary, Department&#13;
                 Coordinators, District Representatives, etc.)&#13;

&amp;#12;               o Provincial Permanent Secretary, who ensures the coordination of administrative&#13;
                    and technical services93&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Districts: Each province in Rwanda is subsequently broken up into districts, with over 30&#13;
           districts nationwide. Districts are considered the local government unit, and have&#13;
           typically been the recipient of decentralized authority and responsibility. Districts are&#13;
           governed by district leaders (who are elected to 5 year terms) and district councils.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While the City of Kigali is a province administratively, it is&#13;
unique in that it represents 3 districts within the same&#13;
metropolitan area. Therefore the City of Kigali has special&#13;
administrative powers, like having its own budget, which makes&#13;
its authority and responsibilities a blend of both the provincial&#13;
and district level. Kigali is made up of 3 districts that comprise&#13;
the Metropolitan Area (see map on right), and receives funding&#13;
through local tax collection and budget allocations from the&#13;
National Government. The City of Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s government has a&#13;
Mayor, 2 Vice Mayors, a city council, and a "supervising role"&#13;
for the minister of local government, although the Mayor takes&#13;
the lead on city-level initiatives. However, in terms of economic&#13;
planning, the â&#128;&#156;Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s wedgeâ&#128;&#157; is relatively small, with&#13;
investment promotion, proactive sector targeting and economic planning largely carried out at&#13;
the national level.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Factors of Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
While national level factors contributed significantly to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic success, Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
ability to capitalize on national strategies gave the city an additional edge. The majority of&#13;
foreign investment ends up in Kigali because of the availability of human capital and&#13;
infrastructure. Even sectors based elsewhere in the country have contributed to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economy; for instance, most tourists that come to Rwanda for gorilla tourism tend to spend a&#13;
night or two in the capital before continuing on to their destinations. Yet apart from these&#13;
primary city advantages and national policy improvements, Kigali has, within its relatively small&#13;
policy wedge, created a niche for itself in promoting private sector growth and the attractiveness&#13;
of the city.&#13;

&amp;#12;In the following section, the key initiatives undertaken by the City of Kigali will be&#13;
described. These include:&#13;
&#13;
   1.   Improving the business enabling environment;&#13;
   2.   Building up capacity within the local government;&#13;
   3.   Addressing bottlenecks and constraints for the private sector;&#13;
   4.   Accentuating its unique liveability appeal; and&#13;
   5.   Marketing its appeal to investors and key actors in order to attract new investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 1: Improved the Business Enabling Environment&#13;
&#13;
The City of Kigali sought to improve the business environment after witnessing Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
success on the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Doing Business rankings. As mayor of the city (2006-2011), Dr.&#13;
Aisa Kacyira observed that national level efforts to improve the Doing Business environment&#13;
had been met with great success, improving Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s reputation as well as the ability of firms to&#13;
operate. She decided to reach out to the World Bank to set up a city level analysis of the business&#13;
environment, which was then carried out in conjunction with the RDB.&#13;
&#13;
City leaders coupled this analysis with&#13;
                                                        Proactive piloting of projects&#13;
formalized platforms for stakeholder&#13;
                                              Although economic development strategies were&#13;
engagement to understand better the&#13;
                                              frequently developed at the national level, the&#13;
constraints to doing business. Dr. Aisa&#13;
                                              City of Kigali was proactive in implementing&#13;
created the Kigali Investors Forum, the&#13;
                                              best practices. In 2011 the City of Kigali piloted&#13;
first   organization     that    formalized&#13;
                                              an electronic platform for construction permits&#13;
stakeholder engagement. The Forum&#13;
                                              (supported by the IFC and the African&#13;
provided a platform for private sector&#13;
                                              Development Bank). Kigali decided to invest in&#13;
investors who had purchased land (or&#13;
                                              its own electronic platform for construction&#13;
were currently building) to express issues&#13;
                                              permits because it wanted to reduce red tape even&#13;
or highlight constraints that were&#13;
                                              further and had learned of Nairobiâ&#128;&#153;s success with&#13;
preventing them from completing their&#13;
                                              the electronic system. The city initiated the&#13;
projects and starting their businesses.&#13;
                                              project and provided funding from the municipal&#13;
                                              budget. At present, Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s success with the&#13;
                                              electronic permit system has encouraged its&#13;
The city implemented reforms to               adoption in other Rwandan cities. While the&#13;
address key constraints. The Doing            effects of the electronic platform are not captured&#13;
Business assessment and the Kigali            as part of this study, it is testament to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

and lack of coordination between&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               128&#13;
&amp;#12;agencies regarding construction permitsâ&#128;&#157; as major constraints to doing business. This&#13;
information led to the establishment of the City of Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s One Stop Shop, in 2010, that housed&#13;
all of the agencies that needed to approve construction permits under one roof. Investors would&#13;
have one place to apply for (and be granted) all necessary approvals, and receive a construction&#13;
permit within 30 days. According to a study on comparative advantage by the Ministry of&#13;
Commerce, this level of follow through was typical in Kigali. The city was proactive in learning&#13;
from others and in implementing reforms.&#13;
&#13;
In sum, the city improved the business enabling environment by:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Identifying best practices at the national level and applying these at the city level;&#13;
   2. Using expert assistance to help conduct assessments of major constraints;&#13;
   3. Formalizing stakeholder engagement to promote regular feedback from the private sector;&#13;
      and&#13;
   4. Addressing identified constraints by implementing appropriate reforms (e.g. One Stop&#13;
      Shop).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 2: Built Up Capacity within Local Government&#13;
&#13;
Improving the capacity of local government required more than just attracting top talent,&#13;
but building capacity through technical learning exchanges and the use of expert&#13;
consultants. Mayor Theoneste Mutsindashyaka (2001-2005) wanted high level professionals on&#13;
his staff. Early in his term as Mayor, he began to employ graduates from leading local&#13;
universities. As the countryâ&#128;&#153;s capital, Kigali found it easy to attract talent from around Rwanda.&#13;
However the Mayor knew that he needed more than just recruitment programs to build capacity.&#13;
&#13;
The Mayor facilitated learning and training opportunities in priority areas. Mayor&#13;
Mutsindashyaka reached out to John Street, the then Mayor of Philadelphia, and facilitated an&#13;
exchange program between the two cities in the areas of economic planning and tax collection,&#13;
both of which had become priority areas due to a lack of capacity among staff. Vision 2020 had&#13;
just been released and economic planning was encouraged among local governments. Yet there&#13;
was little or no capacity within Kigali to design an&#13;
                                                          Both outputs were not successful;&#13;
economic plan. Additionally, the city continued to be&#13;
                                                          in fact, years later the KEDS plan&#13;
largely dependent on central government transfers and&#13;
                                                          was all but forgotten. The KEDS&#13;
lacked the capacity to increase tax collection rates.&#13;
                                                          plan was never fully implemented,&#13;
                                                          but it did help to improve planning&#13;
The partnership with the City of Philadelphia&#13;
                                                          capacity over time. National officials&#13;
became an opportunity to address these&#13;
shortcomings. The City of Kigali financed a month- testified that each input from the City&#13;
long visit for key officials from the departments of of Kigali to the EDPRS plan was&#13;
                                                          better than the last.&#13;
                                                                                              129&#13;
&amp;#12;Urban Planning and Finance to work with officials in Philadelphia. Following which, officials&#13;
from Philadelphia came to Kigali, accompanied by GTZ-financed consultants, to assist with the&#13;
implementation of lessons learned. As a result, Kigali developed the Kigali Economic&#13;
Development Strategy (KEDS) in 2003; and adopted new software to improve land titling and&#13;
tax collection in the city&#13;
&#13;
The improved tax collection capacity in the city included a computer titling system, which&#13;
helped raise tax revenues from 20% to 85%. This meant that the City of Kigali was able to&#13;
finance more activities through own-tax revenues, providing it with greater leeway over project&#13;
design and decisions. At one point, tax experts in Kigali provided training workshops to country-&#13;
wide officials; their audience even included staff from the national Rwanda Revenue Authority.&#13;
&#13;
In sum, the city successfully improved its capacity by:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Capacity building alongside problem solving: the city did not use experts that solved&#13;
      problems and left, but instead improved the capacity of local staff by facilitating learning&#13;
      opportunities in key technical areas.&#13;
   2. Using exchanges to not just share ideas, but implement actions: Kigali again exhibited&#13;
      follow through, bringing in experts to help not only with the design of new ideas, but&#13;
      with the implementation of these ideas as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 3: Addressed Bottlenecks and Constraints for the Private Sector&#13;
&#13;
The City of Kigali promoted the private sector by engaging with the business community&#13;
and addressing identified constraints to growth. Two examples of these efforts include&#13;
providing assistance to individual cooperatives and SMEs through land title programs, and&#13;
working with financial institutions to improve access to finance. During Mayor&#13;
Mutsindashyakaâ&#128;&#153;s term in office, more than 90% of investment was local, and was directed&#13;
mostly into construction and rebuilding the city. The city maintained close relations with the&#13;
business community; and through informal feedback loops, was able to understand specific&#13;
bottlenecks and constraints to growth.&#13;
&#13;
The city provided land and land titles to small and informal firms, encouraging their&#13;
growth and formalization. A key constraint for firms was access to land, especially among&#13;
small firms. Many firms leased their property and only when they had paid 40% of the property&#13;
value did they receive the title to the property. This meant that many firms lacked collateral and&#13;
subsequently, access to finance. The city addressed this constraint in two ways; 1) the city&#13;
encouraged the formation of cooperatives by providing land to SMEs in physical clusters; and 2)&#13;
these firms (and newly-formed cooperatives) were provided with land titles for their new&#13;
property. The computer titling system (developed from training exchanges explained under&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              130&#13;
&amp;#12;Factor 2) not only improved the tax collection capacity of the government, but provided formal&#13;
evidence of property ownership as well.&#13;
&#13;
The city addressed the lack of access to finance for SMEs and cooperatives. City officials&#13;
went to meet with financial institutions to better understand the lending risks to small businesses.&#13;
During this meeting, the City of Kigali was requested to underwrite loans for the SMEs, as SMEs&#13;
were considered high-risk borrowers (mostly because they lacked collateral). Instead, the cash-&#13;
strapped city cleverly offered to provide land titles (from the newly developed computerized&#13;
titling system) as collateral instead of underwriting the loans. This helped extend finance to&#13;
previously credit-constrained groups, while at the same time allowing the city to avoid direct&#13;
involvement in individual lending.&#13;
&#13;
In sum, the city successfully addressed bottlenecks to growth by:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Engaging with private sector stakeholders to understand constraints;&#13;
    2. Helping small firms to obtain affordable land while also promoting physical clusters,&#13;
       cooperatives, and business registration (through land titles).&#13;
    3. Finding a market based solution to improve access to finance without becoming the&#13;
       direct provider of loans or putting the city financially at risk by co-signing loans.&#13;
&#13;
* The private sector continues to be underdeveloped in Kigali, and the strategies explained&#13;
above have in no way provided a cure for or fully addressed the problem. The policies and&#13;
interventions did have an impact, as access to finance has steadily increased over the decade and&#13;
land rights and land markets have become more transparent (improving the business enabling&#13;
environment). However there is still much work to be done within the private sector to address&#13;
bottlenecks that discourage the cultivation of a thriving business community.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 4: Accentuated its Unique Liveability Appeal&#13;
&#13;
One of the reasons that Kigali is attractive to both domestic and foreign residents is&#13;
because if offers a liveable environment - it offers safety, cleanliness, low traffic, minimal&#13;
corruption and pleasant weather. Several of these factors are not under the control of the city.&#13;
For instance, the minimal corruption and high levels of safety that Kigali enjoys are mostly a&#13;
result of efforts undertaken at the national level.&#13;
&#13;
Yet some of these factors can be attributed to the city, and have given Kigali a unique&#13;
competitive advantage within the region. The efforts to make Kigali a â&#128;&#156;clean cityâ&#128;&#157; started&#13;
during the recovery period, when the cityâ&#128;&#153;s first Mayor after the Genocide, Rose Kabuye (1994-&#13;
1998) was tasked with rebuilding the city. Kigali was in ruins, and while rebuilding institutions&#13;
was important, Mayor Kabuye decided that the city needed to be cleaned in order for business&#13;
activity to resume. Kabuye hired women heads of household who were eager to find work and&#13;
                                                                                                131&#13;
&amp;#12;had them begin to clean the streets of the city. The women were paid with food rations from the&#13;
World Food Program and each day, more women showed up to clean.&#13;
&#13;
Eventually the city rebuilt its markets and invested in infrastructure, but the tradition of&#13;
keeping the city clean has remained. The city began to take pride in the cleanliness of its&#13;
streets and became acutely aware that this had become a positive distinction from other cities in&#13;
the region. Thus, long after the recovery period, Kigali maintained its focus on keeping the city&#13;
clean. Donors like the World Bank provided funding for garbage trucks, cooperatives were hired&#13;
to maintain clean streets, and even businesses could invest in the upkeep and care of major&#13;
throughways. Individual residents began to take pride in their city, and contributed to the upkeep;&#13;
for example, all residents spend the last Saturday of every month cleaning alongside their&#13;
neighbors (referred to as Umuganda). Residents also pay into community funds for local security&#13;
forces to maintain the secure environment they have come to expect.&#13;
&#13;
Kigali has benefitted from these small, but important, advantages; most notably, by&#13;
attracting foreign investors. Investors and foreign businesses began to take note of Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
liveable environment and cited cleanliness, safety, minimal corruption and low traffic as key&#13;
factors in their decisions to invest and to stay (e.g. place staff in country). Kigali also stands out&#13;
against its competitors (i.e. cities in neighboring countries in the region), providing a stark&#13;
contrast from issues related to violence, corruption, and even untidiness and traffic congestion.&#13;
These liveability factors have given Kigali desirable attention, and the city has continued to play&#13;
upon this advantage to make the most of its position.&#13;
&#13;
In sum, Kigali leveraged its unique factors to increase its overall attractiveness, by:&#13;
&#13;
     1. Identifying and understanding its unique advantages and investing further in areas within&#13;
        their administrative remit (e.g. paying cleaning cooperatives, enhancing security)&#13;
     2. Integrating efforts with community engagement: community buy-in helped residents to&#13;
        take pride in the cleanliness94 of the city and keep the cleaning tradition alive.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 5: Marketed City Appeal to Investors and Key Actors to Attract New Investment&#13;
&#13;
The City of Kigali hired consultants to help develop an urban plan for the city (the KCMP)&#13;
in 2007. In response to the growing popularity of urban plans, the City of Kigali decided to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
94&#13;
   It is imperative to acknowledge that cleanliness is not synonymous with competitiveness. The incentive&#13;
behind the â&#128;&#156;clean cityâ&#128;&#157; strategy was the need to put things in order after the conflict in order to allow business&#13;
activity to resume and private sector growth to take-off. Once active, the cleanliness efforts built off other existing&#13;
actors (including those inherited, from the national level and the city level) to increase the attractiveness of the city&#13;
over other markets.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                    132&#13;
&amp;#12;develop a Master Urban Plan that would plan for the long-term growth and development of the&#13;
city in accordance with the cityâ&#128;&#153;s long-term vision. The hired consultants developed a Portland-&#13;
style model for the city, planning for mixed-use space and incorporating public spaces into the&#13;
development of the city. The planners even used the Kigali Investors Forum to incorporate&#13;
stakeholder feedback in the design process. The KCMP was submitted to, and won, international&#13;
planning awards that further improved the circulation of the plan and its notoriety.&#13;
&#13;
After the KCMP was completed, individual district plans needed to be developed for each of the&#13;
3 districts in Kigali, and external consultants from Singapore were invited to assist with the&#13;
planning. This subsequent Kigali City Master Plan differed slightly from the previous KCMP; it&#13;
had a Singapore style model that focused on industrial growth and development and was&#13;
intended to accommodate larger numbers of people in the metropolitan area.&#13;
&#13;
The City of Kigali used this Master Plan for more than urban development, but as a&#13;
marketing tool to attract new investors. The city used the KCMP actively as a marketing tool&#13;
and promotional piece at external events. In fact, according to the RDB, most investors that have&#13;
inquired about Kigali already knew about the KCMP and many of the opportunities for&#13;
investment in the city.&#13;
&#13;
In sum, the city boosted successfully interest and investment in the city through the Master&#13;
Plan because of:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Design: the plan was designed well with engagement from stakeholders; international&#13;
       awards give the plan further credibility.&#13;
    2. Communication: the plan helped Kigali to demonstrate commitment to a long-term&#13;
       vision and opportunities for investment within the city.&#13;
    3. Dissemination: the plan has been marketed to external audiences via the internet and&#13;
       through conferences and events.&#13;
    4. Collaboration: while the city is in charge of the strategy and larger infrastructure&#13;
       projects, many of the highlighted investments are executed by the private sector (buying&#13;
       and developing mixed-use living spaces, etc.).&#13;
    5. Signaling intent: the government has simultaneously invested in public infrastructure&#13;
       projects in accordance with the Master Plan that signal commitment and mutual&#13;
       investment in the long-term vision.&#13;
&#13;
* It is important to note that there are some mixed opinions regarding the Master Plan.&#13;
This includes concern regarding the large amount of developed office space (questioning the&#13;
supply in relation to existing demand), and the demands on investors after their investments are&#13;
sunk to make changes or alterations to their properties. This report does not confirm or deny&#13;
these statements, nor does it make predictions regarding the feasibility of the plan, but highlights&#13;
the importance of the use of the Master Plan as a tool for communicating and marketing a long-&#13;
term vision for the city (as well as subsequent investment opportunities within the city).&#13;
                                                                                                133&#13;
&amp;#12;Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
The City of Kigali enjoyed a rapid increase in jobs and GDP because of a combination of&#13;
both national and municipal level factors. At the outset, it is clear that Kigali did well because&#13;
of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s national level improvements. As the countryâ&#128;&#153;s capital it benefited immensely from&#13;
national policies that unlocked constraints to investment and private sector growth. Rwanda is&#13;
one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s 10 fastest growing economies95 and Kigali, as the center of economic activity&#13;
in the country, is growing quickly as a result. However, as explained above, Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s growth&#13;
cannot be attributed solely to national level policies, as the city focused on supplementing&#13;
national level efforts with those of its own.&#13;
&#13;
However, Kigali still has a long path ahead of it, with numerous challenges that remain&#13;
unaddressed. Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s success is remarkable because of the high rates of growth despite a&#13;
(relatively recent) turbulent history. However, the country is still considered a low income&#13;
country (with GDP per capita rates of only $1,380 in 2012), and despite the efforts highlighted&#13;
above, there are several issues that remain. For instance, many local private sector firms still&#13;
struggle to remain competitive and few, if any, have had international success. Further, despite&#13;
Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;liveableâ&#128;&#157; traits, the city lacks sufficient affordable housing for local residents. Thus,&#13;
Kigali has not yet become a middle income country, but the strategies and policies that it has&#13;
used have helped it to grow at remarkable rates.&#13;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            134&#13;
&amp;#12; According to investors, what attracted them most to Kigali was:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Good business environment, commitment to reforms&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Increasingly attractive market- few monopolies, clear land rights and investment&#13;
       opportunities&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Cleanliness and safety that set it apart within the region&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Lack of corruption (and overall good governance)&#13;
&#13;
 And why investors ultimately invested in Kigali was because:&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Responsive professionals in key offices (RDB, Kigali One Stop Shop)&#13;
   â&#128;¢ National and city plans signified a long-term commitment and clear opportunities to&#13;
      invest&#13;

&#13;
Lessons for Other Cities&#13;
&#13;
Kigali is a relatively small capital city in a low income country; its exceptional success can&#13;
offer lessons to other cities with similar conditions and challenges. These could be other&#13;
capital cities; cities in countries with strong, proactive national governments (i.e. with a small&#13;
mayorâ&#128;&#153;s wedge); cities that lack inherited natural advantages; and cities recovering from conflict&#13;
that need to rebuild their city and economy. While this case study does not certify that Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
success will be permanent, it does offer lessons for other cities in how it achieved such rapid&#13;
growth:&#13;
&#13;
1. Cities with relatively small administrative remits, regarding economic development, can&#13;
   leverage national level policies and resources. Capital cities typically benefit from greater&#13;
   international exposure, increased attention from the national level, and the presence of&#13;
   government offices (i.e. additional employment opportunities). However, both capital and&#13;
   non-capital cities can leverage the national level factors available to them, and subsequently,&#13;
   benefit from additional financial resources and technical assistance. Further, if cities have&#13;
   limited resources, they can not only benefit from additional resources, but maximize the&#13;
   efficiency of resources by finding ways to complement national level strategies. Ways in&#13;
   which to leverage national level policies and resources include:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Adopting best practices at the national level and modifying or piloting these practices&#13;
           at the local level;&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Building off of proactive sector targeting at the national level by prioritizing local&#13;
           interventions that support the growth of nationally targeted sectors (e.g. creating a&#13;
           conducive environment for the growth of nationally targeted sectors, or the&#13;
           development of a liveable, attractive environment for new firms and/or universities).&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Tapping into available resources through requests or proposals (or integration into&#13;
           local planning) for national funding and/or technical assistance programs; and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              135&#13;
&amp;#12;2. Cities can, independently of national training programs, improve the capacity of local&#13;
   staff. Cities can independently take measures to improve staff capacity. If local resources or&#13;
   experts are in short supply, then staff exchange learning programs can be an extremely&#13;
   effective way of improving staff capacity. These programs are more effective when 1)&#13;
   designed to address low-capacity areas (e.g. tax collection capacity in Kigali); 2) paired with&#13;
   clearly detailed objectives and specific staff members to receive training; and 3) exchanges&#13;
   incorporate the implementation phase as well as the learning phase (e.g. bringing experts&#13;
   back to Kigali to help staff implement new tax collection tools).&#13;
&#13;
3. Cities can build upon their unique advantages to increase the attractiveness of their&#13;
   city. Cities must identify factors that set them apart, especially from competitor cities, so as&#13;
   to effectively accentuate these advantages. While Kigali may have struggled from its location&#13;
   in a landlocked country and/or its comparatively small labor force (compared to other East&#13;
   African capital cities); it had a unique appeal for foreign visitors. If offered a safe, clean and&#13;
   minimally congested environment with a strong rule of law and a central location in the&#13;
   region. Learning how to maintain these comparative advantages and market them to outsiders&#13;
   was critical to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s success.&#13;
&#13;
4. City leaders can develop and market a long-term vision for their city. Laying the&#13;
   foundation for growth is important (i.e. improving the business environment), but cities need&#13;
   to then advertise their potential to investors. This is especially critical in low income cities or&#13;
   those that are recovering from conflict, as the city might need to address its image abroad.&#13;
   Apart from addressing badly needed reforms, cities that lay out a future plan for the city and&#13;
   demonstrate commitment to this vision (e.g. building outlined infrastructure) can further&#13;
   induce investors by restoring confidence in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s future growth. For example, Kigali&#13;
   improved its business environment and liveability indicators, but relied on the KCMP to&#13;
   outline investment opportunities and market the city to investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Even if not the cityâ&#128;&#153;s core competitive advantage, cities can improve liveability factors&#13;
   to make their city a more attractive place to work and live: Although Kigali saw&#13;
   exceptionally high returns on this investment because of its regional context, most cities&#13;
   stand to gain at least moderately from improvements in liveability. Increasingly, liveability&#13;
   factors like cleanliness, safety and low congestion matter to high-skilled workers. A recent&#13;
   article by McKinsey argues that cities can promote cluster growth when they encourage&#13;
   talent (people, companies and universities) to agglomerate in their cities,96 and cities that&#13;
   have more productive and higher educated professionals have performed better than their&#13;

&amp;#12;     counterparts in terms of economic growth and incomes97. The City of Kigaliâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to&#13;
     enhance and build upon the liveability factors in their city might seem superfluous, but the&#13;
     ability to attract top talent could create a far greater impact than anticipated on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s level&#13;
     of competitiveness.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
This case study of the economic success of the Turkish city of Gaziantep marks the fourth in a&#13;
series of World Bank case studies of successful metropolitan economies around the world. The&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive Cities Knowledge Base (CCKB) project aims to provide city leaders&#13;
with the tools and knowledge for the successful formulation and implementation of proactive&#13;
economic development strategies at the city level. The focus of the case studies component is to&#13;
document not just what successful cities have done right, but how they have done it.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep is a mid-sized city in an upper-middle income country, with a highly manufacturing-&#13;
intensive economy. The Gaziantep metropolitan area has been highly successful in improving the&#13;
prosperity of its residents, both in absolute terms, and relative to other cities in Turkey. In fact,&#13;
over the past decade Gaziantep has had one of the best performing metropolitan economies in the&#13;
Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA) in terms of GDP and employment growth. It has also&#13;
emerged as Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s sixth-largest city, and the top destination for internal migrants after&#13;
Istanbul.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s success story is one of export-driven economic growth. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing&#13;
sector scaled up from very modest beginnings to become one of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s top industrial centers,&#13;
all within a couple of decades. This case study will attempt to document how and why they have&#13;
done so, in the process overtaking much more established production centers in Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
The other dimension of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s success focuses on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s approach to economic&#13;
development â&#128;&#147; supportive local government working in partnership with the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
community to identify and address key impediments to growth. Significantly, the private sector&#13;
is involved both in making decisions about economic development issues, and in implementing&#13;
solutions. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s growth coalition provides a stellar example of diverse actors working&#13;
together.&#13;
&#13;
This report is based on primary and secondary research by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s CCKB team, including&#13;
two weeks spent in Turkey, in August and September 2014, interviewing government officials in&#13;
the national capital, Ankara, and in Gaziantep itself, as well as members of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
community. The report also incorporates Bank staff feedback received at an internal review&#13;
event in September 2014 in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
This report was prepared by Z. Joe Kulenovic, Austin Kilroy, and Can Selcuki, with input and&#13;
suggestions from the broader CCKB team. The fact-finding World Bank mission to Ankara and&#13;
Gaziantep in August-September 2014 included the three co-authors, as well as Jose-Guilherme&#13;
Reis and Stephen Karam from the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Turkey CMU. The co-TTLs of the CCKB project are&#13;
Austin Kilroy and Megha Mukim. Overall guidance on the project has been provided by Stefano&#13;
Negri, Sameh Wahba, and Somik Lall as senior advisors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 143&#13;
&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
With one of the fastest growing metropolitan economies in the world, Gaziantep is a city&#13;
which has literally exported its way to prosperity. Its economic success story is dominated by&#13;
indigenous light manufacturing firms, which now sell their products in some 175 countries&#13;
around the globe. Some top-level numbers are simply astonishing: Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s population has&#13;
grown from just 600,000 as recently as 1990, to about 2 million inhabitants today; merchandise&#13;
exports increased tenfold in just eleven years, from $620 million in 2002 to $6.2 billion in 2013.&#13;
Prosperity is plainly evident in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s streets, and Gaziantep remains a magnet for tens of&#13;
thousands of newcomers each year. This once quiet corner of Turkey has emerged as an&#13;
international manufacturing hub, and increasingly a tourist destination as well.&#13;
&#13;
What are the reasons for this phenomenal economic performance? As is often the case, there&#13;
isnâ&#128;&#153;t just one reason for the cityâ&#128;&#153;s success, nor is its story necessarily a simple, linear one.&#13;
Rather, several elements have combined to create the conditions and outcomes now worth&#13;
examining:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   First, Gaziantep has benefitted from a confluence of several favorable exogenous&#13;
       factors, among them the liberalization of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s economy and its greater openness to&#13;
       trade, modest decentralization of authority from the central to city governments,&#13;
       geopolitical developments in the region, and the cityâ&#128;&#153;s geographic location astride vital&#13;
       trade routes. While other Turkish cities enjoy many of the same advantages, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       industrialists and leaders have skillfully leveraged them for commercial advantage.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Second, local leaders have prioritized ensuring a business environment conducive to&#13;
       company growth. In addition to lobbying the central government for national investment&#13;
       climate improvements, successive mayors and business leaders have worked together to&#13;
       streamline bureaucracy, reduce the administrative burden on companies, and provide&#13;
       adequate infrastructure for production and market access. Being in Southeastern Anatolia,&#13;
       Gaziantep also benefits from comparatively low business costs, including land and labor.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Third, Gaziantep offers a social environment that favors entrepreneurial activity&#13;
       and business growth. The city is recognized throughout Turkey for its distinctive local&#13;
       culture and identity, work ethic, and tradition of multicultural tolerance and inclusion.&#13;
       Although socially conservative, Antepians are renowned as risk-takers, hardworking, and&#13;
       exceptionally commercially-minded. A career as an industrialist is valued much more&#13;
       than a cushy bureaucratic job, for example, and profits are largely reinvested locally.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Fourth, Gaziantep provides a stellar example of effective stakeholder engagement (or&#13;
       public-private dialogue â&#128;&#147; PPD) and collective action for economic development. The&#13;
       cityâ&#128;&#153;s private sector is well developed, with significant institutional capacity and funding,&#13;
       but also a keen interest in shaping the cityâ&#128;&#153;s development. Since at least the late 1980s,&#13;
       Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s business leaders have had the ear of city government, and particularly of&#13;
                                                                                                144&#13;
&amp;#12;         Mayor Celal DoÄ&#159;an, who instituted a series of pro-business initiatives and greatly&#13;
         enhanced the cityâ&#128;&#153;s functionality and livability during his 15 years in office. Although&#13;
         informal relationships remain important, the institutional framework for this engagement&#13;
         is provided by the City Council, a sort of metropolitan parliament in which government&#13;
         and stakeholders come together to discuss issues and formulate recommendations,&#13;
         including on economic development. Its greatest accomplishment seems to be just&#13;
         facilitating dialogue, which otherwise might not happen. On the whole, local government&#13;
         in Gaziantep has been a valuable partner to business, without seeking to dominate&#13;
         economic development, nor does it directly benefit from business growth through&#13;
         increased fiscal receipts, for example. Collectively, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s business and elected&#13;
         leaders have also been able to leverage their political influence in Ankara, acting as&#13;
         champions for the city and securing central government support for such economic&#13;
         development priorities as transport, Organized Industrial Zones, technology development,&#13;
         and capital access and export assistance for SMEs. In fact, in Turkey Gaziantep is known&#13;
         as a city that regularly punches above its weight politically98.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Fifth, Gaziantep has in recent years emerged as a regional hub for Southeastern&#13;
         Anatolia. As the largest, safest, best connected, and economically most prosperous city&#13;
         in its part of Turkey, Gaziantep now acts as the commercial, logistical, and educational&#13;
         center for a vast hinterland with millions of people. It has overtaken previous rivals for&#13;
         this role, and now hosts the regional offices of various national and international&#13;
         organizations, consular offices, donors and relief agencies, international fairs and buyersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
         expos, as well as one of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest universities with thousands of international&#13;
         students and faculty. There are multiple daily flights to Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s main cities, as well as&#13;
         those in other countries (about 10% of total enplanements at GZT are international).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But it was not always thus; Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s road to industrialization has been anything but&#13;
rapid, and path dependency is only one, minor part of its success story. With the areaâ&#128;&#153;s arid&#13;
land ill-suited to intensive agriculture, early on Antepians learned to earn a living by making and&#13;
trading things. Over the centuries, an artisanal tradition developed, in everything from making&#13;
shoes to Turkish rugs. Initial capital accumulation for industrial development came from two&#13;
main sources: cotton-growing (and later textile-producing) landowners, and merchant families.&#13;
Some of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s family-owned companies (including large conglomerates like Sanko and&#13;
Naksan Holdings) trace their beginnings to this era. Industrialization essentially began around&#13;
the middle of the 20th century, with the introduction of mechanized weaving in making clothes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
98&#13;
  For all its purported lack of interest in public service, Gaziantep has often been well represented in the national&#13;
government. Indeed, its current Metropolitan Mayor, Ms. Fatma Å&#158;ahin, was previously the Minister of Family and&#13;
Social Policies in the cabinet of then-Prime Minister ErdoÄ&#159;an. In addition, members of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s parliament (the&#13;
Grand National Assembly) from Gaziantep are reportedly able to effectively caucus together in supporting their&#13;
province, regardless of party affiliation, when its vital interests are at stake in Ankara.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                145&#13;
&amp;#12;and rugs, as well as the small-scale production of spare parts for imported agricultural machinery&#13;
and vehicles. Processing agricultural commodities, a longtime mainstay of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economy,&#13;
also remained prominent. But until economic liberalization took hold nationally starting in the&#13;
1980s, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s development was quite unremarkable, and many comparable cities in Turkey&#13;
did better economically.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep is largely a self-made city; its growth began to really take off in the late 1980s.&#13;
Although Gaziantep has enjoyed much success in leveraging national support programs, it has&#13;
not had any SOEs except for a cement factory in the 1960s. Its success story is ultimately one of&#13;
local entrepreneurs courageously (sometimes foolhardily?) entering new industry segments, and&#13;
through trial and error finding their niche in an often crowded marketplace. Proudly calling their&#13;
city â&#128;&#156;the reverse-engineering capital of the worldâ&#128;&#157;, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s industrialists eagerly learn from&#13;
their competitors, attempt to reproduce the same goods at lower price, then try to undersell them&#13;
in the marketplace. Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s era of protectionism and import substitution did not favor such an&#13;
approach; it was only when market-oriented policies took hold that the entrepreneurial energy of&#13;
Antepians was fully unleashed. They were at last free to succeed or fail! Significantly, failure&#13;
does not seem to carry the societal stigma that it does, for example, in some European countries.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s stellar growth has been driven by home-grown (and often family-owned)&#13;
companies, with very little foreign direct investment or new start-up activity. Of the three&#13;
traditional pillars of private-sector economic development and job creation â&#128;&#147; attraction of outside&#13;
investment, growth of existing firms, and new company formation â&#128;&#147; Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s story is almost&#13;
exclusively a tale of expansion by its existing manufacturing firms, plus the ancillary growth&#13;
accompanying it (e.g. retail trade, dining and hospitality, transport, public services, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
The cityâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing-led growth has had a very clear sectoral dimension: a handful of&#13;
manufacturing industries account for the lionâ&#128;&#153;s share of the observed increase in output,&#13;
employment, and exports. They include carpets, garments and fabrics, footwear, construction&#13;
materials, food, mechanical &amp; industrial goods, chemicals, plastics &amp; packaging, and automotive&#13;
parts. Production is overwhelmingly focused on tradable goods, which are sold all over Turkey&#13;
as well as in foreign markets. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing firms usually sell products under their&#13;
own brands, but sometimes also as sub-contractors for better-known global ones. Production&#13;
machinery is still largely imported, although more recently more of it has been made locally.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the phenomenal growth in trade numbers, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s exports are not diversified&#13;
either in terms of the product mix, or in terms of destination markets. Carpets, clothing &amp;&#13;
textiles, and food products account for more than two thirds of their total value. Geographically,&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s exporters have a very strong focus on (highly volatile) Middle Eastern markets; Iraq&#13;
alone accounts for more than a third of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s total exports. While the city has been able to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               146&#13;
&amp;#12;exploit its geographic proximity, cultural affinity, and market familiarity to grow export sales, it&#13;
is also highly vulnerable to adverse developments in the region, such as those happening now.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s is not yet a knowledge-based economy. Its manufacturersâ&#128;&#153; performance in terms&#13;
of product diversity and ubiquity99 is still quite modest, trailing not just the industrial cities of&#13;
western Turkey, but also fellow Anatolian Tigers like Konya and Adana. Simply put, Gaziantep&#13;
produces a smaller range of products than cities like Bursa or Kocaeli, and they tend to be of a&#13;
more â&#128;&#156;commoditizedâ&#128;&#157; nature, i.e. highly price sensitive and easily produced elsewhere. This&#13;
makes them highly vulnerable to even lower-cost competition from places like China. Still, this&#13;
is actually an improvement over years past. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s producers initially competed only on&#13;
price, but gradually got more sophisticated and started also paying attention to product quality.&#13;
More recently, they are becoming increasingly aware of the need to innovate, investing in R&amp;D&#13;
and new production methods. However, industry-academia linkages are still in their infancy.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s success is not the result of implementing a proactive economic development&#13;
strategy which would prioritize the development of particular sectors, nor was there a&#13;
formal document which would determine these priorities and plan how to implement them.&#13;
Planning for sector development as well as regional economic development has traditionally&#13;
been undertaken by the central government. More recently, some responsibilities have been&#13;
devolved to 26 regional development entities. The one covering Gaziantep (along with&#13;
neighboring Kilis and Adiyaman provinces) is the Silk Road Development Agency. Through&#13;
extensive stakeholder consultation, it has identified development priorities and put together a&#13;
strategic plan for the region, including numerical targets and monitoring indicators. But having&#13;
started operations only in 2010, this agency can be expected to play more of a role in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
future economic development than it has in the period covered by our case study (until 2012).&#13;
&#13;
Despite some devolution of decision-making for economic development to its cities and&#13;
regions, Turkey remains a highly centralized country100. Ankara sets broad parameters for&#13;
regional economic development, and provides some support programs through its local arms (the&#13;
provincial administration, KOSGEB, TUBITAK, GAP, etc.). National policies directly affecting&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s observed performance have included the establishment of Organized Industrial&#13;
Zones, the provision of trunk transport infrastructure, funding for education and research/&#13;
technology development, tax incentives (based on a 6-tier system of regions), and entrepreneurial&#13;
and export assistance. Crucially, Gaziantep has been very successful at tapping into national&#13;
support programs, and in implementing projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
99&#13;
     According to an analysis in the Turkey Urbanization Review, The World Bank, May 2014.&#13;
100&#13;
   For example, only about 6% of corporate tax payments to central government are returned to Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
metropolitan municipality, according to former Mayor DoÄ&#159;an.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    147&#13;
&amp;#12;Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s Metropolitan Municipality has been supportive of economic development&#13;
initiatives in the city, but has left specific business decisions up to the private sector. By law,&#13;
the city government is primarily responsible for urban planning, water supply, and urban&#13;
transport. In addition to infrastructure provision, its main instrument in support of economic&#13;
development is land allocation, a tool Mayor DoÄ&#159;anâ&#128;&#153;s administration (1989-2004) first started&#13;
using to foster industrial growth â&#128;&#147; before the authority to do so was even devolved from the&#13;
central to local governments101. Other specific city-level interventions have included sister city&#13;
partnerships, and urban regeneration/ redevelopment efforts, clearing out slums and upgrading&#13;
public amenities like parks, eventually paving the way for tourism development. There are also&#13;
three district municipalities in Gaziantep, with responsibility for housing, education, and poverty&#13;
alleviation, including assistance to the disadvantaged and refugees.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s two business Chambers, of Industry (GSO) and Commerce (GTO),&#13;
respectively, have played a prominent role in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic success, and form the&#13;
core of a citywide â&#128;&#156;growth coalitionâ&#128;&#157;. GTO is the mandatory membership organization for all&#13;
businesses, while GSO only includes firms with over 10 employees who produce what they&#13;
export. Separated from each other in 1989, in practice there is some overlap in membership and&#13;
responsibilities between the two. Both entities have large professional staffs, budgets, and&#13;
political influence, but are by law required to be politically neutral. They both advocate on behalf&#13;
of business interests, act as promoters for the city, and work with government and other&#13;
institutional actors on matters of citywide significance, their leaders being among Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
most effective champions. They also implement various donor-funded project (such as by the&#13;
EU) and provide assistance to their members in areas like inter-company collaboration,&#13;
entrepreneurial development, market information, business contacts, and export assistance. In&#13;
addition, GSO initiated the establishment of Organized Industrial Zones just outside the city.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s Organized Industrial Zones (OIZs) have been an important, and likely vital,&#13;
ingredient in the metropolitan economyâ&#128;&#153;s export-driven success. Located 15 kilometers&#13;
northwest of the city, the OIZs host more than a thousand companies employing over 100,000&#13;
workers. Bringing together businesses previously scattered geographically, the OIZs offer:&#13;
quality infrastructure (energy, wastewater treatment); expedited permitting/one-stop service&#13;
centers; the clustering of similar firms; and an efficient, less bureaucratic private-sector regime.&#13;
Four OIZs are currently in operation, one is under construction, and a sixth one (larger in size&#13;
than the previous five combined) is planned for a location southwest of the city, and thus closer&#13;
to ports on the Mediterranean. Based on a national law, OIZs exist all over Turkey, but have&#13;
been much more successful in Gaziantep than the government-run ones in Adana or Mersin,&#13;
primarily because of their private-sector characteristics: they were initiated by the Chamber of&#13;
Industry (GSO), forming a new legal entity which acquires land, allocates it to firms, and can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
101&#13;
      Following lengthy court battles in the 1990s, national legislation later caught up with the situation on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                      148&#13;
&amp;#12;withdraw it again if land is not used productively. Firms contributed to the OIZsâ&#128;&#153; construction,&#13;
and later become shareholders. The OIZs are run by 5-member management boards. While some&#13;
of Gaziantep firmsâ&#128;&#153; growth might have happened anyway without the OIZs, it is clear that by&#13;
providing critical infrastructure and conducive regime not available elsewhere in the city, the&#13;
OIZs have played a key enabling role in helping Gaziantep companies to expand, export,&#13;
collaborate with similar adjacent businesses, and benefit from other effects usually associated&#13;
with geographic agglomeration (knowledge spillovers, the development of a specialized labor&#13;
pool, etc.).&#13;

                                                                                            149&#13;
&amp;#12;So What? Summary of Insights for Other Cities from What Gaziantep Did Right&#13;
&#13;
Key lessons from Gaziantep:&#13;
&#13;
1. If the city has a well-developed private sector, involve it substantively in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   economic development. Also engage other stakeholders, and bring them into an&#13;
   effective citywide growth coalition. Elected officials often think of for-profit firms as&#13;
   sources of funding â&#128;&#147; and they certainly can be. But business leaders can be so much more&#13;
   than cash cows: by engaging in dialogue with government, academia, and other stakeholders,&#13;
   they can identify impediments to company growth and job creation, and provide concrete&#13;
   suggestions on how to address them. They can also provide access, publicity, and&#13;
   international reach that public officials may lack. Executives often have immense&#13;
   relationship capital, brand equity, entrepreneurial know-how, and resources that can be put to&#13;
   use on behalf of the city. Meanwhile, the need for institutionalizing industry-academia&#13;
   linkages is well documented, benefitting both educational institutions and companies. All&#13;
   this public-private dialogue may but does not necessarily have to result in the formulation of&#13;
   written strategy documents and implementation plans â&#128;&#147; what matters is ensuring stakeholder&#13;
   buy-in and their solid commitment to act on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s behalf, i.e. process. Productive public-&#13;
   private dialogue and collaborative partnerships can achieve meaningful results, over time&#13;
   helping to put a city on a higher growth trajectory.&#13;
&#13;
    In Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s case, business and government have had a collaborative relationship since the&#13;
    late 1980s. Successive Metropolitan Mayors have shown a willingness to listen to business&#13;
    leaders and address their needs, inasmuch as it fell within the cityâ&#128;&#153;s remit/scope to do so.&#13;
    Land was allocated, permits issued, slums cleared, roads built, uninterrupted water supply&#13;
    provided, and public spaces spruced up, all enhancing the cityâ&#128;&#153;s livability and overall&#13;
    business environment. For its part, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s private sector and its institutions like the&#13;
    Chambers acted as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s public champions, developing the cityâ&#128;&#153;s brand, building hotels,&#13;
    lobbying Ankara for support, establishing Organized Industrial Zones, and most importantly&#13;
    â&#128;&#147; exporting and creating jobs. For its part, academia sought to introduce concrete forms of&#13;
    engagement with private-sector firms, such as internships and sponsored research. This&#13;
    ability to work together for the benefit of the city is a process that can, over time, be&#13;
    emulated elsewhere, of course adapted to local circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
2. Successfully leveraging of available national support tools, as well as of a cityâ&#128;&#153;s own&#13;
   endowments, can provide a meaningful boost to its economic performance. Of course, it&#13;
   is not as simple as just taking funds from the central government, but rather capitalizing on&#13;
   the opportunities that national programs and policies â&#128;&#147; domestic as well as foreign â&#128;&#147; may&#13;
   create. On the endowment side, every city has something going for it â&#128;&#147; location, market&#13;
   access, climate, natural beauty, mineral wealth, demographics, culture, language, history,&#13;
   name recognition â&#128;&#147; that can facilitate economic development efforts and help its private&#13;
   sector create jobs. Endowments are not destiny: success is possible even with very modest&#13;
   endowments. The key is to work with whatever a city has, however modest it may be, to&#13;
                                                                                              150&#13;
&amp;#12;      enhance its residentsâ&#128;&#153; prosperity. And a city can skillfully utilize national support tools to&#13;
      take advantage of the endowments it does have, in order to improve economic outcomes.&#13;
      Gaziantep provides an example of a city successfully leveraging its relatively modest&#13;
      endowments (geography, history, strong local identity and culture) for economic growth and&#13;
      job creation. While no structured process for identifying key competitive assets was&#13;
      observed in Gaziantep, there appears to be broad consensus among key stakeholders and&#13;
      even the general public about what it is that Gaziantep is endowed with that could help it&#13;
      advance and prosper. The city and its businesses have also shown great skill at identifying,&#13;
      often with the Chambersâ&#128;&#153; help, applicable national programs (like financial, technical&#13;
      assistance, infrastructure, export facilitation) that could be of use to them, and accessing&#13;
      them to expand production and sales. Indeed, despite its comparatively low levels of human&#13;
      capital, Gaziantep has shown a strong capacity to design and implement various kinds of&#13;
      projects and initiatives. This is undoubtedly a process that could be replicated elsewhere in a&#13;
      more deliberate, structured manner.&#13;
&#13;
3. Cities can use intentional internationalization as a valuable pillar of a broader&#13;
   economic development strategy. The first thing that comes to mind in the context of&#13;
   â&#128;&#156;internationalâ&#128;&#157; is of course exports. But a city being international means so much more than&#13;
   just selling goods and services abroad. Internationalization as a pathway to economic&#13;
   development has been shown to improve economic outcomes, and ensure more consistent&#13;
   and sustainable performance at the firm level102. Besides trade, internationalization entails&#13;
   the promotion of foreign direct investment, joint ventures, and other collaborative cross-&#13;
   border business relationships. Enabling such commercial linkages is the â&#128;&#156;softâ&#128;&#157; infrastructure&#13;
   for this â&#128;&#147; sister city relationships, academic and educational exchange, consulates, bi-&#13;
   national chambers of commerce, foreign language instruction and cultural centers, proximity&#13;
   to international border crossings (overland, seaports, airports), direct air links, and so on. In&#13;
   demographic terms, having an ethnically diverse population or significant concentrations of&#13;
   expatriates can also be beneficial.&#13;
&#13;
      Gaziantep does not have all these elements working in its favor, but there is compelling&#13;
      evidence that it has embraced internationalization as part of its economic development&#13;
      agenda â&#128;&#147; even though it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t actually have a written strategy document as such.&#13;
      Historically, the city has always been ethnically and linguistically diverse, with a tradition of&#13;
      tolerance â&#128;&#147; the Syrian border is only half an hourâ&#128;&#153;s drive away. During his 15 years in office,&#13;
      Mayor DoÄ&#159;an embarked on an aggressive internationalization program, including&#13;
      establishing sister city relationships, inbound and outbound trade development missions, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
102&#13;
   For example, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, firms in the United States that export on average&#13;
grow 15% faster, pay 15% higher wages, and are 12% more profitable than comparable companies which do not,&#13;
and are also more likely to show market resilience during economic cycles or exogenous shocks. The specific&#13;
numbers vary across countries, but most follow this general pattern.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          151&#13;
&amp;#12;       directly contacting potential foreign investors (e.g. Volvo Trucks) to set up production in his&#13;
       city. Gaziantep University now teaches a variety of courses in English, cognizant of the&#13;
       opportunities this opens for its graduates. And the two Chambers have exceptionally well&#13;
       developed relationships with counterparts in many different countries, helping Gaziantep&#13;
       firms get in touch with potential clients and partners abroad. It is difficult to quantify exactly&#13;
       how much all this has helped the cityâ&#128;&#153;s global commerce, but it has clearly played a role.&#13;
&#13;
The National Context&#13;
&#13;
Belonging to the large, increasingly open Turkish economy has been highly beneficial for&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s growth and job creation. With a population of 75 million and a GDP exceeding&#13;
US$800 billion, Turkey is one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest economies. Driven both by surging&#13;
domestic demand and increased global commercial ties, the country has seen dramatic gains in&#13;
income and living standards over the past decade, with nominal GDP more than tripling, and&#13;
official poverty rates falling from 16.7% in 2003 to 5.1% in 2011, according to World Bank data.&#13;
Across a range of other economic and social indicators, Turkey has made great strides in&#13;
improving its global standing. Nowadays an upper-middle-income economy, Turkey has added&#13;
about five million new jobs over the past five years, helping to reduce its nationwide&#13;
unemployment rate into the single digits, despite a rapidly expanding labor force. As an OECD&#13;
member and candidate for EU membership, Turkey has enjoyed free trade with the European&#13;
Union since 1996, and has benefitted from miscellaneous EU pre-accession funding and&#13;
technical assistance schemes.&#13;
&#13;
Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s GDP growth has slowed recently, due to external as well as structural factors.&#13;
While Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s economy has been one of the better performers among the G20 economies,&#13;
significant macroeconomic challenges remain â&#128;&#147; among them, a large current account deficit and&#13;
external financing needs, a depreciating currency, significant inflationary pressures, relatively&#13;
high interest rates, and a large informal sector. Going forward, its economic growth is expected&#13;
to moderate to just 2% this year, driven by a combination of financial, political, and structural&#13;
factors. Over the medium term, the World Bank anticipates GDP growth of about 4%.103&#13;
&#13;
An improving business climate has provided a boost to Turkish entrepreneurs, as well as&#13;
foreign investors. Turkey has made numerous business climate improvements at the national&#13;
level, resulting among other things in FDI inflows increasing thirteen-fold in about a decade,&#13;
albeit from very low initial levels. The country ranks 44th in the 2013 World Economic Forumâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Global Competitiveness Index, and 69th in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Doing Business ranking for 2014. The&#13;
principal remaining obstacles for investors include bureaucratic and regulatory uncertainty. The&#13;
Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Tenth Development Plan 2014-18 aims to address these constraints through series&#13;
of legal initiatives, including new income tax legislation, a new commercial code, and a new&#13;
patent law. For domestic firms, there is a need to further streamline the regulatory burden for&#13;

&amp;#12;firms with more than 50 employees, as there is some evidence of a â&#128;&#156;missing middleâ&#128;&#157; in the&#13;
Turkish economy (large and small firms prosper, but not mid-sized ones).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Regional Economic Development in Turkey&#13;
&#13;
Uneven growth and population shifts westward present a myriad of challenges. Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economic success over the past decade is attributable to its macroeconomic stability and&#13;
liberalization, greater openness to foreign trade and investment, sectoral support programs, and&#13;
regional development policies. But, for a variety of economic, social, and security reasons, there&#13;
has been a decades-long shift of population from the countryâ&#128;&#153;s less developed east to the already&#13;
densely-populated west. This has resulted in all the usual challenges accompanying rapid&#13;
urbanization, including congestion, pollution, and the need to generate ever more jobs for&#13;
newcomers to cities.&#13;
&#13;
A rising tide lifts all gulets â&#128;&#147; but some rise higher than others. Persistent regional disparities&#13;
in income levels and economic opportunities have long been an area of focused interventions by&#13;
the national government, with mixed success. Cognizant of the need to rebalance economic&#13;
activity from the industrialized west of the country to the less developed east, Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
successive governments have instituted a series of measures to address this, including targeted&#13;
regional incentives schemes, massive infrastructure investments, and technical assistance and&#13;
financial support programs for companies. For example, for investment incentives104, the country&#13;
is divided into six tiers of regions, with the most developed areas (Istanbul, Kocaeli, Bursa,&#13;
Izmir, Ankaraâ&#128;¦) getting the least support (tier-1), and provinces in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s east and&#13;
southeast (Van, Batman, DiyarbakÄ±r, Å&#158;anlÄ±urfa, Mardinâ&#128;¦) qualifying for the highest level of&#13;
incentives, tier-6. Gaziantep province is in the middle of the pack, designated as a tier-3 area â&#128;&#147;&#13;
by far the most developed one in that part of the country:&#13;

&amp;#12;Anatolian Tigers&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Anatolian Tigersâ&#128;&#157; denotes a number of fast-growing cities in the Anatolian landmass of&#13;
Turkey. These cities have become renowned in Turkey and further afield as something of an&#13;
economic miracle, given their location in historically poorer and unindustrialized regions of the&#13;
country. Productivity growth has been faster than in the advanced western provinces of Turkey.&#13;
Relatively unproductive micro firms have grown into more productive SMEs105. Between 1997&#13;
and 2009, the number of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest one thousand firms rose by 15 in Gaziantep, 18 in&#13;
Kayseri, 11 in KahramanmaraÅ&#159;, 12 in Konya; while it fell by 105 in Istanbul and fell by 37 in&#13;
Izmir106. Some of these cities appear to have stabilized in recent years, with the notable&#13;
exception of Gaziantep.&#13;

The rise of Anatolian Tigers during the 1980s coincided with neoliberal policy reforms in&#13;
Turkey. This temporal correlation caused many scholars and policymakers to interpret the rise&#13;
of Anatolian Tigers as â&#128;&#156;a successful model of local entrepreneurialism, which replaced the&#13;
stateâ&#128;&#153;s active involvement in economic development.â&#128;&#157; The â&#128;&#156;organicâ&#128;&#157; rise of the Tigers has been&#13;
contrasted with state-led attempts at regional development in Turkey, which according to some&#13;
analyses of economic outcomes have been largely unsuccessful (or at best have managed to&#13;
decentralize metropolitan cities into their surrounding hinterlands)107. Tiger cities are perceived&#13;
to have seized new opportunities opened to them by liberalized trade and economic regulations.&#13;
&#13;
Thus, Anatolian Tigers are associated with the idea of local entrepreneurialism. For&#13;
instance: â&#128;&#156;When asked what makes Gaziantep a model city, many entrepreneurs and local&#13;

&amp;#12;opinion leaders made statements which included phrases such as â&#128;&#152;entrepreneurialismâ&#128;&#153;,&#13;
â&#128;&#152;competitive, hard-working peopleâ&#128;&#153;, â&#128;&#152;successful without direct help of the stateâ&#128;&#153;, â&#128;&#152;standing on&#13;
their own feetâ&#128;&#153;, and â&#128;&#152;cooperation and solidarityâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#157;108. A well-known case study of economic&#13;
development in Kayseri was titled â&#128;&#156;Islamic Calvinistsâ&#128;&#157;, denoting an analogy made by Kayseriâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
former Mayor and by the head of one of its business associations to a â&#128;&#152;Protestant work ethicâ&#128;&#153; in&#13;
the city: â&#128;&#156;No personal waste, no speculation, reinvest your profits.â&#128;&#157;109 A book written about&#13;
Kayseri     by    its   former     Mayor      was      titled   â&#128;&#152;The     Self-Made      Cityâ&#128;&#153;110.&#13;
&#13;
Entrepreneurs in Anatolian Tigers apparently succeed also because of â&#128;&#152;industrial districtâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
dynamics. â&#128;&#152;Industrial districtsâ&#128;&#153; usually refer to places in which there exists a mutual&#13;
reinforcement between business, cultural values, social structures and local institutions. This&#13;
pattern has been observed consistently in highly successful economic regions, such as northern&#13;
Italy and southern Germany in the 20th century, or the pioneers of the industrial revolution in&#13;
England in the 19th century111. Common features of these districts include: â&#128;&#156;a life ethic based on&#13;
self-help, entrepreneurship, and a sense of local belonging; a regular flow of bottom-up&#13;
innovations generated by the industrial atmosphere; a culture of emulation resulting from the&#13;
mobility of labor between firms.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Is it accurate to frame the success of Anatolian Tigers wholly as a story of a liberal laissez-&#13;
faire state with dynamic entrepreneurs? Some economic historians have argued that&#13;
deliberate agency in economic development is indeed a key part of the Anatolian Tigersâ&#128;&#153; story,&#13;
but that one must look for it at the local level rather than the national level112. Thus Tiger cities&#13;
could be examples of â&#128;&#152;entrepreneurial local governanceâ&#128;&#153;. We examine this theme more closely&#13;
in our exposition of the development story in Gaziantep specificallyâ&#128;&#148;where it seems that&#13;
entrepreneursâ&#128;&#153; success has been boosted by state incentives, and that development has also been&#13;
facilitated by quasi-state organizations such as the City Council or cross-over organizations such&#13;
as the Chambers of Commerce and Industry.&#13;
&#13;
In the remainder of this section, we overview a few Anatolian Tiger cities and draw out some of&#13;
the similarities and differences between them113:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Denizli is located in the hinterland of the larger city of Izmir. Its productive activities are&#13;
          specialized in relatively simple manufactured products such as towels and bathrobes, and&#13;
          it is oriented towards international markets. Development of its industries has stemmed&#13;
          from a history of weaving and artisanal activities; these constituted a base of local&#13;
          knowledge for textile industries, and also created opportunities from capital&#13;
          accumulation. Firms in Denizli have received a number of industrial incentives, including&#13;

&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Ã&#135;orumâ&#128;&#152;s industries are specialized in bricks and some textiles. Development has been&#13;
           largely based on indigenous entrepreneurs. Firms in Ã&#135;orum may have been less&#13;
           successful in reaching international markets owing to the underdevelopment of inter-firm&#13;
           networks in the city.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   KahramanmaraÅ&#159; has grown from its traditional agricultural industries to become&#13;
           industrialized in metal tools, machinery and textiles (including yarn, weaving, dye, and&#13;
           ready-to-wear clothing). Firms have benefited from incentives to KahramanmaraÅ&#159; as a&#13;
           Priority Development Area from 1968 onwards, and from foreign trade incentives from&#13;
           the 1980s onwards.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Kayseri has become specialized in furniture, textiles and metal industries since the 1980s.&#13;
           One of the notable features of its local economy is a subcontracting production model&#13;
           with substantial inter-firm cooperation. Organized Industrial Zones were established, and&#13;
           Kayseri was also granted status as a priority development areas. A special summary of&#13;
           this case is given in the box below.&#13;

       â&#128;¢   Gaziantep has been described using the analogy of a â&#128;&#152;cathedral in the desertâ&#128;&#153; (orâ&#128;&#148;in&#13;
           more evocative termsâ&#128;&#148;as â&#128;&#152;the Paris of Anatoliaâ&#128;&#153;) for its function as a commercial and&#13;
           industrial center for the relatively underdeveloped Southeastern Anatolian Region. Its&#13;
           industries are oriented both to regional export markets (especially northern Iraq) and to&#13;
           international destinations.&#13;

&amp;#12;â&#128;&#152;Islamic Calvinismâ&#128;&#153; in Kayseri115&#13;
&#13;
Kayseri is an â&#128;&#152;Anatolian Tigerâ&#128;&#153; in central Turkey that has become a leader in several industries. It is the&#13;
home for two of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest furniture manufacturers and retailers; a firm that produces one percent of the&#13;
worldâ&#128;&#153;s denim; and a large and successful sugar refinery. One single district of only 20,000 inhabitants (Hacilar,&#13;
approximately 10 km from the center of Kayseri) has a modest appearance but is the home of families who have&#13;
built 9 out of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s top 500 companies. Thanks to its economic success, Kayseriâ&#128;&#153;s population grew from 65,500&#13;
in 1950 to approximately 600,000 in 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Kayseriâ&#128;&#153;s leading industries are homegrown and have rather humble roots. For example, the conglomerate&#13;
Boydak Holdings, which comprises 41 companies including Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s two most famous furniture brands (Istikbal&#13;
and Bellona) and Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest cable factory, was established by a villager from Hacilar who left primary school&#13;
after only one year. He became an apprentice in a small carpentry workshop, then later opened his own workshop&#13;
producing wooden doors and windows, and subsequently moved to Kayseriâ&#128;&#153;s first industrial zone in the late 1950s,&#13;
and has grown steadily since then. Another carpentry apprentice in the industrial zone began specializing in sofas&#13;
and armchairs, opened a retail outlet, and founded Ipek, which has become one of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest furniture&#13;
producers and employs 2,500 staff. The company Orta Anadolu was founded in 1953, and after some difficult years&#13;
in the early 1980s, now develops 300 denim prototypes annually, of which 100 are sold to the worldâ&#128;&#153;s leading jeans&#13;
brands such as Wrangler and Diesel.&#13;
&#13;
These leading firms did not necessarily build on any innate comparative advantage or endowments in&#13;
Kayseriâ&#128;&#148;but rather are path dependent, created by Kayseriâ&#128;&#153;s particular history including heavy state&#13;
intervention. The evolution of the following major industries in Kayseri demonstrates this trend:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Textiles. Kayseriâ&#128;&#153;s textile industries grew out of the nationwide state-owned enterprise Sumerbank, which&#13;
        opened Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest cotton mill in Kayseri in 1935â&#128;&#148;and trained the engineers who became part of a&#13;
        new firm Orta Anadolu in 1953, which has subsequently become one of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s most profitable&#13;
        companies. Total employment in textiles in Kayseri is now estimated at over 10,000 people.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Furniture. Kayseri has no obvious comparative advantage in the production of furniture, given that the&#13;
        forest areas of the Black Sea are far away, and transport costs within Turkey are relatively highâ&#128;&#148;yet it has&#13;
        become the manufacturing centre for Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s two largest furniture brands, and home to a total of 3,500&#13;
        companies in the furniture sector, employing 40,000 people. The rapid growth of Kayseriâ&#128;&#153;s upholstered&#13;
        furniture sector has been aided by the presence of a strong local textile sector.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Metal products. Large public sector investments have included repairshops for aircraft and tanks, which&#13;
        contributed to the development of qualified labor and subsidiary industries such as metal production. State&#13;
        procurement has also played a role: after Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s first cable factory was established in the early 1970s by&#13;
        a resident of Hacilar, the firmâ&#128;&#153;s business increased most quickly during the 1980s owing to major public&#13;
        investments in Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure. During the 1990s the firm transitioned to produce fibre-optic cables&#13;
        and has become a major exporter, employing 2,500 staff.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Sugar. There are 20,000 sugar beet growers around Kayseri producing for the Kayseri Sugar Factory,&#13;
        which makes annual contracts with farmers and provides technical support on production. Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s sugar&#13;
        industry can compete with cane sugar from the tropics only because of tariff barriersâ&#128;&#148;cane sugar in the&#13;
        tropics is produced at half the cost.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to state intervention, key factors in Kayseriâ&#128;&#153;s development story appeared to be: fast-growing&#13;
local markets; and the use of OIZs.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Markets. State investments in state-owned enterprises in Kayseri boosted the cityâ&#128;&#153;s population and created&#13;
        a growing local market for consumer goods such as furniture and textile products. This growth provided a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
115&#13;
  The observations in this Box are the authorsâ&#128;&#153; interpretations of the full case study of Kayseri published in ESI,&#13;
2005.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 157&#13;
&amp;#12;        receptive market and testbed for local production.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   OIZs. In 1956, the Kayseri municipality established its first industrial zone and required craftsmen to&#13;
        relocate there, partly through fear of fire. Spatial concentration was a catalyst for the exchange of new&#13;
        ideas and technologies between those entrepreneurs. In 1959, one of the carpenters began producing&#13;
        upholstered furniture using dried grass as stuffing, and then moved on to foam rubber. In the early 1960s,&#13;
        another company moved on to metal furniture (spring mattresses, bedsteads and frames) drawing on&#13;
        metalworking skills introduced to Kayseri by state-owned enterprises such as the aircraft factory. In the&#13;
        late 1970s, after a trip to furniture fairs in Europe, the Boydak brothers moved from manual production to&#13;
        mechanized productionâ&#128;&#148;and, similarly to the previous technological innovationsâ&#128;&#148;other firms soon&#13;
        followed suit.&#13;
&#13;
Lastly, the role of capable entrepreneurs should not be underestimated. For example, despite the conducive&#13;
environment described above, the textile firm Orta Anadolu was on the verge of bankruptcy in the early 1980s. Its&#13;
turnaround came when new management cut the workforce in half and shifted production to produce quality denim.&#13;
They recruited an engineer from Leviâ&#128;&#153;s US denim supplier to instill upgraded production techniques, and worked for&#13;
six months of experimentation to meet Leviâ&#128;&#153;s product specifications on weight, color and tension. Another&#13;
individual from the same supplier assisted with marketing, and was the first in Turkey to produce a fabric catalogue.&#13;
The firm is now one of the most profitable firms in Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
However, this spirit of entrepreneurship has apparently not always been present. An anthropologist working&#13;
in Central Anatolia in the late 1980s described how â&#128;&#156;villagers must work, but they do not like to; work in any form&#13;
is looked down upon. It is not seen as a way of learning about life, or as an affirmation or fulfillment of the self.&#13;
Certainly the meaning of life is not conceived in terms of work. The exemplary human activity is to sit; the very&#13;
oturmak has both meanings [to sit and to live].â&#128;&#157; Hence, despite entrepreneursâ&#128;&#153; own claims that there is something in&#13;
the blood, it may be more realistic to imagine that a culture of entrepreneurship has taken root over time,&#13;
accompanying the growth of firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National Government Support Programs&#13;
&#13;
At the national level, responsibility for different aspects of economic development is shared&#13;
among several government agencies, including the Ministries of Economy, Development,&#13;
Transport/ Maritime/Communications, Foreign Affairs (trade), the Prime Ministry, and&#13;
specialized agencies like the Investment Support and Promotion Agency (ISPAT) and the&#13;
Regional Development Administration â&#128;&#147; Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP). Over the past few&#13;
years, central government has tried to pursue a more regional approach to strengthening&#13;
economic competitiveness through the establishment of 26 regional development agencies, each&#13;
with responsibility for a few provinces.&#13;
&#13;
National support programs which to varying degrees may have played a role in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economic success include but are not limited to:&#13;
&#13;
1. Regional Incentives: In 1968, Gaziantep was incorporated into the Privileged Development&#13;
   Areas (Kalkinmada Oncelikli Yoreler â&#128;&#147; KÃ&#150;Y) program, granting its firms lower tax rates or&#13;
   tax exemptions for investments, lower labor insurance premiums, and/or cheaper energy.&#13;
   Privileges were withdrawn in 1973, then reinstated 1978-1980. Tellingly, the number of&#13;
   industrial enterprises in Gaziantep increased during those periods. After 1980, Gaziantep was&#13;
   left outside of KÃ&#150;Y, no longer receiving these incentives and subsidies. More recently,&#13;
                                                                                                                158&#13;
&amp;#12;      Gaziantep also benefitted from support under the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GÃ¼neydoÄ&#159;u&#13;
      Anadolu Projesi â&#128;&#147; GAP), but eligibility is limited due to its relative affluence compared with&#13;
      other provinces in the GAP region.&#13;
&#13;
2. Export Incentives: As part of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s national industrial export policies, state and&#13;
   international credits on preferential terms were provided by national or international funds, as&#13;
   well as by banks. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s exporters have reportedly taken advantage of most of these&#13;
   programs, with up to two thirds of firms having benefitted from some type of support, most&#13;
   often directly supporting exporting activity. Currently, Turkish government support for&#13;
   exports is provided for the following:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ R&amp;D activities&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Capital support for product development projects&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Environmental costs&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Market research&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Training&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Employment&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Opening and running an overseas office/store, and the promotion of a brand name&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Creation of Turkish brands in overseas markets, and establishing a â&#128;&#156;Made in Turkeyâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
           image&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Participation in overseas fairs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Investment Incentives: Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s new investment incentives system came into effect in&#13;
   2012. It treats foreign and domestic investors equally, and they are eligible for four different&#13;
   categories of incentives schemes: General, Regional, Large-Scale, and Strategic Investment&#13;
   incentives. Depending on the individual scheme, eligibility for incentives is dependent on&#13;
   region (of which there are six tiers in the country â&#128;&#147; Gaziantep is in tier 3), sector, strategic&#13;
   importance, and size of investment. Specific support instruments include116:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ VAT Exemptions&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Customs Duty Exemptions&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Tax Reduction&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Social Security Premium Support (Employerâ&#128;&#153;s Share)&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Income Tax Withholding Allowance&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Social Security Premium Support (Employeeâ&#128;&#153;s Share)&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Interest Rate Support&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Land Allocation&#13;
       â&#128;¢ VAT Refund&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                                                159&#13;
&amp;#12;4. Incentives for SMEs: These incentive programs are administered by the local offices of the&#13;
   national SME development agency, KOSGEB, providing SMEs with technological, financial&#13;
   and organizational support. Firms in Gaziantep have received proportionally more of these&#13;
   than in other comparable locations, as they are distributed on relatively technical grounds.&#13;
   KOSGEB initially supported only manufacturers, but has since 2010 supported services&#13;
   providers as well. Firms employing from 1 to 150 workers may benefit from KOSGEB&#13;
   support, as long as they belong to KOSGEBâ&#128;&#153;s SMEs Membership System. KOSGEB&#13;
   provides subsidies for the following activities:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Consultancy, tests and general testing/analysis for CE marking&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Technology research and development&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Information networks and e-business&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Local economic research&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Machinery and equipment Ä±ntended for use in common&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Training&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Identifying overseas markets,&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Overseas business trips for export purposes&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Participation in overseas fairs at a national level&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Individual participation in overseas fairs&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Participation in overseas exhibitions&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Participation in locally organized international specialized industry fairs&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Participation in locally organized KOSGEB fairs&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Project support provided for export orientation&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Branding and promotion&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Business development centers&#13;
       â&#128;¢ New entrepreneurs&#13;
       â&#128;¢ The recruitment of qualified personnel&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Computer software&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Patents - useful models - industrial designs&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Infrastructure and superstructure project support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   In addition to financial subsidies, KOSGEB provides entrepreneurial training (more than&#13;
   5,000 entrepreneurs trained in Gaziantep in the past two years), as well technical assistance&#13;
   and know-how, and product development and testing at its own facilities. KOSGEB also&#13;
   administers donor-funded support schemes such those as from the EU. While there are no&#13;
   sectoral eligibility criteria for these support programs, priority is given to firms and products&#13;
   with export potential, greater innovation and R&amp;D capacity (determined through evaluations&#13;
   in collaboration with Gaziantep University), environmental sustainability, and greater brand-&#13;
   building/awareness for Gaziantep and Turkey in general.&#13;

&amp;#12;The Local Context&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep is Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s sixth largest city and one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas&#13;
in the world. It was ranked #9 globally for growth in the decade 1999-2009 by the Wall Street&#13;
Journal.117 As recently as the 1970s, Gaziantep had a population of only about 120,000 people.&#13;
By 1990, that had increased to 600,000. Today the cityâ&#128;&#153;s population stands at 1.54 million, not&#13;
counting approximately 300,000 Syrian refugees â&#128;&#147; a nearly threefold increase in less than 25&#13;
years, and more than ten times the levels of the 1970s. By 2030, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s population is&#13;
forecast to reach 3 million people. The population of the entire 9-district Gaziantep Province&#13;
now stands at 1.85 million, 89% of whom live in urbanized areas. The provinceâ&#128;&#153;s population&#13;
density is 270 persons per km2, nearly three times the national average for Turkey, and about on&#13;
a par with Bursa Province, though still only a tenth of Istanbulâ&#128;&#153;s.&#13;
&#13;
Administratively, the city of Gaziantep consists of three individual districts, falling under a&#13;
unified metropolitan government trying to cope with the effects of all this runaway growth.&#13;
Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality (Gaziantep BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅ&#159;ehir Belediyesi) is made up of three&#13;
district municipalities: Å&#158;ahinbey (population 817,000), Å&#158;ehitkamil (694,000), and OÄ&#159;uzeli&#13;
(30,000). Although Å&#158;ahinbey is home to the largest number of people within the city, most jobs,&#13;
especially those at the four Organized Industrial Zones currently in operation, are actually&#13;
located in Å&#158;ehitkamil. This creates substantial challenges, most notably in transportation and&#13;
congestion, as well as the provision of adequate infrastructure for all the new residents. Much of&#13;
the cityâ&#128;&#153;s explosive growth has happened in an unplanned, haphazard manner, putting pressure&#13;
on land markets, housing markets, and public services. Squatter settlements sprung up&#13;
throughout the metropolitan area, with construction taking place wherever land was available&#13;
cheaply, with little if any regard to zoning rules or municipal infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
The reasons for Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s torrid demographic growth are complex, and include local,&#13;
national, and international factors. In addition to high birth rates (70% of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
population is under the age of 35), the city has been a magnet for migrants from other parts of&#13;
Turkey, attracted by its political stability and economic opportunities â&#128;&#147; the city now ranks&#13;
second only to much-larger Istanbul as a destination for internal migrants. Many current&#13;
residents of Gaziantep have moved there from the east of the country, to escape unrest and&#13;
violence â&#128;&#147; it is the first â&#128;&#156;safeâ&#128;&#157; major city moving westward from Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s volatile southeast.&#13;
However, there are also some 80,000 residents who have moved there from Istanbul118, so it is&#13;
clear that Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s appeal is economic as well as security-based. In all, about two-thirds of&#13;
the population of Gaziantep Province was born there, while about a third have moved in from&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
With a long tradition of trading with its sister city Aleppo and other Syrian cities just&#13;
across the border, Gaziantep has taken in large numbers of refugees from that countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

&amp;#12;ongoing armed conflict. The vast majority of the 300,000 or so Syrians now living in Gaziantep&#13;
province are staying with friends and relatives, some have opened shops and restaurants, and&#13;
their children attend Turkish schools. Only about a tenth of them are housed in refugee camps,&#13;
and the Turkish government refers to the Syrians as â&#128;&#156;guestsâ&#128;&#157;. Recognizing that their â&#128;&#156;temporaryâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
stay in Turkey is likely to be an extended one, efforts are being made to integrate them into&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s social fabric. This is not without its challenges, but this is where Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
tradition of tolerance, coexistence, and hospitality clearly comes into play.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s History&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, with a documented&#13;
history going back some 5,600 years. Located in southeastern Turkey near the Syrian border, it&#13;
is a landlocked city lying some 200 kilometers from the Mediterranean coast. About half of&#13;
Gaziantep Provinceâ&#128;&#153;s total area is mountainous, while 27% consists of plains. Climatically, the&#13;
city sits at the confluence of the continental and Mediterranean climate zones, as well as at the&#13;
crossroads of commerce and cultures. It is a multilingual society, with speakers not just of&#13;
Turkish but also Arabic, Kurdish, and nowadays foreign languages as well.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep has little in the way of natural resources, as its land is dry and ill-suited for&#13;
agriculture; this has played a prominent role in shaping the cityâ&#128;&#153;s mindset and culture.&#13;
Besides the famous pistachios for which the city (Ayintab, later Antep) was named, there are&#13;
some olive trees and other Mediterranean cultures like grapes/raisins and lentils, able to survive&#13;
in such arid or semi-arid conditions. However, the vast majority of other agricultural&#13;
commodities have to be brought in from surrounding areas. The lack of natural endowments has&#13;
forced Antepians to be self-reliant â&#128;&#147; early on, they had to learn to make a living by making&#13;
things and trading them, rather than growing or mining stuff out of the ground. Over the&#13;
centuries, this has played an important role in shaping local attitudes and economic aspirations,&#13;
helping the city develop some intangible assets, including its much-vaunted â&#128;&#156;entrepreneurial&#13;
mindsetâ&#128;&#157;, i.e. the ability to identify and tap into opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Geography has played a crucial part in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s path dependency. Proximity of cotton-&#13;
growing areas (such as neighboring Urfa) fostered the early development of a cotton ginning and&#13;
spinning industry, initially by hand, later mechanized. Over time, this has evolved into&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s modern textile, clothing, and carpet industry, and has played a pivotal role in the&#13;
development of industrial and mechanical know-how locally. The city has also for decades had a&#13;
commodities exchange where agricultural commodities are traded, though they are actually&#13;
grown elsewhere â&#128;&#147; early evidence of its status as a regional commercial and business hub.&#13;
&#13;
Antepâ&#128;&#153;s original prosperity was based on small-scale cloth and leather production, as well&#13;
as trade; its economy suffered badly after trade links with neighboring countries were cut.&#13;
Antep was a very prosperous trading city in Ottoman times, belonging to the Aleppo district â&#128;&#147;&#13;
then the empireâ&#128;&#153;s third largest commercial center after Istanbul and Cairo. The Ottoman&#13;
Empireâ&#128;&#153;s dissolution hit Antep particularly hard, as it was severed from its natural commercial&#13;
area across what had now become an international border. The separation of Syria (as a French-&#13;
administered territory) from Turkey also resulted in significant population shifts, with many&#13;
                                                                                              162&#13;
&amp;#12;Turks from Aleppo moving 60 miles north to Antep, and Arabs moving in the opposite direction.&#13;
Many families, of various ethnicities, continued to have relatives on the other side of the border.&#13;
In addition to dramatic demographic losses in the First World War and physical destruction in&#13;
the Turkish War of Independence in the 1920s, Antepâ&#128;&#153;s economy suffered a severe blow with the&#13;
departure of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s Jews and Armenians, who had constituted its merchant, entrepreneurial&#13;
class119. Renamed Ghazi Ayintab (â&#128;&#156;Antep the Heroicâ&#128;&#157;), later simplified to Gaziantep, the city&#13;
nevertheless embarked upon a swift economic recovery in the 1920s and 1930s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s artisanal traditions provided a solid foundation for entrepreneurial&#13;
development during the first half of the 20th century. With a long tradition of rug-weaving,&#13;
Gaziantep saw the introduction of its first carpet-making co-operatives in the 1930s; technology&#13;
was still very basic, e.g. carpet coloring was still done by hand. Drawing on traditional family-&#13;
based cloth production know-how, a local weaving industry started to develop in the 1930s,&#13;
upgrading to mechanized weaving in the 1950s, which gave a boost to textile and carpet&#13;
production. Processing of agricultural commodities, mostly grown in nearby regions, took off in&#13;
the 1940s, laying the foundations of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s food industry. Construction of the Birecik&#13;
Bridge across the Euphrates River in the 1950s linked Gaziantep with Urfa, reducing&#13;
transportation costs and time to regional markets in southeastern Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
Modern industrialization in Gaziantep had very modest beginnings. In the 1960s, fabric and&#13;
related production switched from traditional to contemporary technology, vastly expanding&#13;
output and enhancing capital accumulation. Small businesses began to emerge locally in the&#13;
repair and small-scale production of spare parts for vehicles and agricultural machinery. But in&#13;
other respects, Gaziantep remained relatively unremarkable among Turkish cities in terms of its&#13;
development. Except for a cement factory in the 1960s (since closed), the city has not had any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
119&#13;
   According to Mr. Adil Sani KonukoÄ&#159;lu, Chairman of Sanko Holdings and current President of the Gaziantep&#13;
Chamber of Industry (GSO), during this period the city lost up to 80% of its industrial know-how. It was the single&#13;
greatest setback for its economy in modern times.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              163&#13;
&amp;#12;state-owned enterprises. Cold-war tensions meant that legal cross-border trade with Syria (a&#13;
Soviet client state) remained miniscule, although some contraband trade did actually benefit the&#13;
local economy and capital accumulation.&#13;
&#13;
The development of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s human capital, particularly in terms of acquiring modern&#13;
production methods and management know-how, was a very gradual process before the&#13;
1980s. A prosperous entrepreneurial class began to emerge in the city, based not just on trading&#13;
but also on production. They began to send their sons to study abroad at Western universities,&#13;
who would later bring fresh ideas and innovative approaches to the city. While the infusion of&#13;
new management talent has boosted Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s human capital levels, the city continues to trail&#13;
the national average to this day in some key indicators like educational attainment (i.e. the&#13;
percentages of its workforce with formal degrees â&#128;&#147; technical, specialized, masterâ&#128;&#153;s, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
The economies of Gaziantep and Turkey began a significant transformation in the 1980s.&#13;
Then-Prime Minister Turgut Ã&#150;zal initiated measures to liberalize Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largely statist&#13;
economy, including the privatization of some SOEs and greater openness to foreign trade and&#13;
investment. These new opportunities were seized upon by enterprising Anatolian businessmen,&#13;
including ones from Gaziantep, investing in new production facilities and buying some SOEs120.&#13;
New companies entered market segments previously held by highly-protected large firms from&#13;
western Turkey, and many firms began to export for the first time. Product quality was poor, as&#13;
Gaziantep producers competed primarily on price.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep firms did not transition from trade to production in the 1980s; that process had&#13;
begun in prior decades, as the city already a long tradition of craftsmanship and textile&#13;
production. However, the 1980s saw many family-owned firms in Gaziantep venture into&#13;
completely new industries, eventually emerging as large, diversified conglomerates making&#13;
everything from clothing to carpets to medical supplies to construction equipment. In addition to&#13;
a national policy framework that created an opening, Gaziantep firms were also able to draw&#13;
upon their profound knowledge of products (being traders) and neighboring markets (being a&#13;
border city). With most of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s exports to Europe and other developed markets being made&#13;
in western Turkey, Gaziantep producers focused on emerging opportunities in the Middle East,&#13;
which to this day takes the lionâ&#128;&#153;s share of their exports.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s exporters continued to grow and scale up in the 1990s. Management skills and&#13;
contemporary product awareness continued to increase, and with them product quality. But given&#13;
the high ubiquity and low diversification of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s products (and therefore its industry&#13;
base), the long-term sustainability of this expansion was questioned as recently as 2000, with&#13;
some economists deeming that â&#128;&#156;the economies of Denizli, Gaziantep and Kayseri are based on&#13;
traditional industries with no high technology base or high level of skill acquisition.â&#128;&#157;121&#13;

&amp;#12;While Gaziantep has made much recent progress, its product mix is still far less diversified than&#13;
those from cities in western Turkey like Bursa or Izmir, and about on a par with its Anatolian&#13;
neighbors122. Gaziantep does outperform many cities in eastern Turkey in terms of product&#13;
diversity and ubiquity, and it may be able to produce what some other cities canâ&#128;&#153;t or donâ&#128;&#153;t.&#13;

In the 2000s, Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s so-called â&#128;&#156;zero problems policyâ&#128;&#157; towards its neighbors did away&#13;
with visa requirements for visitors from many countries in the region, including Syria.&#13;
Syrians were now able to come across the border to Gaziantep to shop or catch a flight, and&#13;
business ties further expanded. Gaziantep firms expanded their presence in Iraq, particularly its&#13;
Kurdish region, which grew to become Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s top export market. Exports of (still&#13;
comparatively low-tech) products also grew to developed markets, but those continued to&#13;
account for a much smaller share of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s total exports than Middle Eastern ones.&#13;
Deteriorating conditions in those countries are now a cause for major concern in the city.&#13;

&amp;#12;Contemporary Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economy is at a crossroads: its traditional manufacturing&#13;
industries like carpets, garments, footwear, construction materials, food, plastics, etc. continue to&#13;
see strong exports, but innovation is low and competition in those industries ever fiercer.&#13;
Tentative steps are being made to develop emerging sectors like tourism, logistics, healthcare,&#13;
and education, but the process is slow and made more difficult by adverse political developments&#13;
in the region. However, awareness seems to be increasing among Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
community that the old growth model may not take them much further into the future.&#13;

&amp;#12;Key Local Actors&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep Provincial Governorate (Gaziantep ValiliÄ&#159;i)&#13;
&#13;
Provinces are the 81 administrative units into which Turkey is divided. Home to 1.85&#13;
million residents, Gaziantep Province is consists of nine municipal districts, including the three&#13;
making up the Gaziantep metropolitan area. Four districts that make up the neighboring province&#13;
of Kilis used to be part of Gaziantep Province, but were carved out into a separate province in&#13;
1994. As the local representatives of the Turkish state, Provincial Governorates are headed by&#13;
Governors. Governors are rotated between different provincial postings every few years, and are&#13;
seldom natives of the province in which they serve. The Governor is appointed, not elected, and&#13;
is the highest ranking civil servant in the province. Answering directly to Ankara, Governors are&#13;
responsible for coordinating the provision of public services in the province, so the local&#13;
branches of all national ministries serve under the provincial Governor.&#13;
&#13;
Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s central government provides the legal framework for local and regional economic&#13;
development and, through the Governorate, carries out its responsibilities for selecting industrial&#13;
sites, land acquisition, and the establishment of industrial zones, as well as the provision of state&#13;
guarantees essential for financing investment projects by the Municipality. To accomplish this,&#13;
the Governor is expected to maintain close dialogue with key local stakeholders, in particular&#13;
members of the local business community â&#128;&#147; a relationship which has not always been smooth in&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s recent political history123. Apart from this, the Provincial governorate is responsible&#13;
for public services only indirectly related to economic development, including:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Public Works: Construction and maintenance of roads outside the metropolitan area&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Water Supply: Provision of drinking water outside the metropolitan area&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Public Safety and Security: Policing the entire province&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Education: Construction and maintenance of primary and secondary public schools&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Agricultural Services: Experimental farms, provision of seeds and fertilizers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
123&#13;
    â&#128;&#156;A businessman interviewed cited Governor Bilgin on his approach to the entrepreneurs: The governor&#13;
emphasized that if anything happens to the business people in Gaziantep, he would be the first to protect them, and&#13;
the bureaucrats serving under him could not - and will not be allowed to - do anything to create obstacles in front of&#13;
the entrepreneurs. Interestingly, the general secretary of the GSO noted that the bureaucrats who are responsible for&#13;
services related to the economy and industry would be isolated by the business community if they adopted a&#13;
negative approach to local entrepreneurs. â&#128;¦ In cases where the governor adopted a more prudent approach, the local&#13;
bourgeoisie took a combative stance against the governor. Governor Erhan Tanju, who served between GÃ¼ler and&#13;
the current governor, chose to pursue such a policy. He openly declared that everyone had to do their business, and&#13;
that he could attend the meetings he had to, but had no time for personal (one-to-one) relations (Yorum 2001 (8)).&#13;
According to HÃ¼seyin Toprak, the editor of the journal Yorum, the governorâ&#128;&#153;s approach annoyed certain business&#13;
people, industrialists, mayors, and certain chambers (even certain directors of the local branches of the bureaucracy),&#13;
who were used to having a close relationship with the higher echelons of the bureaucracy.176 Not surprisingly,&#13;
Governor Tanju was replaced by the current governor in less than two years. Normally, the governors who develop&#13;
positive relations with the representatives of the local bourgeoisie tend to stay in their office for longer periods. For&#13;
example, the governor preceding him had served 6 years. The governorâ&#128;&#153;s weight in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s political-economy is&#13;
very much affected by the nature of relations with the business community of Gaziantep.â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; BeyÄ±rbaÄ&#159;, 2007: 202.&#13;
                                                                                                                    167&#13;

&#13;
Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality (Gaziantep BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅ&#159;ehir Belediyesi)&#13;
&#13;
Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s highly centralized political system does not provide much autonomy or&#13;
administrative scope at the local level124. Though decentralization measures in 2004 transferred&#13;
some authority to mayors for managing public services like urban planning, transport, water and&#13;
sanitation, waste management, social services, sports and cultural facilities, and environmental&#13;
protection125, in fiscal terms cities remain highly dependent on transfer payments from the&#13;
central government. Some remaining structural shortcomings in the decentralization process&#13;
include:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Municipalitiesâ&#128;&#153; low fiscal autonomy, relying on Ankara for two thirds or more of their&#13;
        operating budgets&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Limited borrowing ability: by law, Turkish municipalitiesâ&#128;&#153; debt levels may not exceed&#13;
        150% of their total annual revenues&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Under-development of bank financing mechanisms for municipalities&#13;
    â&#128;¢ As a general rule, local authorities have little fiscal incentive to foster economic&#13;
        development and job creation, apart from the political imperative of winning elections126.&#13;
&#13;
Covering the cityâ&#128;&#153;s three districts, the Metropolitan Municipality is Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s city&#13;
government, one of only 16 such bodies in Turkey. the Metropolitan Municipality is&#13;
responsible for urban planning and the provision of major public services in the city. It also&#13;
shares some of these responsibilities with the three individual district administrations that&#13;
comprise the city. The Metropolitan Municipality has primary responsibility for making&#13;
Gaziantep a well-functioning, livable city, able to attract new residents and investment. Its&#13;
specific areas of responsibility include: infrastructure (especially water supply and transport),&#13;
urban planning, environmental protection, heritage preservation, public hygiene and health, and&#13;
the coordination of public investments across the city. The municipal administrationâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Educational Unit also has an indirect role in economic development, through its mandate to carry&#13;
out needs assessments/employer surveys of workforce skills needs&#13;
&#13;
The Metropolitan Municipalityâ&#128;&#153;s total budget in 2011 was YTL 335 million (â&#130;¬163 million&#13;
equivalent at the time). Approximate breakdown of revenue sources in 2011:&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Central government transfers: 73%&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Service fees: 24%&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Local taxes: 3%&#13;

     Regulated by national legislation: â&#128;&#156;Law of Metropolitan Municipalities No 5216â&#128;&#157; (BÃ¼yÃ¼kÄ¢ehir Belediye&#13;
Kanunu) and the â&#128;&#156;Law of Municipalities No 5393 (Belediye Kanunu), as well as complementary regulations and&#13;
bylaws.&#13;
126&#13;
     According to former Gaziantep Metropolitan Mayor Celal DoÄ&#159;an, interviewed in September 2014, cities&#13;
reportedly get back only 6% of the value paid in business taxes to Ankara by companies in their jurisdiction.&#13;
                                                                                                        168&#13;
&amp;#12;The Metropolitan Municipality does not provide services to the Organized Industrial&#13;
Zones, as they lie outside its jurisdiction. However, successive Metropolitan Mayors have&#13;
strongly supported the OIZsâ&#128;&#153; development through advocacy and influence on other tiers of&#13;
government, as well as partnerships with the Chambers and other private-sector actors.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s most senior elected official is the Metropolitan Mayor. Elected for a five-year&#13;
term in office, the Mayor heads the municipal administration and is its chief executive. While the&#13;
Mayor does not have direct responsibility for economic development â&#128;&#147; nor does the Metropolitan&#13;
Municipality get higher tax revenues if economic development occurs in the city â&#128;&#147; successive&#13;
mayors have understood the importance of job creation for their public approval and re-election&#13;
prospects. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s mayors have traditionally enjoyed much political influence in Ankara127,&#13;
and since the late 1980s have had much improved relations with the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business community,&#13;
collaborating quite effectively to advance the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development.&#13;
&#13;
Mayor Celal DoÄ&#159;an, a self-described â&#128;&#156;free market socialist who believes in limited&#13;
governmentâ&#128;&#157;, was first elected to that office in 1989, and subsequently re-elected in 1994&#13;
and 1999. Mayor DoÄ&#159;anâ&#128;&#153;s 15-year term in office was truly transformational on a number of&#13;
levels, including a doubling of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s population, and through this its emergence as one of&#13;
Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest cities. It was during this period that Gaziantep resolved some of it most acute&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks (e.g. having running water only one day a week in the early 1990s), so&#13;
industrial production really began to take off. The DoÄ&#159;an years coincided with a change in&#13;
composition of the Municipal Council towards stronger representation of the business&#13;
community, and a shift in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s overall ideological atmosphere from leftist towards&#13;
market-oriented (neo)liberalism. The Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s often-repeated slogan was that he was â&#128;&#156;the mayor&#13;
of the whole city, not just his own (social-democratic) partyâ&#128;&#157;, and made a point of treating all&#13;
citizens equally, irrespective of ethnicity (this while elsewhere in the country Kurds and Turks&#13;
were shooting at each other). Many people moved to Gaziantep from Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s troubled southeast&#13;
during this period, including entrepreneurs with lots of know-how and investment capital.&#13;
&#13;
Mayor DoÄ&#159;an made economic development a top priority for the city. Early in his term, he&#13;
convened 115 small manufacturers, pledging that the city would supply all the infrastructure they&#13;
need as long as they continue production, creating jobs. He also asked Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s citizens for&#13;
sacrifices â&#128;&#147; for example, residential users paid more for water use than industrial ones, because&#13;
industrial growth was so vitally important to the city (in essence, cross-subsidies and preferential&#13;
utility rates as a form of economic development incentive). DoÄ&#159;anâ&#128;&#153;s proactive interventions to&#13;
strengthen Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economy can be summarized as follows:&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Physical Infrastructure: Mayor DoÄ&#159;an understood that a lack of adequate infrastructure&#13;
         was perhaps the greatest impediment for local businesses to expand and create jobs. In&#13;
         addition to providing uninterrupted water supply and roads, the Municipality intervened&#13;
         in specific instances to ensure that markets can function and companies can do what they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
127&#13;
    The current Mayor, Fatma Å&#158;ahin, was a minister in the national government; former mayor DoÄ&#159;an was a close&#13;
friend of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s Prime Minister (later President) Suleyman Demirel.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            169&#13;
&amp;#12;           do best â&#128;&#147; with impressive results128. Land allocation was one of the key instruments at&#13;
           the Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s disposal. Initially, the city was willing to help any company to obtain land if&#13;
           it promised to create jobs; as Gaziantep became more prosperous, the Municipality began&#13;
           to prioritize land allocation for businesses focused on high value-added activities (though&#13;
           this selection appears to have been random, without any systematic criteria).&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Pro-Business Environment: DoÄ&#159;an sought to cut red tape and streamline bureaucratic&#13;
           procedures that were stifling business growth in the city. One of his proudest&#13;
           accomplishments was slashing the city bureaucracy, from 2,700 employees to only about&#13;
           a hundred, largely through attrition â&#128;&#147; his view was that the Municipalityâ&#128;&#153;s job was not to&#13;
           provide jobs for political cronies. He also lobbied the national government in Ankara, to&#13;
           whom had direct access, for specific nationwide business-friendly reforms. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t see&#13;
           it as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s job to pick winners or losers, just to â&#128;&#156;create an enabling environment, in&#13;
           which everyone feels like a citizen, that they can succeedâ&#128;&#157;. 129 This resonated rather well&#13;
           with Antepiansâ&#128;&#153; instinctive entrepreneurialism, and won him a lot of support130.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Quality of Life: Gaziantep was not a particularly appealing or livable place a quarter of a&#13;
           century ago, given its severe water shortages, lack of transportation and connectivity, and&#13;
           almost no enabling â&#128;&#156;softâ&#128;&#157; infrastructure for business, such as decent hotels. DoÄ&#159;an&#13;
           engaged in some very activist placemaking, including significantly expanding the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
           parks and green surfaces, tackling environmental issues, and clearing out slums and&#13;
           dilapidated structures not just to make way for new development, but also to make the&#13;
           city a more attractive place to live and visit. It was in the DoÄ&#159;an era that efforts to&#13;
           develop Gaziantep as a tourist destination began in earnest.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   City Promotion: Mayor DoÄ&#159;an was a tireless advocate and salesman on behalf of&#13;
           Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. He organized trade fairs, inbound and outbound&#13;
           trade delegations (in cooperation with the Chambers), worked to persuade investors to&#13;
           come to his city, and established sister-city agreements with cities in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
DoÄ&#159;anâ&#128;&#153;s successors have largely continued this approach, irrespective of party affiliation.&#13;
In particular, the past decade or so has seen stepped-up collaboration between the Municipality&#13;
and private-sector leaders, as well as the institutionalization of this collaboration in the form of&#13;
the City Council. Examples of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s accomplishments over the past decade include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
128&#13;
   For example, municipal housing developments sought to curb rent-based speculation, by acquiring land from the&#13;
central government, having development plans prepared, and then selling the land to developers, especially housing&#13;
cooperatives. And artisan workshops previously located in the inner city were relocated to a new Gaziantep Trade&#13;
and Industry Center (Gaziantep Ticaret ve EndÃ¼stri Merkezi â&#128;&#147; GATEM) especially for small businesses, located&#13;
outside the city; the process was successful because it was done collaboratively between the Municipality and the&#13;
leadership of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s esnaf and artisan chambers.&#13;
129&#13;
      In-person interview with former Mayor DoÄ&#159;an, September 2014.&#13;
130&#13;
    On a somewhat contrarian note, DoÄ&#159;an was often criticized for not responding to the clientelist demands of&#13;
grassroots businesspeople, and instead working only with a narrower set of big names. His image was of a leader&#13;
distanced from populist demands, always project-oriented, and working closely with the powerful names of the city.&#13;
â&#128;&#147; BeyÄ±rbaÄ&#159;, 2007: 199.&#13;
                                                                                                             170&#13;
&amp;#12;       â&#128;¢   Development of a light rail (tram) system: The first phase of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s light rail&#13;
           network (Gaziray) was opened in 2010, with 19 stations and a total length of 21&#13;
           kilometers (15 km from Gar to BurÃ§, and 6 km between Gaziantep University and&#13;
           Akkent). Currently, the light rail system transports about 12 million passengers per year,&#13;
           helping alleviate congestion and pollution, while increasing mobility. The construction of&#13;
           a third, 8 km-long tram line with eight stops, is planned, for a total rail network of 29 km.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Prioritizing environmental sustainability: Gaziantep has been among the first Turkish&#13;
           cities to treat its wastewater, and is planning for further water supply upgrades, as current&#13;
           supply is inadequate for its exploding population. With the assistance of the Agence&#13;
           FranÃ§aise de DÃ©veloppement (AFD), Gaziantep has had a Climate Change Action Plan&#13;
           prepared, prioritizing ecological urban planning and energy-efficient buildings, and&#13;
           funding the establishment of a biofuel plant using pistachio residue, in collaboration with&#13;
           the Technology Transfer Office at Gaziantep University.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Urban transformation: With 60% of the city consisting of scattered settlements that&#13;
           largely ignore any urban or spatial planning rules, Gaziantep is continuing the urban&#13;
           transformation begun under Mayor DoÄ&#159;an. Wherever possible, shantytowns are being&#13;
           retrofitted with basic infrastructure, structures are being brought up to earthquake code or&#13;
           demolished, and green spaces expanded and upgraded. A stated objective of these&#13;
           initiatives is to make the city livable, and attract investment and tourism131.&#13;
&#13;
There is some similarity between the role of the Mayors in Gaziantep and in Kayseriâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
another Anatolian Tiger city. In Kayseri, one of the most vocal former Mayorsâ&#128;&#148;Sukru&#13;
Karatepe, from 1994 to 1998â&#128;&#148;focused on delivering a basic enabling environment for business&#13;
and development, plus proactive initiatives to support businesses. Karatepe focused the&#13;
Municipalityâ&#128;&#153;s work on balancing the municipal books, and on ensuring the efficient delivery of&#13;
municipal services. He reduced the number of municipal employees and privatized municipal&#13;
services. He also engaged in more active industrial support, such as taking businessmen from&#13;
Kayseri to Europe to introduce them to potential business partners.&#13;
&#13;
The Municipal Council is Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s main representative and appropriations body.&#13;
Elected for five-year terms, Municipal Council members meet three times a year to decide on&#13;
such issues as the budget, housing plans, reconstruction programs, tax rates, and fees for&#13;
municipal services. A variety of municipal standing committees, appointed by the Mayor and&#13;
municipal department directors or selected by municipal council members from among&#13;
themselves, deal with financial issues and decide on the appointment and promotion of municipal&#13;
personnel. During the 1990s, there was a shift in the composition of the council from highly&#13;
educated managers and professionals (coming from the public sector, generally with a lower- or&#13;
middle-class background) to businessmen and other wealthier but less well-educated individuals.&#13;
The share of council members with university degrees declined from 70% in 1989-1994 to 56%&#13;
in 1994-1999, and to just 35.3% in 1999-2004132.&#13;

&amp;#12;District Municipalities&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s metropolitan area covers three district municipalities133 â&#128;&#147; Å&#158;ahinbey, Å&#158;ehitkamil,&#13;
and OÄ&#159;uzeli. They work together with the Metropolitan Municipality to ensure the provision of&#13;
public services for residents. Their main areas of responsibility of district municipalities include:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Public Works: Maintenance of the districtsâ&#128;&#153; secondary roads&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Sanitation: Garbage collection&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Land: Land management and expropriation, urban development control&#13;
&#13;
The District Municipalities are headed by mayors, with significant budgets and large&#13;
professional staffs. Their role in economic development is primarily focused on land&#13;
development and allocation. In recent years, District Mayors have prioritized redevelopment,&#13;
urban regeneration, and the beautification of public areas in order to enhance residentsâ&#128;&#153; quality&#13;
of life and attract tourists. The District Municipalities have also taken the lead in helping to cope&#13;
with the influx of refugees from the Syrian conflict, providing emergency assistance and helping&#13;
them better integrate into Turkish society.&#13;

stakeholders on key issues of&#13;
interest to the city. The Council&#13;
seems to have played a catalytic                                                   Assembly&#13;
role in engaging stakeholders in                                      -- 225 members&#13;

&amp;#12;its role in coming up with formal recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep is relatively unusual in Turkey in its effective use of a City Council structure.&#13;
National legislation enacted in 2006 provides for the establishment of City Councils as de-facto&#13;
metropolitan parliaments; but collaboration among Gaziantep stakeholders predates this national&#13;
legislation, and was established in the 1990s. During discussions with the previous Chair of the&#13;
City Council, we were informed that Antalya and Bursa also have good examples of City&#13;
Councils.&#13;
&#13;
What factors make the City Council different and effective in Gaziantep?&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Broad and deep membership, combined with well-defined institutional structure. As&#13;
          shown above, the assembly has 225 members drawn from a wide variety of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
          main stakeholder groups. Sub-committees are assigned to work on issues of particular&#13;
          importance134, and then report back to the Executive Board, who share the conclusions&#13;
          with the Assembly. The Assembly meets once every two months; the Executive Board&#13;
          meets once a month; and the sub-committees meet approximately once a week or once a&#13;
          fortnight. The Councilâ&#128;&#153;s discussions on key issues affecting Gaziantep may help explain&#13;
          the pattern observed by many outsiders about Gaziantep, that Antepians â&#128;&#156;speak with one&#13;
          mindâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Chair as a city â&#128;&#152;championâ&#128;&#153;. The Chairs of the Council have been influential figures in&#13;
          the cityâ&#128;&#148;before, during and after their tenures (for example: the current Chair of the City&#13;
          council was previously President of the GTO for 22 years. The prior Chair from 2006 to&#13;
          2014 was also Rector of Gaziantep University and continues as such). According to&#13;
          interviews with the Chairs, they used their role to set a frame for the City Council to be&#13;
          an advisor to the Municipal Municipality in the sense that it should be supra-political and&#13;
          rise above conflicts. Hence the Chairs have been leaders while trying to avoid&#13;
          provocation and partisanship.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Parallel governance structure to the Metropolitan Municipality? As noted above,&#13;
          City Councils could be perceived as de facto metropolitan parliaments, which run&#13;
          alongside the Municipalityâ&#128;&#153;s elected officials and technical staff. As such the City&#13;
          Council could be considered as a check and balance on the actions of the Municipality, to&#13;
          scrutinize its actions and maintain timely progress. A priori, there could be a risk of the&#13;
          City Council becoming only a forum for lobbying of other bodies. On the information&#13;
          collected so far, the positive and constructive tone set by the Chair may be one of the&#13;
          main ways in which that risk has been mitigated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
134&#13;
   These issues appear to be defined rather broadly; we were told they include: infrastructure and transportation;&#13;
disaster and crisis management; environment; education; culture &amp; arts, industry &amp; trade; popular culture of&#13;
Gaziantep; healthcare; tourism; the EU and foreign relations; small shopkeepers and businesses; historical and&#13;
cultural heritage; ethnic councils of migrants; social life in Gaziantep; international visibility; and local press and&#13;
media.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  173&#13;
&amp;#12;The City Council is relatively cheap to run, and leverages a small permanent staff of only&#13;
three people. Their work is mainly concerned with organizing meetings; while the University&#13;
Rector was Chair, he also leveraged university staff to provide research on technical topics that&#13;
could inform the City Councilâ&#128;&#153;s discussions, and for additional administrative support.&#13;
&#13;
The City Council structure is not fixed, and continues to be reformed under its new Chair&#13;
to formalize the role of decision-makers. The current Chair of the City Council has established&#13;
an Executive Board of 16 members, which includes more formal decision makersâ&#128;&#148;including the&#13;
Presidents of the GTO, GSO, Commodities Exchange, Exporters Association, the heads of all&#13;
major political parties, and contributions from all former Mayors of Gaziantep. The Chair told&#13;
us that his decision to reform the Councilâ&#128;&#153;s institutional structure stemmed from a feeling that&#13;
â&#128;&#156;the common mindset is not sufficient: despite the presence of significant reports and efforts, the&#13;
City Council has failed to address some of the more fundamental problems of the cityâ&#128;&#157;. Hence&#13;
his intention under the revised structure was to bring in more decision makers and attempt to&#13;
make the Council recommendations more actionable.&#13;
&#13;
Chambers of Commerce and Industry&#13;
&#13;
The Gaziantep Chambers of Industry and Commerce seem to be markedly more successful&#13;
than similar Chambers in other nearby cities. Membership rates of the Chambers are higher&#13;
in Gaziantep than in other major cities135; and the activities of the Gaziantep Chambers have&#13;
become more professionalized. Both used to be part of a unified Chamber of Commerce and&#13;
Industry (GTSO), founded in 1891. The two chambers split in 1989, and Gaziantep is now one of&#13;
16 cities in Turkey where the chambers of commerce and industry are separate organizations.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce (Gaziantep Ticaret OdasÄ± â&#128;&#147; GTO): GTO has more&#13;
        than 18,700 members (of which 15,270 currently active), and employs 61 staff. GTOâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        activities include: legal obligations such as the registration of firms; industry and market&#13;
        information; assistance with government relations; research on promising investment&#13;
        areas; expert appraisal services on property and machinery; information on international&#13;
        trade; assistance with export documentation and certification; training on ISO 9001 2008&#13;
        Quality Management System; and vocational training. It has 41 sub-committees, which&#13;
        focus more intensively on narrower sectors and meet once a month.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Gaziantep Chamber of Industry (Gaziantep Sanayi OdasÄ± â&#128;&#147; GSO): GSO has 3,650&#13;
        members, and employs 44 staff. Its largest technical department is its industry&#13;
        department, which has 7 staff. GSOâ&#128;&#153;s activities include: knowledge production,&#13;
        including research and surveys in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s main sectors; acting as an interlocutor for&#13;
        international companies seeking contacts; information on legal practices and procedures&#13;
        relating to foreign trade. GSO offers a companies database of all firms in individual&#13;
        sectors136, and hosts a World Bank Library information center, which is administered by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
135&#13;
    According to data from 2002, the following percentages of executives of industrial enterprises were members of&#13;
the professional Chambers: Adiyaman 75%; Batman 89%; Diyarbakir 82%; Gaziantep 89%; Mardin 50%; Sanliurfa&#13;
71%. Figures are from Paksoy quoted in BeyÄ±rbaÄ&#159;, 2007: 180.&#13;
136&#13;
    The database is available only in Turkish, and displays simply the name of the firm plus its main products.&#13;
                                                                                                              174&#13;
&amp;#12;         TEPAV. News articles on its website are posted approximately daily, and each one is&#13;
         viewed approximately 400 times on average. It has 27 sub-committees, focusing more&#13;
         intensively on narrower ranges of products137.&#13;
&#13;
What effect have GSO and GTO actually had on industrial development in Gaziantep?&#13;
GSOâ&#128;&#153;s Secretary General responds by analogy: â&#128;&#156;Would you be the hero if youâ&#128;&#153;re the one that&#13;
gives the order to shoot, or if you are the one that shoots? Actually it is more of a symbiosis:&#13;
courageous entrepreneurs compete in every market, and we support them.â&#128;&#157; 138 In practice, it&#13;
seems that GSO and GTO have an impact on industrial development in two main dimensions:&#13;
&#13;
      1. At the national and provincial level, GSO and GTO advocate and lobby on behalf of&#13;
         firms in Gaziantep for practical solutions that will benefit a large number of firms.&#13;
         According to the GSO and GTO themselves, their approach is different from most other&#13;
         chambers in Eastern and Southeastern Turkey, whose interactions with the state mostly&#13;
         emphasize requests for state subsidies; in contrast, both the GTO and the GSO argue that&#13;
         when they go to Ankara or to a local government, they bring along their own clearly&#13;
         stated solutions and alternatives139.        GSO and GTO have become credible&#13;
                      140&#13;
         interlocutors .&#13;
&#13;
      2. At the firm level, GSO and GTO work to solve industry-level problems and to&#13;
         facilitate industrial growth. Some tangible examples of the impact of this work include&#13;
         the following. First on the part of GTO:&#13;
             â&#128;¢ Industry research and collective services for their members. GTO conducts&#13;
                 research on the problems that firms often experience in certain sectors, on sector-&#13;
                 wide constraints, and on opportunities to assist firms. For example, the following&#13;
                 process was conducted in the clothing sector:&#13;
                  (a) GTO research found that Gaziantep firms were not producing in line with&#13;
                      fashion trends, and that individual firms were going to visit potential buyers&#13;
                      without having done sufficient â&#128;&#152;homeworkâ&#128;&#153; beforehand. For example, firms&#13;
                      were travelling to Poland with a range of sample clothes which did not match&#13;
                      the sizes of Polish customers. It also found that firms were individually&#13;
                      employing tailors and weavers, despite the cost savings that firms could have&#13;
                      obtained if they shared those employees between firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
137&#13;
    For example: â&#128;&#156;Carpets, rugs and floor coveringâ&#128;&#157;; â&#128;&#156; Pastry and baking productsâ&#128;&#157;; and â&#128;&#156;Shoes, slippers, leather and&#13;
leather productsâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
138&#13;
    Interview in Gaziantep, August 2014.&#13;
139&#13;
    BeyÄ±rbaÄ&#159;, 2007: 171.&#13;
140&#13;
   According to a former President of GTSO: â&#128;&#156;The chamber presidents used to be ranked 45th on the official&#13;
ceremony list. ... But, yesterday we met the Prime Minister (Recep Tayyip Erdogan of the AKP) at the airport. We&#13;
had breakfast together. We explained our problems ... It used to be the same with the previous governments, too. All&#13;
doors are open to us now. The MPs are asking us to arrange appointments with the Prime Minister, on their behalf.&#13;
Now chambers have become more influential than the ministers.â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; BeyÄ±rbaÄ&#159;, 2007: 229.&#13;
                                                                                                                175&#13;
&amp;#12;                     (b) GTO recruited a fashion designer to work with several firms, and deepened&#13;
                         its market research to help firms understand what was of most commercial&#13;
                         interest to their buyers.&#13;
                     (c) GTO also acted as an intermediary for potential buyers, in order to reduce the&#13;
                         transaction costs for those buyers of dealing with several smaller suppliers.&#13;
                         Buyers could still choose between firmsâ&#128;&#148;and thus the firms continued&#13;
                         competing on quality in order to satisfy the buyersâ&#128;&#148;but GTO provided a&#13;
                         platform through which the buyer could efficiently deal with multiple&#13;
                         possible suppliers.&#13;
                â&#128;¢   Creation of GTO branch offices in Erbil (Iraqi Kurdistan) and Aleppo&#13;
                    (Syria)141, thus helping to foster exports from Gaziantep to those places. The&#13;
                    offices provide services to firms in Gaziantep to assist them finding local contacts&#13;
                    in Iraq and Syria, and to conduct due diligence on the counterpart companies in&#13;
                    those places to determine if they are reliable.&#13;
                â&#128;¢   Lobbying and organization for the establishment of organized industrial districts&#13;
                    (as well as small industry estates); establishment of the GAP exporters union in&#13;
                    Gaziantep; establishment of an electricity distribution company; establishment of&#13;
                    gas distribution company for the city; establishment of Gaziantep University&#13;
                    (GAZÃ&#156;) and the opening of departments and vocational schools related to&#13;
                    dominant economic activities of Gaziantep.&#13;
&#13;
              On the part of GSO:&#13;
               â&#128;¢ â&#128;&#156;Trademark Cityâ&#128;&#157; project: This initiative accompanied Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s shift from&#13;
                   being an intermediate goods producer to a producer of final products. It aimed at&#13;
                   increasing the quality and profit rates of products, meanwhile defining â&#128;&#156;Made in&#13;
                   Gaziantepâ&#128;&#157; as a trademark and a sign of high quality. The project won â&#128;&#152;Best&#13;
                   Unconventional Project Awardâ&#128;&#153; in the 2005 World Chambers Competition&#13;
                   (organized by the World Chambers Federation and the International Chamber of&#13;
                   Commerce). The GSO Secretary General mentioned that the projectâ&#128;&#153;s goal was to&#13;
                   ensure â&#128;&#156;that even the simplest consumer knows about Gaziantep, just as everyone&#13;
                   knows about the Great Wall of China or the Eiffel Tower.â&#128;&#157;142 GSO argued that&#13;
                   every firm should produce at least one branded product, as a means to increasing&#13;
                   profitability of its production.&#13;
               â&#128;¢ State incentives: Applications for state incentives by firms in Gaziantep are&#13;
                   channeled through GSO or (more recently) the Silk Road Development Agency,&#13;
                   which implicitly also gives GSO an ability to embody strategic priorities in its use&#13;
                   of this role.&#13;
&#13;
GSO and GTO came into being in an environment in which firms in Gaziantep, like most&#13;
firms, are in competition with each other and do not â&#128;&#156;naturallyâ&#128;&#157; collaborate. Gaziantep is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
141&#13;
      The Aleppo branch is currently closed.&#13;
142&#13;
      Interview in Gaziantep, August 2014.&#13;
                                                                                                    176&#13;
&amp;#12;renowned for its local patriotism and solidarity; but according to a former President of the&#13;
GTSO, â&#128;&#156;the solidarity which exists in Gaziantep is a solidarity which competition brings, caused&#13;
by the [fact] that everyone is in competition. Gaziantep is not a city [which] thinks, acts&#13;
collectivelyâ&#128;&#157;143. Soren Hjorth, the former EU coordinator of the Business Centre Project hosted&#13;
by the GTO, claimed that it is remarkably difficult to bring entrepreneurs together in joint&#13;
projects. One reason for this may be the nature of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s industries, which even today are&#13;
generally focused on relatively simple products that do not require intense collaboration and&#13;
innovation between component suppliers and producers144.&#13;
&#13;
Until the 1980s, Gaziantep firms had not fully institutionalized their major forums for&#13;
collaboration. In 1980, for example, it was observed that among the chambers of industry in&#13;
Turkey, â&#128;&#156;notably absent are the Bursa and Gaziantep chambers, which have been in the process&#13;
of organization since the early 1970s but have yet to be established. The difficulties encountered&#13;
in the organization of these two chambers, in part, stem from the ongoing struggle between&#13;
commercial and industrial interests.â&#128;&#157;145 GTSO (a combined Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce&#13;
and Industry) did exist during the 1980s, and predominantly represented SMEs who were&#13;
engaged in cross-border trade to regional markets and services to the local economy; industrial&#13;
producers were in the minority of its members146. As industrial producers grew during the late&#13;
1980s, the pressure grew to break away from GTSO, spurred by a feeling that an association of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;barbers, carpenters, and the car maintenance sectorâ&#128;&#157; could not possibly represent manufacturing&#13;
interests147.&#13;
&#13;
Two important turning points followed, which fundamentally changed the course of inter-&#13;
firm relations in Gaziantep:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ The first turning point came in 1989 with the establishment of GSO, which split&#13;
       away from GTSO. A group of industrialists within GTSO resolved that their needs were&#13;
       not being met by the joint organization, and broke away from it. GTSO then became&#13;
       simply GTO. The new GSO began representing larger enterprises, boosted by the&#13;
       application of state incentives and credits, and was oriented to regional export markets as&#13;
       well as national markets (linking with industrial firms in Denizli, for example) plus&#13;
       international markets (especially the European Union). During the 1990s, GSO focused&#13;
       on executing its legally designated functions, with the gradual addition of collective&#13;
       services. The legal functions included a responsibility for processing paperwork for&#13;
       certain legal permits, the registration of firms, and record-keeping on behalf of the state.&#13;
       The collective services included the establishment of contacts with international&#13;
       organizations (including the German Technological Collaboration Organization, GTZ)&#13;
       and                     professional                    consultancy                  firms.&#13;

                                                                                                          177&#13;
&amp;#12;      â&#128;¢   The second turning point came around 1998, as GSO broadened its focus from legal&#13;
          functions to become a service institution relying on knowledge and qualified experts.&#13;
          These changes were prompted by a study and report produced by GTZ, which was&#13;
          commissioned by GSO. GTZ already ranked GSO as one of the four top chambers in&#13;
          Turkey in terms of effectiveness, organizational efficiency, and political influence. GTZ&#13;
          argued that GSO should prioritize member-oriented services rather than lobbying&#13;
          services, and should focus also on coalition building with key local actors.&#13;
&#13;
          The GTZ report also advised on GSOâ&#128;&#153;s relations with other organization in&#13;
          Gaziantep. It recommended that â&#128;&#156;GSO, to increase its influence, is not to isolate itself&#13;
          from others but to collaborate with them. GSO should try to establish dialogue and&#13;
          should try to create a consensus by working with other social groups and institutions to&#13;
          come up with a medium term reform program which will be attractive to most of the&#13;
          constituency. [It] should be honest with the people. [It] should stay in dialogue with MPs&#13;
          and party leaders, and improvement of its position should be maintained without&#13;
          prioritizing any party. ... GSO, to be able to be more influential in the TOBB, has to enter&#13;
          into collaboration with other chambers of industry, [and] should concentrate on issues of&#13;
          strategic importanceâ&#128;&#157;148. In essence, GTZ advocated that GSO should build a growth&#13;
          coalition in Gaziantep formed from multiple actors.&#13;
&#13;
      GSO encapsulated this new approach in a Vision document that it formulated in 1998, which&#13;
      set its objectives (and ambitious objectives for Gaziantep more widely) to be achieved by&#13;
      2005. These included the objective of reaching US$3 billion in exports by 2005, and formal&#13;
      employment of 100,000 workers149. A new wave of GSO projects was launched, including&#13;
      â&#128;&#152;Active Industriesâ&#128;&#153; (2000) which reconfigured GSOâ&#128;&#153;s structure to include member&#13;
      representation and business counseling; the Export Campaign (2001) which aimed to&#13;
      increase exports of SMEs through research and mentorship; and the Quality Campaign&#13;
      (2003) which provided training on ISO 9000 certification. More recently, projects have&#13;
      included Smart Industries (2009), promoting quality, branding, R&amp;D, and innovation.&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, GTO has also changed over time, especially in becoming more professional and&#13;
providing collective services. GTO was the first Chamber in Turkey to hire staff via an entrance&#13;
exam, externally supervised by Gaziantep University. GTOâ&#128;&#153;s annual information booklets are of&#13;
a higher quality and more frequently updated than the local branch of the Ministry of Trade and&#13;
Industry. In 2003, GTO moved into a large modern building designed to serve not only as its&#13;
headquarters but also to host social and cultural activities in Gaziantep150.&#13;
&#13;
It could be observed that GSO and GTO are in a kind of â&#128;&#156;friendlyâ&#128;&#157; competition, given the&#13;
overlap in their activities. For example, GTO is nominally oriented towards commerce, but also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
148&#13;
    GTZ, 1998 translated in BeyÄ±rbaÄ&#159;, 2007: 164.&#13;
149&#13;
    Interview with Adil Sani KonukoÄ&#159;lu, President of GSO, September 2014.&#13;
150&#13;
    According to Mesut Ã&#150;lÃ§al, head of the GTO since 1984: â&#128;&#156;GTO works as the elder brother of the civil society&#13;
organizations in Gaziantep, ahead of them, showing them the way, transferring to them information and knowledge,&#13;
sometimes solving the problems that such organizations cannot solve by themselves.â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; BeyÄ±rbaÄ&#159;, 2007: 171.&#13;
                                                                                                           178&#13;
&amp;#12;provides industry information and appraisal services on property and machinery. And GSO is&#13;
nominally oriented towards industry, but also provides information on legal practices and&#13;
procedures relating to foreign trade. This duplication and overlap may have contributed to the&#13;
improvement of organizational and professional competencies of both chambers.&#13;
&#13;
One final salient characteristic of GSO and GTO has been their institutional continuity.&#13;
GSOâ&#128;&#153;s current Secretary General in 2014 has been in his position since the founding of GSO in&#13;
1989. The current President of GSO is one of only four Presidents since 1989 (which also&#13;
included his father). Since 1989 there have been only three Presidents of GTO (one of whom was&#13;
President for 22 years), and one President of the Exportersâ&#128;&#153; Association. This continuity marks a&#13;
contrast with GTSOs in neighboring citiesâ&#128;&#148;for example in Urfa, where management apparently&#13;
changes frequently, and thus involves a frequent â&#128;&#156;reinventing of the wheelâ&#128;&#157;151. This continuity&#13;
could of course have led to intransigent or turgid organizations; but given the external changes&#13;
and pressures on GTO and GSO described above, it seems instead to have led to longer-term&#13;
initiatives focused on benefitting many firms rather than distributing personal favors. Indeed,&#13;
GSOâ&#128;&#153;s current President in fact also heads one of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest firms (Sanko Holdings), and&#13;
is part of a dynastic business family; he has in essence acted as a â&#128;&#156;championâ&#128;&#157; for firms in&#13;
Gaziantep.&#13;
&#13;
Other sectoral or professional organizations have also contributed to Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
success, though it is difficult to assess the magnitude of those contributions. They include:&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Gaziantep Development Foundation (Gazinatep GeliÅ&#159;tirme VakfÄ± â&#128;&#147; GAGEV)&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Southeastern Anatolian Exporters Association (GÃ¼neydoÄ&#159;u Anadolu Ä°hracatÃ§i Birlikleri â&#128;&#147;&#13;
       GAIB)&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Chamber of Shoe Manufacturers&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Other sectoral Associations?&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep University (GU) and Technology Commercialization&#13;
&#13;
Originally established in 1973 as an extension of Ankaraâ&#128;&#153;s Middle East Technical&#13;
University (METU), Gaziantep University became independent in 1987. METU had&#13;
reportedly been attracted by Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s reputation for entrepreneurial dynamism, and saw it as a&#13;
good location for its satellite branch, something it didnâ&#128;&#153;t set up often outside of Ankara. More&#13;
recently, Gaziantep University has seen dramatic growth in student intake, now up to about&#13;
9,000 annually; its total student body exceeds 40,000, making it one of the largest academic&#13;
institutions in the country.&#13;
&#13;
GU is trying to step up its engagement with the local community, especially private&#13;
industry. Turkish universities have traditionally not been very open to the community â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
current Rector calls it a â&#128;&#156;glass wall between industry and academiaâ&#128;&#157; 152. Since taking over six&#13;

      Interview with KÃ¼rÅ&#159;at GÃ¶ncÃ¼, Secretary General of GSO, August 2014.&#13;
152&#13;
      Interview with Prof. Dr. Mehmet Yavuz Ã&#135;oÅ&#159;kun, Rector of Gaziantep University, August 2014.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   179&#13;
&amp;#12;years ago, he has made it a priority to address this, especially in terms of sharing knowledge&#13;
generated at GU with the public. University researchers used to expect the business community&#13;
to come to them if needing new solutions or technologies, but now there is an emphasis on&#13;
building partnerships â&#128;&#147; often â&#128;&#156;over a cup of teaâ&#128;&#157;. Some scholars already have very active R&amp;D&#13;
relationships with businesses, and they are the ones most involved in technology transfer. With&#13;
â&#128;&#156;social sensitivityâ&#128;&#157; training for its students already in place, GU is currently implementing over&#13;
300 projects in partnership with public agencies, private for-profit firms, or NGOs. Mutually&#13;
beneficial engagement is further fostered through internships and â&#128;&#156;business counsellorsâ&#128;&#157; for&#13;
students, as well as industry input into curricula design. Finally, GU is represented on the city&#13;
council, and works with KOSGEB to evaluate SMEsâ&#128;&#153; applications for support programs.&#13;
&#13;
The University has prioritized developing international ties. It has relationships with many&#13;
leading educational institutions around the world, and often hosts visiting faculty. Many courses&#13;
are completely taught in English (e.g. engineering, architecture, medicine), enabling students to&#13;
better integrate into the global economy. There are some 2,000 students from more than 80&#13;
countries studying there, and more recently there has been an influx of Syrians, both students and&#13;
faculty; GU tries to help them and integrate Syrian scholars into its own teaching programs. It&#13;
also provides psychological counselling, art therapy, and other social services to Syrians living in&#13;
refugee camps.&#13;
&#13;
In line with Gaziantep Universityâ&#128;&#153;s decision to prioritize the development of industry-&#13;
academia linkages, a technology transfer office (TargeT) and a technology park&#13;
(TeknoPark) have been established adjacent to its campus. Early efforts in the 1980s and&#13;
1990s to foster collaboration between private industry and the University were not successful, as&#13;
there did not seem to be either capacity or commitment to the process. Turkish laws in the 1980s&#13;
strongly emphasized fundamental rather than applied research, but more recently the pendulum&#13;
has been swinging in the opposite direction.&#13;
&#13;
The Gaziantep University Technology Development Zone (Gaziantep Ã&#156;niversitesi&#13;
Teknoloji GeliÅ&#159;tirme BÃ¶lgesi Kurucu ve Ä°Å&#159;letici â&#128;&#147; TeknoPark) was established in 2008 with&#13;
a â&#130;¬7 million grant from the European Union, along with GTO, GSO, and Gaziantep Metropolitan&#13;
Municipality as minority shareholders. This science and technology park focuses on&#13;
commercializing technologies developed at Gaziantep University (especially its Faculties of&#13;
Engineering and Medicine). Key focus areas include electrical and mechanical engineering,&#13;
information technology, software, design, consulting, biotechnology and medicine (orlgan&#13;
transplants, pedagogic illnesses, pharmacology, personalized medicine), food, machinery, and&#13;
textiles. Stated targets for the next five years:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Establishment or attraction of more than 200 qualified companies&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Employment of over 4000 qualified R&amp;D and software development staff&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Development of advanced technologies with a value added of more than USD1 billion&#13;
    â&#128;¢ will provide benefits beyond import substitution exports of&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Contribution to increase exports or reduced imports with an annual value of more than&#13;
        USD100 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                180&#13;
&amp;#12;An ongoing debate at GU has been whether TeknoPark should focus on assisting existing&#13;
businesses, or starting new ones? A consensus seems to be emerging that it should probably try&#13;
to do both. TeknoPark often deals with old-school Gaziantep manufacturing firms, who donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
know how to do R&amp;D, or even to assess their needs. Traditionally, there has been no&#13;
intermediary in Gaziantep to facilitate this interaction. However, with the younger generation of&#13;
managers educated abroad taking over, this is gradually improving.&#13;
&#13;
GUâ&#128;&#153;s Technology Transfer Office (Gaziantep Ã&#156;niversitesi Teknoloji Transfer Ofisi â&#128;&#147;&#13;
TargeT) was established in 2013, after a lengthy consultative process between GU and&#13;
business leaders, in particular the two Chambers, which culminated in a strategy paper.&#13;
Financial support came from Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s national scientific agency, TUBITAK, which provided a&#13;
recurring YTL1 million per year grant, for ten fiscal years, as part of its national technology&#13;
support targets for the universities. Its main areas of activity include:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Raising awareness about technology development&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Office of Sponsored Research&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Fostering industry-university collaboration&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Management of intellectual property (patent application and protection)&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Technology commercialization and entrepreneurship&#13;
&#13;
On the whole, Gaziantep University has primarily helped the cityâ&#128;&#153;s past economic success&#13;
through the education and training of successive generations of graduates, but much less so&#13;
through the development of new technologies transferred and successfully commercialized&#13;
by local industry. However, as the level of engagement continues to increase and industry-&#13;
academia linkages deepen, GU and its affiliates can be expected to provide a more significant&#13;
contribution to Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s transition to a knowledge-intensive economy. Both TeknoPark and&#13;
TargeT will be important facilitators in this process.&#13;
&#13;
Organized Industrial Zones (OIZs)&#13;
&#13;
More than 100,000 workers are employed in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s Organized Industrial Zones. The&#13;
OIZs cover a land area of 43 square kilometers, and are located 15 kilometers north-west of the&#13;
city. The OIZs host approximately 1,060 firms; and when the most recent OIZ was recently&#13;
built, it was oversubscribed with applications from around 1,500 firms for new plots. A&#13;
summary of the main features of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s five OIZs is shown in Table 1 below.&#13;

Five existing OIZs cover a large land area to the north-west of the city;&#13;
a sixth OIZ will be built 35 kilometers to the south of the city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Have OIZs been a cause or symptom of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic success? OIZs have grown in&#13;
size and number as Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s firms have grown. Have OIZs actually helped those firms to&#13;
grow? The table below summarizes the factors that make it easier for firms to do business.&#13;
 OIZs provide an enabling environment for Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s industrial enterprises&#13;

                                               reductions, and customs tax support.&#13;
&#13;
How have some of the usual pitfalls of industrial zones been avoided in Gaziantep? We&#13;
highlight here two main characteristics: close private sector involvement (to configure the Zones&#13;
relevantly); and land regulations to incentivize production (and mitigate the risk of speculation).&#13;
&#13;
       (a) OIZs are formed in response to, and in collaboration with, local private sector firms&#13;
&#13;
One of the distinctive features of OIZs in Gaziantep is the way in which the Zones have&#13;
been configured to cater towards emerging industry needs. This could be one of the key&#13;
features that differentiates OIZs in Gaziantep from less successful Zones in Turkey and&#13;
elsewhere in the world. In particular:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ The first OIZ (1969) was opened in the first wave of OIZs in Turkey, and was relatively&#13;
        generic in nature.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ The second OIZ (1987) was established to meet demand from scattered small-scale&#13;
        enterprises across the city. It comprises relatively small parcels, and served the purpose&#13;
        of formalizing the SMEs and facilitating those firms to upgrade their operations153.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ The third OIZ (1994) was rather similar in nature to the second, though with slightly&#13;
        larger land parcels and a larger total area.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ The fourth OIZ (1998) responded to the impressive progress made by carpet-making&#13;
        firms, and was specially configured to host those carpet-making firms plus smaller firms&#13;
        producing related products and intermediate goods for carpet-makers.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ The fifth OIZ (construction began in 2013) will combine space for large firms with&#13;
        additional plots for smaller firms who remain in other areas of the city.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ The sixth OIZ (now being planned) will be as large as all the previous Zones put&#13;
        together, but will be located 35 kilometers away from Gaziantep to the south.&#13;
        Purportedly this is partly because of a shortage of land in Gaziantep (though we could not&#13;
        confirm this, given the large areas of open land close to the city), and also to facilitate&#13;
        more convenient transportation from the OIZ to the newly renovated port in Hatay. A&#13;
        settlement zone for 50,000 is also being planned next to the OIZ.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
153&#13;
      This information was gathered from the current General Director of the OIZs.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               183&#13;
&amp;#12;OIZs appear to have been configured successfully owing to a close interaction between the&#13;
GSO, Municipality and the Governorâ&#128;&#153;s office during their formation. GSO initiates the&#13;
process, and a special Provincial legal entity is established (sometimes called the Special&#13;
Provincial Entity, which is the responsibility of the Governorâ&#128;&#153;s office. The SPE buys land either&#13;
from private owners or Treasury, parcels up the land, and allocates the parcels to those firms who&#13;
apply. Once the OIZ has at least two-thirds of its members with a construction certification, the&#13;
Municipality and Governorâ&#128;&#153;s Office drop off the Management Board of the OIZ, and the Board&#13;
is drawn from the OIZ firms themselves154. This process is arguably better than the state-led&#13;
process observed in some other countries, where the configuration of Zones is prescribed by&#13;
government sometimes without much interaction with target firms. However, on paper, this&#13;
process is the same as the process for all OIZs in Turkeyâ&#128;&#148;so presumably the structure of OIZs&#13;
in Gaziantep cannot be claimed to account for their success.&#13;
&#13;
      (b) Land regulations are configured to incentivize production&#13;
&#13;
Land regulations are configured to ensure that land is used for production rather than for&#13;
speculation. Title deeds are issued in return for a fee, but are transferred to the owner only once&#13;
the enterprises enter operation. The OIZ reserves a right to reclaim the land if the firm fails to&#13;
enter production in a specified time period.&#13;
&#13;
Further, in order to reduce barriers to ownership, OIZ land can be purchased in&#13;
instalments over the course of 5-10 years. For example, a carpet-making firm purchased&#13;
10,000 m2 of land at US$ 55 per square meter. It paid 30 percent of the price upfront, and is&#13;
now scheduled to pay the remaining 70 percent over the next four years in installments every&#13;
three months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
154&#13;
  In the case of Gaziantep, where the GSO and GTO are separate, the GTO is also a member of the Management&#13;
Board.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        184&#13;
&amp;#12;Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Factors of Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep has enjoyed the economic success it has for a variety of reasons. There were&#13;
clearly some things the city did right, while in other instances it benefitted from external factors&#13;
favoring its growth, but over which it may have had little or no direct influence. Accordingly,&#13;
these exogenous success factors are separated out into a distinct category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 1: Exogenous Factors&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s success has in no small measure been enabled by developments which it could&#13;
do little to affect directly, including national trends and policies, geopolitics, and its historic&#13;
legacy. However, the city did skillfully capitalize on some of these to improve its own&#13;
prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Geography and History: Gaziantep has traditionally been a gateway city, located at the&#13;
       crossroads of regional commerce â&#128;&#147; a multicultural, multilingual place where people come&#13;
       to do business with one another. Antepians have leveraged this endowment by forging&#13;
       closer links with counterparts in other countries, strengthening other aspects of&#13;
       internationalization like sister city partnerships and educational exchange, and lobbying&#13;
       Ankara for better transportation links that aid commerce. Although many other Turkish&#13;
       border cities enjoy similar advantages (e.g. Antakya, Urfa), they have not been nearly as&#13;
       successful as Gaziantep in leveraging them to further economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   National Trends and Policies: Numerous individual developments and trends come into&#13;
       play, but a few stand out in terms of impact:&#13;
           o The strong performance of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s broader economy over the past decade has&#13;
               created a macroeconomic environment conducive to company growth.&#13;
           o Turkey has very high rental-to-homeownership ratios, enabling high labor&#13;
               mobility; not being tied down by a home that has to be sold makes it easier for&#13;
               citizens to move elsewhere in search of security or economic opportunities.&#13;
           o Decades of unrest and violence in Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s southeast have precipitated an exodus&#13;
               of people westward. Gaziantep is the first sizeable â&#128;&#156;safeâ&#128;&#157; city on their way, and&#13;
               many have chosen to settle there. This has greatly increased the cityâ&#128;&#153;s population&#13;
               and labor pool, but also brought in entrepreneurs with ideas and capital to invest.&#13;
           o Although not particularly consistent or targeted, the Turkish governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
               regional development policies have helped Gaziantep, through initiatives such as&#13;
               GAP, Turquality, small business and export promotion programs, and&#13;
               infrastructure upgrades strengthening the cityâ&#128;&#153;s commercial access to markets.&#13;
           o Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s economic liberalization, move away from import substitution, and the&#13;
               lowering of trade barriers (including through free trade agreements and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                185&#13;
&amp;#12;                 customs union with the EU) has benefitted cities like Gaziantep, with high&#13;
                 concentrations of producers/exporters.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   EU Pre-Accession Funding and Support: In addition to duty-free access for Turkish&#13;
          goods since 1996, the European Union has provided a range of support programs and&#13;
          tools to Gaziantep institutions as part of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s preparations for eventual EU&#13;
          membership. For example, Gaziantep Universityâ&#128;&#153;s Technology Transfer Office was set&#13;
          up with EU funds; in the early 2000s, an EU-Turkey Business Development Center was&#13;
          established in collaboration with the Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce (GTO), providing&#13;
          consultancy and training for local SMEs; and Gaziantep was one of three pilot regions for&#13;
          the EUâ&#128;&#153;s Small Enterprise Loan Program (SELP), later expanded to 49 provinces&#13;
          throughout the country. These and similar EU initiatives have helped local economic&#13;
          development through capacity-building and the provision of funding.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Geopolitical Developments: More so than many other Turkish cities, Gaziantep is&#13;
          directly affected by what happens in the highly unstable Middle East. In addition to its&#13;
          location close to the Syrian border, its trade patterns are heavily oriented towards that&#13;
          region, rather than Europe as is the case with western Turkey. Armed conflict in Iraq and&#13;
          Syria, in particular, affected Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s exporters, as these are their largest markets. Yet&#13;
          Antepians excel at finding opportunities even in adversity, managing to continue trading&#13;
          with various parties even as the region descended into violence and disorder155.&#13;
          Gaziantep is also the principal staging post for international relief efforts in the region,&#13;
          serving as a base for aid workers, journalists, etc., benefiting the local economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 2: Favorable Business Environment&#13;
&#13;
Over the past quarter century or so, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s political and business leaders have made&#13;
improving the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business environment a top priority. The business environment&#13;
(cost/quality tradeoffs and regulation) has a direct bearing on companiesâ&#128;&#153; bottom-line&#13;
profitability, and for Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s firms this has been an important factor in enabling them to&#13;
grow. Since the late 1980s, the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business environment has progressively become more&#13;
conducive to company investment and growth. Led by a self-described â&#128;&#156;free market socialistâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
Mayor, Celal Dogan, the Metropolitan administration prioritized the provision of enabling&#13;
infrastructure, quality of life issues, simplified regulatory and bureaucratic procedures, and&#13;
enacted other measures to encourage local firms to produce, export, and create jobs. Specific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
155&#13;
   For example, as part of the compensation to neighboring countries for the international sanctions against Iraq in&#13;
the 1990s, Gaziantep was able to get funding and equipment (pipes) from South Korea, used to upgrade its own&#13;
municipal infrastructure, according to former Mayor Dogan who arranged it. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, the&#13;
Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce (GTO) set up a representative office in the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, Erbil, to&#13;
facilitate bilateral commercial exchange and participate in the reconstruction boom in that entity. And even as&#13;
violence has escalated in neighboring Syria, Gaziantep firms have continued to export food, consumer products,&#13;
spare parts, and basic necessities to all sides in that conflict.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               186&#13;
&amp;#12;business environment characteristics playing a role in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s robust economic performance&#13;
include:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Cost-Competitive Business Location: Gaziantep has â&#128;&#156;Anatolianâ&#128;&#157; (i.e. relatively low)&#13;
          production costs, including wage levels significantly lower than in western Turkey156.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Land Availability: Although local land prices have increased substantially in recent&#13;
          years, there is still ample availability of inexpensive industrially-serviced land, especially&#13;
          in the Organized Industrial Zones, at much lower cost than in western Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Regulatory Environment: Turkey as a whole has made significant improvements in&#13;
          recent years to streamline its administrative procedures for business. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s leaders&#13;
          too are well aware of the need for a simple, predictable regulatory environment, and have&#13;
          instituted a less bureaucratic one-stop administrative process in the OIZs (expedited&#13;
          permitting/one-stop service centers, a streamlined and efficient private-sector regime).&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Adequate Physical Infrastructure: Gaziantep currently has four operational OIZs, a fifth&#13;
          one under construction, and a sixth one â&#128;&#147; larger in surface than the previous five&#13;
          combined â&#128;&#147; in planning stages157. The OIZs offer energy (electricity and natural gas),&#13;
          advanced wastewater treatment facilities, as well as the clustering of similar firms. Local&#13;
          firms also enjoy easy access to domestic and international markets, with further upgrades&#13;
          under way. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s airport now handles nearly two million passengers per year, nearly&#13;
          a tenth of them international, and close to 21 million tons of air cargo. Gaziantep is one&#13;
          of the few cities in southeastern Turkey with direct rail service to the OIZs. And highway&#13;
          access to maritime ports in Hatay is being improved through a massive tunneling and&#13;
          road-building project that will shorten the trip by about a hundred miles, or 160 km.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Labor: Although Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s human capital is below national levels, local firms do have&#13;
          at their disposal a large pool of appropriately skilled light manufacturing workers. Rapid&#13;
          population growth also means that the labor force continues to expand. In the recent past,&#13;
          Gaziantep firms have primarily raised output by throwing more labor and machinery into&#13;
          production; the transition to a knowledge economy has barely begun, and as it gathers&#13;
          momentum human resource constraints may become an impediment. For the time being,&#13;
          however, there is plenty of available labor to meet local production needs, and it is cheap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
156&#13;
  Average wage rates for workers and engineers in Gaziantep are $590/month and $850/month, respectively.&#13;
157&#13;
   Located in Polateli, some 35 km south of Gaziantep, on the border with Kilis Province. Significantly, the newest&#13;
OIZ will be only about a hundred kilometers from the Mediterranean port of DÃ¶rtyol in Hatay Province, also being&#13;
upgraded at present.&#13;
                                                                                                              187&#13;
&amp;#12;Factor 3: Conducive Social Environment&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic development has benefitted from the cityâ&#128;&#153;s strong sense of local&#13;
identity, tolerance of diversity, and entrepreneurial culture. Companies do not operate in a&#13;
vacuum from the rest of society. Where a firm is founded and expands can decisively shape its&#13;
corporate culture, outlook, market performance, and work practices. In Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s case, the&#13;
cultural milieu has been particularly conducive to business growth, drawing on high local levels&#13;
of social capital. Some characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Strong Identity: Gaziantep is a city with a distinctive identity (â&#128;&#156;micro-level nationalismâ&#128;&#157;)&#13;
          within the broader Turkish nation, a strong local culture, and shared sense of&#13;
          community158. These have been effectively leveraged for the benefit of local businesses.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Social Inclusion: Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s multicultural society is generally tolerant and welcoming&#13;
          towards newcomers. People from almost anywhere can reportedly become accepted as&#13;
          Antepians if they adopt the local values, traditions, and sense of belonging to the&#13;
          community159. Many Antepians actually have relatives in neighboring countries.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Traditional: This is a highly conservative society, with exceptionally strong family ties,&#13;
          and remnants of feudal social structures and relationships160. Together with the residents&#13;
          of other â&#128;&#156;Anatolian Tigerâ&#128;&#157; cities, Antepians are sometimes referred to as the â&#128;&#156;Islamic&#13;
          Calvinistsâ&#128;&#157; given their focus on hard work, savings, and still underdeveloped&#13;
          consumerism.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Entrepreneurial Culture: Gaziantep residents are recognized throughout Turkey as&#13;
          practical, hardworking, entrepreneurial, results-focused, and risk takers. The city enjoys a&#13;
          reputation as a â&#128;&#156;place that gets things doneâ&#128;&#157;. Traditionally self-reliant and without any&#13;
          SOEs to provide employment, Antepians also differ from the rest of Turkish society in&#13;
          being much less ken on public-sector jobs; from an early age, parents instill in their&#13;
          children the virtues of entrepreneurship and profit-seeking, rather than bureaucratic&#13;
          stability. Perhaps uncoincidentally, recent financial data reveal that Gaziantep has the&#13;
          highest rates of indebtedness relative to household income than any other metropolitan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
158&#13;
    Some of the statements on this topic heard by the Bank mission include â&#128;&#156;Antepians eventually come home&#13;
wherever they may go.â&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;People of Gaziantep think with one mind.â&#128;&#157;.&#13;
159&#13;
    The absence of armed conflict or terrorist activity has attracted numerous low-skilled workers from farther east,&#13;
fleeing political instability and violence, but also entrepreneurial capital seeking safety. More recently, the war just&#13;
across the border in Syria has resulted in some 300,000 refugees coming to Gaziantep; most of them do not live in&#13;
camps, but are being integrated into Turkish society.&#13;
160&#13;
    For example, companies often treat their employees more as family (e.g. giving them financial assistance when&#13;
they marry, have children, etc.) than as hired hands. Firms therefore enjoy high employee loyalty and exceptionally&#13;
low turnover rates â&#128;&#147; a worker may spend an entire working lifetime in just one firm. More recently, there has been&#13;
increased competition for the best workers, and talent poaching among competing employers.&#13;
                                                                                                                   188&#13;
&amp;#12;       area in the country. This willingness to venture into the unknown is one of the defining&#13;
       traits of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s business culture, and certainly one enabler of economic success.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 4: Stakeholder Engagement (Public-Private Dialogue)&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep has been much more successful than other comparable Turkish cities in&#13;
fostering substantive collaboration between government, the private sector, academia, and&#13;
other segments of civil society, and translating this into tangible economic outcomes. The&#13;
city has a permanent growth coalition which brings together the main local actors in economic&#13;
development, who discuss issues, develop and implement strategies, and act as Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
champions. This is enabled by an exceptionally well-developed private sector, whose for-profit&#13;
firms compete fiercely with one another for specific commercial opportunities, yet also maintain&#13;
the ability to come together on matters of common interest to their industry, or to the city as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
&#13;
Stakeholder engagement (or Public-Private Dialogue â&#128;&#147; PPD) in Gaziantep has been observed in&#13;
two principal forms:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Direct: This occurs primarily at the individual industry level, and includes the provision&#13;
       of entrepreneurial assistance and training, peer learning and knowledge exchange&#13;
       networks, technology upgradation schemes, product testing facilities, trade fairs, trade&#13;
       development missions, direct business recruitment, marketing assistance, client&#13;
       development, and capital access.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Indirect: In areas where public-sector support may be needed, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s growth&#13;
       coalition seeks to influence public policy and bring about particular interventions, e.g. by&#13;
       lobbying for infrastructure investments, export assistance, regulatory and business&#13;
       climate improvements, skills development, capital access, and other support program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
All four dimensions of the so-called â&#128;&#156;PPD Diamondâ&#128;&#157; are well represented in Gaziantep:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               189&#13;
&amp;#12;Much of the interaction among key economic development actors in Gaziantep takes place&#13;
through informal channels, as business leaders, industry associations, and government officials&#13;
all generally know one another, and successful outcomes largely depend on their inter-personal&#13;
relationships and ability to work together.&#13;
&#13;
The Gaziantep City Council provides an institutional framework for this engagement, as&#13;
the de-facto citywide parliament where the most important issues are discussed. The City&#13;
Council has an influential but purely advisory role. Its assembly has over 300 members, 80% of&#13;
whom from the private sector or NGOs, and just 20% from government agencies. The City&#13;
Council has several thematic working groups which periodically issue recommendations, some&#13;
of which pertain to economic development.&#13;
&#13;
Business leaders tend to be highly engaged in local issues, and often band together to lobby&#13;
the national government. Collectively, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s business and elected leaders have been able&#13;
to leverage their political influence in Ankara, acting as champions for the city and securing&#13;
central government support for economic development priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 5: Regional Hub&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep has emerged as a regional hub in recent years, being the main base for various&#13;
business and policy initiatives in Southeastern Turkey. It has overtaken rival Anatolian cities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to assume this role, and now hosts the regional offices of various national and international&#13;
organizations, consular offices, donors and relief agencies, international fairs and buyersâ&#128;&#153; expos,&#13;
as well as one of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s largest universities with thousands of international students and&#13;
faculty. Higher value-added activities (such as the commodities exchange, or the headquarters of&#13;
large holding companies) are now concentrated in Gaziantep, providing not just jobs but jobs of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               190&#13;
&amp;#12;an increasing skill level and sophistication. From trade and logistics to healthcare and education,&#13;
Gaziantep is rapidly emerging as the de facto business capital of Southeastern Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
Being a regional hub confers some natural economic advantages. Once a critical mass of&#13;
population, economic activity, and amenities is reached, regional centers tend to further siphon&#13;
off activities from rival cities, and assume a more prominent ranking in the national hierarchy of&#13;
cities. As centers of economic opportunity, they attract ever more migration, as has indeed been&#13;
the case over the past couple of decades in particular. Being the â&#128;&#156;naturalâ&#128;&#157; site for many kinds of&#13;
activities feeds on itself, over time cementing the hubâ&#128;&#153;s lead over other cities in the region.&#13;
Examples abound from all over the world, from Atlanta and Denver in the United States, to Perth&#13;
in Western Australia or Auckland in New Zealand. Gaziantep now appears to have â&#128;&#156;arrivedâ&#128;&#157; in&#13;
that respect, and is cementing its status as the largest, safest, best connected, and economically&#13;
most prosperous city in its part of Turkey. This also helps place branding, with increased name&#13;
recognition and international profile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Lessons for Other Cities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantep holds valuable lessons for other cities around the world seeking to grow their&#13;
economies and create jobs. The ultimate purpose of these qualitative case studies is to&#13;
understand what a city did well, how they did it, and which lessons might be replicable&#13;
elsewhere. While every cityâ&#128;&#153;s circumstances are to some extent unique, Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s experience&#13;
provides an example of what can be done (regardless of who actually does it) to boost a cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economic competitiveness and outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Key lessons for other cities from Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s experience:&#13;
&#13;
1. Capitalize on endowments for economic success: Gaziantep provides an example of&#13;
   successfully capitalizing on its endowments (geography, history, culture) to enhance its&#13;
   economic growth and prosperity. As Gaziantep shows, endowments are not destiny: success&#13;
   is possible even with very modest endowments. Every city has something going for it which&#13;
   can be used to advance its development. The key is to understand the cityâ&#128;&#153;s competitive&#13;
   assets, however modest they may be, then with whatever the city has to enhance prosperity.&#13;
   Gaziantep didnâ&#128;&#153;t have much, but it made the most of it, and other cities can as well.&#13;
&#13;
2. Never neglect the importance of having a business environment conducive to growth.&#13;
   Constant improvements to the local business environment, however incremental, are an&#13;
   important enabler of long-term economic performance. Improving the business environment&#13;
   is therefore an economic development imperative. Unless you are a business location with&#13;
   seemingly unassailable advantages (e.g. Silicon Valley, Wall Street), you need to also&#13;
   compete on â&#128;&#156;mundaneâ&#128;&#157; factors like cost and regulation. Since the 1980s, Turkey as a whole&#13;
   has come a long way from having a closed system with rigid regulations and labor rules to a&#13;
   much more liberal, outward-looking economy eagerly tapping into global opportunities. For&#13;
   its part, Gaziantep went beyond national policies in trying to create a enabling environment&#13;
   for local firms to thrive and expand. A city cannot easily change national rules, but should&#13;
   act to improve those within its own remit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Mobilize economic development stakeholders to support the cityâ&#128;&#153;s prosperity by&#13;
   forming a growth coalition. In any city with a reasonably developed for-profit sector, and&#13;
   where the legal and political framework allows it, the role of the private-sector actors can be&#13;
   critical. Enlisting the involvement of for-profit firms, but also other vital stakeholders like&#13;
   universities, chambers of commerce, industry associations, and other elements of civil&#13;
   society, can provide tremendous impetus to a cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. Gaziantep&#13;
   demonstrates the value of building an effective growth coalition to champion economic&#13;
   development and advance the cityâ&#128;&#153;s prosperity, with industrialists and other businesspeople.&#13;
   successfully acting in concert other stakeholders. In this, process can be more important than&#13;
   producing formal documents; indeed, meaningful results can be achieved by working&#13;
   together informally and utilizing stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; external influence and relationship capital.&#13;
                                                                                              192&#13;
&amp;#12;4. Make internationalization an integral part of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development strategy,&#13;
   formal or not. An orientation towards international markets, tolerance of ethnic and&#13;
   linguistic diversity, and building bridges across borders can really make a difference to a&#13;
   cityâ&#128;&#153;s economy. Leveraging historical, cultural, and family ties abroad is an obvious â&#128;&#147; but&#13;
   often overlooked â&#128;&#147; way to do this. As a border city, Gaziantep welcomes foreigners,&#13;
   reinforces existing international ties, and establishes new ones. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s exporters would&#13;
   not have been nearly as successful without such ties in Syria and Iraq, for example, which&#13;
   remain their top markets even amid the current turmoil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Leverage national support programs. National governments often institute incentives&#13;
   schemes and other forms of assistance to businesses â&#128;&#147; whether they be financial, technical,&#13;
   market access, infrastructure, or whatever â&#128;&#147; that can make an important difference to a cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   economic outcomes. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s firms have taken advantage of such help whenever the&#13;
   opportunity arose, led by its highly skilled and sophisticated business chambers and industry&#13;
   associations â&#128;&#147; who not only raise awareness of support programs, but also assist companies&#13;
   in accessing them. The city has also successfully implemented projects financed from a&#13;
   variety of sources, including international ones like the European Unionâ&#128;&#153;s accession funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Encourage the development of a local identity and brand, and make an effort to act in&#13;
   concert when advocating on behalf of the city. This is perhaps toughest to achieve&#13;
   intentionally, as not every city has as distinctive a local culture or sense of shared identity as&#13;
   Gaziantep does. However, it is still important to build awareness of what a city stands for,&#13;
   and how it wants to be perceived. This is beneficial for its ability to influence outsiders such&#13;
   as the national government, while also being good for business. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s political and&#13;
   business leaders have managed to find ways to set aside mutual differences and present a&#13;
   unified voice when advocating on behalf of the city â&#128;&#147; whether in Ankara, or when trying to&#13;
   drum up international business opportunities. A conscious initiative to develop a â&#128;&#156;Made in&#13;
   Gaziantepâ&#128;&#157; brand has won international recognition and awards, so that nowadays the city&#13;
   has emerged as a well-known leader in areas like carpet production, select kinds of foods,&#13;
   and its rich cultural heritage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In sum: know who you are as a city, and how youâ&#128;&#153;d like the world to perceive you. While&#13;
every city has different circumstances and combinations of competitive strengths and&#13;
weaknesses, ultimately it is important to have a clear understanding of who you are and what&#13;
your value proposition is as a location, both on the national and international stage.&#13;

&amp;#12;Industrial Structure of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s Economy&#13;
&#13;
The number of companies from Gaziantep included on the Istanbul Chamber of Commerceâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Top 1000 Companies in Turkey list increased from 31 in 2008 to 50 in 2012. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economic structure is fairly well-balanced between modern and traditional industries, but&#13;
manufacturing undoubtedly forms the mainstay of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s contemporary economy.&#13;
&#13;
Key manufacturing industries include carpets, textiles, garments, footwear, construction&#13;
materials, food, mechanical &amp; industrial goods, chemicals, plastics &amp; packaging, and automotive&#13;
parts. Textile production still has a substantial presence in the local economy, but has declined in&#13;
relative importance in recent years. Most manufacturing is not in knowledge-based or R&amp;D-&#13;
intensive industries, and formal educational attainment of the workforce is below the Turkish&#13;
average. However, there appears to be increasing awareness among businesspeople, particularly&#13;
the younger generation now taking over the reins at many family-owned firms, of the need to&#13;
innovate in existing product segments (e.g. developing stain-resistant and flame-retardant carpet&#13;
fabrics), as well as to move into entirely new industries (e.g. solar panels).&#13;
&#13;
Emerging sectors include tourism, logistics, healthcare, and education (as tradable services).&#13;
With the steady growth of its tourism sector, Gaziantep has attracted investment in hotels,&#13;
restaurants, retail and other tourist infrastructure, as well as traditional artisanal craft workshops&#13;
producing copper, leather, and other products. Overall, there is â&#128;&#156;full employmentâ&#128;&#157;: despite the&#13;
massive influx of new residents, firms are mainly grappling with a shortage of workers.&#13;

International Trade&#13;
&#13;
Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic engine is largely export-driven: $6.2 billion was exported in 2013,&#13;
representing a tenfold increase from just $620 million in 2002. Gaziantep companies export to&#13;
164 destination countries, with a strong concentration on markets in the Middle East, particularly&#13;
Iraq and Syria161. In fact, Gaziantep alone accounted for a fifth of Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s total trade with Iraq,&#13;
which accounted for more than a third of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s total worldwide exports.&#13;
&#13;
The number of companies from Gaziantep in TÄ°M (Turkish Exportersâ&#128;&#153; Union) Top 1000&#13;
Exporters List increased by nearly one half between 2008 and 2012, to 71. There are a total of&#13;
1,270 companies with documented export sales, as well as 172 importing companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
161&#13;
    However, not all members of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s business community consider this to be as central or as permanent:&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Syria is not that important to Turkey economically. The middle classes have less to spend, and the industry is not&#13;
that developedâ&#128;¦ Northern Iraq is where the real money is for Gaziantep. â&#128;¦ Iraqi Kurdistan is industrializing&#13;
rapidly and they are buying our goods to do so. â&#128;¦ We are an industrial city now, so we primarily export to other&#13;
industrial       economies.â&#128;&#157;      â&#128;&#147;     academic      and      industrial     interviewees       in     Gaziantep&#13;

&amp;#12;Testing of Standardized Research Hypotheses&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the reportâ&#128;&#153;s Introduction, this is the fourth in a series of case studies of economically&#13;
successful cities around the world. In order to ensure comparability of â&#128;&#156;teachable momentsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
across all case studies, a set of standardized research hypotheses was tested in Gaziantep to&#13;
determine the exact scope for action at the metropolitan level, factors that may have most&#13;
affected how those prerogatives were used, and the extent to which specific interventions (and&#13;
how they were implemented) may have resulted in the economic outcomes observed.&#13;
&#13;
The first hypothesis tested seeks to determine to what extent Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic results were&#13;
attributable to proactively picking sectors to support, the second one looks at the strategic&#13;
planning process itself (if any) and how it may have affected economic growth, and the third one&#13;
looks at the planâ&#128;&#153;s implementation, if applicable.&#13;
&#13;
1. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic success is partly attributable to key local actors having made&#13;
   strategic bets on specific industrial initiatives, rather than just making improvements to its&#13;
   general investment climate in order to stimulate economic activity. National and local-level&#13;
   improvements to the business climate have facilitated the achievement of superior economic&#13;
   outcomes, but proactive initiatives on the part of public-private growth coalitions are likely to&#13;
   account for at least part of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s success.&#13;
&#13;
   Gaziantep has benefitted from an improving business climate at the national level, including&#13;
   greater openness to external trade and investment, free trade with the European Union and&#13;
   selected other trading partners, and improving connectivity (especially transport). At the&#13;
   local level, the municipal and provincial governments have focused on the provision of&#13;
   critical infrastructure like roads, natural gas, and water &amp; sewerage, reducing companiesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
   operating costs and improving residentsâ&#128;&#153; overall quality of life. The establishment and&#13;
   proliferation of Organized Industrial Zones (OIZs), in particular, has been a crucial enabler&#13;
   of local company growth across sectors and size bands.&#13;
&#13;
   In Gaziantep, proactive economic development initiatives have visibly contributed to the&#13;
   cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic success. They were undertaken by private-sector associations (especially&#13;
   chambers) in collaboration with city and provincial government, often utilizing national&#13;
   support tools and mechanisms. In the recent past, industry targeting has occurred on a largely&#13;
   ad-hoc basis, usually through the collaborative actions of the key local actors. There are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 201&#13;
&amp;#12;      various declarative documents pledging support for given industries, but no comprehensive&#13;
      formal strategy tying them into an integrated initiative.162&#13;
&#13;
      Ingredients of success:&#13;
&#13;
         a. As an economically successful city, Gaziantep has one dominant theme: the&#13;
            spectacular growth of its home-grown, largely family-owned manufacturing firms,&#13;
            through a process of organic cluster development. Predominantly located inside OIZs&#13;
            and overwhelmingly focused on exports, these manufacturers have accounted for the&#13;
            lionâ&#128;&#153;s share of employment growth over the past decade.&#13;
&#13;
         b. Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s proactive economic development efforts have been focused on helping&#13;
            the growth of industries producing tradable goods and services, including carpet&#13;
            manufacturing, textiles, food processing, chemicals, plastics &amp; packaging, and&#13;
            tourism.&#13;
&#13;
         c. In its proactive economic development activities, Gaziantep has not pursued an&#13;
            integrated, three-pronged approach to business development: nurturing the growth&#13;
            of existing firms, fostering the establishment of new start-up companies, and striving&#13;
            to attract new outside investment. The main focus of support efforts has been on&#13;
            existing local companies, who get assistance to locate in OIZs, expand production,&#13;
            upgrade and test technologies, and export.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. The likely trajectory of Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance was altered by specific policy&#13;
   interventions, such as the establishment of OIZs, but the city did and does not have a&#13;
   formal strategic plan for economic development. However, private-sector actors, or public-&#13;
   private coalitions of actors, have in practice carried out many actions typically found in&#13;
   such plans. Gaziantep has managed to outpace its national economy even without creating an&#13;
   official strategic plan for economic development, at least prior to 2010. Its principal private-&#13;
   sector actors (the Chambers of Industry and Commerce, associations, for-profit firms and&#13;
   high-profile individuals as champions) did not have a structured approach to economic&#13;
   development, but they did produce some internal strategy documents (e.g. on how to reach&#13;
   specific export targets). They largely followed their commercial instinct and experience in&#13;
   deciding on priorities, and engaged in a consultative process to set priorities.&#13;
&#13;
      Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic development-related activities have included:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
162&#13;
    Starting in 2010, however, the Silk Road Development Agency has been set up to support the economic&#13;
development of Gaziantep and two neighboring provinces through an integrated regional effort. Though this activity&#13;
falls outside the timeframe of this analysis, it can be expected to make a measurable difference in the coming years.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                202&#13;
&amp;#12;a. Some analytics to guide decision-making and tactics (less so strategy formulation), based&#13;
   on a knowledge of global business trends and first-hand experience doing business&#13;
   abroad. These were carried out at the level of the Chambers or individual firms, rather&#13;
   than for the city as a whole. However, they did result in de facto economic development&#13;
   marketing, recruitment, and assistance for business expansion and exports. No&#13;
   structured or formal planning process was employed to:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Identify key economic development issues facing Gaziantep, such as infrastructure&#13;
          deficiencies, relatively low levels of human capital and innovation, tough&#13;
          international competition for its manufacturersâ&#128;&#153; principal products, or turmoil in&#13;
          key export markets (Syria, Iraq). However, through regular meetings within and&#13;
          among local actors such as the City Council, Chambers of Commerce and Industry,&#13;
          associations, and other entities, the community did formulate ad-hoc agendas in&#13;
          response to the most pressing needs, and concrete steps to address them.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Identify the cityâ&#128;&#153;s main competitive strengths, such as its favorable geographic&#13;
          location, vast production capacity and know-how, well-developed trading links, a&#13;
          very engaged private sector, highly competitive business costs, and decent tourism&#13;
          development potential. However, consensus appears to already exist among most&#13;
          stakeholders about what the city has going for it â&#128;&#147; these are largely referred to as&#13;
          facts or articles of faith.&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Formulate a vision of progress that Gaziantep can make, including specific&#13;
          measures to address its challenges and to capitalize on its competitive strengths. A&#13;
          document entitled Competitiveness Agenda for the GAP Region was released by the&#13;
          Southeastern Anatolia Development Project (GAP) in 2007, and a Regional Plan&#13;
          2010-2013 prepared by the Silkroad Development Agency, but both of these were&#13;
          geographically broader than just Gaziantep Province. The Gaziantep Metropolitan&#13;
          Municipality also has a Strategic Plan 2010-2014, but its focus is on the provision&#13;
          of public services, thus much broader than just economic development, although&#13;
          some key economic indicators are also monitored and tracked.&#13;
&#13;
b. Gaziantep assembled a â&#128;&#156;growth coalitionâ&#128;&#157; at the metropolitan/provincial level,&#13;
   bringing together representatives of local government, businesses chambers, industry&#13;
   associations, universities, civil society groups (e.g. women, youth, the disabled) and other&#13;
   stakeholders in economic development. The institutional framework for the stakeholder&#13;
   engagement is provided by the City Council, with an influential but purely advisory role.&#13;
   The Councilâ&#128;&#153;s assembly has more than 300 members, only 20% of whom from&#13;
   government agencies, and the remaining 80% from the private sector or civil society at&#13;
   large. It has several thematic working groups issuing recommendations, some on&#13;
   economic development. There is a strong sense of common local identity and shared&#13;
   purpose among members of the business community in wanting to see their city advance&#13;
   economically, and come together in pursuit of such goals when needed, e.g. to lobby for&#13;
   improved transport infrastructure or the establishment of a new OIZ.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           203&#13;
&amp;#12;   c. Strategic decision-making and prioritization: Gaziantep has utilized a somewhat&#13;
      structured process for identifying and agreeing on policy priorities, primarily within the&#13;
      chambersâ&#128;&#153; sectoral working groups and City Councilâ&#128;&#153;s thematic working groups. No&#13;
      rigorous process for evaluating trade-offs between different public investment&#13;
      alternatives, such as cost-benefit analyses, has been observed at the local level.&#13;
      Administratively, Turkey is a highly centralized country, so local government is highly&#13;
      dependent on fiscal transfers from Ankara. The Chambers of Commerce and Industry&#13;
      advocate for specific forms of government support from the national government (e.g.&#13;
      airport expansion or a new highway), but this is not based on evaluating the relative&#13;
      merits of one form of support over another, mainly the outcome of discussions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. The level of autonomy related to economic development in Gaziantep (the equivalent of the&#13;
   â&#128;&#156;Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s Wedgeâ&#128;&#157;) was a factor in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s improved economic outcomes, particularly&#13;
   after decentralization measures in 2004. Local government bodies in Turkey (both&#13;
   municipal and provincial) are able to undertake limited interventions aimed at fostering&#13;
   economic growth, especially through the provision of critical public goods such as&#13;
   transport and water supply, land allocation, slum clearance and tourism â&#128;&#156;place-makingâ&#128;&#157;,&#13;
   and establishment of sister-city partnerships. The public sector has undertaken various&#13;
   proactive interventions â&#128;&#147; through plans, individual initiatives, and in practice â&#128;&#147; to spur&#13;
   economic development in Gaziantep.&#13;
&#13;
   a. There was no dedicated local economic development agency in Gaziantep, nor an&#13;
      economic development-related department of government, during most of the period&#13;
      covered by this case study. However, starting in 2010 with the establishment of the Silk&#13;
      Road Development Agency as a regional planning, coordination, and promotion body for&#13;
      three provinces including Gaziantep, a more structured approach has been adopted, and it&#13;
      can be said that Gaziantep now does have a dedicated economic development agency.&#13;
      This entity has not been in existence long enough for it to have materially affected&#13;
      Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s observed macroeconomic performance, but going forward it can be expected&#13;
      to play a more substantial facilitating role as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s (and Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s) economy strive to&#13;
      transition to higher income status and greater knowledge intensity.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢   Low financial and administrative autonomy: Although Turkey has&#13;
              implemented some decentralization reforms, it remains a highly centralized&#13;
              country with restricted administrative scope for local government..&#13;
          â&#128;¢   Funding: Municipalities in Turkey, including metropolitan municipalities in large&#13;
              urban areas, have low municipal spending ability and limited fiscal powers more&#13;
              generally. For example, Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality gets nearly three&#13;
              quarters of its budget through fiscal transfers from the national government.&#13;
          â&#128;¢   A well-defined geographical remit: Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s Metropolitan Municipality is the&#13;
              primary urban-tier local body in Gaziantep. However, it does not have functional&#13;
              authority beyond the city limits, e.g. in the OIZs. The Mayor is popularly elected&#13;
              to a five year term, while the provincial Governor is appointed from Ankara and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             204&#13;
&amp;#12;           heads      the     local      branches      of      all     national     agencies.&#13;
&#13;
b. Efficient internal management: The Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality, as well as&#13;
   the individual district municipalities, seem to perform very well in their core functional&#13;
   responsibilities.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Roles: The Metropolitan Municipality is primarily responsible for urban planning,&#13;
           transport, water supply, urban regeneration and redevelopment, business licenses&#13;
           and approvals, some aspects of land allocation, clearing out slums and upgrading&#13;
           public amenities like parks, and helping tourism development efforts. A range of&#13;
           other economic development functions, including entrepreneurial training, skills&#13;
           development, business advisory services, and export assistance are played by the&#13;
           local office of KOSGEB. Additional functions such as branding, government&#13;
           lobbying (on behalf of local firms and/or the city as a whole), business cluster&#13;
           development and entrepreneurial support, are carried out by the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
           chambers and industry associations.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Enabling environment: Local government in Gaziantep (both municipal and&#13;
           provincial) has worked to ensure the availability of critical infrastructure needed&#13;
           by local businesses (including OIZs), as well as to streamline administrative and&#13;
           bureaucratic procedures. Additionally, the OIZs have a more business-friendly,&#13;
           private-sector regime which makes things simpler and less onerous for firms.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Monitoring &amp; evaluation: The Silkroad Development Agencyâ&#128;&#153;s Regional Plan&#13;
           2010-2013 includes a vision, sets of goals, and individual thematic strategies for&#13;
           its three-province region, including Gaziantep. The plan provides for the tracking&#13;
           of a variety of indicators and sets some numerical targets both in terms of process&#13;
           and implementation, some of which are sector-specific. The planning process&#13;
           reveals a familiarity with global best practices in everything from benchmarking&#13;
           to stakeholder consultative workshops and techniques to ensure broader&#13;
           participation. There are some mechanisms for the thorough assessment of&#13;
           implementation against objectives, but this process is still in its formative years&#13;
           and it is too soon to draw any profound conclusions about its effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
c. Private sector and stakeholder involvement in implementation: Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s City&#13;
   Council provides a structured framework and forum for dialogue between public and&#13;
   private sector actors. Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality engages with stakeholders,&#13;
   who play a vital role in Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. Details:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s for-profit firms partner with government, but also pool financial and&#13;
           in-kind resources to help market and promote the city as a business and tourism&#13;
           destination.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Senior corporate leaders act as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s public champions and utilize their&#13;
           relationship capital to secure more investment and business opportunities for&#13;
           Gaziantep and its companies.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Gaziantepâ&#128;&#153;s private-sector firms are actively engaged in workforce development&#13;
           (ahi tradition), primarily through on-the-job training. However, skills and human&#13;
           capital levels remain below the national average for Turkey â&#128;&#147; yet apparently&#13;
           sufficient for existing industry needs. Challenges are likely to come up as the&#13;
                                                                                         205&#13;
&amp;#12;    cityâ&#128;&#153;s firms try to move into more knowledge-intensive, higher value-added&#13;
    industry segments and products.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Trade unions have not been observed play a prominent role in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
    development.&#13;
â&#128;¢   There is a permanent â&#128;&#156;growth coalitionâ&#128;&#157; of business and government leaders, as&#13;
    well as instances of stakeholders self-organizing on an ad-hoc basis in response to&#13;
    specific issues and opportunities.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The case study of the economic success of Changsha, China, is the fifth in the series of&#13;
World Bank case studies of successful metropolitan economies around the world. The&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive Cities Knowledge Base project aims to provide city leaders with the&#13;
tools and knowledge for the successful formulation and implementation of effective economic&#13;
development strategies at the city level. No single case study will provide a recipe for success for&#13;
other city leaders, but each case study in the series will offer insights and strategies for cities&#13;
with similar conditions, factors and challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Changsha was selected for this case study because between 2007 and 2012, Changsha&#13;
experienced exceptionally high rates of growth in GDP and employment, even for China.&#13;
As part of the city selection exercise, cities in the East Pacific region were ranked according to&#13;
the amount by which they exceeded the average national growth rate. Cities from China&#13;
dominated the rankings; with distinctions between Chinese cities difficult to make as growth in&#13;
terms of GDP and jobs sometimes differed by only one hundredth of a point. The decision was&#13;
made to select one representative Chinese city (not necessarily the best performing city as that&#13;
qualification would be hard to substantiate) for inclusion in the series of case studies.&#13;
&#13;
Many other cities in China had exceptional growth too; Changsha was selected as a&#13;
relevant city from which others could learn, not necessarily because it was unique. This&#13;
report in no way distinguishes Changsha as the top performing city in China during the period in&#13;
question. In fact, as the graph below shows, many other provincial capital cities in central and&#13;
western China also experienced tremendous growth in the same period. Changsha was selected&#13;
for its consistent high levels of growth, but also because of its relevance as a non-coastal, Tier 2&#13;
(secondary) city that lacks natural resources and strategic advantages (e.g. proximity to borders&#13;
or trade routes). Like the other cities graphed below, Changsha indeed benefitted from national&#13;
level policies, as well as its status as a provincial capital. However given that it lacked significant&#13;
inherited advantages and instead offered evidence of proactive strategies from which other cities&#13;
could learn, Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s success story was selected for further investigation.&#13;

Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s relevance derives in some ways from its drawbacks, which many other cities&#13;
around the world may also face. Specifically, Changsha is:&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Changsha is a mid-size (for China), secondary city that has grown its economy by&#13;
nurturing and diversifying its core industries, and systematically building human capital.&#13;
Changsha lacked the advantages of other Chinese cities in the coastal provinces, whose&#13;
promotion of higher value added manufacturing benefitted from strong transportation linkages&#13;
and external connectivity, as well as high levels of human capital. However Changsha has&#13;
managed to expand its manufacturing base, both attracting and fostering the growth of firms that&#13;
have become globally competitive. Outside manufacturing, the city is home to one of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
most dynamic media companies, albeit largely as a result of provincial actions. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
success is, of course, in part due to endowments and national and provincial factors. Yet the&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s own government has been an important catalyst for growth, effectively addressing&#13;
perennial problems such as inter-agency cooperation, government support for local businesses,&#13;
and improvements to human capital levels.&#13;
&#13;
Like other Chinese cities, Changsha has grown under unique conditions, which have both&#13;
created and eliminated problems for city leaders. Authority is highly decentralized in China&#13;
regarding local economic development and municipal government leaders are therefore&#13;
responsible for implementing strategies that will stimulate growth locally. Leaders have&#13;
historically had clear, prioritized GDP and tax revenue targets that were determined by the&#13;
central government; which have consequently simplified the problem of competing objectives.&#13;
Further, unlike other cities, the municipal government in China has rights over all or almost all&#13;
land in the city, which it can lease or use as collateral to fund local infrastructure. Cities are also&#13;
part of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s elaborate system of inter-governmental learning, which promotes piloting&#13;
reforms and adopting best practices. These unique conditions have given the municipal&#13;
government some unique degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they have created incentives&#13;
towards sprawling land use (biased against density), and fiscal dependency on land leases, which&#13;
may leave the city exposed during a property slump.&#13;
&#13;
National and provincial level policies and trends positively impacted the city. The national&#13;
government has pursued a policy entitled â&#128;&#156;The Rise of Central Chinaâ&#128;&#157; which promotes&#13;
investment in the region; as well as provides funding and key infrastructure investments, such as&#13;
the High Speed Rail (HSR), to improve connectivity. The national government has also&#13;
indirectly supported the growth of the construction machinery industry (the leading&#13;
manufacturing industry in Changsha). First, by installing a national research institute in&#13;
Changsha in the 1950s that generated knowledge in the area of construction machinery; and&#13;
second, by developing a national stimulus plan in 2009 (post global financial crisis) that&#13;
triggered a construction demand boom domestically. This demand drastically improved revenues&#13;
for construction machinery firms in Changsha from 2009-2012. Finally, as Hunanâ&#128;&#153;s capital,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  216&#13;
&amp;#12;Changsha was a beneficiary of provincial policies and initiatives; particularly the development of&#13;
Hunan TV, a dynamic media company that has provided significant jobs in the city.&#13;
&#13;
Above all, the municipal government strategically intervened to capitalize on these national&#13;
trends and location advantages. The municipal government made deliberate investments to&#13;
improve the cityâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness, prioritizing the growth of existing firms as well as the&#13;
attraction of new firms. The three most effective areas of intervention included:&#13;
&#13;
Nurturing the development of key industries by promoting the competitiveness of firms&#13;
&#13;
The municipal government actively supported the growth of key industries, and in particular, the&#13;
construction machinery industry. The most unique government initiatives were intended to&#13;
promote firms that could be globally competitive by providing market information to firms,&#13;
promoting sourcing from top global input suppliers in lieu of local procurement requirements,&#13;
and support for R&amp;D and attraction of top talent to the city. Through promoting individual firm&#13;
competitiveness, the government has consciously and unconsciously cultivated a fierce&#13;
competition between local firms. The construction machinery industry in Changsha has&#13;
accounted for over 100,000 direct jobs, generated worker training programs and contributed&#13;
significantly to municipal tax revenues and increased incomes that have improved welfare as&#13;
well as competitiveness163.&#13;
&#13;
Utilizing inter-agency coordination mechanisms to successfully diversify the economy&#13;
&#13;
To mitigate the risk of dependency on its core industry (construction machinery), the municipal&#13;
government diversified the economy by attracting new industries, like the automobile and&#13;
automobile parts industry. The government utilized effective inter-agency coordination&#13;
mechanisms, called â&#128;&#156;Leading Groupsâ&#128;&#157;, to coordinate investment attraction and investor aftercare&#13;
across various departments and levels of government. Many cities find investment attraction hard&#13;
to execute in practice, with investments frequently getting stuck due to government departments&#13;
working in silos. However the Leading Group helped the city to avoid these silos, by providing a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
163&#13;
    It should be noted that the rapid growth of this construction machinery industry during 2007-2012 was largely&#13;
dependent on the construction demand boom domestically because of the national stimulus plan post 2008 global&#13;
financial crisis. This leads to huge infrastructure investments in many cities across China which in turn creates a big&#13;
problem in municipal debt management. Since municipal debt management is not a unique problem faced by&#13;
Changsha only, and there are many reports that try to address this problem, this case study focuses on the local&#13;
economic development actors and address what these actors did well that contribute to the success of Changsha.&#13;
Particular attention was paid to initiatives that were uncommon and/or carried out in a unique manner that could be&#13;
of interest or assistance to other cities. This by no means indicates that other cities should clone exactly the same&#13;
industrial growth model.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  217&#13;
&amp;#12;framework with clear roles, reporting requirements and accountability mechanisms. At the same&#13;
time, the city was disciplined in letting go of industries that were not competitive, or competitive&#13;
only in the presence of permanent subsidies. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s successful diversification of the economy&#13;
has reduced the cityâ&#128;&#153;s exposure to the downturn of the construction machinery industry in 2012,&#13;
with new industries providing substantial, counterbalancing tax revenues.&#13;
&#13;
Developing and acquiring higher levels of human capital&#13;
&#13;
The city placed a high and sustained priority on human capital and developed a two pronged&#13;
approach in order to improve upon existing levels of human capital in the city. First, the city&#13;
sought to attract high level talent both domestically and abroad; leveraging national talent&#13;
attraction programs and initiating municipal programs of their own to effectively target, recruit&#13;
and compensate new talent willing to relocate to the city. Simultaneously, the city addressed&#13;
existing pools of talent through the regulation and promotion of vocational degree programs;&#13;
seeking to increase employment through the development of specialized â&#128;&#156;in-demandâ&#128;&#157; skillsets.&#13;
Both strategies have been successful, with vocational schools teaching applicable skills and&#13;
talent programs attracting thousands of high level â&#128;&#156;talentsâ&#128;&#157; to the city.&#13;
&#13;
In sum, Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s exceptional economic growth in 2007-2012 was a result of both&#13;
national and municipal level factors, but the latter predominated. National level factors&#13;
provided the city with significant potential, while actions by the municipal government leveraged&#13;
and furthered this potential. In the absence of the national factors several of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s actions&#13;
would have generated some, if lower levels of growth; while the national factors without the&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s actions would, at best, have left it anonymous, and at worst, synonymous â&#128;&#147; with Detroit.&#13;

&amp;#12;National Context&#13;
&#13;
National Framework&#13;
&#13;
Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s economic success occurred within a highly favorable national macro-&#13;
environment. In the last three decades China has achieved a growth record that may be a â&#128;&#156;once&#13;
in humanityâ&#128;&#157; event164). In terms of macroeconomics, the inflation rate was relatively well-&#13;
managed when compared to other emerging economies (see graph), the pegged exchange rate&#13;
regime provided exporters some degree of certainty in managing their export incomes, and the&#13;
domestic investment rate was consistently high, with an annual average of 40% of GDP over the&#13;
last 30 years. China has become the second largest economy in the world, and has successfully&#13;
lifted more than 500 million people out of poverty in the last 3 decades165. During the period of&#13;
2007-2012, Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP rose from $3.49 trillion USD to $8.23 trillion USD, with average&#13;
annual GDP growth around 10%166. The poverty headcount ratio at $1.25 a day was&#13;
approximately 6.3% in 2011, down from 12.3% in 2008167.&#13;

&amp;#12;regarding the promotion of economic growth to bring about economic reform; and as the Chinese&#13;
population becomes more urbanized, cities are responsible for promoting GDP growth and job&#13;
creation for increasing numbers of citizens. Municipal and provincial level leaders are ultimately&#13;
evaluated on the economic performance of their delegated region, with clear GDP targets that&#13;
hold them accountable for initiatives and reforms undertaken during their time in office. The&#13;
national government provides guidance in the form of national strategies that outline areas for&#13;
reform or increased attention (that can have funding attached); however it is the responsibility of&#13;
local leaders to carry out initiatives that fit under the umbrella of national policy. In doing so&#13;
local leaders have coped with a population influx unique in its scale: as of 2007, the number of&#13;
people living in urban areas in China was about 45%; just five years later, this number increased&#13;
to 52%170 (an increase of over 100 million people). Yet, approximately 130 Chinese cities&#13;
recorded annual GDP growth of over 10% during this same period (2007-2012)171.&#13;
&#13;
Chinese cities have operated with a unique degree of fiscal and political autonomy in their&#13;
objectives. The distinctive political environment in China has created both opportunities and&#13;
challenges for economic growth, and at the municipal level, this has resulted in a set of unique&#13;
conditions that differentiate Chinese cities from their counterparts. The national government has&#13;
both knowingly and unknowingly eliminated many of the governance challenges that cities&#13;
typically face. Several of the factors behind these unique conditions, like strict accountability to&#13;
GDP targets and the Communist Party of China - as opposed to constituents- have subsequently&#13;
created challenges of their own. This report in no way values the elimination of municipal&#13;
governance problems over all else, but simply seeks to highlight the unique scope conditions&#13;
relevant to Chinese cities. These common problems and how they are relaxed in Chinese cities&#13;
are illustrated in Table 1.&#13;

      Common Problems                                   Eliminated Problems&#13;
      Many cities struggle in terms of generating       Chinese cities own almost all of the land in&#13;
      revenue or capturing the value created by local   their jurisdiction and have influence over&#13;
      public goods                                      local bank branches to monetize and borrow&#13;
                                                        as needed&#13;
      Many cities struggle to address competing         Chinese cities have nationally mandated&#13;
      demands by constituents, while city leaders can   targets: maximize GDP (and economic&#13;
      be further burdened by competition between        growth) and avoid social unrest&#13;
      political parties&#13;
      City leaders can lack information about best      Chinese cities are part of an elaborate system&#13;
      practices regarding institutions and policies;    that fosters learning through think tanks,&#13;
      leaders are not necessarily in competition with   seminars &amp; conferences, networking,&#13;
      other cities                                      competition between cities, and rotating local&#13;
                                                        leaders to take up positions across the country&#13;
      The political party system can be contentious:    Chinese politics are heavily influenced by&#13;
      causing disconnect between administrations,       CPC party politics, and strong city leaders are&#13;
      additional incentive systems for city leaders     rewarded with promotions within the party&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Despite these, at times, favorable conditions for municipal leaders, it cannot be said that&#13;
Chinese cities are gifted with double-digit growth â&#128;&#156;by defaultâ&#128;&#157;. High-performing Chinese&#13;
cities have developed useful institutions and strategies that can offer valuable lessons to&#13;
others. Chinese cities have become highly adept at fostering conditions for growth, and despite&#13;
operating in a unique environment (as outlined above), the individual strategies and interventions&#13;
undertaken have relevance across borders. Chinese cities have become skilled at integrating best&#13;
practices and experimenting with reforms through piloting new policies and initiatives. As city&#13;
leadership in China is ultimately evaluated on economic performance, leaders have honed their&#13;
strategies, creating highly effective internal management structures and fostering the&#13;
development of globally competitive industries. How the cities have done this (not necessarily&#13;
why) can offer key insights to other cities looking to improve the effectiveness of their own&#13;
interventions.&#13;
&#13;
National Level Factors that Impacted Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s Growth&#13;
&#13;
Apart from the national framework provided to all cities, Changsha was specifically well-&#13;
positioned for growth in 2007-2012 due to several national policies and trends, including:&#13;
&#13;
   1. The national policy of the â&#128;&#156;Rise of Central Chinaâ&#128;&#157; and promotion of investment and&#13;
      economic growth in the central provinces&#13;
   2. External connectivity linkages through national infrastructure projects like the High&#13;
      Speed Rail (HSR)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          221&#13;
&amp;#12;   3. Inherited knowledge in the area of construction machinery (due to the placement of a&#13;
      national research institute in Changsha in the 1950s), which benefitted from a domestic&#13;
      construction boom following the 2009 national stimulus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 1: The national policy of the â&#128;&#156;Rise of Central Chinaâ&#128;&#157; in 2004 prioritized the growth&#13;
of cities and provinces in central China. This policy was similar to a greater emphasis on&#13;
western development and investment (i.e. â&#128;&#156;Go Westâ&#128;&#157; policy), in order to address rising income&#13;
inequality and an overreliance on the eastern coastal region for economic growth. Under the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Rise of Central Chinaâ&#128;&#157;, cities in central China have benefitted from transportation infrastructure&#13;
improvements and additional incentives for foreign investors in targeted sectors, both of which&#13;
were intended to highlight the regionâ&#128;&#153;s advantages, such as a centralized location, an unsaturated&#13;
market and abundance of cheap land and labor. Alongside the shift in Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s growth drivers&#13;
from exports to domestic demand, the large-scale investments in transport infrastructure for&#13;
goods helped to turn a locational disadvantage â&#128;&#147; being away from the coast â&#128;&#147; into an advantage,&#13;
with rapid transit times to multiple domestic markets.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 2: National transportation investments for the movement of people, like the High&#13;
Speed Rail (HSR), have improved connectivity between cities. The HSR is intended to&#13;
connect all provincial capital cities (i.e. Changsha); offering passengers drastically reduced&#13;
commuting times between cities throughout the vast country. This improved connectivity has&#13;
subsequently increased the accessibility of cities in central China that would otherwise suffer&#13;
from locational disadvantages. Changsha has specifically benefitted from its position at the&#13;
intersection of three high speed rail lines, which improve connectivity to major coastal cities like&#13;
Guangzhou (2 hours away) and Shanghai (5 hours away).The impact of this rail line is most&#13;
apparent in the presence of high levels of human capital, as people are more willing to relocate to&#13;
Changsha due to its improved connectivity to major cities, and even hometowns.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 3: Changsha inherited a national research institute in the 1950s that was focused on&#13;
generating knowledge in the construction machinery industry. This institute would facilitate&#13;
the emergence of Zoomlion, one of the top firms in the industry globally; as well as the&#13;
construction machinery cluster more largely, complete with input suppliers and competitor firms.&#13;
While the presence of the national research institute in no way guaranteed the success of future&#13;
firms (as will be discussed in the next section), its presence is acknowledged in order to&#13;
distinguish Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s inherited advantages from those of other Chinese cities.&#13;
&#13;
The construction machinery industry in Changsha would benefit further from decisions made at&#13;
the national level in 2009, when the national stimulus catalyzed a domestic construction demand&#13;
boom. This jump in domestic demand had a large impact on the industry, and top national firms&#13;
like Sany and Zoomlion (both located in Changsha) nearly doubled their sales and number of&#13;
employees as a result. This period of industry growth (2009-2012) directly coincided with the&#13;
                                                                                            222&#13;
&amp;#12;period of analysis of this case study series (2007-2012), thus explaining part of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
exceptional economic growth during this time. However, the demand was principally in&#13;
construction, which would not have automatically led to growth in Changsha were the city not&#13;
the home of firms already competitive in construction machinery.&#13;
&#13;
While unable to account for the entirety of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s success, these national government&#13;
factors were instrumental to Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s growth. The prioritization of the region by the&#13;
national government, the provision of infrastructure to address constraints to competitiveness&#13;
(i.e. location), and the establishment of an industry specific knowledge institute, (and subsequent&#13;
national stimulus package), all contributed to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness during the period of&#13;
analysis. In the end, however, none of these factors would independently trigger growth;&#13;
Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s success was largely dependent on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s ability to leverage each of these factors&#13;
and effectively collaborate at the municipal government level in order to promote the&#13;
development of several competitive industries.&#13;

&amp;#12;Local Context&#13;
&#13;
The City of Changsha:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     Scale: Home to over 7 million people&#13;
      and an area of 12,000 km2 (see&#13;
      image172), the City of Changsha is over&#13;
      3,000 years old, and today, is the capital&#13;
      city of Hunan Province. Changsha is&#13;
      made up of six districts, two counties&#13;
      and one county-level city. In the core of&#13;
      the city, the population is about 4.5&#13;
      million; with migrants making up about&#13;
      1/3 of the population (equivalent to 1.5&#13;
      million people). In 2012, Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      GDP reached 640 billion yuan (~ 102&#13;
      billion USD) up from 245 billion yuan (~32 billion USD) in 2007.&#13;
â&#128;¢     Governance: The city is governed by a Secretary General and Mayor, in addition to an&#13;
      Executive Vice Mayor and 7 Vice Mayors. The Mayor is appointed to 5 year term (and a&#13;
      maximum of 2 terms) by the local CPC committee(s). The CPC is responsible for&#13;
      establishing reporting hierarchies for the various tiers of government, and ultimately asserts&#13;
      control over the appointment as well as disciplining and dismissing of appointees.&#13;
â&#128;¢     Responsibility: The Municipal Government of Changsha is in charge of administering affairs&#13;
      within their jurisdiction and reports to the provincial government. There are approximately&#13;
      283 cities with municipal government authority in China (some cities in China have&#13;
      specialized authority due to designation as autonomous regions or centrally governed cities)&#13;
      and 31 of them are provincial capitals. It is the responsibility of the municipal government to&#13;
      provide almost all public services as well as economic planning for the city (including&#13;
      business development support; provision of infrastructure, water and electricity; provision of&#13;
      basic education, social welfare services and health services, etc.). The city of Changsha,&#13;
      specifically, manages twelve development zones and 39 municipal government departments,&#13;
      including the General Office, the Commission of Industry and Information Technology,&#13;
      Education Commission, Finance Bureau, and the Commerce Bureau.&#13;
â&#128;¢     Fiscal Resources: Taxation on business and profits from land leases account for a large part&#13;
      of local revenues. Most of the tax incomes, such as those from personal income and business&#13;
      income, are shared with higher tiers of government. Conversely, however, municipalities&#13;
      receive fiscal transfers from the central government for local government spending. Finally, a&#13;
      unique and important mechanism that Chinese cities have been using to finance public&#13;
      programs and infrastructure projects is through setting up a special purpose vehicle company&#13;

&amp;#12;      to borrow credit against future land values. With these potential local fiscal resources in&#13;
      mind, in 2012, Changsha achieved a balanced budget, with a small surplus173. This enables&#13;
      Changsha (financially) to invest in pro-business initiatives that promote firm growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hunan Province:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     Scale: Changsha is the capital of Hunan province; a province of over 200,000 km2 and 72&#13;
      million people174. Located in central China, Hunan province is made up of 13 cities and 1&#13;
      autonomous prefecture. The provincial GDP reached 2.2 trillion yuan175 in 2012 (350 billion&#13;
      USD), up from 1.3 billion yuan in 2009176. Apart from being known as a historical rice and&#13;
      cotton producer, a growing industrial base, and the home of the popular television network&#13;
      Hunan TV, Hunan is also the birthplace of several national leaders, including Zeng Guofan&#13;
      and Chairman Mao Zedong.&#13;
â&#128;¢     Governance: The province is governed by a Secretary General, a Governor, an Executive&#13;
      Vice Governor, 5 Vice Governors, and an Assistant Vice Governor. Similar to appointments&#13;
      at the city level, Governors are appointed by the local CPC committee(s). The Secretary&#13;
      General is first in command, leading the provincial committee that governs the Province. The&#13;
      Governor follows the Secretary General as second in command. There are 23 provinces in&#13;
      the country, all of which report to the State Council (the institutional body that delineates&#13;
      responsibility between the central government and provincial government).&#13;
â&#128;¢     Responsibility: The responsibilities at the provincial level include administering economic,&#13;
      social and cultural affairs within the province. The provincial government can also&#13;
      implement local laws and decisions made by the provincial peopleâ&#128;&#153;s congress and CPC&#13;
      standing committee. The division of responsibilities among the province and municipal&#13;
      government is not always clear-cut, with mandates frequently overlapping. Such overlaps&#13;
      and blurred responsibilities were not considered a cause for concern, possibly because&#13;
      Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s governance framework places greater weight on whole-of-government outcomes&#13;
      (growth, employment and social stability) than on differentiated functional processes.&#13;
â&#128;¢     Fiscal Resources: China is a very centralized country in terms of fiscal resources. For&#13;
      example, 75% of the business income taxes that are collected locally have to be sent back to&#13;
      the central government, while local governments (including province, city, county, town, and&#13;
      village governments) share the remaining 25%. In the case of the city of Changsha and&#13;
      Hunan province, Hunan province has the authority to decide the tax sharing mechanism with&#13;
      Changsha (such as what percentage of the local taxes Changsha retains). Since Changsha has&#13;
      a bigger tax base, it typically has more fiscal income than other cities in the province.&#13;

&amp;#12;While the key focus of this case study was analyzing strategies and initiatives undertaken&#13;
by city level agencies, it is imperative to note that several interventions undertaken at the&#13;
provincial level also had a large impact on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s success. Like all cities, Changsha does&#13;
not operate in a vacuum; both national and provincial level policies and initiatives contributed to&#13;
the high levels of GDP and job growth in the city. For instance:&#13;
&#13;
The Cultural Industry: Alongside construction machinery, Changsha is also home to a thriving&#13;
cultural industry. Primarily dependent on Hunan TV (a television station), the industry employs&#13;
about 20,000 people in the province and 10,000 in the city of Changsha. Hunan TV is a&#13;
provincial SOE, and like Zoomlion, was granted significant autonomy that made its success&#13;
ultimately dependent on 2-3 top, effective managers. Similar to other firms in Changsha, Hunan&#13;
TV credits its success to a strong talent attraction program, effective managers, and a flexible&#13;
structure that promotes competitiveness as well as the belief that state owned assets should&#13;
maintain their value (and be regularly evaluated).This industry was not featured in this case&#13;
study because, despite Hunan TVâ&#128;&#153;s success (3rd largest station nationally after National CCTV&#13;
and Shanghai TV, and highest viewing ratio), the SOE has largely received support from the&#13;
provincial government, with very little support from the municipal government. However, its&#13;
popularity generally helps Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s image and reportedly makes it more attractive for talent.&#13;
&#13;
Improved Access to Finance: The Chinese central government has made significant efforts to&#13;
promote access to finance for businesses. As the Chinese banking and finance sectors are both&#13;
regulated by central government agencies, it was under their authority that special purpose policy&#13;
banks and insurance companies designed to promote exports were established. The provinces,&#13;
however, had to attract banks and insurance companies to open branches within their&#13;
jurisdiction. In Hunanâ&#128;&#153;s case, the provincial government facilitated the opening of a branch of&#13;
the Export-Import Bank of China (a non-profit financial institution) in 2006. Access to this&#13;
branch subsequently improved access to finance for numerous businesses, most especially, the&#13;
construction machinery firms. Given the high cost of heavy machinery, buyers frequently&#13;
required loans to make purchases. When foreign buyers were unable to get favorable loans from&#13;
their home countries, they were instead able to get low interest rate loans from the Export-Import&#13;
Bank. This helped the construction machinery industry to increase sales worldwide, increasing&#13;
their exports and reducing their dependence on domestic sales (prior to the domestic slowdown).&#13;
&#13;
Both the success of the cultural industry and the presence of the Export-Import Bank promoted&#13;
the economic success of the city. Both were driven by the province, though in other countries&#13;
such initiatives may be possible for cities (the â&#128;&#156;mayorâ&#128;&#153;s wedgeâ&#128;&#157; having a different scope in each&#13;
country). However provincial government support did not end there; there were numerous&#13;
occasions in which the provincial government made itself available to support the initiatives of&#13;
the municipal government. Examples of such support are noted in the Factors section below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               226&#13;
&amp;#12;The Private Sector and External Stakeholders:&#13;
&#13;
The private sector in Changsha was not actively engaged in the formation or implementation of&#13;
economic development strategies. The private sector was responsible for starting up key leading&#13;
firms in the city, like Sany, a leading firm in the construction machinery industry. The private&#13;
sector also collaborated through the Changsha Enterprise Association for Foreign Investment, a&#13;
600 member nonprofit organization that advocates for policies that support private sector&#13;
interests and serves as a representative of private sector interests to the local government177.&#13;
While the Association has served the interests of its members, its role has been more limited to&#13;
lobbying and advocacy efforts regarding specific city regulations (e.g. traffic regulation).&#13;
&#13;
Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Factors of Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s municipal government was the main catalyst in initiatives that took advantage&#13;
of exogenous and inherited opportunities. The municipal government made deliberate public&#13;
investments to improve the competitiveness of local industries and transition (and diversify) the&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic base by attracting new industries and high level talent. The most effective&#13;
initiatives (promoting growth) have been grouped into three categories of intervention:&#13;
&#13;
      1. Nurturing the development of key industries by promoting the competitiveness of firms&#13;
      2. Utilizing inter-agency coordination mechanisms to successfully diversify the economy&#13;
      3. Developing and acquiring higher levels of human capital through vocational degree&#13;
         programs and talent attraction programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 1: Nurturing the development of key industries by promoting the competitiveness (and&#13;
competition) of local firms&#13;
&#13;
Since the late 1990s, the municipal government in Changsha has actively supported the growth&#13;
of the construction machinery industry, both consciously and unconsciously facilitating a fierce&#13;
competition among the leading firms. Initiatives undertaken by the government to support this&#13;
industry were centered on the premise of building globally competitive firms; the most notable&#13;
initiatives included: providing support in the form of access to market information and linkages&#13;
to top global suppliers, and support for R&amp;D and attraction of top talent across all firms in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
177&#13;
  It must be acknowledged that the Association was initially supported and funded by the government. Today, the&#13;
Association is formally independent from the government.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            227&#13;
&amp;#12;industry. Furthermore, the city took steps to support firms, without disproportionately promoting&#13;
the growth of specific firms over others (even when some of the firms were SOEs).&#13;
&#13;
What Did the Industry Look Like?&#13;
&#13;
Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s successful industrial sector developed from homegrown, local firms. After&#13;
market reforms in the late 1970s, Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s growth began to pale in comparison to that of&#13;
coastal cities in China. Located in a province that relied chiefly on agricultural production,&#13;
Changsha had become a center for trading, manufacturing and services (with primary, secondary,&#13;
and tertiary industries contributing 12.96%, 42.93% and 44.11% to GDP respectively178 in&#13;
1998). It was not until the early 2000s that Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing sector began to take off;&#13;
with significant growth in industrial output initiated by homegrown firms, like Sany and&#13;
Zoomlion, not by foreign investment or newly attracted industries (favored pathways to growth&#13;
in many other cities).&#13;
&#13;
The construction machinery industry was not an early priority for the government. In fact,&#13;
leading firms started up independently of significant public sector support. Both Sany and&#13;
Zoomlion developed without government intervention or preferential policies. Despite Zoomlion&#13;
being an SOE, the firm received minimal assistance during its startup; receiving a loan of only .5&#13;
million RMB, of which half had to be deposited as collateral. Even early support, like land&#13;
within industrial parks, was offered to other firms outside of the construction machinery industry&#13;
as well. The government did not select individual firms or industries as local champions, but&#13;
allowed firms to demonstrate capability to compete before receiving more tailored support.&#13;
&#13;
The two leading firms, Sany and Zoomlion have developed a fierce competition that has&#13;
encouraged increases in innovation and productivity. While both firms developed in&#13;
Changsha in the 1990s, they have had different trajectories and different ownership structures&#13;
that have markedly set them apart. For instance:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢      Sany is a private sector firm, currently ranked #1 nationally and #6 globally in the&#13;
       construction machinery industry. Established in 1989 by 4 engineers in Hunan Province,&#13;
       Sany relocated to Changsha in 1994 to take advantage of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s resources. During the&#13;
       peak of the construction demand boom in 2011, Sany enjoyed 60% annual growth,&#13;
       contributed 40% of district tax revenue, and accounted for about 5% of city GDP. Annual&#13;
       operating income (i.e. profit) reached 2.6 billion RMB (~430 million USD) in 2009 and 6.9&#13;
       billion RMB (~1.1 billion USD) in 2012, almost tripling in 3 years. As of 2014, Sany&#13;
       employed about 13,000 people in Changsha and 18,000 within Hunan Province. In the face&#13;

&amp;#12;      of the current slowdown, the company is focusing on the provision of value-added services&#13;
      alongside its machinery.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     Zoomlion is a SOE, ranked #7 globally in the construction machinery industry. Zoomlion has&#13;
      direct roots in the Construction and Machinery Research Institute (the aforementioned&#13;
      National Research Institute). In 1992, the Vice President of the Institute wanted to start a&#13;
      company using the knowledge generated from research, although at the time, he was not sure&#13;
      in what area specifically the company should focus. He went on to found Zoomlion and&#13;
      became the SOEâ&#128;&#153;s first President. In the late 1990s, Zoomlion was listed on the Shenzhen&#13;
      stock exchange, and today, the firm has diverse shareholders using a limited liability&#13;
      corporation structure, with only a 16% provincial government stake. Annual operating&#13;
      income was approximately 2.8bn RMB (~460 million USD) in 2009 and 8.9 bn RMB (~1.4&#13;
      billion USD) in 2012. As of 2014, Zoomlion employs nearly 20,000 people in the city. In the&#13;
      face of the current slowdown, the company has adopted a different strategy than Sany,&#13;
      diversifying into machinery for non-construction sectors. In particular, it has invested heavily&#13;
      in agricultural equipment, betting that rural land reforms will spark widespread&#13;
      mechanization in China.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other construction machinery firms in Changsha include Sunward, CHTC Jove, Rullong Heavy&#13;
Industries, Zhongli Machinery, Dingli Tech, and AVIC Landing Gear179. Sunward is the most&#13;
prominent and is rapidly moving into global markets, e.g., for advanced tunneling equipment. It&#13;
is sometimes grouped with Sany and Zoomlion as â&#128;&#156;the three musketeersâ&#128;&#157;. The combined number&#13;
of jobs in Changsha from all firms in the construction machinery industry (including Sany and&#13;
Zoomlion) is estimated at 100,000.180&#13;
&#13;
What Did Support for the Industry Look Like?&#13;
&#13;
Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s dominance in construction machinery was not automatic. Other Chinese cities&#13;
tried to nurture the same industry, sometimes with more substantial, if superficial,&#13;
advantages. In the early 1990s, Changsha was one of many cities in China with the potential to&#13;
develop a construction machinery cluster, but the city differentiated itself by not imposing a local&#13;
procurement requirement, and providing support in the form of the provision of market&#13;
information instead. Other Chinese cities had firms in the construction machinery industry; for&#13;

tax credits for providing in house training; as long as this training had been government certified&#13;
(e.g., Sany Technical School is one of only 9 city government-certified vocational degree&#13;
programs in the city). Tax credits and matching of funding were also available to firms to&#13;
support R&amp;D, new investments or international acquisitions.&#13;
&#13;
In recent years (2005-present), the municipal government has supported the transition into&#13;
higher value added production. Support has included help accessing national and provincial&#13;
level programs to tap into funds intended for R&amp;D projects and high level talent attraction. For&#13;
instance, both Sany and Zoomlion attracted high level talent by utilizing national talent attraction&#13;
programs that provided funding (i.e. research grants, compensation and/or settlement&#13;
allowances) for top talent willing to relocate internationally or nationally. The provincial&#13;
government also invested in a design center, made accessible to all firms, to encourage&#13;
innovation across the industry. The center has been particularly active in helping connect Sany&#13;
to international designers, and to enable its own cultural connection with acquired companies in&#13;
the West (e.g., Italy).&#13;

countries and has 30 subsidiaries worldwide; Zoomlion is similarly expanding overseas and in&#13;
2012 had a 27% jump in overseas sales (just as domestic demand was in decline) .&#13;
&#13;
What Was the Impact of the Industry on the City?&#13;
&#13;
The construction machinery industry had a significant economic impact on the city,&#13;
providing critical tax revenues, technical training for worker development, jobs and&#13;
increased incomes. The industry reached 194.7 billion yuan in industrial output in 2012182 (a&#13;
6.6% increase from 2011) and accounted for 24% of the Cityâ&#128;&#153;s total industrial output value in&#13;
2011. In terms of employment, the top two firms alone (Sany and Zoomlion) employ over 30,000&#13;
people in Changsha, smaller firms like AVIC Landing Gear employ about 3,000183, and most&#13;
total industry employment estimates are around 100,000. Taking into account the industry&#13;
multiplier of 5184, and assuming a 2.25 million size labor force (50% labor participation rate of a&#13;
4.5 million population size core city), employment from this industry cluster represents over&#13;
20% of total Changsha job opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
181&#13;
    Many economists have expressed concerns about other types of support, including the high levels of debt and&#13;
cuts in interest rates to support large SOEs. This report did not focus on such issues and therefore cannot confirm or&#13;
deny any such issues in Changsha. The primary focus of this report was what the City did well.&#13;

&amp;#12;Factor 2: Utilizing inter-agency coordination mechanisms to improve investment attraction&#13;
&#13;
The government of Changsha successfully diversified the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic base by attracting new&#13;
industries, like the automobile industry. The city used effective interagency coordination&#13;
mechanisms, called â&#128;&#156;Leading Groupsâ&#128;&#157; to coordinate investment attraction efforts across&#13;
departments and industrial parks management structures. This diversification ultimately reduced&#13;
the cityâ&#128;&#153;s exposure to the construction downturn and helped Changsha to avoid the fate of other&#13;
largely one industry dependent cities (e.g., Detroit).&#13;
&#13;
What Did Investment Attraction Look Like?&#13;
&#13;
The municipal government prioritized the attraction of new industries in order to reduce&#13;
the cityâ&#128;&#153;s dependence on the construction machinery industry for jobs and tax revenue.&#13;
The city quickly set its sights on the automobile industry as it offered a large number of jobs for&#13;
lower skilled workers, and despite the cityâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to improve levels of human capital, there&#13;
were still numerous lower skilled workers seeking employment in the city.&#13;
&#13;
The city had a number of factors in their favor for attracting the automobile industry:&#13;
&#13;
1. The automobile industry was a nationally prioritized sector, so proactively targeting this&#13;
   industry was in line with the interests of provincial and national level officials (The city did&#13;
   not target all nationally prioritized sectors, the municipal government only targeted those for&#13;
   which they felt they had capacity; for instance, they dismissed the textile industry).&#13;
2. Changsha was cost competitive in terms of logistics, labor and land (due to municipal&#13;
   improvements atop inherited advantages)&#13;
3. There was significant market demand; Changsha boasts high per capita income levels and&#13;
   high rates of consumer spending, while the central region of China more largely has a&#13;
   relatively unsaturated market and high levels of growth predicted in the next ten years.&#13;
4. There was some existing capacity for supply, albeit small and of doubtful competitiveness;&#13;
   including a few automobile parts factories and spillovers from skills developed for workers&#13;
   in the electronics industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These factors were understood intuitively and via market-testing rather than through&#13;
extensive desk analysis. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s strategy for automobile manufacturing was based on some&#13;
analysis, albeit of uncertain robustness and with extremely aggressive targets. Moreover, the&#13;
strategy for other industries has been somewhat less successful, for example, the cityâ&#128;&#153;s selection&#13;
of the electronics industry. Although a single electronics firm has created a large number of jobs&#13;
producing screens for the iPhone, there has not been the growth of a cluster of firms such as in&#13;
the automobile industry. In fact, a large MNC left when its tax benefits expired (see text box). It&#13;
is debatable whether this should be seen as a blemish, since this meant, in practice, applying a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               232&#13;
&amp;#12;market test rather than a consultant test. Such tests however may only be feasible at a smaller&#13;
scale for cities with greater constraints on fiscal action.&#13;
&#13;
Firms like Fiat and Sumitomo were attracted to Changsha, citing cost competitiveness,&#13;
capacity and market opportunities as key reasons behind their decisions to invest. However&#13;
firms were further attracted by incentives offered; such as preferential tax policies, availability of&#13;
funding (e.g. tax credits for high-tech R&amp;D activities), and locational advantages in industrial&#13;
parks where input suppliers could be co-located with&#13;
                                                            Letting Key Firms in the Electronics&#13;

offices could more easily address labor supply needs&#13;
(conducting regular recruitment events). While                It is important to note that not all&#13;
numerous parks exist in China offering similar                 attraction efforts were met with&#13;
preferential treatment, the firms interviewed                success. In the electronics industry,&#13;
highlighted     the    attentiveness     and   attraction      LG was attracted but left when&#13;
coordination by the municipal government as one of            nearby city Wuhan offered more&#13;
the key factors in their decision to invest.                 attractive incentives. Changsha did&#13;
                                                               not try to compete with Wuhan or&#13;
The automobile industryâ&#128;&#153;s entrance was well-timed;&#13;
                                                             initiate a race to the bottom. Instead,&#13;
just as the downturn in the construction machinery&#13;
                                                                the government maintained that&#13;

individual industry cycles.&#13;
&#13;
How Did the Government Successfully Manage Investment Attraction?&#13;
&#13;
The municipal government utilized Leading Groups to effectively coordinate investment&#13;
attraction efforts and investor aftercare. Leading Groups are temporary committees that are&#13;
convened for a specific initiative (like investment attraction) in order to both coordinate among&#13;
various departments as well as keep top level officials informed of progress and/or problems.&#13;
Leading Groups were in no way unique to Changsha, but are a common mechanism used across&#13;
China by government officials. It should also be noted that not all leading groups are successful.&#13;
Those that are set up for an initiative falling into the cityâ&#128;&#153;s prioritized area and are overseen by&#13;
the mayor himself tend to be more effective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  233&#13;
&amp;#12;Leading Groups coordinated not only different departments but different levels of&#13;
government, including municipal departments and industrial park management:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢      Municipal Government Level: All municipal employees have a shared objective of&#13;
       achieving GDP growth targets, for which city leaders are ultimately assessed on achieving.&#13;
       Departments are individually evaluated on specific initiatives that contribute to GDP growth&#13;
       and tax revenues (which provide further funding for initiatives designed to promote growth).&#13;
       However, like many other cities, individual departments can suffer from working in silos,&#13;
       and can have difficulties cooperating on inter-agency matters. The personnel evaluation&#13;
       system tracks, to some extent, responsiveness to othersâ&#128;&#153; problems. However on its own, the&#13;
       municipal governance structure had no incentive system or coordination mechanism (before&#13;
       Leading Groups) to address these issues.&#13;
â&#128;¢      Industrial Parks: All of the parks in the city have independent management structures&#13;
       called â&#128;&#156;organizing committeesâ&#128;&#157;. Each declared park is over 100 km2 (although zones are&#13;
       built incrementally in phases of 10-15 km2), and contains factories, roads residential, retail,&#13;
       and even schools and hospitals. Formally the organizing committee is considered an&#13;
       independent government, ranked a half-level up from the county level. The organizing&#13;
       committees are large enough to address many of their own problems internally, and small&#13;
       enough that internal coordination between departments is relatively easy. The parks are&#13;
       funded by land sales, leases and service fees, with net surpluses contributed back to the&#13;
       municipal budget. Historically, the parks were held to individual targets that promoted&#13;
       quantity (number of firms and jobs) over quality. However, of late, this has been changing;&#13;
       clear directives (and correspondingly lower targets) have been given to parks, like the&#13;
       Changsha High-Tech Industrial Development Zone, to prioritize quality185 over quantity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The â&#128;&#156;Leading Group for an open economyâ&#128;&#157; works to promote high-quality investment&#13;
attraction effectively across municipal departments and park organizing committees;&#13;
creating a framework that clearly establishes roles, reporting requirements and&#13;
accountability. This specific Leading Group is headed by the Mayor and supported by a&#13;
dedicated office that draws on personnel and resources from the Bureau of Commerce. There are&#13;
approximately 30 departments (across the municipal, county and park government structures)&#13;
that are formal members of the Leading Group, their respective roles delineated in a concise 4-5&#13;
page document. The Leading Group draws on the management structure of each individual party,&#13;
ensuring that problems move efficiently up existing channels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
185&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;Qualityâ&#128;&#157; refers to promotion of start-ups, and high tech R&amp;D and higher value added production by firms.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  234&#13;
&amp;#12;Reporting requirements for members of the Leading Group ensured that investor&#13;
problems are dealt with in a timely fashion (see graphic on next page). Departments can&#13;
voluntarily bring up problems, but the Leading Group mechanism is intended to catch problems&#13;
routinely, through reporting:&#13;
&#13;
1. Each week, designated officers within parks call their assigned investor to check if any&#13;
   problems or concerns have emerged. Problems can be addressed immediately within the park&#13;
   management structure (if possible). Only unsolved problems are listed in the monthly report.&#13;
2. Each month, the municipal departments, park organizing committees and county&#13;
   governments submit a monthly report to the Leading Group office on progress and problems&#13;
   with investments in their jurisdiction. If reports indicate a problem or delay, then the Leading&#13;
   Group office will address this problem with the reporting party immediately. If the problem&#13;
   persists, then it will be brought up at the quarterly meeting of the Leading Group (see #4).&#13;
3. Each quarter, within parks, directors and senior management meet with all investors to&#13;
   address issues and discuss prospective problems. Problems that cannot be resolved are taken&#13;
   to the Leading Group quarterly meeting (see #4).&#13;
4. Each quarter, the Vice-Mayor chairs a meeting for â&#128;&#156;coreâ&#128;&#157; members of the Leading Group.&#13;
   Only problems and changes in policy are addressed at this meeting, indicative of the trend to&#13;
   raise problems (not approvals) to high-level officialsâ&#128;&#153; attention.&#13;
5. If problem is still not adequately addressed, then the Leading Group office brings the matter&#13;
   to the Mayor, who calls a subset of the Leading Group (of concerned departments) to solve&#13;
   the problem. Additionally, problems can be set aside for the semi-annual plenary sessions of&#13;
   the Leading Group, held for particularly intractable problems (and shifts in policy).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               235&#13;
&amp;#12;Finally, measures to improve accountability at the individual and department level were&#13;
incorporated into the framework. All personnel are required to handle problems that are&#13;
brought to their attention or they must be officially handed off to another department. Even if the&#13;
request is brought to a department that is not the best suited to assist, that department is required&#13;
to handle or â&#128;&#156;hand-offâ&#128;&#157; the request to the appropriate department. While focal points exist for&#13;
each investor, no focal point is designated as the sole point of contact, ensuring that the investor&#13;
may contact any department or personnel that they desire. A response of â&#128;&#156;not my mandateâ&#128;&#157; is&#13;
considered unacceptable, and to monitor this, it is required that requests brought to specific&#13;
individuals are tracked in personnel files (and firm concerns are likely to resurfaceâ&#128;¦).&#13;
&#13;
Further, performance evaluations are conducted at all levels. The municipal departments and&#13;
parks each have annual performance evaluations that measure industrial output and annual&#13;
revenue (industrial parks) and contributions to GDP and tax revenue (municipal departments).&#13;
But at a more detailed level, these evaluations incorporate organizational responsiveness and&#13;
contributions to prioritized initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
What Was the Impact of the Leading Group?&#13;
&#13;
While the Leading Group for an open economy is not necessarily unique to Changsha or&#13;
even the time period in question, it undoubtedly helped the city to attract new industries.&#13;
As a result of coordination mechanisms and efforts to improve investment attraction and investor&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 236&#13;
&amp;#12;aftercare, the city attracted new firms in emerging industries, like automobiles, electronics and&#13;
biomedicine. These new industries contributed to economic growth and diversification,&#13;
increasing tax revenues and resilience to industry specific downturns.&#13;
&#13;
Industrial Output by Industry (2012)186&#13;
&#13;
         Construction Machinery Industry              194.7 billion yuan (30.96 billion USD)&#13;
&#13;
         Automobiles and Parts                        31.1 billion yuan (4.95 billion USD)&#13;
&#13;
         Cultural and Creative Industry               125 billion yuan (19.88 billion USD)&#13;
&#13;
         New Materials187                             123.9 billion yuan (19.7 billion USD)&#13;
&#13;
         Biomedical                                   19.8 billion yuan (3.15 billion USD)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specifically, the automobile industry supported resilience after the downturn of the&#13;
construction machinery industry. In 2008, industrial output in the automobile industry was&#13;
only 14.7 billion RMB188, but by 2012, industrial output had more than doubled to 31.1 billion&#13;
RMB (an increase alone of 26.6% from 2011189). Firms working in the automobile industry&#13;
include Bosch, Lizhong Automobile Design, Sumitomo Rubber, Hitachi, BYD, GAC Fiat,&#13;
etc.190. At present, a new Volkswagen plant is under construction that will increase the&#13;
production capacity in the city by 300,000 cars in 2016191.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 3: Developing and acquiring higher levels of human capital&#13;
&#13;
The municipal government of Changsha placed a high and sustained priority on human capital;&#13;
seeking to ultimately increase incomes and GDP growth through higher levels of human capital.&#13;
Higher levels of human capital in Changsha contributed to improvements in productivity and&#13;
innovation at existing firms, attraction of higher value added sectors and the growth of new firms&#13;

                                                                                                                237&#13;
&amp;#12;in emerging industries. Senior officials all listed investment in human capital as their first&#13;
priority, well above physical infrastructure. However, building human capital is much easier&#13;
said than done, and beset with market and institutional failures. Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s strategies for&#13;
improving levels of human capital in the city have been centered on two approaches: talent&#13;
attraction and vocational training.&#13;
&#13;
What Challenges and Advantages did Changsha Inherit regarding Human Capital?&#13;
&#13;
Although home to numerous universities, Changsha did not inherit any significant&#13;
advantage in terms of an abundance of high level human capital. In fact, brain drains were&#13;
common to the central and western regions of China, with top level talent migrating both&#13;
domestically and internationally. Nationally, large Tier 1 cities in the eastern (or coastal)&#13;
provinces, like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen attracted top talent with their highly&#13;
ranked university degrees, and/or more attractive incomes and lifestyles.&#13;
&#13;
What did Talent Attraction Programs Look Like?&#13;
&#13;
Changsha has leveraged national and provincial level programs as well as developed&#13;
municipal programs to attract highly talented individuals both domestically and abroad. In&#13;
order to improve levels of human capital within the city, the municipal government sought to&#13;
attract new talent. Similar to efforts to promote new investment, the city utilized the Leading&#13;
Group mechanism (called the Leading Group for Talent Attraction) to coordinate tasks, such as:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   the identification of existing firms, areas of research and emerging industries in which new&#13;
    talent was needed;&#13;
â&#128;¢   the leveraging of national level programs and funding; and&#13;
â&#128;¢   the implementation of recruitment efforts both domestically and overseas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At the national level, Changsha made aggressive use of national programs designed to&#13;
recruit high level research talents. For instance, the 1,000 Talent Attraction program, which&#13;
started in 2009, accepts applications from candidates who have resettled in China and are willing&#13;
to stay for up to 3 years. The National Central Organizing Committee evaluates applicants&#13;
against specific criteria and provides compensation for approved â&#128;&#156;talentâ&#128;&#157; as compensation and/or&#13;
a resettlement allowance. The municipal government used this program- and compensation&#13;
package- both to market the city to individuals (to encourage them to resettle in Changsha) and&#13;
for utilization by its top firms, like Sany and Zoomlion, who recruited high level talents with the&#13;
knowledge that funding could be individually applied for through the national program. Both&#13;
Sany and Zoomlion reported that several of their most important senior researchers in their&#13;
expanding R&amp;D centers were attracted through the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               238&#13;
&amp;#12;At the municipal level, the city independently attracted talent by developing municipal&#13;
attraction programs. Municipal Program 313, for example, which began in 2009, was&#13;
implemented by the Talent Attraction Leading Group. The program utilized diaspora networks&#13;
overseas to promote and attract new applicants to the program, as those with stronger&#13;
connections to the city could be more easily convinced to resettle or stay in Changsha. Diaspora&#13;
networks were also used as a low-cost marketing and outreach tool, helping to advertise and&#13;
identify individuals in targeted industries that could be recruited. The program enjoyed such&#13;
success that the Leading Group has plans to develop a follow on attraction program.&#13;
&#13;
What did Vocational Training Look Like?&#13;
&#13;
The municipal government in Changsha certified and provided funding to eligible&#13;
vocational schools. Higher vocational degree programs are degrees available to high school&#13;
graduates that complete 3-4 years of vocational training at specialized schools. These programs&#13;
are ubiquitous in China; intended to address unemployment and increasing demands for skilled&#13;
labor in specialized fields. However, unlike other cities, Changsha has managed to address many&#13;
typical market failures in vocational education, with firms reporting high levels of satisfaction&#13;
with local schools and the availability of skilled labor. The city achieved these outcomes by:&#13;
imposing high barriers to entry, stimulating competition through transparent performance&#13;
reporting, providing funding, and improving linkages with firms.&#13;
&#13;
The city imposed high barriers to entry for vocational degree programs,192 improving the&#13;
quality of supply. Each program must be certified by the central government in order to operate.&#13;
This is the case even for public schools, where operated by the local municipality. The&#13;
certification requirements are steep (e.g. evaluated against a list of 50 indicators), but not&#13;
impossible for schools of good quality. The certification only takes place once every five years&#13;
which minimizes the administrative burden on local government. Schools that fail are given a&#13;
second chance to reform, with specific guidance to help them do so. The result was&#13;
comparatively few post-secondary vocational schools. Within the cityâ&#128;&#153;s remit (i.e. senior&#13;
vocational schools administered by the municipal government, not the provincial or national&#13;
government), there are only 9 senior vocational schools which confer a 3-year associate degree&#13;
(some also award a 4-year college degree), and 6 of these schools are privately administered.&#13;
This small number of schools helps to facilitate the flow of information about schoolsâ&#128;&#153; quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
192&#13;
    Vocational degree programs differ from vocational training programs. There are thousands of vocational training&#13;
programs across China; mostly private sector run and lightly regulated, these programs attract students for short&#13;
training courses (e.g. English classes). Vocational degree programs are multi-year training programs; increasingly&#13;
regulated by the government, these offer planned curriculums that develop specialized skillsets.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              239&#13;
&amp;#12;(i.e. less schools to keep track of), both among potential students (or their parents) and among&#13;
potential employers.&#13;
&#13;
Competition between schools was stimulated by improved transparency regarding&#13;
performance and the promotion of new providers. For instance, the average score on the&#13;
national exam of the incoming class of students for each school is made publicly available;&#13;
which reflects the caliber of the school and can influence future applicants and firms looking to&#13;
recruit or co-develop curriculums. The employment rates of recent graduates are also made&#13;
publicly available, which serves as an indicator to the government, firms and students about the&#13;
applicability of the curriculum, quality of the institution, and overall responsiveness of the school&#13;
to needs of firms. These are measures that are typically taken across China, and often at the&#13;
provincial or national level (however, there is little reason to believe cities elsewhere could not&#13;
undertake them within their jurisdiction). Finally, the city promoted private sector vocational&#13;
training programs, which was not necessarily the norm in China. This conversely reduced&#13;
barriers to entry and allowed more, potentially competitive, training providers to enter the&#13;
market, reducing the likelihood of a monopoly. Encouraging private sector providers thereby&#13;
stimulated competition, as the threat of new entrants (or degree programs) kept all schools&#13;
competitive.&#13;
&#13;
Changsha provided funding for public and private schools, with the provision of funding&#13;
linked to the number of students enrolled. In doing so, the government both rewarded high&#13;
quality institutions and incentivized schools to respond to the needs of students. For&#13;
example, Sany developed a worker training program for new hires and had its program certified&#13;
by the municipal government (Sany Technical School). While not available to all citizens, the&#13;
training was of exceptionally high quality and would improve the competitiveness of workers.&#13;
Instead of receiving direct funding from the government, the firm received tax credits, further&#13;
incentivizing the provision of high quality trainings â&#128;&#147; as well as potential spillovers.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the city improved linkages between vocational programs and firms, promoting&#13;
desired outcomes like improved curriculums and employment. The parks made frequent&#13;
linkages between vocational programs and firms, helping firms address their needs for skilled&#13;
labor. Some firms identified vocational schools on their own, due to increased transparency&#13;
measures regarding performance by the government. Cooperation between schools and firms&#13;
varied; in some cases, schools signed cooperation contracts with firms to provide tailored&#13;
curricula. In exchange, firms would host internships or recruit from these programs. These&#13;
agreements were not exclusive; in fact, it was not uncommon for firms to sign 30+ agreements to&#13;
ensure a variety of skills were developed to meet their needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 240&#13;
&amp;#12;The government also facilitated linkages between vocational schools and firms in order to&#13;
promote employment after graduation. The municipal government provided funding for on-&#13;
site career placement offices within schools and organized job fairs, while the talent service&#13;
centers within industrial parks held regular job fairs to connect students with hiring firms. Due&#13;
to these efforts, Changsha generated optimal outcomes like high rates of employment among&#13;
graduates and minimal â&#128;&#156;skill mismatchesâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
What was the Impact of these Efforts?&#13;
&#13;
The municipal talent attraction program alone has successfully attracted 102 â&#128;&#156;high level talentsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
and 17 start-ups in just 3 years. Through national programs, Changsha has recruited more than&#13;
10,000 professionals between 2009-2011,193 and has earmarked 30 million RMB to fund future&#13;
attraction programs. Key â&#128;&#156;talentsâ&#128;&#157; are helping to further diversify the economy, leading cutting&#13;
edge 3D printing companies and starting up firms in the emerging biomedical industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In terms of vocational training, interviewed firms reported that skilled labor has been relatively&#13;
easy to find, and noted that this had been a key factor in their decision to invest. One MNC&#13;
explained that they were so satisfied with the skills in Changsha that they planned to bring higher&#13;
value added production to their operations in the city. Factory-floor observation confirmed that&#13;
the largest firms were executing advanced production techniques, and that attrition and poaching&#13;

&amp;#12;Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth in the period of 2007-2012 was not due to efforts by the&#13;
municipal government alone, nor was it a result of the exceptional success of one industry.&#13;
The cityâ&#128;&#153;s success is due to a combination of factors, including inherited advantages, national&#13;
and provincial level policies, and municipal government initiatives. While only the most unique&#13;
and constructive factors are noted in this report194, these factors have positively impacted the&#13;
city, contributing to the competitiveness of firms and the growth of the economy.&#13;
&#13;
The most significant growth was in the manufacturing industry, which overtook the&#13;
services sector in terms of contribution to GDP since 2003 (see excerpt below from the&#13;
KPMG Investment Environment Report, 2013).195 In 2012, growth in the manufacturing industry&#13;
had increased from 2012 by about 278.5 billion CNY (about 46.5 billion USD). This was&#13;
primarily led by key industries such as: construction machinery, automobiles and parts,&#13;
household appliances, electronics, biological medicine and advanced materials. In terms of jobs,&#13;
the construction machinery industry alone accounted for over 100,000 jobs in Changsha196, and&#13;
with a multiplier of 5, indirectly created about 500,000 jobs (over 20% of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s labor force).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In sum, while inherited and national level factors provided the city with both an&#13;
increasingly competitive location (centrally located with improved external connectivity)&#13;
and an industry-specific knowledge base; success was ultimately dependent on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
efforts to leverage these factors in order to take advantage of economic opportunities.&#13;
National level factors were insufficient to trigger growth independent of municipal interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
194&#13;
     For example, many critiques note the questionable high levels of debt among cities and SOEs.&#13;

&amp;#12;It was the municipal government that leveraged advantages, providing support to firms across&#13;
industries and employing effective inter-agency coordination mechanisms that improved the&#13;
efficiency and responsiveness of government agencies. These measures helped the city to&#13;
develop globally competitive industries and successfully attract new firms and talent â&#128;&#147; further&#13;
diversifying, strengthening and ultimately, growing the economy.&#13;

&amp;#12;Lessons for Other Cities&#13;
&#13;
Changsha, a mid-sized, provincial capital city in central China, recorded very high absolute, and&#13;
relative, growth in terms of GDP and employment growth in 2007-2012. While this case study&#13;
does not certify that Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s success was unique nationally, or that its success will be&#13;
permanent, it does offer lessons for other cities (particularly for those outside China, but also&#13;
within) in how Changsha achieved such rapid growth as a national Tier 2 (or secondary) city:&#13;
&#13;
1. Firms become competitive, as a result of inter-firm competition and strong management&#13;
   capabilities. Evaluating firm competitiveness is critical to the identification, and subsequent&#13;
   prioritization, of pillar industries. Initiatives to promote competitiveness include:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ SOEs: Decentralizing authority to top managers, reducing support and government&#13;
           shares, and selling SOEs that cannot compete (sale of bankrupt SOE to Zoomlion).&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Private Firms: Different levels of assistance are offered in the early, mid and later&#13;
           stages in order to both avoid choosing winners and help those firms with potential to&#13;
           compete globally. In the early stage- offering market information to all firms; in the&#13;
           middle stage- offering industrial park land to firms that have demonstrated growth&#13;
           and job creation; in the later stage- providing support for R&amp;D, with tax credits to&#13;
           those demonstrating higher-value added production.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Foreign Firms: Enforcing the termination of preferential policies (e.g. tax breaks)&#13;
           after the introductory period and letting firms go that are uncompetitive or refusing to&#13;
           operate without excessive support (i.e. avoiding a â&#128;&#156;race to the bottomâ&#128;&#157;).&#13;
&#13;
2. Investing in information flows; both public and private can have a high impact, multiplier&#13;
   effect as a public good- especially for start-ups.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ The provision of market information can be a relatively cost-efficient way to provide&#13;
           support to multi-firm industries.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Allowing market information to become publicly available- for example publishing&#13;
           test scores of incoming students as an indicator of school quality- helps to inform&#13;
           consumers and consequently, promotes the success of the most competitive among&#13;
           firms (and schools).&#13;
&#13;
3. Improving cross-silo coordination by elevating problems (not approval processes), under&#13;
   disciplined monitoring and accountability mechanisms (e.g. Leading Groups). Whether&#13;
   through permanent agencies or temporary leading groups, inter-agency coordination can be&#13;
   improved by developing institutions that clearly designate responsible parties for specific&#13;
   issues, hold members accountable for resolving issues, require group members to meet at&#13;
   frequent intervals to â&#128;&#156;catchâ&#128;&#157; unsolved issues, and elevate problems that cannot be adequately&#13;
   solved to the next level. Monitoring success, in terms of the issues resolved vs. unresolved,&#13;
   further increases accountability among individual parties.&#13;
&#13;
4. Regulating and promoting competition among vocational training facilities helps cities to&#13;
   address common quality control problems in terms of relevant skill development. By&#13;
   requiring that all programs be certified in order to operate, and undergo regular evaluations to&#13;
                                                                                               245&#13;
&amp;#12;   maintain certification, cities can better regulate the type and number of degree programs&#13;
   available. The certification of schools is not intended to limit providers and allow schools to&#13;
   develop monopolistic positions; in fact, competition among schools is promoted by&#13;
   encouraging private and publicly managed schools to administer programs. Further, cities&#13;
   can better recommend and provide linkages to private sector firms more cost effectively by&#13;
   using verifiable statistics on performance to monitor school quality and desired outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
5. Attracting new talent as well as new investment improves the ability of cities to develop&#13;
   competitive industries. Cities with large populations can struggle to convert human resources&#13;
   into human capital, but talent attraction programs can contribute to this conversion, as part of&#13;
   a larger, multi-pronged approach to improve human capital. Best practices in talent attraction&#13;
   are similar to those in investment attraction: Target individuals in prioritized areas that could&#13;
   further contribute to the competitiveness of existing or emerging industries; provide limited&#13;
   preferential treatment (resettlement packages for stay of 3 years or more); and utilize&#13;
   diaspora networks as a low cost outreach tool as well as to attract individuals willing to make&#13;
   long-term investments in the city (and not leave for the next attractive package).&#13;
&#13;
6. Leveraging national level programs can increase the resources available to municipalities to&#13;
   implement new programs and initiatives. In the case of Changsha, the city successfully&#13;
   leveraged national level programs for talent attraction and strategically selected a nationally&#13;
   prioritized industry for its investment attraction efforts (e.g. automobiles). This not only&#13;
   saved the city money, as funding was available at the national level to support initiatives (e.g.&#13;
   funds to compensate certified â&#128;&#156;talentâ&#128;&#157; that relocated to the city) but reduced the need for the&#13;
   city to duplicate administrative efforts as well. Changsha even encouraged local firms to take&#13;
   advantage of national level programs, helping lead firms to attract thousands of new&#13;
   employees.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, these interventions relied on several conditions that were present in China, and while&#13;
we cannot know if these same interventions would be as effective in other environments, we can&#13;
identify a few of the scope conditions that boosted the effectiveness of interventions in this case:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Availability of financial resources: For instance, attracting foreign talent can require&#13;
   compensation or resettlement allowances, and the city must have additional funds available&#13;
   for these purposes (without otherwise draining funds for key services or vulnerable groups).&#13;
&#13;
2. Performance on cross-department initiatives: Interagency coordination efforts were&#13;
   undeniably supported by the fact that personnel had existing incentives to focus on cross-&#13;
   department outcomes (e.g., with the cityâ&#128;&#153;s growth affecting all officialsâ&#128;&#153; promotion prospects&#13;
   to a greater or lesser extent).&#13;
&#13;
3. Reliable, Nationally Standardized Tools: Vocational degree programs had high barriers to&#13;
   entry, but those that were in operation were of high quality. How did the government&#13;
   successfully develop a barrier to distinguish high quality from low quality programs? The&#13;
                                                                                                246&#13;
&amp;#12;municipal government had appropriate certification standards to distinguish programs as well&#13;
as significant authority to mandate curriculums. In terms of standards, the government relied&#13;
on available tools- such as nationally standardized test scores for high school students (which&#13;
were almost impossible to manipulate)- to measure the quality of existing institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           247&#13;
&amp;#12;Appendices&#13;
&#13;
Testing of Standardized Research Hypotheses&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the reportâ&#128;&#153;s Introduction, this is the fifth in a series of case studies of economically&#13;
successful cities around the world. In order to ensure comparability of â&#128;&#156;teachable momentsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
across all case studies, a set of standardized research hypotheses was tested in Changsha to&#13;
determine the exact scope for action at the metropolitan level, factors that may have most&#13;
affected how those prerogatives were used, and the extent to which specific interventions (and&#13;
how they were implemented) may have resulted in the economic outcomes observed.&#13;
&#13;
The first hypothesis tested seeks to determine to what extent Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s economic results were&#13;
attributable to proactively picking sectors to support, the second one looks at the strategic&#13;
planning process itself (if any) and how it may have affected economic growth, and the third one&#13;
looks at the planâ&#128;&#153;s implementation, if applicable.&#13;
&#13;
1. Changshaâ&#128;&#153;s recent economic success is attributable to its having made strategic bets on&#13;
   specific industry initiative, rather than just improving their general investment climate.&#13;
   Before making bets on specific industries or firms, the government did not select individual&#13;
   industries or firms as local champions, but allowed firms to demonstrate capability to&#13;
   compete           before           receiving         more         tailored          support.&#13;
&#13;
       a. Changsha is particularly well-known for its construction machinery industry. The&#13;
          two anchor firms in this industry, Sany (a private firm) and Zoomlion (an SOE)&#13;
          ranked #6 and #7 respectively globally in the construction machinery industry. They&#13;
          are global firms producing tradable goodsâ&#128;&#148;their products export to over 100&#13;
          countries and these two firms both have subsidiaries worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
           Other major industries in Changsha are new materials and automobiles &amp; parts.&#13;
           While they are not as prominent as the construction machinery industry, they help&#13;
           diversify the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic structure, enlarge the cityâ&#128;&#153;s tax base, and create job&#13;
           opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
       b. New business and industries appeared, together with the continued growth of&#13;
          existing firms. While Sany and Zoomlion grew rapidly from local homegrown firms&#13;
          to globally competitive firms in a matter of two decades, other new start-ups in the&#13;
          same industry also appeared. Some late-comers, such as Sunward, are said to be even&#13;
          more technologically advanced than the already established firms and these new firms&#13;
          are rapidly moving into global markets as well. Higher value-added new industries&#13;
          also start emerging, such as cultural and creative industry in the services sector and&#13;
          biomedical industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                248&#13;
&amp;#12;2. While Changsha had strategic plans for long-term economic and social development, such&#13;
   as the widely-quoted â&#128;&#156;five-yearâ&#128;&#157; plans, its policy interventions were largely planned and&#13;
   driven by opportunities identified by the market. The municipal government strategically&#13;
   planned and intervened in industries that can effectively capitalize on market trends and&#13;
   location advantages (e.g. the automobile and construction machinery industries). If certain&#13;
   firms (even key firms) were proven to be â&#128;&#156;outdatedâ&#128;&#157; in the market, the municipal&#13;
   government was ready to let these firms leave the city.197&#13;
&#13;
        a. In general, strategic plans in Changsha (and China) listed out general economic and&#13;
           social targets and can be served as a guidance to identify prioritized sectors or&#13;
           interventions. However, the wordings of these strategic plans are usually â&#128;&#156;vagueâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
           which left some space and flexibilities for local governments in terms of how they&#13;
           would design and plan to achieve the targets. For the case of Changsha, the Five-year&#13;
           Plan of 2001-2005 specified that Changsha should target to have the industry sector&#13;
           to be the main pillar of its local economy. The Five-year Plan of 2006-2010&#13;
           emphasized the need for Changsha to grow its industrial clusters and helped firms to&#13;
           move up the value chain. Changsha was traditionally strong in the consumer services&#13;
           sector, but within a 10-year timeframe (2001-2010), its economic structure&#13;
           transitioned from a consumer services dominated one to an industry sector dominated&#13;
           one, with some â&#128;&#156;starâ&#128;&#157; industrial companies and cluster well-known not only in the&#13;
           domestic market but also internationally. However, the analytics (or the existence&#13;
           of it), the detailed planning process are little known to the general public.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        b. There is no prominent â&#128;&#156;growth coalitionâ&#128;&#157; at the city level: while private sectorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
           concerns and problems are regularly communicated to government officials, and&#13;
           academics are hired by government as advisors, there is not a systematic mechanism&#13;
           to convene them to become a growth coalition.&#13;
&#13;
        c. While clearly there are strategic prioritization in different public investment&#13;
           alternatives, the process of this decision is not transparent and is little known to the&#13;
           public.&#13;
&#13;
        d. In Chinese cities, including Changsha, fiscal transfers from the central government,&#13;
           taxation on business, as well as profits from land leases account for a large part of&#13;
           local revenues which are used to finance city-level interventions. As the heavy use of&#13;
           special purchase vehicle companies to finance infrastructure projects is being&#13;
           discouraged in recent years, public-private partnerships (PPPs) are becoming more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
197&#13;
   For example, a renowned multinational firm used to produce CRT TV screens in one of the industrial parks in&#13;
Changsha. When the incentive package expired and the firm threatened to leave Changsha, the municipal&#13;
government did not engage in â&#128;&#156;race to the bottomâ&#128;&#157; competition to match the incentive package to keep the firm.&#13;
The firm eventually left and the factory space was turned into producing touch screens of smartphones.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         249&#13;
&amp;#12;           and more popular. This provides viable funding sources for Changsha. Changsha has&#13;
           maintained a balanced budget with a small surplus in recent years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Local government bodies in China played a huge role in the implementation of&#13;
   interventions aimed at fostering economic growth. The public sector has undertaken&#13;
   proactive interventions â&#128;&#147; through plans, infrastructure provision, and enterprise support â&#128;&#147; to&#13;
   spur economic development. Changsha government utilized Leading Group mechanisms to&#13;
   mitigate inter-agency coordination failures, leveraged national and provincial level programs&#13;
   and developed local programs to bring about the optimal outcomes of these proactive&#13;
   interventions.&#13;
&#13;
       a. In general, Chinese cities enjoy a relative high degree of fiscal and political autonomy&#13;
          compared with other cities globally. The Provincial Development &amp; Reform&#13;
          Committee, Commerce Bureau of Changsha, Commission of Industry and&#13;
          Information Technology of Changsha, and the Management Offices of various&#13;
          industrial parks in the city are the major government entities to set and achieve&#13;
          economic targets. However, it should be noted that since city leadership in China is&#13;
          heavily evaluated on the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance, city leadersâ&#128;&#148;not only the&#13;
          mayors but also leaders in all departmentsâ&#128;&#148;have the incentives to work together&#13;
          towards achieving economic targets. In general, all government entities have well-&#13;
          defined roles, autonomy, funding and geographic remits.&#13;
&#13;
       b. The Changsha municipal government utilized Leading Groups, inter-agency&#13;
          coordination mechanisms, to coordinate the implementation of interventions.&#13;
          Leading Groups are temporary committees that are convened for a specific initiative&#13;
          in order to coordinate among different departments and different levels of&#13;
          government. There is also a specific reporting mechanism in place that allows issues&#13;
          identified or raised by firms to be addressed in a timely fashion. If they are not&#13;
          resolved within the designated time frame by the responsible government&#13;
          departments, these issues will be ultimately taken to the mayor for mediation and&#13;
          resolution.&#13;
&#13;
       c. There is very limited private-sector or other stakeholder involvement in&#13;
          implementation.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                              250&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
This case study of the economic success of the Moroccan city of Tangier marks the sixth and&#13;
final report in a series of World Bank case studies of successful metropolitan economies around&#13;
the globe, under the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive Cities Knowledge Base (CCKB) project. Tangier is the&#13;
sole representative city for the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) Region.&#13;
&#13;
The CCKB project aims to provide city leaders with the tools and knowledge for the successful&#13;
formulation and implementation of proactive economic development strategies at the city level.&#13;
All six cities in this series have been studied using a uniform methodology, testing a set of&#13;
standardized research hypotheses (provided as an appendix to this report) to understand the&#13;
citiesâ&#128;&#153; economic success over the decade from 2002 to 2012, as well as any prior decisions or&#13;
additional factors that may have influenced economic outcomes over the period studied. The&#13;
studyâ&#128;&#153;s scope is limited to this timeframe in order to ensure the comparability of findings. In&#13;
functional terms, its focus is only on economic development (particularly job creation), not&#13;
related though interesting topics like national competitiveness or municipal service provision.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier is a mid-sized port city in a lower-middle income country, with a relatively highly&#13;
manufacturing-intensive economy and an expanding tourism sector. Tangier has enjoyed much&#13;
success in recent years in improving its residentsâ&#128;&#153; prosperity, and in many respects has made&#13;
significant progress in catching up with Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s other leading cities such as Casablanca and&#13;
Rabat. Indeed, over the past decade, Tangier has had one of the better performing metropolitan&#13;
economies in the MENA region in terms of GDP and employment growth.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier provides an example of a successful secondary city in an administratively highly&#13;
centralized (though gradually de-centralizing) country, which successfully leveraged a major&#13;
national economic development initiative to reinvent its own economic structure, integrate into&#13;
global value chains, significantly improve its human capital, create local employment&#13;
opportunities, and thus enhance the overall economic prosperity of its residents. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
success has been enabled by the Moroccan governmentâ&#128;&#153;s strategic decision to better integrate the&#13;
northern regions with the rest of the country, and to jump-start these areasâ&#128;&#153; development by&#13;
making major investments in physical infrastructure and human capital. None of the positive&#13;
outcomes observed were inevitable; indeed, a number of factors and local actors came together&#13;
to successfully translate this national initiative into robust economic results at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
This report is based on primary and secondary research by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Competitive Cities&#13;
Knowledge Base team, including two weeks spent in Morocco in December 2014, interviewing&#13;
government officials in Tangier, as well as members of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s business community. The&#13;
mission also met with representatives of national government agencies and business associations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               256&#13;
&amp;#12;in the administrative capital, Rabat, and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s main business hub, Casablanca. The report&#13;
also incorporates internal Bank staff feedback received during April 2015.&#13;
&#13;
This report was prepared by Z. Joe Kulenovic, with input and suggestions from Karim Amri,&#13;
Marie Cerceau, Philippe de Meneval, Andrea Liverani, and the broader CCKB team. The co-&#13;
TTLs of the CCKB project are Austin Kilroy and Megha Mukim. Overall guidance on the&#13;
project has been provided by Stefano Negri, Sameh Wahba, and Somik Lall as senior advisors.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
The Moroccan port city of Tangier provides an example of a secondary city successfully&#13;
leveraging a major national economic development initiative to accelerate its own growth,&#13;
and to move towards a more diversified economic structure. This is a process which has been&#13;
underway for well over a decade now, with highly visible results on the ground. But Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
success is not the story of a city content to just sit back and wait for the national authorities to&#13;
make things happen; local actors and institutions proactively seized upon this once-in-a-lifetime&#13;
opportunity to remake their local economy, crate jobs, and achieve a higher quality of growth.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier is one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s oldest and perhaps best known cities, harking back to&#13;
Phoenician and Roman times. Over several millennia of recorded history, the city had been&#13;
ruled by many powers before its reintegration into an independent Morocco in 1956. But given&#13;
its location at the northernmost tip of Africa, the Tangier-TÃ©touan region remained relatively&#13;
isolated from the rest of Morocco for nearly another half century after independence. Road and&#13;
rail connections were inadequate, air links expensive and infrequent, and domestic longshore&#13;
shipping underdeveloped. Getting products to markets in other parts of the country was more&#13;
challenging than just shipping them across the Strait of Gibraltar to Europe, less than ten miles&#13;
away. Even in the absence of free access to European and other foreign markets, Tangier&#13;
managed to develop a local textile and leather industry, in addition to its more traditional&#13;
economic mainstays such as fishing and food processing. These local industries have always had&#13;
an export component, even if it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t dominant during the era of economic autarky. In the final&#13;
decades of the 20th century, the city increasingly became a magnet for rural migrants from&#13;
villages throughout northern Morocco, even though the economic opportunities it could offer&#13;
were comparatively limited. It remained a regional center without greater aspirations.&#13;
&#13;
For decades, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth was centered on its mid-Atlantic coast between&#13;
KÃ©nitra in the north and El Jadida in the south, especially on the core Casablanca-Rabat axis,&#13;
while the countryâ&#128;&#153;s geographically remote regions remained poorly connected and economically&#13;
isolated. In particular, Greater Casablanca was fast becoming a megacity, with all the&#13;
accompanying challenges this brings, even as more peripheral regions stagnated and continued to&#13;
see an exodus of residents in search of jobs and opportunities. With the accession of the present&#13;
monarch in 1999, the national governmentâ&#128;&#153;s adopted essentially a twofold response to these&#13;
challenges: accelerate the construction of physical infrastructure to better connect the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regions to its core, and devolve some decision-making authority to the regional and local level.&#13;
&#13;
As the 21st century began, the Moroccan government made a far-reaching strategic&#13;
decision to make Tangier an alternate â&#128;&#156;poleâ&#128;&#157; driving Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth, in&#13;
addition to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s traditional business hub of Casablanca. Tangier already had a&#13;
reasonably well-developed local manufacturing sector, and its strategic location at the doorstep&#13;
                                                                                                258&#13;
&amp;#12;of the European Union as well as at the intersection of major global maritime routes provided&#13;
inherent advantages that could not be ignored. Much of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s maritime passenger traffic&#13;
with the EU, for example, passed through the port of Tangier. The national government therefore&#13;
decided to build a brand new seaport complex and logistics hub some 35 km east of the city of&#13;
Tangier itself, directly across the Strait from Gibraltar and Algeciras in Spain, and to properly&#13;
connect them to the rest of Morocco via modern transport infrastructure. The stage was thus set&#13;
for a chain of events which would end up transforming Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economy and turn it into a&#13;
major success story after decades of relative stagnation.&#13;
&#13;
Construction of the new seaport (called Tanger-Med) proceeded in parallel with major&#13;
upgrades to northern Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s road and rail connectivity. Improvements to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
transport infrastructure on this scale were unprecedented. Port construction unfolded in several&#13;
phases, eventually including multiple deepwater container terminals, roll-onâ&#128;&#147;roll-off (RO-RO)&#13;
facilities, a hydrocarbons storage facility, and a massive passenger ferry terminal. Railroads were&#13;
extended from the main national network right into the Tanger-Med port itself, enabling the&#13;
rapid intermodal transfer of containers, bulk cargo, and motor vehicles. Modern multilane&#13;
highways were built not just connecting the port complex to regional population centers such as&#13;
Tangier and TÃ©touan, but also connecting the entire north of the country to centers of economic&#13;
activity in the central Casablanca-Rabat area, and beyond. For the first time in history, Tangier-&#13;
based producers came to enjoy efficient access to domestic markets.&#13;
&#13;
To maximize the development impact of this massive infrastructure investment, in 2002 the&#13;
Moroccan government established the Tanger-Med Special Agency (TMSA). This umbrella&#13;
entity brings together the Port Authority and multiple free trade and logistics zones. It works&#13;
closely with various other local actors involved in trade, investment attraction, workforce&#13;
development, and regional decision-making. As a leading economic development-focused&#13;
agency, it has sweeping powers in key areas such as land acquisition and allocation, as well as&#13;
direct access to senior national decision-makers in Rabat. Among other things, TMSA has served&#13;
as an important transmission channel for articulating local needs to the national government.&#13;
&#13;
The relocation of Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s freight traffic to the new Tanger-Med port has enabled the&#13;
redevelopment of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s old seaport, renamed Tanger-Ville, into a tourism- and fishing-&#13;
focused maritime facility, along with high-end retail and residential developments. The free&#13;
trade zone previously located inside the port area has been decommissioned, its businesses&#13;
relocated to new areas outside the city core. A wall cordoning off the port from its city has been&#13;
torn down. New terminals for larger cruise ships and pleasure craft are under construction.&#13;
Implemented in several phases, the portâ&#128;&#153;s conversion is still ongoing. In 2010, a sister&#13;
organization to TMSA called SAPT (SociÃ©tÃ© dâ&#128;&#153;AmÃ©nagement pour la Reconversion de la Zone&#13;
Portuaire de Tanger) was established as a public-private partnership to coordinate all these&#13;
activities, and to serve as a focal point for the transformation at the heart of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s waterfront.&#13;
                                                                                                   259&#13;
&amp;#12;SAPT has also played an important role in ensuring stakeholder buy-in, particularly from some&#13;
relatively small but socially and politically important constituencies like fishermen.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier has worked hard to reconcile its dual ambitions to simultaneously serve as a&#13;
manufacturing hub and a leading tourist destination. This was achieved through extensive&#13;
stakeholder consultation and visionary transportation planning, by measures that included the&#13;
above-mentioned port redevelopment, relocating manufacturing firms outside the city core to&#13;
newly-built, designated facilities with adequate infrastructure, designating prime locations as&#13;
â&#128;&#156;touristâ&#128;&#157; zones while reserving the flexibility to rezone areas as needed, and encouraging foreign&#13;
investment in industrial plants and tourism. After decades of neglect and uncontrolled urban&#13;
sprawl, special attention was paid to environmental protection and mobility. Tangier has been,&#13;
for example, the first Moroccan city to achieve 100% coverage of urban households with vital&#13;
municipal services like water and sewerage, according to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s current Mayor.198 Priorities&#13;
such as environmentally sustainable development, flood control, the preservation of green&#13;
spaces, beach and seawater cleanliness, transportation access, and the deployment of renewable&#13;
energy are all seen by local leaders as critical economic development issues (for tourism as well&#13;
as investment attraction), not just citizensâ&#128;&#153; quality of life concerns.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier and Morocco have successfully capitalized on some geographic, historical, cultural,&#13;
advantages to foster local and regional economic growth. Lying less than ten miles from the&#13;
southern shores of the European Union gives Tangier unrivalled access to the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest&#13;
common market. At the same time, the cityâ&#128;&#153;s location astride a shipping route handling a fifth of&#13;
the worldâ&#128;&#153;s maritime commerce presents major opportunities to participate in global value&#13;
chains. Tangier also enjoys a reputation as a cosmopolitan, tolerant place, and its people have the&#13;
ability to conduct business in multiple languages. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s pleasant climate, without extremes&#13;
of heat or cold, is highly conducive to tourism development. National and local leaders have&#13;
successfully leveraged these advantages to market the city both nationally and internationally,&#13;
attracting investment, trade flows, and tourists.&#13;
&#13;
Multiple planning documents, and their implementation, have contributed to Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economic success. The national government has produced national five-year plans focused on&#13;
economic and social development, which were in turn complemented by regional development&#13;
plans. The Tangier-TÃ©touan region and municipalities in it have also produced a number of other&#13;
planning documents, some with assistance from European partners. However, it is difficult to&#13;
gauge precisely how much of a role each of these individual strategies has had; ultimately the&#13;
implementation of decisions made at the national level in Rabat may have mattered the most.&#13;

&amp;#12;Tangier does not have a focal economic development organization, but several entities from&#13;
both the public and private sector have a role in fostering investment and job creation in&#13;
the city. These include: the regional governorate (Wilaya); the central and regional/local offices&#13;
of national agencies (e.g. for workforce development, tourism, territorial development); the&#13;
Urban Community (i.e. elected city government); TMSA and SAPT; the Regional Investment&#13;
Center (CRI); the Agency for the Promotion and Development of the North (APDN); institutions&#13;
of higher learning, especially Abdelmalek EssaÃ¢di University; the Chamber of Commerce,&#13;
Industry and Services; the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM); the Tangier&#13;
Industrial Zone Association (AZIT); and various other private-sector groups and associations. In&#13;
a very real sense, these entities form a de-facto growth coalition, even if the exact mechanisms&#13;
for its activities are not necessarily formalized. With about a million inhabitants, Tangier is not a&#13;
huge city; most key decision-makers know each other personally and interact on a regular basis.&#13;
There appears to be a very high level of social capital, aided by the conscious efforts of key local&#13;
actors to build up mutual trust and work together for results.&#13;
&#13;
What are the reasons for Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic success? Its recent exemplary performance is&#13;
attributable to a combination of factors:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   First, Tangier has benefitted immensely from being part of a stable, rapidly&#13;
       expanding Moroccan economy. The country has made tremendous strides in recent&#13;
       years, liberalizing its economy, removing barriers to external trade and investment, and&#13;
       enabling its firmsâ&#128;&#153; closer integration into global supply chains. As mentioned earlier,&#13;
       some devolution of decision-making for economic development to the regional and local&#13;
       levels, as well as national sectoral development policies and support tools, have provided&#13;
       strong impetus to economic growth and job creation in the Tangier-TÃ©touan region.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Second, Tangier has benefitted from a strategic national focus on northern Morocco.&#13;
       After decades of stagnation, the Moroccan government has made development of the&#13;
       countryâ&#128;&#153;s northern areas a key priority, making unprecedented investments in transport&#13;
       infrastructure, funding various local initiatives, working to attract catalyst investments,&#13;
       and encouraging international business and tourism through marketing, promotion, and&#13;
       other enabling activities.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Third, Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s success has been helped by significant local capacity to further the&#13;
       cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development, including high-quality human resources and capable&#13;
       leadership at key government agencies, officialsâ&#128;&#153; ability to constructively work together,&#13;
       effective stakeholder engagement, adeptness at utilizing national tools and capitalizing on&#13;
       initiatives to foster local job creation, knowledge of products and markets, and the use of&#13;
       internationalization as a deliberate economic development strategy, among other things.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Fourth, Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s recent economic success has been facilitated by inherent&#13;
       geographic, historical, and cultural advantages, and successful local efforts to build&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 261&#13;
&amp;#12;    upon and expand them further. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s location along major shipping routes, its&#13;
    proximity to Europe, pleasant climate, diverse topography, rich cultural heritage, and&#13;
    tradition of multiculturalism, diversity, and tolerance, have all been successfully&#13;
    leveraged to attract visitors and investors alike. In addition, residentsâ&#128;&#153; ability to function&#13;
    in multiple languages gives it an edge over most comparable locations when seeking to&#13;
    attract international commerce and tourism. Tangier is a safe, welcoming city.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Fifth, Tangier had a relatively diversified economic (particularly manufacturing)&#13;
    base even before the national governmentâ&#128;&#153;s transformative infrastructure investments. It&#13;
    was home to sizeable local production in sectors such as machinery, metal works,&#13;
    chemicals, apparel and leather goods, handcrafts, and food processing. Local firms had&#13;
    existing know-how to later adapt and become suppliers to major foreign manufacturers&#13;
    like Renault. The new opportunities brought about by the completion of Port Tanger-Med&#13;
    enabled local firms to further integrate into global value chains, upgrading their&#13;
    technologies and workforce skills, and enabling growth in new, higher value-added&#13;
    segments like automotive and aerospace, gradually transforming the local economy.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Sixth, Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s ability to attract outside firms has been helped by its generally&#13;
    adequate levels of human capital at highly competitive wage levels, as well as&#13;
    successful labor market intermediation programs and efforts. Having workers with&#13;
    the appropriate skills sets, or the ability to quickly attain them, has been an important&#13;
    factor in attracting investment. Where existing skills were insufficient, the national&#13;
    workforce agency ANAPEC stepped in, working with employers, the local university,&#13;
    and training providers to develop workforce training programs addressing these needs.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Seventh, beyond wages Tangier offers some other very tangible bottom-line business&#13;
    advantages, which have been an important consideration for outside investors.&#13;
    Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s national business climate has been rapidly improving in recent years, and&#13;
    Tangier has lower logistics costs than the rest of the country due to its proximity to&#13;
    Europe and new state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities. Tangier (and Morocco) offer&#13;
    reliable power supply and other infrastructure, but at lower land costs and operating costs&#13;
    than competitor sites in southern Europe. Yet it is not a â&#128;&#156;low-costâ&#128;&#157; location as such, but&#13;
    rather offers a compelling value proposition in terms of cost-quality and time-to-market&#13;
    tradeoffs. Tangier enjoys a particular advantage in attracting firms serving the European&#13;
    market, which need quick turnaround times (e.g. aerospace components or fast fashion).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              262&#13;
&amp;#12;So What? Summary of Insights for Other Cities from What Tangier Did Right&#13;
&#13;
Some valuable lessons from Tangier include:&#13;
&#13;
1. If implemented correctly, major national initiatives really can have a transformative&#13;
   effect on local and regional economies; but local capacity is essential. Successful city&#13;
   economic development is seldom a matter of pouring vast resources into a flagship project&#13;
   and just hoping it pays off â&#128;&#147; a â&#128;&#156;build it and they will comeâ&#128;&#157; approach. Indeed, more often&#13;
   than not, such an approach results in little more than ribbon-cutting ceremonies for what&#13;
   ultimately end up being white elephants. Beyond the obvious matter of financial, economic,&#13;
   and environmental sustainability, the projectâ&#128;&#153;s broader ecosystem â&#128;&#147; the economic,&#13;
   institutional, political, and societal milieu in which the capital investment occurs â&#128;&#147; can&#13;
   determine whether it accomplishes more than just its immediate goals, such as living up to&#13;
   traffic flow forecasts and delivering the benefits originally anticipated. Truly transformative&#13;
   initiatives are planted in â&#128;&#156;fertile groundâ&#128;&#157;, where local actors and institutions can skillfully&#13;
   leverage them to accomplish quantum leaps in economic outcomes. Such a thing happened&#13;
   in Tangier with the construction of the new port of Tanger-Med: local know-how and&#13;
   entrepreneurial energy were mobilized to use the new facility as a means of integrating into&#13;
   global value chains, in the process increasing residentsâ&#128;&#153; shared prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Why has Tangier been successful at leveraging a major national initiative where so many&#13;
    other cities have failed? The answer is a multi-faceted one, and includes a combination of&#13;
    path-dependent and subjective factors. Tangier is fortunate to be located where it is, and to&#13;
    be endowed with all the natural advantages it has. But local actors exhibited a phenomenal&#13;
    grasp of global business trends and market opportunities, and managed to collaborate with&#13;
    one another to make these external factors work in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s favor. They have also been&#13;
    exceptionally skilled at making good use of the tools provided by the national government,&#13;
    such as investment incentives and workforce development programs. Highly effective&#13;
    information feedback loops and responsiveness from higher tiers of decision-makers&#13;
    complete the picture of how success can be achieved under such circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
2. Engaging diverse stakeholder groups in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development efforts early&#13;
   on, and finding ways to bring them into an effective growth coalition â&#128;&#147; whether formal&#13;
   or not â&#128;&#147; is an important enabler of success. The CCKB teamâ&#128;&#153;s prior work on case studies&#13;
   of economically successful cities has revealed a consistent pattern: involving private for-&#13;
   profit firms and their associations, educational institutions, civil society groups, quasi-public&#13;
   entities as well as various tiers of government dramatically increases the probability of a city&#13;
   achieving its desired economic outcomes. Tangier very much confirms this pattern, its&#13;
   diverse stakeholder groups successfully partnering with government to accomplish shared&#13;
   goals and adequately respond to the once-in-a-generation opportunity the city was presented&#13;
   with. This is much more than a â&#128;&#156;consultativeâ&#128;&#157; process or â&#128;&#156;iterative dialogueâ&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; it entails&#13;
   different entitiesâ&#128;&#153; substantive participation the decision-making process, stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; shared&#13;
   sense of ownership of those decisions, and shared responsibility for implementing what has&#13;
                                                                                                263&#13;
&amp;#12;    been agreed. National governments can build ports and roads and offer incentives, but they&#13;
    cannot substitute for the entrepreneurial energy of individual businesspeople, or the inter-&#13;
    personal relationships within a community that are so vital to getting things done on the&#13;
    ground â&#128;&#147; and by extension, to ensuring successful economic outcomes at the city level.&#13;
&#13;
3. Globalization can be a highly effective element of a cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development&#13;
   strategy. If done with some forethought, going international can be among the most&#13;
   beneficial things a city can proactively do for its residentsâ&#128;&#153; long-term prosperity. Cities do&#13;
   not set (national) trade policies, have no ability to impose tariffs on imports, or restrict&#13;
   foreign competitors from the local market. But what they can do is take full advantage of&#13;
   what their national frameworks allow (including through free trade deals, bilateral&#13;
   investment treaties, and open skies agreements) to attract investors from abroad to their&#13;
   communities, as well as to help home-grown firms better integrate into global value chains.&#13;
   Once a critical threshold is reached, a cityâ&#128;&#153;s globalization often gains momentum of its own.&#13;
   Gradually â&#128;&#147; but perhaps irreversibly â&#128;&#147; Tangier appears to have gone down this path.&#13;
&#13;
    Tangier is an obvious poster child for the benefits of globalization at the city level. Indeed,&#13;
    Tangier was global long before being global became â&#128;&#156;coolâ&#128;&#157;. In its former heyday as a â&#128;&#156;free&#13;
    international cityâ&#128;&#157;, Tangier was comparatively prosperous, hosting an eclectic mix of people&#13;
    from many different countries, speaking a multitude of languages. This was followed by&#13;
    several â&#128;&#156;closedâ&#128;&#157; decades, in which this port city no longer played the role of commercial&#13;
    hub, contributing to its relative stagnation. Finally, in the new millennium Tangier appears to&#13;
    have come full circle: it is now once again a bustling port and export-oriented production&#13;
    center, with rising employment and incomes. The leaders of todayâ&#128;&#153;s Tangier do not seek&#13;
    protection from the global economy â&#128;&#147; they embrace it. Foreigners are not seen as a threat,&#13;
    they represent an opportunity â&#128;&#147; not just to seal commercial deals, but to spread worldwide an&#13;
    awareness of Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s business acumen, natural beauty, welcoming people, and rich&#13;
    cultural heritage. The Mayor shuttles to international trade fairs inviting firms to invest in his&#13;
    city, while the local leadership rolls out the welcome mat to business and leisure visitors&#13;
    alike. Existing foreign investors are bringing in their suppliers, and telling the international&#13;
    business community of how profitable their Tangier operations are. Once again, the&#13;
    Tangerois are improving their multiple language skills, and the city is attracting the attention&#13;
    of global business. This appears to be Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s natural condition, and a role it plays&#13;
    exceptionally well. It is something other cities could indeed learn from.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  264&#13;
&amp;#12;The National Context&#13;
&#13;
During much of the 20th century, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance was quite lackluster.&#13;
Pursuing statist, autarkic policies like import substitution and the protection of favored domestic&#13;
industries, the country was essentially stagnant as measured by various economic and social&#13;
indicators. It was leapfrogged by comparable economies, both in its own region and elsewhere&#13;
around the world, in terms of growth in per capita GDP, literacy levels, and various other&#13;
measures of development. Indeed, growth in economic output was barely keeping pace with&#13;
demographic increases. Economic opportunities were limited, and many Moroccans sought a&#13;
better life by emigrating abroad, particularly to European countries like France and Spain, with&#13;
whom Morocco has enjoyed longstanding historical, cultural, and linguistic ties.&#13;
&#13;
In the 20th century, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth was geographically extremely uneven. The&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s mid-Atlantic coastal plain between KÃ©nitra in the north and El Jadida in the south, and&#13;
especially its central section between the commercial capital of Casablanca and Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
administrative seat, Rabat, attracted the lionâ&#128;&#153;s share of investment, jobs, and internal migration.&#13;
In particular, Greater Casablancaâ&#128;&#153;s population surged, in just a few decades becoming one of the&#13;
largest cities in Africa, with all the attendant challenges that come with being a megacity.&#13;
Roughly half of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s industrial production, and most of its higher value-added industries,&#13;
came to be concentrated in the Casablanca area. Meanwhile, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s more peripheral regions&#13;
stagnated, continuing to experience outflows of residents in search of jobs and opportunities.&#13;
Housing shortages were severe in various Moroccan cities, and transport infrastructure both&#13;
within and between major urban centers wholly inadequate. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s northern areas, with&#13;
their historical legacy of having been administered (by Spain) separately from the rest of&#13;
Morocco prior to independence in 1956, were particularly isolated â&#128;&#147; logistically, economically,&#13;
and in some respects socially. Integrating Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s diverse regions was therefore emerging as a&#13;
critical imperative for the national economy, and for public policy in general.&#13;
&#13;
The accession of His Majesty King Mohamed VI in 1999 marked the beginning of a new&#13;
era for Morocco. Reforms already underway were accelerated and deepened, in the process&#13;
dramatically transforming Moroccan society in just a few short years. Major strides were made&#13;
in improving educational outcomes, addressing longstanding gender issues, and chronic housing&#13;
shortages throughout the country, particularly in rapidly-growing cities. Domestic state-owned&#13;
monopolies were dismantled and privatized, and foreign investors welcomed in, both to foster&#13;
market competition and to ensure the introduction of new technologies and ways of doing things.&#13;
More responsibility was devolved to sub-national units of government (regions, prefectures,&#13;
provinces, and municipalities) across a range of functional areas; this process of decentralization&#13;
is still ongoing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               265&#13;
&amp;#12;The new millennium also saw a much greater openness of the Moroccan economy to the&#13;
outside world. Free trade agreements were concluded with the US, EU, Turkey, and various&#13;
Middle Eastern and African countries, visa requirements abolished or relaxed for visitors from&#13;
many nations, and open skies agreements concluded, enabling low-cost international air travel.&#13;
Rather than just cater to a closed domestic market, Moroccan firms began to enjoy more success&#13;
in international markets, especially by exporting fisheries, olives and olive oil, fruits, and later&#13;
higher value-added products like autos, aerospace, and pharmaceuticals. The investment climate&#13;
has been improving, with Morocco seeing gradual but substantial improvements in international&#13;
Doing Business-type rankings. Among other measures, relaxing rules on foreign ownership,&#13;
establishing investment â&#128;&#156;one stop shopsâ&#128;&#157;, and stepping up proactive investment promotion&#13;
activities all contributed to increasing FDI inflows into Morocco, particularly into sectors like&#13;
finance, telecoms, transport, manufacturing, offshoring (services), and tourism/hospitality.199&#13;
&#13;
Over the past decade, the Moroccan economy has been one of the better performers in the&#13;
Middle East and North Africa region. Reforms begun in the 1980s and 1990s, and accelerated&#13;
in the early 2000s, have not just helped Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economy become more competitive, but also&#13;
more resilient in the face of external shocks. After several years of healthy GDP expansion in the&#13;
early 2000s, Morocco managed to weather comparatively well the global â&#128;&#156;great recessionâ&#128;&#157; of&#13;
2008-09, without seeing its economy contract in any single year. Since then, growth has picked&#13;
up again: after expanding by 2.7% in 2012, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s GDP grew by a more robust 4.4% in&#13;
2013, and is on track to post annual growth rates in excess of 4% over the next few years,&#13;
according to World Bank forecasts. In current dollar terms, the size of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s annual&#13;
economic output more than doubled in a decade, reaching US$104 billion in 2013. Meanwhile,&#13;
also from 2003 to 2013, per capita income also more than doubled, posting growth of 104%,&#13;
according to data based on the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Atlas method.200&#13;
&#13;
Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s export-driven growth in the 21st century has been led by a handful of sectors as&#13;
principal earners of foreign currency, in particular tourism, food/seafood, and fertilizers.&#13;
Tourism has been an important part of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s recent prosperity, capitalizing on the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
natural attractions and rich cultural heritage to draw millions of visitors, boosting both export&#13;
earnings and sustaining jobs. Agriculture and food processing also remain a mainstay of the&#13;
economy, accounting for some 15-20% of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s GDP and a disproportionately large share&#13;
of employment in rural areas. Exports of agricultural products and seafood are vitally important&#13;
to the nationâ&#128;&#153;s economy, as are phosphates for use as fertilizer. But unlike many other countries&#13;
in the region, Morocco is not endowed with (proven) oil and gas deposits, and in fact imports&#13;

&amp;#12;most of the hydrocarbons it consumes. This in turn has provided some impetus for the&#13;
development of renewable energy sources like wind and solar, relying on the natural resources&#13;
which the country does have in abundance. By inviting global leaders in those technologies into&#13;
its energy market, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s policy has also been to foster the development of a nascent local&#13;
renewable energy industry, gradually building up local capabilities while minimizing&#13;
environmental impacts.&#13;

Morocco has made great strides in reducing unemployment in recent years, but is now&#13;
prioritizing further raising its levels of human capital as a vital enabler of competitiveness.&#13;
Growth in labor-intensive industries like tourism has helped to bring down the nationwide&#13;
unemployment rate, which has remained in single-digit territory for much of the past decade.&#13;
However, finding suitable jobs remains a challenge, particularly for urban graduates and women.&#13;
Indeed, female participation in Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s labor force is still only around 26%, compared to&#13;
about one half in other comparable economies at a similar stage of development. Still, the&#13;
unemployment rate for both women and youth has been steadily declining, with some regional&#13;
variations within the country. Crucially, while formal educational attainment has improved&#13;
dramatically, there continues to be some disconnect between the â&#128;&#156;fundamentalâ&#128;&#157; knowledge with&#13;
which students are graduating, and real-world skills needed by prospective employers.&#13;
Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s government is well aware of this, and has taken concrete measures to gradually&#13;
transition from a traditional, French-influenced model of largely theoretical education, towards&#13;
more applied, practically-focused curricula. Modern workforce development and labor market&#13;
intermediation programs seek to ensure a better match between skills and employer needs, also&#13;
aligned with national sector development priorities.&#13;
&#13;
Far from being complacent about recent economic results, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s national government&#13;
is actively working to identify and address remaining developmental challenges in a&#13;
structured, systematic way. While recent growth has been impressive, national policymakers&#13;
are highly cognizant of the need for further progress on modernizing Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
structure, diversifying its exports, attracting more foreign investment, continuing to improve the&#13;
business climate and infrastructure, and raising the levels of human capital. For example,&#13;
agriculture continues to account for a disproportionately large share of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economy and&#13;
employment base. Exports have been increasing at a rapid clip, but much of what the country&#13;
exports has until fairly recently largely consisted of low value-added agricultural products and&#13;
fisheries. There is an awareness that Moroccan producers can no longer compete in the global&#13;
marketplace primarily on price, yet technological innovation is only gradually beginning to gain&#13;
traction. Policymakers are well aware of the dangers of falling into a middle-income trap, rolling&#13;
out a series of nationwide initiatives aimed at laying the foundation for the â&#128;&#156;next economyâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              267&#13;
&amp;#12;To jump-start the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic development, the Moroccan government launched a&#13;
series of sectoral strategic plans in the mid-2000s. Designed to speed up the development of&#13;
strategic sectors like agriculture, fisheries, energy, and logistics, as well as promising industries&#13;
like automotive and aerospace, these strategies were developed with substantial input from the&#13;
private sector. The plans were to be implemented both directly by the government, and through&#13;
innovative public-private partnerships, thus ensuring stakeholder buy-in and long-term&#13;
sustainability, while enabling the government to focus more on its core regulatory functions&#13;
&#13;
Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s industrial strategy was dubbed â&#128;&#156;National Pact for Industrial Emergenceâ&#128;&#157; (or&#13;
simply â&#128;&#156;Emergenceâ&#128;&#157;), released in 2005, then revised in 2009. The strategy was aimed at&#13;
revitalizing and strengthening the competitiveness of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s existing industrial base, as well&#13;
as identifying and supporting new promising sectors in which the country may have a&#13;
competitive advantage. Collectively, the seven industrial sectors selected for proactive support&#13;
were expected to account for 70% of near-term industrial growth in Morocco, increase GDP by&#13;
an additional MAD 90 billion, and result in the creation of 400,000 new jobs by 2015.201&#13;
&#13;
Emergence was a comprehensive document, based on robust analytics. The original plan, as&#13;
well as its subsequent revision, utilized a systematic process to identify the countryâ&#128;&#153;s competitive&#13;
strengths in specific industries and their individual segments, taking into account broader global&#13;
business and macroeconomic trends, benchmarking Morocco relative to the competition, and&#13;
coming up with specific interventions to capitalize on market opportunities. Among other things,&#13;
these include an incentives framework, the construction of new physical facilities like seaports&#13;
and upgrades to existing infrastructure, and instituting training programs for targeted industries.&#13;
While led by the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and New Technologies, a plethora of other national&#13;
government agencies have had a role in the planâ&#128;&#153;s development and implementation â&#128;&#147; and at the&#13;
regional level, in collaboration with other tiers of government and private-sector partners.&#13;
&#13;
Emergence set numerical goals for each of the seven sectors targeted as â&#128;&#156;growth enginesâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
for Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s industrial development:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Automotive Industry: Creating an industrial base which includes both final auto&#13;
          assembly, and an expanding network of automotive component suppliers. The goal was&#13;
          to create some 70,000 to 80,000 direct jobs in the industry, with an annual value added of&#13;
          MAD 10 billion.&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Aerospace: The goal was to create 10,000 aerospace-related jobs (mostly in aerospace&#13;
          components manufacturing) and generate an additional MAD 3 billion in value added.&#13;

&amp;#12;      â&#128;¢   Electronics: Focus on specialty electronics and integrated circuits, related to the other&#13;
          targeted sectors, aiming to create more than 10,000 jobs and MAD 5 billion in new value&#13;
          added.&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Business Process Outsourcing/Offshoring: Capitalizing on Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s multilingual&#13;
          workforce (particularly workers speaking French and/or Spanish), the goal was to create&#13;
          100,000 new jobs, generating over MAD 15 billion annually.&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Food Processing: The objective was to develop specialty production in 8 to 10 agro-&#13;
          industrial niches, aiming to create an additional 6,000 jobs and more than MAD 5 billion&#13;
          in value added.&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Seafood Processing: Production of higher value-added halieutics and export of frozen&#13;
          products, helping to support an additional 35,000 Moroccan jobs and more than MAD 3&#13;
          billion in value added.&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Textiles and Leather: Carving out profitable market niches such as fast fashion and co-&#13;
          contracting, with a goal to create 50,000 jobs and more than MAD 5 billion in value&#13;
          added.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Progress on achieving these goals is monitored on an ongoing basis, and inter-institutional&#13;
effectiveness ensured through a formalized consultative process.202&#13;
&#13;
Besides these seven industrial sectors, there are additional, separate multi-year strategic&#13;
plans for the development of other priority sectors, as mentioned above. More specifically,&#13;
Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s government has formulated dedicated strategic plans for the development of&#13;
agriculture (Maroc Vert), the retail and distribution sector (Plan Rawaj), aquaculture and&#13;
fisheries (Plan Helieutis), tourism (Vision 2010, then Vision 2020), the energy sector, and&#13;
logistics (StratÃ©gie Nationale de DÃ©veloppement de la CompÃ©titivitÃ© Logistique), as well as&#13;
upgrading the countryâ&#128;&#153;s ICT capabilities (Maroc Numeric 2013), which plays an enabling role&#13;
by cutting across various sectors of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economy.&#13;

Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic success is in part the result of the successful localization of national&#13;
sector development strategies and application of support tools. While national in scope, all of&#13;
the above plans also have implications at the local level, and have to varying degrees contributed&#13;
to the recent economic outcomes observed in Tangier. Reasons for their relatively more&#13;
successful implementation in Tangier are manifold, and range from strong local capacity and&#13;
social capital/interpersonal relationships, to broader global economic trends favoring the city.&#13;

Urban and Regional Economic Development in Morocco: Framework and Key Actors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Comparatively speaking, Morocco is not yet a highly urbanized country. While there has&#13;
been a massive shift of people from the countryside to the cities, today only 57% of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
33 million people live in urban areas, a much lower proportion than in other countries at a similar&#13;
level of development. Its system of cities is dominated by the economic powerhouse of Greater&#13;
Casablanca, along with the nearby administrative center of Rabat. Outside the central coastal&#13;
plain, inland cities like Marrakesh, Fez, and Meknes are also sizeable population centers, while&#13;
Agadir serves as the hub for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s southern regions. Tangier is the largest city in the&#13;
northern part of the country, and its region is one of 16 units into which Morocco is divided.&#13;
                                                                                               270&#13;

Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s Investment Promotion Agency (Agence Marocaine de DÃ©veloppement des&#13;

   Reflective of the lingering influence of French administrative traditions in Morocco, this has been both a process&#13;
of â&#128;&#156;deconcentrationâ&#128;&#157; and of â&#128;&#156;decentralizationâ&#128;&#157; (in the strict sense of the word). The distinction is more than just a&#13;
sematic one. See, for example, Decentralization and Local Governance in MENA: A survey of Policies, Institutions,&#13;

&amp;#12;national industrial strategy, to spur foreign investment into the seven targeted sectors. As the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s FDI promotion agency, AMDI works to brand and market Morocco globally as an&#13;
investment destination, but also to generate investment leads and provide business recruitment,&#13;
expansion, and retention services to multinational firms. Leads are generated through a&#13;
combination of in-house research, subscriptions to standard FDI databases, and referrals from&#13;
existing investors, land developers, site selectors, or other â&#128;&#156;multiplierâ&#128;&#157; organizations such as&#13;
professional services firms. A key stated objective is the diversification of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s FDI&#13;
inflows beyond traditional markets like France and Spain, to include more investment from other&#13;
European and North American countries, Japan, and large emerging-country multinationals. The&#13;
agency has offices in several key FDI source markets around the world, and runs a multilingual&#13;
investment promotion website. It also works very closely with local and regional authorities,&#13;
particularly for the provision of hands-on site selection services, as well as in implementing its&#13;
excellent program of investor aftercare.204 AMDI has at its disposal a standard toolkit of highly-&#13;
effective investment incentives that can be deployed to seal FDI deals (see box).&#13;
&#13;
National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills (Agence Nationale de&#13;
Promotion de l'Emploi et des CompÃ©tences â&#128;&#147; ANAPEC): ANAPEC is Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s principal&#13;
labor market intermediary, seeking to match up job seekers with employer needs. The agency has&#13;
a network of offices all over Morocco, and a sophisticated online tool that enables job seekers to&#13;
explore and identify the kinds of functional roles in which they might perform well, as well as&#13;
connect with specific openings, both in Morocco and abroad (employers in other countries can&#13;
seek out Moroccan job applicants through ANAPEC). In addition, ANAPEC organizes job&#13;
interview workshops for job seekers and employers, and provides assistance to employers in&#13;
defining their human resource needs. An innovative program helps prospective entrepreneurs&#13;
(particularly recent graduates, school drop-outs, the very young, unemployed, or self-employed)&#13;
to define and operationalize their entrepreneurial ideas, thus encouraging the formation and&#13;
growth of new businesses. Finally, ANAPEC is involved in retraining and continuing education,&#13;
taking part in 3-sided agreements with employers and training providers (e.g. OFPPT, or private&#13;
education centers). These customized training agreements stipulate that, by a particular deadline,&#13;
workers will be trained to acquire the specific skills needed by the employer, and that they will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
204&#13;
    At the beginning of each year, AMDI staff put together a list of 40-50 foreign companies in Morocco. Then they&#13;
visit their facilities on-site, discuss their satisfaction with how their investment in Morocco is working out, and focus&#13;
on addressing any concerns or problems they may have encountered. Progress towards achieving the objectives&#13;
stipulated in incentives agreements is monitored within a 3-year window, and assessments made about their&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                    273&#13;
&amp;#12;be guaranteed jobs once they do acquire those skills; ANAPEC picks up the cost of the&#13;
training.205&#13;
&#13;
In Tanger-TÃ©touan, ANAPEC also carries out labor market studies in various targeted sectors,&#13;
often working directly with companies in them, to understand the firmsâ&#128;&#153; future staffing needs,&#13;
and by extension to project the regionâ&#128;&#153;s overall skills and training needs in the years to come.&#13;
ANAPEC interfaces with other government agencies and key stakeholders through a dedicated&#13;
mechanism called CRAM (ComitÃ© Regional dâ&#128;&#153;AmÃ©lioration de lâ&#128;&#153;EmployabilitÃ©), which among&#13;
others includes representatives of the Wilaya, CRI, professional associations, and the university.&#13;
CRAMâ&#128;&#153;s role is to analyze the studies and action plans prepared by ANAPEC, and to validate or&#13;
correct its estimates of training needs anticipated for each sector. CRAM has four specialized&#13;
sector commissions: automotive &amp; aerospace; transport &amp; logistics; offshoring; and tourism. On&#13;
the whole, this model has been highly successful, with the Tangier office regularly reaching its&#13;
ambitious annual job placement and skills development goals, thereby playing an important&#13;
enabling role in companiesâ&#128;&#153; efforts to establish local operations.&#13;
&#13;
Office of Professional Training and Employment Promotion (Office de la Formation&#13;
Professionnelle et de la Promotion du Travail â&#128;&#147; OFPPT): OFPPT is Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s main public&#13;
provider of vocational training, ensuring that the sectors targeted for proactive economic&#13;
development efforts have an adequate supply of qualified workers with the skills needed by&#13;
employers. OFPPTâ&#128;&#153;s sector priorities closely adhere to those in the Emergence plan, i.e. with a&#13;
strong emphasis on automotive, aerospace, offshoring, tourism, logistics, and other targeted&#13;
sectors. With more than 320 centers and 7,100+ instructors all over Morocco, OFPPT delivers&#13;
over 90% of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s publicly-supplied training. OFPPT works closely with ANAPEC,&#13;
which often funds its training activities.206 The two agencies also share a database of people&#13;
trained at the local level, facilitating the matching of skills available with those actually needed.&#13;
&#13;
It is important to distinguish between general skills formation, and customized (â&#128;&#156;Ã  la carteâ&#128;&#157;)&#13;
training. Both at the national and local levels, OFPPT partners with representatives of industries&#13;
and employers, labor unions, other government agencies involved in economic development, and&#13;
civil society groups (for women, persons with disabilities, youth, charitable foundations, etc.).&#13;
Such entities are represented on OFPPTâ&#128;&#153;s Board (Conseil dâ&#128;&#153;Administration), and are consulted in&#13;
the design of OFPPTâ&#128;&#153;s general training curricula. At the national level, OFPPTâ&#128;&#153;s steering&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
205&#13;
    Examples of this include ANAPECâ&#128;&#153;s agreement with AMICA (the automotive industry association) to train&#13;
20,000 employees with the specific skills needed by 2017, and another agreement with local SMEs in Tangier to&#13;
train workers for social jobs under a â&#128;&#156;Solidarity Economyâ&#128;&#157; initiative.&#13;
206&#13;
   ANAPEC matches workers with jobs, analyzes market needs, and pays for worker training, but does not actually&#13;
carry it out â&#128;&#147; OFPPT does. The two agencies have complementary but distinctive roles.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          274&#13;
&amp;#12;committee meets with representatives of professional associations and other stakeholders every&#13;
six months, while at the regional level meetings are held on an ongoing basis year-round.&#13;
OFPPTâ&#128;&#153;s national and regional Organs de Gouvernance are the consultative mechanisms for&#13;
private industry to provide feedback on their skills needs (but not all industries are represented in&#13;
all regions). Universities do not participate in designing the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s curricula, but university&#13;
graduates sometimes seek out additional training by OFPPT to obtain usable workplace skills,&#13;
while conversely people without formal degrees can use training received from OFPPT to count&#13;
towards such degrees in the future. OFPPT also works hand in hand with AMDI to ensure that&#13;
foreign companies can get suitably-skilled workers for the jobs they want to create or retain.&#13;
&#13;
Maroc Export: Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s export-promotion agency was created in 1979, under the name of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Moroccan Center for Export Promotionâ&#128;&#157;, to facilitate the exporting of manufactured goods,&#13;
agricultural products, and fisheries. Until a few years ago, the functions of promoting exports&#13;
and inward FDI were combined under the same entity, but now FDI is handled by a separate&#13;
agency, AMDI. Administratively under the Ministry of Foreign Trade (the Trade Minister is its&#13;
Chairman of the Board), Maroc Export now has 88 employees, all based in Casablanca. It does&#13;
not have any field offices around the country, instead partnering with CGEM, local chambers of&#13;
commerce, and sector associations to organize export-related workshops for Moroccan firms.&#13;
Each year, Maroc Export participates in about 140 promotional events around the world, on&#13;
average assisting 700-800 Moroccan companies from 20 sectors, in some 40 targeted export&#13;
markets. The agencyâ&#128;&#153;s sector priorities are aligned with national sector development plans&#13;
(currently, about 60% of the companies supported are in priority sectors). Maroc Export supports&#13;
the export operations of Moroccan companies through the following kinds of specific activities:&#13;
market intelligence207, risk analyses, organizing and subsidizing208 attendance at international&#13;
trade fairs/exhibitions, promotional campaigns, branding, and holding trade-related road shows&#13;
and capacity-building workshops within Morocco. The goal is to help 200 new companies each&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
Maroc Export maintains a database of all companies in Morocco which export products. In 2013,&#13;
Tanger-TÃ©touan ranked second only to Greater Casablanca among Moroccan regions, accounting&#13;
for 12% of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s total merchandise exports. There were 646 exporting companies in the&#13;
region, only 16 of which participated in Maroc Exportâ&#128;&#153;s programs. Broken down by sector, those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
207&#13;
   Maroc Export staff carry out country and sector studies, as well as event-specific analyses, mostly in-house. On&#13;
rare occasions when additional highly specialized product or country knowledge is needed, they contract such&#13;
analyses out to specialized consulting firms. Quality intelligence is seen as absolutely critical to market success.&#13;
208&#13;
   Maroc Export covers up to 80% of the cost of Moroccan firmsâ&#128;&#153; attendance at trade shows, with differential tariffs&#13;
for B2B events. Higher rates of support are provided for exporting to non-traditional markets, which is a priority. In&#13;
addition, as of this year, large companies that draw in SMEs as suppliers get a 5% discount on services.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 275&#13;
&amp;#12;firms cover: agribusiness (4 companies), leather and plastics (3 each), textiles (2), and one firm&#13;
each in the seafood, automotive, electronics, and water treatment industries. In terms of export&#13;
value, the top sector by far is automotive, skewed by exports from the vast Renault factory.&#13;
&#13;
National Tourism Confederation (ConfÃ©dÃ©ration Nationale du Tourisme â&#128;&#147; CNT):&#13;
&#13;
Founded in 1995, CNT is a private-sector industry association affiliated with CGEM, focused on&#13;
promoting tourism as a major engine of the Moroccan economy. It also serves as the umbrella&#13;
organization for all of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s Regional Tourism Councils, which are represented on its&#13;
Board (including two delegates from Tanger-TÃ©touan). CNT works to set the strategic direction&#13;
on major cross-functional projects in the tourist industry, working closely with the Moroccan&#13;
government, particularly the Ministry of Tourism. Tourism already supports about a fifth of all&#13;
jobs in the country, and has been an important pathway out of poverty for many Moroccans. As&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s tourism offering grows and diversifies, one of the priorities for CNT is also to&#13;
ensure that hospitality-related establishments can find the workers with the appropriate skills.&#13;
&#13;
Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s national tourism strategy documents (Vision 2010, followed by Vision 2020) sought&#13;
to significantly boost visitation to the country as a whole, as well as to develop Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s global&#13;
tourism brand beyond just Marrakech. The initial national goal was to raise the number of&#13;
foreign visitors to Morocco from 4.4 million in 2001 to 10 million by 2010 (nearly fully&#13;
accomplished, at 9.3 million!), then to double that again to 20 million by 2020. In addition to&#13;
raising tourismâ&#128;&#153;s share of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s total GDP to 20%, the planning documents also&#13;
envisaged tripling accommodation capacity and revenues from the industry, while becoming the&#13;
first â&#128;&#156;sustainableâ&#128;&#157; tourist destination in the Mediterranean region. From the national perspective,&#13;
ensuring the balanced growth of tourism in all of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s regions was both an economic and&#13;
political imperative. To that end, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s tourism planning process was collaborative and&#13;
inclusive. Officially launched by HM King Mohamed VI, the Vision documents were formulated&#13;
jointly by the national government, CNT, the 16 Regional Tourism Councils, private-sector&#13;
tourism businesses, and stakeholders at large. Road shows were held all over Morocco to solicit&#13;
stakeholder input and ideas about tourism development. Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s regions sought to identify&#13;
their particular strengths and weaknesses, and understand what might be needed for the Visionsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
effective implementation. Contract Programs were signed among the key actors, with each&#13;
region deciding what its own developmental priorities should be, while CNT made sure they&#13;
were aligned with each other and with the national branding and promotion efforts. Aggressive&#13;
marketing campaigns were undertaken abroad, particularly in European and Middle Eastern&#13;
markets, including attendance at trade fairs and other standard tourism promotion channels.&#13;

Moroccan Logistics Development Agency (Agence Marocaine de DÃ©veloppement de la&#13;

for Moroccans by capturing higher value-added activities in the global logistics industry. In&#13;
Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s case, that meant capitalizing on the flow of cargo through the Strait of Gibraltar.&#13;
Logistics was identified as one of the main sectors to target for regional economic development&#13;
efforts. To this end, AMDL has worked with APDN, the Wilaya, TMSA, and other key local and&#13;
regional actors to ensure that they got the appropriate support from the national government in&#13;
developing MedHub and related logistics facilities, as well as the accompanying infrastructure,&#13;
around the port of Tanger-Med, and that the StratÃ©gie Nationale de DÃ©veloppement de la&#13;
CompÃ©titivitÃ© Logistique mentioned earlier would be successfully implemented in the region.&#13;

&amp;#12;Local Context&#13;
&#13;
Tangier is the largest city and principal center of economic activity in northern Morocco.&#13;
Tangier is the capital of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s Tanger-TÃ©touan Region, which had 3.033 million inhabitants&#13;
and an estimated GDP of nearly US$ 8 billion in 2012. Covering a surface of 11,570 km2 , the&#13;
region consists of two Prefectures (Tanger-Assilah and Mâ&#128;&#153;diq-Fnideq) as well as five Provinces&#13;
(Chefchaouen, Fahs-Anjra, Larache, Ouazzane, and TÃ©touan). Together with its neighboring&#13;
region of Taza-Al HoceÃ¯ma-Taounate, this area of northern Morocco has a combined population&#13;
of 4.9 million, just under half of whom (47.8%) live in urban areas, compared with Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
overall urbanization rate of 58.8%. Approximately one million people reside within the Tangier&#13;
metropolitan area itself. While it has made substantial advances in economic development in&#13;
recent years, the Tanger-TÃ©touan Region remains slightly less affluent than Morocco as a whole,&#13;
with a per capita income of MAD 21,682 in 2012 (or 85.4% of the national average).&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                           279&#13;
&amp;#12;Located just ten miles from Europe, Tangier is influenced by its geography to a greater&#13;
extent than most other cities. Situated at the crossroads of global commerce, where continents&#13;
and civilizations meet, it has traditionally been a maritime, outward-looking city. In an earlier,&#13;
autarkic era, Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s location in a remote corner of the African continent was a distinct&#13;
disadvantage, implying isolation from the mainstream of its national economy and a marginal&#13;
economic role. In the globalized marketplace of the 21st century, however, the situation is exactly&#13;
reversed: Tangier is now a natural gateway, the place where worlds come together and where&#13;
cross-border business gets done. This narrative will trace Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s evolution from stagnant&#13;
economic backwater to booming entrepÃ´t and manufacturing hub within a very brief time span.&#13;
&#13;
History&#13;
&#13;
Tangier is one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s oldest and perhaps best known cities, harking back to&#13;
Phoenician and Roman times. Over several millennia of recorded history, the city was ruled by&#13;
many world powers, then for several decades enjoyed the status of a free â&#128;&#156;international cityâ&#128;&#157; not&#13;
administered by any individual country. It developed a reputation as a multicultural, tolerant&#13;
place, where people of many different nationalities and religions came together to do business&#13;
with one another, but also to avoid the constraints often encountered in their countries of origin.&#13;
The mild climate attracted artists and writers from all over the world, who moved there to create&#13;
some of their masterpieces. International banking and insurance flourished as enablers of&#13;
international commerce, with multiple languages being spoken. Located in the very heart of the&#13;
city, Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s port was an important hub for commerce, but at times also for illegal activities.&#13;
&#13;
Moroccan independence in 1956, and Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s reintegration with its hinterland,&#13;
reoriented the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic activities. International commerce diminished in importance, as&#13;
European and other countries erected barriers to imports, while Morocco itself embarked on a&#13;
path of import-substitution and related economic policies fashionable at the time. Tangier went&#13;
from being an international trading city to a minor regional production center within Morocco,&#13;
vastly eclipsed by the countryâ&#128;&#153;s Casablanca-Rabat core. Internal migrants from impoverished&#13;
rural areas of northern Morocco naturally gravitated to Tangier as the main population and&#13;
economic center in that part of the country, resulting in significant population growth over time.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier was relatively isolated both geographically and economically during the second&#13;
half of the 20th century. Given its location at the northwestern tip of Africa, Tangier remained&#13;
quite isolated from the rest of Morocco for nearly half a century after independence. Road and&#13;
rail connections were inadequate, air links pricey and highly regulated, and cross-strait links with&#13;
Spain still relatively underdeveloped, although the frequency of passenger ferry services between&#13;
the two countries did rise over the years, resulting in a gradual increase in tourist visitation and&#13;
especially in transit traffic through the city. High logistics costs and administrative obstacles&#13;
were a real detriment to the competitiveness of local producers: access to consumer markets&#13;
                                                                                                280&#13;
&amp;#12;elsewhere in Morocco was slow and inefficient, while trade barriers and bureaucratic restrictions&#13;
in practice limited how much could be produced and traded internationally.&#13;
&#13;
Even during the â&#128;&#156;closed economyâ&#128;&#157; years, companies in Tangier managed to build up&#13;
manufacturing know-how and enhance knowledge of products and industrial processes.&#13;
Despite the lack of free access to European and other foreign markets, or ways to easily reach the&#13;
majority of Moroccan consumers, Tangier still managed to develop a local textile and leather&#13;
industry, as well as production in chemicals and selected metal and mechanical manufacturing&#13;
industry segments. These largely built off the cityâ&#128;&#153;s longstanding competencies like handicrafts&#13;
and artisan production, but attained more of an industrial scale over time. At the time, this was&#13;
largely low-technology, labor-intensive production, but it did help to build basic local capacity,&#13;
business acumen and workforce skills, accumulate capital, and hasten development of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
indigenous industrialist class. Geographically, this production was centered on the old seaport,&#13;
site of a TFZ, and later on the AZIT industrial zone located outside the cityâ&#128;&#153;s historic core. At the&#13;
same time, other traditional mainstays like fishing and food processing retained their importance.&#13;
&#13;
The accession of a new Moroccan monarch in 1999, combined with evolving external&#13;
circumstances, set in motion a chain of events that would end up transforming Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economy during the first decade of the 21st century. As noted earlier, before the turn of the&#13;
millennium, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth was extremely uneven geographically, heavily&#13;
dominated by the central Casablanca-Rabat core. With the accession of HM King Mohamed VI&#13;
in 1999, rebalancing the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth, both geographically and across sectors,&#13;
emerged as an overriding policy priority for the central government, and national sector&#13;
development plans (outlined in a prior section of this report) were drawn up and implemented.&#13;
&#13;
The strategic decision to make Tangier an alternate â&#128;&#156;poleâ&#128;&#157; driving Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
growth was made at the highest levels of national government, and strongly endorsed by&#13;
the new King himself. Various agencies at different tiers of government were involved in&#13;
operationalizing this decision, in consultation with organizations representing the private sector&#13;
such as: CGEM (the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises); the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce, Industry and Services; and various sector guilds/industry associations. As far as&#13;
development of northern Morocco is concerned, national interventions to accomplish this were&#13;
undertaken in two principal ways:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢   Through massive investments in physical infrastructure, including but not limited to the&#13;
          construction of new roads, railways, a brand new mega-seaport on the Strait of Gibraltar,&#13;
          and enhanced municipal infrastructure for the provision of basic services.209 Additionally,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
209&#13;
    A figure of US$17.8 billion over the period 2008-2014 is provided by www.tangerfreezone.com, but that&#13;
includes infrastructure investments beyond just the Tanger-TÃ©touan Region.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    281&#13;
&amp;#12;       significant funds were allocated to the construction of tens of thousands of new housing&#13;
       units in the Tanger-TÃ©touan Region, helping to at least partly alleviate the shortage of&#13;
       suitable dwellings endemic in many Moroccan cities. Public funding (including budget&#13;
       and debt financing) and donor funds were used to catalyze even greater resources from&#13;
       domestic and international private-sector investors, through a variety of PPPs and other&#13;
       modalities common in high-income countries, but at the time relatively new to Morocco.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Support for increased economic activity, both through proactive efforts to recruit outside&#13;
       investors, and through support programs for existing local firms to better adapt to the&#13;
       global marketplace, including participation in global value chains. These activities were&#13;
       closely tied in with the aforementioned national sector development strategies, and&#13;
       comprised investment incentives (including land), capital access programs, the provision&#13;
       of technical advice and guidance, export assistance, as well as dedicated workforce&#13;
       development and labor market intermediation programs â&#128;&#147; achieving a very high impact.&#13;
&#13;
While prioritizing Tangier as a driver of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economic development was ultimately&#13;
a political decision, it was based on sound economic rationale and robust analytics. Not only&#13;
was there tremendous potential for the north to achieve catch-up growth, but favorable external&#13;
developments such as new free trade agreements and the increase in shipping activity through the&#13;
Strait of Gibraltar presented new opportunities for Morocco to seize a greater share of higher&#13;
value-added activities related to international commerce. This would best be accomplished by&#13;
becoming a major transhipment hub on the Strait, through which more than a quarter of the&#13;
worldâ&#128;&#153;s seaborne cargo was already passing â&#128;&#147; right outside the city of Tangier. These market&#13;
opportunities were identified through a structured process at both the national and local levels.&#13;
&#13;
The introduction of ever-larger oceangoing freight vessels meant that brand new terminals&#13;
were needed to accommodate them, which Tangier (and Morocco) did not have in the early&#13;
2000s. Upgrading Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s existing port, located in the center of town and home to an existing&#13;
free trade zone mostly producing textiles and seafood, was deemed impractical. The old in-town&#13;
port would never be able to accommodate the large container ships (and especially future post-&#13;
Panamax sized ones) which Morocco wanted to attract, nor was there adequate landside access&#13;
for such an expanded volume of commerce, given that the port was boxed in by the old Medina&#13;
and other cultural monuments, as well as high-density urban housing. In consultation with local&#13;
stakeholders, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s government therefore decided to construct a brand new seaport facility&#13;
some 35 km east of the city, directly across the Strait from Gibraltar and Algeciras in Spain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             282&#13;
&amp;#12;The Port of Tanger-Med I, with Algeciras (Spain) and Gibraltar visible across the Strait&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Begun in 2002, construction of the new seaport complex (named Tanger-Med) was one of&#13;
the largest infrastructure projects in African history. It entailed a multi-billion dollar&#13;
investment in civil works to transform a pristine stretch of northern Moroccan beach just 14 km&#13;
from Gibraltar into a deepwater harbor (18-meter draft) with two separate container terminals,&#13;
and an adjacent 250-ha logistics hub/free zone and intermodal services zone (called MedHub)&#13;
directly behind the port. Beginning operations in 2007, Tanger-Medâ&#128;&#153;s first phase (Tanger-Med I)&#13;
is one of the largest intermodal facilities on the Mediterranean, as well as Africaâ&#128;&#153;s biggest&#13;
container port, with an initial annual capacity of 3.2 million TEUs. Right next to it a passenger&#13;
ferry terminal was constructed, with 8 berths able to handle up to 50 departures per day and 7&#13;
million Africa-Europe passengers and 700,000 trucks per year, roll-onâ&#128;&#147;roll-off (RO-RO)&#13;
facilities with a capacity of one million vehicles, and a hydrocarbons storage facility. Finally, a&#13;
further expansion currently under construction and planned to be completed by 2016 (Tanger-&#13;
Med II) will add two more container terminals, more than doubling the portâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to over 8&#13;
million TEUs. Container terminal operations have been tendered out under 30-year concessions&#13;
to specialized entities with vast experience and global commercial networks: APM Terminals&#13;
(part of the Maersk Group), and the Italian-German EUROGATE-Contship consortium&#13;
(consisting of MSC, CMA-CGM and Comanav). Today Tanger-Med is connected to 56 ports in&#13;
40 countries. Container traffic at Tanger-Med has been rising rapidly in recent years to surpass&#13;
2.5 million TEUs in 2013, while total cargo traffic reached 35 million tons, thus already making&#13;
Tanger-Med the countryâ&#128;&#153;s second-largest hub for maritime traffic after Casablanca.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               283&#13;
&amp;#12;Recent Developments and Their Significance&#13;
&#13;
Given that Tanger-Med was designed from the outset to be more than just a gateway for&#13;
the movement of freight and people, it forms part of an interconnected regional system of&#13;
industrial and logistics zones. Unlike other seaports in the country, which are managed by the&#13;
national port operator Marsa Maroc, Tanger-Med has a unique governance regime, under its own&#13;
dedicated Tanger-Med Special Agency (TMSA). In line with Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s sectoral and regional&#13;
development priorities, TMSA oversees an integrated network of six industrial and free zones&#13;
located within an 80-km radius of the port of Tanger-Med itself. Its value proposition for&#13;
potential investors includes the offer of an â&#128;&#156;integrated industrial platformâ&#128;&#157;, with efficient&#13;
production and logistics, ease of market access, large labor pool, and low operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
The motivation for undertaking such a massive infrastructure investment of nationwide&#13;
significance and impact went beyond just improving the efficiency of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s transport&#13;
sector. Tanger-Med was envisaged under Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s logistics sector strategy, and was to be used&#13;
as a catalyst for the economic development of the entire Tanger-TÃ©touan Region, and northern&#13;
Morocco as a whole. Besides the transshipment of containers from one vessel to another, the&#13;
intent was to capture a share of higher value-added logistics services along both east-west and&#13;
north-south shipping routes, attract international investors to Morocco as a platform for&#13;
production and export, and boost local producersâ&#128;&#153; competitiveness by lowering transport costs.&#13;
&#13;
Construction of the new seaport complex proceeded in parallel with major upgrades to&#13;
northern Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s road and rail connectivity. Railroads were extended from the main&#13;
national network right into the port of Tanger-Med itself, enabling the rapid intermodal transfer&#13;
of containers, bulk cargo, and motor vehicles. Upgraded infrastructure and new rolling stock&#13;
resulted in less congestion, higher average track speeds, and enhanced safety along northern&#13;
Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s railroads. Plans were announced to build Africaâ&#128;&#153;s first high-speed passenger railroad&#13;
(Ligne Ã  Grande Vitesse, or LGV, modeled after Franceâ&#128;&#153;s TGV) which, when completed in the&#13;
next couple of years, will reduce travel times between Tangier and Casablanca to only about an&#13;
hour and a half. Modern multilane highways were built not just connecting the Tanger-Med port&#13;
complex to regional population centers like Tangier and TÃ©touan, but also to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s main&#13;
Casablanca-Rabat axis. Finally, the facilities at Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s Ibn Battouta Airport were substantially&#13;
upgraded in 2008, tripling its passenger capacity just as open skies agreements with EU and&#13;
other countries enabled greater frequency of air services by low-cost carriers in particular. To&#13;
finance these unprecedented improvements to northern Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s transport infrastructure, its&#13;
national government utilized a combination of funding mechanisms, including issuing debt&#13;
obligations and involving various international donors and private, for-profit concessionaires.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               284&#13;
&amp;#12;Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s improved transport infrastructure simultaneously accomplished multiple, but&#13;
related economic and political objectives, with far-reaching impacts:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Northern Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s better connectivity and integration with the rest of the country;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   More efficient market access (domestic as well as international) for Tangier-based&#13;
       producers and exporters, conferring a meaningful cost advantage and ease of participation&#13;
       in global value chains;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Greater attractiveness of the Tanger-TÃ©touan Region to foreign investors, due to lower&#13;
       transport costs and shorter shipment times;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Easier and cheaper access for foreign tourists, enabling increased visitation to the city and&#13;
       region by leisure travelers, in turn helping to bolster the local tourism industry.&#13;
&#13;
The construction of Tanger-Med I and the infrastructure upgrades associated with it de-&#13;
facto transformed Tangier from an isolated, minor regional center into one of the best&#13;
connected, most cost-competitive business locations on the Mediterranean. An ultramodern&#13;
mega-seaport, efficient landside access, and improved air connections managed to turn Tangier&#13;
into one of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s best connected business locations in a time span of only a few short years&#13;
â&#128;&#147; a feat seldom observed in local economic development. Multinational firms, site selectors,&#13;
bilateral and multilateral collaborative bodies, the business press, and even academicsâ&#128;¦ all of a&#13;
sudden, Tangier began to appear on their radar screens as a very serious contender for all sorts of&#13;
operations. The city came to be seen for what logically it should have been all along: a â&#128;&#156;near-&#13;
shoreâ&#128;&#157; hub only a few miles from southern Europe yet outside the EUâ&#128;&#153;s legal regime, offering a&#13;
good quality of life, duty-free access to the single EU market, an inexpensive yet reasonably&#13;
skilled workforce, competitive land, energy, and other general business costs, and a national&#13;
government committed to attracting (and, when needed, incentivizing) FDI. Tanger-Med thus&#13;
managed to become an example of what has often been attempted, but seldom successfully&#13;
accomplished â&#128;&#147; a project serving as a catalyst for urban and regional economic development.&#13;
The reasons for this success are both external and location-specific, with more detail below.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure upgrades were accompanied by the successful local implementation of&#13;
national sector development strategies, starting in the early to mid-2000s. As noted earlier,&#13;
Emergence and other national planning documents had identified the sectors with the highest&#13;
potential to drive Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s economy forward. The national strategies were successfully&#13;
operationalized at the local level in some industries already present in Tanger-TÃ©touan, or with&#13;
clear advantages to take root there:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Transport and logistics&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Automotive&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Aerospace&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Agri-business, including seafood processing&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Textiles and leather&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                285&#13;
&amp;#12;       â&#128;¢   Electronics and mechanical engineering&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Services offshoring (BPO/ITES, including customer support)&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Tourism&#13;
&#13;
How was national sector targeting implemented at the local level? Five broad categories of&#13;
sector-specific interventions were observed in Tanger-TÃ©touan, each of which has likely played&#13;
some role in scaling up economic activity in those targeted industries. They include:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Investment promotion: Carried out in partnership between national and local entities,&#13;
           this includes the identification of potential investment targets in each sector, and outreach&#13;
           activities to inform them about the business potential of Morocco and Tangier more&#13;
           specifically. Via the web, through AMDIâ&#128;&#153;s network of international offices, referrals&#13;
           from existing investors, and other common channels, MNCs were contacted and&#13;
           relationships built to understand their locational needs in terms of further expansion, very&#13;
           much in line with global best practices in investment promotion. Credible leads/prospects&#13;
           were referred to CRI as the focal point for processing them, often also involving TMSA,&#13;
           the TFZ, the Wilaya, Tangier Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s office, or any other entity whose participation may&#13;
           have been needed or beneficial to bring in a specific investor. A shared understanding of&#13;
           inward FDI being critical to Tanger-TÃ©touanâ&#128;&#153;s development and prosperity seems to have&#13;
           been present among all the key actors, at both the national and local/regional levels.210&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Entrepreneurial support programs: Besides attracting outside investors, growth in&#13;
           targeted sectors can be given added momentum by implementing programs aiming to&#13;
           help existing firms scale up and create jobs, as well as by fostering the growth of new&#13;
           ones. In Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s case, this has included the assessment of industry-specific needs,&#13;
           development of managerial and technical know-how, product and process improvement,&#13;
           various technical certification programs and standards, language instruction, capital&#13;
           access programs and tax breaks211, export assistance and market information, and the&#13;
           identification and addressing of industry-specific administrative and regulatory issues.&#13;
           Technology transfer programs are still in their infancy, but national legislation has in&#13;
           recent years moved towards making it easier for research/educational institutions to&#13;
           collaborate with private for-profit businesses. A variety of institutions, both public and&#13;
           private, are involved in local needs assessment and the implementation of national&#13;
           support programs, among them the Chamber of Commerce, CGEM, AZIT, TFZ, sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
210&#13;
      Based on interviews and extensive discussions with the staff of these organizations in December 2014.&#13;
211&#13;
    For example, although SMEs account for 95% of all firms in Morocco, capital access remains a serious&#13;
challenge for many of them, and therefore an impediment to establishing and scaling up productive activities. To&#13;
address these financing gaps, the central government has instituted several programs, including grants, loans, and&#13;
credit guarantees, such as: the Moukawalati bank loan guarantee program; the Imtiaz program, which covers a&#13;
portion of firmsâ&#128;&#153; start-up costs; and the Moussanada program, providing cash grants to strengthen firmsâ&#128;&#153; strategy&#13;
and organization. While these capital access programs are not restricted to the targeted sectors, by supporting&#13;
company formation and growth they likely provide support to the Moroccan economyâ&#128;&#153;s most dynamic and vibrant&#13;
segments, which are likely to include the sectors targeted under Emergence and other strategic plans.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              286&#13;
&amp;#12;    associations, Abdelmalek EssaÃ¢di University, Maroc Export, ANAPEC, as well as&#13;
    various other local and regional government bodies, as appropriate in each situation.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Integration of local firms into global supply chains: In essence, achieving this entails&#13;
    establishing linkages between the previous two categories of interventions â&#128;&#147; attracting&#13;
    international companies to Tangier, then helping them develop a local supplier base&#13;
    among existing Tangerois firms. Unlike what the CCKB team has observed in some other&#13;
    countries, very few international investors in Tangier have formal supplier development&#13;
    programs, and the process is as reliant on ad-hoc relationship building as it is on any&#13;
    systematic approach. However, economic logic and global competitive pressures drive&#13;
    the MNCs to source locally as many intermediate inputs into their production processes&#13;
    as they can, thereby minimizing transport costs, delays, and supply chain risks. In the&#13;
    automotive industry, for example, building up local capacity and know-how has actually&#13;
    been easier than might be expected, given its specific segments in which Tangier has&#13;
    emerged as a player â&#128;&#147; automotive seats and fabrics, wiring harnesses and cables, steel&#13;
    stamping, plastic injection and sealing, steering wheels, A/C and safety systems, etc. All&#13;
    these build on Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s accumulated expertise in more traditional industries like textiles,&#13;
    chemicals, and metal works, so the transition to producing what carmakers like Renault&#13;
    need, for example, has proceeded fairly smoothly. An important intermediation role was&#13;
    played by AZIT, TMSA, and TFZ management, keen on strengthening the linkages&#13;
    between their tenants and the multinational firms being brought in.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Sector-specific infrastructure: The provision of industry-specific physical facilities,&#13;
    including suitable industrially-serviced land, dedicated railroad terminals, ro-ro facilities,&#13;
    gantry cranes, storage facilities, cruise ship berths, yacht marinas, beaches and nature&#13;
    preserves, road spurs and connectors, upgraded fiber-optic links, fish processing areas,&#13;
    waste disposal and materials recycling, flood control and prevention, etc. has helped to&#13;
    create the enabling conditions and environment needed by firms in the targeted sectors,&#13;
    locally-grown ones as well as outside investors. Depending on the specifics, these&#13;
    interventions may have been undertaken by the local branches of national agencies&#13;
    (coordinated through the Waliâ&#128;&#153;s office), as well as by municipal authorities or the&#13;
    different entities under the TMSA umbrella. Advocacy for such interventions is often&#13;
    channeled through the Chamber of Commerce and/or CGEM, in a feedback loop&#13;
    stretching back to the national government agencies in Rabat.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Dedicated workforce development programs: Morocco as a whole has made&#13;
    tremendous strides in raising its levels of human capital, prioritizing improved basic&#13;
    education as well as greater female enrollment and attainment. In terms of specific skills&#13;
    needed by targeted sectors, mechanisms (called Organs de Gouvernance) exist at both&#13;
    the national and regional levels for private industry to provide feedback to OFPPT,&#13;
    ANAPEC, and the universities about their particular skills needs. ANAPEC periodically&#13;
    funds studies of sectoral workforce needs, and partners with the universities or other&#13;
    accredited entities on delivering the training needed. HR managersâ&#128;&#153; and sectoral&#13;
    professional associations in Tanger-TÃ©touan have the chance to express their needs and&#13;
    concerns through four dedicated sectoral commissions (automotive/aerospace, transport/&#13;
    logistics, offshoring, and tourism). There is much flexibility in designing local training&#13;
    programs that are actually relevant to what employers seek. In addition to this general&#13;
    training for jobs in individual sectors, the Moroccan government also funds customized&#13;
                                                                                              287&#13;
&amp;#12;       training programs (called â&#128;&#156;formation Ã  la carteâ&#128;&#157;) tailored to the needs of individual&#13;
       employers. Utilizing a combination of these various tools and instruments, Tangier has&#13;
       been able to produce the workforce talent needed by local and incoming companies alike.&#13;
       This has undoubtedly been a critical element in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic success story.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While Tanger-TÃ©touan effectively utilized standard national incentives schemes in its&#13;
investment attraction efforts, there is no firm evidence that MNCsâ&#128;&#153; decisions to locate there&#13;
were primarily motivated by incentives. The above-mentioned industries qualified for standard&#13;
national incentives schemes (including in free zones); the World Bank mission did not find any&#13;
additional subsidies or incentives offered at the local level not available elsewhere in Morocco.&#13;
However, Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s unique geographic advantages, quality infrastructure, the relative abundance&#13;
of industrially-serviced land in the region, and workforce availability and cost likely played the&#13;
determining role in attracting investors to the city and its surrounding region. Incentives may&#13;
have served as deal â&#128;&#156;sweetenersâ&#128;&#157;, but do not appear to have been the key driver of MNCsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
decisions to locate there in the numbers or on the scale that they have.&#13;
&#13;
Since Tanger-Med I began operations in 2007, there has been an upsurge in foreign&#13;
investment into the Tanger-TÃ©touan Region. While as early as the 1990s multinational firms&#13;
had begun looking more closely at northern Morocco as a viable nearshore business location â&#128;&#147;&#13;
very close to Europe, but outside the EU â&#128;&#147; it was the inauguration of the new port of Tanger-&#13;
Med that really opened the floodgates to foreign investment, by enabling much faster, less costly&#13;
market access. In industries ranging from plastics and packaging to metal products and fast&#13;
fashion, the Tangier areaâ&#128;&#153;s bottom-line business advantages became hard for MNCs to ignore.&#13;
Development of a network of industrial free zones in the area, offering one-stop processing,&#13;
fiscal incentives, and efficient logistics services, further solidified Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s value proposition.&#13;
&#13;
The arrival of French automaker Renault to the Tangier area in 2012 provided a&#13;
tremendous boost to Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s FDI attraction efforts, and in particular to development&#13;
plans for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s north. On 280 hectares of land donated by the Moroccan government,&#13;
Renault established what will upon full buildout be the largest automotive plant on the African&#13;
continent, producing some 400,000 vehicles per year. Located in Melloussa, in between the port&#13;
of Tanger-Med and the cities of Tangier and TÃ©touan, the plant offers easy access to all of them&#13;
(and the regionâ&#128;&#153;s vast labor pool) via brand-new multilane highways. A dedicated rail link from&#13;
the Renault plant directly to the new seaport enables easy loading and offloading of automotive&#13;
components and assembled vehicles. At present, entire engines are shipped to the plant via&#13;
Tanger-Med from Renaultâ&#128;&#153;s European plants for installation into locally-assembled vehicles, but&#13;
that is expected to change over the next few years, as more content is sourced locally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                288&#13;
&amp;#12;Renaultâ&#128;&#153;s production plant at Melloussa&#13;
&#13;
The Renault plant is expanding, helping to develop a local supplier base and auto industry&#13;
know-how. The vehicles produced at Melloussa now comprise about 35-40% Moroccan-made&#13;
content, but the plan is to gradually increase that share of local content to 60% or more, as local&#13;
suppliers build up technical capabilities and expand their own productive capacity. In addition,&#13;
so far 12 Tier-1 suppliers from abroad have followed Renault to Morocco, setting up operations&#13;
in proximity to their key customer. Officials interviewed at the Renault plant also hinted at plans&#13;
to establish a sister Nissan plant alongside the existing one at Melloussa, with outward signs&#13;
(Nissan logos) already in place. While Renault already has a leading 40% share of the domestic&#13;
Moroccan auto market (including another JV assembly plant in the Casablanca area), more than&#13;
90% of Renault vehicles produced at Melloussa (mostly under the Logan brand) are destined for&#13;
export through Tanger-Med. With an initial capital investment of US$1.5 billion, Renault&#13;
directly employs 5,500 workers at the site, with another 30,000+ jobs supported indirectly (at&#13;
component suppliers, etc.) through the plantâ&#128;&#153;s multiplier effect in the local economy. In a very&#13;
real sense, this single investment project has helping propel Tangier into FDIâ&#128;&#153;s major league.&#13;
&#13;
Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s quest to become a regional automotive production hub did not begin or end with&#13;
attracting the Renault factory. Even in the early 2000s, foreign automotive firms started to&#13;
produce components in Morocco for installation at European assembly plants. Then, Renaultâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
arrival provided an even more compelling reason to be in Tangier. The regionâ&#128;&#153;s free trade zones&#13;
are home to some leading auto suppliers, among them: electronics maker Delphi Automotive,&#13;
with 4,900 local employees; Lear Automotive, with 2,500 employees; Japanese air conditioning&#13;
maker DENSO Thermal Systems, employing 120 Tangerois; and chemicals giant Dupont,&#13;
supplying paint colors for vehicles, with 25 local employees. The Moroccan government has&#13;
ambitious plans for further auto cluster development, and is actively working to attract a second&#13;
major automakerâ&#128;&#153;s assembly plant to Tanger-TÃ©touan, which would further solidify Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               289&#13;
&amp;#12;status as a leading automotive production hub in its part of the world. To this end, another 300&#13;
hectares have been set aside for a free zone dedicated to the auto industry, called Tangier&#13;
Automotive City (TAC), adjacent to Renaultâ&#128;&#153;s plant at Melloussa. While only one part of TAC is&#13;
operational (the rest is still under construction), there has been strong interest from components&#13;
manufacturers, and a handful of automotive firms (e.g. Spanish firms Turbo Cadiz and Europac,&#13;
and Electrical Components International from the U.S.) have already set up operations there.&#13;
&#13;
Demand for skilled and semi-skilled labor surged with the opening of the Renault plant&#13;
and related facilities; instituting workforce development program(s) that would address&#13;
these needs was absolutely essential. In 2011, a dedicated training institute â&#128;&#147; lâ&#128;&#153;Institut de&#13;
Formation aux MÃ©tiers de lâ&#128;&#153;Industrie Automobile de Tanger Med (IFMIA) â&#128;&#147; was established&#13;
adjacent to the Renault factory then under construction in Melloussa. In line with the approach&#13;
outlined in Emergence212 and funded by Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s national government (specifically, the&#13;
Ministry of Employment and Vocational Training, as well as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and&#13;
New Technologies) in collaboration with the Agence FranÃ§aise de Developpement (AFD) but&#13;
operated by Renault, IFMIA was established to fill the talent pipeline needed by expanding&#13;
automotive production in the region, for jobs at Renault itself but also at the facilities of its&#13;
components suppliers. Specific applied skills taught include stamping, welding, riveting,&#13;
assembly, hydraulics, pneumatics, electrics, materials handling, servo systems, mechanics,&#13;
robotics, forklift operations, sanding, painting, logistics, and so on. The skills attained through&#13;
this training program are also applicable to related industries like aerospace, whose skills needs&#13;
are somewhat comparable in functional terms. On the whole, this program has been a stellar&#13;
success, and is indicative of the kinds of vocational and customized training programs which&#13;
Tangier (and more generally, Morocco) have utilized to ensure the availability of skills sets&#13;
critical for industrial development. It is another important factor in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s recent success.&#13;
&#13;
The relocation of Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s freight traffic to the new Tanger-Med port has enabled the&#13;
redevelopment of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s old seaport, renamed Tanger-Ville, into a tourism- and fishing-&#13;
focused maritime facility, along with high-end retail, entertainment, and residential&#13;
developments. To coordinate these activities, a dedicated organization called SAPT (SociÃ©tÃ©&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;AmÃ©nagement pour la Reconversion de la Zone Portuaire de Tanger) was established in 2010.&#13;
The free trade zone previously located inside the port area was decommissioned, its businesses&#13;
relocated to a new area outside the city core, while a wall cordoning off the port from its city was&#13;
torn down. Implemented in several phases, the portâ&#128;&#153;s multifaceted conversion process is still&#13;
ongoing. A new harbor for fishing vessels is being constructed outside the old port area, which&#13;
will enable fish processing facilities to be relocated away from the portâ&#128;&#153;s main tourist areas. At&#13;
present, new terminals for larger cruise ships and pleasure craft are also under construction,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;which will be followed by the construction of upscale housing, office space, three hotels, a&#13;
convention center, a retail complex with cinemas, and eventually even a hanging cable car&#13;
system (tÃ©lÃ©fÃ©rique) which will transport visitors and other passengers between this new leisure&#13;
port and tourist attractions in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s old Medina. Much of this development will be funded by&#13;
private concessionaires or public-private partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier has worked hard to reconcile its dual (and sometimes seemingly contradictory)&#13;
ambitions to simultaneously serve as a manufacturing hub as well as a leading tourist&#13;
destination. This was achieved through extensive stakeholder consultation and visionary&#13;
transportation planning, by measures that included the above-mentioned port redevelopment,&#13;
relocating manufacturing firms outside the city core to newly-built, designated facilities with&#13;
adequate infrastructure, designating prime locations as â&#128;&#156;touristâ&#128;&#157; zones while reserving the&#13;
flexibility to rezone areas as needed, and inviting/encouraging foreign investment in both&#13;
industrial plants and the tourism sector. After decades of neglect and uncontrolled urban sprawl,&#13;
special attention was paid to environmental protection and mobility. Tangier has been, for&#13;
example, the first Moroccan city to achieve 100% coverage of urban households with vital&#13;
municipal services like water and sewerage, according to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s current Mayor.213 Priorities&#13;
such as environmentally sustainable development, flood control, the preservation of green&#13;
spaces, beach and seawater cleanliness, transportation access (including public transit), and the&#13;
deployment of renewable energy are all seen by local leaders as critical economic development&#13;
issues (for tourism as well as investment attraction), not just citizensâ&#128;&#153; quality of life concerns.&#13;
&#13;
These proactive â&#128;&#156;place-makingâ&#128;&#157; initiatives set the stage for Tangier to be more than a&#13;
transfer hub for tourists traveling between Spain and Morocco. In addition to having the&#13;
nationâ&#128;&#153;s fourth busiest passenger airport at Ibn Battouta, Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s twin maritime passenger&#13;
gateways (Tanger-Med and the old port at Tangier-Ville) account for about one fifth of all tourist&#13;
arrivals to Morocco, or close to two million visitors per year. This presented a clear opportunity&#13;
to try to get them to spend some more time in the city and its environs, rather than just pass&#13;
through. But a systematic, focused approach to promoting tourism in the region was needed.&#13;
With the involvement of both local and national actors, such an approach was indeed developed.&#13;
&#13;
Tanger-TÃ©touanâ&#128;&#153;s tourism promotion efforts have been closely tied in with Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
nationwide tourism sector strategies. The national Vision 2010 and Vision 2020 planning&#13;
documents described earlier were developed collaboratively, in a process involving the&#13;
Moroccan government, CNT, the 16 Regional Tourism Councils, private-sector firms, and&#13;
stakeholders at large. In addition to boosting the numbers of visitors to the country, a key&#13;
objective has been to develop Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s tourism brand beyond just Marrakech, which had&#13;

&amp;#12;already become globally known for its cultural treasures. The Vision documents sought to ensure&#13;
the balanced growth of tourism across Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s regions, while also emphasizing its economic&#13;
and environmental sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
The regional plan for Tanger-TÃ©touan took inventory of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s tourism assets, and&#13;
identified priority areas for development. Tangier-TÃ©touan is generally greener than much of&#13;
North Africa, and its pleasant climate is reminiscent of coastal Californiaâ&#128;&#153;s, without extremes of&#13;
heat or cold. With literally millennia of recorded history and the sites to document it, Tangier is a&#13;
cultural gem. Local authorities are working to further increase the areaâ&#128;&#153;s attractiveness to visitors&#13;
both by emphasizing its natural beauty and ecotourism potential, and by developing large-scale&#13;
tourist resorts and attractions. The current hotel capacity in Tangier-TÃ©touan exceeds 13,000&#13;
beds, but plans are afoot to more than triple this to 40,000 beds by 2020. Indeed, the regionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
existing hospitality infrastructure has seen dramatic growth over the past few years, with many&#13;
international hotel chains moving in. It is planned that the city of Tangier itself will be the&#13;
locomotive driving the development of the whole regionâ&#128;&#153;s tourism industry, building on its&#13;
transport advantages as well as its lure as a cultural destination, centered on its historic Medina.&#13;
With about a million nights spent by tourists in Tangier hotels each year, the city now ranks as&#13;
the fourth most-visited Moroccan city after Marrakech, Agadir, and Casablanca.&#13;

&amp;#12;Key Local Actor&#13;
&#13;
Tangier does not have a single, focal economic development organization, but several&#13;
entities from both the public and private sectors do have a role in fostering economic&#13;
growth and job creation in the city and its surrounding region of Tanger-TÃ©touan. These&#13;
include: the regional governorate (Wilaya), which has a coordinating and oversight role over the&#13;
work of most other public entities in the region; the central and regional/local offices of national&#13;
agencies (e.g. for workforce development, tourism, territorial development, etc.); the Urban&#13;
Community (i.e. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s elected city government); the Agency for the Promotion and&#13;
Development of the North (APDN); the Regional Investment Center (CRI); TMSA; the Port&#13;
Redevelopment Agency (SAPT); institutions of higher learning, especially Abdelmalek EssaÃ¢di&#13;
University; the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM); the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce, Industry and Services (CCIS); the Tangier Industrial Zone Association (AZIT); and&#13;
various other private-sector groups and industry associations.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier and its region have what in practice amounts to a regional growth coalition, even if&#13;
that coalitionâ&#128;&#153;s structure and inter-institutional relationships are not always formalized, or&#13;
codified in legislation. The key actors confer with each other regularly, and act in concert to&#13;
advance the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development agenda. Thus, in a very tangible sense, the above&#13;
entities form a de-facto regional growth coalition, even if the exact mechanisms for its activities&#13;
are not necessarily formalized. With about a million inhabitants, Tangier is not a huge city, and&#13;
even its surrounding region has not much over three million residents. Practically all key&#13;
decision-makers know each other personally and interact on a regular basis. Issues are discussed&#13;
and sometimes vigorously debated within these meetings. There isnâ&#128;&#153;t a formal mechanism for&#13;
resolving differences, but in practice consensus is usually reached on most important matters,&#13;
and problems that cannot be solved locally are brought to the attention of national authorities. On&#13;
the whole, there appears to be a very high level of social capital, resulting less from a sense of&#13;
shared identity than the awareness that these initiatives are essential for Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s future, and the&#13;
conscious efforts of Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s key players to build up mutual trust and work together for results.&#13;
&#13;
Local government and business leaders in Tangier are forward-looking and globally savvy.&#13;
Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s leaders â&#128;&#147; from the Wilaya and the Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s office, to TMSA and CGEM â&#128;&#147; appear to&#13;
have their finger on the pulse of global business in a much more direct way than in many other&#13;
comparably-sized cities. Tangier is not New York or Singapore, but its business and political&#13;
leaders are engaged in promoting their cityâ&#128;&#153;s development and global commerce in very hands-&#13;
on, practical ways, from the identification and targeting of potential investors to taking part in&#13;
trade and investment promotion missions. There is also an almost limitless readiness to listen to&#13;
and address the concerns of investors â&#128;&#147; a â&#128;&#156;can doâ&#128;&#157; spirit â&#128;&#147; whish ensures that Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
environment is a hospitable one, going beyond just what is provided for by national legislation&#13;
and available incentives schemes. The analytics local teams employ are robust, systematic, and&#13;
                                                                                                 293&#13;
&amp;#12;timely. Going beyond a general (and highly generic) â&#128;&#156;open for businessâ&#128;&#157; marketing message,&#13;
which almost every city and country strives to put out nowadays, Tangier focuses on setting&#13;
realistic, attainable goals, and tries to get all of its key actors on board to make it happen.&#13;
&#13;
Below is a closer look at some individual entities with a role in Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
Wilaya of Tangier (Regional Governorate): The Regional Governorate is headed by the Wali&#13;
(Governor), as the personal representative of the Moroccan King in the Tanger-TÃ©touan Region.&#13;
In this role, the Waliâ&#128;&#153;s office oversees and coordinates the work of all public-sector entities&#13;
under its jurisdiction. Ongoing administrative reforms in Morocco are striving to devolve more&#13;
institutional scope to the individual regions, in this case meaning to the Wilaya, to undertake&#13;
interventions of a local and regional significance. Importantly, high institutional capacity within&#13;
the Waliâ&#128;&#153;s office itself (in terms of human resources, technical know-how, and capability to&#13;
implement complex projects), has been a vital enabler of the transformative events and economic&#13;
outcomes observed in recent years.214 The Wilaya is institutionally represented on the governing&#13;
bodies of many other local public entities, and gets a say in their general priorities and spending&#13;
decisions. By law, the Wali is also simultaneously the Prefect of the Tanger-Assilah Prefecture&#13;
within the region, the vast majority of whose population resides within the city of Tangier itself.&#13;
&#13;
Urban Community of Tangier: The Urban Community is Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s city government, headed&#13;
by an elected Mayor and City Council. Its administrative remit does not extend beyond the&#13;
Tangier city limits, but because of the urban coreâ&#128;&#153;s role as the business hub of the entire region,&#13;
it has a greater economic significance than its limited territorial jurisdiction would imply. Within&#13;
the 1,195 kmÂ² encompassed by Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s city limits, there were 974,000 residents in 2014,&#13;
making Tangier Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s third most populous city after Casablanca and FÃ¨s.215 The city&#13;
government has statutory responsibility for the provision of regular municipal services as well as&#13;
for urban planning, as required by national law. It is not administratively tasked with â&#128;&#156;coreâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
economic development functions like job creation, simply with creating an enabling environment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
214&#13;
   For example, in meeting with Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s incumbent Wali, Mr. Mohamed El Yaacoubi, it was very apparent to the&#13;
Bank mission that this was not just a routine administrator who ensures that the apparatus of government is&#13;
humming along as usual. Rather, the Wali takes a keen personal interest in the intricacies of economic development,&#13;
including engineering solutions to transport and mobility challenges, the relocation of specific facilities to ensure&#13;
compliance with environmental safeguards, catering to the locational needs of foreign investors, capitalizing on&#13;
broader global business trends to benefit Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economy, and so on. A â&#128;&#156;letâ&#128;&#153;s get it doneâ&#128;&#157; approach seemed to&#13;
permeate the implementation of almost every initiative. While it is hard to judge based on just a few meetings, the&#13;
Wali may well be representative of a new generation of local leadership in Tangier that is dynamic, capable, and&#13;
unequivocally committed to enhancing economic opportunities and the quality of life for area residents.&#13;

      http://www.h24info.ma/maroc/le-surprenant-classement-des-villes-les-plus-peuplees-du-maroc/31608&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                294&#13;
&amp;#12;for it to occur. However, in practice Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s city government takes a much more active role in&#13;
fostering economic development, undertaking a series of highly-beneficial interventions that&#13;
transcend its immediate administrative scope. These include: â&#128;&#156;place-makingâ&#128;&#157; (improvements to&#13;
quality of life, making the city more attractive to residents, visitors, and investors); investment&#13;
promotion events, both inbound and outbound, touting Tangier as an attractive place to do&#13;
business; building sister-city relationships and other forms of international cooperation; and&#13;
working to improve Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s overall business environment, e.g. by simplifying administrative&#13;
procedures and making sure that available infrastructure is adequate for businessesâ&#128;&#153; needs.216&#13;
&#13;
Agency for the Promotion and Development of the North (Agence pour la Promotion et le&#13;
DÃ©veloppement du Nord â&#128;&#147; APDN): APDN is an agency dedicated to the territorial development&#13;
of the northern third of Morocco (there are two sister agencies for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s central and&#13;
southern parts), under the direct authority of the Prime Minister. Covering an area of 35,973 km2&#13;
that extends along more than 100 km of Atlantic coastline and nearly 300 km of Mediterranean&#13;
coastline, the North has about five million inhabitants. APDN oversees the territorial and social&#13;
development of two of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s 16 regions: Tanger-TÃ©touan, and Taza-Al HoceÃ¯ma-Taounate.&#13;
It includes 11 prefectures and provinces (Tanger-Assilah, Fnideq-Mâ&#128;&#153;Diq, TÃ©touan, Fahs Anjra,&#13;
Chefchaouen, Ouezzane, Larache, Al HoceÃ¯ma, Taounate, Guercif, and Taza), which are further&#13;
divided into 29 urban and 216 rural districts. APDN was created in 1996 at the urging of (and&#13;
with assistance from) the European Union, as a regional body to coordinate development&#13;
activities and funding for that part of Morocco, including halting illegal ones (smuggling&#13;
contraband, narcotics, immigration, etc.). APDNâ&#128;&#153;s focus is on five main areas: opening up the&#13;
North to development, education, electricity, water, and health. In addition to channeling funding&#13;
and carrying out or commissioning studies, it assists local communities in preparing their own&#13;
development plans, seeks to address intra-regional disparities and ensure inclusive development,&#13;
and build local capacity for project implementation. APDN is a vital venue for ensuring dialogue&#13;
and collaboration across multiple jurisdictions in northern Morocco, and a key conduit for&#13;
development funding, from Moroccan as well as donor sources.&#13;
&#13;
Regional Investment Center (Centre RÃ©gional des Investissements â&#128;&#147; CRI): CRI facilitates&#13;
foreign investment into Tanger-TÃ©touan Region, registers new companies, and provides&#13;
entrepreneurial assistance to existing firms. It is AMDIâ&#128;&#153;s principal local partner for&#13;
administering national incentives programs, as well as providing traditional site selection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
216&#13;
    Development of the seminal Tanger Metropole plan was led by the city government, for example, in consultation&#13;
with other pertinent government agencies and key stakeholder/civil society groups. It provides an integrated&#13;
approach to infrastructure, environmental conservation, urban regeneration and redevelopment, tourism, education,&#13;
health, sports, and various other local priorities for Tangier, including some that directly pertain to economic&#13;
development and job creation. Enacted in 2013 and with implementation slated to be completed by 2017, however,&#13;
it falls outside the immediate time scope of this case study and will not be examined in detail in this report.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            295&#13;
&amp;#12;services to foreign investors. Just like AMDI nationally, CRI makes sure that certain criteria are&#13;
met in order to qualify for incentives (in terms of capital investment, job creation, and the&#13;
nature/technological level of each proposed investment). CRI provides incentives to companies&#13;
in the manufacturing, services, and tourism sectors, but not in real estate or agriculture (as those&#13;
sectors are aided by the departments housing and agriculture, respectively). In 2013, for&#13;
example, CRI processed about 540 investment projects, a significant increase from the 450&#13;
processed the previous year. Proposed projects are reviewed and approved (or not) in&#13;
consultation with the Tangier City Council and the Waliâ&#128;&#153;s office. CRI also provides investor&#13;
aftercare services, in coordination with AMDI. Significantly, CRI does not engage in investment&#13;
promotion, and is by law precluded from â&#128;&#156;poachingâ&#128;&#157; or diverting investments from other&#13;
Moroccan regions. Finally, CRI is responsible for registering new businesses in Tanger-TÃ©touan,&#13;
and provides financial assistance to existing Moroccan or foreign firms already operating in the&#13;
region seeking to upgrade or expand their production.&#13;
&#13;
Tanger-Med Special Agency (TMSA): The Moroccan government established the Tanger-Med&#13;
Special Agency in 2002, as a dedicated entity to maximize the development impact of its huge&#13;
investment in a new seaport and landside infrastructure. TMSA is an umbrella organization&#13;
bringing together the Tanger-Med Port Authority with an â&#128;&#156;integrated industrial platformâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
consisting of multiple free trade and logistics zones throughout northern Tanger-TÃ©touan Region.&#13;
The intent was to connect Morocco to global value chains, and to create the right conditions for&#13;
international investors to want to locate in Tangier. TMSA represents the Moroccan State in all&#13;
interactions pertaining to the Tanger-Med port and industrial platform, and has sweeping powers&#13;
in key areas such as land acquisition and allocation. With direct access to senior national&#13;
decision-makers in Rabat, TMSA has also served as an important transmission channel for&#13;
articulating local needs to the national government. As a leading regional economic development&#13;
agency, TMSA brings together various actors involved in trade, investment attraction, workforce&#13;
development, and regional decision-making, many of which have representation on TMSAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Board. Given all this, TMSA and its subsidiaries have played a pivotal role in Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
economic success over the past decade.&#13;
&#13;
Tanger-Med Port Authority (TMPA): The Tanger-Med Port Authority (TMPA) is a subsidiary&#13;
of TMSA, responsible for the construction and maintenance of the portâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure,&#13;
development of the broader port complex, and the overall international promotion of Tanger-&#13;
Med. In coordination with TMSA, TMPA also undertakes long-term planning for the portâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
expansion, as well as of its landside access. Tangier is the only major Moroccan port to have its&#13;
own port authority, rather than be managed by the national ports agency, Marsa Maroc.&#13;
Originally much of the portâ&#128;&#153;s traffic consisted of the transshipment of containers, but now the&#13;
export and import of goods from and into Morocco are gaining in importance as a share of the&#13;
portâ&#128;&#153;s total business volume, especially since the opening of Renaultâ&#128;&#153;s factory at Melloussa.&#13;
TMPA strives to ensure the port complexâ&#128;&#153;s seamless operational integration with the other&#13;
                                                                                            296&#13;
&amp;#12;elements of the Tanger-Med industrial platform, a function that will only gain in importance as&#13;
the port expands further to overtake nearby Algeciras, Spain, in total container capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Tanger Free Zone (TFZ): Like TMPA, the Tanger Free Zone Company is a TMSA subsidiary,&#13;
operating the six facilities that make up the Tanger-Med industrial platform, on some 3,000&#13;
hectares of land zoned for industrial use. The company is 51% owned by TMSA, while the&#13;
remaining 49% of its shares are held by institutional investors in the private-sector â&#128;&#147; primarily&#13;
banks, pension funds, and insurance companies, both Moroccan and foreign. The Tangier Free&#13;
Zone (TFZ) itself is just one of the six industrial or free zones in Tanger-TÃ©touan Region&#13;
operated by this holding company. TFZâ&#128;&#153;s creation actually predates the establishment of TMSA&#13;
and the new seaport: the legal framework for a Tanger Free Zone was put in place back in 1995.&#13;
TFZ was officially established in 1999 as a one-stop shop for investors, and welcomed its first&#13;
industrial tenant in 2000. TFZ offers a range of incentives and fiscal exemptions typically found&#13;
at zones designated for export-oriented production. Located very close to Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s Ibn Battouta&#13;
Airport, TFZ today employs nearly 50,000 workers at more than 500 companies, which have to&#13;
date invested more than US$2.6 billion into local production facilities. The vast majority of them&#13;
are in four sectors: automotive, aerospace, agribusiness, and textiles (especially fast fashion).&#13;
Officials interviewed at the facility cite its strategic geographic location, quality infrastructure,&#13;
and favorable business environment as the top reasons for TFZâ&#128;&#153;s success to date. Its management&#13;
employs standard economic development research and recruitment techniques to identify&#13;
potential investment leads, and to bring those companies to TFZ to set up or expand operations.&#13;
&#13;
Tangier Industrial Zone Association (Association de la Zone Industrielle de Tanger â&#128;&#147;&#13;
AZIT): Operational since 1990, AZIT is Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s oldest industrial zone, and still one of its&#13;
most successful. Originally set up as a way of coping with the risks of factory facilities being&#13;
located in a floodplain outside the city center, AZITâ&#128;&#153;s role has evolved to include facilities&#13;
management (e.g. utilities, industrial waste collection/disposal, and of course flood control),&#13;
emergency services (health, police, fire protection), human resources (e.g. training for operations&#13;
and maintenance of machines), and advocacy on behalf of industrial firms, often in collaboration&#13;
with CGEM and other partners. Legally, AZIT is a non-profit association in which firms own the&#13;
land, but contribute financially and have differing numbers of votes based on the surface area&#13;
each of them occupies (i.e. smaller firms pay less, larger ones more and get a greater say in&#13;
governance). AZITâ&#128;&#153;s General Assembly meets every year to discuss key issues, and elects its&#13;
governing committee (Bureau) every three years. While there is no formal consultative&#13;
mechanism with government, meetings are held on an ad-hoc basis whenever needed, and&#13;
relations with the Wali and other key officials are very good. In the recent past, AZIT has sought&#13;
and obtained those officialsâ&#128;&#153; help with addressing specific problems like dealing with Customs&#13;
or individual ministries in Rabat. Presently, there are 116 firms operating in AZIT, employing&#13;
approximately 30,000 workers, with a particular concentration in the textile/leather, chemicals,&#13;
agribusiness, optics, and construction materials sectors. The zone is oversubscribed, meaning&#13;
                                                                                                297&#13;
&amp;#12;that more firms would like space there if it were available; however, there is no additional space&#13;
available for further growth.&#13;
&#13;
Port Redevelopment Agency (SociÃ©tÃ© dâ&#128;&#153;AmÃ©nagement pour la Reconversion de la Zone&#13;
Portuaire de Tanger â&#128;&#147; SAPT): Established as a public-private partnership and sister agency to&#13;
TMSA, SAPT serves as the lead entity tasked with the transformation of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s waterfront&#13;
following the relocation of cargo and most passenger ferry services to nearby Tanger-Med.&#13;
SAPTâ&#128;&#153;s Board includes all the main actors involved in this project: the Ministry of Economy and&#13;
Finance, the Hassan II Fund, APDN, the Wilaya, Tangier City Council, and so on. SAPT has a&#13;
contractual relationship with other entities involved in the project (such as road construction&#13;
firms), committing to who will do what by when. As noted earlier, the project to redevelop and&#13;
repurpose the old port in the Bay of Tangiers from an industrial quasi-wasteland into a tourist&#13;
attraction is neither a simple nor inexpensive one, but is now seen by the majority of&#13;
stakeholders as vital to Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic future, and is proceeding ahead of schedule and&#13;
within budget. It entailed moving the companies located in the old free zone at the port to TFZ; a&#13;
special task force was created at SAPT to support those firms in the administrative and logistics&#13;
process. SAPT played a key role in ensuring stakeholder buy-in for the project, particularly from&#13;
some relatively small but socially and politically important constituencies like fishermen. SAPT&#13;
officials cite as the key success factor for their project: â&#128;&#156;Do consultations, make promises, and&#13;
make the promises come true to restore peopleâ&#128;&#153;s confidence in the public officials.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Services (CCIS): In Morocco, chambers are quasi-&#13;
public institutions, funded by a 0.1% â&#128;&#156;professional taxâ&#128;&#157; levied on businesses locally, which is&#13;
then funneled back to Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s CCIS by the national Ministry of Finance. CCIS performs&#13;
multiple functions, some of which are directly related to Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic development:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Promotion of Tangier as a business location, including preparing and disseminating&#13;
       informational materials, organizing events and missions (inbound and outbound),&#13;
       facilitating joint ventures, and fostering other linkages with partner entities abroad.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Entrepreneurial support to Tangier firms, including but not limited to capacity building&#13;
       (for production, exporting, etc.), professional development and training, assistance with&#13;
       administrative procedures and compliance (e.g. business taxes, certificates of origin, etc.).&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Member services, including advocacy and intermediation vis-Ã -vis government agencies,&#13;
       conciliation and arbitration in commercial disputes, and provision of market information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CCIS works very closely with the Wilaya, the Tangier Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s office, and national agencies on&#13;
measures to improve the overall business climate (e.g. by simplifying administrative procedures),&#13;
assist corporate relocations within the region due to changing zoning regulations (e.g. moving&#13;
polluting factories and slaughterhouses outside the urban core and areas designated for tourism&#13;
development), and various other initiatives directly affecting its members.&#13;
                                                                                                298&#13;
&amp;#12;General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (ConfÃ©dÃ©ration GÃ©nÃ©rale des Entreprises&#13;
du Maroc â&#128;&#147; CGEM): CGEM is a nationwide private membership organization dedicated to&#13;
furthering the interests of Moroccan business and creating a prosperous economy through&#13;
private-sector initiative. CGEMâ&#128;&#153;s local chapter, CGEM Nord, covers the regions of Tanger-&#13;
TÃ©touan and Taza-Al HoceÃ¯ma-Taounate, and has approximately 150 members, most of whom&#13;
are in the following sectors: automotive, aerospace, logistics, textiles and leather, and&#13;
agribusiness. In addition to advocating on behalf of business interests and promoting cooperation&#13;
among different entities involved in the regionâ&#128;&#153;s development, CGEM Nord commissions&#13;
specialized studies (e.g. on workforce needs in targeted industries), facilitates the attraction of&#13;
foreign investment, assists local member companies in improving their business processes and&#13;
upgrading technologies, provides input into Maroc Exportâ&#128;&#153;s program design at the national level,&#13;
and organizes seminars and learning events for members (e.g. on economic, social, legal, and tax&#13;
topics). Examples of recent accomplishments include: creation of a â&#128;&#156;Regional Center for the&#13;
Business Environmentâ&#128;&#157; in collaboration with CRI, focused on improving local administrative&#13;
procedures; agreement to keep the port open 24 hours per day; separation of export and import&#13;
flows inside the port; creation of MEADs (magasins et aires de dÃ©douanement), as areas with&#13;
expedited port and customs procedures, reducing goodsâ&#128;&#153; time to market; and enabling Moroccan&#13;
firms to pay each other in dirhams, instead of euros, inside TFZ. CGEM leaders regularly meet&#13;
with the Wali and other public-sector representatives every month. However, there are now&#13;
fewer such meetings than before, indicative of there being fewer problems to jointly address!&#13;
&#13;
Abdelmalek EssaÃ¢di University (UAE): The regionâ&#128;&#153;s only major public university was formed&#13;
in 1989 through the merger or two prior educational facilities in Tangier and TÃ©touan, centered&#13;
on the liberal arts and science &amp; technology. To this day, UAE has had a strong â&#128;&#147; and increasing&#13;
â&#128;&#147; focus on providing â&#128;&#156;professionalâ&#128;&#157; educations which aim to prepare graduates for jobs, rather&#13;
than just advancing knowledge for its own sake. Since the global great recession, Moroccan&#13;
universities as a whole have been moving in this direction, emphasizing tangible skills to&#13;
facilitate graduatesâ&#128;&#153; employability. For example, national legislation has since 2008 mandated&#13;
that IT, foreign language, and entrepreneurship modules be integrated into all university&#13;
programs. Currently UAE has about 60,000 enrolled students, half of whom are in Tanger itself,&#13;
and the remainder in the TÃ©touan area. With more than 800 professors, UAEâ&#128;&#153;s main areas of&#13;
instruction include: science &amp; technology; law &amp; economics; business; engineering; languages;&#13;
and medicine &amp; pharmacology. It is governed by a University Council, consisting of senior&#13;
university faculty (UAE president, deans, professors), the president of the Regional Council of&#13;
Tanger-TÃ©touan, representatives of CGEM and CCIS, seven representatives of â&#128;&#156;productive&#13;
sectorsâ&#128;&#157; (i.e. private for-profit firms), and three other external appointees. Membership of the&#13;
Councilâ&#128;&#153;s thematic working groups is flexible, and varies according to the topic being addressed.&#13;
Crucially, private-sector employers are now able to provide more feedback in curriculum design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               299&#13;
&amp;#12;In terms of â&#128;&#156;coreâ&#128;&#157; economic development activities, UAE is prioritizing ever-closer links with&#13;
private industry and labor market intermediaries like ANAPEC. University-based research and&#13;
technology commercialization are not yet highly developed in Morocco, and the universities&#13;
continue to lack sufficient financial autonomy in this, but there has been gradual progress in&#13;
making commercializing research easier. UAE has 15 patents pending, and hopes to get more&#13;
companies interested in its R&amp;D capabilities. Informally, there already are some relationships&#13;
between university professors and Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s for-profit firms, who occasionally hire the&#13;
university to conduct tests on materials, and similar activities at its research labs. UAE leadership&#13;
envisage an increasing role for it in Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s industry cluster development, closely aligned with&#13;
Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s national cluster development strategies. Already, the university is home to four&#13;
â&#128;&#156;competency centersâ&#128;&#157; (i.e. centers of excellence) directly relevant to those clusters: renewable&#13;
energy, electronics and telecommunications, marine sciences, and logistics. All of them provide&#13;
strong impetus to the development of specialized know-how in the region, and clearly aid&#13;
targeted cluster growth. UAE has a technology incubator in TÃ©touan (though not yet one in&#13;
Tangier), as well as a womenâ&#128;&#153;s business incubator, created in 2013 in partnership with AFEM&#13;
(the Moroccan association of women business leaders), which is already yielding results in terms&#13;
of building entrepreneurial capacity and creating employment opportunities. Finally, the&#13;
university has enthusiastically embraced internationalization, adopting the EUâ&#128;&#153;s Bologna degree&#13;
system, and participating in the Erasmus and Tempus programs. It has partnerships with&#13;
educational institutions in many different countries, and its faculty speak multiple languages.&#13;

                                                                                                 300&#13;
&amp;#12;Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Factors of Competitiveness&#13;
&#13;
Factor 1: Conducive national policy context and support mechanisms: The broader&#13;
Moroccan economy has made tremendous strides over the past few years, including substantive&#13;
measures to liberalize the economy, remove barriers to external trade and investment, and enable&#13;
Moroccan firmsâ&#128;&#153; closer integration into global supply chains. Specifically:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Macroeconomic stability and performance, with fairly consistent national GDP&#13;
          growth, exchange rate and price stability, formal job creation, and poverty reduction.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ General business climate improvements, reflected in Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s steadily improving&#13;
          performance in annual Doing Business and similar rankings.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Opening up various sectors of the economy to competition and market dynamics,&#13;
          including privatizing some large previously state-owned monopolies.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Greater openness to the world economy, including through numerous bilateral and&#13;
          multilateral free trade treaties and open skies agreements, and the attraction of FDI&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Some devolution of decision-making for economic development to the regional and&#13;
          local levels, and the instituting of effective feedback mechanisms for alerting&#13;
          national decision-makers to local issues and needs.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ National sectoral development policies, putting in place incentives and mechanisms&#13;
          to promote the rapid growth of industries targeted for proactive economic&#13;
          development efforts. Although these policies were national in scope, their practical&#13;
          operationalization has strong geographic implications.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Instituting highly effective national support tools (e.g. investment incentives,&#13;
          workforce training programs, export assistance) available to firms at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 2: Strategic national focus on northern Morocco: Besides nationwide policies to&#13;
improve the business climate, prioritize specific industry sectors, and accelerate economic&#13;
growth, the Moroccan government has made development of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s northern areas a key&#13;
priority. Examples include:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Unprecedented investment in physical infrastructure to better integrate the north&#13;
           with the rest of the country, and to facilitate international commerce and travel.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Responsiveness to local needs and concerns, articulated through multiple public-&#13;
           and private-sector channels.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Funding a variety of local initiatives, from the environmental cleanup and urban&#13;
           redevelopment to the restauration of historic sites and cultural events.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Marketing and promotion of northern Morocco as a business location and tourist&#13;
           destination, particularly in EU countries.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Attraction of catalyst investments, such as the Renault plant just outside Tangier,&#13;
           including the active participation of all national actors in making it happen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            301&#13;
&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   Encouragement of cross-border cooperation between Moroccan cities/regions and&#13;
       those just across the Strait in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 3: Significant local capacity to further the cityâ&#128;&#153;s and regionâ&#128;&#153;s economic&#13;
development, including:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   High levels of stakeholder engagement through consultation, participation, and&#13;
       building up of social capital and trust as enablers of results on the ground.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Proven ability of various local actors (city, region, private sector, university) and the&#13;
       local representatives of national entities to work together to set and achieve shared&#13;
       goals.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Ability and willingness to articulate Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s needs to national decision-makers,&#13;
       and to advocate on behalf of the city.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Skillfully taking advantage of national initiatives to foster local job creation.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Making good use of national support mechanisms, such as financial incentives,&#13;
       export assistance, and workforce development and training programs.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Capitalizing on external growth opportunities and global trends to attract trade and&#13;
       investment.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Knowledge of products, markets, and â&#128;&#156;how business is doneâ&#128;&#157; worldwide.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Flexibility and responsiveness to investorsâ&#128;&#153; needs, including a demonstrated&#13;
       readiness to engage with them to address their specific concerns.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Proactive initiation of global ties, and use of internationalization as a deliberate&#13;
       economic development strategy (inbound and outbound missions, cultural exchange,&#13;
       language instruction, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factor 4: Geographic, historical, and cultural advantages, which have greatly facilitated&#13;
Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s recent economic success:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s strategic geographic location at the crossroads of major global shipping&#13;
       routes, and its proximity to business partners and markets in the European Union.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   A highly attractive geographic setting (mountains, beaches, pristine ecosystems,&#13;
       temperate Mediterranean climate).&#13;
   â&#128;¢   A rich cultural heritage favoring the development of tourism.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Place-making: targeted efforts to improve the cityâ&#128;&#153;s livability for residents and&#13;
       attractiveness to visitors and investors.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s history and tradition of multiculturalism, diversity, tolerance, and&#13;
       multilingualism: in part due to its long history of global engagement, Tangier has a&#13;
       reputation as an exceptionally open-minded place. Local residents are able to function&#13;
       in multiple languages, and making conscious efforts to learn additional ones.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Political stability and security: Morocco is an oasis of stability in a sometimes&#13;
       turbulent region, and Tangier is safer than many comparably-sized cities. Foreigners&#13;
       are made to feel welcome.&#13;
                                                                                         302&#13;
&amp;#12;Factor 5: A relatively diversified economic base: Even before the national government&#13;
initiated the massive infrastructure investments which would end up having a truly&#13;
transformative effect, Tangier already had a fairly diversified metropolitan economy, albeit&#13;
with a strong manufacturing focus. Local production spanned sectors as varied as machinery,&#13;
metal works, chemicals, apparel and leather goods, handcrafts, and food processing, plus&#13;
fishing and some tourism. Construction and real estate have also traditionally been important&#13;
in this coastal city. All this meant that Tanger companies had at least a basic level of&#13;
manufacturing know-how to later become suppliers to major foreign investors like Renault.&#13;
The new opportunities brought about by the completion of the port of Tanger-Med enabled&#13;
local firms to become better integrated into global value chains, upgrading their technologies&#13;
and workforce skills. Significantly, this process enabled growth in new, higher value-added&#13;
industry segments like automotive and aerospace, gradually transforming the sectoral mix of&#13;
local manufacturing firms.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 6: Workforce skills and talent formation: Having workers with the appropriate&#13;
skills sets, or the ability to quickly attain them, has been an important factor in Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
ability to attract outside firms, particularly foreign ones. Two elements stand out in&#13;
particular:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Generally adequate levels of human capital at highly competitive wage levels across&#13;
       a range of industries (automotive and aerospace components, garments, medical&#13;
       supplies, construction materials).&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Successful labor market intermediation through the national workforce agency&#13;
       ANAPEC, and its highly effective collaboration with employers, the local university,&#13;
       and training providers (e.g. OFPPT) to design, fund, and implement both general and&#13;
       customized workforce training programs.&#13;
&#13;
Factor 7: Bottom-line business advantages: Besides competitive wage levels, Morocco in&#13;
general and Tangier in particular offer some compelling locational advantages to firms in&#13;
several industries. The overall cost of doing business is highly competitive, and the business&#13;
climate much improved in recent years, in everything from tax treatment to regulation. There&#13;
is ample availability of industrially-serviced land, allocated either for free, or on highly&#13;
favorable terms. Power (including from renewable sources) is abundant, logistics capabilities&#13;
have dramatically improved, and Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s free trade agreements with many countries&#13;
enable duty-free market access. While wage levels are higher than in â&#128;&#156;low-costâ&#128;&#157; producers&#13;
like Vietnam or Bangladesh, the technological sophistication of local firms and the quality of&#13;
Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s workforce make it a logical nearshoring location for European markets in&#13;
particular. Given its location right across the Strait from Europe, Tangier has been able to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          303&#13;
&amp;#12;      attract firms needing quick turnaround times, either as direct investors, or in supplier&#13;
      relationships.217&#13;
&#13;
Lessons for Other Cities&#13;
&#13;
Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic success has been enabled by favorable external developments, especially the&#13;
Moroccan governmentâ&#128;&#153;s decision to prioritize the development of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s northern regions.&#13;
Yet local actors skillfully seized the opportunities this offered, improving both the quantity and&#13;
quality of economic growth. While some aspects of Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s experience are quite unique, it&#13;
does still hold some â&#128;&#156;teachable momentsâ&#128;&#157; for other cities. Key learnings include:&#13;
&#13;
      1. Recognize a unique major opportunity when it presents itself, and take advantage of&#13;
         it: This may sound like an obvious thing to do, but recent economic development history&#13;
         is littered with examples of once-in-a-lifetime opportunities which were squandered due&#13;
         to unrealistic expectations, failure to take appropriate actions or follow through, and not&#13;
         seizing the initiative under highly favorable circumstances. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s leaders correctly&#13;
         understood that the establishment of the Port of Tanger-Med and the massive investments&#13;
         accompanying it would offer a unique chance to put the city on the map of international&#13;
         business in previously unimaginable ways, and in the process to remake the cityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
         economy and greatly enhance its residentsâ&#128;&#153; prosperity. Operational plans were made and&#13;
         adhered to, partnerships forged, mutual suspicions and egos set aside, and an inordinate&#13;
         amount of effort put into jointly promoting the city as a business and tourist destination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      2. Follow global business trends, understand their local implications, prioritize among&#13;
         business prospects, and create a compelling value proposition for each audience:&#13;
         With the advent of Tanger-Med, the city and its leaders could easily have jumped onto&#13;
         any number of fads so common in the world of economic development, chasing after&#13;
         whatever industry or segment may be in vogue at the moment. Instead, by employing&#13;
         robust analytics to identify specific business prospects, then tailoring its marketing&#13;
         message to specific audiences, Tangier has been able to attract the attention of investors&#13;
         and visitors alike. Like Morocco as a whole, Tangier has prioritized sectors where it&#13;
         believes it has a competitive advantage, then sought to attract and help grow firms in&#13;
         those industries. The city and its region have relied on available national support tools,&#13;
         and also enlisted the participation of local government and business leaders to help raise&#13;
         the cityâ&#128;&#153;s international visibility.&#13;
&#13;
      3. Help existing businesses and workers adapt and integrate into the global division of&#13;
         labor and industry value chains, through improved technology and skills: Even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
217&#13;
   In some ways, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s role vis-Ã -vis the EU market resembles that of Mexico relative to the US. Tangier is&#13;
geographically and linguistically perfectly positioned to take advantage of the opportunities this presents.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          304&#13;
&amp;#12;   before Tanger-Med, companies and workers in Tangier had a solid level of industrial&#13;
   know-how, in some ways fairly typical of a middle-income economy. This made them&#13;
   suitable candidates to become suppliers to the multinationals, and to staff their new local&#13;
   factories â&#128;&#147; but with some degree of upgrading of skills and technologies. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   economic development leaders worked with private-sector firms, aided by CGEM and the&#13;
   Chamber, to upgrade local firmsâ&#128;&#153; technological capabilities and industrial processes so&#13;
   they could become Tier-2 and eventually even Tier-1 automotive and aerospace&#13;
   suppliers, for example. Meanwhile, the national workforce agency, ANAPEC, worked&#13;
   with employers to identify specific skills gaps, then establish structured curricula or&#13;
   customized training programs to address them. These and similar interventions have&#13;
   literally brought Tangiers into the global economy.&#13;
&#13;
4. Pursue internationalization as a deliberate economic development strategy: It has&#13;
   become rather fashionable for cities to â&#128;&#156;go internationalâ&#128;&#157;, their mayors globetrotting in&#13;
   search of trade and investment opportunities. But beyond the intercontinental handshakes&#13;
   and gift exchanges, translating such initiatives into tangible commercial partnerships has&#13;
   been quite limited. Tangier has been successful in such endeavors for the following&#13;
   principal reasons:&#13;
       a. A longtime tradition of being an â&#128;&#156;internationalâ&#128;&#157; city, embracing different cultures,&#13;
           languages, and tolerating diversity;&#13;
       b. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s geography at the crossroads of trade routes, making it a natural gateway&#13;
           and commercial entrepÃ´t;&#13;
       c. Infrastructure, both physical (TFZs, seaports, airport, hotels, fiber optics, electric&#13;
           grids, pipelines) and â&#128;&#156;softâ&#128;&#157; (foreign consulates, banks, cultural institutions, human&#13;
           linkages) necessary for international commerce;&#13;
       d. An existing concentration of international companies from various countries;&#13;
       e. A critical mass in some industries (e.g. automotive, aerospace, fast fashion,&#13;
           biomedical equipment, tourism), making it a credible partner for foreign firms;&#13;
       f. Supportive, active local and regional leadership committed to internationalization.&#13;
&#13;
5. Nurture productive public-private dialogue and collaborative relationships between&#13;
   government, academia, and the private sector; to build up mutual trust and&#13;
   willingness to collaborate, go for attainable but visible early wins: This is a perennial&#13;
   theme in local economic development, and can often be THE deciding factor of whether&#13;
   strategies are successfully implemented and results achieved. In Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s case,&#13;
   stakeholder involvement occurred early in the process â&#128;&#147; basically, as the national&#13;
   governmentâ&#128;&#153;s decision to prioritize the Northâ&#128;&#153;s development was rolled out, various local&#13;
   actors from the public and private sector were invited to participate in operationalizing&#13;
   what this means on the ground, identifying the issues that matter most to them and to&#13;
   provide suggestions on addressing them. The business communityâ&#128;&#153;s and citizensâ&#128;&#153; input&#13;
   was solicited, stakeholder buy-in ensured, and relations of trust and collaboration forged.&#13;
   After years of apparent neglect, government leaders were able to establish credibility and&#13;
   gain the trust of small business owners, for example, by addressing some of their most&#13;
   pressing needs like wastewater treatment and adequate electrical capacity. This process&#13;
   was by no means linear or easy. It took much proactive effort on behalf of local&#13;
                                                                                          305&#13;
&amp;#12;government and business leaders in particular to work together for the betterment of their&#13;
community as a whole.&#13;

&amp;#12;Testing of Standardized Research Hypotheses&#13;
&#13;
As noted in the reportâ&#128;&#153;s Introduction, this is the sixth and last in a series of case studies of&#13;
economically successful cities around the world. In order to ensure comparability of â&#128;&#156;teachable&#13;
momentsâ&#128;&#157; across all case studies, a set of standardized research hypotheses was tested in Tangier&#13;
to determine the exact scope for action at the metropolitan level, factors that may have most&#13;
affected how those prerogatives were used, and the extent to which specific interventions (and&#13;
how they were implemented) may have resulted in the economic outcomes observed.&#13;
&#13;
The first hypothesis tested seeks to determine to what extent Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic results were&#13;
attributable to proactively picking sectors to support, the second one looks at the strategic&#13;
planning process itself (if any) and how it may have affected economic growth, and the third one&#13;
looks at the planâ&#128;&#153;s implementation, if applicable.&#13;
&#13;
1. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic success is largely attributable to key national actors having made&#13;
   strategic bets on specific industrial initiatives, and their successful local implementation,&#13;
   rather than just making improvements to Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s general investment climate in order to&#13;
   stimulate economic activity. Ongoing national and local-level improvements to the business&#13;
   climate have facilitated the achievement of superior economic outcomes, but proactive&#13;
   initiatives on the part of the national government have contributed much to Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s success&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; in particular, the construction of a brand new mega-port close to the city, as well as&#13;
   accompanying landside infrastructure and an integrated system of multiple free trade and&#13;
   industrial zones.&#13;
&#13;
   Tangier has benefitted from a favorable and improving national business climate, Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   increasing openness to external trade and investment (particularly through multiple free trade&#13;
   agreements), greater market competition, upgraded municipal infrastructure, improving&#13;
   educational outcomes, and dramatically better transport connections, domestic as well as&#13;
   international. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s regional and municipal governments have coordinated the local&#13;
   implementation of national sector strategies, in collaboration with stakeholder groups like&#13;
   business membership organizations, private-sector partners, and universities, while also&#13;
   ensuring the provision of critical infrastructure and political support for economic&#13;
   development and job creation in particular.&#13;
&#13;
   In Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s case, proactive economic development initiatives clearly and directly&#13;
   contributed to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic success. They were undertaken by an informal coalition of&#13;
   national government, regional/local public agencies, and private-sector actors and their&#13;
   associations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             309&#13;
&amp;#12;   Ingredients of success:&#13;
&#13;
       a. As an economically successful city, Tangier has two dominant themes: (i)&#13;
          leveraging its new port to attract investment and create jobs; and, (ii) the successful&#13;
          implementation and localization of national sector development strategies.&#13;
&#13;
       b. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s proactive economic development efforts have been overwhelmingly&#13;
          focused on growing industries producing tradable goods and services, including&#13;
          auto assembly and automotive parts, aerospace, agribusiness and seafood production,&#13;
          garments and leather, transportation and logistics, and tourism.&#13;
&#13;
       c. In its proactive economic development activities, Tangier has to some extent pursued&#13;
          a three-pronged approach to business development: nurturing the growth of existing&#13;
          firms, fostering the establishment of new start-up companies, and striving to attract&#13;
          new outside investment. Of the three pillars, the attraction of outside investors has&#13;
          been by far the most visible and impactful, followed by assistance to existing local&#13;
          companies to scale up their production, acquire new know-how and upgrade&#13;
          technologies, and to integrate into global supply chains, in particular by becoming&#13;
          suppliers to foreign investors with operations in the city or its immediate&#13;
          surroundings. Formation of new businesses has seen an uptick recently, but remains&#13;
          by far the smallest of the three pillars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. The likely trajectory of Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance was dramatically altered by a&#13;
   single policy intervention, the central governmentâ&#128;&#153;s decision to build a new seaport. The&#13;
   city did not have its own strategic plan for economic development, but key local actors&#13;
   successfully implemented national sector strategies. Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s principal private-sector&#13;
   actors (the Chamber of Commerce, General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises, and&#13;
   industry associations) closely cooperated with government agencies on implementing&#13;
   national economic development plans. Separate planning documents were established for the&#13;
   development of the two regions of northern Morocco covered by APDN, but their scope is&#13;
   broader than just economic development and jobs, and includes broader social development.&#13;
&#13;
   Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s economic development-related activities have included:&#13;
&#13;
   a. Robust analytics to guide national sector strategy formulation, based on realistic&#13;
      assessments of Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s competitive position, and knowledge of global business trends.&#13;
      At the local level, the regionâ&#128;&#153;s main investment promotion entity (TMSA) also used state-&#13;
      of-the art market analyses to identify potential investment leads, market the Tanger-Med&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;integrated industrial platformâ&#128;&#157; to them, and follow up with other site selection services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   b. A structured or formal planning process to:&#13;
        â&#128;¢ identify key economic development issues facing the Tangier-TÃ©touan Region,&#13;
           such as inadequate infrastructure and connectivity, workforce skills gaps, lack of&#13;
                                                                                         310&#13;
&amp;#12;             access to finance, technological obsolescence in certain industry segments, and&#13;
             administrative impediments to business formation and growth. Through regular&#13;
             meetings between the Wilaya, the Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s office, other public agencies, and&#13;
             industry associations and chambers, potential coordination failures were overcome,&#13;
             and stakeholder buy-in for important initiatives ensured.&#13;
         â&#128;¢   identify the cityâ&#128;&#153;s main competitive strengths, such as favorable geographic&#13;
             location, competitive business costs, existing expertise in selected industry&#13;
             segments, political stability and security, and enormous tourism development&#13;
             potential.&#13;
         â&#128;¢   formulate a vision of progress that Tangier can make, including specific measures&#13;
             to address its challenges and to capitalize on its competitive strengths. There are&#13;
             various planning documents at the national level, while the cityâ&#128;&#153;s own vision&#13;
             document, Tanger Metropole, was published in 2013, just outside the time period&#13;
             covered by this case study (2002-2012).&#13;
&#13;
   c. Tanger-TÃ©touan assembled an informal â&#128;&#156;growth coalitionâ&#128;&#157; at the regional level,&#13;
      bringing together representatives of public-sector agencies, private-sector businesses and&#13;
      their membership organizations, Abdelmalek EssaÃ¢di University, fishermenâ&#128;&#153;s groups, and&#13;
      other stakeholders in economic development. There is no overarching institutional&#13;
      mechanism for this engagement, but there are multiple channels for interaction focused&#13;
      on specific issues or sectors (development of workforce skills needed by aerospace firms,&#13;
      or payment in Moroccan dirhams instead of euros within the TFZ, for example). On the&#13;
      whole, there appears to be a strong sense of shared purpose among the Tangerois in&#13;
      wanting to see their city and region advance economically, and their leaders have shown&#13;
      a readiness to advocate on their cityâ&#128;&#153;s behalf both with the national government in Rabat,&#13;
      and on the broader international stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   d. Strategic decision-making and prioritization: At the local level, Tangier did not utilize&#13;
      a structured process for identifying and agreeing on policy priorities, nor for evaluating&#13;
      trade-offs between different public investment alternatives, such as through cost-benefit&#13;
      analyses, with the exception of 2013â&#128;&#153;s plan Tanger Metropole, but even in that case it is&#13;
      limited. The implementation of national sector strategies was discussed locally on an&#13;
      ongoing basis, but without evaluating the relative merits of supporting one sector over&#13;
      another.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. The level of autonomy related to economic development in Tangier (the â&#128;&#156;Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s Wedgeâ&#128;&#157;)&#13;
   was not a significant factor in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s improved economic outcomes. Local government&#13;
   bodies in Morocco have a limited role in undertaking direct interventions aimed at&#13;
   fostering economic growth, although they do play an enabling role through the provision&#13;
   of municipal infrastructure and place-making (improving the quality of life for residents&#13;
   and visitors) , as well as through the Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s role as Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s emissary and cheerleader&#13;
   at international events. The public sector has undertaken proactive interventions to spur&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            311&#13;
&amp;#12;economic development and job creation, but this was mostly done by national agencies and&#13;
their local/regional representatives, coordinated through the Waliâ&#128;&#153;s office.&#13;
&#13;
a. Tangier has multiple entities with economic development responsibilities, but no&#13;
   single dedicated local economic development agency or government department&#13;
   serving as its focal point. In addition to national agencies in Rabat whose actions&#13;
   directly affect Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s development, economic development responsibilities at the local&#13;
   level rest with: the Wilaya (coordination and oversight of all national agenciesâ&#128;&#153; activities&#13;
   within the region); the Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s office (public representation and advocacy, sister city and&#13;
   other international liaisons, provision of municipal infrastructure); APDN (strategic&#13;
   planning, financing, international cooperation); TMSA (investment promotion,&#13;
   management of the mega-port and network of FTZs); SAPT (old port conversion and&#13;
   urban redevelopment); CRI (processing investment projects and administering national&#13;
   entrepreneurial support programs); Abdelmalek EssaÃ¢di University (research, technology&#13;
   development, and talent formation); AZIT, the Chamber, CGEM, and industry&#13;
   associations (articulating private-sector needs and constraints to growth, partnering with&#13;
   national ministries in program implementation); and the Regional Tourism Council&#13;
   (planning and advocating on behalf of the tourism industry, capacity building).&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Low financial and administrative autonomy: Although the Kingdom of&#13;
           Morocco has been gradually moving towards a less centralized administrative and&#13;
           fiscal structure, in comparative terms the country is still characterized by a low&#13;
           level of decentralization of authority from national government to regional bodies&#13;
           or elected municipal entities. National plans call for greater devolution over the&#13;
           next few years.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Funding: Municipalities in Morocco, including those in large urban areas, have&#13;
           relatively low municipal spending ability and limited fiscal powers. Elected&#13;
           officials at the city level do have some institutional scope to make and implement&#13;
           funding decisions, but for larger, more transformative initiatives may in practice&#13;
           need the agreement of the Wali, who is appointed by Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s King.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ A well-defined geographical remit: The Urban Community of Tangier is the&#13;
           primary urban-tier local body in the Tanger-Assilah Prefecture, but it does not&#13;
           have functional authority beyond Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s city limits. The Mayor is popularly&#13;
           elected to a six-year term and is the local governmentâ&#128;&#153;s chief executive. The Wali&#13;
           is simultaneously the Prefect of the Prefecture in which the Wilayaâ&#128;&#153;s seat is&#13;
           located,                in              this              case             Tangier.&#13;
&#13;
b. Efficient internal management: Interview findings suggest a significant level of&#13;
   capacity for the Tangier government, seeming to perform well in its main functional&#13;
   responsibilities. While job creation as such is not a core function of the Urban&#13;
   Community, its leadership and staff have been strongly supportive of all pertinent&#13;
   economic development initiatives, and have gone beyond just what they are legally&#13;
   required to provide. Local governance in Morocco is still evolving, so future years will&#13;
   likely result in expanded scope for economic development interventions at the city level.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Roles: As noted earlier, multiple entities in Tangier have some responsibility for&#13;
           the cityâ&#128;&#153;s and regionâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. While the institutional framework&#13;
                                                                                         312&#13;
&amp;#12;           for economic growth and job creation is quite fragmented, in practice it appears to&#13;
           be working rather well, achieving the main set objectives like attracting outside&#13;
           investors and helping local firmsâ&#128;&#153; growth by integrating into global value chains.&#13;
           One possible explanation for why this is the case could be the existence of a&#13;
           shared awareness among key local decision-makers that these interventions are&#13;
           absolutely critical to developing the city, and pulling large numbers of Tangerois&#13;
           (as well as newcomers) out of poverty. But that may not be the full story.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Enabling environment: Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s Urban Municipality and Wilaya, in&#13;
           collaboration with a range of national and local entities (including private-sector&#13;
           ones), have worked to ensure the availability of critical infrastructure needed by&#13;
           local businesses, and to streamline administrative and bureaucratic procedures.&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Monitoring &amp; evaluation: Sector strategies are developed nationally, and include&#13;
           mechanisms for assessing the progress being made in their implementation. Other&#13;
           plans, such as those prepared by APDN and the new Tanger Metropole, also&#13;
           provide for some tracking of progress being made, though not necessarily in a&#13;
           structured and comprehensive way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
c. Private sector and stakeholder involvement in implementation: Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s recent&#13;
   economic success is largely the result of decisions made in Rabat, and interventions&#13;
   undertaken by the national government and its local representatives. Still, the Wilaya and&#13;
   other public-sector entities have endeavored to include diverse stakeholder groups in&#13;
   operationalizing national strategies at the local level, and especially in devising concrete&#13;
   ways in which to capitalize on the unprecedented opportunities for local and regional&#13;
   economic development presented by investments in physical infrastructure. Details:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Among other channels, public-private dialogue is facilitated by CGEM through its&#13;
          consultative forum called the Competitiveness Commission, which brings&#13;
          together its members with government agencies, meeting about once a month&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Chambers and industry associations actively work to integrate local small and&#13;
          medium-sized businesses into multinationalsâ&#128;&#153; global supply chains.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Senior corporate leaders, both at home-grown firms and those based elsewhere,&#13;
          act as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s public champions and utilize their relationship capital to secure&#13;
          more investment and business opportunities for Tangier.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s private-sector firms actively collaborate with the government and&#13;
          educational institutions to design and implement workforce development&#13;
          programs that correspond to industry needs.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Trade unions do not play a prominent role in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic development,&#13;
          but they are represented in training curriculum development at the national level&#13;
          through OFPPTâ&#128;&#153;s Board.&#13;
      â&#128;¢ There is no formal citywide growth coalition as such, but stakeholders are&#13;
          involved in an iterative dialogue with various tiers of government on an ongoing&#13;
          basis.&#13;
