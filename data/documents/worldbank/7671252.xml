LendingInstrument&#13;
&#13;
The proposed lending instrument is a Financial Intermediary Loan (FIL), using IBRD&#13;
funds, with TSKB and Halkbank as financial intermediaries and implementation&#13;
agencies. The World Bank will enter into two separate lega&#13;
Halkbank. The FIL will be a Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) in Euro&#13;
                   with an embedded conversion option for sw&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
below provides a more detailed description o f the proposed dual currency lendinginstrument.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectDevelopmentObjectiveand Key lndicators&#13;
&#13;
The project's main development objective is to increase Turkish SMEs' access to&#13;
medium term finance. Key proposed indicators to measure project outcomes include (see&#13;
Annex A to this MOP for a complete list):&#13;
    (a) Number o f SMEs and SME portfolios financed under the project;&#13;
    (b) Share ofmedium term-financing (more than 12months) inthe total SME loanportfolio&#13;
        financed under the project;&#13;
    (c) Non-performing loan ratios for the project;&#13;
    (d) Share of credit line disbursed in local currency under the project; and&#13;
    (e) Number o fprovinces with active SME clients financed under the project.&#13;
&#13;
To assess project implementation progress, the World Bank will also monitor the amount o f&#13;
credit disbursed over the originally planned disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the indicators included above and in Annex A to this MOP, the project will&#13;
monitor basic indicators providing an obervien, o f (a) the profile o f SMEs financed under the&#13;
project (e.g., amount o f sales, number o f norkers, economic sector); (b) the lending&#13;
technologies used by TSKB and Halkbank (e.g., use of credit scoring models or the&#13;
information provided by the credit bureau to grant loans to SMEs); and (c) overall increase in&#13;
access to finance for the SME sector in Turkey. These indicators will be monitored for&#13;
analytical purposes only and serve as useful inputs to define policies and projects aimed at&#13;
fbrther improving access to credit for SMEs in Turkey.&#13;

equipment, or civil works) and leases. There will be no sector restrictions. However, a cap o f&#13;
about 30 percent o f the total lending amount will be applied to the tourism sector. SMEs&#13;
operating in the tourism sector include "hotels, motels, resorts, pensions, holiday villages, and&#13;
camping sites." Concerns have been raised that demand from this sector i s high, and the cap&#13;
will ensure sectoral diversification o f the program. The compliance of TSKB and Halkbank&#13;
with the 30 percent cap requirement for the tourism industry will be monitored during project&#13;
supervision on the basis o f a specific financial management report.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               due to its strong branch presence in the targeted region combined&#13;
with its focus on the SME segment and its plans to further grow its SME portfolio. Additional&#13;
criteria for selecting Halkbank were its financial soundness, the recent good performance o f its&#13;
credit portfolio, and the size o f its current credit portfolio in the targeted region, creating&#13;
confidence that the bank will be able to disburse the loans in a sound manner (see Annex G to&#13;

this MOP).' To ensure coverage of the underserved eastern and central regions of the country,&#13;
Halkbank will dedicate at least 25 million to SMEs in those regions. As Mith TSKB for&#13;
Component 1, Halkbank will assume the credit risk for Component 2.&#13;

local currency obligation for the converted portion o f the loans. To re-denominate part of the&#13;
                       RY, the World Bank Treasury executes, with a market counterpart, a Euro-&#13;
                        swap. The World Bank passes to the borrower the terms of the swap it&#13;
                       t transaction. If the maturity o f the conversion is shorter than the maturity&#13;
o f the loan, then at the maturity o f the conversion, the borrower will have the option to roll&#13;
over the conversio               swap market still exists at that time), or to revert the remaining&#13;
obligation to Euros             . Ifthe borrower chooses to roll over the conversion, it will not be&#13;
exposed to currenc               t there will be interest rate risk because the loan will be converted&#13;
at market interest rates at that time. Our su                       ket indicates that, at this point in&#13;
time, it is possible to execute Euro-TRY                             swaps for up to 10 years. For&#13;
conversion o f disbursed amounts to TRY, a minimum amount o f 3 million equivalent will be&#13;
required in order for the World Bank Treasury to enter into a swap with the market counterpart&#13;
to effect the transaction. The conversion date (which is the start o f the conversion period) will&#13;
always fall on the next interest payment date following the execution date o f the conversion&#13;
request. The FSL Conversion Guidelines will apply when requesting, accepting and effecting&#13;
conversions on Fixed-Spread Loans. The guidelines are posted on the World Bank Treasury's&#13;
page at the web address:&#13;
http://treasury.worldbank.org/Services/Financial+Products/Current+Products/Fixed+Spread+L&#13;

Additional information on the structure o f the loan will be included in the Operational&#13;
Manuals o f TSKB and Halkbank.&#13;

Financial Soundness and Risk Exposures&#13;
&#13;
TSKB i s a profitable and solvent bank with a sound liquidity position and moderate&#13;
market risk exposures. It has a large credit portfolio, mostly in foreign currency, exposing&#13;
the bank to indirect exchange rate risk and shocks to the real sector. The risks are&#13;
mitigated by extensive use o f bank guarantees, collateral taking, and lending to firms&#13;
with foreign currency earnings. Onbalance, TSKB is viewed as a sound bank.&#13;
&#13;
TSKB is rated by both Fitch Ratings and Moody's and receives ratings in line with the&#13;
largest and best ratedbanks in the country-see    Tables F.3 and F.4. Strong capitalization,&#13;
improved asset quality and profitability, stable funding, and the bank's niche position as&#13;

the key positives are cited in the ratings. The key risks are related to low fee and&#13;

Solvency. TSKB has increased its capital, which now amounts to US$410 million or 16.7&#13;
percent o f assets, in line with the Turkish banking system. (See Table F.5.) On a risk&#13;
weighted basis, the capital adequacy ratio o f 36.8 is very high, reflecting the frequent use&#13;
o f bank guarantees, which lead to a 20 percent risk weighting o f loans. The bank i s thus&#13;
well capitalized.&#13;

Credit risk and loan portfolio performance. TSKB's loan portfolio is large and amounts&#13;
to US$1,302 million (including USD 173 million in lease receivables), or 53 percent o f&#13;
its assets. It has a low risk profile, as illustrated by the low risk weights applied under the&#13;
regulatory rules (see Figure F.2) with only 36 percent o f loans receiving a 100 percent&#13;
risk weight. The majority o f its loans (52 percent) are to banks or with a bank guarantee,&#13;
which allows the 20 percent risk weight. An additional 11 percent o f its loans are risk&#13;
weighted at 50 percent, reflecting the increasingly popular use o f mortgage collateral.&#13;

The bank's gross N P L ratio, at 2.3 percent, i s below those o f the Turkish banking system&#13;
(see Table F.6) and has been reduced by more than half since 2003. The reduction in&#13;
NPLs reflects mostly collections on existing NPLs, while write offs were about a third of&#13;
collections. Gross additions to NPLs in 2004 and 2005 were just US$2.2 million or less&#13;
than a quarter o f a percent o f net loans. Thus, the performance o f TSKB's loan portfolio&#13;
i s very good. TSKB provisions its NPLs 100 percent reflecting a conservative&#13;
provisioning policy.&#13;

TSKB's outstanding loans are about three quarters in foreign currency. In case of a&#13;
depreciation o f the Turkish Lira, this creates credit risk for the bank as the value o f the&#13;
loan in Lira terms increases. This risk i s mitigated for borrowers that are naturally&#13;
hedged, for instance by being price takers in export markets. However, even exporters are&#13;
not perfectly hedged, collateral value will typically depreciate, and this indirect exposure&#13;
to exchange rate shocks therefore remains a concern. On balance, TSKB's loan portfolio&#13;
has a moderate credit risk profile.&#13;

Profitability. TSKB's profitability i s in line with the Turkish banking system (see Table&#13;
F.7) as well as with international standards, with ROA o f 3.6 percent and ROE of 21.4&#13;
percent. The low operating expenses reflect in part that the bank does not engage in&#13;
costly retail operations and inpart that the bank i s efficiently run.&#13;

Liquidity. Because TSKB does not take deposits, its liability side i s very stable and well&#13;
protected from liquidity shocks, as confirmed by the very high liquid assets/short term&#13;
liabilities ratio in Table F.8. As shown in Table F.2, liabilities are almost entirely&#13;
borrowings, while interbank money market liabilities are small. This leaves TSKB very&#13;
resilient to liquidity shocks.&#13;

Market risk exposures. TSKB's direct market risk exposures are very moderate because&#13;
it does not collect deposits and has a long term hnding base and therefore is able to&#13;
extend medium and long loans without the maturity mismatches that banks normally have&#13;
to carry. Moreover, since its balance sheet i s dominated by foreign currency (see Table&#13;
F.9), the bank is not very exposed to fluctuations in local currency interest rates. TSKB&#13;
has manageable short net foreign position amounting to 2.2 percent o f its capital as of the&#13;
end o f 2005.&#13;

Operational Policy 8.30 (OP 8.30) Considerations&#13;
&#13;
OP 8.30 applies to TSKB for th                                          . Insummary, the conditions are&#13;
viewed as being met for TSKB                                             Regarding the specific issuesunder&#13;
OP 8.30:&#13;
&#13;
(a) Adequate profitability, capital, and portfolio quality, as confirmed by financial&#13;
statements prepared and audited in accordance with accounting and auditing principles&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
TSKB is a well capitalized, profitable bank with a sound loan portfolio. The bank&#13;
prepares financial statements in accordance with Turkish regulations, as well as in&#13;
accordance with IFRS and the statements are viewed as adequate.&#13;
&#13;
(6) Acceptable levels of loan collections&#13;
&#13;
Gross NPL levels are below those o f the Turkish banking sector as a whole, and&#13;
collections on NPLs are strong, while new NPLs are a small fraction o f the bank's loan&#13;
book. Thus, the performance of TSKB's loan portfolio i s very good-see                       also the section&#13;
on credit risk and loan portfolio performance above.&#13;
&#13;
(c) Appropriate capacity, including staffing, for carrying out sub-project appraisal&#13;
(including environmental assessment)andfor supervising sub-project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has extensive and recent experience working with TSKB, and it has&#13;
proven its ability to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(d) Capacity to mobilize domestic resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TSKB is not allowed to collect deposits, and borrows limited amounts in the domestic&#13;
interbank money market through rep0 operations (US$352 million). Most o f its&#13;
borrowings are from foreign banks (US$1,409 million). Rather than an inability to&#13;
mobilize domestic resources, the predominance o f foreign bank liabilities reflects&#13;
TSKB's ability to attract them at more favorable terms.&#13;
&#13;
(e) Adequate managerial autonomy and commercially oriented governance&#13;
&#13;
TSKB is a publicly traded privately owned and profitable bank that makes decisions on a&#13;
commercial basis.&#13;
&#13;
@ Appropriate prudential policies, administrative structure, and businessprocedures&#13;
&#13;
TSKB is subject to bank regulations and follows a prudent approach to risk management.&#13;
IFC recently extended a US$50 million subordinated loan to TSKB confirming that&#13;
institution's trust in TSKB's procedures. A separate assessment o f financial management&#13;
i s being conducted and i s attached in Annex H.&#13;

Overview of Halkbank&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank i s a large deposit-taking state bank primarily serving SME customers&#13;
throughout Turkey. It is the 6thlargest bank inTurkey b y assets and has the fourth largest&#13;
branch network'* (see Table G.1 for key indicators). The bank currently has the Turkish&#13;
Government as its sole shareholder, but the bank i s slated for privatization, and the&#13;
Privatization Administration has hired a financial advisor (investment bank) to bring&#13;
Halkbank to the market. Inpreparation for privatization, the bank has been operationally&#13;
restructured through the closing o f branches and substantial reduction o f staff, while&#13;
expanding its loan portfolio to increase profitability in line with its strategy. In order to&#13;
ensure successfbl privatization and maximize the value to the Government as the bank's&#13;
shares are sold, strategic and operational decisions are increasingly made on a&#13;
commercial basis.&#13;
&#13;
Substantial financial and operational restructuring over the past few years have&#13;
contributed to the bank now being financially sound as well as profitable. Untilrecently,&#13;
the bank had ajoint board o f directors with another major state bank, Ziraat Bank, but in&#13;
preparation for the privatization, Halkbank now has its own board. The board approves&#13;
policies, strategies, and principles for the bank. In line with industry practice, the bank&#13;
has a risk management unit reporting directly to the board. An organizational chart for&#13;
the bank i s included in Figure F.1at the end o fthis Appendix.&#13;

Suitability of Halkbank as Counterpart for Component 2&#13;

 By December2005, Halkbank hadreducedits numberofbranchesto 584 inpart as aresult ofbranch&#13;
consolidation after the merger with Pamukbank.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
its SME business. Halkbank's vision reads, "Becoming the leading SME bank o f the&#13;
country.. .." In fact, Halkbank's portfolio i s already dominated b y commercial credit&#13;
(with a significant share o f SMEs), while the bank extends very little consumer credit (14&#13;
percent o f loans).&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank has a relatively strong presence in the                                     ,where credit&#13;
i s less developed. While the Turkish banking system only has 7.6 percent o f its loan&#13;
portfolio in the targeted regionI3(as defined in Annex E to this MOP), Halkbank has 26&#13;
percent o f its loan portfolio (or US$693 million) in this area.14Details on the loans in the&#13;
two relevant parts o f the country are provided in Table G.2.&#13;

&#13;
Halkbank's participation in the project is thus well aligned with its strategy. Halkbank is&#13;
seeking to strengthen its position as an SME bank by increasing its product range and&#13;
growing its portfolio to that segment. As its large portfolio o f non-tradable investment&#13;
securities mature, the portfolio will shift towards tradable securities and loans. Halkbank&#13;
has the lowest loans-to-deposit ratio in Turkey, at 30 percent, compared to an average&#13;
loans-to-deposit ratio o f 62 percent in the banking system. This suggests that Halkbank&#13;
has a large customer base that is currently not exploited in terms o f extending credit.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Soundness and Risk Exposures&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank is a well-capitalized and profitable bank with relatively small market risk&#13;
exposures. The bank's assets are not very liquid, but the liability side does not appear to&#13;
be risky from a liquidity perspective. The loan portfolio has performed well in the past&#13;
two years, and the bank appears to be run in a sound manner. Table G.3 includes&#13;
Halkbank's financial statements compared with those o f the Turkish banking system. The&#13;
section below includes a detailed evaluation o f Halkbank's financial and operational&#13;
performance.&#13;

Solvency. With a capital adequacy ratio o f 50 percent (see Table G.4), the bank is highly&#13;
solvent when measured against risk-weighted assets. The much lower capital-to-assets&#13;
ratio o f 12percent reflects the bank's large holding o f Government debt securities with 0&#13;
percent risk weighting.&#13;

Credit risk and loan portfolio performance. The bank's gross NPLto-total loans ratio is&#13;
high at 19 percent" (see Table G.5). However, it largely reflects old non-performing&#13;
loans that have been h l l y provisioned for but not written off. Current portfolio&#13;
performance is sound. A substantial portion o f the NPLs are carried over from Emlak&#13;
Bank, which failed during the crisis and was merged with Halkbank. Specific provisions&#13;
are made for 98 percent o f gross NPLs'~,and no loans have been written off in the past&#13;
three years. New non-performing loans (including sub-standard), net o f collections during&#13;
the period 2003 to 2005 amounted to less than 1.5 percent o f the bank's current loan&#13;
portfolio. The recent performance o f Halkbank's loan portfolio is thus sound. Halkbank's&#13;
borrowers are widely dispersed, and concentrations are not a concern. In contrast to&#13;
private banks, Halkbank extends 89 percent o f loans in local currency and therefore does&#13;
not expose itself to indirect currency depreciation risk'7such as i s otherwise common in&#13;
Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15NPL ratio is 14 percentas ofthe endofMarch,2006 inpart as aresult ofimprovedcollectionsand in&#13;
part as aresult ofloan growth.&#13;
l6Halkbank has a policy to provision IO0percent for non-performingloans. The difference between&#13;
provisioninglevels and 100percentreflect loansguaranteedby the TurkishTreasury for which the&#13;
provisioningpolicy doesnot apply.&#13;
17Indirectcurrency depreciationrisk refers to the credit risk associatedwith lendinginforeigncurrency. In&#13;
Lira terms, depreciationwill increase the value ofthe loan, while the borrower's financialsas well as the&#13;

Profitability. The bank i s highly profitable b y both Turkish and international standards,&#13;
with real ROA o f 2.1 and real ROE o f 17.5 (see Table G.6). As the Turkish banking&#13;
market evolves, new sources of profits must be developed. Halkbank's non-marketable&#13;
securities are currently being remunerated above would-be-market prices, and as they&#13;
mature they will be partially replaced with lower yielding assets. Halkbank has a greater&#13;
portion o f its assets invested in Government securities than private Turkish banks, and&#13;
return on this position i s likely to decline in the future. Halkbank's ability to sustain its&#13;
current high level o f profitability will depend on its ability to shift its portfolio in&#13;
response to changing profit opportunities. However, even a lower level o f profitability&#13;
would not endanger Halkbank's financial soundness.&#13;

Liquidity. Halkbank's liquidity ratios are below the rest of the banking system (see Table&#13;
G.7), because 79 percent of its securities are investment securities held to maturity. Most&#13;
o f these are non-tradable Government securities issued to recapitalize the bank after the&#13;
2001 crisis, and as they mature they will be partially replaced by marketable securities,&#13;
thus improving the liquidity of the bank over the medium term. The improved liquidity&#13;
position i s evident from the change between 2004 and 2005. Even in the near term, the&#13;
liquidity position does not appear risky. In part, short term liabilities are only slightly&#13;
higher than short term assets, and in part the bank enjoys an implicit guarantee on its&#13;
liabilities from its Government ownership, thus reducing the risk o f a run on deposits and&#13;
other short term liabilities.&#13;

Market risk exposures. Halkbank's market risk exposures are very moderate. The bank&#13;
maintains almost balanced foreign currency positions both on and off balance sheet (see&#13;
Table G.8).The securities held by Halkbank, although they have long maturities, carry&#13;
little interest rate risk because they are repriced frequently.&#13;

Subsidized Credits&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank extends two types o f subsidized credits, "fund credits" and "cooperative&#13;
credits," that account for 38 percent o f total loans'* (see Table G.9 for an overview of&#13;
loans by type and region). The subsidy elements are fully financed by sponsors outside&#13;
Halkbank, and the subsidized credits are structured in a way that does not distort&#13;
Halkbank's credit decision or interest rate setting for other loans.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Directly subsidized "cooperative credits"&#13;
Cooperative credits are extended to small individual borrowers under credit cooperatives,&#13;
and only borrowers organized under these credit cooperatives are eligible. The borrowers&#13;
are small, and the scheme is akin to microfinance schemes seen in many other places.&#13;
Halkbank receives a 6 percent subsidy from the Government in order to reduce interest&#13;
on the loans. Credit risk is reduced by the joint liability o f the cooperative and the&#13;
borrower. When payment from a borrower i s late, the amount i s charged directly from the&#13;
cooperative's account. This program i s only offered b y Halkbank, and it is expected to be&#13;
phased out over time. The loans are carried on Halkbank's balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Indirectly subsidized `tfund loans"&#13;
Fund loans are financed by below market rate liabilities provided in the form of loans&#13;
from, for instance, Turkish EXIM bank and IFIs including EIB. Halkbank is required to&#13;
lend the finds according to certain criteria, such as location in specific industrial zones or&#13;
to special groups o f borrowers such as SMEs. The proposed World Bank credit line will&#13;
also fall in this category. The loans are priced fairly close to market prices, and Halkbank&#13;
earns a normal spread, carries the credit risk for these loans, and has the loans recorded&#13;
on its balance sheet. Some o f the fund loans are available to other banks in the market,&#13;
including private banks, and Halkbank does not enjoy a favorable position vis-a-vis other&#13;
banks with respect to these loans.&#13;
&#13;
Operational Policy 8.30 (OP 8.30) Considerations&#13;
&#13;
OP 8.30 applies to Halkbank for the proposed operation. In summary, the conditions are&#13;
viewed as being met for Halkbank as an intermediary. Regarding the specific issues for&#13;
financial intermediaries, under OP 8.30:&#13;
&#13;
(a) Adequate profitability, capital, and portfolio qual@, as confirmed by financial&#13;
statements prepared and audited in accordance with accounting and auditing principles&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank i s profitable and well capitalized, and its loan portfolio has performed well&#13;
over the past two years-see       the section on financial soundness and risk exposures.&#13;
Halkbank prepares statements in accordance with regulations, and the statements are&#13;
viewed as adequate.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Acceptable levels of loan collections&#13;
&#13;
Although Halkbank carries a large stock o f old non-performing loans, current loan&#13;
collections are good-see    the section on credit risk and loan portfolio performance under&#13;
the section on financial soundness and risk exposures.&#13;
&#13;
(c) Appropriate capacity, including stafjng, for carrying out sub-project appraisal&#13;
(including environmental assessment) andfor supervising sub-project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
On appropriate capacity, including staffing see also Annex H.&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank has                  nworth of loans to SMEs in&#13;
equaling more                  the amount o f credit allocate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to                under the proposed operation. Some o f Halkbank's current loans are&#13;
ex                 sidies and may therefore not be good indicators&#13;
the market. However, Halkbank still lends US$332 million, or&#13;
allocation, in the targeted region excluding the cooperative loan&#13;
region are small-both    net and gross NPL levels are less in the targeted region than for&#13;
the bank as a whole. Th&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(d) Capacity to mobilize domestic resources&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank has US$12.3 billion worth o f domestic deposits, proving its ability to mobilize&#13;
domestic resources.&#13;
&#13;
(e) Adequate managerial autonomy and commercially oriented governance&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank i s owned by the Government and about to be privatized, possibly through an&#13;
IPO. In case of an IPO, the Government will retain control until a private sector partner&#13;
takes a majority stake in the bank. In preparation for privatization, business objectives&#13;
have shifted to a commercial basis in order to maximize the value of the bank when the&#13;
shares are sold. Since the Government still owns and controls the bank, it is clearly not&#13;
totally autonomous and commercially oriented in its decision making. However, the&#13;
team's assessment indicates that decisions are made sufficiently autonomously and that&#13;
they are commercially oriented, as also evidenced by sound financials o f the bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
flAppropriate  prudential policies, administrativestructure, and businessprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank complies with the regulations, and its balance sheet has a low risk profile.&#13;
Credit decisions are made on a commercial basis (see section on subsidized credits for&#13;
details), and the bank has a risk management unit reporting to the bank's board o f&#13;
directors, according to international practice. Separate procurement and financial&#13;
management assessments are included in&#13;

 management systems at TSKB and Halkbank. The current financial management&#13;
 arrangements for the project are satisfactory at bothbanks. A summary of the conclusions&#13;

Country Issues&#13;
The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) issued a new comprehensive&#13;
regulation on accounting standards for banks in July 2002, which brings these standards&#13;
in line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, the BRSA&#13;
regulation does not require full application o f IFRS 27 (consolidation o f subsidiaries), as&#13;
banks only have to consolidate their financial subsidiaries, while for non-financial&#13;
subsidiaries separate financial statement disclosure i s mandated. The statements o f such&#13;
non-financial subsidiaries are not IFRS-based,20however, and thus their disclosure will&#13;
not allow the user to consolidate these with the IFRS-based consolidated statements of&#13;
the parent bank and its financial subsidiaries. Also, as the IFRS are subject to change, any&#13;
such change will necessitate an adjustment o fthe BRSA regulation.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The BRSA also issues rules governing the external audit o f bank financial statements,&#13;
and only auditors approved by the BRSA may carry out such audits. The "Regulation on&#13;
Principles for Independent Auditing" and the "Regulation on Authorization o f the&#13;
Auditing Institutions and Permanent or Temporary Withdrawal oftheir Authorities," both&#13;
published in the Official Gazette Nr. 24657 on January 31, 2002 are broadly in line with&#13;
ISA.&#13;
&#13;
TSKB and Halkbank have been assessed for compliance with BRSA prudential&#13;
regulations by the project team and found to be in compliance.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementingEntity&#13;
TSKB and Halkbank will each borrow 100 million equivalent under the proposed&#13;
project. Both institutions will act as retailers and lend directly to eligible SMEs. The&#13;
- .&#13;
Treasury will be the guarantor o f the loans.&#13;
&#13;
Assessments for TSKB and Halkbank are available in Annex F and G o f this MOP&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
Compliance with the prudential regulations set out b y Banking Regulatory Supervisory&#13;
Authority (BRSA) is required for the continuing eligibility o f Halkbank            . This&#13;
will be monitored through (a) prudential regulation compliance certificates and (b) annual&#13;
audit reports.&#13;
&#13;
The risk associated with both implementing entities is assessed as negligible.&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
As the project will be implemented by TSKB, which is a private bank, and Halkbank,&#13;
which is a state owned bank with commercially oriented decision making, the only&#13;
requirement is to have the necessary allocations as per their own budgetingprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
The risk associated with the budgeting process is assessedas negligibIe.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting&#13;
The accounting and financial management capacities at both TSKB and Halkbank are&#13;
satisfactory. They both have qualified personnel, adequate manuals and guidelines to&#13;
conduct efficient financial management. The accounting and reporting systems at both&#13;
banks are geared towards producing statements and information as required by Turkish&#13;
laws and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
Considering that both banks have adequate accounting and reporting systems, the main&#13;
transactions, (i.e., movements in the             account, uses from                  will&#13;
be in TSKB's and Halkbank's main                 g systems. The mai                  stem&#13;
will be supported by a sub-system for project reportingpurposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
loans fi-omthe World Bank-EFIL 11, EFlL 111 and the Renewable Energy Loan. TSKB&#13;
has updated the current manual to reflect the changes in the workflow that result from its&#13;
role as a retail bank rather than an APEX bank.&#13;
&#13;
The risk associated with accounting policies and procedures in TSKB is assessed as&#13;
negligible.&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank will be using its own accounting system and accounting&#13;
                  oses. Semi-annual FMRs will be produced by the&#13;
                                  through the use of Excelworksheet&#13;
upon with the Bank. The operations manual for the project will include the work flows&#13;
for the SME project.&#13;
&#13;
The risk associated with accounting policies and procedures in Halkbank is assessed as&#13;
negligible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In order to facilitate prompt disbursements for this operation, TSKB will have two&#13;
designated accounts, one for Euro and the other for USD, and Halkbank will have one&#13;
designated account. The account will be maintained at the institutions themselves under&#13;
terms and conditions acceptable to the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Funds from the TSKB portion o f the loan will be made available to SMEs through the&#13;
usual lending procedures o f TSKB. TSKB will keep the invoices for eligible expenditures&#13;
submitted by the SMEs for investment loans. When working capital loans are extended to&#13;
SMEs, TSKB will obtain and retain financial statements of the SMEs on an annualbasis&#13;
in order to monitor their financial performance. The submission o f invoices for working&#13;
capital loans is not required, but SMEs must keep them for ex-post review.&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank will apply its usual lending procedures for loans from the World Bank. A&#13;
potential beneficiary enterprise will make its application to a Halkbank branch, which&#13;
                                                        RegionaUGeneral Directorate.&#13;
                                                        will collect initial information&#13;
the market and, based on the firm's good standing, will give its report to the branch,&#13;
which in turn will make the evaluation and prepare the loan proposal for the Loans&#13;
Department o f Halkbank. The loan will then be submitted to the General&#13;
ManagedDeputy General Manager, to the Credit Committee, and to Halkbank's Board o f&#13;
Directors. After the approval o f t&#13;
&#13;
                              The branches will be responsible for controlling the already&#13;
                            . They will be checking for mathematical correctness as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
available to the SMEs.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
which they have extended working capital loans every twelve months. A copy o f these&#13;
financial statements w,ill be made available at the head office. The changes in the&#13;
working capital requirements o f the companies m,ill be monitored through these financial&#13;
statements. The submission o f invoices for working capital loans is not required.&#13;
&#13;
The risk associatedwithfundsjow is assessedas negligible.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialReporting&#13;
TSKB and Halkbank will maintain records and will ensure appropriate accounting for the&#13;
hnds provided. The FMRs will be prepared semi-annually and will be submitted to the&#13;
World Bank no later than 45 days after the end o f the period. The formats o f the FMRs&#13;
have been agreed upon with both TSKB and Halkbank.&#13;
&#13;
Reporting will include the number o f employees o f the sub-borrower, its annual turnover,&#13;
the province in which the sub-borrower i s located, and the sector to which the borrower&#13;
belongs.&#13;
&#13;
The loans that will be extended to SMEs will be investment and working capital loans.&#13;
Documentation that i s currently received by both banks for the investment and working&#13;
capital loans from their customers will be relied upon for the purposes o f this project, and&#13;
this information will be submitted to the World Bank on a summary basis as a part of the&#13;
FMRs.&#13;
&#13;
Therisk associatedwith reporting and monitoring is assessedas negligible.&#13;
&#13;
Auditing&#13;
TSKB and Halkbank will prepare separate project financial statements for the portions of&#13;
the project they will implement.&#13;
&#13;
Annual and six-monthly (limited review) audits o f TSKB are undertaken on an&#13;
InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS) basis in accordance with lnternational&#13;
Standards o fAuditing(EA) b y a reputed international auditing firm. The current auditors&#13;
                 loitte and Touche's member firm in Turkey.&#13;
                 were reviewed and all had clean audit opinions. An audit o f the SME&#13;
                 1 statements (project balance sheet, sources and uses o f hnds and&#13;
            account statement) will also be included in the auditors' terms o f reference.&#13;
TSKB has been engaging the services o f international auditors for several years, and the&#13;
engagement of an auditor will therefore not be a specific Board condition.&#13;

&#13;
The risk associatedwith external audit is assessed as negligible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Conversion procedure&#13;
The World Bank's loan to TSKB and Halkbank will start as a Fixed Spread Loan (FSL)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
re-denominate part o f the loan ob                             e World Bank Treasury executes,&#13;
with a market counterpart, a Euro                               swap. The World Bank passes to&#13;
the borrower the terms o f the swap it obtains in its market transaction. If the maturity of&#13;
the conversion i s shorter than the maturity o f the loan, then at the maturity o f the&#13;
conversion, the borrower will have the option to roll over the conversion (                     aP&#13;
market still exists at that time), or to revert the remaining obligation to Euros                If&#13;
the borrower chooses to roll over the conversion, it will not be exposed to currency risk,&#13;
but there will be interest rate risk because the loan will be converted at market interest&#13;
rates at that time. Our survey                        indicates that, at this point in time, it i s&#13;
possible to execute Euro-TRY                           swaps for up to 10 years. For conversion&#13;
o f disbursed amounts to TRY, a minimum amount o f 3 million equivalent will be&#13;
required in order for the World Bank Treasury to enter into a swap with the market&#13;
counterpart to effect the transaction. The Conversion Date (which i s the start of the&#13;
Conversion Period) will always fall on the next Interest Payment Date following the&#13;
Execution Date o f the Conversion Request. The FSL Conversion Guidelines will apply&#13;
when requesting, accepting and effecting conversions on Fixed-Spread Loans. The&#13;
guidelines are posted on the World Bank Treasury's page at the web address:&#13;
http://treasury.worldbank.org/Services/Financial+Products/Current+ProductsiFixed+Spread+Loan+(FSL).h&#13;

Additional information on the structure o f the loan will be included in the Operational&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
As mentioned in the main document and in other sections of this Annex, the proposed&#13;
loan will be allocated under separate loan agreements to TSKB for 100 million&#13;
equivalent (60% in Euros (60,000,000) and 40% in US$ (US$48,056,000) and to&#13;
Hakbank for 100 million, which will be on-lent to SMEs. For Halkbank, the allocation&#13;
of loan proceedsbetween two columns is necessary to record the 50million increase in&#13;
the loan package since the original Board approval of June 8, 2006. A ceiling o f about&#13;
30% of the loan amounts can be allocated to the tourism sector. The two tables below&#13;

C.       Supervision Plan&#13;
&#13;
During project implementation, the World Bank will supervise the project's financial&#13;
management arrangements in two main ways: (i)reviewing the project's semi-annual&#13;
financial management reports as well as the implementing banks' and project's annual&#13;
audited financial statements and auditor's management letter; and (ii) during the World&#13;
Bank's supervision missions, reviewing the project's financial management and&#13;
disbursement arrangements (including a review of a sample of SOEs and movements on&#13;
the designated account) to ensure compliance with the World Bank's minimum&#13;
&#13;
                                            46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
requirements. Spot audits will be carried out on lending limits, SME eligibility criteria as&#13;
outlined in Annex E to this MOP, and on the credit approval process applied for&#13;
individual loans. As required, a World Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist&#13;
will assist inthe supervision process.&#13;

&#13;
A.       General&#13;
&#13;
The procurementfor the proposedproject would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"&#13;
dated May 2004 andprovisions stipulatedin the LoanAgreement. The procurement&#13;
arrangementsare described below.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Goods: Procurement of goods and related services (installation and&#13;
maintenance) financed under the proposed project will be according to the World Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. For contracts below 2.5 million equivalent, established local&#13;
private sector commercial practices will be followed in accordance with paragraph 3.12&#13;
o f the Procurement Guidelines. Care has to be taken o f other relevant factors such as time&#13;
o f delivery, efficiency and reliability o f the goods, availability o f maintenance facilities&#13;
and spare parts thereof, and in case of non-consultant services, o f the quality and&#13;
competence o f the parties rendering them. Advertising in the local and internationalpress&#13;
will not be mandatory. However, International Competitive Bidding (ICB) may be the&#13;
most appropriate procurement method for the purchase o f large single items. The&#13;
procurement o f goods and related services under all ICB contracts will be subject to the&#13;
World Bank's prior review. Contracts placed by sub-borrowers on their subsidiary or&#13;
affiliated companies will not be eligible for financing out o f the loan. The procurement of&#13;
second handgoods i s not eligible for financing out o f the loan.&#13;
&#13;
Procurementof Works:Procurement of works financed under the proposed project will&#13;
be according to the World Bank Procurement Guidelines. For civil works estimated to&#13;
cost less than 2.5 million equivalent per contract, established local private sector&#13;
commercial practices will be followed in accordance with paragraph 3.12 o f the&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. Contracts placed by sub-borrowers on their subsidiary or&#13;
affiliated companies will not be eligible for financing out o f the loan.&#13;

                                                                          pecified below are&#13;

            the records o f the procurements handled through&#13;
           respectively. The documents related to the working capital expenditures will be&#13;
kept by the SMEs, and these documents will be provided to the Bank whenever&#13;
requested. The World Bank will conduct regular post reviews o f the sub-projects not&#13;
&#13;
                                             48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
requiring a prior review. The PIUSwill be re&#13;
related to specific procurement transactions&#13;
order to facilitate the Bank's reviews.&#13;
&#13;
TSKB was responsible for the implementation o f the similar EFIL-I and EFIL-I1projects,&#13;
and no procurement problem was encountered in these projects. The EFIL-111project was&#13;
approved by the Bank's Board in FY06. An assessment o f the capacity o f TSKB to&#13;
implement procurement actions for the project was carried out by the procurement&#13;
specialist on March 22, 2005. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for&#13;
implementing the project and the interaction among the project staff responsible for the&#13;
procurement activities. The overall project risk for procurement is low.&#13;
&#13;
Halkbank i s a public Bank and has implemented two World Bank financed loans in the&#13;
past: the Second Small and Medium Scale Industry Project (L3067) and the Agro&#13;
Industry Project (L3077). Halkbank has very wide experience in similar transactions as&#13;
the principal objective o f its establishment. An assessment o f the procurement capacity of&#13;
Halkbank was carried out by the Salih Kemal Kalyoncu on July 18, 2005. The overall&#13;
risk for procurement is average.&#13;
&#13;
Private Sector Procurement Practice in Turkey: In the Country Procurement&#13;
Assessment Report dated June 2001, it was determined that there are well established&#13;
commercial practices for the procurement o f goods, works and services by private sector&#13;
enterprises, autonomous commercial enterprises and individuals. In case o f goods, the&#13;
local practice is to prepare the technical specifications and solicit quotations from the&#13;
local and/or international market. In case o f medium and large works, the technical&#13;
specifications are usually prepared by consulting companies, and bids are collected from&#13;
qualified contractors. Minor works are generally tendered on a lump sum basis by&#13;
collecting bids from a number o f local contractors. When equipment and machinery i s&#13;
needed for expansion o f existing facilities, the purchasers usually prefer proprietary&#13;
goods from a single source for the sake o f standardization and minimization o f&#13;
operational and maintenance costs. Therefore, local private sector or commercial&#13;
practices can be considered to be consistent with the World Bank's criteria with respect&#13;
to economy and efficiency. The general rule in the sector i s to procure the least cost&#13;
goods, works and services consistent with minimumquality requirements.&#13;
&#13;
All SMEs financed under this loan should have private ownership.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Procurement Plan and General Procurement Notice&#13;
&#13;
At the appraisal stage or during the implementation o f the project, it is not possible to&#13;
estimate either the sub-borrowers or their procurement requirements. Therefore, it i s not&#13;
possible for the borrower to develop a Procurement Plan which provides the basis for the&#13;
procurement methods. Similarly, since the contract sizes and the methods cannot be&#13;
estimated, it i s not possible to prepare and publish a General Procurement Notice. It i s&#13;
expected that each sub-borrower will provide a list o f procurements planned under the&#13;
sub-loan. In case any sub-project includes ICB, a special procurement notice will be&#13;
published in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines.&#13;

For sub-projects that do not require an EIA,                                       , in&#13;
cooperation with the sub-project sponsor, will prepare an environmental screening form&#13;
to define the environmental issues associated with the sub-project and how they will be&#13;
mitigated and monitored. The sub-borrower will also be responsible for ensuring that all&#13;

procedures and, if appropriate, examine selected sub-projects at their discretion.&#13;
&#13;
For sub-projects that do require an EIA, the sub-project sponsor would be required to&#13;

                            Assessment Positive Decision), (b) the MoEF approved EIA&#13;
together with an Addendum that would include any supplemental information required by&#13;
World Bank for "Category A" EIA projects. The EIA and "World Bank Addendum"&#13;
would be reviewed and approved by the World Bank, and disclosed in Turke&#13;
language version) and the World Bank InfoShop (English language version).&#13;
Halkbank branches would not be permitted to continue processing the sub-project until&#13;
World Bank approval of the EIA and Addendum is offered and disclosure in Turkey and&#13;
the World Bank InfoShop has been completed. The World Bank will have the authority to&#13;
review and post review all sub-projects. The review o f evaluations will ensure that:&#13;
screening was performed consistently and accurately, the work was o f satisfactory&#13;
quality, recommendations specified b y the granting o f the approvals were followed, all&#13;
documentation was properly filed and recorded, and the conditions o f approval b y the&#13;
Provincial Directorate o f MoEF or any other Government institutions and post review&#13;
were met. During the project implementation, World Bank missions will supervise the&#13;
overall screening process and implementation o f environmental recommendations for the&#13;
selected enterprise. The World Bank supervision team will also review, ad hoc,&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main development objective of the
            Access to Finance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
            Project of Turkey is to increase Turkish SMEs' access
            to medium term finance. Key proposed indicators to measure
            project outcomes include: (a) Number of SMEs and SME
            portfolios financed under the project; (b) Share of medium
            term-financing (more than 12 months) in the total SME loan
            portfolio (c) Non-performing loan ratios for the project;
            (d) Share of credit line disbursed in local currency under
            the project; and (e) Number of provinces with active SME
            clients financed under the project. To assess project
            implementation progress, the World Bank will also monitor
            the amount of credit disbursed over the originally planned
            disbursement. In addition to the indicators included above,
            the project will monitor basic indicators providing an
            overview, of (a) the profile of SMEs financed under the
            project (e.g., amount of sales, number of workers, economic
            sector); (b) the lending technologies used; and (c) overall
            increase in access to finance for the SME sector in Turkey.
            These indicators will be monitored for analytical purposes
            only and serve as useful inputs to define policies and
            projects aimed at further improving access to credit for
            SMEs in Turkey.
