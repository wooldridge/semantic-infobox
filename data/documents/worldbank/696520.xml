INDIA&#13;
SECOND DISTRICT PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:          India, acting by its President&#13;
Beneficiaries:     Government of India (GOI) and the Governments of Assam,&#13;
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh,&#13;
Maharashtra, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. The Gujarat&#13;
component is expected to be financed by the Government of the&#13;
Netherlands.&#13;
Amount:            SDR 291.7 Million (US$425.2 million equivalent)&#13;
Poverty:           Program of Targeted Interventions (PTI). The proposed project&#13;
would contribute to the alleviation of poverty by improving&#13;
primary education outcomes in about 70 districts in Project states.&#13;
Beneficiaries of the project would overwhelmingly be poor&#13;
children, especially children with mild to moderate disabilities,&#13;
girls, and SC/ST students for whom specific strategies to reduce&#13;
dropout, increase access and enhance learning achievement are&#13;
included in the project.&#13;
Terms:             Standard, with 35 years maturity&#13;
On-Lending Terms: The GOI would make the proceeds of the Credit available as&#13;
grants to the States of Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal&#13;
Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,&#13;
Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. GOI would assume&#13;
foreign exchange risk..&#13;
Description:       The proposed project will have four components: (a) Building&#13;
and Strengthening State Institutional Capacity in Project states to:&#13;
(i) appraise and supervise the implementation of district-level&#13;
programs designed to improve the quality and efficiency of&#13;
primary education; and (ii) provide technical support for program&#13;
management, instructional materials development, improved&#13;
teaching, improved planning and management and research and&#13;
evaluation; (b) Improving the Quality of, Reducing Dropout&#13;
from, and Expanding Access to Primary Education by&#13;
strengthening the capacity of district and sub-district institutions&#13;
to plan and manage program delivery; developing community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
participation and awareness; improving teacher in-service&#13;
training, learning materials and teaching aids; implementing&#13;
targeted interventions for girls, children with mild to moderate&#13;
disabilities, scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST)&#13;
students and early childhood education; and constructing new&#13;
classrooms  and  improving  existing  school  facilities  in&#13;
participating districts; (c) Developing a Distance Education&#13;
Program to support DPEP in-service teacher training activities;&#13;
and (d) Continuing the National Management Structure Support&#13;
for DPEP designed and implemented under DPEP I to strengthen&#13;
the capacity of national institutions to appraise, monitor, assist&#13;
and evaluate state and district investment proposals.&#13;
Benefits:          The proposed credit would be the second investment in a longer-&#13;
term program to improve literacy and numeracy skills in India,&#13;
particularly of the rural poor, and hence to increase productivity&#13;
and welfare. The total number of beneficiaries would be more&#13;
than double the number to be reached by DPEP I. The proposed&#13;
project aims to improve the quality of instruction and learning&#13;
achievement for approximately 10 million children per year. It is&#13;
expected that more than 50 percent of the children benefiting&#13;
from the project would be girls.  Another objective of the&#13;
proposed credit is to raise the proportion of primary school&#13;
completers by improving access to, and reducing dropout from,&#13;
primary schools. The project would provide access to primary&#13;
education for an estimated one million additional children per year&#13;
and would enable more than 4 million more children per year to&#13;
complete primary education.&#13;
The economic and social benefits from raising the proportion of&#13;
primary school completers are large. In addition, many of the&#13;
economic and social benefits have spillover effects beyond the&#13;
child and his/her parents. The economic impact of primary&#13;
schooling in India has been demonstrated in several ways. The&#13;
most recent rate of return study of primary schooling has&#13;
indicated a return of 13 percent.  More recent studies have&#13;
demonstrated the impact of schooling on the utilization of new&#13;
technology, and its outcomes in agriculture. For every one rupee&#13;
increase in profit due to exogenous technical change, those&#13;
households having a member with primary schooling gained an&#13;
additional 1.38 rupees. In addition, farmers with little or no&#13;
schooling benefited from their more schooled neighbors who&#13;
were the first to adopt the new practices. Bank studies on poverty&#13;
in Indian states conclude that levels of literacy have had long term&#13;
effects on both consumption levels and poverty reduction. A&#13;
recent study to disaggregate the sources of growth in the Indian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-vi-&#13;
economy during the 1970s indicated that education in general,&#13;
and primary education in particular, had a major impact.&#13;
Evidence of the social impact of primary schooling is very strong&#13;
and has been augmented by the recent National Family Health&#13;
Surveys for each state. The impact of mothers' schooling on the&#13;
total fertility rate, the ideal number of children, infant and child&#13;
mortality, child immunization rates and nutritional status is very&#13;
strong within each state. Further, comparisons across states&#13;
strongly suggest that the impact has increasing returns once some&#13;
threshold coverage of primary schooling has been attained. Since&#13;
the districts funded under DPEP are by definition poorly&#13;
developed in terms of educational coverage, the social benefits&#13;
are likely to be high.&#13;
An additional benefit of the project will be an increase in the&#13;
internal efficiency of the school system. On average, a provision&#13;
of 8.5 years of schooling is required to produce one completer of&#13;
the five year primary school cycle. DPEP places a major emphasis&#13;
on increasing the quality of education and reducing the drop out&#13;
rate in primary schools. On the assumption that increases in the&#13;
quality of inputs will reduce repetition and dropout levels by half,&#13;
a total of 6.3 years would be required. This would reduce the&#13;
costs per graduate by 25 percent or around Rs. 2,200. Across the&#13;
70 project districts, a total of about 11.8 million children are&#13;
enrolled. These figures imply a 'saving' in the schooling of these&#13;
children equal to US$790 million over approximately six years,&#13;
which can be utilized both to enroll additional children and to&#13;
increase the inputs per child.&#13;
Risks:             The ability of states to sustain the incremental recurrent costs at&#13;
the end of the project on non-plan budgets will essentially depend&#13;
on the future strength of the economy and the methods used to&#13;
adjust to underlying unsustainable trends in revenue growth and&#13;
expenditures evident. in several project states.  Assuming a&#13;
continuation of past real rates of growth in non-plan expenditures&#13;
to the end of the project for the new states, the annual recurring&#13;
costs in the year following the end of the project are estimated to&#13;
be equal to less than 12 percent of the normal increase in&#13;
expenditures for that year in Gujarat and Orissa, and just over 40&#13;
percent in Himachal Pradesh. On this assumption, the additional&#13;
costs would be comfortably covered in each state.  Previous&#13;
analysis suggests that in each DPEP I state, apart from Haryana&#13;
and Assam, the incremental costs might just be covered by the&#13;
normal departmental increment. The most serious problems are&#13;
likely to arise for Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Both are&#13;
among the group of poorest states. The need to improve the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-vii-&#13;
public finances of these states will be intensified by this project.&#13;
Currently, there is clear evidence of an increased commitment to&#13;
provide the resources for universal primary schooling by both&#13;
central and state governments. Furthermore, the experience of&#13;
UPBEP and the DPEP I are very encouraging in this regard. The&#13;
National Development Council has made a commitment to&#13;
increase resources for education from the current level of under&#13;
four percent of GDP to six percent by the end of the Ninth Plan.&#13;
In addition to the project's financial sustainability risk, there are a&#13;
number of project managerial and implementation risks, among&#13;
which the most important are to ensure that: (a) state and district&#13;
management capacity are in place at the start-up phase of project&#13;
irnplementation; (b) the DPEP experience gained by the DPEP&#13;
Bureau and the Technical Support Group (TSG) during DPEP I&#13;
implementation is channeled to the participating DPEP I states; and&#13;
(c) accountability in participating states and districts is based on&#13;
project monitoring and is performance based. These risks are being&#13;
addressed in the project by: (a) establishing and staffing State&#13;
Implementation Societies (SISs), State Project Offices (SPOs)&#13;
and District Project Offices (DPOs) with key qualified personnel&#13;
before the appraisal consideration of any district investment&#13;
proposals; (b) ensuring that there will be a progressive transfer of&#13;
responsibility from the DPEP Bureau to the SPOs for project&#13;
supervision; and (c) making eligibility requirements for all DPEP&#13;
II expansion districts contingent upon good prior project&#13;
implementation performance under DPEP I, or, in the case of&#13;
Uttar Pradesh, under UPBEP. The project monitoring and&#13;
information system designed and implemented under DPEP I&#13;
financing will be used to monitor and evaluate this requirement.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
SECOND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
I. SUB-SECTORAL BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1          Substantial gains have been made in providing access to education to Indian&#13;
children over the past four decades. Particularly encouraging has been the rapid increase in&#13;
female enrollment and the corresponding rise in the gross enrollment rate in recent years. Also&#13;
noteworthy is the fact that, nationwide, virtually all primary students have timely access to&#13;
textbooks. Nonetheless, ongoing Economic and Sector Work (ESW) carried out as a&#13;
collaborative effort between IDA staff and national researchers demonstrates that much&#13;
remains to be done. The literacy rate in 1991 for those aged seven years and above was 64&#13;
percent for males and 39 percent for females (Annex 1, Table 1-1). The number of illiterates&#13;
increased from 302 to 324 million between 1981 and 1991. About 33 million children in the&#13;
6-10 years age-cohort, 60 percent of them girls, remain out of school (Annex 1, Table 1-2);&#13;
about half of these - especially those living in remote rural areas, belonging to hard to reach&#13;
groups or requiring special education needs, never enroll, while many others are enrolled but&#13;
do not attend regularly. Enrollment expansion in India has not been matched by a comparable&#13;
expansion of educational facilities. Surveys in educationally disadvantaged districts show that&#13;
learning achievement is very low, even in states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, that have&#13;
achieved full enrollment and comparatively low dropout rates.&#13;
1.2         In 1992, 97.7 million children were enrolled in 575,000 lower primary&#13;
schools.' Another 40 million children were enrolled in 156,000 upper primary schools.&#13;
Provisional statistics from the 1993 Sixth All-India Education Survey indicate a gross&#13;
enrollment ratio (GER) at the primary level of 95.9 percent, up from 91.2 percent in 1987.&#13;
Particularly encouraging is the rapid increase in female enrollment, which resulted in a GER&#13;
for girls of 85 percent in 1993, up from 77.6 percent in 1987. In addition, approximately&#13;
250,000 non-formal education (NFE) centers provided primary education for an estimated&#13;
seven million children in the 9-14 age group who either do not enter or who drop out of&#13;
school.&#13;
' Elementary education in India consists of four or five years of lower primary school, depending on the state,&#13;
plus three years of upper primary schooling. A child is expected to enter Grade I at the age of 6 and to&#13;
complete eight years of schooling by age 14.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.3          Primary education in India is the joint responsibility of the central and state&#13;
governments, although almost 96 percent of the funding is provided by the states. In the&#13;
Seventh Five Year Plan (1985-1990) the states provided 63 percent of the plan (investment)&#13;
resources in primary education and 100 percent of non-plan (recurrent) costs. States differ in&#13;
administration and definition of the steps on the educational ladder, but most have adopted the&#13;
national model of five years of lower primary plus three years of upper primary schooling;&#13;
some states have adopted a four plus three structure for lower and upper primary schooling.&#13;
Together, lower and upper primary cycles and non-formal education are referred to in India as&#13;
elementary education.&#13;
1.4          With the exception of a few southern states, notably Kerala and Tamil Nadu,&#13;
rural primary education is largely public. Less than three percent of rural primary schools&#13;
were government-aided private schools (usually receiving grants for teacher salaries) and&#13;
about one percent were private un-aided schools. In contrast, 40 percent of urban primary&#13;
schools were government-aided or fully private.&#13;
1.5          The National Policy on Education (1986) set the stage for an increasingly&#13;
important role for the central government in primary education.  The policy explicitly&#13;
recognized the need for a concerted effort to expand and improve basic education, including&#13;
both formal and non-formal primary education, as well as adult literacy education. At the&#13;
primary level, the policy called for priority attention to reducing the disparities in enrollment&#13;
for girls, scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) students. To implement the policy,&#13;
the Department of Education (DOE) of the Ministry of Human Resources Development&#13;
(MBRD) of the Government of India (GOI) created the following sets of centrally sponsored&#13;
grant schemes to provide assistance to states with the development of basic education:&#13;
(a) Operation Blackboard (OBB), to construct an additional classroom, post an additional&#13;
teacher to single teacher schools, and distribute a pre-determined standardized package of&#13;
teaching materials and aides; (b) Minimum Levels of Learning (MLL), to identify basic&#13;
competencies in language, mathematics and social/environmental studies to be taught in the&#13;
primary grades for each state and to develop and distribute accordingly new textbooks;&#13;
(c) District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs), to help primary school teachers&#13;
improve their effectiveness; and (d) Total Literacy Campaigns (TLCs), to provide adult&#13;
literacy instruction along with vocational skills training in selected district centers.&#13;
1.6          Two autonomous national resource institutions are financed by the GOI to&#13;
provide professional and academic leadership in education. These are the National Council&#13;
for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), and the National Institute of Educational&#13;
Planning and Administration (NIEPA). Recently, GOI established the National Council for&#13;
Teacher Education as an apex institution to provide national teaching training programs.&#13;
These institutions, all located in New Delhi, work closely with counterpart organizations in&#13;
the states, providing training, research and planning support.&#13;
B. Issues&#13;
1.7          This section is based on the extensive economic and sector work (ESW)&#13;
carried-out in collaboration with the DOE/GOI, the District Primary Education Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(DPEP) Bureau of the DOE/GOI and major Indian research institutions and scholars, in&#13;
particular NCERT and NIEPA, during the preparation of DPEP I and throughout the past&#13;
three years. The ESW concludes that it is imperative to improve the effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency of primary education in India. Weak educational outcomes signal low returns to&#13;
investment and a failure to capture the significant benefits in poverty reduction, economic&#13;
development and social returns that primary education has been shown to generate,&#13;
internationally and in India. Over the past decade a large body of evidence has accumulated to&#13;
suggest that when a critical minimum of educational attainment across the population has been&#13;
achieved, particularly, though not exclusively for girls, it pays substantial returns to society in&#13;
terms of: (a) raising the productivity of workers; (b) generating substantial additional social&#13;
benefits in the form of improved family health and welfare; and (c) contributing to lower&#13;
fertility and slower rates of population growth. As long as the education system fails to&#13;
deliver good quality primary education to a large proportion of the population, India will find&#13;
it difficult to accelerate and sustain a process of equitable social and economic development.&#13;
1.8          The DPEP program is designed to address the following principal constraints&#13;
on sub-sector efficiency and effectiveness: (a) shortfalls in access, indicated by the large&#13;
number of children that never enroll and a continuing high level of illiteracy; (b) low internal&#13;
efficiency, reflected by high repetition and dropout rates; (c) unacceptably low levels of&#13;
quality, as evidenced by low levels of learning achievement; (d) inequities, as manifested by&#13;
considerable variations of educational disadvantages due to gender, caste and tribal affiliation;&#13;
and (e) sub-sector constraints, as displayed by historically inadequate financing and weak&#13;
management at the national, state and district levels.&#13;
1.9          Access. Despite substantial improvements since 1986, the literacy rate in 1991&#13;
for those aged seven years and above was 64 percent for males and 39 percent for females. In&#13;
four major states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan) the overall female&#13;
literacy rate was below 30 percent. By contrast, Kerala, which has the highest literacy rates in&#13;
India (94 percent for males and 86 percent for females), has achieved universal enrollment and&#13;
comparatively high levels of completion of the lower primary cycle (Annex 1, Table 1-1).&#13;
1.10         The percentage of school-age children who participate in primary schooling&#13;
has been steadily increasing in India in the last decade. However, major challenges remain&#13;
despite the progress in the expansion of access to primary education. The total GER of 90-95&#13;
percent suggests at first sight that access to primary education is no longer an issue, especially&#13;
among 6-10 year old males.  However, this ratio obscures problems of age-cohort&#13;
undercounts2, over-age student enrollment, low attendance, a gap in female primary education&#13;
coverage, especially in impoverished rural areas, and insufficient coverage of children with&#13;
disabilities. Although gaps in access and completion have been reduced in recent years&#13;
nationwide, a disproportionate number of non-enrolled and dropouts are from the poorest&#13;
households, girls, learning disabled students and members of SCs and STs.&#13;
2 The primary school GER of 104.5 percent reported in the Selected Educational Statistics 1993-94 of the&#13;
Ministry of Human Resource Development (1994) is overestimated because its denominator relies on an age-&#13;
cohort estimated from the 1981 census, which experts agree suffered from severe undercounting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.11         Primary schools in India enroll a considerable number of over-aged students.&#13;
The official GER also overestimates school enrollment of the age cohort by including in the&#13;
numerator an estimated 20 percent of the enrolled students who fall outside the official range&#13;
of 6-10, most of whom in India are over age. At least 16 million children in the 6-10 age-&#13;
cohort, approximately 60 percent of them girls, never enroll in primary schools. Most of these&#13;
children live in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan; a large majority are&#13;
likely to live in low female literacy districts in these states. Also, many of the out-of-school&#13;
children live in remote areas in these and other states and belong to SC and ST groups, and/or&#13;
have special education needs.&#13;
1.12         In addition, access problems are exacerbated by student non-attendance. A&#13;
significant proportion of children who are enrolled do not attend classes regularly, and -- for&#13;
all intents -- can be considered 'but of school" The exact number is not known, but it is&#13;
estimated that about 16 million children age 6-10 (of which about two thirds are girls) fall in&#13;
this category. It is possible that some of these children attend non-formal classes, which offer&#13;
a two-year condensed program which for only a few results in learning achievement equivalent&#13;
to primary schools. The lowest attendance rates are found in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya&#13;
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan which together contain two thirds of the primary&#13;
school-age children who do not attend. It is clear that progress towards the goal of universal&#13;
primary education (UPE) will critically depend on progress in expanding school enrollment&#13;
and regular attendance in these states.&#13;
1.13         According to estimates, about 4 percent of children age 6-10 suffer from&#13;
various kinds of disabilities in varying degrees. A majority of them have mild (learning) to&#13;
moderate disabilities and can be integrated and mainstreamed in primary school. GOI has&#13;
promulgated in 1996 an Act which mandates provision of access to children with disabilities&#13;
who can be integrated in primary school. The National Policy on Education also provides for&#13;
integrated education for such children. Universalization of primary education in India, which&#13;
is the main objective of DPEP, will remain incomplete in the absence of such integrated&#13;
education.&#13;
1.14         Improving access to primary schooling will also require continuing efforts to&#13;
provide classroom and teacher capacity to accommodate all children of primary age. In some&#13;
states that have almost achieved UPE coverage, like Kerala, existing physical capacity is&#13;
largely adequate. But that is not the case in other states. The physical space shortage to&#13;
accommodate the potential total primary education enrollment of 105.7 million children has&#13;
been estimated at about one million classrooms (Annex 1, Table 1-3). In addition, much of&#13;
the stock of available classrooms is in poor repair, and many schools lack water supply and&#13;
adequate sanitary facilities (Para. 1.20).&#13;
1.15         Similarly, more primary education teachers will be needed to staff the&#13;
classrooms and teach the increasing number of children. In 1993 there were almost 2 million&#13;
primary education teachers in India, an increase of 9 percent since 1986. However, this&#13;
increase has not been enough to make progress toward the full enrollment of the age group or&#13;
keep up with the growth of enrollment (14 percent) during that period. As a result, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
student to teacher ratio increased from about 45:1 in 1986 to 49:1 in 1993. Reversing this&#13;
trend and bringing the ratio down to an average of 40:1 (the norm adopted for DPEP) would&#13;
require the creation of an additional 450,000 teaching positions. To achieve UPE would&#13;
require 200,000 teaching positions beyond that.   The teacher shortage problem  is&#13;
compounded when, as is often the case in rural schools with high dropout, the higher student-&#13;
teacher ratios are found in the first few grades and when, as is also frequently the case, the&#13;
least experienced teachers are assigned to those grades.&#13;
1.16         Internal Efficiency. Repetition is high among primary education students.&#13;
International experience suggests that students who repeat are more likely to drop out. It is&#13;
estimated that as a result of repetition and dropout, about 8.5 years per student are currently&#13;
spent to provide the regular five year primary cycle. Policies on repetition vary considerably&#13;
between states. Some states (Maharashtra and Karnataka) follow an automatic promotion&#13;
policy, while others follow a policy of no repetition up to grade 2 (Haryana) or grade 3 (Uttar&#13;
Pradesh). Where repetition does occur it is highest among first and second graders. In&#13;
addition, even where automatic promotion policies have been adopted, informal repetition&#13;
remains frequent. Data collected in baseline studies suggests that from 20 to 40 percent of&#13;
students in low-literacy districts have repeated at least one year. Repetition is a significant&#13;
cause of inefficiency as it results in school places occupied by average repeaters not being&#13;
available to students of the expected age, without substantial crowding.&#13;
1.17         Dropping out of school leads to a substantial waste of scarce resources. While&#13;
average dropout rates in grade I in India have come down from 22 percent in 1985 to 7.8&#13;
percent in 1990, recent data show that overall primary cycle dropout rates remain&#13;
unacceptably high, and in some states such as Gujarat and Orissa, they are staggering at about&#13;
51 percent for female students. A particular cause for concern is the fact that more than half&#13;
of dropouts occur in grades 1 and 2, well before students can be expected to have learned&#13;
much of the curriculum.&#13;
1.18         Low Educational Quality.  The recent large-scale, sample-based learning&#13;
achievement studies conducted in 42 low-literacy districts in seven states under DPEP I, and&#13;
currently being conducted in 12 districts of three new states (Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and&#13;
Orissa) conclude: (a) students are poorly prepared for school; (b) the quality of school inputs&#13;
is low; and (c) the effectiveness of the existing teacher corps is very limited.  As a&#13;
consequence, many of the students who do complete primary school learn relatively little.&#13;
Studies of student learning achievement in the second and final year of lower primary school&#13;
in seven states show that, on average, students have mastered fewer than a quarter of the&#13;
curriculum objectives.&#13;
1.19         First graders are poorly prepared for school. In low literacy districts, two-&#13;
thirds or more of students are first-time learners from illiterate homes. Early childhood&#13;
education (ECE) reaches about 40 percent of such children through the Integrated Child&#13;
Development Services (ICDS) and other state-run pre-primary education and nutrition&#13;
programs. Research in India and elsewhere has found that high quality ECE improves primary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
school attendance and learning achievement. But in many states in India, the potential of ECE&#13;
is constrained by inappropriate curricula and learning materials, untrained teachers, and&#13;
inadequate supervision.&#13;
1.20         The quality of school inputs is low. Textbooks are overly difficult, with many&#13;
students unable to read them; their publication quality is low, and state textbook publication&#13;
systems suffer, in varying ways and to varying extent, from inefficient practices. While there&#13;
are blackboards, consumable supplies and educational aids are conspicuous by their absence&#13;
and, when present, by low utilization. Appropriate instructional teaching and learning&#13;
materials for the integration of children with disabilities into primary school are lacking in&#13;
India. Buildings are poorly designed and inadequately maintained. According to a 1986/87&#13;
national survey, 44 percent of lower primary schools did not have proper buildings, 74 percent&#13;
lacked libraries, and 95 percent lacked toilets.&#13;
1.21         The effectiveness of the existing teacher corps is very limited. Although most&#13;
teachers have 10 or more years of education and have formal pre-service training, very few&#13;
have adequate pedagogical skills and demonstrate good teaching practices. Many primary&#13;
teachers possess little understanding of the materials they teach and have not studied such&#13;
core subjects as mathematics or the language of instruction beyond grades 8 or 10. Moreover,&#13;
most are ill-prepared to address effectively the challenge of teaching in multi-grade classrooms&#13;
groups of students who vary greatly in age, ability and achievement. Primary school teachers&#13;
are not appropriately trained to detect and assess children with disabilities and to assist them&#13;
into their integration to school. A survey some years ago noted that less than 6 percent of&#13;
teachers had received any in-service training. In some states, weak supervision leads to high&#13;
rates of teacher absenteeism; in small schools, this results in high effective student-teacher&#13;
ratios and, too often, children without teachers. A student to teacher ratio of 49:1 makes the&#13;
introduction of more effective teaching and learning strategies difficult and places an undue&#13;
burden on the teachers, especially in multi-grade and multi-age situations that are common in&#13;
rural areas of India.&#13;
1.22         Inequities.   There are large variations in primary education enrollment,&#13;
attendance, retention and learning achievement rates. Three relevant gaps are most evident:&#13;
gender, poverty, and SC/ST.&#13;
1.23         There is ample evidence that girl suffer severe educational disadvantages in&#13;
India. Literacy rates for females aged seven years and above (39 percent) are substantially&#13;
lower than those for males (64 percent). In two of the project states (Madhya Pradesh and&#13;
Uttar Pradesh) the gender gap for literacy was nearly 30 percentage points (Annex 1, Table 1-&#13;
4). Even though the female primary education GER has been increasing steadily over the past&#13;
15 years, it is still about 17 percentage points lower than that for males. There is, however,&#13;
wide diversity among states. In Uttar Pradesh, this gap exceeds 25 percentage points, while in&#13;
Kerala, Assam, and Tamil Nadu, the gap is less than 7 points (Annex 1, Table 1-5).&#13;
1.24         More girls than boys drop out of school at all levels, including primary.&#13;
According to the most recent DOE statistics (1994), 45 percent of girls and 41 percent of&#13;
boys dropout between primary grades I and 5. Although the gender gap in dropout appears&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
low and is declining, the impact of even this modest gap is significant, and translates into&#13;
approximately one million more females than males annually who lack a completed primary&#13;
education.&#13;
1.25         Poverty affects the extent to which children enroll and stay in school. Children&#13;
from the poorest households are educationally disadvantaged, in comparison with those from&#13;
wealthier households. Literacy rates are significantly lower for those in the lowest income&#13;
quintile, for both rural and urban population groups (Annex 1, Table 1-6). Children of poor&#13;
families, especially in the rural areas, are less likely to be enrolled in schools and drop out four&#13;
times as often as children of more advantaged families (Annex 1, Table 1-7). Lastly, children&#13;
from poor households score lower on achievement tests than do children from wealthier&#13;
households (Annex 1, Table 1-8). The poverty gap, especially in rural areas, is mainly caused&#13;
by the inability of parents to afford the direct and indirect costs associated with sending their&#13;
children to school. Recent data suggest that a household could spend up to Rs. 400 per year&#13;
to send a child to school, not counting foregone labor.&#13;
1.26         Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) have historically been&#13;
disadvantaged socially, economically and educationally, and have been specifically targeted&#13;
under post independence anti-discrimination legislation. Nonetheless, school participation for&#13;
both SC and ST children remains significantly lower than that for non-SC/ST children (Annex&#13;
1, Table 1-9). The non-attendance gap for SC students ranges from less than one percent in&#13;
Haryana and Maharashtra to almost 18 percent in Assam and other northeastern states. For&#13;
ST students, the school non-attendance gap ranges from less than one percent in Orissa and&#13;
Kerala to almost five percent in Maharashtra. While dropout rates for SC students were&#13;
indistinguishable from those of the general population, those for ST students were higher -&#13;
about 17 percentage points for grades I to 5. Finally, both SC and ST students perform less&#13;
well than non-SC or non-ST students on tests of language and mathematics.&#13;
1.27         Recent research has identified several causes of the gaps discussed above.&#13;
Parents prefer to educate sons rather than daughters. Boys are expected to earn more, and&#13;
confer higher status to the family. Most importantly, the returns to their education investment&#13;
will remain with the family. Conversely, the returns to investment in a daughter's education&#13;
will typically flow to her husband's family. School quality, teaching practices, lack of female&#13;
teachers, school distance from the household and curriculum also contribute to the gender&#13;
gap. In addition, girls' contribution to household work often conflicts with schooling.&#13;
1.28         The SC gap is caused by both economic factors and past tradition of&#13;
discrimination. Children from SC households are much more likely to be working than are&#13;
children in non-SC households.&#13;
1.29         The ST schooling gap is caused mainly by cultural discontinuity between family&#13;
and school, language of instruction, and school quality.  Most tribal children are first&#13;
generation learners, and thus their families are less likely to be familiar with and support&#13;
school learning. The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution establishes that states and local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
authorities are to provide instruction in the mother tongue at the primary stage for all&#13;
linguistic minorities, including tribal children. However, tribal languages are not widely used&#13;
as the medium of instruction. Implementation of the policy also has been constrained by the&#13;
presence of over 400 tribal languages and dialects, only 60 of which are written. Schools with&#13;
high concentration of ST students are generally less well endowed than those with low&#13;
concentration of ST students. Finally, the geographical dispersion of tribal children makes&#13;
implementation of interventions difficult.&#13;
1.30        Inadequate Financing and Weak Management.  With the issuance of the&#13;
Revised National Policy on Education and a National Program of Action in 1992, the GOI&#13;
intensified central leadership and support for primary education development.  This had&#13;
important implications for management of education. This process is expected to accelerate&#13;
further. The institutional mechanisms needed at all levels of decision making (central, state&#13;
and district) to manage expanded investment and to provide technical leadership have&#13;
received, until recently, little attention. Reforms will now need to be carried out in a changing&#13;
institutional environment caused by the implementation by states of the Seventy-third and&#13;
Seventy-fourth Amendments to the Constitution of India (1992) that provide for increased&#13;
responsibility on the part of elected local governments (Panchayat Raj institutions-PRI) for&#13;
social programs, including education.&#13;
1.31        Total state and central government expenditures on education are equal to&#13;
around 3.7 percent of GDP and 13 percent of all government expenditure. These shares have&#13;
slowly increased over the past five decades though they remain below the peak reached in&#13;
1989/90. State governments contribute nine tenths of the total, though the central&#13;
governments' share has increased during the past decade and almost 40 percent of plan&#13;
expenditures are funded by the center. The financial commitment to education varies&#13;
significantly between states. Expenditures vary between 3.0 and 7.5 percent of state domestic&#13;
product and between 18 and 28 percent of government expenditure. Since these variations&#13;
have existed for several decades, the differences in educational development between states,&#13;
and the financial requirements to address them, differ substantially.&#13;
1.32        The distribution of overall educational expenditure between levels has&#13;
remained constant over the past two decades. In 1993/94, 46 percent was allocated to&#13;
elementary education. Since 1980 the average annual increase in real expenditure on&#13;
elementary education has been almost seven percent. Most of this increase, however, has&#13;
funded more teachers and higher salaries. Roughly 97 and 96 percent of education department&#13;
expenditures on lower and upper primary schooling, respectively, are for salaries. The second&#13;
most important input is incentive programs, often funded by other departments. These are&#13;
equal to around five percent of the overall unit cost. Little remains for providing educational&#13;
materials and other inputs, such as in-service teacher training and the maintenance of facilities&#13;
necessary to encourage school attendance and provide an effective learning environment.&#13;
1.33        With the launching of the Eighth Plan in 1992, the central government, in&#13;
particular, planned for a substantial increase in the funding of elementary education. Projected&#13;
investments were US$3 billion compared to less than US$1 billion over the Seventh Plan&#13;
period, 1985-90. Between 1992/93 and 1995/96, central government expenditures have more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
than met the targets. Several state governments have also increased real expenditures. In&#13;
others states, however, policy changes have not been sufficiently rapid to deal with&#13;
deteriorating public finances, and increases in plan expenditure for education have been small.&#13;
The Government has set the goal of ensuring that resources equal to six percent of GDP are&#13;
provided for the education system by the end of the Ninth Plan period. If current GDP&#13;
growth rates are maintained, the achievement of this goal would result in very large increases.&#13;
The challenges will be to ensure that state governments provide their share of the projected&#13;
increase and that the additional resources are well targeted across the country towards those&#13;
inputs and interventions which will cost-effectively expand access, and encourage children to&#13;
attend schools which provide a higher quality schooling.&#13;
1.34         At the school level, the central priority will be to establish well-managed&#13;
schools, including: (i) increased autonomy and accountability for the headteacher as well as&#13;
responsibility as a school leader and pedagogical resource; (ii) implementation of more&#13;
effective instructional strategies including the regular monitoring of student learning; and&#13;
(iii) involvement of the village education committees (VEC) and local PRIs in monitoring&#13;
enrollment, student and teacher attendance, community activation, school level planning and&#13;
resource mobilization.&#13;
1.35         At the intermediate (state and district) levels, institutions would have to ensure&#13;
the: (i) formulation of policies and priorities and resource allocation decisions through the&#13;
PRIs; (ii) provision of technical support and assistance to schools through the cluster and&#13;
block resource centers, as well as through the DIETs; and (iii) provision of resources and&#13;
administrative guidance through the PRI and the DOE/GOI.  At the central level, a&#13;
professional base needs to be established to support the strengthening of state institutions by&#13;
developing national resource teams in key areas with resources drawn from a wide range of&#13;
institutions, such as inter alia, NCERT, NIEPA, university education and non-education&#13;
departments and NGOs, and establishing a documentation and dissemination center of&#13;
educational resources.&#13;
C. Policy and Policy hnplementation&#13;
1.36         Policy.  The Revised National Policy on Education (1992) and the 1992&#13;
Program of Action provide the basic policy framework for central and state investments in&#13;
primary education development. The objectives for primary education, in order of priority,&#13;
are to: (a) reduce dropout; (b) improve learning achievement; and (c) expand access for&#13;
unserved students.   Girls, SC  and ST  students are to be given priority attention.&#13;
Decentralization of responsibility for planning and managing primary education development&#13;
programs at the district level, and strengthening of school/community organizations, are&#13;
advocated as a means of developing locality specific strategies and implementation plans and&#13;
of increasing ownership of schooling by communities. The policy framework is thus well&#13;
aligned with principal sub-sectoral constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
1.37         Policy Implementation. To achieve these policy objectives, the DOE/GOI, in&#13;
close consultation with the states, established the District Primary Education Program (DPEP)&#13;
in 1993 as a cabinet-approved, centrally sponsored program of financial and technical&#13;
assistance to states and districts for primary education reform. The DPEP management and&#13;
intervention designs draw explicitly on experience gained through the central schemes and,&#13;
most significantly, the state education projects in Andhra Pradesh (ODA), Bihar (UNICEF),&#13;
Rajasthan (SIDA) and Uttar Pradesh (IDA).  DPEP finances in selected districts the&#13;
development and implementation of replicable, sustainable and cost-effective programs to: (i)&#13;
reduce differences in enrollment, dropout and learning achievement between gender and social&#13;
groups to less than five percent; (ii) reduce overall primary dropout rates for all students to&#13;
less than ten percent; (iii) raise average achievement levels by at least 25 percent over&#13;
measured baseline levels by ensuring achievement of basic literacy and numeracy&#13;
competencies and a minimum of 40 percent achievement levels in other competencies by all&#13;
primary school children; (iv) provide access for all children to primary schooling or its&#13;
equivalent non-formal education; and (v) strengthen the capacity of national, state, and district&#13;
institutions and organizations for the planning, management and evaluation of primary&#13;
education.  DPEP provides a single window entry for most external assistance to primary&#13;
education. The program was launched in 42 districts of seven states in 19943 under a grant of&#13;
150 million ECU provided by the European Community (EC) covering 19 of those districts,&#13;
and an IDA Credit of US$265 million approved in 1994, covering the remaining 23 districts.&#13;
ODA plans to support the expansion of DPEP into additional district projects in West Bengal&#13;
(5 districts) and Andhra Pradesh (5 districts), while the Dutch Government is expected to&#13;
provide finance for three districts in Gujarat.&#13;
1.38         DPEP is managed at the national level by the DPEP Bureau (established in&#13;
1994 in the DOE/GOI), serving as a financial and technical intermediary organization to&#13;
appraise, finance, monitor and supervise state and district action programs. DPEP finances 85&#13;
percent of state and district expenditures, with the balance being provided from state budgets&#13;
on the basis of six year district and state investment plans4. DPEP also provides national&#13;
technical assistance, through a Technical Support Group (TSG), and funding for research and&#13;
development programs to support the development of state and district institutional capacity.&#13;
Progress is monitored closely and serves as the basis for annual budget allocations to district&#13;
and state projects. Learning achievement and dropout indicators will be monitored every&#13;
three years against baseline studies established for each participating district.  DPEP&#13;
Guidelines and an Administrative Program Manual, reviewed by IDA and approved by&#13;
DOE/GOI in 1995, have been distributed to participating states and districts.&#13;
1.39         DPEP differs from other centrally sponsored schemes, which provide resources&#13;
to states for the implementation of standard program designs, in five principal ways:&#13;
(i) proposals for financing projects are developed by each participating district and state;&#13;
(ii) proposals are appraised by the DPEP Bureau against technical, managerial and financial&#13;
3 Assam, Karnataka, Kerala, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. Discussions and&#13;
planning are underway in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, Gujarat and West Bengal.&#13;
4 The Finance Ministry and the Planning Commission have approved an increased allocation for primary&#13;
education of US$650 million to the DOE for implementation of DPEP over the balance of the Eighth Plan&#13;
period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
criteria; (iii) participating states must make DPEP grants fully additional to normal growth of&#13;
education budgets; (iv) funds are made available to states and districts annually on the basis of&#13;
performance reviews and proposals for the next year, allowing for poorly performing districts to&#13;
be dropped from the program and be replaced; and (v) implementation support and technical&#13;
assistance are made available to states and districts through contracts with research and&#13;
development agencies.&#13;
1.40         In creating the DPEP, the GOI has established a mechanism to provide financial&#13;
and technical assistance to participating states and districts to build their capacity, as soon as&#13;
possible, during a period in which the states implement new forms of decentralized education&#13;
management while undergoing fiscal adjustment and reform. In addition, it is considered essential&#13;
to further develop the capacity of national educational research and development institutions to&#13;
provide an increasingly empirical basis for program design and evaluation, and to take an active&#13;
role in developing counterpart agencies in the states. Finally, GOI wishes to have a single&#13;
window for substantial anticipated external assistance to facilitate coordination of donor agencies&#13;
and to ensure that these investments would be equitably targeted and fully implemented in line&#13;
with national policy.&#13;
D. IDA Strategy and Rationale for Involvement&#13;
1.41         The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
Paper, discussed by the Board on June 20, 1995. Promoting economic reform, speeding&#13;
economic growth and alleviating poverty are central to IDA's CAS. Human resource&#13;
development is a key element of this overall strategy, with education development playing a&#13;
central role. IDA aims to improve the access of the poor, scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe&#13;
(ST), and women to investments in human resource development and to improve the quality,&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of these investments. Low educational enrollments, high dropout&#13;
rates, and unacceptably low levels of educational achievement are major constraints to social and&#13;
economic improvement for the poor and socially disadvantaged groups. IDA's strategy for&#13;
education is to focus medium-term assistance for education exclusively on primary education,&#13;
given its underdeveloped status in India, its high returns, and its importance to alleviating poverty,&#13;
all of which are being demonstrated in ESW. In addition, IDA has the technical expertise and the&#13;
resources to assist the GOI to take DPEP to the scale necessary to make a visible dent in the&#13;
problems of low enrollment, low learning achievement and persistent illiteracy.&#13;
1.42         Project Readiness. There are three rationales for proceeding with the project at&#13;
this time. First, there is extensive borrower ownership of the DPEP II program. GOI has worked&#13;
very closely with the Project states over the last year in preparing the project and there has&#13;
been widespread participation of research institutions, officials, communities and NGOs&#13;
in project design. In addition, funding plans are ready. Second, the DPEP I project&#13;
and the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Project (UPBEP) are being implemented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
satisfactorily5. They are meeting their qualitative aims to a large extent. Third, the project is&#13;
technically ready to proceed. The detailed framework and program guidelines (Annex 8) for&#13;
managing the DPEP program and state and district involvement in the program have been&#13;
used for more than a year and are working effectively. Detailed district investment proposals&#13;
have been prepared and appraised for 12 of the approximately 70 districts to be involved with&#13;
the project, and about 20 additional district investment proposals are nearing completion.&#13;
Based on experience, the management arrangements, auditing plans, and procurement&#13;
arrangements have been redefined for DPEP.&#13;
E. External Financing&#13;
1.43         The first substantial external assistance for primary education was provided by&#13;
the United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (ODA) for a project in Andhra&#13;
Pradesh; approximately US$35 million was provided through 1992. UNICEF has disbursed&#13;
around US$5 million from agency funds for the Bihar Education Project, and is providing&#13;
support in several states for the piloting of innovative models for in-service teacher training. In&#13;
Rajasthan, the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) has provided&#13;
approximately US$100 million for basic education projects.  The Government of the&#13;
Netherlands is providing approximately US$30 million for Mahila Samakhya, the women's&#13;
empowerment program managed by the GOI/DOE, and has expressed interest in allocating an&#13;
additional US$25.8 million to expand DPEP into three districts in Gujarat. IDA approved a&#13;
credit of US$165 million for the UPBEP in 1993 (Credit 2509-IN). Related to the Program&#13;
to Strengthen the Social Safety Net (Credit 2448-IN), the EC approved in 1993 ECU 150&#13;
million as program support to DPEP; this was the first program of external financing for&#13;
DPEP. IDA approved in 1994 a Credit of US$265 million (Credit 2661-IN) to support the&#13;
implementation of the first phase of DPEP.&#13;
F. Lessons Learned&#13;
1.44         DPEP II has been designed incorporating the following key lessons learned&#13;
from India's efforts in basic education, under donor-assisted state primary education projects&#13;
in Andhra Pradesh (ODA), Bihar (UNICEF), and Rajasthan (SIDA) and from Operation&#13;
Blackboard (GOI): (a) the need for integrated education development programs that address&#13;
inter-related constraints on the availability and quality of basic services; (b) the usefulness of&#13;
formal annual reviews and work program proposals for management control; (c) the viability&#13;
of registered societies as mechanisms to reduce delays in contracting and disbursements&#13;
related to project implementation; and (d) the importance of strengthening the quality of early&#13;
childhood education, textbooks and learning materials, and teacher in-service training.&#13;
5 The implementation performance of DPEP I has been rated as satisfactory according to the latest joint&#13;
IDA/EC supervision report (September 1995). Total disbursements of US$23 million as of April 30, 1996&#13;
amount to about 70 percent of the original SAR forecast. The implementation performance of UPBEP has also&#13;
been rated as satisfactory according to the fifth and latest IDA supervision report (April 1996). Total&#13;
disbursements of US$53.8 million as of April 30, 1996 amount to about 96 percent of the original SAR&#13;
forecast. The above disbursement figures for both projects do not include exchange rate changes that suggest&#13;
that the project disbursements for DPEP I and UPBEP are even closer to the appraisal estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
1.45          Lessons learned from  the ongoing Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Project&#13;
(IDA) and DPEP I (IDA/EC) include the need to: (a) overcome an initial slow start-up of&#13;
project activities and consequent low expenditures and disbursement levels; (b) decentralize&#13;
increased responsibility for program management and district supervision to the SIS and fine-&#13;
tune the operationalization of the national, state and district management and planning&#13;
structures; (c) strengthen the provision of timely technical assistance by the DPEP Bureau to&#13;
participating states and districts in the development, appraisal, approval and implementation of&#13;
district and state plans; and (d) enhance community participation in the operation of schools.&#13;
1.46          Other lessons learned from  IDA-assisted population and human resources&#13;
projects in India which have been incorporated in the design of DPEP II include the need to&#13;
overcome: (a) inadequate attention to management aspects; (b) weak supervision; (c) poor&#13;
maintenance of school buildings; (d) poor procurement; and (e) inadequate attention to&#13;
qualitative aspects.&#13;
1.47          The program  would also draw  on wider international experience in primary&#13;
education development6. This experience substantially validates the DPEP emphasis on ECE,&#13;
improved textbooks and learning materials, intensified in-service teacher training, and&#13;
enhanced community participation in the operation of schools.&#13;
6 These lessons have been summarized in the World Bank Publication by Marlaine E. Lockheed and Adriaan&#13;
Verspoor: Improving Primary Education in Developing Countries, New York: Oxford University Press, 1991.&#13;
Additional lessons of experience from World Bank Project Completion Reports and Audits, and ongoing&#13;
lending experience for primary education, have been discussed with the GOI and taken into account in&#13;
program design. Finally, India has played a leading role in follow-up international activities to the Jomtien&#13;
Conference on Education for All, including hosting of the regional EFA Forum in September, 1993 and the&#13;
Large Country Initiative Conference in December of the same year. Through these consultations the GOI has&#13;
been able to systematically review lessons being learned by other countries.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
2.1          Capitalizing on the experience gained by the ongoing DPEP I IDA Credit&#13;
(Credit 2661-IN), the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Credit (Credit 2509-IN) and the current&#13;
program of ESW, the proposed project would assist the DOE/GOI to extend DPEP into&#13;
about 50 to 60 new districts chosen from Uttar Pradesh and the seven states already&#13;
participating in DPEP I, and up to 15 districts in three new states (Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh&#13;
and Orissa). Like DPEP I, the proposed Project would build national, state, district and sub-&#13;
district7 level managerial and professional capacity for the sustainable development of primary&#13;
education in the project states and would support district-based activities aimed at improving&#13;
access to primary education, reducing dropout and increasing learning achievement, with&#13;
special emphasis on interventions that would target female and SC/ST students, as well as&#13;
children with mild to moderate disabilities. GOI agreed during negotiations that it will carry&#13;
out, and cause the Project states and State Implementation Societies to carry out, the DPEP in&#13;
accordance with DPEP Guidelines (para. 5.1(m) and Annex 8) and that it will not make&#13;
changes to the DPEP or the DPEP Guidelines, which in the reasonable opinion of IDA would&#13;
adversely affect the project (para. 5.1(c)).&#13;
B. Scope And Approach&#13;
2.2           The proposed specific investment credit, with a strong degree of program and&#13;
policy content, is designed to continue providing program support to GOI for the&#13;
development of primary education, with the DPEP Bureau operating as the national&#13;
management authority which appraises state and district programs, as well as state and district&#13;
Annual Work Programs and Budgets (AWPBs). Specifically, it would finance program&#13;
expansion in 50 to 60 districts chosen from Uttar Pradesh and the seven states already&#13;
participating in DPEP I, and up to 15 districts in three new states (Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh,&#13;
and Orissa). Selected districts will satisfy the eligibility criteria described in Annex 8: DPEP&#13;
Guidelines. At negotiations, GOI agreed that districts brought into the project will comply&#13;
with criteria in accordance with the DPEP Guidelines, and that no more than 15 percent of the&#13;
expansion districts would be in districts that have successfully implemented the Total Literacy&#13;
Campaign and have female literacy rates above the national average, but below the state&#13;
average (para. 5.1(d)).  Annex 9 describes the profile of the pool of approximately 110&#13;
districts in the eleven Project states from which 60 to 70 will be selected for funding by DPEP&#13;
II. National management, technical support and capacity building components in DPEP I&#13;
states are being financed by IDA and the EC under DPEP I. Further strengthening of the&#13;
national management structure to assist the implementation of DPEP in the three new states&#13;
and Uttar Pradesh will be financed under DPEP II. Additional support for state and district&#13;
level components is expected to be provided by ODA for Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.&#13;
7Sub-district means a level below the district level, consisting of one or more of the following: Sub-division,&#13;
block, panchayat and village, as well as an area defined as a cluster by a Project state.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
During negotiations, the Government of the Netherlands (GON) confirmed its interest to fund&#13;
the Gujarat DPEP II program through a co-financing arrangement with IDA.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
2.3           The  proposed  project will have  four components: (a) Building  and&#13;
Strengthening State Institutional Capacity in Project states to: (i) appraise and supervise the&#13;
implementation of district-level programs designed to improve the quality and efficiency of&#13;
primary education; and (ii) provide technical support for program management, instructional&#13;
materials development, improved teaching, improved planning and management and research&#13;
and evaluation; (b) Improving the Quality of, Reducing Dropout from, and Expanding Access&#13;
to Primary Education by strengthening the capacity of district and sub-district institutions to&#13;
plan and manage program delivery; developing community participation and awareness;&#13;
improving teacher in-service training, learning materials and teaching aids; implementing&#13;
targeted interventions for girls, children with mild to moderate disabilities, scheduled castes&#13;
(SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) students and early childhood education, and constructing new&#13;
classrooms and improving existing school facilities in participating districts; (c) Developing a&#13;
Distance Education Program to support DPEP in-service teacher training activities; and&#13;
(d) Continuing the National Management Structure Support for DPEP designed and&#13;
implemented under DPEP I to strengthen the capacity of national institutions to appraise,&#13;
monitor, assist and evaluate state and district investment proposals.&#13;
BUILDING STATE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY&#13;
(US$7.3 MILLION OR 1.5 PERCENT OF TOTAL BASELINE PROJECT COST)&#13;
2.4           The proposed project would address the sub-sector financial and management&#13;
constraints by building state institutional capacity comprising assistance to support the:&#13;
(a) strengthening of state program management structures; (b) improvement of instructional&#13;
materials  development  and  production;  (c ) improvement  of  teaching  processes,&#13;
(d) improvement of educational planning and management, and (e) improvement of&#13;
educational research and evaluation.&#13;
2.5           Strengthening  of State  Program   Management Structures.    State&#13;
governments would implement state and district investment programs through SISs.8 These&#13;
SISs have been registered in the three new states and already operate in the seven DPEP I&#13;
8DPEP Guidelines (Annex 8) mandate the establishment of registered SISs in each state to receive, disburse&#13;
and account for program funds, to manage program implementation, and to monitor and report on progress&#13;
(Annex 6). Each implementation society is accountable to a General Council chaired by the Chief Minister or&#13;
Education Minister of the State and an Executive Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary/ Education&#13;
Secretary of the State. Membership in both bodies includes representatives from other State Government&#13;
departments and the GOI. These structures under the UPBEP and DPEP I Projects have been shown to have&#13;
administrative flexibility combined with public accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
states and Uttar Pradesh. Bank accounts with an initial deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs (US$150,000&#13;
equivalent) have been opened in all three new DPEP states.9&#13;
2.6           While there would be some variation across states, all SISs would be staffed to&#13;
carry out academic and administrative tasks related to Project implementation, including the&#13;
establishment of a Project Management Information System (PMIS) and an Education&#13;
Management Information System (EMIS) at the state level. Key staff would include the State&#13;
Project Director and Unit Heads for Civil Works, Planning and Monitoring, State Programs,&#13;
District Programs, and Finance, Monitoring and Accounting (Annex 6)10.  SISs would&#13;
implement state investment proposals and supervise district-level implementation through&#13;
AWPBs for cooperating state agencies and district implementation teams, and through&#13;
contracts for services with NGOs, consulting companies, and individuals. Full-time state&#13;
project directors have been appointed in the SISs of the three new states.&#13;
2.7           Substantial capacity for implementation has been developed in the three new&#13;
states and 12 districts that have already been appraised through preparation of district&#13;
investment proposals. To ensure rapid start-up of implementation, state governments in the&#13;
three new states have also included in their FY95/96 state budgets, earmarked funds for&#13;
DPEP, sufficient to cover first year state financing obligations. At negotiations, Project states&#13;
agreed that each Project state shall maintain state project offices (SPOs) with responsibility to&#13;
coordinate project implementation, with adequate staff, resources and facilities, and shall&#13;
establish a program of staff training satisfactory to IDA (para 5.2 (a)). Each SPO in Gujarat,&#13;
Hfimachal Pradesh, and Orissa will be staffed with a financial/procurement officer, a civil&#13;
works officer and a training specialist not later than March 31, 1997. In already participating&#13;
DPEP I states and Uttar Pradesh, the state project management structures are in place, fully&#13;
staffed and operational. The capacity of these existing SPOs to manage an expanded program&#13;
would be reviewed during the appraisal of the initial batch of expansion districts proposed for&#13;
DPEP II funding.&#13;
2.8           In support of this capacity building component of the project, the credit would&#13;
finance limited civil works, furniture and equipment, vehicles, consultant services, incremental&#13;
operating costs, and incremental salaries on a declining basis.&#13;
2.9           Improvement of Instructional Materials Development and Production.&#13;
The proposed project will assist participating states to take steps to improve the quality and&#13;
9 These SISs have been established using the model Memoranda of Association and by-laws based on those&#13;
used for the UPBEP and DPEP I Projects. This model was reviewed by IDA against managerial and legal&#13;
criteria during the appraisal of DPEP 1.  Common accounting, auditing, personnel and procurement&#13;
regulations would be adopted by all SISs (Annex 6). Financial, personnel and procurement regulations as&#13;
approved by IDA have been adopted by all SISs. An internal audit function has been established in each&#13;
society, and accounts would be audited both by an independent chartered accountant satisfactory to IDA and by&#13;
the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).&#13;
10 This working group is known as the State Project Office (SPO) in the SIS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
efficiency of instructional materials development, production and distribution"' (Annex 11).&#13;
The nature of these programs would vary depending on state conditions. However, common&#13;
elements would include: (a) preparation of a new generation of quality instructional materials&#13;
based  on  MLL; (b) field  tryout  of  instructional  materials  prior to  publication,&#13;
(c) improvements in the design, illustration, layout and durability of instructional materials,&#13;
(d) improvements in distribution efficiency including computerization of stocks; and&#13;
(e) professional training for instructional materials agency staff. Technical support would be&#13;
provided by NCERT, or equivalent organizations, to improve pedagogy. Teaching and&#13;
learning materials studies were completed in the three new states and the results will be&#13;
analyzed by the Publications Department of NCERT to guide future instructional materials&#13;
improvement efforts in DPEP II.   The credit would finance equipment, training, and&#13;
consulting services.&#13;
2.10          Improvement of Teaching Processes. With support from national technical&#13;
assistance programs, SCERTs or equivalent organizations, would strengthen their capacities&#13;
to support the development of improved classroom teaching models and teacher in-service&#13;
training. At negotiations, each Project state agreed that they will establish and maintain a&#13;
state level technical resource group to assist in the development and implementation of&#13;
programs to improve primary education teaching processes (para. 5.2(c) and Annex 10).&#13;
Strategies would usually include: (a) implementing visioning workshops to enable key&#13;
stakeholders in primary education to understand more clearly what a child-centered pedagogy&#13;
entails and what classrooms will look like by the end of the project under this new&#13;
pedagogical paradigm; (b) providing training and technical assistance to DIETs; (c) adapting&#13;
national prototype training and classroom materials in regional languages; (d) providing&#13;
training to assist teachers in the identification, assessment and teaching of children with mild&#13;
to moderate disabilities; (e) training of master trainers; (f) adapting, testing and disseminating&#13;
ECE materials; and (g) developing instructional materials in tribal languages, in cooperation&#13;
with Tribal Welfare Departments and other concerned agencies. The credit would finance&#13;
limited civil works, furniture, equipment, vehicles, consultant services, educational materials,&#13;
visioning workshops, training, fellowships, and incremental staff salaries on a declining basis.&#13;
2.11          Improvement of Educational Planning and Management.  SIEMTs, or&#13;
equivalent agencies, would be established and staffed to provide technical assistance and&#13;
training in education planning, school mapping, management and monitoring to state and&#13;
district education staff (Annexes 7 and 10). Most important would be developing the capacity&#13;
of district and sub-district level staff to manage the improved school statistics management&#13;
information system (EMIS), carry out school mapping exercises, consult with parents and&#13;
community leaders and prepare annual work programs. The credit would finance civil works,&#13;
equipment and furniture, vehicles, educational materials, consumable supplies, training,&#13;
consultant services, incremental operating costs, and salaries on a declining basis.&#13;
1 Instructional materials include textbooks, student workbooks, supplemental readers. teacher guides and&#13;
other related materials, as well as appropriate teaching and learning materials designed to assist in the&#13;
integration and mainstreaming of children with mild to moderate disabilities in primary schools.&#13;

2.12         Improvement of Educational Research and Evaluation. With training and&#13;
technical support from the national program on program evaluation, research and studies,&#13;
SCERTs would be strengthened and expanded to conduct or contract program evaluation and&#13;
research studies pertaining to the attainment of DPEP objectives, as well as the effectiveness&#13;
of the innovations implemented for such purposes (Annex 11). To carry out these studies,&#13;
Project states may consider contracting-out the services of NGOs, universities and other apex&#13;
institutions. During negotiations, Project states agreed that each Project state shall select non-&#13;
governmental and community organizations participating in the project in accordance with&#13;
criteria and procedures satisfactory to IDA (para 5.2(i)). After a start-up period, these&#13;
agencies would in turn assist DIETs to develop similar capabilities. The credit would finance&#13;
civil works, equipment and furniture, vehicles, educational materials, consumable supplies,&#13;
training, consultant services, incremental operating costs, and salaries on a declining basis.&#13;
IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF, REDUCING DROPOUT FROM, AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO&#13;
PRIMARY EDUCATION (US$483.0 MILLION OR 97.4 PERCENT OF TOTAL BASELINE&#13;
PROJECT COST)&#13;
Improving the Quality of Primary Education (US$190.1 Million Or 38.3 Percent Of Total&#13;
Baseline Project Cost)&#13;
2.13         Improving the quality and effectiveness of classroom instruction has the highest&#13;
priority in district investment planning, not only to improve leaming achievement, but also to&#13;
increase retention. The core activities under this project component are: (a) development of&#13;
district and sub-district institutional capacity to plan and manage the delivery of a range of&#13;
program activities; (b) development of training modules for teacher in-service training as the&#13;
principal means of introducing improved classroom practice, new instructional materials, and&#13;
new materials for teaching language and mathematics in early grades; (c) delivery of a&#13;
program of continuous in-service teacher training through the project period; (d) expansion of&#13;
the variety of learning materials and teaching aids in schools; (e) development and&#13;
implementation of targeted interventions for girls, children with mild to moderate disabilities,&#13;
SC and ST students; and (f) careful expansion or introduction of ECE and NFE programs&#13;
through pilot programs.&#13;
2.14         Developing District and Sub-district Institutional Capacity. The capacity&#13;
of districts and sub-districts to plan and manage program delivery to improve the quality and&#13;
expand the access to primary education would require the strengthening of: (a) district and&#13;
sub-district program management structures; and (b) District Institutes of Education and&#13;
Training (DIETs).&#13;
2.15         The day-to-day implementation would be managed by a District Project Office&#13;
(DPO) that would be directed (in most cases) by the District Education Officer (DEO). DIETs&#13;
would play a key role in the design and implementation of training programs at the district and&#13;
sub-district levels, in particular, at the block and cluster resource levels. DIETs and DEO&#13;
staff who participated in the planning teams that developed investment proposals are expected&#13;
to also play a key role in the actual implementation. The DPOs would receive advances of&#13;
funds from SISs against AWPBs approved by the state society and after review by the DPEP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
bureau. Funds would be maintained in separate accounts by the district project director and&#13;
advanced to schools and communities, as required by individual sub-projects, where they&#13;
would be maintained in separate dual-signature accounts. The above arrangement would be&#13;
implemented through local resources with IDA funds disbursed on a reimbursable basis for&#13;
expenditures incurred.&#13;
2.16         The DPO would be staffed by a small team of specialist staff appointed and&#13;
financed by the SISs. The staff would be headed by a full-time project coordinator and include&#13;
a finance/procurement officer and a specialist to coordinate the implementation of program&#13;
components in functional areas (civil works, PMIS, EMIS or training) or in areas of special&#13;
emphasis.  In addition to managing the flow of project funds to project activities and&#13;
supervising their implementation at the block, cluster, school and village level, key&#13;
responsibilities of DPO staff would be awareness building activities, school mapping,&#13;
management of the school statistics and project EMIS and preparation of AWPBs. At&#13;
negotiations, Project states have agreed that each Project state shall establish and maintain&#13;
DPOs with responsibilities to coordinate project implementation, with adequate staff,&#13;
resources and facilities, and shall establish a program of staff training satisfactory to IDA&#13;
(para. 5.2(a)). Each DPO in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, and Orissa will be staffed with a&#13;
project coordinator, a financial/procurement officer and an in-service training in-charge not&#13;
later than March 31, 1997.&#13;
2.17         At the sub-district level, DPEP would be implemented by block and cluster&#13;
level management structures including a block education office and a cluster field office.&#13;
These offices would be staffed by a few specialists appointed and financed by the SISs to&#13;
coordinate, supervise and monitor the implementation of the project. Training activities under&#13;
the project would operate at the block level through a network of Block Resource Centers&#13;
(BRCs), which would provide the facilities for decentralized training and teacher support&#13;
activities financed under the project. BRCs would be managed by a senior and experienced&#13;
upper primary school teacher and/or principal. BRC training teams would be drawn from the&#13;
faculty of DIETs, colleges and universities, and competent NGOs. Below the BRC level,&#13;
DPEP would be implemented through Cluster Resource Center (CRCs, each comprising a&#13;
lead primary school serving a group of about 10 to 15 primary schools). These clusters would&#13;
provide continuous support to primary school teachers within the cluster through classroom&#13;
visits and short meetings and pedagogical discussions at the lead school. Continuous support&#13;
would be supplemented by periodic residential training at the BRCs, with trainers drawn from&#13;
DIETs. A senior and experienced primary school teacher would be assigned to serve as the&#13;
cluster resource teacher.&#13;
2.18         At the village level, DPEP would be implemented through district-level bodies,&#13;
including the Panchayati Raj structures and the Village Education Committees (VECs). They&#13;
would play an increasingly important role in educational management, supervision and&#13;
monitoring at the village/school level. The constitution of VECs is more or less similar across&#13;
states and includes the gaon panchayat president, head teachers, headmasters, NGO&#13;
representatives, members of panchayat, and representatives of parents/guardians of the village.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Seats are earmarked for women representatives. At negotiations, Project states agreed that in&#13;
the case of the 12 appraised Project districts in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa, VECs&#13;
shall be established in Project districts no later than June 30, 1997, and in the case of Project&#13;
districts for which investment proposals for financing project activities have not yet been&#13;
approved, VECs shall be established in Project districts within one year after the Borrower has&#13;
granted approval to their investment proposals (paras. 2.35 and 5.2(f)).&#13;
2.19         In support of district and sub-district level capacity development, the credit&#13;
would finance limited civil works, vehicles, equipment (including computer equipment for the&#13;
EMIS), educational materials, consumable supplies, training, consultant services, incremental&#13;
operating costs and salaries on a declining basis.&#13;
2.20         District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs) would be developed as&#13;
the principal technical and professional resource agency for training, materials development,&#13;
planning and management for district plans and work programs (Annexes 10 and 11). The&#13;
work of the DIETs would be supported by State Councils of Educational Research and&#13;
Training (SCERT) and/or other expert resource groups. The GOI has recognized that the&#13;
standard model for DIET organization, staffing and equipment needs to be adapted to the&#13;
support requirements of DPEP, especially in regard to primary in-service teacher training. In&#13;
addition, in some states, substantial enhancement of DIET physical facilities would be needed.&#13;
The credit would finance civil works in selected DIETS, equipment, vehicles, consultant&#13;
services, educational materials, consumable supplies, incremental operating expenses and&#13;
salaries on a declining basis. At negotiations, Project states agreed that each Project state&#13;
shall establish and maintain DIETs or equivalent institutions in Project districts and appoint&#13;
key staff at such DIETs or equivalent institutions in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to&#13;
1DA, in any event not later than six months after the approval by the DPEP Bureau of any&#13;
investment proposal for financing project activities in a Projeci district (para. 5.2(b) and&#13;
Annex 10).&#13;
2.21         In-Service Teacher Training. Most of the little in-service training that has&#13;
been provided to primary teachers before the implementation of DPEP I had been delivered&#13;
through residential programs of limited scope, often as a means of implementing standardized,&#13;
nationally/state-developed "packages" focused on a limited range of competencies. DPEP is&#13;
seeking to transform India's approach to in-service training by developing the training systems&#13;
and infrastructure needed to make training a continuous process based in classrooms and&#13;
schools.&#13;
2.22         Three core activities are being implemented under DPEP I to establish the new&#13;
in-service training systems: (a) development of initial modules and systems for training&#13;
trainers, teachers and school principals, based on the results of the new pedagogy visioning&#13;
exercises carried out at the state level with primary education stakeholders; (b) development&#13;
of the physical infrastructure needed to bring training to the block and school cluster levels;&#13;
and. (c) expansion of training modules and materials to incorporate MLL instructional&#13;
materials, teaching and leaming materials for the integration of children with disabilities into&#13;
the primary schools and a variety of effective classroom and school management and&#13;
leadership practices.  DPEP II includes a fine-tuned version of these core activities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
incorporating lessons learned from the implementation of UPBEP, DPEP I and experimental&#13;
teacher training programs implemented in several states with UNICEF assistance. Teachers in&#13;
DPEP districts would be provided with approximately 25 days of training, preferably at the&#13;
block level, throughout the life of the project, reinforced by monthly meetings/workshops at&#13;
the cluster level and school visits by cluster resource teachers.&#13;
2.23         Key to the success of the program  is the development of good training&#13;
materials and the training of effective master trainers and resource persons. Prototype training&#13;
designs and materials for school-based in-service training are being developed and tested in&#13;
several states by the Department of Teacher Education at NCERT and other resource&#13;
institutions for DPEP I and other primary education projects.  Several other states may&#13;
develop their own training materials. Through the national program to improve in-service&#13;
training, these materials would be further developed and provided to state agencies as&#13;
prototypes during the first year of the project. This generation of materials is expected to&#13;
build teacher awareness and motivation for alternative classroom practices and develop further&#13;
training strategies for enriching the learning environment. They may include an introduction&#13;
to child-centered teaching and active learning methods, applications in multigrade settings and&#13;
possibilities for teacher preparation of teaching aids. These materials may be adapted as&#13;
needed and translated into regional languages. With the assistance of the national program,&#13;
master trainer programs would be developed to train DIET faculty and other teacher&#13;
educators. Master training teams would test materials and approaches on a trial basis in&#13;
districts using the facilities of DIETs and Teacher Training Institutes.&#13;
2.24         To provide the training infrastructure, districts would construct, equip and staff&#13;
Teacher Resource Centers at the block level and in simple CRCs, each serving about 10 to 15&#13;
schools. Construction of these facilities would be completed by the second year of the&#13;
project. Facilities would be staffed by experienced primary teachers, in some cases retirees,&#13;
who would receive induction training with initial master trainer materials. In-service teacher&#13;
training in participating DPEP districts would start in the second year of project&#13;
implementation and would incorporate the first generation of training materials described&#13;
above. In later years, additional training modules would be developed with technical support&#13;
from DIETs and SCERTs, with priority given to multigrade teaching, teaching of reading and&#13;
mathematics, using new MILL in the instructional materials as they become available, the use&#13;
of supplementary materials and teacher preparation of educational aids. SCERTs and the&#13;
National Teacher Training Resource Group would cooperate throughout the process to&#13;
identify best practices and innovations for dissemination throughout India.  Master trainers&#13;
and resource persons would participate in refresher training as new training modules are&#13;
developed and introduced.&#13;
2.25         The proposed credit would finance civil works, equipment, furniture, vehicles,&#13;
training, consulting services, educational materials, consumable supplies, incremental&#13;
operating costs, and salaries for block and cluster staff on a declining basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
2.26         Learning Materials and Teaching Aids. Evaluations of OBB have shown&#13;
the weaknesses of delivering pre-determined packages of teaching aids to schools, without&#13;
training and without involvement of teachers and local education staff. Under DPEP, districts&#13;
would instead provide annual grants to school/community organizations for the purchase of&#13;
consumable supplies and materials. Grants of Rs. 2000 would be authorized initially and the&#13;
amounts would be reviewed periodically by the DPEP Bureau. In addition, annual grants of&#13;
Rs. 500 would be made to each primary teacher in Project districts to purchase materials to&#13;
use in preparing teaching aids. Schools and teachers would keep records and receipts for&#13;
purchases. In-service training in the development of teaching aids would be provided.  In&#13;
addition to these annual grants, the program would provide funding for the development and&#13;
production of supplementary instructional materials, the establishment of small libraries and&#13;
book banks (for example, for poor boys who are not covered under existing free book&#13;
schemes) in schools in Project districts. Special allocations may be considered for materials&#13;
purchased for one- and two-classroom schools.&#13;
2.27         Targeted Interventions for Children with Mild to Moderate Disabilities,&#13;
Girls, SC and ST Students. The project will provide for integrated education of children&#13;
with mild to moderate disabilities in primary schools in Project districts. To achieve this aim,&#13;
the project will finance the development and implementation of strategies to assist primary&#13;
school teachers in Project districts in the identification and assessment of such children, as&#13;
well as in the provision of programs and appropriate teaching and learning materials designed&#13;
to ensure the effective mainstreaming of these children in primary schools. In the case of girls,&#13;
SC and ST students, social assessment studies investigating the key constraints on education&#13;
for girls and ST students were completed by project appraisal for two districts in each one of&#13;
the three new states (Annex 15).  The revised versions of such studies comprising the&#13;
recommendations made during the appraisal mission were proviled by DOE/GOI to IDA&#13;
prior to negotiations. The findings of these studies would be discussed with state and district&#13;
planning teams during the first year of the project. On the basis of these discussions,&#13;
integrated intervention strategies would be adjusted during implementation of the project. At&#13;
negotiations, Project states agreed that each Project state shall: (i) implement the project in&#13;
accordance with strategies acceptable to IDA for improving primary education of female&#13;
students; (ii) implement the project in any tribal area (as designated by such state in&#13;
accordance with applicable laws), in accordance with procedures and delivery strategies&#13;
satisfactory to IDA; and (iii) ensure that all investments in Project districts which are classified&#13;
by the Borrower as tribal districts, or which include blocks classified by the Borrower as tribal&#13;
blocks, are appraised and implemented in accordance with a plan, satisfactory to IDA, for the&#13;
delivery of project benefits to tribal people (paras. 3.41 and 5.2(e)).&#13;
2.28         Some DPEP I states have been proposing a variety of activities to improve&#13;
learning achievement for girls, including gender review of curricula and instructional materials&#13;
and teacher sensitization through training (Annex 15). ECE programs would also contribute&#13;
(Para. 2.3 1). Scholarship programs for SC students, especially girls and disabled children, are&#13;
operating in several of the DPEP I Project states. These programs would not be financed by&#13;
the proposed credit but would continue with state financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
2.29         Implementing national policy on education for tribal children would require&#13;
measures to ensure that they have equitable access to basic education services, as well as&#13;
enhanced efforts to develop materials in tribal languages and to develop strategies to increase&#13;
the ability of teachers in tribal areas to teach in the language of the home. District proposals&#13;
have primarily emphasized the establishment of residential schools (Ashrams) for tribal&#13;
children in order to overcome the constraints caused by the small size and the geographic&#13;
isolation of many tribal communities. Establishment of a limited number of these schools will&#13;
be supported by DPEP where community demand can be demonstrated and evaluations of&#13;
similar schools provide evidence of their effectiveness.&#13;
2.30         For these targeted interventions, the proposed credit would finance educational&#13;
materials, consumable supplies, training, and consultant services.  The credit would also&#13;
finance civil works, furniture and equipment for residential schools that may be approved by&#13;
IDA in accordance with para. 2.29 above. At negotiations, Project states agreed that each&#13;
Project state shall allocate project resources for the education of tribal students at least in&#13;
proportion to the share of the tribal population in the relevant Project district (para. 5.2(d)).&#13;
2.31         Selected Expansion of Early Childhood Education (ECE). ECE is an&#13;
important DPEP strategy to improve readiness to learn, especially for children from illiterate&#13;
households. ECE is also expected to contribute to enrollment and retention for girls by&#13;
providing an alternative source of sibling care during school hours. ECE is provided in all&#13;
Project states by the integrated child development scheme (ICDS). National evaluations have&#13;
found that participation in the ICDS program improves retention in primary school. However,&#13;
the timings of schools and ICDS Anganwadi Centers, which provide ECE and supplementary&#13;
nutrition rarely match, reducing the potential contributions of the program for sibling care. In&#13;
addition, Anganwadi Centers serve a population of 1000; this catchment area can include as&#13;
many as three schools, only one of which is likely to be located within easy walking distance.&#13;
Moreover, ICDS coverage is not universal in any state, and in some, like Assam, coverage is&#13;
very low. Finally, the ECE component of ICDS is unevenly implemented across the districts,&#13;
raising concerns for quality.&#13;
2.32         Because of these factors, districts have proposed to expand or establish ECE&#13;
programs for the 0 to 6 age group, often on a large scale. Existing programs have rarely been&#13;
evaluated systematically, and new programs would involve the creation of materials, training&#13;
and supervision systems, and facilities.  For these reasons, the GOI would require that&#13;
expanded and new ECE programs be first developed and tested on a pilot basis with&#13;
concurrent evaluations.  Proposals for ECE pilot programs and evaluations would be&#13;
considered by the DPEP Bureau for financing, beginning with the second year of the project.&#13;
The proposed credit would finance educational materials, consurr.mble supplies, training and&#13;
consultant services, furniture and equipment, salaries on a declining basis and limited civil&#13;
works.&#13;

Reducing Dropout from and Expanding Access to Primary Education (US$292.9 Million or&#13;
59.0 Percent of Total Baseline Project Cost)&#13;
2.33         To improve the student access to and retention in primary education, the&#13;
proposed project will support the: (a) strengthening of school/community organizations;&#13;
(b) construction of new classrooms and improvement of existing school facilities;&#13;
(c) development of alternative schooling modalities; and (d) carrying-out of awareness&#13;
campaigns focused particularly on girls, children with disabilities, SC and ST students.&#13;
2.34         Strengthening  of  School/Community  Organizations.    All  states&#13;
participating in DPEP I have established schooUcommunity organizations as called for under&#13;
the Revised National Policy on Education (1992). These organizations, variously known as&#13;
Village Education Committees (VEC), Parent-Teacher Associations, or School Management&#13;
Committees, are expected to oversee the operations of schools and NFE centers, conduct&#13;
annual surveys of village children to identify non-enrollees and dropouts, contribute services&#13;
and resources to the school and encourage parents to send their children to school and keep&#13;
them there. These organizations function with varying degrees of effectiveness. In Kerala and&#13;
Maharashtra, with long traditions of community involvement in schools, they meet regularly&#13;
and are effective in their tasks. In other states, surveys show that they meet infrequently and&#13;
are less effective.&#13;
2.35         States have defined the functions of community/school organizations and their&#13;
membership, including reserving at least one third of all places for women. To improve&#13;
effectiveness, states and districts would provide training and supervision support. Depending&#13;
on local circumstances, additional activities, such as micro-planning and awareness campaigns&#13;
may be entrusted to these organizations. During negotiations, Project states agreed that they&#13;
will establish and maintain VECs with responsibility for assisting with project implementation&#13;
at the village level (paras. 2.18 and 5.2(f)).&#13;
2.36         The proposed credit would finance training, educational materials and&#13;
consumable supplies for strengthening community/school organizations.&#13;
2.37         Construction of New Classrooms and Improvement of Existing School&#13;
Facilities. Although reducing dropout and . improving learning achievement would have&#13;
priority under DPEP, the program would also finance expanded access through the&#13;
construction of new schools and classrooms. Provision for water and waste disposal at&#13;
classroom sites will be fully integrated into the school construction program. Approximately&#13;
850,000 new places would be created with the construction of about 21,100 classrooms&#13;
financed by the proposed project in all Project states. Furthermore, the project would finance&#13;
the repair of another 13,900 classrooms. Construction would be mostly undertaken by&#13;
communities and state construction agencies (Annex 13). At negotiations, Project states&#13;
agreed that the number of classrooms to be constructed and the number of teachers to be&#13;
appointed under the project shall be determined based on the projected number of students&#13;
expected to be served in accordance with state-specific criteria, including for sparsely&#13;
populated areas (para. 5.2(g)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
2.38         The credit would finance civil works, furniture and equipment, and, on a&#13;
declining basis, the salaries of about 20,700 additional teachers required in new facilities in all&#13;
DPEP II states. The credit would also finance, on a declining basis, the salaries of new&#13;
teachers required by enrollment expansion resulting from project activities. The need for these&#13;
latter appointments would be documented by each district on the basis of initial enrollments on&#13;
a school-by-school basis, and would be authorized by DPEP from the third year of the&#13;
proposed project. New teacher posts in schools not constructed or expanded with project&#13;
financing would be eligible for financing from the third year of the project only on the basis of&#13;
evidence of school enrollment increases provided by states. The dilapidated condition of a&#13;
large proportion of rural schools, combined with the absence of toilets and water supply, often&#13;
makes school an unattractive place, especially for girls. Repair and rehabilitation of existing&#13;
schools, along with the installation of toilets, water supply, and electricity, are expected to&#13;
make a major and visible contribution to the quality of services, and hence to increased&#13;
retention in schools. These civil works programs would be implemented by community/school&#13;
organizations and block-level public works departments (Annex 13). The proposed credit&#13;
would finance school water and sanitation civil works in about 20,350 schools in all DPEP II&#13;
states, including equipment, costs of electricity connections, and professional services as well&#13;
as funds needed during the life of the project for the maintenance of all buildings and&#13;
equipment provided by the project.&#13;
2.39         School construction undertaken so far with the support of UPBEP and DPEP I&#13;
has used traditional building technologies and little progress has been made to develop more&#13;
cost-effective designs and reduce the unit cost of the buildings. Throughout the country there&#13;
are many reputable agencies specializing in alternative building technologies and cost effective&#13;
construction techniques. To assist the states to undertake research, experimentation and&#13;
evaluation of alternative, 'low cost" techniques for construction of school facilities, a Rs. 50&#13;
lakh School Construction Innovation Fund would be established in each Project state. This&#13;
Innovation Fund would be utilized in part to finance design work though a collaborative effort&#13;
involving consultant architects, regional polytechnics, educationalists, and state construction&#13;
agencies. The fund would also finance the actual construction of prototype designs in&#13;
communities covered by the DPEP II project. Initially, the construction of these prototype&#13;
schools would be a parallel activity to the ongoing construction of more traditional designs&#13;
during the early stages of the DPEP II implementation period. However, once an evaluation&#13;
has been made of successful, replicable techniques in the prototype schools, it is expected that&#13;
these alternative methods of construction would be incorporated into the school construction&#13;
program during the remaining project period.&#13;
2.40         Development of Alternative Schooling Modalities.  The proposed credit&#13;
would also support the establishment of non-formal primary classes as alternatives to formal&#13;
schooling for isolated small communities and for working children, and support the design and&#13;
trial of other means to ensure improved access to primary schools in the rural areas, such as&#13;
Ashram (residential) schools, escort services and peripatetic teachers. The construction of&#13;
new classrooms and the refurbishment of existing ones in all DPEP II states would provide&#13;
access to formal and non-formal instruction to approximately one million additional children&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
per year after project completion. States and districts would not be required to follow the&#13;
norms of the present GOI-funded NFE program, but would be encouraged to develop locally-&#13;
specific options and strategies, including those that would involve NGOs in service delivery.&#13;
2.41        Carrying-out Awareness Campaigns Focused Particularly on Children&#13;
with Mild to Moderate Disabilities, Girls, SC and ST Students. Popular participation in&#13;
the development of district investment proposals has raised awareness among beneficiaries of&#13;
impending improvements in the quality of schooling. Building from this base, a variety of&#13;
awareness building activities -- campaigns, community meetings, fairs -- would be undertaken&#13;
to increase awareness of the program and the benefits to communities and schools. Emphasis&#13;
would be given to the importance of integrating into primary school children with disabilities,&#13;
and keeping in school all other children, especially girls, SC and ST students. The proposed&#13;
credit would finance educational materials, supplies, and consultant services.&#13;
DISTANCE EDUCATION PROGRAM (US$4.3 MILLION OR 0.9 PERCENT OF TOTAL&#13;
BASELINE PROJECT COST)&#13;
2.42         The Distance Education Component proposed for DPEP II will be a&#13;
decentralized effort to support the ongoing in-service teacher and other training activities&#13;
currently being carried out by the different states under DPEP I (Annex 12). The distance&#13;
education approach will help design and deliver tailor-made materials and programs which&#13;
address the cultural and curricular diversity of the participating DPEP states. The proposed&#13;
project will assist the capacity building effort by DOE/GOI to develop competencies at the&#13;
state level to write in-service teacher and other training scripts and to produce, integrate and&#13;
disseminate distance education materials in the training activities.  Implementation of this&#13;
component would be managed by a small core team of distance clucation experts from the&#13;
Indira Gandhi National Open University, or similar organizations, and consultants.&#13;
2.43        The decentralized, state-service based approach of the Distance Education&#13;
Component would include the following activities: (a) developing annual workplans with each&#13;
DPEP state for the required distance education efforts; (b) conducting annual distance&#13;
education planning meetings in each state to review progress and prepare plans for the coming&#13;
year; (c) preparing materials for workshops in each DPEP state including the development of&#13;
video, radio, and printed material; (d) supporting each state distance education planning,&#13;
training and materials development activity with expert support to provide hands on training&#13;
and advice; (e) assisting DPEP states in the financing of the actual production of print, audio&#13;
and video educational materials; (f) training of persons at various levels in the appropriate use&#13;
of distance education materials; and (g) providing institutions involved in the delivery of&#13;
DPEP supported training programs with distance education video and audio equipment, such&#13;
as VCR and tape recorders and other equipment as appropriate. A revised version of the&#13;
distance education component comprising the recommendations made during the appraisal&#13;
mission was provided to IDA by DOE/GOI prior to negotiations. At negotiations, GOI&#13;
agreed that it will establish and maintain a Distance Education Unit with adequate staff and&#13;
resources to be responsible for implementing the Distance Education Program under the&#13;
project (para. 5.1(g)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
2.44         This component has neither planned satellite-delivered distance education&#13;
activities nor provided funds for satellite teleconferencing outreach. However, where such&#13;
facilities do exist in India, the distance learning component of the proposed project will make&#13;
use of such communication links to manage, coordinate or train when the use of such&#13;
technologies can effectively substitute for staff travel and face-to-face meetings.&#13;
2.45        The credit would finance technical assistance, training, consultant services,&#13;
equipment, workshops, study tours, production of distance education materials, consumable&#13;
supplies, office rental, and salaries on a declining basis.&#13;
NATIONAL MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE SUPPORT FOR DPEP (US$1.4 MILLION OR 0.3&#13;
PERCENT OF TOTAL BASELINE PROJECT COST)&#13;
2.46         The innovative nature of DPEP requires a national management structure with&#13;
good policy access, substantial authority, a high degree of flexibility in appointing staff and&#13;
consultants, strong professional competence, and access to good information on program&#13;
activities, accomplishments and problems. DPEP II implementation will be integrated with&#13;
DPEP I and carried out by the national program management organization established under&#13;
DPEP I, including the DPEP Bureau of DOE/GOI and related governing and support bodies.&#13;
2.47         The DPEP General Council reviews policies and progress annually, provides&#13;
policy direction, and facilitates center-state coordination. The DPEP Project Board has been&#13;
established and is fully empowered to decide program, financial and staffing approvals (Annex&#13;
6). The DPEP Bureau will continue to serve as an intermediary organization and appraise,&#13;
finance and supervise the implementation of state and district investment plans according to&#13;
established criteria and procedures. It would be assisted by a technical support group (TSG)&#13;
and a national core team of experts made up of faculty from NCERT and NIEPA, staff of&#13;
other public and private sector resource institutions, and consultants to conduct specific&#13;
project related studies and to provide technical training and support to national, state and&#13;
district planning teams. Much of this expert support is provided through an umbrella contract&#13;
with a consultant firm specialized in the provision of education consultant services. Through&#13;
this contract, the DPEP Bureau has acquired substantial flexibility with respect to appointment&#13;
of temporary staff and consultants, including levels of remuneration.  Through the&#13;
implementation of DPEP I, GOI and partner institutions have gained the experience needed to&#13;
conduct large scale field research in primary education, assist states and districts with the&#13;
preparation of their investment proposals, and carry out the appraisals of such proposals.&#13;
DPEP II will finance the national management structure only in the last year of project&#13;
implementation, at the time when the DPEP I Credit will be closed.&#13;
2.48        The DPEP Bureau, headed by a Joint Secretary, is responsible to the Project&#13;
Board and General Council for the implementation of the program within DPEP Guidelines&#13;
(Annex 8). The DPEP Bureau has the responsibility and authority to appraise, supervise and&#13;
evaluate district, state and national investment plans and to approve staff appointments to the&#13;
program technical services. The structure of the DPEP Bureau remains as agreed for DPEP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
and is fully explained in Annex 6. On the whole the DPEP Bureau has effectively managed&#13;
the implementation of DPEP I although staffing shortages have, on occasion, slowed down&#13;
the start-up activities. DOE has appointed well-qualified and experienced staff to the Bureau&#13;
but the number remains below the level agreed for DPEP I. The workload of the DPEP&#13;
Bureau is expected to increase rapidly as implementation of DPEP I is now accelerating, and&#13;
implementation of DPEP II will involve, in addition to the implementation responsibilities&#13;
carried by the Bureau for DPEP I, the appraisal of 50 to 60 expansion districts in DPEP I&#13;
states and Uttar Pradesh, and up to 3 more districts in the three new states. To meet these&#13;
demands, the current staffing of the DPEP Bureau needs to be strengthened. At negotiations,&#13;
GOI agreed that it will maintain the DPEP Bureau in its DOE, with responsibility to&#13;
coordinate project implementation, with adequate staff, resources and facilities (para. 5. l(a)).&#13;
All positions at the level of Joint Secretary and Deputy Secretary shall be filled no later than&#13;
March 31, 1997.&#13;
2.49         The  full-time senior technical and  professional experts on  contract,&#13;
supplemented as needed by short-term consultants, provide the DPEP Bureau with key&#13;
technical services needed for program management in the areas of: (a) appraisal for state and&#13;
district investment plans; (b) supervision of project implementation, including civil works and&#13;
procurement; (c) monitoring and reporting on DPEP inputs, physical targets, and&#13;
implementation progress; and (d) establishing and monitoring research and evaluation&#13;
contracts with research organizations and individual consultants (Annex 6). Some&#13;
strengthening of the long term consultant staff of the TSG may be required however to ensure&#13;
a timely and effective assistance in the implementation of DPEP I district and state investment&#13;
proposals, appraising of incoming districts under DPEP II, and the monitoring of the early&#13;
stages (first 12 to 18 months) of the DPEP II implementation process.  A plan for&#13;
strengthening the TSG was provided to IDA by DOE/GOI prior to negotiations. At&#13;
negotiations, GOI agreed that it will maintain the TSG in its DOE, with responsibility to&#13;
coordinate project implementation, with adequate staff, resources and facilities (para. 5.1(a)).&#13;
All positions at the level of Joint Secretary and Deputy Secretary shall be filled no later than&#13;
March 31, 1997.&#13;
2.50         As states participating in DPEP gain experience and state level planning and&#13;
management capacity develops, the focus of the implementation support of the DPEP Bureau&#13;
and the TSG can increasingly be on the states, that have recently joined DPEP. At the same&#13;
time the expansion of the coverage of DPEP makes it imperative to transfer some of the&#13;
DPEP Bureau and TSG tasks -- especially the appraisal of district AWPBs and the technical&#13;
support to district planning teams -- to the states. The experience gained by the state project&#13;
offices (SPO) and other state level institutions with the implementation of DPEP I and&#13;
UPBEP ensures that this can be done without affecting implementation quality. At&#13;
negotiations, GOI agreed that it will progressively transfer responsibility for supervision of the&#13;
project from the DPEP Bureau to the SPOs in accordance with a plan satisfactory to IDA&#13;
(para. 5.1(b)). This transfer will commence not later than April 1, 1997 by transfer of the&#13;
responsibility for Project Supervision to the SPO for at least one Project State.&#13;
2.51         DPEP II will continue the flow of funds arrangements agreed for DPEP I.&#13;
Under this arrangement, the total project costs will be shared between the GOI and the state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
in the ratio of about 85:15 (GOI:State). Advances from the GOI resources to state societies&#13;
would be made twice annually on the basis of district and state AWPBs prepared and&#13;
appraised previously and evidence of appropriate use of previously advanced funds. During&#13;
negotiations, GOI agreed that it will ensure that SISs receive project funds out of the&#13;
Borrower's resources on a six monthly basis, in a timely manner, for anticipated expenditures&#13;
under their approved annual work plans (paras 3.57 and 5. 1(f)).&#13;
2.52         DPEP II will benefit from the experience gained by the DPEP Bureau, its TSG&#13;
and national expert teams in: (a) improving the school statistics EMIS; (b) developing the&#13;
teacher in-service training; (c) building a capacity for evaluation and research; (d) developing&#13;
and introducing an improved pedagogy; (e) providing technical assistance and training to&#13;
states and districts in educational planning and management; (f) developing ST educational&#13;
strategies; and (g) establishing an innovation facility fund.&#13;
2.53         School Statistics EMIS. Improving the accuracy and timeliness of school&#13;
statistics has high priority for monitoring the impact of DPEP reforms. DPEP II will build on&#13;
the work completed earlier under DPEP I to develop core specifications for computerized&#13;
EMIS systems for adaptation by states and prototype training courses for use in implementing&#13;
the new system at national, state and district levels. DPEP II will ensure that state-specific&#13;
systems are compatible with the proposed EMIS.&#13;
2.54         Development of Teacher In-Service Training.  States and districts face&#13;
massive in-service training requirements without organized access to best practices in India&#13;
and elsewhere. Some prototype materials and training designs have been developed by&#13;
NCERT and other resource institutions under DPEP I financing, and are being made available&#13;
to states for adaptation and translation into regional languages (Annex 10). Other materials&#13;
are being developed against the results of the visioning workshops concerning the new&#13;
pedagogy carried out in some DPEP I states. NCERT has undertaken the following activities&#13;
in collaboration with state agencies and DIETS to assist states to improve classroom teaching&#13;
through in-service training: (a) identification of best practices in in-service teacher training in&#13;
India, including the evaluation of designs and materials and the dissemination of selected&#13;
models to states; (b) development of field-tested prototype teacher in-service training designs&#13;
and materials; and (c) provision of technical assistance to the states in the development of&#13;
capacity for adapting prototype training designs and materials for developing state and&#13;
district-specific designs and materials, and for conducting formative evaluation activities&#13;
aimed at improving in-service courses.  In addition, some states have contracted NGOs or&#13;
state agencies to develop training modules and teaching materials. Complementing the above&#13;
activities, the distance education component to be carried out under DPEP II financing will&#13;
support the ongoing in-service teacher training activities of DPEP (paras 2.42 to 2.45).&#13;
2.55         Program Evaluation and Research. The DPEP Bureau has contracted with&#13;
NCERT to: (a) improve the educational research and evaluation capacity of national and state&#13;
research organizations; (b) organize international conferences and study tours on primary&#13;
education research and evaluation; (c) conduct or commission systematic studies and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
evaluations in primary education, including the relative strengths of supply and demand-type&#13;
interventions; and (d) disseminate the results of studies through reports, seminars and&#13;
newsletters. In addition, the TSG has the capacity to supervise survey research and carry out&#13;
thematic evaluation studies. This arrangement will be continued under DPEP II for the three&#13;
new states and Uttar Pradesh. Under DPEP I, GOI has agreed to provide a revised plan to&#13;
IDA for review, including terms of reference for the implementation of the national technical&#13;
assistance program designed to accelerate the national capacity building process in DPEP I&#13;
states.&#13;
2.56        Program  for Improved Pedagogy.  DPEP I is financing the following&#13;
activities aimed at improving classroom pedagogy: (a) carrying-out visioning workshops to&#13;
enable key stakeholders in primary education to understand more clearly what a child-centered&#13;
pedagogy entails and what classrooms will look like by the end of the project under this new&#13;
pedagogical paradigm; (b) identifying best teaching practices within India, comprising the&#13;
assembling of learning materials and information on pedagogical practices and the&#13;
dissemination of best practices to states through publications, seminars and training programs;&#13;
(c) accessing international research on teaching primary reading and mathematics&#13;
competencies, as well as effective multigrade teaching, through journals and participation in&#13;
international conferences and seminars and disseminating new approaches through the same&#13;
channels; (d) conducting research on reading readiness of children entering grade 1 and on&#13;
specific reading difficulties of children in grades I and 2, including the analysis of achievement&#13;
test scores to identify competencies on which student performance is weak; (e) developing&#13;
research-based, field-tested prototype packages of instructional materials, auxiliary learning&#13;
materials and teacher guides based on MILL and integrated and active learning techniques for&#13;
reading and mathematics skills development in the early primary grades; (f) providing&#13;
technical assistance to states and districts for the implementation of improved pedagogy in&#13;
relation to MILL; and (g) improving the design, layout and production of textbooks and&#13;
teaching/learning materials, including the provision of training and technical consulting&#13;
services to assist with capacity building for textbook and learning material development and&#13;
publication in state agencies. The start-up of these activities has been slower than expected,&#13;
partly because of the need to integrate them with the capacity building program supported by&#13;
the European Community, but a start has been made in several areas and training of&#13;
professionals on pedagogy and education research and evaluation methods is expected to start&#13;
in 1996.&#13;
2.57         Technical Assistance  and  Training  in  Educational Planning  and&#13;
Management. DPEP I and UPBEP are financing a team of experts drawn from NIEPA and&#13;
other resource institutions to assist state planning and management units/institutions to&#13;
develop competencies in the following areas through technical assistance and training:&#13;
(a) compilation of education statistics; (b) district and sub-district level planning, including&#13;
civil works, intervention design, costing and implementation planning; and (c) implementation&#13;
of state and district school statistics information systems. Training of professionals in this area&#13;
is expected to start in 1996 under the EC assisted program.&#13;
2.58         ST Education Development. DPEP I is assisting NCERT, NIEPA and other&#13;
resource institutions to conduct a number of studies of tribal education (Annexes 10 and 15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
These efforts have been intensified and expanded to improve the implementation of national&#13;
policy for ST education. This work involves various state institutions, such as the Tribal&#13;
Research Institute in Assam and the Indian Institute of Languages in Karnataka, as well as&#13;
Tribal Welfare Departments, in order to take advantage of existing expertise and local&#13;
knowledge. The lessons from experience in planning and implementing these programs are&#13;
being shared between states in a series of national workshops.&#13;
2.59         Innovation Facility Fund. States have proposed a number of innovative but&#13;
un-tested approaches to improve primary education, including new cost-effective construction&#13;
designs (para. 3.37).  In addition, a number of core intervention strategies, including ECE,&#13;
would require pilot testing prior to adoption and replication. Other innovations have been&#13;
emerging during the DPEP I implementation. Lessons learned from the implementation of&#13;
these innovations will be considered in the execution of DPEP II. P. GOs are already involved&#13;
in DPEP in a variety of ways, including innovative activities, work with women's groups and&#13;
the carrying out of non-formal education programs financed under DPEP. A facility called the&#13;
"Fund for Innovations" has been managed by the DPEP Bureau under DPEP I financing in&#13;
accordance with the DPEP Guidelines, which appraises proposals from states and districts and&#13;
commissions independent evaluation studies through the national program of research and&#13;
evaluation. Innovation funds have been established with SISs (approximately US$60,000&#13;
annually) and district implementation teams (approximately US$3,000 annually). At&#13;
negotiations, GOI agreed that the DPEP Bureau shall approve innovative activities under the&#13;
program evaluation and research component financed by the project as part of the DPEP&#13;
Bureau's review of the annual work programs of states (para. 5.1(h)).&#13;

IH. PROJECT COST, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.1              Summary of Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at Rs. 23,563.7&#13;
million or US$534.4 million equivalent including taxes and duties estimated at US$20.6&#13;
million equivalent. The direct and indirect foreign exchange cost is also estimated at US$20.6&#13;
million.   The project would  finance civil works, furniture, equipment, vehicles, teaching&#13;
materials, consultant services, information campaigns, training, workshops and fellowships.&#13;
The project would also finance operational expenses, maintenance of vehicles and equipment&#13;
purchased with project funds, honoraria to non-salaried workers involved primarily with non-&#13;
formal educational programs, and salaries of incremental staff, all on a declining basis. Details&#13;
of cost estimates, the financing plan, procurement arrangements and disbursement plans are&#13;
shown in Annex 2.&#13;
3.2              The breakdown of project costs by components and categories of expenditure&#13;

3.4                Customs Duties and Taxes.  All imported goods are subject to customs&#13;
duties and taxes. The estimated cost of the project includes import duties and taxes valued at&#13;
about US$20.6 million equivalent.&#13;
3.5                Foreign Exchange Component. The estimated foreign exchange component&#13;
of US$20.6 million is calculated on the basis of estimated foreign exchange proportions as&#13;
follows: (a) civil works 9%; (b) equipment 25%; (c) book and library materials 5%; (d) locally&#13;
manufactured vehicles 25%; (e) incremental operating costs 5%; and (f) equipment&#13;
maintenance 5%.&#13;
&#13;

3.6         Contingency  Allowances.   Estimated project costs included physical&#13;
contingencies (US$40.0 million) estimated at 10% for civil works and all physical&#13;
components, and 5% for all salaries, technical assistance, training and maintenance items. The&#13;
estimated costs of the project also include price contingencies (-US$1.6 million) to account&#13;
for expected price escalation at the following rates:&#13;
Foreign    2.3% in CY1997            Local      8.0% in CY1997&#13;
Costs      2.5% in CY 1998           Costs      7.5% in CY 1998&#13;
2.5% in CY 1999                     7.0% in CY 1999&#13;
2.5% in CY2000                      6.0% in CY2000&#13;
2.5% in CY2001                      6.0% in CY2001&#13;
2.4% in CY2002                      6.0% in CY2002&#13;
B. Financing Plan&#13;
3.7         The project would be financed by an IDA Credit of US$425.2 million; it is also&#13;
anticipated that the Government of the Netherlands (GON) would provide DPEP II with a&#13;
grant of US$25.8 million. The IDA portion of the financing arrangements amount to about&#13;
82.8 percent of the total project costs net of taxes. The combined contributions of IDA and&#13;
GON would amount to 87.8 percent of the total project costs net of taxes. The Government&#13;
of India, through the governments of Project states, would finance the remaining costs of&#13;
US$62.8 million plus all taxes and duties (US$20.6 million).&#13;
3.8         The credit would be made available to GOI on stardard terms and conditions&#13;
and made available to the Project states as a grant.&#13;
C. State Investment Capacity, Additionality and&#13;
Recurrent Cost Implications&#13;
3.9         The DPEP Guidelines require participating states to adhere to three financial&#13;
conditions: (a) states will contribute around 15 percent of the total cost; (b) program&#13;
resources will be a net addition to state expenditure on elementary education which must at&#13;
least be maintained at real 1995/96 levels; and (c) the annual recurrent costs of the project are&#13;
to be sustainable on state non plan budgets at the end of the period (Annex 14). These&#13;
conditions are treated separately for the new and existing states. To enable participating&#13;
states and the TSG to gain understanding of the financial implications of the project, finance&#13;
studies carried out under terms of reference agreed with IDA are required of each&#13;
participating state.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
3.10         Investment Capacity. All three new DPEP states should have little difficulty&#13;
funding 15 percent of project cost. As a share of total 1994/95 expenditures on elementary&#13;
education, the average annual contribution will be under 0.3 percent in Gujarat, 0.7 percent in&#13;
Orissa and 2.3 percent in Himachal Pradesh. As a share of plan expenditures on elementary&#13;
education the contributions would be 18.2, 4.2 and 12.1 percent, respectively. Each state&#13;
should be able to continue the implementation of additional programs outside of the DPEP.&#13;
3.11         For the six states participating in DPEP I financed by the IDA credit, the&#13;
required annual contribution was calculated to be equal to between 2 and 17 percent of their&#13;
1993/94 plan expenditures on elementary education, except in Kerala where the absolute level&#13;
of resources involved was the lowest and equal to just 0.6 percent of non-plan expenditure on&#13;
elementary education. The first year experience of these states contributing their required&#13;
share is encouraging. Although the number of DPEP districts in each of these states is likely to&#13;
double under DPEP II, it is not likely that the requirement to contribute 15 percent of the total&#13;
project cost will be difficult to meet for any of them. The two other states to be included in&#13;
DPEP II are Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. In the former, primary education is&#13;
currently supported in 10 districts under a separate IDA credit. In the latter, 19 districts are&#13;
being supported within DPEP through an EC grant. The number of additional districts to be&#13;
proposed in each state is not yet known, but it is likely to be between 10 and 15. In recent&#13;
years in both states, education expenditures have increased rapidly. In Madhya Pradesh, real&#13;
total expenditure on elementary education in 1994/95 was 43 percent above the 1991/92 level.&#13;
In general, if DPEP districts in Madhya Pradesh increase from 19 to 30, the annual state&#13;
contribution would be around Rs. 30 crores. In 1994/95 plan expenditures on elementary&#13;
education were Rs. 85 crores and total expenditures Rs. 940 crores. In Uttar Pradesh, state&#13;
plan expenditures on elementary education over the past four years have been Rs. 53, Rs. 70,&#13;
Rs. 205 and Rs. 219 crores, respectively. Non plan expenditures increased from Rs. 980 to&#13;
Rs. 1,468 crores. The additional state requirement if an extra ten districts are added would be&#13;
Rs. 10 crores. While the required contributions should be feasible, the DPEP Bureau will need&#13;
to monitor carefully the timeliness of the payment of the state share in the anticipated project&#13;
cost.&#13;
3.12         Resource Additionality.  The requirement that the state's contribution to&#13;
DPEP is a net addition to expenditures on elementary education is central to GOI's intention&#13;
that the program leads to overall increases in resources for primary education. The concept of&#13;
additionality adopted for DPEP I reflected the agreement between IDA and GOI for the&#13;
Social Safety Net arrangement. States' contributions to DPEP were to be in addition to at&#13;
least a maintenance of real resources for elementary education at their 1991/92 levels. For&#13;
DPEP II, the GOI has altered the base year to 1995/96. Recent evidence suggests that this&#13;
condition should not be difficult to achieve for most states. The condition will be most&#13;
difficult to meet for those states where either planned levels of expansion are significant or&#13;
where past enrollment and expenditure growth has been highest.&#13;
3.13         The real annual rate of growth of expenditures on elementary education in the&#13;
three new DPEP states (Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa) between 1991/92 and 1994/95&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
was over nine percent in each state. Plan expenditures increased at even higher rates in Orissa&#13;
and Himachal Pradesh. In Gujarat, real plan expenditures fell. The requirement to at least&#13;
maintain the real value of total elementary education expenditures, in addition to the DPEP&#13;
contributions, should pose no problems providing past rates of growth in education&#13;
expenditures and if overall growth of government revenues are maintained and the overall&#13;
growth of govemment revenues is buoyant. However, the large budget deficits and debt&#13;
stocks in Orissa and Himachal Pradesh indicate the need for fiscal adjustment if expenditures&#13;
on the social sectors are to be supported at previous levels.&#13;
3.14         In five of the six DPEP I states financed by IDA, real resources for elementary&#13;
education increased in 1994/95 over the 1991/92 levels, and the 1995/96 budgets maintain this&#13;
situation. In Tamil Nadu, real resources in 1994/95 were just maintained at the 1991/92 levels&#13;
but the 1995/96 budget indicates a reduction. Real plan expenditures in both years are below&#13;
the 1991/92 level. Existing analysis and recent experiences suggest that the expansion of&#13;
DPEP to a small number of additional districts in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Haryana would&#13;
be achievable relatively easily within the additionality requirement. There are severe&#13;
constraints on plan financing in general in Kerala but the low plan base for elementary&#13;
education and the strong growth of non-plan expenditures suggest the additionality condition&#13;
would be met. There will need to be careful monitoring in Assam where plan expenditures&#13;
have tended to be used to finance recurrent obligations. Any proposed further expansion of&#13;
districts in Tamil Nadu will require an assessment of actual expenditures in 1995/96 and an&#13;
acceptable explanation if the real level were to fall below that in 1991/92. 12 In Uttar Pradesh&#13;
and Madhya Pradesh, the pressures will be greatest. The high priority given to primary&#13;
education demonstrated in policy statements and resource allocation decisions, including&#13;
funding support for the implementation of UPBEP and DPEP I, suggests that the real&#13;
resources for elementary education are likely to be more than maintained, although a higher&#13;
share of these resources will be needed to fund the 15 percent requirement than in other states&#13;
because of the large number of districts to be included in DPEP II.&#13;
3.15         Sustainability of Recurrent Costs. The third DPEP financial requirement&#13;
relates to sustainability. The ability of states to sustain the incremental recurrent costs at the&#13;
end of the project on non-plan budgets will essentially depend on the future strength of the&#13;
economy and the methods used to adjust to underlying unsustainable trends in revenue growth&#13;
and expenditures evident in several Project states.&#13;
3.16         For the new DPEP states the annual recurring costs in the year following the&#13;
end of the project are estimated provisionally to be Rs. 8.5 crores for Gujarat and Rs. 12&#13;
crores for Himachal Pradesh and Orissa. Assuming a continuation of past real rates of growth&#13;
in non-plan expenditures to the end of the project, these costs would be equal to less than 12&#13;
percent of the normal increase in expenditures for that year in Gujarat and Orissa, and to just&#13;
over 40 percent in Himachal Pradesh. On this assumption, the additional costs would be&#13;
comfortably covered in each state. Current levels of budget deficit and interest payments in&#13;
12 Tamil Nadu has experienced a rapid growth in primary enrollments, resulting in a 140% GER.&#13;
Furthermore, the size of the school age population cohort is declining rapidly. This suggests that further&#13;
increases in investment expenditures on primary education may not be justified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Orissa and Himachal Pradesh, however, suggest that adjustment will be required in the states'&#13;
public finances if past rates of growth are to be maintained and if programs to further expand&#13;
and improve primary schooling are to be introduced more widely across the states.&#13;
3.17         Previous analysis suggests that in each state, apart from Haryana and Assam,&#13;
the incremental costs generated by the expansion of the coverage in IDA supported DPEP I&#13;
states might just be covered by the normal departmental increment (though leaving few&#13;
additional resources for non-Project districts). In both Assam and Haryana, expansion would&#13;
necessitate intensified efforts to increase revenues and alter patterns of expenditure. Assam&#13;
will be aided by being treated as a Special Category state for which the terms of central&#13;
transfers are much more favorable. Haryana has the third highest per capita income across the&#13;
major states. The required increases in the non-plan budget would be within the government's&#13;
means if the political will exists. Again, the lack of increase in real levels of expenditure in&#13;
Tamil Nadu will require an acceptable explanation when that state applies for additional&#13;
funding (see footnote 8) The most serious problems are likely to arise for Uttar Pradesh and&#13;
Madhya Pradesh. The number of districts being supported, and the required additional levels&#13;
of non-plan expenditure, will be significantly greater than in other states. Both are among the&#13;
group of poorest states and are giving a high policy priority to the development of basic&#13;
education as the foundation of social and economic growth. Uttar Pradesh has the fourth&#13;
highest fiscal deficit and debt stock as shares of state domestic product across major states&#13;
and the highest level of interest payments as a share of revenues. The need to improve the&#13;
public finances of these states will be intensified by this project.&#13;
3.18         In addition to a continuous monitoring of the financi;  guidelines by the DPEP&#13;
bureau, there will be a need in the project for a detailed assessment of the recurrent cost&#13;
liabilities being developed and the actions required to sustain them. During negotiations, GOI&#13;
agreed that: (i) it will carry out a study, with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA containing&#13;
a description and assessment of the trends of expenditures incurred by Project states on&#13;
elementary and other levels of education; (ii) this study shall be carried out twice, once before&#13;
the first in-depth review (by December 31, 1997), and once before the third in-depth review&#13;
(by December 31, 2001); and (iii) the study shall be submitted to IDA at least 30 days prior to&#13;
the date of each such review (para 5.1 (i) and Annex 16).&#13;
3.19         Over the past two years, the Government of India has repeated its intention to&#13;
ensure that the level of public expenditure for education will increase to a level equivalent to&#13;
six percent of GDP by the end of the Ninth Plan. The current share is under four percent.&#13;
Depending on how this is to be achieved, the problems of sustaining major programs to&#13;
achieve universal schooling in the educationally backward states may be partially mitigated.&#13;
D. Project Implementation&#13;
3.20         The size, complexity and degree of innovation involved in the start-up phases&#13;
of DPEP II are recognized by the GOI and states. Implementation would be through&#13;
incremental expansion of national, state and district components and the release of funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
reflecting performance and the rate of utilization of previously released funds. The first year&#13;
of DPEP II implementation would be primarily focused on developmental activities, including:&#13;
(a) capacity building in the new states and districts; (b) preparation and planning for new&#13;
districts in existing DPEP I states and Uttar Pradesh; and (c) establishment of the basic&#13;
professional and physical infrastructure for improved learning in participating districts (Annex&#13;
4).&#13;
3.21         In addition to the 15 districts (maximum), an additional 50 to 60 districts in the&#13;
seven DPEP I states and Uttar Pradesh will be appraised by the DPEP Bureau during the first&#13;
18 months of project implementation. In accordance with the DPEP Guidelines, states&#13;
seeking funding for the expansion of DPEP II into districts from the eligible pool described in&#13;
Annex 9 must satisfy the following requirements: (i) good project implementation;&#13;
(ii) compliance of the new district plans with the DPEP guidelines (Annex 8);&#13;
(iii) implementation of the baseline survey of student achievement, social assessment study and&#13;
participation report; (iv) evidence of payment of the 15 percent state contribution to the&#13;
ongoing DPEP program; (v) completion of an education finance study with standard terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to IDA; and (vi) demonstrated additionality of DPEP investments&#13;
compared to 1995/96 elementary education expenditure levels. During negotiations, Project&#13;
states agreed that each Project state shall: (i) carry out, and cause its SIS to carry out, the&#13;
Project, as applicable to such state, in accordance with the DPEP Guidelines; and (ii) carry out&#13;
the Project in accordance with an implementation plan satisfactory to IDA (para 5.2(j) and&#13;
Annex 4).&#13;
3.22         At negotiations, GOI agreed that: (i) all investment proposals and work plans&#13;
for Project districts will be approved by the Project state and the DPEP Bureau in accordance&#13;
with criteria satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.1(1)), (ii) the first two appraisals of Project district&#13;
investment proposals will be submitted to IDA for review prior to the financing and&#13;
investment proposals in a Project state under the credit; and (iii) the Borrower shall provide&#13;
IDA a sample of 20 percent of appraisals approved by the Borrower and the Project states for&#13;
Project districts, for review by IDA on an ex-post basis (para. 5. 1 (e)).&#13;
3.23         The initial year of project implementation would be based on work plans and&#13;
budgets approved by the DPEP Bureau on the basis of state appraisal reports prepared by the&#13;
TSG. These reports have been reviewed by IDA for 12 of the 15 districts (maximum) in the&#13;
three new DPEP states and will be revised taking into account comments of the IDA appraisal&#13;
mission.  A revised version of the national appraisal reports and preliminary first year&#13;
(FY96/97) state and district AWPBs for the 12 appraised Project districts in the three new&#13;
states have been prepared and reviewed. The first year AWPBs would emphasize project&#13;
launch and start-up activities. Project launch workshops would be carried out in each state&#13;
and district. Program management training would be provided for national, state and district&#13;
management teams (Annex 6). Other elements included in most first year AWPBs would be&#13;
the provision of technical assistance programs to state and district institutions participating in&#13;
DPEP, school statistics EMIS, strengthening instructional materials agencies, the design and&#13;
development of first phase in-service training systems, and limited civil works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
E. Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.24         The central program management monitoring tool would be the annual review&#13;
by the DPEP Bureau of AWPBs prepared by each participating state including: (i) the action&#13;
plans, investment proposals and financing requirements for the next fiscal year; and (ii) reports&#13;
on the progress of implementation covering physical targets for civil works, procurement,&#13;
training; software and system development, and expenditures. The review would be conducted&#13;
by the DPEP Bureau and Project Board in January of each year. Progress reports and work&#13;
plans would follow a common framework.&#13;
3.25         Progress towards the achievement of development objectives would be&#13;
measured in four ways. First, baseline surveys and follow-up assessments conducted in the&#13;
third and sixth year of the project would monitor progress on key education indicators, most&#13;
importantly, student learning achievement. The results of these studies would be discussed at&#13;
one of the annual implementation review workshops (most probably in June 1999) and at&#13;
project completion (by December 2002). GOI provided preliminary reports on baseline&#13;
achievement studies to IDA prior to negotiations. At negotiations, GOI and the Project states&#13;
agreed that assessments studies would be carried out in all Project districts, with scope and&#13;
content acceptable to IDA, in the third and sixth calendar years following the calendar year in&#13;
which the credit becomes effective (para 5.3 (a)). Project performance indicators developed&#13;
by DOE/GOI have also been agreed with IDA (Annex 5).&#13;
3.26         Program evaluation and research studies would provide a second source of&#13;
monitoring information. They would monitor the establishment of more effective teaching and&#13;
learning processes at the school level. A third source would be a computerized project&#13;
management information system (PMIS), currently being developed under DPEP I,&#13;
augmented by the annual review exercise. The first module of the PMIS, which tracks state&#13;
and district activity plans and budgets, was developed during project preparation of DPEP I&#13;
and has been used since its inception. Progress reporting formats are included in the program&#13;
implementation manual and refer to project components, budgets, physical progress&#13;
monitoring, technical assistance and training, procurement monitoring, expenditure and&#13;
disbursement, claim progress monitoring, and financial management.&#13;
3.27         A fourth source of information would be the supervision reports of the DPEP&#13;
Bureau and the joint supervision missions. The current supervision strategy of the DPEP&#13;
Bureau needs to be adjusted to take into account the increased scope and complexity of the&#13;
program as it expands to increase the coverage to about 125 to 135 districts and 13 states&#13;
including Uttar Pradesh"3. To ensure effective supervision in a program of this magnitude the&#13;
13Forty two districts under DPEP I financing (23 districts covered by the IDA credit in Assam, Haryana,&#13;
Karnataka, Kerala. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu; 19 districts under the ODA grant in Madhya Pradesh); 50&#13;
to 60 new districts in the above-mentioned DPEP I states and Uttar Pradesh, plus up to 15 in the three new&#13;
states (Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa) to be financed by a proposed new IDA credit and a grant from&#13;
the GON; ten more districts to be financed by a new ODA grant (5 in Andhra Pradesh and 5 in West Bengal);&#13;
and ten districts in Uttar Pradesh under the UPBEP IDA credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
following steps will be implemented: (a) explicit delegation of supervision responsibility to&#13;
the state offices in all DPEP I states and UP starting with the FY1997/98; (b) a gradual&#13;
decentralization of supervision responsibility in the second generation DPEP states to the&#13;
SPOs; (c) fiill operationalization of the PMIS in the first generation states by July 1996 and in&#13;
the second generation states by January 1997; (d) implementation of the school statistics&#13;
EMIS in all states starting September 1996; and (e) full operationalization of the research,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation program, including the monitoring in sample districts, focusing&#13;
especially on qualitative and process indicators by September 1996 in already participating&#13;
states and gradual expansion into the second generation states.&#13;
3.28         IDA supervision of DPEP II will be integrated into the supervision of DPEP I&#13;
and UPBEP during the lives of these two projects, which currently are being fully managed&#13;
from an expanded staff in the New Delhi resident mission. The new supervision scheme,&#13;
explained in Annex 16, will focus on developing the supervision capacity of national and state&#13;
staff in addition to closely monitoring implementation and disbursements.  The main&#13;
characteristics of the proposed integrated supervision scheme are: (a) joint supervision&#13;
missions would be carried out twice a year by specialist staff appointed by GOI and program&#13;
donors; (b) the DPEP Bureau would carry out its own supervision missions to participating&#13;
states and districts once a year; (c) states would carry out supervision of districts twice a&#13;
year; (d) standardized summary supervision reports of the states and the DPEP Bureau would&#13;
be made available to program donors twice a year as part of the progress reporting system;&#13;
and (d) an annual implementation review workshop would be held where states would report&#13;
on their project implementation progress and share experiences in the implementation of one&#13;
program element selected in consultation with the program donors.&#13;
3.29         Essential to the success of the supervision work will be: (i) the quality of the&#13;
national and state supervision; and (ii) the effectiveness of the PMIS, EMIS and the National&#13;
Research Monitoring and Evaluation reporting systems (Annex 5), as well as other reports&#13;
covering physical targets for civil works, procurement, and training, software and system&#13;
development, and expenditures extracted from the PMIS prepared for the joint supervision&#13;
missions. The joint DPEP I supervision mission of DPEP I scheduled for June 1996 will pay&#13;
special attention to the progress in establishing these different reporting systems.&#13;
3.30         In the first two years a special supervision effort would be required to:&#13;
(i) monitor the start-up of the DPEP program in the new states (Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh&#13;
and Orissa); and (ii) review the effectiveness of the national appraisal process for the&#13;
expansion districts in already participating states where IDA will review a sample of expansion&#13;
districts. These appraisal review missions would include a review of implementation progress&#13;
in each of the participating states. Starting the third year, two joint supervision missions&#13;
would be organized, each covering six DPEP states.&#13;
3.31         In addition, IDA will provide continuous implementation support, especially&#13;
through participation of resident education staff in the many thematic workshops organized by&#13;
the DPEP Bureau and designed to exchange implementation experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
3.32         DPEP Guidelines and procedures would be reviewed periodically. Changes in&#13;
guidelines would require concurrence of the DPEP Project Board and would be reviewed by&#13;
IDA (para. 2.1).&#13;
3.33         During negotiations, GOI and Project states agreed that each Project state&#13;
shall: (i) review annually with IDA, progress in project implementation and credit&#13;
disbursements over the preceding 12 months; (ii) discuss with IDA by March 31 of each year,&#13;
annual work plans and budgets for the next 12 months; (iii) carry out along with IDA and&#13;
other external financiers of the DPEP, a joint review of the project on three occasions: first,&#13;
by December 31, 1997, second, by December 31, 1999, and third, by December 31, 2001; and&#13;
(iv) duly take into account comments offered by IDA during such joint review in the course of&#13;
further implementation of the project (para. 5.3(b) and Annex 16).&#13;
F. Status of Preparation&#13;
3.34         In preparing the project, the GOI has sought to develop a strong sense of&#13;
ownership by fully involving national technical experts and by initiating preparation with 12&#13;
district proposals in the three new states, developed by district officials, with support from&#13;
state and national planning teams.  State proposals in these three states were prepared&#13;
concurrently. The preparation of the Distance Education Component of the proposed project&#13;
was completed by appraisal. A parallel program of project preparation studies have been&#13;
implemented under DPEP I financing by scholars at NCERT and NIEPA in cooperation with&#13;
state agencies, with technical and financial support from UNICEF and IDA. The process has&#13;
been marked by extensive interaction between the GOI and states and districts, including&#13;
training in educational planning for district and state teams at NIEPA.&#13;
3.35         DPEP II has been designed to provide program support to DPEP with the&#13;
DPEP Bureau acting as the national management authority which appraises state and district&#13;
investment plans and reviews and approves annual work programs and budgets (AWPBs).&#13;
IDA has reviewed the appraisal of 12 district and 3 state investment proposals in the three&#13;
new states by the DPEP Bureau and will continue to monitor the national capacity in this&#13;
regard (para 3.22). Plans for expansion districts are expected to be appraised within the next&#13;
18 months by the DPEP Bureau.&#13;
3.36         The capacity of the DPEP Bureau through its TSG to manage the preparation,&#13;
appraisal and implementation of state and district programs is central to the effective&#13;
implementation of DPEP II. The program will expand within two years to cover between 125&#13;
to 135 districts in 13 states14 (of which 12 are major states) from the current 42 districts in 7&#13;
states under DPEP I and 10 districts in UPBEP (para. 3.27). This makes it imperative to&#13;
strengthen the appraisal capacity of the national structure (DPEP Bureau and its TSG) and to&#13;
implement a decentralization strategy to ensure that the participating states take an increased&#13;
14 In addition to the 11 states comprised in DPEP II financed by IDA with co-financing of the GON, DPEP&#13;
will further expand into 5 districts of Andhra Pradesh and 5 in West Bengal under a grant from the ODA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
responsibility in the provision of technical support to the districts, review district AWPBs, and&#13;
supervise implementation at the district level (paras 2.48 to 2.50).&#13;
3.37         The TSG has made valuable contributions to the implementation of DPEP I&#13;
and in the appraisal process of the 12 DPEP II districts in the three new states.  The&#13;
corresponding appraisal reports were reviewed by IDA following discussion with the state and&#13;
district planning teams. The reports showed continued progress in the quality of the district&#13;
and state plans and in the effectiveness of the appraisal work done by the DPEP Bureau/TSG.&#13;
This justifies the basic project strategy of delegation of the responsibility for the appraisal of&#13;
district plans for expansion districts to the DPEP Bureau and a gradual shift from ex-ante to&#13;
ex-post IDA review.&#13;
3.38         A strategy with the following key elements would be implemented to further&#13;
develop the national appraisal capacity: (a) preparation of revised appraisal reports in a&#13;
standard format for each of the three new DPEP states incorporating the observations of the&#13;
IDA appraisal mission and the agreements reached between the appraisal mission and DOE,&#13;
and discussion of the revisions with the states, (b) strengthening the staffing of the national&#13;
appraisal missions to include at least one: (i) education specialist; (ii) civil works specialist;&#13;
and (iii) education planner/economist; (c) extending the duration of the appraisal mission to at&#13;
least one full week (probably two weeks in states with more than three districts) to allow time&#13;
for a visit to one or more sample district(s) and detailed review discussions with the state and&#13;
district planning teams; (d) preparation of a plan for the appraisal of the first batch of&#13;
expansion districts for discussion with IDA at least two weeks before the first national&#13;
appraisal mission; and (e) IDA discussions with the DPEP Bureau and the national appraisal&#13;
teams of the effectiveness of the national state appraisa!1 process following IDA review of the&#13;
NSARs and related field visits.&#13;
3.39         DPEP II is benefiting from the: (i) baseline and social assessment studies&#13;
(Annex 15) carried out in the 12 participating districts of the three new states using terms of&#13;
reference and methodologies established and discussed with IDA under DPEP I; and&#13;
(ii) management structures (program structures and procedures and management capacity)&#13;
and methodology to develop detailed AWPBs for the first year of activities at the national,&#13;
state and district sub-project to be appraised by the DPEP Bureau through its TSG, also&#13;
developed under DPEP I financing.&#13;
3.40         The preliminary results of the baseline assessment studies fully confirm the&#13;
DPEP focus on improving learning achievement through increasirf. non-salary inputs. They&#13;
also demonstrate the central importance of improving instruction in language and mathematics&#13;
in the early primary grades.  Preliminary results of the teacher study also reinforce the&#13;
importance of a substantial effort for in-service training.  These results provide the&#13;
justification for national and state technical assistance programs and for clear focus on key&#13;
activities in district programs. The textbook study underlies the state-specific quality and&#13;
efficiency programs that would be supported by DPEP. AWPBs for technical assistance&#13;
programs for school statistics EMIS system development, primary teacher in-service training&#13;
and program evaluation research and studies have been prepared and appraised.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
3.41         Popular participation is a cornerstone of DPEP. During project preparation in&#13;
the three new states, documented participatory meetings involving women, SC and ST&#13;
parents, teachers, NGOs and local officials were held at district, block and community levels&#13;
for consultations on problems facing primary education and on likely solutions (Annex 15).&#13;
The reports of these meetings are available in project files. Focus group discussions have&#13;
been completed as part of the gender and tribal studies. At negotiations, Project states agreed&#13;
that each Project state shall: (i) implement the project in accordance with strategies acceptable&#13;
to IDA for improving primary education of female students; (ii) implement the project in any&#13;
tribal area (as designated by such state in accordance with applicable laws), in accordance&#13;
with procedures and delivery strategies satisfactory to IDA; and (iii) ensure that all&#13;
investments in Project districts which are classified by the Borrower as tribal districts, or&#13;
which include blocks classified by the Borrower as tribal blocks, are appraised and&#13;
implemented in accordance with a plan, satisfactory to IDA, for the delivery of project&#13;
benefits to tribal people (paras. 2.27 and 5.2(e)). Approved action plans will be tested&#13;
through state pilot projects, which would be subjected to continued refinement of intervention&#13;
strategies. Strengthened community/school organizations in all states and districts would&#13;
provide a mechanism for continuing beneficiary participation in program implementation.&#13;
3.42         Civil work plans for first year activities have been laid out by the three new&#13;
states and are largely confined to the repair of existing schools, expansion of existing schools&#13;
and construction of classrooms at new school sites where site acquisition is not an issue&#13;
(Annex 13).   GOI will: (i) develop school construction designs that reflect education&#13;
environments consistent with the DPEP pedagogical vision developed at each participating&#13;
state; (ii) ensure that all states experiment with new cost-effective designs and quality&#13;
construction processes through adequate supervision and with the support of the School&#13;
Construction Innovation Fund (para. 2.39); and (iii) develop the capacity of the SPOs and the&#13;
TSG to review designs and manage construction supervision. At negotiations, Project states&#13;
agreed that Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa shall submit standard designs for&#13;
classrooms and BRCs for review and approval by IDA prior to the start of any construction of&#13;
classrooms and BRCs under the project, and in any event no later than June 30, 1997 (para.&#13;
5.2(h)).&#13;
3.43         Design work for common construction elements, such as classroom buildings&#13;
and block resource centers, has been compiled into Project Construction Manuals, which&#13;
incorporate related technical specifications, structural detailing, survey requirements and&#13;
similar material. These manuals (which have already been completed for each DPEP I state&#13;
and Uttar Pradesh, and are being developed for each of the three new DPEP II states) provide&#13;
guidance for the selection and use of construction materials and for the methods of&#13;
construction for the majority of the facilities being built under DPEP I.&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
3.44         The procurement plan reflects the widespread and decentralized nature of the&#13;
activities that will be conducted by the eleven project states in some 50 to 60 districts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
throughout the six year life of the project.  Many of the procurement actions in support of&#13;
project work do not lend themselves well to aggregation for bidding as large single contracts.&#13;
Civil works, for example, is dominated by the small-scale construction of single and double&#13;
classrooms totaling over 40,000 classrooms in all at nearly 20,000 separate sites over the first&#13;
five years of the project. Likewise, the purchases of consumables and teaching materials&#13;
amount to over US$57.5 million in aggregate, but over 80 percent of it is comprised of small&#13;
scale purchases of easily acquired local materials for both new and existing schools in the&#13;
Project districts, estimated to cost less than US$40 per classroom each year.&#13;
3.45          Tables 3.3 and 3.4 summarize the project items, their related cost estimates and&#13;
proposed  methods  of procurement.   Project-related procure ,t ent of goods and works&#13;
would follow procedures acceptable to IDA using National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
documents and National Shopping Procedures acceptable to the Association. Project-financed&#13;
consultants would be recruited according to Guidelines on the Use of Consuiltants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers. Procurement of equipment, vehicles, furniture, books and educational&#13;
materials would be bulked to the extent possible and would generally be procured as follows:&#13;
(a)    individual contracts estimated to exceed US$300,000 would be procured using&#13;
ICB (although there are no plans at present for individual purchases greater than&#13;
US$300,000);&#13;
(b)   individual contracts with  an  estimated  value between  US$50,000  and&#13;
US$300,000 would be procured using NCB; and&#13;
(c)    individual purchases of off-the-shelf items through rate contracts or prudent&#13;
shopping procedures would be acceptable in packages of lss than US$50,000 up to&#13;
the aggregate limits as outlined in Table 3.3 and 3.4.&#13;

3.46         Civil Works (US$127.9 million) and Civil Works Maintenance (US$3.2&#13;
million). Over eighty-five percent of civil works would be for small, scattered construction of&#13;
school classrooms, and for school rehabilitation and repair, with an average estimated base&#13;
cost per primary  school site of US$8,000.   All such  school construction  and&#13;
rehabilitation/repair estimated to cost less than US$20,000 would be carried out using one of&#13;
following four methods: (1) NCB procedures acceptable to IDA; (2) community school&#13;
construction programs, (3) prudent shopping with solicitation of price quotations from at least&#13;
three bidders; or (4) Force Account (Force Account method will be limited to an aggregate&#13;
ceiling of not more than US$13.1 million which is roughly 10 percent of all civil works costs).&#13;
Generally, the day-to-day management and supervision of the construction would be done by&#13;
the State Public Works Departments or similar organizations. Civil works at DIETs, SIEMTs&#13;
and Block Resource Center buildings or other facilities estimated at more than US$20,000 per&#13;
site would be carried out through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA under the management&#13;
of the State PWD or equivalent. Generally, the day-to-day management and supervision of the&#13;
construction would be done by the State Public Works Departments or similar organizations.&#13;
Civil works at DIETs, SIEMTs and Block Resource Center buildings or other facilities&#13;
estimated at more than US$20,000 per site would be carried out through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA under the management of the State PWD or equivalent organization. A&#13;
summary of the categories of civil works to be constructed under the project is shown in the&#13;
table above.&#13;
3.47         Furniture (US$16.0 million) and Equipment (US$16.2 million). Furniture&#13;
and equipment would be purchased on an annual basis in accordance with the phasing of&#13;
project activities. Equipment consists of office and audio visual equipment (computers, TVs,&#13;
VCRs, typewriters) with unit costs less than US$10,000, and small items (science laboratory&#13;
equipment, science kits) with unit costs of less than US$500. Because of the phasing of the&#13;
project and the diversity of items to be procured, ICB procedures would generally not be&#13;
practicable. Contracts for equipment valued at US$300,000 or less would be made through&#13;
NCB procedures acceptable to IDA.  Purchases of furniture and equipment totaling&#13;
US$50,000 or less, and not exceeding in aggregate US$11.2 million for furniture and&#13;
US$11.4 for equipment or equivalent or about 70 percent of total furniture and equipment&#13;
costs, may be awarded on the basis of rate contract or prudent shopping with solicitation of&#13;
price quotations from at least three vendors.&#13;
3.48        Vehicles (US$2.7 million). Pi rcurement of vehici..s would be phased on an&#13;
annual basis over the first four years of the project in accordance with the requirements of the&#13;
project activities as additional districts are brought into the DPEP Program. The majority of&#13;
costs are for jeeps to be used at the state and district headquarters. Because the project&#13;
involves 11 states and 55 or more districts, no contract is expected to contain more than 10&#13;
vehicles, and the program does not lend itself to ICB. (Experience in DPEP I has shown that&#13;
competitive bidding of small lots as either ICB or NCB has not yielded adequate vendor&#13;
interest). However, purchases of vehicles would be bulked whenever possible and procured at&#13;
the state level in contracts valued at more than US$100,000 through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA. For purchases not exceeding US$100,000, procurement will be through&#13;
national rate contracts entered into by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(DGS&amp;D) or local shopping procedures, comparing price quotations from at least three&#13;
suppliers to ensure competitive prices up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$2.7&#13;
million.&#13;
3.49        Books (US$25.9 million) and Teaching Materials (US$88.1 million).&#13;
Educational materials and books would be purchased throughout the life of the project in&#13;
accordance with the phasing and entry of new districts into the DPEP Program. Books and&#13;
educational materials would be in the local language, and are available from local&#13;
manufacturers. Efficient purchasing, storage and distribution of this type of material to over&#13;
40,000 school sites in the 11 Project states does not lend itself to b_lking of requirements for&#13;
ICB. With some exception for common reference books or teaching materials, bulking&#13;
requirements for purchase through NCB is also not a practical solution. Nevertheless,&#13;
purchases would be bulked whenever possible and procured at the state level in contracts&#13;
valued at US$50,000 or more through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA for an aggregate&#13;
amount not exceeding US$7.3 million for books and US$19.2 for teaching materials. For&#13;
small purchases not exceeding US$50,000, procurement will be through national rate&#13;
contracts entered into by the DGS&amp;D or local shopping procedures, comparing price&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers to ensure competitive prices up to an aggregate&#13;
amount not exceeding US$15.5 million for books and US$68.9 for teaching materials. (This&#13;
amounts to local shopping procedures totaling approximately $250,000 per district per year ).&#13;
For purchases of book materials that are only available from a single source of supply,&#13;
provision is made for direct purchasing without competition in accordance with IDA&#13;
provisions for an aggregate amount not exceedLng US$3.0 million&#13;
3.50        Training and Workshops (US$57.8 million).  This category includes&#13;
expenses related to training of teachers and other project staff over the life of the project in&#13;
respect of seminars, workshops, fellowships, travel and subsistence allowances.&#13;
3.51        Consultants and Studies (US$17.7 million). Consultants required under the&#13;
project will be hired following procedures prescribed in the Guidelines on the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers.  Documents used for inviting proposals, terms of&#13;
reference for all consultancies and single source contracts will be subject to prior review for&#13;
all contracts valued at US$100,000 or more awarded to firms and US$50,000 or more to be&#13;
awarded to individuals.&#13;
3.52        Vehicle and Equipment Maintenance (US$1.1 mi!'ion). Maintenance costs&#13;
for vehicles and equipment items estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1.1 million would be procured from local commercial suppliers of&#13;
such services in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.53         IDA Review. All procurement for goods and works under contracts valued at&#13;
US$300,000 or more would be subject to IDA's prior review; in addition, the first five NCB&#13;
contracts for goods in each new DPEP state, regardless of size, will be subject to prior&#13;
review.  All other contracts for civil works or goods would be subject to random post&#13;

US$50,000 equivalent or more would be subject to prior review and approval by IDA.&#13;
Approximately 35 percent of the value of contracts covered by the IDA credit would require&#13;
prior review.  This relatively low percentage is considered satisfactory since the state&#13;
governments have gained experience in procurement in DPEP I and other previous Bank&#13;
projects.&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
3.54         Disbursement Profile. The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed over six&#13;
and one half years, generally consistent with the standard profile for PHR projects in India.&#13;
The project is expected to be completed on December 31, 2002, and closed on June 30, 2003.&#13;
Annex 3 shows the forecast of expenditures and disbursements.&#13;
3.55        Disbursement Percentages.   The IDA  credit would be disbursed in&#13;
accordance with Table 3.5 below.&#13;
3.56        Required Documentation. Disbursements for all civil works and goods over&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent per contract, consulting firm contracts over US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
and individual consultants over US$50,000 would be fully documented and all other&#13;
expenditures would be disbursed on the basis of statement of expenditure, with supporting&#13;
documentation retained by each state government for review by IDA during supervision&#13;
mission. No withdrawals of the proceeds of the credit shall be made for payments related to&#13;
any Project state until the State Implementation Society of that state has entered into a&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding with GOI (para 5.5).&#13;
3.57         Special Account. In order to accelerate disbursement in respect of IDA's&#13;
share of expenditures pre-financed by GOI and the state governments, and to allow for direct&#13;
payment of other local and foreign expenditures, GOI agreed during negotiations to maintain&#13;
a Special Account in the Reserve Bank of India in the amount of US$17.0 million, equivalent&#13;
to cover four months of estimated disbursements through the Special Account (para 5.1 (k)).&#13;
The GOI would release an advance of an estimated six months of expected project&#13;
requirements for IDA financed items as grants to the SISs in each of the Project states (para&#13;
2.51 and 5.1 (f)). The state Governments would also place their own contribution in the&#13;
accounts of the SISs. These provisions are identical to those employed in the DPEP I project.&#13;
3.58        Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in the amount of SDR 2.8&#13;
million is recommended to cover eligible expenditures incurred in implementing appraised&#13;
project activities after March 1, 1996. Retroactive financing would support such items as&#13;
initial staff appointments, conducting of pedagogical visioning workshops in participating&#13;
states, developing a project monitoring system, and piloting construction of community&#13;
schools to test designs and cost parameters. All procurement would be made against eligible&#13;
categories of expenditures in the project and would follow IDA procurement guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.59          DPEP I1 implementation is conditioned on the capacity of the DPEP Bureau&#13;
and participating state governments to sustain the implementation and disbursement processes&#13;
of DPEP I. DPEP has seen a rapid increase in implementation and disbursement in the last six&#13;
months.&#13;

K Audits And Accounting&#13;
3.62         The project expenditures incurred by Project states and SISs would be subject&#13;
to the normal GOI and state accounting and auditing procedures, with the added requirement&#13;
that the SISs would establish and maintain separate accounts and an accounting system to&#13;
record all project transactions and appropriate support documentation for the transactions. At&#13;
negotiations, GOI agreed that Project accounts shall be audited annually, in accordance with&#13;
appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to IDA&#13;
(para 5.1 (j). The Project states agreed at negotiations that each SIS shall be audited annually,&#13;
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA (para 5.2 (k)). The SISs would make appropriate arrangements&#13;
satisfactory to IDA for auditing the utilization of funds provided by the Societies to other&#13;
institutions, including the SOEs of those other institutions. Documentation supporting SOEs&#13;
would be maintained at least one year after the completion of the audit for the fiscal year in&#13;
which the last withdrawal was made.&#13;
3.63         Central accounts and the Special Account would be subject to normal GOI&#13;
accounting and auditing procedures through the Comptroller and Auditor General of India&#13;
which is considered satisfactory to IDA. The Special Account would show all withdrawal&#13;
requests disbursed, amounts advanced and reimbursed by IDA, and balanced at the end of&#13;
each accounting period.  The consolidated audit reports would be submitted to the&#13;
Association not later than nine months after the end of each financial year. Audits will cover&#13;
all project expenditures until such time as the credit has been closed.&#13;

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
4.1          The proposed credit would be the second investment in a longer-term program&#13;
to improve literacy and numeracy skills in India, particularly of the rural poor, and hence&#13;
increase productivity and welfare. The total number of beneficiaries would be more than&#13;
double the number to be reached by DPEP I. The proposed project aims to improve the&#13;
quality of instruction and learning achievement for approximately 10 million children per year.&#13;
It is expected that more than 50 percent of the children benefiting from the project would be&#13;
girls. Another objective of the proposed credit is to raise the proportion of primary school&#13;
completers by improving access to, and reducing dropout from, primary schools. The project&#13;
would provide access to primary education for an estimated one million additional children per&#13;
year and would enable more than 4 million more children per year to complete primary&#13;
education.&#13;
4.2          The economic and social benefits from raising the proportion of primary school&#13;
completers are large. In addition, many of the economic and social benefits have spillover&#13;
effects beyond the child and his/her parents. The economic impact of primary schooling in&#13;
India has been demonstrated in several ways. The most recent rate of return study of primary&#13;
schooling has indicated a return of 13 percent. More recent studies have demonstrated the&#13;
impact of schooling on the utilization of new technology, and its ou.comes, in agriculture. For&#13;
every one rupee increase in profit due to exogenous technical change, those households&#13;
having a member with primary schooling gained an additional 1.38 rupees. In addition,&#13;
farmers with little or no schooling benefited from their more schooled neighbors who were the&#13;
first to adopt the new practices. Bank studies on poverty in Indian states conclude that levels&#13;
of literacy have had long term effects on both consumption levels and poverty reduction. A&#13;
recent study to disaggregate the sources of growth in the Indian economy during the 1970s&#13;
indicated that education in general, and primary education in particular, had a major impact.&#13;
Evidence of the social impact of primary schooling is very strong and has been augmented by&#13;
the recent National Family Health Surveys for each state. The impact of mothers' schooling&#13;
on the total fertility rate, the ideal number of children, infant and child mortality, child&#13;
immunization rates and nutritional status is very strong within each state. Further,&#13;
comparisons across states strongly suggest that the impact has increasing returns once some&#13;
threshold coverage of primary schooling has been attained. Since the districts funded under&#13;
DPEP are by definition poorly developed in terms of educational coverage, the social benefits&#13;
are likely to be high.&#13;
4.3          An additional benefit of the project will be an increase in the internal efficiency&#13;
of the school system. On average, a provision of 8.5 years of schooling is required to produce&#13;
one completer of the five year primary school cycle. DPEP places a major emphasis on&#13;
increasing the quality of education and reducing the drop out rate in primary schools. On the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
assumption that increases in the quality of inputs will reduce repetition and dropout levels by&#13;
half, a total of 6.3 years would be required. This would reduce the costs per graduate by 25&#13;
percent or around Rs. 2,200. Across the 70 Project districts, a total of about 11.8 million&#13;
children are enrolled. These figures imply a 'saving' in the schooling of these children equal&#13;
to US$790 million over approximately six years, which can be utilized both to enroll&#13;
additional children and to increase the inputs per child.&#13;
B. Program Objective Categories&#13;
4.4          Poverty Aspects. The proposed project would contribute to the alleviation of&#13;
poverty by: (a) continuing the process of strengthening the c-p acity of key institutions&#13;
involved in the management and implementation of DPEP started under DPEP I; and (b)&#13;
improving primary education outcomes in about 70 districts in Project states. Beneficiaries of&#13;
the project would overwhelmingly be poor children, especially children with mild to moderate&#13;
disabilities, girls, and SC/ST students for whom specific strategies to reduce dropout, increase&#13;
access and enhance learning achievement are included in the project. Indigenous peoples.&#13;
Several project districts in the new DPEP states have very high concentrations of tribal&#13;
population, with one district in Gujarat being nearly 100 percent tribal. STs would benefit at&#13;
least in proportion to their representation in each project district. The districts would carry out&#13;
their projects in accordance with tribal strategies meeting criteria agreed with IDA, and based&#13;
on social assessment studies. Gender Issues. Female literacy rates in almost all project&#13;
districts (except three in Kerala and three in Tamil Nadu) are below national averages, and all&#13;
district plans would include strategies to imprcve girls' enrollme;it, retention and learning&#13;
achievement.&#13;
C. Risks&#13;
4.5          The ability of states to sustain the incremental recurrent costs at the end of the&#13;
project on non-plan budgets will essentially depend on the future strength of the economy and&#13;
the methods used to adjust to underlying unsustainable trends in revenue growth and&#13;
expenditures evident in several Project states. Assuming a continuation of past real rates of&#13;
growth in non-plan expenditures to the end of the project for the new states, the annual&#13;
recurring costs in the year following the end of the project are estimated to be equal to less&#13;
than 12 percent of the normal increase in expenditures for that year in Gujarat and Orissa, and&#13;
just over 40 percent in Himachal Pradesh. On this assumption, the additional costs would be&#13;
comfortably covered in each state. Previous analysis suggests that ii; each DPEP I state, apart&#13;
from Haryana and Assam, the incremental costs might just be covered by the normal&#13;
departmental increment. The most serious problems are likely to arise for Uttar Pradesh and&#13;
Madhya Pradesh. Both are among the group of poorest states. The need to improve the&#13;
public finances of these states will be intensified by this project. Currently, there is clear&#13;
evidence of an increased commitment to provide the resources for universal primary schooling&#13;
by both central and state governments. Furthermore, the experience of UPBEP and the DPEP&#13;
I are very encouraging in this regard. The National Development Council has made a&#13;
commitment to increase resources for education from the current level of under four percent&#13;
of GDP to six percent by the end of the Ninth Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
4.6          In addition to the project's financial sustainability risk, there are a number of&#13;
project managerial and implementation risks, among which the most important are to ensure that:&#13;
(a) state and district management capacity are in place at the start-up phase of project&#13;
implementation; (b) the DPEP experience gained by the DPEP Bureau and the TSG during DPEP&#13;
I implementation is channeled to the participating DPEP H states; and (c) accountability in&#13;
participating states and districts is based on project monitoring and is performance based. These&#13;
risks are being addressed in the project by: (a) establishing and staffing SISs, SPOs and DPOs&#13;
with key qualified personnel before the appraisal consideration of any district investment&#13;
proposals; (b) ensuring that there will be a transfer of responsibility from the DPEP Bureau to&#13;
the SPOs for project supervision; and (c) making eligibility requirements for all DPEP II&#13;
expansion districts contingent upon good prior project implementation performance under&#13;
DPEP I, or, in the case of Uttar Pradesh, under UPBEP. The project monitoring and&#13;
information system (PMIS) designed and implemented under DPEP I financing, will be used&#13;
to monitor and evaluate this requirement.&#13;
&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
1.          DPEP implementation will be monitored through an integrated system of&#13;
indicators covering UPBEP, DPEP I and DPEP II and state programs funded by other&#13;
donors, most notably the EC (Madhya Pradesh) and ODA (Andhra Pradesh). These&#13;
indicators are designed to provide information on the progress towards the DPEP overall&#13;
objectives, as shown in the table below.&#13;
Table 5.1 DPEP Objectives and Benchmarks&#13;
Objective                            Benchmark&#13;
Equity       reducing differences in enrollment, drop-out and learning gender&#13;
and social achievement among groups to less than 5%&#13;
Efficiency     reducing the overall primary drop-out rate for all students to less&#13;
than 10%&#13;
Achievement    raise average achievement levels in language and mathematics by&#13;
at least 25% over measured baseline levels and ensure 40%&#13;
achievement levels in other competencies&#13;
Access       provide, according to national norms, access for all children to&#13;
primary education classes, or where not possible, to equivalent&#13;
non-formal education&#13;
Capacity      number and percentage of active VECs; number of functional&#13;
building      BRCs; DIETs adequately staffed; SIEMT established, staffed and&#13;
operating; DPEP Resource Group established and operating in&#13;
participating states; PMIS, MIS and Monitoring-Research and&#13;
Evaluation (MRE) program operating.&#13;
2.          The system will report indicators to: (i) track the progress of delivery of&#13;
project inputs; (ii) monitor trends in key education parameters in the project areas; and&#13;
(iii) measure progress towards the program's long term development objectives. The first&#13;
set of indicators are extracted from a purpose designed Project Management Information&#13;
System (PMIS) which reports information on the delivery of key project inputs such as&#13;
civil works, appointment of teachers, training of personnel, completion of studies, release&#13;
of funds, expenditures and disbursement claims submitted. The second set of indicators&#13;
is extracted from a national education management information system (EMIS) which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                           Annex 5&#13;
provides information on the trends on key education indicators in project areas especially&#13;
enrollments, teachers, classrooms broken down as appropriate to show male/female and&#13;
SC/ST disparities. The third set of indicators are extracted from a monitoring, research&#13;
and evaluation system (MRE) that includes survey data on student learning achievement&#13;
and correlates. These data are extracted from surveys which are conducted prior to&#13;
project implementation and repeated every three years. In addition the MRE system&#13;
includes provision to complement these survey data with qualitative and observational&#13;
data and thematic studies.&#13;
3.          PMIS. The PMIS is built from detailed information on the progress of&#13;
project implementation that is inputted at the level where the activities are managed and&#13;
expenditures are incurred. The system is computerized with software custom designed&#13;
for DPEP. Several states have developed modules to satisfy their own specific project&#13;
implementation requirements. The financial modules of the PMIS are fully operational in&#13;
all DPEP I states and Madhya Pradesh. The physical implementation modules are&#13;
expected to be operational in all states by July 1996. UP is well advanced in establishing&#13;
establishing a PMIS similar to the DPEP system. At the state and national level, the&#13;
district data are aggregated and complemented by data on state level and national level&#13;
activities. While information can be made available in great detail, a set of key indicators&#13;
have been agreed which would be attached to every progress report and would provide&#13;
the key parameters for monitoring the implementation progress of project activities.&#13;
National reports would be desegregated to the state level and state progress reports would&#13;
be desegregated to show district level information. A set of model tables is presented in&#13;
attachment I to this Annex.&#13;
4.           EMIS. The School Statistics MIS, known as the Education Management&#13;
Information System is operationalized since September 1995. It collects information on&#13;
key education indicators on the basis of a questionnaire that is to be completed by every&#13;
headmaster in the country. Block and district education personnel are to check the&#13;
accuracy of the data. Inputting of data takes place at the district level. Aggregations take&#13;
place at the state and national level. District specific data can be extracted from the&#13;
national data base as needed. DPEP would extract data from the national data base to&#13;
monitor trends in enrollments, teacher deployment and classroom availability. The&#13;
enrollment data will be broken down in male/female and SC/ST and others to monitor&#13;
progress toward the project's equity objectives. A set of model tables is shown in&#13;
attachment 2 to these Annex.&#13;
5.          MRE.  The monitoring, research and evaluation system  has been&#13;
designed, first, to measure progress toward the DPEP objectives for learning achievement&#13;
through surveys of student learning which will be administered to a sample of students in&#13;
each of the project districts. A baseline survey DPEP is carried out in each project&#13;
district as a precondition for joining DPEP. This survey will be repeated every third and&#13;
six year to allow to monitor progress in student learning over time. The survey has been&#13;
carried out in 12 districts in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa, and it will be carried&#13;
out in the expansion districts as they join DPEP II under the eligibility criteria shown in&#13;
&#13;

Annex 8. A schedule for repeater surveys will be prepared and discussed with IDA by&#13;
December 31, 1997.&#13;
6.          The survey also collects information on a large number of potential&#13;
correlates of student achievement. Analysis of these data will help explain variations in&#13;
student achievement and identify the most effective interventions. DPEP I includes&#13;
significant funding to support research studies that will exploit this data base and analyze&#13;
the findings in-depth. A set of model tables is shown in Attachment 3 to these Annex.&#13;
7.          The survey research will be complemented by research and evaluation&#13;
studies that will investigate education process issues through specific program&#13;
evaluations and a series of qualitative studies including classroom observations. Much of&#13;
the technical support for the research work is concentrated in the research cell of the&#13;
TSG. Furthermore NCERT has developed a good capacity to support the implementation&#13;
of learning achievement studies carried out by the states with the support of DPEP I&#13;
technical assistance. To deepen the understanding of the achievements of DPEP and the&#13;
obstacles encountered on the way, a special monitoring program will be implemented in&#13;
10 project districts with the support of the EC.&#13;
8.          Conclusion.  In sum the objectives of the DPEP program  will be&#13;
monitored through a variety of ways and at different intervals. PMIS data will be&#13;
available quarterly, EMIS data annually, achievement survey data once every three years,&#13;
research and evaluation reports as needed, and progress reports twice a year. The table&#13;
below summarizes the source of information for the monitoring of the program&#13;
objectives.&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Project Management&#13;
1.          The innovative nature of DPEP required a management structure with&#13;
good policy access, substantial authority, a high degree of flexibility in appointing staff&#13;
and consultants, strong professional competence, and access to good information on&#13;
program activities, accomplishments and problems. To meet these requirements, the&#13;
Department of Education has established a new organizational unit, the DPEP Bureau, to&#13;
serve as an intermediary organization to appraise, finance and supervise state and district&#13;
investment plans and AWPBs according to established criteria and procedures. The&#13;
DPEP Bureau is in turn assisted by a technical support group employed under contractual&#13;
arrangements to the DOE.  Through this contract, the DPEP Bureau has acquired&#13;
substantial flexibility with respect to appointment of temporary staff and consultants,&#13;
including levels of remuneration. The DPEP Bureau is governed by the General Council,&#13;
which reviews policies and progress annually, and the Project Board, which is fully&#13;
empowered for program implementation and financial approvals. The general structure is&#13;
summarized in Attachment 6.1.&#13;
National Structure and Functions&#13;
2.           National Elementary Education Mission.  A National Elementary&#13;
Education Mission (NEEM) has been set up, in keeping with India's National Policy on&#13;
Education 1986 as revised in 1992, with DPEP implementation at its core. The two&#13;
organs of NEEM are the General Council and the Project Board. NEEM is an&#13;
independent and autonomous unit of the Ministry of Human Resource Development,&#13;
vested with full powers in its sphere of work. The resolution for the constitution of the&#13;
Council and the Board was issued on August 30, 1995.&#13;
3.          Mission General Council. The General Council (GC) provides policy&#13;
direction to the DPEP and facilitates Center-State coordination. Chaired by the Minister&#13;
of Human Resource Development and comprising 35 members, the Council would meet&#13;
annually. At least 40% membership is non official and includes experts drawn from the&#13;
field of media; NGOs; Women Development; Tribal and Disabled Education; Education&#13;
Ministers of States implementing the program; the Member Education of the Planning&#13;
Commission; Secretaries of Central Government Departments of Education; Expenditure,&#13;
Women and Child Development; and Welfare and Information &amp; Broadcasting. The&#13;
Joint Secretary of the DPEP Bureau is the Member- Secretary of the Council.&#13;
4.           DPEP Project Board. The General Council is assisted by a 12 member&#13;
Project Board (PB), an empowered body assigned full financial and administrative&#13;
powers to implement the program. The PB is headed ex officio by the Central&#13;
Government's Education Secretary and members are Advisor (Education) Planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Commission; UJnion Secretaries or their representatives from the Departments of&#13;
Expenditure; Women and Child Development; Welfare and Information &amp; Broadcasting;&#13;
the Financial Advisor of the Department of Education; Directors of NCERT &amp; NIEPA;&#13;
and two eminent Educationists. The Joint Secretary of the DPEP Bureau is Member-&#13;
Secretary of the PB. The PB meets quarterly or earlier if requested by the Chairman.&#13;
The first meeting of the PB was held in January 1996, where the progress of DPEP was&#13;
noted.  Support of various departments and NGOs represented was offered to further&#13;
strengtheni the program. It was also agreed to delegate financial powers to the Member&#13;
Secretarv of the NEEM, along the lines of the powers delegated to the Director General&#13;
of the National Literacy Mission.&#13;
5.          The composition of the PB empowers it to exercise all financial and&#13;
administrative powers necessary for program planning and implementation and to ensure&#13;
that the necessary governmental approvals are processed expediently.  The broad&#13;
functions of the PB are to: (a) recommend policies in regard to DPEP; (b) consider annual&#13;
work plans and budgets received from the states and the DPEP Bureau, which would&#13;
include annlual work plans and budgets for contracts for program and technical support&#13;
services; (c) approve changes in norms for new program components and activities which&#13;
emerge over the course of implementation; (d) promote convergence of services; (e)&#13;
review DPEP progress on a quarterly basis; and (f) provide guidance to the DPEP&#13;
Bureau.&#13;
6.          DPEP Bureau. The DPEP Bureau is fully responsible to the PB and&#13;
Mission General Council for the implementation of the program within DPEP guidelines&#13;
and in consonanice with external financing agreements. The DPEP Bureau is headed by a&#13;
Joint Secretary in the Department of Education, reporting to the Secretary of Education of&#13;
the MHRD. The Joint Secretary of the DPEP Bureau (JS-DPEP), has the overall&#13;
responsibility for program implementation. including coordination with State Education&#13;
Secretaries., within approved guidelines and annual plans and budgets. The JS-DPEP has&#13;
the authority to approve consultants appointed by contractors for program and technical&#13;
services, as well as to request specific services through terms of reference.&#13;
7.          The DPEP Bureau has the responsibility and authority to appraise,&#13;
supervise and evaluate national, state and district sub-projects, to enter into contractual&#13;
arrangements and to approve staff to be appointed in the Technical Support Group (TSG).&#13;
It serves as the secretariat for the Mission Council and Project Board, and develops and&#13;
proposes policy and/' or program recommendations for approval. It closely supervises the&#13;
operations of the TSG. Each Director/Deputy Secretary is responsible for a functional&#13;
area and for coordinating with specific states.&#13;
8.          Through an internal arrangement within the department of Education, one&#13;
Joint Secretary, one Director and one Deputy Secretary from other externally aided&#13;
projects are helping with DPEP staffing from the very beginning. Sanctions were issued&#13;
for creation of a total of 44 posts in the Bureau as against 101 demanded during the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110-                           Annex 6&#13;
appraisal of DPEP I. The sanctioned posts include 3 Deputy Secretaries, 6 Under&#13;
Secretaries and I Section Officer. In addition one Under Secretary and one Support Staff&#13;
have been sanctioned for Internal Finance Division of the Ministry. At appraisal, a Joint&#13;
Secretary assisted by 1 1 officers, 12 support staff were in position. The staffing status of&#13;
higher level managers is given in Attachment 6.2.&#13;
9.          At appraisal, a condition for negotiations was agreed with DOE/GOI.&#13;
Originally, the condition was for the Expenditure Department (DE) of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF) to sanction additional full-time positions for one Joint Secretary and three&#13;
Deputy Secretaries in the DPEP Bureau needed to reach the staffing agreed for DPEP I.&#13;
This condition was modified to ensure that the additional DPEP Bureau positions be&#13;
created either by sanctioning of new posts by DE/MOF or through the redeployment of&#13;
the Department of Education's own resources. Of the four positions, two were filled by&#13;
DOE prior to negotiations and two Deputy Secretaries remain to be filled.  At&#13;
negotiations, GOI provided assurances that the remaining two Deputy Secretaries shall be&#13;
filled no later than March 31, 1997. The proposed expansion of DPEP envisages that the&#13;
Bureau would continue to be lean and gradually some of the tasks, such as project&#13;
supervision, would be transferred to the states.  Furthermore, at negotiations, GOI&#13;
provided assurances that it will progressively transfer responsibility for supervision of the&#13;
project from the DPEP Bureau to the SPOs in accordance with a plan satisfactory to IDA&#13;
(paras. 2.50 and 5.1(b)). The date at which the Borrower shall provide IDA with&#13;
evidence of the commencement of such transfer of responsibilities was agreed with GOI&#13;
during negotiations and set out in a supplemental letter.&#13;
10.         DPEP Program and Technical Assistance Services. The DPEP Bureau&#13;
is supported for program and technical services by a Technical Support Group procured&#13;
through a consulting firm, Education Consultants India Limited (Ed.CIL), a public sector&#13;
undertaking promoted by the Department of Education, selected by the DPEP Bureau on&#13;
a sole source contract procedure approved by IDA on an exception case basis. Ed.CIL&#13;
has set up a Technical Support Group (TSG), housed in a separate office, to assist the&#13;
Bureau. Professionals staffing TSG are contracted following norms and procedures&#13;
specified in the contract with Ed.CIL. Consultants are selected on the basis of their&#13;
experience and expertise in relation to the needs of the program. This arrangement,&#13;
which expires in March 1997, has facilitated recruitment of professionals and&#13;
engagements of institutional and individual consultants and enabled the DPEP Bureau to&#13;
meet additional staffing needs arising from increased responsibilities&#13;
11.         Consultants in TSG carry out annual work programs in supervision,&#13;
pedagogy and teacher training, procurement and disbursement, educational management&#13;
information systems (MIS), planning and management, appraisal, research and&#13;
evaluation, media, gender as integral components of the annual work plans and budgets&#13;
of the DPEP Bureau. The annual program and technical services work program of the&#13;
consulting firm includes financing for cooperative agreements which would be channeled&#13;
as pass through funds for program and technical consulting services. The consulting firm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 111 -                          Annex 6&#13;
also responds to requests from the DPEP Bureau for services arising from&#13;
implementation of national components, or from state implementation societies as&#13;
approved by the DPEP Bureau. Such services are financed through a separate line budget&#13;
arrangements authorized as part of each annual work plan and budget. Annual Budgets&#13;
for program and technical services are supplemented as needed by short-term consultants.&#13;
12.         The TSG staff contracted through Ed.CIL is directly managed and&#13;
supervised by the DPEP Bureau. Each Deputy Secretary in the Bureau has functional&#13;
responsibility for day to day operations of their corresponding cells in theTSG, as well as&#13;
for monitoring and evaluating the performance of his/her respective units and represents&#13;
the unit to the DPEP Bureau and PB for policy decisions. At the direction of the DPEP&#13;
Bureau, Ed.CIL establishes advisory groups and task forces for each functional area that&#13;
the Bureau deals with, to guide and review its activities. The structure of TSG is given in&#13;
Attachment 6.3.&#13;
13.         TSG has played the role of harnessing available expertise and bringing it&#13;
together to contribute to DPEP effectively. With the proposed expansion of DPEP, TSG&#13;
has been called upon to extend technical support in respect of planning assistance and&#13;
academic resource support to the new States. It has helped the processes of dissemination&#13;
of the DPEP I experience and initiated activities of the TSG under appraisal.&#13;
14.         For DPEP II the TSG arrangements would need to be continued to address&#13;
core and critical areas for DPEP assistance to states. GOI intends to continue the&#13;
procurement arrangement with EdCIL. A new contract would be submitted to IDA for&#13;
review by December 31, 1996 . This contract would be expected to specify that Ed.CIL&#13;
managed procurement would follow the procedures for the recruitment of consultant&#13;
services specified in the credit agreement and that IDA review requirements would fully&#13;
apply.&#13;
16.         Appraisal Unit. Under the supervision of the DPEP Bureau, the appraisal&#13;
unit's staff and consultants provide support for the appraisal of state and district&#13;
proposals. The anticipated appraisal workload is approximately 15-20 districts per&#13;
semester. Each state receives appraisal missions: (a) at the initiation of district and state&#13;
investment proposals preparation; (b) on completion of draft proposals; and (c) on&#13;
completion of revised proposals. The unit prepares the terms of reference and other&#13;
background material for the appraisal team. The team members are identified through a&#13;
careful selection procedure. The unit draws upon national expertise available in&#13;
educational planning and management, financing, special programs for women/girls and&#13;
SC/ST, and school effectiveness. The unit also undertakes appraisal of Annual Work&#13;
Plans and Budgets of DPEP states and districts on an annual basis and makes&#13;
recommendations to the Bureau. It also conducts a mid-year review, as the one carried-&#13;
out in December 1995, to check on financial and physical progress against annual work&#13;
plans and budgets and assess the mid-course adjustments required for program&#13;
implementation in each state.&#13;

17.          Supervision Unit. The unit organizes and staffs DPEP participation in bi-&#13;
annual joint supervision missions with program donors. In addition, it also organizes two&#13;
bi-annual DPEP internal supervision missions to each participating state. Individual unit&#13;
members are responsible for overall information pertaining to DPEP implementation for&#13;
each state, that is assigned to them. The unit therefore is the node where all functional&#13;
areas get linked. It provides logistic and academic support to the domestic as well as&#13;
joint supervision missions.&#13;
18.          MIS.  The unit manages the school statistics MIS and the project&#13;
monitoring system (PMIS). The unit also imparts training to the states on using the&#13;
software developed. It also prepares monitoring reports on program implementation for&#13;
the DPEP Bureau.&#13;
19.          Procurement and Disbursement Unit. This unit is responsible to the&#13;
DPEP Bureau for managing national procurement and supervising procurement by states&#13;
and districts according to guidelines. It provides clarification to and orients project states&#13;
on these matters as well as assists them in setting up procurement procedures. It also&#13;
monitors the advance of funds and expenditures, prepares quarterly disbursement&#13;
requests, and ensures timely completion of audit reports.&#13;
20.          Civil Works Unit.   This unit is responsible for identifying  and&#13;
disseminating best practices in school construction designs and materials, appraisal of&#13;
state and district civil works proposals, and supervise construction, ensuring conformity&#13;
with national norms and safety standards. The unit assists the states in implementation of&#13;
the civil works plans, monitors execution of the plans and organizes dissemination of&#13;
innovative design and construction concepts.&#13;
21.          Research and Evaluation Unit. This unit seeks proposals for research&#13;
and evaluation from  appropriate agencies and evaluates them.   It conducts or&#13;
commissions higher level statistical analysis on various sample survey data. It reviews&#13;
studies conducted by state or districts and provides technical support. It also aims to&#13;
create and promote a strong institution base for action research and orient individuals/&#13;
institutions at all levels for research in primary education. It commissions specific&#13;
studies and has developed a manual on procedures for conducting research.&#13;
22.          Pedagogy and Teacher Training Unit.  The unit is responsible to&#13;
provide technical resource support for renewal of pedagogic practices, particularly&#13;
textbooks, teaching learning materials and in-service teacher training. It also extends&#13;
support to states to strengthen academic resource institutions at all levels and helps&#13;
networking with NGOs and eminent resource persons. The unit also addresses issues&#13;
related to gender and tribal education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -                          Annex 6&#13;
23.         Planning and Management Unit. This unit renders assistance in project&#13;
preparation and planning. It also provides directly, or organizes, assistance in the&#13;
preparation of Annual Work Plans and Budgets of the states. It assists in planning and&#13;
designing of intervention programs and supervises the training and orientation of state&#13;
and district level functionaries in terms of building their capacity for planning and&#13;
management. In providing resource support, the unit also facilitates the networking of&#13;
DPEP within and outside the government system. It also seeks to build institutional&#13;
capacity and linkages for educational management at the national and state levels.&#13;
24.         Media Unit. This unit brings out a monthly newsletter, "DPEP Calling",&#13;
which is an effective tool for information sharing. It carries articles and analyses of&#13;
various issues and helps build a common perspective. Many of the states have launched&#13;
their own DPEP newsletter.&#13;
State Level Structures&#13;
25.         State Implementation Societies (SISs).  The DPEP is implemented&#13;
through a registered SIS in each state. Registered societies are empowered, legal entities&#13;
registered under the Societies Registration Act of 1860. Such mechanisms have been&#13;
applied in India to implement time-bound projects for 130 years; they have earlier been&#13;
used for basic education projects in Bihar (1991), Rajasthan (1992) and Uttar Pradesh&#13;
(1993). DPEP I has set up societies in all seven states, namely Assam, Haryana, Madhya&#13;
Pradesh, Maharahstra, Kamataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala and they have been&#13;
implementing the program for 2 years with prompt decision making, smooth fund flow&#13;
and responsive management.&#13;
26.         Each SIS is accountable to a General Council chaired by the Chief&#13;
Minister or Education Minister of the State and an Executive Committee chaired by the&#13;
Chief Secretary/Education Secretary of the State. Membership in both bodies includes&#13;
representatives from other State Government departments and the GOI. Eminent&#13;
educationists and experts in women's education, education for socially disadvantaged&#13;
groups and disabled children have been included as non official members.&#13;
27.         SISs have three main advantages over conventional bureaucratic&#13;
structures. First, as parastatal bodies, they have administrative flexibility combined with&#13;
public accountability.  Second, representation of several Departments of the State&#13;
Government and the Central Government on the governing bodies of the SISs facilitate&#13;
planning  policy and coordination.  Third, financial transactions are efficient and&#13;
transparent.&#13;
28.         Registered SISs receive funds from the GOI and State Governments&#13;
directly and can disburse funds to the operational level of the project through bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -                          Annex 6&#13;
transfers. Under DPEP, these transfers are made to district-level implementing bodies on&#13;
the basis of the annual work programs and budgets.&#13;
29.         Regular Executive Committee and General Council meetings are being&#13;
held to review progress and help implementation of DPEP in the states/districts. The&#13;
focus of the first few meetings has been on finalisation of rules and regulations, staffing&#13;
and deputation; designing of intervention strategies; and a review of the status of the&#13;
program.&#13;
30.         Though the Bank is extending credit, the GOI has, for the first time,&#13;
decided to transfer funds to the societies as grant-in-aid and not loans. This demonstrates&#13;
the significance GOI attaches to DPEP.&#13;
31.         State-level management structures. According to their memoranda of&#13;
association, Executive Committees of state societies are authorized to create posts for&#13;
management of the project. The actual management arrangement in each state and&#13;
district level varies with local conditions. Management structures proposed for DPEP&#13;
have many common features, however, including small staffs, linkages with State&#13;
Departments of Education and other related departments, support for accounting and&#13;
financial management at the state and district level, and consultancies for accessing&#13;
expertise in key functional areas.  Attachment 6.4 shows a typical state management&#13;
structure.&#13;
32.         DPEP SISs employ both staff who are on deputation from  other&#13;
organizations and those who are directly recruited by the Society. The terms and&#13;
conditions of employment with the SIS are governed by administrative and service&#13;
regulations which have been framed under the powers provided in the Memorandum of&#13;
Association and Rules and/or Service Regulations of the registered SIS.&#13;
District Level Management&#13;
33.         DPEP is implemented at the district level through units of the SIS, as&#13;
provided for in the Memoranda of Asociation and Rules of each registered SIS. The&#13;
Societies' Executive Committees are empowered to specify the composition, functions&#13;
and powers of the district management structure. While states vary in the specifics of the&#13;
district level management structures, they share common features (Attachment 6.5).&#13;
District level bodies interact with the Panchayati Raj structures - the Zilla Parishad&#13;
(District Board), the village Panchayats - and with Village Education Committees (VEC),&#13;
which plays a major role in educational management, supervision and monitoring at the&#13;
village/school level.  Staff of the Department of Education posted in the district,&#13;
including supervisory officials and functional specialists, work closely with the district&#13;
DPEP units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -                          Annex 6&#13;
34.         District Committees.  All districts have established a district DPEP&#13;
Committee, headed by the District Collector or Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla&#13;
Parishad, with representatives from the district education department, non-governmental&#13;
organizations as well as functional specialists. The district DPEP Committee reviews the&#13;
progress of DPEP in the district and widens networking with participating agencies.&#13;
35.         District Task Force. All the districts have established a District Task&#13;
Force which is the executive body at the district level, and to whom well-defined powers&#13;
are delegated. Its membership includes district-level officials and representatives of local&#13;
non governmental organizations and resource institutions.&#13;
36.         District Project Offices. These have been established in all the districts.&#13;
In most cases, the district education officer is also the District Primary Education Officer.&#13;
Day-to-day implementation is overseen by a full-time district project coordinator. A&#13;
finance/procurement officer, civil works staff and assistant project coordinator for&#13;
training and gender programs would be in place byAugust 31, 1996. Each district has&#13;
constituted a planning team.&#13;
37.         Village Education Committees (VECs). Notifications about formation&#13;
of VECs have been issued in all the states. The powers and functions of VECs have also&#13;
been delineated. VECs have been constituted and have undergone orientation training&#13;
given by the state. The constitution of VECs is more or less similar across states and&#13;
includes the gaon panchayat president, head teachers, headmasters, NGO representatives,&#13;
members of panchayat, and representative of parents/guardians of the village. Seats are&#13;
earmarked for women representatives.&#13;
38.         The overall linkages within DPEP across various levels and institutions is&#13;
reflected in Attachment 6.6, where it can be seen at the district level.  The&#13;
implementation of DPEP is carried out in close coordination with the State Department of&#13;
Education, while at the same time, full-time staff is dedicated to DPEP.&#13;
Management, Planning and Control&#13;
39.         The process for management planning and control is summarized in&#13;
Attachment 6.7. Slightly different procedures are followed for the preparation and&#13;
appraisal of district and state investment proposals.&#13;
40.         District Investment Proposals. In accordance with the DPEP Guidelines&#13;
(Annex 8), district teams develop district action plans with popular participation (Annex&#13;
15). TSG has been providing technical assistance in the preparation of district-level&#13;
annual work programs and budgets (AWPBs). After AWPBs have been prepared, the&#13;
SIS reviews these plans and determines whether or not revisions are needed. If they are,&#13;
the AWPBs are sent to the district team(s) for modifications. When the AWPBs have&#13;
been suitably prepared, they are combined with the state-level AWPB and sent forward to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -                         Annex 6&#13;
the DPEP Bureau for review.  The  DPEP Bureau then assigns the task of formnal&#13;
appraisal to the appraisal unit of TSG. Based on the recommendation and detailed&#13;
analysis of TSG, the DPEP Bureau then holds discussions with the SIS. The DPEP&#13;
Board reviews the package and either approves or sends the proposals back for further&#13;
revision. If the DPEP Board approves the state package, it authorizes the advancements&#13;
of funds to the SIS; a sample of district AWPBs would be shared with IDA.&#13;
41.         State Investment Proposals. State investment proposals for institutional&#13;
capacity building are prepared in accordance with DPEP Guidelines (Annex 8) and with&#13;
assistance from national support institutions if needed. State-level AWPBs are submitted&#13;
to the DPEP Bureau, which assigns the TSG the task of formal appraisal. Again, if&#13;
revisions are needed, the proposals are remanded to the state and or else, the DPEP&#13;
Bureau issues approval in conjunction with the entire state package. National investment&#13;
proposals for institutional capacity and technical assistance to DPEP are developed by&#13;
national level institutions. National technical assistance program are being implemented&#13;
by NCERT for curriculum development and in-service teacher training; educational&#13;
planning and management by NIEPA; appraisal and supervision by LBSNAA; and&#13;
distance education by the Indhira Gandhi National Open University. All of the above-&#13;
mentioned technical assistance is carried-out on a project basis under the umbrella&#13;
contract with EdCIL at the instance of the DPEP Bureau.&#13;
Flow of Funds&#13;
42.         DPEP Guidelines require that total project costs be shared between the&#13;
GOI and the state in the ratio of about 80:15. The GOI share appears in the Annual Plan&#13;
and Budget of Department of Education (DOE) of the MHRD of the GOI. The state's&#13;
contribution is provided for in the Annual Plan and Budget of its Education Department.&#13;
43.         Funds from the GOI to the SISs. Advances from the GOI to the SISs&#13;
are made twice annually. Grants to SISs are made directly through a check or demand&#13;
draft by the Pay and Accounts Section of the DOE/GOI, with the funds deposited in a&#13;
bank account established by the SIS. Reimbursement claims from the multilateral and&#13;
bilateral agencies are made by DPEP Bureau based on expenditure statements received&#13;
from the SIS. Because the advances are deposited into the accounts of the SIS, unspent&#13;
balances at the end of the GOI fiscal year (March 31) do not have to be returned or&#13;
adjusted against subsequent advances, which is an important advantage of the SIS. In&#13;
principle, any state or district fully expending the first advance through exceptional&#13;
implementation could receive a larger second advance.&#13;
44.         Release of funds to DPEP SISs occurs every six months.  The first&#13;
installment for six months' operating expenditures is made on May 30. It is based on: (a)&#13;
district and state Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPB) prepared and appraised&#13;
during the preceding December - January; and (b) evidence of appropriate use of&#13;
previously released funds ("utilization certificates" for years 2-7 of the project). The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117 -                           Annex 6&#13;
second installment of six months' operating expenditures is made on January I and is&#13;
adjusted against actual expenditures from the first advance. This second installment is&#13;
based on: (a) evidence that the state had made its matching release of funds to the SIS; (b)&#13;
"utilization certificates"; and (c) the review by the GOI Education Secretary of&#13;
satisfactory progress in implementation of the approved work plans. The second advance&#13;
carries the program until the next June 1, overlapping (by two days) the availability of&#13;
date of the first advance for the subsequent year.&#13;
45.          Funds from  SISs to states/districts for personnel.   Appointing&#13;
authorities (in some cases state governmnents, in other cases district administrations) are&#13;
reimbursed by the SIS on a quarterly basis for the salaries of teachers in new posts&#13;
resulting from the construction of DPEP financed schools and classrooms, and as justified&#13;
by dropout reduction and increased enrollments resulting from DPEP activities.&#13;
Reimbursement would be on a declining basis as per IDA norms against list providing&#13;
names of teachers, name of school, date of appointment, and monthly salary. Both state&#13;
and district bodies are empowered to receive such reimbursements and to credit them on&#13;
the revenue side of their budgets.&#13;
46.          Funds from  SIS to Districts, Blocks, Villages and Schools.  Each&#13;
society has established rules and regulations for financial flows in its memoranda of&#13;
association, rules and financial regulations. The rules govern formulation of budget,&#13;
purchase procedures, delegation of financial powers, investment of funds, maintenance of&#13;
accounts and audit, and travel and per diem  allowance.  The Society Executive&#13;
Committee is empowered to open bank accounts, authorize a Drawing and Disbursing&#13;
Officer to operate the accounts, and delegate financial functions to state, district, block,&#13;
village and school levels. The Financial Regulations govern delegation of financial&#13;
authority for purchasing goods and services, writing checks against society bank&#13;
accounts, and procedures for releasing funds to district level DPEP offices.&#13;
47.          Specific mechanisms vary across states. However, DPEP SISs typically&#13;
have opened a bank account in a nationalized bank in which to deposit all funds received.&#13;
SISs have also opened bank accounts in one of the nationalized banks at the district level&#13;
and in banks or post offices at the block and village level. Funds are advanced to districts&#13;
through crossed Bank Drafts to the district-level bank account; payments to block and&#13;
village level DPEP cooperating institutions are made by crossed bank drafts. Districts are&#13;
advanced funds on the basis of annual work plans and budgets as approved by the state&#13;
DPEP society Executive Committee. Funds are released in installments after ensuring&#13;
that the first installment released has been utilized satisfactorily.&#13;
Accountability and Auditing&#13;
48.          Accountability and auditing are ensured through established state and GOI&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA in accordance with the provisions of the Societies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118 -                           Annex 6&#13;
Registration Act 1860, and following standard IDA guidelines for audits of project&#13;
accounts and Statements of Expenditure.&#13;
49.         Accounts in SISs. All DPEP SISs have established financial regulations,&#13;
similar to those established under the Lok Jumbish and Bihar Education Projects, which&#13;
detail procedures for the purchase of goods and services, including rules for purchase,&#13;
receipts, custody and accounting procedure for stores.&#13;
50.         Accounts in the State. All states have developed general financial rules&#13;
that establish an overall regulatory framework for the financial management of&#13;
governmental and quasi-governmental organizations, including DPEP SISs. These rules&#13;
provide for the purchase and procurement of goods and services, and include tendering&#13;
procedures for obtaining goods and services of acceptable quality at reasonable rates. For&#13;
DPEP, procurement, services and financial regulations to be adopted by implementing&#13;
societies are prepared and provided to IDA for review.  In addition, each state&#13;
government enters into a Project Agreement with IDA. The Memoranda of Association&#13;
of all DPEP SISs (including the one for the UPBE) provide that the Societies shall: (a)&#13;
maintain proper accounts and other relevant records; and (b) prepare annual accounts&#13;
comprising receipts and payments and statement of liabilities as may be prescribed by the&#13;
Registrar of Societies in that particular state.&#13;
51.         Audits in the SISs. Internal audit functions have been established in&#13;
DPEP SISs. The accounts of the society would be audited by an independent Chartered&#13;
Accountant in accordance with the provisions of the Societies Registration Act 1860. The&#13;
audited accounts along with a copy of the audit report and society annual report would be&#13;
furnished to the Executive Committee, which would comment and submit it to the state&#13;
government. The state government would comment on the audit report received from the&#13;
DPEP SISs and would submit it to GOI for acceptance. State governments would also, as&#13;
required, place these documents in the state legislatures.&#13;
52.         GOI Audits. The accounts of the SISs would be audited by the&#13;
Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, under the provisions (duties, powers&#13;
and conditions of service) of the Comptroller.and Auditor General Act, 1971 as amended.&#13;
The Act also provides for special audits of societies, which would be undertaken as&#13;
necessary. In addition, the GOI is required to send the annual report and audited&#13;
statement of accounts of the project to the Parliament on an annual basis.&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Management Development Plan&#13;
Lessons from DPEP I Implementation Process&#13;
1.          Planning Process.  The District Primary Education Program  (DPEP) has been&#13;
developed as an intermediary organisation to appraise, finance and supervise investment proposals&#13;
proposed and implemented by states, districts and national technical resource institutions. Program&#13;
structures, procedures and management capacity, had been developed over an 18-month period for&#13;
DPEP I (Table 7.1). The preparation of the IDA-financed DPEP I credit provided an extended&#13;
opportunity for learning by doing, enabling national, state and district planning and management&#13;
teams to implement the activities required to complete a project preparation cycle. Technical&#13;
support for the process was provided by faculty from the National Institute of Educational Planning&#13;
and Administration (NIEPA) and the National Council for Educational Research and Training&#13;
(NCERT), through formal and informal training.&#13;
2.           With the experience gained in DPEP I, the preparation process for DPEP II states has&#13;
been streamlined, especially in participative and decentralised planning process and preparation of&#13;
Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPBs). The DPEP Bureau and its Technical Resource Group&#13;
(TSG) have rendered planning assistance to the three new DPEP II states through a series of missions&#13;
and workshops and have closely assisted in building state capacity for investment proposals&#13;
preparations. The training workshops and missions have focused on analysis of key issues and&#13;
problems, linking strategies with identified problems, analysis of cost effectiveness of alternative&#13;
solutions, formulating strategies for implementation of key program components (pedagogy&#13;
improvement; ECE; primary formal and non-formal education; education strategies for girls and&#13;
SC/ST students; state and district educational management; monitoring and evaluation; and&#13;
institutional development), and procedures for operationalisation of strategies, phasing, sequencing&#13;
and costing of activities. As a result, the proposed district and state-level investment proposals are&#13;
more coherent, holistic and realistic. Schedule of key management development activities is given in&#13;
Table 7.2.&#13;
Management Readiness&#13;
3.           Program implementation for DPEP I started at the time of project negotiations. The&#13;
DPEP management team had completed an ambitious project studies program, prepared a national&#13;
program management structure, and appraised proposals for action programs in 42 districts of seven&#13;
states, as well as national technical assistance programs. All legal actions needed to establish program&#13;
structures at national, state and district levels had been completed. Procedures for advance of funds&#13;
and accounting had been established at all levels of the program. A contract with Ed.CIL for&#13;
technical and management support services for the DPEP Bureau in the Department of Education,&#13;
to conclude in March 1997, had been approved by IDA on a one-time exceptional basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -                               Annex 7&#13;
4.           The mechanism  of establishing autonomous SISs for DPEP has confirmed its&#13;
advantages over traditional bureaucratic structures (Annex 6). SISs have administrative flexibility&#13;
and greater public accountability thus facilitating quicker decision making. Representation of key&#13;
departments of the State and Central Governments results in greater convergence of programs.&#13;
Financial flows in a society are smoother, quicker and transparent.&#13;
5.           Key staff had been appointed in the DPEP Bureau for the implementation of DPEP I.&#13;
This staff has been involved in the appraisal of 12 districts in three new states of DPEP II, and will&#13;
continue assisting the implementation of DPEP II in 50 to 60 expansion districts in the seven DPEP I&#13;
states and Uttar Pradesh.&#13;
6.           The three new DPEP II states have made significant progress in preparing their state&#13;
and district investment proposals. The SISs have been registered with similar norms, rules and&#13;
regulations as followed in DPEP I, in all three new states. Key management positions have been filled.&#13;
All baseline studies and at least two district-social assessment studies per state have been completed,&#13;
with the remaining ones to be completed by effectiveness. Three state- and 12 district- investment&#13;
proposals in the three new states, as well as the national distance education component to support the&#13;
ongoing DPEP in-service teacher training activities, have been appraised by the DPEP Bureau.&#13;
DOE/GOI has already advanced pre-project funds to the three recently created and registered SISs.&#13;
The activities financed under the national management support structure of DPEP I have already been&#13;
extended to cover DPEP II states.&#13;
7.           AWPBs of states and districts under DPEP II have been prepared, reviewed and&#13;
appraised during the pre-appraisal and appraisal missions of the DPEP Bureau, which in turn were&#13;
appraised by IDA missions. Based on the recommendations of the preappraisal and appraisal&#13;
mnissions, the investment proposals have been further improved with the technical assistance of TSG&#13;
and the DPEP Bureau. The MIS and PMIS developed for DPEP I would be replicated for DPEP II&#13;
states. All cost data would be computerised in the database formats already established under DPEP&#13;
I.&#13;
Continuing Management Development&#13;
8.           The DPEP Bureau. The DPEP Bureau has been established to: (i) appraise, evaluate,&#13;
finance and supervise national, state and district investment proposals; (ii) enter into arrangements for&#13;
technical assistance for DPEP support; and (iii) service the national management structure. The&#13;
DPEP Bureau plays a facilitative role in finalising AWPBs and releasing state and district funds. It&#13;
co-ordinates with SISs, State Governments and GOI for policy matters in project implementation and&#13;
its participation in the Executive Committee meetings of the SIS facilitates quick decision making.&#13;
The  Bureau  also arranges technical support in functional areas, develops and coordinates&#13;
implementation of national component through national and international assistance. It provides an&#13;
interface for co-ordination between national institutions and the TSG, and also with external funding&#13;
agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -                               Annex 7&#13;
9.           The staffing levels of the DPEP Bureau are therefore crucial for program performance&#13;
and development. At present the DPEP Bureau is substantially better staffed compared to when&#13;
DPEP I was in the planning stage. However, the levels of staffing envisaged and agreed upon at&#13;
the finalisation of DPEP I have not fully been met. It is to the credit of an experienced and effective&#13;
team at the DPEP Bureau, that DPEP II has been planned, processed and successfully appraised in a&#13;
time bound manner while simultaneously continuing to support, develop and supervise DPEP I. To&#13;
fiully achieve the potential of the DPEP Bureau, it is necessary to attain the staffing position of DPEP&#13;
I level. At negotiations, the GOI provided assurances that it will maintain the DPEP Bureau in its&#13;
DOE, with responsibility to coordinate project implementation, with adequate staff, resources and&#13;
facilities (paras. 2.48, 2.49 and 5.1(a)). A detailed staffing schedule for the DPEP Bureau was&#13;
agreed with the Borrower during negotiations and set out in a supplemental letter.&#13;
10.          The Technical Support Group (TSG). The TSG functions to support the Bureau&#13;
and the DPEP Program at large. The role of the TSG is to render technical assistance on the basis of&#13;
the needs and requirements of the participating states and districts. Recognising the importance of&#13;
capacity building of the institutions at various levels, the TSG conducts workshops and training&#13;
programs and undertakes assistance missions to states and districts. It also organises and undertakes&#13;
supervision and appraisal tasks for the Bureau. The TSG offers a flexible arrangements to hire&#13;
professional expertise in response to the needs of the program. The TSG extends review, technical&#13;
advise and documentation support to the Bureau.&#13;
11.          The present strength of TSG is 22 full-time consultants and 25 support staff&#13;
distributed over the areas of: supervision; pedagogy and in-service teacher training; procurement and&#13;
disbursement; MIS and PMIS; planning and management; civil works; appraisal; research and&#13;
evaluation; media; and educational interventions for girls and SC/ST students. Short-term consultants&#13;
for specific projects are taken from time-to-time. Consequently the number of staff is not fixed and&#13;
keeps varying.&#13;
12.         With the expansion of DPEP, the TSG has been called upon to extend technical&#13;
assistance in respect of planning and academic resource support to the new states and expansion&#13;
districts under DPEP II as well. The TSG concept plays an important role addressing core and&#13;
critical areas for DPEP assistance to states during the implemtation of DPEP II. At negotiations, the&#13;
GOI provided assurances that it will maintain the TSG in its DOE, with responsibility to assist in the&#13;
coordination of project implementation, with adequate staff, resources and facilities (paras. 2.48, 2.49&#13;
and 5.1(a)). A detailed staffing schedule for the TSG was agreed with the Borrower during&#13;
negotiations and set out in a supplemental letter. In addition, DOE.!GOI has informed IDA of its&#13;
intention to retain the services of Ed.CIL as the procurement agent for consulting and related&#13;
services. Ed.CIL would apply procurement procedures for the recruitment of consultant services&#13;
specified by the DCA. A draft contract would be submitted for review to IDA by December 31,&#13;
1996.&#13;

Management of DPEP Expansion&#13;
13.          Decentralisation of Planning and Management Capacity. With the expansion of&#13;
DPEP from seven states in 1994 to 13 states by 1995 (seven DPEP I states, three new DPEP II&#13;
states, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal) and the proposed extension to additional&#13;
districts in a phased manner, the pressure and expectations of the Program from the National&#13;
Management Structure would continue to increase. There are different levels of expectations with&#13;
respect to start up and mid-course implementation, as well as demands from particular functional&#13;
areas. Therefore a system is envisaged whereby the national support would gradually roll away in&#13;
certain areas after playing its catalytic role and ensuring that capacities have been created and built up&#13;
at regional, state and other decentralised levels. The DPEP management design has already begun&#13;
investing in creating institutional capacities through SIEMTs and other such arrangements in the&#13;
states under DPEP to ensure capacity for planning and management. During appraisal, DOE/GOI&#13;
agreed to provide a staffing plan to strengthen the TSG to be discussed with the Bank at&#13;
negotiations.  At negotiations, GOI provided assurances that it will progressively transfer&#13;
responsibility for supervision of the Project from the DPEP Bureau to the SPOs in accordance with a&#13;
plan satisfactory to IDA  (paras. 2.50 and 5.1 (b)). The date at which the Borrower shall provide&#13;
IDA with evidence of the commencement of such transfer of responsibilities was agreed with GOI&#13;
during negotiations and set out in a supplemental letter.&#13;
14.          NIEPA is an apex institution extending support for capacity building in areas of&#13;
educational planning and management through organisation of training of trainers workshops,&#13;
developing module for planning and management, developing information systems and&#13;
documentation. It organises networking workshops with management and social research institutions&#13;
to enlarge the pool of resource expertise available for DPEP. The Bureau and TSG are pursuing and&#13;
concretising these linkages to support and strengthen management capacities. Networking with&#13;
regional level institutions is being pursued at the national level to further enhance decentralised and&#13;
continuous support in planning and management to the state projects and district implementation. A&#13;
similar design for capacity building in the areas of Quality Improvement and Research and Evaluation&#13;
is being followed.&#13;
15.          Delegation of Appraisal and Supervision Roles. DPEP supervision and appraisal&#13;
procedures have been consciously modeled on those of the World Bank. The DPEP Bureau through&#13;
its TSG has demonstrated an appreciative quality, on which IDA could base its own assessment of the&#13;
status of DPEP II. There is evidence that the national level has developed capacities to supervise and&#13;
appraise projects satisfactory to IDA expectations. These capacities have been built over three years&#13;
of DPEP preparation and implementation by way of joint participation in IDA, EC, ODA and other&#13;
national appraisal and supervision missions. At present, the Bureau is conducting all appraisals and&#13;
quarterly supervision missions, of which two are exclusively domestic. A pool of resource persons&#13;
and experts has been developed across the country through associated institutions. There exists the&#13;
capacity to transfer and build this expertise at state levels in the SIS as well as other resource&#13;
institutions. For appraisal of new districts and states coming into DPEP program, the Bureau would&#13;
in a phased manner, depending on state level capacities, shift the appraisal tasks of new districts to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -                               Annex 7&#13;
State Project Offices and in turn base its appraisal review on the state appraisal report. The Bureau's&#13;
appraisal reports would constitute the basis for appraisal by external funding agencies investing in&#13;
DPEP.&#13;
16.         Supervision of districts by the state level will be conducted on a regular basis. The&#13;
Bureau would in turn supervise the state supervision efforts with visits to sample districts and&#13;
continue to build decentralised capacities. External funding agencies would, through joint supervision&#13;
missions, annually review the DPEP supervision program (Annex 17). The DPEP Bureau would&#13;
mount another supervision mission in the year through national participation. This arrangement&#13;
would be modified for the new states and districts joining the program as capacities there would need&#13;
to be developed. Therefore, the Bureau in collaboration with the external funding agencies, would&#13;
continue to conduct biannual joint supervision missions to the newly added districts and states.&#13;
17.         The proposed IDA credit would assist in formalising these organizational structures&#13;
and procedures, and in the further development of management capacity. IDA staff based in the&#13;
Resident Mission provided continuing implementation support for the program, including formal&#13;
training in IDA procedures.&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
Context and Objectives&#13;
1.          The proposed Project would support district-based activities aimed at&#13;
improving access to quality primary education, reducing dropout and increasing learning&#13;
achievement. Special attention would be paid to girls, SC and ST students and students&#13;
with special educational needs. By the end of the Project, schools in the Project districts&#13;
would be inclusive schools where all children learn and achieve to their potential.&#13;
Participation of local communities in school management and mobilization of resources&#13;
would be enhanced to increase stakeholder ownership.&#13;
2.          To achieve the objectives outlined above the Project will support the&#13;
development of the capacity of the state, district and sub-district institutions to provide&#13;
technical support for textbook and supplementary reading material development,&#13;
improving teaching, evaluation and research, and planning and management in the three&#13;
new states. This implies strengthening in the expansion states the capacity of the&#13;
professional institutions (SCERT and SIEMT, Textbook Board), and at the national level&#13;
ensuring that there is an adequate base of resource institutions to support this process&#13;
(with support of national capacity building component in DPEP I). Furthermore, the&#13;
Project is desired to enhance district institutional capacity to plan and manage program&#13;
delivery, strengthen community participation and awareness, continuous in-service&#13;
training of teachers backed by on-site supervision and support, learning materials and&#13;
teaching aids, targeted interventions for girls, SC, ST and students with special education&#13;
needs. Inputs from line and parallel institutions including NGOs are critical for&#13;
implementation. Institutional development to perform specified roles in the changing&#13;
pedagogy and managerial environment would converge on school improvement and&#13;
effectiveness. A framework for institutional development in the three new states and in&#13;
expansion states is presented below.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
3.           Two institutional development lessons have been learned in the process of&#13;
implementing DPEP I. First, the establishment of state resource groups on curriculum&#13;
and learning material, and in-service teacher training is critical to the implementation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -                         Annex 10&#13;
the process of pedagogical renewal time delays. Second, the expedition of DIETs, block&#13;
resource centers (BRCs) and cluster resource centers (CRCs) need to be operationalized&#13;
early in the Project as training and on-site support depends on it. Sirnilarly, delay in&#13;
operationalisation of SIEMT, or the planning and management unit in an existing state,&#13;
results in lack of mobilization of managerial back-up for integrated school improvement&#13;
after in-service training. During negotiations, Project states agreed that each Project state&#13;
shall establish and maintain a state level technical resource group to assist in the&#13;
development and implementation of programs to improve primary education teaching&#13;
processes (paras 2.10 and 5.2(c)). The BRCs and CRCs will also be expected to start&#13;
operating in the first year so that the staff is involved in planning staff and teacher&#13;
development activities to stimulate ownership and program implementation commitment.&#13;
Similarly, at least core staff for SIEMT or a unit in an existing institution will be appointed&#13;
early on so that integrated teacher training and technically improved managerial support&#13;
will beavailable for school improvement and effectiveness.&#13;
4.           In DPEP I, the stress on building institutional capacity has been mostly on&#13;
technical assistance for training.   This, however, is not sufficient for effective&#13;
implementation of a complex program like DPEP. Training needs to be complemented by&#13;
sustained inputs through a variety of integrated activities such as, supervision and support,&#13;
supply of supplementary reading material, and teaching aids. Like DPEP I, the three new&#13;
states would identify resource institutions within or outside their state for specific tasks&#13;
and carry out systematic assessment of their capacities.&#13;
Strategies&#13;
5.           The institutional development strategy would have the following elements:&#13;
(a)   Identifying  resource  institutions  and  networking: The  resource&#13;
institutions and NGOs for specific tasks would be identified and their capacities&#13;
assessed and terms for collaboration or memorandum understanding would be&#13;
negotiated through a transparent process. Functional networks of institutions,&#13;
consulting firms and NGOs would be established.&#13;
(b)   Variety of arrangements:  Institutional capacity building goes beyond&#13;
training and workshops. Besides these activities, mentoring, twinning, information&#13;
exchange and on-site study visit within the state, outside the state in the country&#13;
and outside the country would be supported to develop institutional capacity.&#13;
Fellowships and longer training in critical areas would also be supported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147-                        Annex 10&#13;
(c)   Consultancies: Institutional capacity building at the state, district, BRC&#13;
and CRC levels will require technical resource support to complement the line&#13;
institutions to implement several activities in the expansion scenario.  The&#13;
necessary technical support consultancies would be supported by the Project.&#13;
(d)   National Technical Assistance Program (NTAP): The NTAP, included&#13;
in the DPEP I, Project is critical to the broad strengthening capacity of institutions&#13;
involved in the research, policy analysis, design and delivery of primary education&#13;
programs in India. A plan for funding the NTAP has been prepared for EC&#13;
funding. The DPEP Bureau will submit to IDA a revised plan for IDA funded&#13;
NTA to complement the EC to meet the demands of DPEP expansion&#13;
Implementation at the National Level&#13;
6           National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT):&#13;
NCERT is involved in pedagogical renovation, experimentation in innovative&#13;
pedagogical practices in primary and early childhood education, documentation and&#13;
dissemination of good practices, organizing training of SCERT and DIET faculty, and&#13;
research and evaluation. NCERT has been recently restructured to respond to the&#13;
increasing demand of DPEP. It has four Regional Institutes of Education that have been&#13;
assigned specific states for technical assistance. The faculty of the RIEs that were more&#13;
oriented to secondary education are to be reoriented to primary education. Role clarity&#13;
and its relationship with TSG would enhance NCERT contribution in capacity building in&#13;
line institutions. Specific DPEP activities identified by DPEP or activities identified by&#13;
NCERT and approved by DPEP Bureau would continue to be supported by the Project.&#13;
NCERT would carry out the following activities:&#13;
i transformation of the revised national MLL into a curriculum document by&#13;
December 1996 and providing technical assistance to states on demand to&#13;
undertake similar activity;&#13;
*  documentation and dissemination of good teaching practices (active learning&#13;
based and child centered), and participatory training methodologies and&#13;
practices, effective schools in action, innovative reading and mathematics&#13;
programs for teachers and master trainers in workable format of presentation&#13;
planned for DPEP I by December 1996 and continue on a yearly basis;&#13;
*   organize training and support for SCERT and DIET faculty working for&#13;
DPEP in textbook and supplementary reading material and in-service teacher&#13;
training; and&#13;
*   organization of the thematic international research seminar every year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -                         Annex 10&#13;
7.           National Institute  of Education  Planning  and  Administration&#13;
(NIEPA): NIEPA is involved in capacity building at the state and district levels in&#13;
planning and management. It would also support capacity development activities for&#13;
SIEMTs and planning and management units being established in existing institutions and&#13;
DIETS. NIEPA would continue to extend support to the three new states in developing&#13;
capacity in using EMIS and school mapping. It has initiated networking with relevant&#13;
institutions. NIEPA would assist the states to establish SIEMT/UNIT in the states on&#13;
demand and assist in capacity development program in these institutions, particularly in&#13;
microplanning and school mapping, preparation of district plans and AWPB using&#13;
participatory approach, document and disseminate innovative practices, analytic and&#13;
problem solving skills for planning and management in primary education. DPEPI would&#13;
continue to support the identified activities as agreed.&#13;
Implementation at the State Level&#13;
8.           State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT): The&#13;
capacity of SCERT to develop active learning-based textbooks and other learning&#13;
material, design training, develop training material, monitor training quality, provide&#13;
technical assistance to DEETs for building capacity to train master trainers, carry out&#13;
planning and management functions (Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh) and mobilize services&#13;
from networked institutions is critical to the overall success of DPEP. Yet in most states,&#13;
SCERT is not staffed with personnel that have the background or experience for these&#13;
tasks. DPEP will need to implement a program designed to strengthen SCERT to prepare&#13;
for the new challenges. This implies first a restructuring in SCERTs for DPEP activities.&#13;
During negotiations, Project states agreed that each Project state shall establish and&#13;
maintain a state level technical resource group to assist in the development and&#13;
implementation of programs to improve primary education teaching processes (paras 2.10&#13;
and 5.2(c)). The process of filling the vacant primary education posts is expected to be&#13;
conipleted by effectiveness. The skills required by the additional staff to be funded under&#13;
DPEP II and the method and time frame for recruitment have been specified in an annex in&#13;
the revised national appraisal reports (NSAR) submitted to IDA prior to negotiations.&#13;
9.           The SCERT will carry out the following activities:&#13;
identify and constitute pedagogy and teacher training resource group for&#13;
DPEP if the task is assigned to SCERT;&#13;
*     transform MLL into curriculum to provide guidelines for textbook writers&#13;
and teacher trainers by Juine 1997;&#13;
*     develop training package for teachers and master trainers, Diet staff and&#13;
organize training of trainers by December 1997. Training&#13;
package/modules for teachers in tribal areas will also be developed;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -                       Annex 10&#13;
*     prepare plans for review and development of MLL-based textbooks and&#13;
supplementary reading material with active involvement of teachers, and&#13;
link them with teacher training in its use in the classroom. Material to be&#13;
developed for tribal children will also be included. The plans would be&#13;
submitted to IDA by December 1996;&#13;
*     provide technical support to DIETs in conducting training of master&#13;
trainers and support and supervision to master trainers when participating&#13;
in teacher training programs;&#13;
*     build linkages with SIEMT/Units for interfacing teacher training and&#13;
training of education managers and VEC members to implement&#13;
integrated school improvement and effectiveness program; and&#13;
*     identify and coordinate resource institutions, NGOs and persons at the&#13;
state level for pedagogy renewal related tasks.&#13;
10.         State Institute of Educational Management and Training (SIEMT):&#13;
Two of the three new DPEP II states (Himachal and Orissa) have proposed the&#13;
establishment of a SIEMT. Gujarat has proposed a planning and management unit in the&#13;
SCERT. The construction of a building for SIEMT will take time. The director would be&#13;
involved in the design and furnishing of the building. The faculty would be oriented in&#13;
DPEP philosophy and the program. Another advantage would be that training of&#13;
education managers at different levels could be synchronized with in-service teacher&#13;
training of teachers. As a result it will be possible to link improved pedagogy and&#13;
managerial competence for school improvement and effectiveness. The Project would&#13;
also support civil construction, improvement of library, furniture and equipment, agreed&#13;
staff, vehicle, and opportunity for participation in national and international workshops&#13;
and seminars.&#13;
11.         The SIEMT will carry out the following activities:&#13;
*     develop strategic plans for the training of educational planners and&#13;
managers (from SPO, DPO, DIET planning and management branch,&#13;
district and block education officers) and trainers of VECs;&#13;
*     develop training packages for different target groups;&#13;
*     become an active partner in the network of institutes and NGOs working&#13;
in its operational area;&#13;
*     provide technical assistance and supervision of microplanning and school&#13;
mapping;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -                          Annex 10&#13;
*     conduct research on state specific primary education efficiency and&#13;
managerial issues; and&#13;
*     document and disseminate good managerial practices.&#13;
Implementation at the District and Subdistrict Levels&#13;
12.          District Institute of Education and Training (DIET):  DuETs train&#13;
master trainers for in-service training, provide support to BRCs to conduct training,&#13;
monitor quality of training, develop district specific learning material, assist SCERTs in&#13;
trialling textbooks and other learning material, and conduct research on district specific&#13;
issues. The Project would support agreed equipment, strengthening of library, limited civil&#13;
construction, a vehicle and a driver. During negotiations, Project states agreed that each&#13;
Project state shall establish and maintain DIETs or equivalent institutions in Project&#13;
districts and appoint key staff at such DIETs or equivalent institutions in accordance with&#13;
a schedule satisfactory to IDA, in any event not later than six months after the approval by&#13;
the DPEP Bureau of any investment proposal for financing Project activities in a Project&#13;
district (paras. 2.20 and 5.2(b)).&#13;
13.          The DIETS will carry out the following activities:&#13;
*     identify DIET staff who will be actively involved in DPEP activities,&#13;
particularly teacher training, district specific curriculum adaptation and&#13;
development of materials (like for tribal children, tribal teachers, migratory&#13;
population), curriculum and evaluation unit, planning and management unit.&#13;
Approach SCERT, SIEMT and other institutions or organizations in the&#13;
network for technical assistance to enhance individual and institutional&#13;
capacity;&#13;
*     organize training of master trainers from BRCs who are to provide training&#13;
to teachers, alternative schooling staff, ECCE instructors and VEC&#13;
members;&#13;
*     provide technical support and supervision to BRCs in training programs&#13;
conducted by them;&#13;
*     collect feedback on training at BRC and school cluster level and share with&#13;
SCERT, BRCs, and CRCs to improve subsequent training;&#13;
*     demonstrate  school effectiveness  and  improvement innovations  in&#13;
laboratory schools;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -                         Annex 10&#13;
*     develop district-specific supplementary learning material for special focus&#13;
groups like tribal children;&#13;
document and disseminate innovative training and teaching practices in&#13;
BRCs; and&#13;
conduct studies on district-specific issues of primary education at least two&#13;
times every years.&#13;
14.          Block Resource Centers (BRCs): BRCs would provide at least one week&#13;
residential in-service training to teachers, headmasters/headteachers and cluster resource&#13;
teachers every year. BRCs would also train supervisors of early childhood education and&#13;
non-formal education. The BRC is provided a training coordinator and two support&#13;
staff. The coordinator is complemented by at least two resource persons identified as far&#13;
as possible from the local area. The team is trained and supported by DIET. In the initial&#13;
training cycles, the BRC team should have one of the trainer of trainers for providing&#13;
support and quality of delivery in the cascade. The Project would support a BRC&#13;
coordinator, a clerk and an attendant, a small library, furniture and equipment, and&#13;
contingency and building. BRCs would be established as far as possible in the first year&#13;
of the Project.&#13;
15.          The BRC would organize the following activities:&#13;
identify at least 2-3 resource persons with background in primary teaching&#13;
as far as possible from nearby locality who can be mobilized for training&#13;
(even experienced retired primary teachers and headmasters can also be&#13;
considered) and get them trained at DIET;&#13;
*     prepare training schedules in consultation with DIET to make it possible&#13;
for DIET faculty to deploy a trainer offer assistance in, at least, the first&#13;
few courses;&#13;
coordinate with the BEO to release teachers in such a way that while&#13;
school approach to training could implemented for school improvement&#13;
and effectiveness;&#13;
*     provide support to CRCs in monthly training programs through at least bi-&#13;
monthly visits;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -                        Annex 10&#13;
*     assist CRCs to develop school cluster improvement program; and&#13;
Collect feedback on one-day training programs, collect further training&#13;
needs from teachers to be shared with BRCs and the DIET.&#13;
16.         Cluster Resource Centers (CRC): Being nearest to the school, the CRC&#13;
is critical for school improvement and effectiveness inputs. The cluster resource teacher&#13;
organizes monthly meetings of the satellite schools in the cluster in which teachers (a)&#13;
share experiences and innovations, and demonstrates good practices, (b) discuss problems&#13;
and solutions, and (c) transact new training, modules. In addition, the cluster resource&#13;
teacher is expected to visit schools at least once every two months for on-site supervision&#13;
and support. In-class demonstration and peer coaching are also organized. The CRC&#13;
would be provided a cluster resource teacher, a room wherever necessary, contingency to&#13;
organize monthly meetings, a small library, storage facility, and materials for making&#13;
learning aids and display boards. It was agreed that CRCs will be made functional as far&#13;
as possible in the first year.&#13;
17.         School: Inputs from all institutions described above converge on school&#13;
improvement and effectiveness. The Project would provide for improved physical&#13;
facilities, encourage community participation and local management through VECs. Each&#13;
school gets Rs. 500 per teacher annually for purchasing materials for making learning&#13;
aids and making teaching activity-based. Each VEC is also provided Rs. 2000 for school&#13;
improvement.  Each school will prepare a school improvement plan to increase&#13;
enrollment and attendance of children, and improve teaching to raise achievement of all&#13;
students.  The plan will be developed by teachers, VECs and students to ensure&#13;
ownership. In both staff and VEC meetings the results will be monitored and objectives&#13;
and strategies will be revisited. Each school will set its targets of enrollment, attendance&#13;
and achievement. These plans and the feedback could be shared in CRCs.&#13;
18.         Institutional development is a continuous activity which involves linkages&#13;
with both parallel and line institutions. It also requires policy decisions to come out of&#13;
the traditional bureaucratic mold. Developing a functional network of institutions and&#13;
making it work effectively is as challenging a task as it is complex. Systematic planning,&#13;
flexibility to operate, mutual trust, clear roles, good communication and transparency&#13;
tend to make it successful. The revised plan for capacity building and for additional&#13;
requirements has been included in the revised NSAR submitted to IDA prior to&#13;
negotiations. Priority for action are:&#13;
* establish state resource pedagogy group usually in SCERT and position a&#13;
director with small core team for SIEMT/ planning and management unit in&#13;
SCERT, and staff DIETs by December 31, 1996. Make BRCs and CRCs&#13;
fully operational by June 30, 1997; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -                        Annex 10&#13;
. review the capacity building plans to be funded by EC and additional&#13;
requirement from IDA funds. Provide revised plans to IDA by December 31,&#13;
1996. Identify resource institutions from within and outside the state for&#13;
specified tasks and establish a network of institutions by December 31, 1996.&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Quality Improvement&#13;
1.          Improving the quality of primary education is a crucial part of DPEP. This&#13;
will be brought about by major changes in the classroom. Of prime importance is the&#13;
introduction of child-centered pedagogy. For this to take place there will be major programs&#13;
of teacher training and both new curriculum and new teaching/learning materials will be&#13;
introduced in all the project districts. These activities are interdependent and must be subject&#13;
to regular evaluation and assessment.&#13;
2.          DPEP II state and district investment proposals include many of the building&#13;
blocks required for quality improvement. States have only limited understanding of the&#13;
amount of work required, the time that it will take to achieve and the number of skilled&#13;
personnel needed to carry it out.&#13;
3.          DPEP II states can learn from the experience of DPEP I states. They must&#13;
undertake a major process of exploration in order to discover what resources are available&#13;
within the state, elsewhere in India and abroad. These can be in the form of institutions,&#13;
individual specialists or groups of specialists and existing materials of all kinds (training&#13;
modules, textbooks, supplementary materials and so on). Exploration should not be limited&#13;
to the public sector, nor solely to the field of education.&#13;
4.          Thorough evaluation of all available experienceis essential. Once states have&#13;
decided which institutions, specialists and materials they can use they can then start a process&#13;
of experimentation. They should not tackle too many tasks in the first year of the project.&#13;
They should evaluate everything on a continuing basis. Only after ample trialling and&#13;
evaluation can state-wide implementation be considered.&#13;
5.          DPEP II aims at improving quality of education at the primary school by&#13;
implementing a strategy that acts concurrently on the following six elements: (a) curriculum;&#13;
(b) pedagogy; (c) staff; (d) teaching and learning materials; (e) assessment; and (f)&#13;
supervision and support.&#13;
CURRICULUM&#13;
6.          Of the three new states in DPEP II only Gujurat has so far adopted Minimum&#13;
Levels of Learning (MLL), and has already prepared competency based curriculum for&#13;
Classes I and II and introduced it on a trial basis. Himachal Pradesh and Orissa will be able&#13;
to make use of the revised document published by NCERT in December 1995 and plan to&#13;
complete state specific MLLs in the first year of the project. Once MLLs have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 155 -                          Annex 11&#13;
established, these states will prepare new curriculum which will constitute the core of both&#13;
teacher training modules and new teaching/learning materials.&#13;
7.          Participating DPEP II states must clearly understand that MLLs in themselves&#13;
do not constitute curriculum. They show the expected outcomes of the teaching/learning&#13;
process. Curriculum gives the route to be followed. MLLs, curriculum and teaching/learning&#13;
materials will be the subject of regular evaluation throughout the life of the project.&#13;
PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENT&#13;
8.          Baseline studies show low levels of learning achievement in reading and&#13;
mathematics in grade two, tendency to dropout of school after grade 3 and poor performance&#13;
in grade 5.&#13;
9.           DPEP aims to ensure achievement of the minimum levels of learning (MLLs)&#13;
for all children, including special focus groups, through pedagogical improvement. DPEP&#13;
will finance the training of teachers to respond to the diversity in the classroom arising due to&#13;
multi-age/multigrade teaching contexts.  DPEP will also finance the activities directed&#13;
towards transforming the existing teacher dominated pedagogy to a child centered active&#13;
learning based pedagogy. Continuous teacher development activities using "Whole school"&#13;
approach backed by professional on site supervision and support is essential to bring about&#13;
this transformation. Equally important is the substance in and quality of teaching learning&#13;
material to support this vision and classroom infrastructure to facilitate the considerations of&#13;
improved pedagogy.&#13;
10.         The state and district plans are directed towards initiating the actions and&#13;
processes for improved pedagogy in all the learning situations including formal classrooms,&#13;
as well as alternative schooling facilities. To sharpen the vision for practising improved&#13;
pedagogy, DPEP will finance during the first year of the project implementation, a sharing&#13;
and visioning exercise in each participating state, among state and district stakeholders&#13;
comprising best practices in the DPEP and non DPEP states. The results of this visioning&#13;
exercise would be translated into specific action financed by DPEP and are to be incorporated&#13;
in the development of a new generation of better quality textbooks and other teaching/&#13;
learning material and in the development of training modules and methodology for&#13;
transacting the same.&#13;
11.         The state and district plans have developed frameworks for actions to be&#13;
funded by DPEP in the form of strengthening of TSG at the state and substate level and other&#13;
resource institutes to assist participating states and districts in the development of focused&#13;
actions for improved pedagogy. Action research, visits and exposures to DPEP I states and&#13;
districts and documentation of practices are planned for funding and implementation in the&#13;
first year.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -                           Annex 11&#13;
IN-SERVICE TEACHER TRAINING&#13;
12.          The teacher training  component is directed  towards developing  the&#13;
competency of teachers, head teachers, instructors of alternative schooling, coordinators of&#13;
block resource centers (BRCs) and cluster resource centers (CRCs), and early childhood&#13;
education center (ECC) facilitators, village education committee (VEC) members and&#13;
members of technical support groups at state and subdistrict levels of the participating states.&#13;
The number runs into a few thousands in each state. The in-service teacher training strategy&#13;
proposed for DPEP II addresses the issues explained below.&#13;
13.          In-service teacher training issues. In the context of near minimal experience&#13;
of planning inservice training and staff development activities, the states plan to approach&#13;
this task incrementally along with building training capacity at all levels. The other issues&#13;
emerging from the experience of DPEP I relate to: (a) absence of exposure and access to best&#13;
practices in India and elsewhere, (b) lack of capacity within the districts and states to plan&#13;
and implement teacher training; (c) one and two teacher schools located in remote and&#13;
difficult terrain areas and their availability for training; (d) increased effectiveness of the&#13;
cascade model of training and maintaining the quality of training; and (e) substance, design&#13;
and production of training materials&#13;
14.          Strategy and Parameters of Training. The participating states and districts&#13;
plan to address these issues by incorporating the following parameters of training program&#13;
design and implementation. These are based on the principles of. (a) identifying and&#13;
prioritizing training inputs for improved school functioning following the whole school&#13;
approach and improved student learning; (b) ownership of training inputs by the&#13;
beneficiaries; (c) identifying and phasing the activities for development of modular training&#13;
structures and materials with appropriate linkages to relate to the contexts of trainees and&#13;
institutes and to the modes of delivery including distance education; and (d) catering to the&#13;
special education needs of the special focus groups as highlighted by the social assessment&#13;
studies. The proposed training will be supported by the distance education component of&#13;
DPEP II (paras. 2.42 to 2.45 of the SAR and Annex 12).&#13;
15.          Identifying and prioritizing training inputs. The participating states plan at&#13;
all levels to identify and prioritize training inputs in tune with the capacity building exercise&#13;
of resource institutions and groups and required action in the classrooms. DPEP will fund&#13;
documentation of good practices, documenting and developing training materials and putting&#13;
into place delivery systems for induction and in-service training for primary teachers, head&#13;
teachers and functionaries of alternative schooling in the first year. Actual training is not&#13;
planned for the first year. This has been staggered over the remaining period of the project.&#13;
16.          Second priority is given to the training of VEC members beginning from the&#13;
first year to tackle issues of access and retention and to addressing special groups. This&#13;
would also be funded under the project.  Other areas of funding are training in the&#13;
implementation of the management information system (MIS) for schools to be integrated in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-157 -                           Annex 11&#13;
induction and in service training of Block and Cluster level personnel and also district staff&#13;
within the first two years of the project.&#13;
17.         Ownership of training inputs.  The process for developing prototype&#13;
training inputs, training designs and sharing experiences by national level resource agencies&#13;
and the TSG is in place flowing from DPEP I implementation.&#13;
18.         DPEP II will finance organization of vision workshops and sharing seminars&#13;
to develop ownership strategies for interventions. At every stage emphasis would be on&#13;
learning, evaluating and adapting to suit the contextuality and reality of individual states and&#13;
districts. This exercise will flow at least in the district level.&#13;
19.         Phasing.  DPEP I experience has brought out the merits of trials and&#13;
continuous monitoring and feedback when rapidly moving to large-scale implementation of&#13;
and training inputs programs.&#13;
20.          DPEP II would fund activities related to development of exemplar training&#13;
materials, capacity building to try various training approaches (cascade model of DPEP I and&#13;
distance education under consideration for DPEP I and II) and other training activities. The&#13;
focus is on phasing of activities to build replicable and sustainable training delivery systems&#13;
through trials. These would take place in the first year of implementation.&#13;
21.          Modular Approach. Training modules are planned for each level of training&#13;
learning from the experience in DPEP I and Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Project.&#13;
22.         Training modules for teachers, head teachers, clusters and BRC coordinators&#13;
and also for supervisors of the primary education system will be funded, incorporating&#13;
modules from all lower levels for training of each successive higher level. This approach is&#13;
intended to facilitate better appreciation of inputs at each successive and preceding level, as&#13;
well as have a built in procedures for continuous revision and update based on continuous&#13;
feedback.&#13;
23.         Special Focus Groups. Gender Sensitivity and strategies for special focus&#13;
groups like SC/ST, disabled, nomads and girls are planned as integral components of all&#13;
training inputs. DPEP will fund special orientation training programs as per requirements&#13;
flowing from gender studies.&#13;
24.         Preparation for Training. DPEP would fund preparatory activities for&#13;
training, for identifying interventions for improved learner achievement and improved school&#13;
functioning, documentation and evaluation of available training materials and developing&#13;
training design and packages. This will include activities for documentation review,&#13;
development, trialling, review, modification and large-scale production and distribution of&#13;
training materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -                           Annex 11&#13;
25.          The agencies accountable for these activities are the: (i) state project office&#13;
(SPO); (ii) State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT); (iii) state technical&#13;
support group; (iv) DIETs; and (v) district technical support group. The national support&#13;
group and other resource institutions would facilitate capability building for initiating and&#13;
implementing these actions.&#13;
26.          The other aspects of preparation activities to be funded by DPEP are&#13;
developing role specifications of coordinators of BRC, CRC, TSG at state and subdistrict&#13;
levels, VEC members and supervisors from the school systems.&#13;
27.          Sharing and learning activities by way of visits to DPEP I states would also be&#13;
funded. This would result in the development of guidelines, training designs and packages&#13;
for training.&#13;
28.          Delivery of Training. Approximately 19,700 teacher trainers and 268,000&#13;
primary education teachers are targeted to receive about 25 days training and orientation&#13;
during the entire DPEP II implementation cycle. Initially, training would start from the&#13;
second year of the project with recurrent training opportunities in the total project period.&#13;
The substance of training relates to orientation and training towards DPEP goals and&#13;
objectives, capacity building for planning and implementation strategies for interventions&#13;
leading to improved learner achievement, material development in the first year of the&#13;
project. From the second year onwards the training plans include training of teachers for&#13;
improved classroom practices, facilitating achievement of learners against MLLs and&#13;
addressing educational needs of special focus groups. As shown by experience of the&#13;
UPBEP and DPEP I, all decisions with reference to training strategies continue to evolve as&#13;
the project progresses.&#13;
29.          A cascade model would be followed for delivery seeing to the experience of&#13;
DPEP I. It will finance training activities by SCERT with support from state TSG for master&#13;
trainers (DIET faculty and district TSG), district level training of key resource persons (BRC&#13;
and block TSFG) who in turn will conduct training of teachers, head teachers, CRC&#13;
coordinators and other identified functionaries. All activities for training of trainers will be&#13;
financed in the first year of the project.&#13;
30.          The training at all levels will incorporate the principles of active learning,&#13;
participatory training and problem solving to be in tune with the pedagogical interventions&#13;
planned for the improved classroom instruction. Whole school approach and supervision and&#13;
support are to be inbuilt in all training activities.&#13;
31.          Duration of training. Duration of training has been streamlined in view of&#13;
the lessons of UPBEP DPEP I. DPEP II will fund training of teachers and head teachers&#13;
(new as well as in service) five times over the project period for each teacher with five days&#13;
at any given time. This would be staggered over the years and would be mostly located at&#13;
BRC level. Also funded would be the training of VECs for 2-3 days, five times over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -                          Annex 11&#13;
project period at CRC level. Similarly, it would fund training of ECE workers and&#13;
alternative school functionaries.&#13;
TEACHING AND LEARNING MATERIALS&#13;
32.         The introduction of both new MLL-based curriculum and child centered&#13;
teaching and learning in the classroom means that existing teaching and learning materials&#13;
will need to be revised or preferably replaced.&#13;
33.          Requirements. New materials will have to satisfy a wide number of needs of&#13;
both teachers and children. They should:&#13;
(a)   be gender sensitive;&#13;
(b)   give children the opportunity to work on their own or in small groups;&#13;
(c)   conform to the core items of the National Policy for Education;&#13;
(d)   be free from caste and religious bias;&#13;
(e)   be suitable for use in multi-grade and/or multi-age environments;&#13;
(f)   offer options (for example, if the assignment is for a child to study a&#13;
flower, there should be a choice of flowers to study);&#13;
(g)   encourage children to write;&#13;
(h)   involve the family in the child's learning;&#13;
(i)   reflect the need to reduce the academic burden of children;&#13;
0)    contain appropriate material to enable children to achieve MLLs;&#13;
(k)   be affordable - either to the state if they are to be provided to children&#13;
free of charge, or to parents if they are to be sold;&#13;
(1)   should be locally specific. They should answer the needs of children&#13;
from both rural and urban backgrounds, from different terrains and&#13;
climates and from different socio-economic backgrounds;&#13;
(m)   contain material that will help teachers to use them effectively; and&#13;
(n)   be fluent and accurate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -                           Annex 11&#13;
34.          To satisfy all these requirements in a limited number of pages is virtually&#13;
impossible. States must consider what they will emphasize in their core textbooks and how&#13;
they will handle what they have to leave out.&#13;
35.          Supplementary materials as support. DPEP supports states, districts and&#13;
sub districts in the preparation of new teaching/learning materials and in the production of&#13;
sufficient copies to satisfy the needs of project districts. It also finances school libraries.&#13;
36.          Through the development of its own materials and the introduction of&#13;
materials from other sources, states can provide the additional inputs for teachers and&#13;
children that the core textbook has inevitably to leave. These supplementary materials should&#13;
not consist solely of readers, but also of activity books of all kinds. They should be readily&#13;
available in the classroom at all times.&#13;
37.          Through annual grants of Rs. 500 to teachers and of Rs. 2,000 to schools, it&#13;
will be possible to increase the number and variety of supplementary materials throughout&#13;
the project.&#13;
38.          States are aware that the process of replacing their existing teaching and&#13;
learning materials will take time. In the first year of the project their targets must not be over&#13;
ambitious. The following tasks are as much as can be undertaken in the time.&#13;
39           The key decision makers in teaching and learning material development must&#13;
first be identified. In the DPEP II states, the SCERT or its equivalent will handle the&#13;
development of textbook content. The institutions that will be responsible for transforming&#13;
this material into finished materials and distributing them throughout the state vary in each of&#13;
the new states.&#13;
40           The relationship between the various entities involved in the development and&#13;
publication of teaching/learning materials is crucial. Should the structure need to be changed&#13;
and new specialist staff employed in order to be more responsive to the state's needs and&#13;
more professional in meeting them, this should be planned in the first year of the project, but&#13;
not implemented until the second year at the earliest.&#13;
41.          State level technical support group associated to teaching and learning&#13;
materials. State Project Officers should appoint a Technical Support Group to offer advice&#13;
to the decision makers on all aspects of preparation, production, trialling, revision and&#13;
distribution of these materials.  It is particularly inmportant that it should not be&#13;
automatically assumed that curriculum developers and academics are the only individuals&#13;
who can fill the roles. They should be joined by practising primary teachers and by experts in&#13;
the various specialist tasks from authorship to distribution. Frank feedback should be sought&#13;
from headteachers, teachers, education officials and children on all aspects of the states'&#13;
existing teaching/learning materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-161 -                           Annex 11&#13;
42.          The TSG should work with the key decision makers to look at and evaluate all&#13;
materials from other states. They should pay particular attention to new materials produced&#13;
by DPEP I states to provide support for the introduction of MLLs. It would be valuable for&#13;
evaluation teams to see the evaluation reports that NCERT and RIE teams have prepared on a&#13;
number of new titles.&#13;
43           The state team should visit appropriate states to learn how they are handling&#13;
the replacement of their teaching/learning materials. As well as certain of the DPEP I states,&#13;
Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are also in the process of bringing about change.&#13;
44.         The state team should identify institutions and individuals throughout the state&#13;
and elsewhere in India on whose experience and expertise it could call during the renewal&#13;
process. Research should not be limited to goverment institutions, nor simply to institutions&#13;
in the field of education. For example, several NGOs have developed, trialled and introduced&#13;
teaching/learning which support child centred education. Also in the fields of health and&#13;
agriculture there may be talented writers, editors and illustrators.&#13;
45.          The Delhi-based institutions that are most likely to be supportive to the states&#13;
in their task of renewal are the national level Technical Support Group and NCERT.&#13;
However, pioneering work in child centered pedagogy has been carried out by NGOs on&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar.&#13;
46.          Publishing Resources  Himachal Pradesh has until now used NCERT's&#13;
textbook titles virtually without alteration. The SCERT in Solan is well below its authorized&#13;
pre-project establishment. Vacant posts must be filled before project implementation. The&#13;
state level project proposal includes provision for a new department of Curriculum, Textbook&#13;
and Reading Material Development. Until this is set up and staffed, progress on the&#13;
preparation of curriculum and new teaching/leaming materials cannot start. The posts&#13;
shouldbe filled within six months of project effectiveness.&#13;
47.         Production and distribution have been handled by the Board of School&#13;
Education in Dharamsala. It will be essential for the BSE to strengthen its resources to&#13;
handle the volume of work required. Existing staff will need training and additional staff&#13;
will almost certainly be required. At present the state project proposal makes no provision&#13;
for this. Proposals should be submitted to the DPEP bureau before negotiations.&#13;
48           Orissa's request for printing machinery and skilled production staff for its&#13;
Textbook Press have been disallowed under DPEP guidelines. The state also plans to&#13;
strengthen its SCERT but so far has not proposed training or additional staff for its Institute&#13;
of Textbook Production. Proposals should be submitted to the DPEP bureau in the first six&#13;
months of implementation&#13;
49.          In Gujurat teaching/learning materials are both developed and published by&#13;
the School Textbook Board in Gandhinagar, which is an autonomous organisation. The&#13;
state's project proposal includes no equipment, training or additional staff for the Textbook&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 162 -                         Annex 11&#13;
Board. Budgets for revision of textbooks are meagre. Further proposals should be submitted&#13;
to the DPEP bureau before negotiations.&#13;
ASSESSMENT&#13;
50.         DPEP II will benefit from the baseline assessment studies carried-out under&#13;
terms of reference and methodology approved by IDA for DPEP I and fully explained in&#13;
Annex 4 of the DPEP I SAR. The objectives of these studies are: (a) to assess the&#13;
achievement level of students who were nearing the end of primary cycle in the ditricts under&#13;
the DPEP program and to investigate differences in achievement of the different groups of&#13;
students (boys/girls, SC/ST students, and rural and urban students); (b) to estimate the level&#13;
of learning of simple skills of literacy and numeracy achieved at the end of class 1 and of&#13;
students who had dropped out after 3 or 4 years of schooling; and (c) to collect data on&#13;
relevant pupil background and school factors that could explain differences in the learning&#13;
achievement of pupils at the end of the primary cycle.&#13;
51.         Baseline assessment studies have been carried-out in the 12 districts of the&#13;
three new states and would be repeated in three years time after DPEP II has been declared&#13;
effective. DPEP guidelines establish that compliance with the completion of baseline&#13;
assessment studies in expansion districts is a condition of eligibility (para. 3.21 of the SAR).&#13;
SUPERVISION AND SUPPORT&#13;
52.         DPEP has flagged the issue of continuous support and supervision in the&#13;
schools simultaneously with training inputs as they flow in the schools.&#13;
53.         DPEP II will finance activities for on-site supervision and support in two&#13;
ways. CRC co-ordinators will have monthly meetings with teachers throughout the project&#13;
period starting from the middle of the first year. The supervisors of the school system will&#13;
receive training at the BRC to be in tune with DPEP inputs and reinforce the same during&#13;
their visits to and interaction with schools.&#13;
54.         The pedagogical interventions and training design following a cascade&#13;
approach will also necessitate continuous supervision and support at all levels of the cascade&#13;
(SCERT to support activities at the DIET; DIET at BRC; BRC at CRC; and finally, CRC at&#13;
the school).  DPEP would finance activities for this purpose by way of travel,&#13;
accommodations, material development, workshops and technical assistance.&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Distance Education&#13;
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.          DPEP Baseline studies conducted during the project's preparation phase&#13;
highlighted serious shortcomings among the primary teaching cadre posted to rural schools.&#13;
Although differences in levels of subject matter knowledge and pedagogical preparation were&#13;
found between the teachers of different states, all states were found to need a strong emphasis&#13;
on teacher training efforts to address existing gaps.&#13;
2.          In order to improve student achievement in rural primary schools, DPEP has&#13;
set out to address these gaps in teachers' knowledge of subject matter and their ability to&#13;
practice the skills associated with the multi-grade teaching and active learning. At present,&#13;
DPEP districts are focusing their training efforts on short term in-service training for up-&#13;
grading primary school teachers. This teacher up-grading provides all DPEP district primary&#13;
school teachers with a five day block of residential in-service training to improve their&#13;
subject matter knowledge and to teach skills in the new pedagogy promulgated by DPEP.&#13;
3.           The first goal of all DPEP teacher training is to help develop a new vision of&#13;
primary education and to share that vision through training teachers to master the knowledge&#13;
and skills needed to put that vision into action. During appraisal, DOE/GOI proposed that all&#13;
effective means of training teachers be utilized in order to provide the wide range of teacher&#13;
training activities needed to achieve this goal.&#13;
4.           States taking part in DPEP have mounted a number of excellent face-to-face&#13;
teacher training programs to up-grade teachers from the DPEP districts. Because of the&#13;
difficulties encountered by the states in providing all training in face-to-face settings the GOI&#13;
has decided to include a distance education program for teacher training in the plans for&#13;
DPEP II.&#13;
5.          This distance education component of DPEP will capitalize on the experience&#13;
of Indira Gandhi Open University (IGNOU) and the National Council of Educational&#13;
Research and Training (NCERT) in providing education at a distance. Under the leadership&#13;
of IGNOU, distance education expertise will be provided to all of the DPEP states in order to&#13;
help them address teacher training needs by providing access to distance education methods&#13;
and materials to assist their on-going teacher training programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -                          Annex 12&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY&#13;
6.          In its first phase the distance education component will provide assistance to&#13;
teacher training efforts in a limited number of states. These initial states will be selected from&#13;
the pool of the DPEP (I) states based on the readiness of their primary teacher training&#13;
programs. DPEP states who have made progress in mobilizing and training resource people&#13;
and in developing the necessary vision of the new pedagogy will be given priority for&#13;
distance education assistance to extend their programs. In the second year of the project the&#13;
remaining DPEP states that are ready to take part will be phased into the program. Among&#13;
the states included in the first phase of the program, top priority will be given to assisting&#13;
states in providing distance education to support efforts to upgrade all of the teachers in the&#13;
DPEP districts. A lesser priority will be given to assisting states to adapt and develop&#13;
distance learning materials for the purpose of providing more longer term distance education&#13;
for teachers who were posted to schools without the standard teacher training course.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
7.          The distance education component will be managed as an activity of the Indira&#13;
Gandhi University (IGNOU) in cooperation with the National Council of Educational&#13;
Research and Training (NCERT). It has been agreed that the program professional staff will&#13;
hold positions consistent with similar university responsibilities and will receive pay and&#13;
benefits according to the appropriate university schedule.&#13;
8.          The staff of the distance education program will be recruited and posted to the&#13;
component in a sequenced fashion in order to add staff only as responsibilities increase due&#13;
to the need to assist additional states as the program is extended to all DPEP states. A&#13;
significant proportion of the programs' workshops and training activities will be carried out&#13;
by contracted persons rather than by project staff. Procedures consistent with World Bank&#13;
rules for letting of such contracts will be worked out and followed.&#13;
PROPOSED INTERVENTION AND ACTION PLAN&#13;
9.          Launch program. The distance education program will begin activities with&#13;
a "launch workshop". This workshop will include:&#13;
*     directors of training from the relevant states;&#13;
*     experts in the DPEP pedagogy;&#13;
*     national experts in active learning and multi-grade teaching to provide&#13;
demonstrations;&#13;
*     resource persons from the region who represent successful teacher training&#13;
programs (Sri Lanka, Indonesia);&#13;
*     key personnel from national institutions who will be involved in the future&#13;
work of the DPEP; and&#13;
*     experts from international organizations to represent the focus of their&#13;
contribution to primary education in India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -                          Annex 12&#13;
10.         The purpose of this workshop is to communicate enthusiasm, share lessons&#13;
learned and to spread the pedagogical mission of DPEP among distance learning advocates.&#13;
11.         Produce state-level plans. Following the "launch workshop" efforts will&#13;
focus on activities to be carried out at state level. Planning workshops will be conducted at&#13;
each state level DPEP project office to involve all relevant people. Each of these workshops&#13;
will produce an agreed upon workplan for at least the first year of the distance education&#13;
program. It is expected that by October all of the DPEP states who plan to be active in the&#13;
distance education program will have completed their first year workplan and will be&#13;
involved in distance learning planning and production.&#13;
12.         Assist states to plan and produce distance education methods, processes&#13;
and materials.  Materials Planning and Development Workshops will be conducted&#13;
regularly at state level. These workshops will be led by experts contracted by the DPEP and&#13;
will address needs set forth earlier in the annual workplan created at the Annual State&#13;
Distance Education Workshop. At the end of each Materials Planning and Development&#13;
Workshop a number of finished plans for an educational materials (text, script, etc.) will be&#13;
ready to be trialed, reviewed, revised and scheduled for production.&#13;
13.         The distance education program will provide experts to provide hands-on&#13;
advice and training to help states with planning and carrying out the production of distance&#13;
education materials. If materials production is to be contracted the states will be helped in&#13;
the contracting process so as to assure the desire quality. Help will be provided in pre-testing&#13;
educational approaches and in trialing products before final production.&#13;
14.         Distance education component has included funds in its budget for each state&#13;
pay for the production of distance education material to include print materials and audio and&#13;
video programs. The funds budgeted for this purpose will be provided to the state DPEP&#13;
budget for the state to spend according to its Annual Distance Education Workplan. The&#13;
distance learning program will encourage and assist states in seeking a wide range of&#13;
producers with whom to contract for materials production.&#13;
15.         The component work will be focused on assisting the states to develop&#13;
distance education materials as part of their on-going teacher training programs in their own&#13;
regional languages or languages and suited to the various cultures that are found among the&#13;
DPEP districts.&#13;
16.         The output of the distance education program  of DPEP will consist of&#13;
assisting in developing/producing in each state:&#13;
*     approximately 50 modules of distance learning materials to include self-&#13;
instructional materials, activity assignments, case studies, media notes,&#13;
resource pack, etc.;&#13;
*     10 video cassettes, each of 20-30 minutes duration;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-166 -                           Annex 12&#13;
*     20 audio cassettes, each of 15-20 minutes duration;&#13;
*     25-30 persons possessing competencies required for developing distance&#13;
education print materials;&#13;
*     adequate competencies in all CRC coordinators, BRC coordinators, DIET&#13;
personnel and other resource person in providing support services to trainees,&#13;
as well as assessing their training achievement;&#13;
*     physical facilities in CRCs, BRCs, and DIETs required for implementing&#13;
distance education inputs and materials;&#13;
*     a suitable mechanism  for grading trainees when credit is desired for&#13;
certification purposes, involving agencies such as CRCs, BRCs, DIETs,&#13;
DPOs, SPOs, SCERT and Study Centers and Regional Centers of IGNOU;&#13;
*     an appropriate system for maintaining training related information linked to&#13;
the MIS; and&#13;
*     capacity among personnel in DIETs and SCERT in conducting/assisting&#13;
research and monitoring activities related to the impact of treating learning&#13;
processes.&#13;
17.         The distance education approadch is a means to provide continuous up-&#13;
grading for primary school teachers after they have received the five-day residence-based&#13;
DPEP teacher training. The distance education program will help the states to establish the&#13;
idea of continuous learning and to encourage the teachers to embrace the idea that&#13;
professional development is part of their responsibility as teachers.&#13;
18.         In cooperation with the NCERT, the prograrp will assist in the continuing&#13;
training of staff at DIETs. The existing television studio and satellite up-linking facility at&#13;
IGNOU will be used to disseminate training programs to DIET sites to strengthen their&#13;
primary school orientation and training.&#13;
19.         The component budget includes a modest sum for extending this effort by&#13;
providing funds to provide signal receivers for seventy-five additional DIETS.&#13;
20.         The distance education program does not plan to use satellite-delivered video&#13;
conferencing for the purpose of teacher training which will take place, according to the DPEP&#13;
state plans, at Block Resource Centers (BRCs) and Cluster Resource Centers (CRCs).&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE&#13;
21.         A first year workplan for the component has been prepared. The project&#13;
director will be appointed by May so that other recruiting and project start-up activities can&#13;
be begun.&#13;
&#13;

PERFORMANCE INDICATOR AND IMPLEMENTATION BENCHMARKS&#13;
22.         High priority will be given to the rapid deployment of staffing, facilities and&#13;
equipment requirements for the implementation of the new Distance Education component.&#13;
This rapid start-up will be necessary for the project to play an active role in the primary&#13;
school teacher training programs of DPEP states. It has been agreed that critical staffing of&#13;
the program staff will be completed before the end of May so that active planning and&#13;
preparation for critical program launch events scheduled during the summer months can be&#13;
implemented.&#13;
23.         A revised version of the Distance Education component, comprising the&#13;
recommendations of the appraisal mission, was provided to IDA by GOI prior to&#13;
negotiations. At negotiations, GOI provided assurances that it will establish and maintain a&#13;
Distance Education Unit with adequate staff and  resources  to  be  responsible  for&#13;
implementing the distance education program under the Project (paras. 2.43 and 5.1 (g)). It is&#13;
expected that by December 31, 1996, the distance education workplans for the states&#13;
participating in the distance education program start-up will have been completed and the&#13;
first distance education materials planning workshops will have taken place.&#13;
24.         It is expected that by December 31, 1997, the second group of DPEP states&#13;
will have completed their distance education work plans and taken part in their first distance&#13;
education materials planning workshop.&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
INDIA: DPEP II - Civil Works&#13;
General&#13;
1.    Construction Program. The project will finance the construction of new primary&#13;
schools, additional classrooms in existing schools, major repairs and rehabilitation of&#13;
existing schools, rooms for Cluster Resource Centers, rooms at ECCE centers, Block&#13;
Resource Centers, some residential schools, as well as construction of toilets, water supply&#13;
and electrification at primary schools.  In addition, some construction works will be&#13;
undertaken at the DIET, SCERT and SIEMT levels, such as hostels at teacher training&#13;
centers. In accordance with the DPEP Guidelines, civil works will be limited to 24 percent&#13;
of overall project costs. Civil works maintenance costs, and professional services fees&#13;
associated with the design and supervision activities on the civil works projects are inclusive&#13;
within the 24 percent ceiling.&#13;
2.    The tables on Pages 170 and 171 of this annex provide a tabulation of the number&#13;
and types of facilities that are planned for construction in the three new DPEP states of&#13;
Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, and Orissa. The tables also provide an estimate of the numbers&#13;
and types of facilities that will be undertaken in the expansion districts of the existing DPEP&#13;
states, based on profiles of the current DPEP construction programs underway in other&#13;
districts of those states.&#13;
3.    The tables on Pages 172 and 173 of this annex provide an overview of the civil&#13;
works management matrix for design, construction and supervision activities in the three&#13;
new project states. Management of civil works activities in the existing DPEP states will&#13;
follow the procedures already in place, as documented in the respective Staff Appraisal&#13;
Reports for DPEP I and the U.P. Basic Education Project (UPBEP).&#13;
Directions for the Project&#13;
4.    Use of Consultants for Design and Supervision. Experience from UPBEP and&#13;
DPEP I has indicated that in the preparation of the construction manuals and designs for the&#13;
classroom and BRC construction the states have continued to promote the "classic"&#13;
classroom approach commonly associated with Public Works Department (PWD)&#13;
construction. Designs for SIEMTs, Ashrams, and other unique facilities proposed under the&#13;
project tend to follow the same pattern. An analysis of these past practices reveal that a&#13;
change in attitude on the part of the educationalists was needed so that they view themselves&#13;
as involved owner, rather than a passive recipient of whatever the engineers provide them in&#13;
the way of facilities. Since PWD offices are generally not accustomed or organized to&#13;
provide this collaborative type of arrangement, this project will promote the hiring of a&#13;
design consultants at the state or district levels who would be responsible to the ministry in&#13;
the preparation of plans and specifications which complement and respond to the education&#13;
programs espoused by DPEP. The state and district education teams will work with the&#13;
consultant designers and other "stakeholders" in the process to help them understand the&#13;
needs and requirements of the program - whether it be a classroom earmarked for multi-&#13;
grade teaching, an SCERT renovation, or a Block Resource Center. Other "stakeholders"&#13;
might include the PWD, if they are eventually expected to construct the facility, or occupants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169-&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
of the facility itself, such as a teacher, or a SCERT official. Consultant agreements with&#13;
design professionals will also be planned at the SPO and TSG levels to strengthen quality&#13;
control and review roles inherent in those organizations with respect to the oversight of the&#13;
civil works programs at the state and district levels.&#13;
5.     A  second area identified  for strengthening in this project following on the&#13;
experiences of the earlier DPEP projects is in the arrangements for supervision of the works&#13;
under construction. Most plans call for inspection by PWD personnel or junior engineers at&#13;
local Panchyat levels. This is a reasonable procedure, especially if the PWD has been&#13;
charged with the responsibility to tender and award the construction by contract&#13;
arrangements. Nevertheless, experience on the previous DPEP projects has shown that&#13;
supervision by staff engineers alone is often too erratic to insure the necessary quality&#13;
control. To strengthen the quality control program where existing "organizational" structures&#13;
are weak or ineffective, states plan to contract for third party supervision by contract&#13;
arrangement with an architectural or engineering firm. Terms of reference for such contracts&#13;
would provide for site visits to active construction sites at a frequency of roughly three times&#13;
per month over a given period of time, say six months. Travel and per diem costs would be&#13;
included within the contract fees, and the supervision firm would be responsible for&#13;
providing site visit reports to the State/District project team. Such arrangements are not&#13;
meant to replace the PWD/Panchayat inspectors, but rather to supplement them. The&#13;
primary function is to alert the State/District project management team to construction&#13;
quality issues that need immediate attention.&#13;
6.     Classroom  Construction Innovation Fund.   While the construction programs&#13;
proposed by the states address the physical needs of the program in one sense (i.e., new&#13;
classrooms will be built), the evidence from UPBEP and DPEP I suggest that little is being&#13;
done to advance the "state of the art" in classroom  construction.  Given the present&#13;
classroom shortage, it is imperative to reduce the unit cost of the buildings. Throughout the&#13;
country there are many reputable agencies specializing in alternative building technologies&#13;
and cost effective construction techniques. Accordingly, to assist the states in tapping into&#13;
the pool of expertise that might be used in advancing the local "state of the art", a new&#13;
element being introduced to the project is the establishment of a Rs. 50 lakh Classroom&#13;
Construction Innovation Fund at each of the state level societies in Gujarat, Himachal&#13;
Pradesh and Orissa. The purpose of the fund will be to provide the resources for a state&#13;
effort directed toward the research, experimentation and evaluation of alternative, "low cost"&#13;
techniques for construction of classroom facilities.&#13;
7.     The Innovation Fund would be utilized in part for a design undertaking though a&#13;
collaborative effort involving consultant architects, regional polytechnics, educationalists,&#13;
and state construction agencies. The fund would also finance the actual construction of&#13;
prototype designs in communities covered by the DPEP II project. Initially, the construction&#13;
of these prototype classrooms would be a parallel activity to the ongoing construction of&#13;
more traditional designs during the early stages of the DPEP II implementation period.&#13;
However, once an evaluation has been made of successful, replicable techniques in the&#13;
prototype classrooms, it is expected that these alternative methods of construction would be&#13;
incorporated into the classroom construction program during the remaining project period.&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Economic and Financial Issues&#13;
1.          This annex has six sections. The first presents evidence from studies of the&#13;
economic and social outcomes of primary education in India in general and discusses some of&#13;
the projected outcomes of the project. The second summarises the results of recent economic&#13;
and sector work (ESW) on the determinants of learning achievement and the most cost effective&#13;
interventions. The four remaining sections concentrate on financial issues of the project. They&#13;
record the educational expenditures of IDA-supported DPEP I states since the beginning of that&#13;
project, describe expenditure patterns in the three new DPEP states, and consider the issues of&#13;
additionality and financial sustainability for the new and expansion states in DPEP II. The&#13;
results inform the final section which discusses the implications of the analysis for the appraisal&#13;
of expansion states and for project supervision.&#13;
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
2.          The economic impact of primary schooling in India has been measured several&#13;
times through rate of return studies. These have been very geographically limited and the most&#13;
recent comprehensive analysis used data for 1978. Adjusting the basic set of estimates for&#13;
wastage gave social rates of return of 13 and 15 percent for primary and upper primary&#13;
schooling respectively (Tilak 1987). Foster and Rosenzweig (1994a) recently analyzed data sets&#13;
over the period 1968 to 1982 to investigate the effects of education on the utilization of&#13;
technical change, and the outcomes, in agriculture. They concluded that for every one rupee&#13;
increase in profit due to the effects of exogenous technical change, those households with&#13;
primary schooling experienced an additional 1.38 rupees and that schooling appeared to have a&#13;
substantially more important effect in enhancing farmer productivity from high yielding&#13;
varieties of grain than did the extension services. A second analysis of the data sets concluded&#13;
that information externalities are important in the early stages of the adoption of new&#13;
technologies.  Farmers with no or little schooling benefitted from their more schooled&#13;
neighbors who were the first to adopt the new seeds.&#13;
3.          The level of schooling has influenced poverty reduction as well as economic&#13;
growth. Datt and Ravallion (1995) investigated the uneveness in changes in rural living&#13;
standards and levels of poverty across Indian states between 1957 and 1991. Living standards&#13;
were raised by higher agricultural yields, lower inflation and higher state spending on&#13;
development programs. Such factors, however, provided only a partial explanation of relative&#13;
success and failure between states. States with better infrastructure in general and higher levels&#13;
of literacy in particular at the beginning of the period had significantly higher long-term rates of&#13;
both consumption growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
4.          Finally, an aggregate production function study to assess the impact of primary&#13;
schooling on economic growth in India was commissioned as part of recent ESW. This was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -                           Annex 14&#13;
based on a simplified version of the Bank study of successful Southeast Asian economies but&#13;
used data for individual states. An attempt was made to disaggregate the sources of growth over&#13;
the period 1961 to 1981. For the first decade the results were largely insignificant. For the later&#13;
period the results indicated a substantial effect of education, and primary education in&#13;
particular, on economic growth.. Now that the approach has been introduced to Indian scholars,&#13;
it is hoped that the study will be updated and refined once the labor force data from the 1991&#13;
Census are published.&#13;
5.                  A second study commissioned for the ESW  attempted to estimate the&#13;
coverage, efficiency and effectiveness of school incentive programs in two states. Across the&#13;
country there are very many incentive programs, mainly for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe&#13;
children, and for poor girls. The most common programs are free textbooks and uniforms.&#13;
Some states provide writing materials, sandals and attendance allowances. Noon day meal&#13;
programs which were operated in some states (notably in Tamil Nadu and Orissa) have recently&#13;
been substituted by a comprehensive central government program. After teachers salaries, the&#13;
cost of incentive programs is the major component of the unit cost of primary education.&#13;
Previous evaluations of incentive programs have only focused on the impact of noon day meal&#13;
schemes on enrollment and retention. The results have not been conclusive. The study for the&#13;
ESW concentrated on Haryana and Maharashtra. In these two states, expenditure on incentives&#13;
was twice that on all other school inputs combined (apart from teacher salaries). Overall, the&#13;
results indicated that while the incentives are of great importance for the very poor, parents in&#13;
general are more influenced by the perceived utility and quality of schooling. While not&#13;
influencing the state governments' own expenditures on incentives, the DPEP Guidelines omit&#13;
these programs from the list of eligible items.&#13;
6.           Evidence of the social impact of primary schooling has been greatly&#13;
strengthened by the recent publication of the National Family Health Surveys for each major&#13;
state based on data collected during 1992-93. Data on fertility, child health and nutritional&#13;
status by mother's eduation for each of the three new DPEP II states is presented in Table 1.&#13;
7.           The total fertility rate and the ideal number of children differ significantly by&#13;
level of mother's education in each state. The impact of literacy and some elementary&#13;
education is particularly evident. Given that reductions in fertility reflect desired changes,&#13;
private benefits accrue both to the couples and their children in the sense that fewer children&#13;
tend to receive higher investments in schooling and parental time. Reduced fertility rates,&#13;
however, are also generally regarded as being economically beneficial to society as a whole in&#13;
countries such as India with high rates of population growth.&#13;
8.          A second area where schooling has been shown to have strong effects on&#13;
behavior in the Surveys is health, particularly child health. Within each of the states there is a&#13;
very clear pattern of lower infant (and child) mortality rates for mothers with increasingly&#13;
higher levels of education. In Gujarat in particular, infant mortality rates decrease very&#13;
substantially for children of those mothers with some elementary schooling. Child mortality&#13;
rates decrease by between a quarter and a third with this level of schooling. Mortality, and&#13;
morbidity, are likely to be influenced by the prevalence of immunization. The percentages of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -                         Annex 14&#13;
children below the age of 23 months who had received the full Extended Programme of&#13;
Immunization by level of their mother's schooling are shown in Table 1. Some elementary&#13;
schooling is strongly associated with an increase in the full set of vaccinations (and with the&#13;
reductions in the percentage of children with no vaccinations). Reductions in infant and child&#13;
mortality and morbidity reduce suffering and increase the physical strength of surviving&#13;
children. They also reduce the time that women are removed from the labor market for&#13;
compensatory additional childbirth and treating child illness. In turn this increases female labor&#13;
force participation. Decreases in infectious diseases through innoculation also result in social&#13;
benefits.&#13;

9.           Mother's schooling also influences children's nutritional status. The Surveys&#13;
recorded levels of severely undernourished children by mother's educational level. Reductions&#13;
are quite strongly related to literacy and some elementary schooling. There is substantial cross-&#13;
country evidence that healthy and well-nourished children utilize educational inputs more&#13;
effectively.&#13;
10.          The data presented above for the new project states of Gujarat, Himachal&#13;
Pradesh and Orissa demonstrate the very strong relationships between the level of schooling,&#13;
and of mothers in particular, and the levels of fertility, child health and nutritional status of&#13;
families. Comparisons across other Indian states which are at very different stages of primary&#13;
school development suggest a second type of impact. For each level of education, the effects&#13;
on the individual appear to be greater the broader is the coverage of that level of education&#13;
across the community. This conclusion parallels the studies of the impact of schooling on&#13;
agricultural innovation which demonstrated the external benefits resulting from a sufficiently&#13;
large body of literate farmers. DPEP districts are, by definition, educationally backward. The&#13;
relationships described above suggest that significant returns can be expected from the&#13;
universalization of schooling in general and the proposed project in particular.&#13;
11.         In addition to an increase in access to primary schooling, the project aims to&#13;
substantially increase quality. One consequence would be an increased level of internal&#13;
efficiency in the system. Across India, both dropout and repetition rates are high. Roughly, a&#13;
provision of a total of 8.5 years of schooling is required to produce one graduate of the five year&#13;
primary school cycle. Alternatively expressed, up to 70 percent more resources are being used&#13;
than would be necessary in a situation of no dropout or repetition. On the assumption that&#13;
increases in the quality of inputs will reduce repetition and dropout levels by half, a total of 6.3&#13;
years would be required - around 25 percent above those in a perfectly operating system. Rough&#13;
estimations suggest that the quality-enhancing interventions associated with DPEP will add&#13;
around one sixth to the unit cost of primary schooling. If these halve the repetition and dropout&#13;
rates, they would reduce costs per graduate by one quarter. This is in addition to the benefits&#13;
directly derived from increases in learning achievement.&#13;
INTERVENTIONS FOR INCREASED LEARNING ACHIEVEMENT&#13;
12.          Over the past two years, analyses of the determinants of learning in primary&#13;
schools and the costs of specific interventions have been undertaken based on extensive survey&#13;
work in 39 low literacy districts in eight states. Pupil achievement surveys include data&#13;
collection on pupil, family, community and school characteristics. Costs of potential&#13;
interventions are being taken from the results of detailed field studies of the unit cost of primary&#13;
schooling in two states, as well as from the surveys. This major program of action research into&#13;
learning achievements and its determinants is being undertaken by each district and state&#13;
applying for inclusion in the DPEP. The current analytical work is using data collected in 1993.&#13;
Capacity to utilize the analytical framework (HLM analysis) has been developed through&#13;
technical assistance. Members of the DPEP Bureau and the Technical Support Group have&#13;
been integrally involved in the design and the analytical framework developed for the baseline&#13;
achievement studies and India's major educational research and training institution (NCERT)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -                         Annex 14&#13;
has been the nodal agency. These members are also actively involved in introducing the new&#13;
DPEP states to the process of plan formulation and in monitoring the activities of the DPEP I&#13;
states. This ambitious program to measure and analyze the levels and determinants of learning&#13;
achievement is an inbuilt feature of the DPEP and is meant to continuously feed into the&#13;
national debate on school effectiveness and the district proposals and annual work programs.&#13;
13.         The second stage in the process will be to apply costs to those factors which&#13;
influence learning and are susceptible to policy intervention. This is being undertaken, currently&#13;
within the Bank, largely for illustrative purposes. Dissemination of the results of ESW later in&#13;
1996 will include discussions with the DPEP Bureau and relevant Indian institutions regarding&#13;
ways of furthering this analysis.&#13;
14.         Preliminary results suggest that learning is influenced most effectively by:&#13;
(a)   the level of floorspace per child;&#13;
(b)   the opportunity to learn as exemplified by total instructional time,&#13;
teacher attendance and coverage of the mathematics and language&#13;
lessons in the textbook;&#13;
(c)   teachers's subject knowledge;&#13;
(d)   length of teachers' pre-service education;&#13;
(e)   amount of instructional materials;&#13;
(f)   emphasis on active learning and teacher feedback;&#13;
(g)   a concerned academic climate; and&#13;
(h)   an emphasis on standards.&#13;
15.         Overall, however, the analysis so far suggests that the factors influencing&#13;
learning achievement vary considerably across states and even districts within states. This&#13;
reinforces the desirability for the programs to expand and improve primary education to focus&#13;
on districts and to require extensive participation in the production of plans. The process of&#13;
comprehensively measuring the outcomes of the interventions included in the DPEP has taken&#13;
root. The results will inform all further preparations of districts for the Program and the&#13;
monitoring of the annual work programs of those districts and states already funded.&#13;
DPEP I STATES - FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ADDITIONALITY&#13;
16.         The DPEP Guidelines include three financial conditions to which states entering&#13;
the Program must agree: (a) states will contribute 15 percent of total project cost; (b) program&#13;
resources are a net addition and states need to at least maintain the 1995-96 expenditure level&#13;
on elementary education in real terms, excluding funds earmarked for the DPEP; and (c) annual&#13;
recurrent costs of the project are shown to be sustainable on state non-plan budgets at the end of&#13;
the project.&#13;
17.         The DPEP  became effective in  Assam, Haryana, Kamataka, Kerala,&#13;
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh in early 1995. The early experiences of states&#13;
providing their required share of 15 percent can be judged from Table 2.&#13;

Note: Rs. 42.4 lakhs are to be released by Government of Assam shortly.&#13;
18.         The first year experience for this condition appears encouraging. The slight&#13;
shortfalls in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, and the more substantial one in Assam,&#13;
however, indicate that strict monitoring will continue to be required. State government&#13;
contributions for 1995/96 will be transfered to societies at the end of the financial year.&#13;
19.         The second condition requires the maintenance of real expenditures on&#13;
elementary education. Table 3 describes expenditures in the base year 1991/92 and in 1994/95&#13;
(revised estimates) and 1995/96 (budget estimates) at current prices. The last two columns&#13;
show the real increase in expenditures between 1994/95 and 1995/96 and the base year in&#13;
percentage terms.&#13;
20.         There are large variations in performance between states. Madhya Pradesh,&#13;
Kamnataka and Kerala have increased real expenditures considerably. In Assarn, Haryana and&#13;
Maharashtra the increases, while lower, have been positive - though in the latter two states&#13;
budgeted expenditures for 1995/96 imply a reduction in real terms over the previous year. In&#13;
Tamil Nadu, real expenditures in 1994/95 were just maintained at their 1991/92 level and for&#13;
1995/96 they are budgeted to be lower than in the base year - a situation which would be in&#13;
breach of the Guidelines.&#13;
21.         Expenditures on DPEP are included in the Plan budget. Plan expenditures on&#13;
elementary education are described in Table 4 for 1991/92, 1994/95 and 1995/96 in current and&#13;
constant 1991/92 prices.&#13;

22.         In 1994/95 real additional plan expenditures on elementary education were&#13;
lower than 1991/92 levels in Tamil Nadu. Budget estimates suggest they will also be lower in&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-181 -                          Annex 14&#13;
1995/96. In Kerala, real expenditure in addition to the state's contribution to DPEP was just&#13;
maintained. It is not clear that expenditures in Haryana in 1995/96 will increase in real terms&#13;
over the previous year once DPEP contributions are excluded. They will, however, remain&#13;
above the 1991/92 level. The same is true for Madhya Pradesh. Overall, all states apart from&#13;
Tamil Nadu are maintaining the real level of both total and plan expenditures on elementary&#13;
education. While Tamil Nadu just maintained total real expenditures in 1994/95 at the 1991/92&#13;
level, they are budgetted to be lower in 1995/96. Real plan expenditures were lower in 1994/95&#13;
than in 1991/92.&#13;
EDUCATION EXPENDITURES IN NEW DPEP STATES&#13;
23.         Trends in public finances, and in expenditures on education in general and on&#13;
elementary education in particular for the states supported by IDA credit in DPEP I are&#13;
described in detail in Annex 5 of the SAR for that project. A detailed description of&#13;
expenditures in the three new DPEP states to be funded by the project is provided in the project&#13;
files. Here a brief summary is presented of those aspects directly relevant to the DPEP&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
24.         Total education expenditure as a share of total government expenditure and state&#13;
domestic product from 1991/92 to 1994/95 for the three new states is described in Table 5. In&#13;
general, the share of total expenditure has increased slightly in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh&#13;
and decreased slightly in Orissa. As a share of SDP, expenditures are highest in Himachal&#13;
Pradesh.&#13;

Orissa                               5.4&#13;
26.         Most educational expenditures are on the revenue account. Between 1990/91&#13;
and 1993/94, capital expenditures were on average just 0.5, 2.0 and 1.8 percent of the total in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 182 -                         Annex 14&#13;
Gujarat, Himachal and Orissa, respectively. School buildings programs have been negligible in&#13;
recent years.&#13;
27.         The share of total educational expenditure allocated to elementary education is&#13;
similar in each state - 55/56 percent. Over the past few years the most noticeable shift in&#13;
educational expenditures has been away from the higher/tertiary level towards secondary, and&#13;
in Gujarat, towards elementary. The share of elementary expenditures in total government&#13;
expenditures has increased in Gujarat and Himachal and fallen in Orissa since 1990/91. It is&#13;
currently between 11 and 12 percent in each state. This is higher than the all-state average.&#13;
28.         The unit cost of elementary education varies between the three states. In each,&#13;
however, it is higher than the national average. Rough estimates for 1992/93 are: Himachal&#13;
Pradesh, Rs. 1165; Orissa, Rs. 823; Gujarat, Rs. 771; and, the all-state average, Rs. 751. These&#13;
reflect higher than average pupil:teacher ratios, particularly in Himachal Pradesh and Orissa.&#13;
29.         In Table 6, plan and non plan expenditures on elementary education for each of&#13;
the three states from 1988/89 to 1995/96 are presented.&#13;

30.         Between 1991/92 and 1994/95 non plan expenditures on elementary education&#13;
increased in Orissa by 54 percent and plan expenditures by 114 percent. In Gujarat, the&#13;
increases were 58 percent and -15 percent, respectively. In Himachal Pradesh the increases&#13;
were 61 and 86 percen,t respectively. Over this period prices rose by 27 percent. In each state,&#13;
real expenditures have increased. In Orissa and Himachal Pradesh, real plan expenditures have&#13;
increased while in Gujarat they have fallen.&#13;

31.         For the next stage of DPEP, the GOI has agreed to alter the base year against&#13;
which state's annual funding of elementary education is compared, from 1991/92 to 1995/96.&#13;
PROJECT FINANCING, ADDITIONALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY.&#13;
NEW STATES (GUJARAT, HIMACHAL PRADESH, AND ORISSA)&#13;
32.         State finances. The composition of government revenues differs significantly&#13;
between the three states. Table 7 presents the percentage composition by source for 1994/95.&#13;
Across all Indian states, transfers average around 40 percent In Gujarat they are well below the&#13;
average at 22 percent. In Orissa and Himachal Pradesh they are well over at 60 and 79 percent,&#13;
respectively. In Himachal Pradesh, grants alone contribute 57 percent of total revenues.&#13;

33.         Across all major states combined there has been a deficit on the revenue account&#13;
each year since 1987/88. In Table 8, revenue account surpluses/deficits for each of the three&#13;
states are provided for 1992/93 (actual), 1993/94 (revised estimates) and 1994/95 (budget&#13;
estimates). They are also shown as a share of total receipts. Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh&#13;
have had deficits in two of the three years and Orissa in all three. Across all (25) states the&#13;
deficits have been equal to around 6 percent of revenues in each year. In Gujarat, deficits have&#13;
been below this average, in Orissa they have averaged over 7 percent, while in Himachal&#13;
Pradesh they were significantly higher than average in two of the years.&#13;
34.         The gross fiscal deficit includes the balance on the revenue account plus capital&#13;
expenditures and net lending, i.e., the borrowing requirement. Each state in India has had a&#13;
gross fiscal deficit in each of the past three years. As a percentage of receipts these were&#13;
estimated for 1994/95 at 16.7 percent in Gujarat, 51.0 percent in Himachal Pradesh and 32.2&#13;
percent in Orissa. These compare to an average across all states of 25.2 percent.&#13;
35.         Another way of expressing the borrowing requirement is as a share of state&#13;
domestic product. Rough estimates are described in Table 9 for the three states for 1990/91 and&#13;
1994/95. While across 11 major states the share has remained constant at just over 4 percent, in&#13;
Gujarat it has fallen significantly from above the average to below. In Orissa the share has&#13;
increased and is among the highest. In Himachal Pradesh, it is particularly high and has&#13;
increased significantly in recent years.&#13;

36.          Finally, the states' debt and interest burdens are described in Table 10. The&#13;
former is again expressed as a share of state domestic product and the latter as a share of&#13;
revenues. Again the indicators are healthiest for Gujarat. The debt measure is below the all-&#13;
state average and has fallen slightly since 1990/91 while the interest burden has remained&#13;
relatively constant and below average. In both Orissa and Himachal Pradesh the debt burden is&#13;
twice that of Gujarat and almost twice the all state-average. Interest payments are rising in both&#13;
states and are equal to almost 20 percent of revenues in Orissa.&#13;
37.          Summarising, state government finances are strongest in Gujarat and have&#13;
improved over recent years. A very large proportion of state revenues are self generated, the&#13;
deficit on the revenue account has been reversed and annual borrowing (and the overall debt&#13;
stock) has been falling as a share of state domestic product. In Himachal Pradesh the&#13;
dependence on transfers, in particular grants, is very high. While the revenue account was in&#13;
surplus in 1993/94, it was estimated to be in a significant deficit in the following year. The&#13;
fiscal deficit as a proportion of total revenues is twice the national average. In Orissa, the&#13;
revenue and gross fiscal deficits as proportions of revenues are slightly above the all-states&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 185 -                          Annex 14&#13;
average. As a share of domestic product the fiscal deficit has been rising and is now well above&#13;
average. While interest payments as a share of revenues are just slightly above the national&#13;
average in both Orissa and Himachal Pradesh states and have been increasing at around the&#13;
average rate, the debt stocks in both states are particularly large suggesting higher levels of&#13;
payments in the coming years.&#13;

contribute 15 percent of total project cost, that all funding be additional to at least the&#13;
maintenance of real expenditures and that recurring expenditures of the project be sustained by&#13;
the state following completion of the project.&#13;
39.          Department of Education expenditures on elementary education over the past&#13;
five years in the three new states, expressed in Rs. crores, have been:&#13;
1991/92   1992/93   1993/94   1994/95  1995/96&#13;
Gujarat            541.8     561.9      690.6   845.3   961.7&#13;
Himachal Pradesh   101.3      125.2     134.3   162.5   183.4&#13;
Orissa             313.2     354.6      408.1   506.9   526.3&#13;
40.          Data to 1993/94 are actual expenditure, for 1994/95 are revised budget estimates&#13;
and for 1995/96 are the initial budget estimates. The anticipated total cost of the project is Rs.&#13;
99 crores for Gujarat, Rs. 147 crores for Himachal Pradesh and Rs. 148 crores for Orissa. The&#13;
average annual contribution would be Rs. 2.5 crores, Rs. 3.7 crores and Rs. 3.7 crores for each&#13;
of the three states, respectively.   These totals are equal to under 0.3 percent of actual&#13;
expenditure in 1993/94 in Gujarat, 0.7 percent in Orissa and to 2.3 percent in Himachal&#13;
Pradesh. As a proportion of plan expenditure on elementary education they are of course&#13;
higher. However, even in Himachal Pradesh they are equal to only one eighth of plan&#13;
expenditures. The required contributions should provide no problems for the state governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 186 -                           Annex 14&#13;
41.          In DPEP I, the base year for judging whether states are abiding by the&#13;
requirement of project additionality is 1991/92. For DPEP II, the Ministry has changed the&#13;
base year to 1995/96. States are required to at least maintain the real level of expenditures on&#13;
elementary education at the 1995/96 level - in addition to that required for project funding. The&#13;
real annual rate of growth of expenditure on elementary education between 1991/92 and&#13;
1994/95 was 9, 10 and 11 percent in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa, respectively.&#13;
Again then, in principle, the condition to at least maintain real expenditures should pose little&#13;
problem for the three states providing past growth is maintained, salaries are contained, and&#13;
overall growth of government revenues is buoyant. The experience of Tamil Nadu (refered to in&#13;
the previous section), and the relatively high proportion of plan funds which the state&#13;
contribution will require in Himachal Pradesh, however, suggest that close monitoring will be&#13;
required.&#13;
42.          The annual recurring costs in the year following completion of the project are&#13;
estimated provisionally to be Rs. 8.5 crores, Rs. 12 crores and Rs. 12 crores for Gujarat,&#13;
Himachal Pradesh and Orissa, respectively. Assuming a continuation of past rates of growth in&#13;
non plan expenditures to the end of the project, the elementary education budgets would be Rs.&#13;
1649 crores, Rs. 281 crores and Rs. 965, respectively. The additional recurrent costs would be&#13;
equal to 0.5, 4.3 and 1.2 percent of these. Taking an alternative approach, the additions to the&#13;
budget in that year for Gujarat. Himachal Pradesh and Orissa would be Rs. 148, Rs. 28 and Rs.&#13;
106 crores. respectively. On these assumptions, the additional costs would be comfortably&#13;
covered in each state, again, providing that the conditions in the previous paragraph are met.&#13;
43.          In this phase of the DPEP, only a few districts in each of the new states will be&#13;
covered - 3 out of 19 in Gujarat, 4 out of 12 in Himachal Pradesh and 5 out of 13 (very recently&#13;
increased to 30) in Orissa. Under the female literacy criterion, no other districts are eligible in&#13;
Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. Another 4 would be eligible in Orissa. The eligibility criterion,&#13;
however, reflects only one stage towards the aim of universal, higher quality schooling.&#13;
Sustainability, therefore. can be examined in the wider context. Assuming that programs were&#13;
implemented in all districts at the same cost as in the current project and over the same time&#13;
period, the incremental recurrent costs at the end of the period would be roughly Rs. 53, Rs. 36&#13;
and Rs. 31 crores in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa, respectively. Assuming a&#13;
continuation of the historic growth rate of elementary education expenditures, both Gujarat and&#13;
Orissa appear capable of supporting substantial efforts to universalize schooling. If real growth&#13;
fell to below 5 percent a year, however, Orissa would find this problematic. In both scenarios,&#13;
Himachal Pradesh would not be able to support the recurring costs and would require&#13;
substantial increases in state revenues, changes in expenditures and/or additional assistance.&#13;
44.          The above discussion assumes the continuation of past trends. At issue,&#13;
however, is the extent to which the performace of overall public finances will allow such a&#13;
continuation. In the first part of this section, the situation in Gujarat was seen to be healthier&#13;
than in most other states and continuing to improve. In Himachal Pradesh the fiscal deficit and&#13;
the debt stock are very high, despite very high levels of grants. In Orissa, deficits and debt&#13;
again are high. In both states interest payments as a share of revenues are increasing and the&#13;
large debt stocks suggests that this trend could accelerate. Current revenue and expenditure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 187 -                         Annex 14&#13;
trends in these states appear unsustainable. The current Orissa State Finance Study should&#13;
provide a more detailed picture and recommendations for improvement.&#13;
PROJECT FINANCING, ADDITIONALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY.&#13;
EXISTING DPEP I STATES.&#13;
45.         During preparation of DPEP I in 1994, the issues of project additionality and&#13;
sustainability were addressed for the six IDA-financed DPEP I states. The required (15 percent)&#13;
contribution to the project by states was equivalent to between 2 and 17 percent of their&#13;
1993/94 plan expenditure on primary schooling apart from in Kerala where it was much higher&#13;
(though in terms of absolute expenditures, quite low). The likelihood of the additionality&#13;
principle being followed was assessed by reviewing real levels of plan expenditures between&#13;
1990/91 and 1992/93. In each case, apart from in Tamil Nadu, real expenditures on elementary&#13;
education had increased each year. One qualification was noted. In Assam, the relatively high&#13;
and increasing levels of plan expenditure did not reflect additional new programs but rather the&#13;
necessity for ongoing programs to be funded through plan expenditure as a result of severe&#13;
constraints on the non plan budget. Project sustainability was assessed by comparing the&#13;
anticipated recurring costs of the project in the year following its completion with the expected&#13;
additions to non plan expenditure in that year. It was concluded that each state, apart from&#13;
Assam and Haryana, would be able to meet the incremental recurrent expenditures relatively&#13;
easily on the basis of conservative estimates of education expenditure growth. Assam would be&#13;
able to meet the requirement, though not easily. In Haryana, it was concluded that the&#13;
incremental costs could not be absorbed by the 'normal' addition to the education budget, based&#13;
on past trends. That state, however, has the third highest per capita income across all states and&#13;
relatively healthy public finances. Required expenditures as a share of total government&#13;
expenditure were estimated to be small. It was consequently argued that project sustainability&#13;
was potentially within the capability of the state.&#13;
46.          GOI has proposed that additional districts in each of the DPEP I states,&#13;
supported by the IDA credit, be supported in DPEP II. The 1994 analysis suggests that the&#13;
conditions of state contributions and additionality could be met without great difficulty in&#13;
Maharashtra, Haryana and Kamataka. There are severe constraints on plan financing in general&#13;
in Kerala but the low base could ease the fulfillment of the additionality condition. There would&#13;
need to be careful monitoring in Assam. The state has not yet provided its full DPEP I&#13;
contribution for 1994/95. On recent evidence the case of Tamil Nadu is most worrying.&#13;
During the short life of DPEP I, the state does not appear to have fulfilled at least part of the&#13;
additionality condition. Real plan expenditures on elementary education (including those&#13;
allocated for DPEP) in 1994/95 and those planned for 1995/96 are below 1991/92 levels. In&#13;
addition, while real non plan expenditures were just maintained in 1994/95, the budget&#13;
estimates for 1995/96 imply a reduction over 1991/92 levels..&#13;
47.         The precise number of districts in each state which will be proposed for DPEP II&#13;
is not yet finalised. A doubling is tentatively proposed.for existing DPEP I states. This would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 188 -                           Annex 14&#13;
obviously increase the pressures on sustaining incremental recurring expenditures at the end of&#13;
the project. The earlier analysis suggested that in each state apart from Haryana and Assam, the&#13;
incremental costs arising from a doubling of districts might just be covered by the 'normal'&#13;
departmental increment (though leaving few additional resources for non-project districts). In&#13;
both Assam and Haryana, the earlier analysis suggests that expansion would require resources&#13;
beyond those which past trends indicate would be made available by the state. In both cases,&#13;
this would necessitate intensified efforts for increasing revenues and altering patterns of&#13;
expenditure, and in Assam would also likely require additional central government assistance.&#13;
If Tamil Nadu was to seek additional funding, the DPEP Bureau would need to investigate the&#13;
causes of the planned reductions in expenditure.&#13;
48.          Two states outside of the IDA-supported DPEP I states have also been proposed.&#13;
These are Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. In the first of these, primary education is&#13;
currently being supported in ten districts (out of a total 66 districts) under a separate IDA credit.&#13;
In Madhya Pradesh, 19 districts (out of a total 45 districts) are being supported through a&#13;
European Community grant. The number of additional districts to be proposed in each state is&#13;
not known at this time (though it is likely to be between 10 and 15). Hence only very broad&#13;
generalizations can be made concerning the likelihood of these states being able to abide by the&#13;
additionality condition and to ultimately sustain the project.&#13;
49.          In Uttar Pradesh the gross fiscal deficit has remained equal to 5.6 percent of state&#13;
domestic product through the first half of the 1 990s. This is above the average across 11 major&#13;
states (4.3 percent) and is currently the fourth highest. State governrment debt as a share of&#13;
domestic product has risen from 26 to 32 percent and is the fourth highest across states.&#13;
Interest payments as a share of total revenues are the highest of all major states - 24 percent. In&#13;
all, Uttar Pradesh appears to be within the weakest group of states in terms of public finaces.&#13;
Together with Bihar and Punjab, the state shares the experience of having reduced both&#13;
recurrent spending on the social services and capital expenditures on power and irrigation as&#13;
shares of domestic income since 1990/91. State plan expenditures on elementary education&#13;
over the past five years in current prices were Rs. 86, Rs. 53, Rs. 70, Rs. 205 and Rs. 219&#13;
crores, respectively. Though the earlier years are not encouraging, it is apparent from the most&#13;
recent two years that large increases are possible. Non plan expenditures increased from Rs.&#13;
980 crores to Rs. 1468 crores over the five years - more than keeping pace with inflation.&#13;
However, it is highly likely that any significant increase in the number of districts being funded&#13;
could not be sustained by the 'normal' growth of state expenditures and would require both&#13;
additional revenues and changes in the pattern of expenditures.&#13;
50           Nineteen districts in Madhya Pradesh currently are being funded in the DPEP.&#13;
The appraisal report of the European Commission estimated incremental recurrent costs at the&#13;
end of the project as Rs. 65 crores. In 1993/94 non plan expenditures on elementary education&#13;
were Rs. 698 crores. The real growth rate of expenditures would need to be over 9 percent a&#13;
year over the life of the project to sustain the existing expansion. Again, any further expansion&#13;
of project districts is likely to require changes in the sources of revenues and pattern of&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 189 -                         Annex 14&#13;
IMPLICATIONS&#13;
51.         For a number of reasons, the DPEP I states supported by IDA did not include&#13;
any of the economically or educationally most backward states. Further, the largest number of&#13;
districts supported in a single state was five. For these states, the additionality condition to&#13;
simply maintain the level of expenditures was not onerous and sustainability of the project was&#13;
seen to be well within each states' ability - providing Haryana showed the required political&#13;
will and Assam continued to be centrally supported.&#13;
52.         Among the new states in DPEP II one, Orissa, does fall into the more&#13;
economically and educationally backward states. Public finances are weak. However, the&#13;
requirement to strengthen public finances results from overall unsustainable trends in revenue&#13;
and expenditure growth, not from the patterns and requirements simply of the education sector.&#13;
The need to provide the necessary recurring costs at the end of the project is one more reason&#13;
for structural change in the state's finances. The districts proposed form a minority of the total.&#13;
This level of investment should be sustainable by the state within a reformed structure of public&#13;
finances. Of the three new states, the largest burden resulting from the project is for Himachal&#13;
Pradesh. Project expenditures and the incremental costs are much higher as a share of existing&#13;
expendure in this state than in the others. The state is very dependent on grants from the central&#13;
government. Even more than in the other states, the annual work plans will need to be carefully&#13;
monitored to ensure that the adopted norms are not totally out of line with those of other states.&#13;
53.         The proposed expansion of districts in the existing DPEP I states again should&#13;
not cause particular problems in terms of the additionality conditions of the DPEP Guidelines.&#13;
The number of districts falling within the criteria is small in each case. The qualifications noted&#13;
above for DPEP I for Haryana, and particularly for Assam, are strengthened, but again the&#13;
conditions should be within the reach of the state governments. The situation in Tamil Nadu&#13;
causes most concern. The real level of plan expenditures has not been maintained and while&#13;
non plan expenditures in 1994/95 were just equal to the 1991/92 level, the budget estimates for&#13;
1995/96 imply a reduction. If this occurs, the condition of the DPEP Guidelines will not be&#13;
met. In terms of sustainability, both Assam and Haryana would need to provide resources&#13;
beyond those which post trends indicate would be made available. In both cases, this would&#13;
necessitate intensified efforts for increasing revenues and altering patterns of expenditure.&#13;
54.         More problems arise with the inclusion of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.&#13;
Both are educationally backward and have many districts which would qualify for inclusion in&#13;
the project. Both are among the group of poorest states. If a significant number of additional&#13;
districts are to come within the DPEP it is less likely that these two states will be able to&#13;
maintain real expenditures (particularly plan expenditures) in addition to their required&#13;
contributions for the new states. It is even more unlikely that they would be able to sustain the&#13;
recurring expenditures at the end of the project. To continue the process towards universal&#13;
schooling in these states would require additional programs in the future. At this time, it has to&#13;

would require substantial changes to the level and patterns of revenues and expenditures.&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Social Assessment and Participation&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.           Historically education has been recognized as the key to development. India,&#13;
in its plan to provide universal education by the year 2000, has demonstrated a clear&#13;
understanding of this principle. The District Primary Education Program (DPEP) has been&#13;
designed to help districts develop a comprehensive plan to meet the education needs of&#13;
children between 6 and 11 years old. DPEP, in setting criteria that selected districts have a&#13;
female literacy of less than 39.2 percent, places special emphasis on those groups who have&#13;
traditionally been isolated from the educational system: the scheduled tribes (ST), scheduled&#13;
castes (SC) and girls. The 42 districts included in phase one of the DPEP program have&#13;
provided experience which will be of valuable assistance in meeting the challenges of the&#13;
additional 60 to 70 districts in DPEP 11 (12 in the three new states, and between 50 to 60 in&#13;
the seven DPEP I states and Uttar Pradesh). Although geographic or demographic data&#13;
differ, the issues faced by the SC/ST and female population of the DPEP II districts do not&#13;
significantly differ from those recorded in DPEP 1.&#13;
2.           This Annex describes the relevant issues faced by girls, SC and ST primary&#13;
education students concerning their access and retention in the primary school system and the&#13;
quality of education they receive. Based on the lessons learned during the implementation of&#13;
DPEP I, the Annex proposes a strategy to address these issues.&#13;
GENDER ISSUES&#13;
3.           Access. As can be seen from the table describing the district profiles in the&#13;
three new states in Annex 9, female enrollment rates are significantly below 50 percent: 6&#13;
districts register lower than 45 percent female enrollment. Social, cultural and economic&#13;
conditions contribute to these low enrollment figures. Parents, many of whom are illiterate&#13;
themselves, do not see the importance of an education for girls; in fact, it has negative&#13;
economic and social consequences.&#13;
An educated girl encounters a more difficult time in finding a suitable&#13;
marriage partner;&#13;
Education is perceived as leading to an erosion of traditional values;&#13;
Limited family resources are reserved for the educational needs of boys as&#13;
they are seen as a source of support and income for old age;&#13;
School is perceived to add a financial burden: books, clothes, school fees, etc.,&#13;
making it a hardship for poor families to send their children to school.&#13;
Girls are required to assist in domestic and agricultural chores and to provide&#13;
sibling care;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 192-                              Annex 15&#13;
*     School timings interfere with the work schedule of girls;&#13;
*     Parents are concerned for the security of girls who must walk to remotely&#13;
located schools;&#13;
*     The lack of female teachers is a motivational and security issue;&#13;
*     Daughters of migrant laborers often settle in locations without schools; and&#13;
*      Schools are not available in all villages.&#13;
4.            Retention. This same table shows that the average dropout rate of girls, 49&#13;
percent, is considerably higher than that of 39 percent for boys. Although much of this can&#13;
be attributed to the low priority given to girls education, other factors must be considered.&#13;
*     Schools are poorly maintained;&#13;
*     Drinking water and toilet facilities are not available;&#13;
*     Teachers are often absent or not motivated;&#13;
*     Many students are afraid of teachers who are known to punish;&#13;
*     Girls, once reaching puberty are kept at home;&#13;
*     Girls marry at an early age and drop out;&#13;
*^    Inflexible school calendar timings affects migrant laborers and those faced&#13;
with seasonal responsibilities, such as harvesting. Increased absenteeism&#13;
during these periods ultimately leads to a desire to drop out; and&#13;
*     Peer pressure by other dropouts encourages similar behavior.&#13;
5.            Quality. The average female literacy rate in the 12 districts is 26 percent&#13;
while males achieve 51, a difference of 25 points. Poor achievement can be attributed to the&#13;
quality of the curriculum and the skill of the teacher.&#13;
*     The curriculum, which does not include references to traditional female&#13;
activities , e.g., spinning, weaving, or farming are perceived as irrelevant by&#13;
parents and students alike;&#13;
*     Incentives such as playgrounds, teaching aids or activities, e.g., sports, music&#13;
or drama to make school more interesting, are lacking;&#13;
*     Teachers are often not qualified, poorly trained and supervised;&#13;
*     Gender bias is evident in both teaching materials and teaching staff who often&#13;
see girls as less intelligent;&#13;
*     Remedial help is seldom available; and&#13;
*     Textbooks are unattractive.&#13;
ST/SC ISSUES&#13;
6.           India's ST/SC  population, along with a history of discrimination, face&#13;
additional problems of poverty, physical isolation in sparsely populated habitations, and a&#13;
cultural and language divergence from the mainstream. These factors have kept enrollment,&#13;
retention and achievement rates low for these groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -                             Annex 15&#13;
7.            Access. A significant portion of the tribal groups in the DPEP II districts&#13;
inhabit locations with difficult terrains making it problematic for students to reach school and&#13;
for teachers to commute to their localities:&#13;
*     There are fewer schools in sparsely populated areas;&#13;
*     Schools, even one kilometer away, are often inaccessible due to difficult&#13;
terrain;&#13;
*     Parents, illiterate themselves, do not encourage school enrollment;&#13;
*     Teachers, particularly female teachers, are unwilling to serve in hardship&#13;
areas, and accommodations are not available;&#13;
*     Children have domestic and sibling responsibility which interfere with school&#13;
timings;&#13;
*      Students, particularly girls in tribal areas, require an escort to take them to&#13;
distant schools; and&#13;
*     Families of educated tribal girls are often subject to increased dowry requests.&#13;
8.            Retention. In Orissa, the Dhenkenal district has a SC dropout rate of 63&#13;
percent and 75 percent for tribals vs. a district figure of 49 percent; Kalahandi shows 59&#13;
percent for SC and 60 percent for ST vs. a district total of 55 percent; the predominantly&#13;
tribal district of Rayagada has an SC rate of 50 percent and ST rate of 58 percent vs. a district&#13;
level of 44 percent. This data confirms that the disadvantaged groups found it more difficult&#13;
to remain in school. The reasons are manifold:&#13;
*     There is a lack of parental encouragement;&#13;
*     The child's assistance for seasonal labor or daily chores takes priority over&#13;
school;&#13;
*     Tribal holidays are not accounted for in the school calendar;&#13;
*     The language gap and cultural gap between student and teacher is&#13;
discouraging;&#13;
*      Students face difficulty in completing homework assignments due to lack of&#13;
parental help and kerosene for light;&#13;
*     Parents cannot afford clothes for children to wear to school; and&#13;
*     Migratory families, particularly among the SC population, increase student&#13;
absenteeism.&#13;
9.            Quality. The quality of teaching in tribal areas is complicated by a cultural&#13;
gap between student and teacher, which is often accompanied by a language barrier. This&#13;
makes learning difficult and discourages the child from further study;&#13;
*     Text books are not available on time;&#13;
*     The curriculum does not reflect tribal activities and traditions;&#13;
*     Teachers are unaware of tribal customs and culture;&#13;
*     Teachers do not speak the tribal language. ST students do not understand the&#13;
language of instruction;&#13;

DPEP STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ISSUES&#13;
10.         To address these issues, DPEP introduced a bottom-up planning process.&#13;
After training by the DPEP bureau and the TSG, the districts were instructed to hold&#13;
orientation and planning meetings with local stakeholders: parents, teachers, VEC members,&#13;
representatives of women's groups, SC/ST populations as well as administrators. These&#13;
meetings were designed to elicit the views and suggestions of beneficiaries. This feedback&#13;
was used by the district planning teams to design strategies to improve the educational&#13;
environment. Table I of this Annex presents a district level description of participation,&#13;
identified needs and proposed responses.&#13;
11.         Access. To improve access, districts have proposed a two-prong approach: an&#13;
increase in the number of educational facilities and an awareness campaign designed to&#13;
encourage student enrollment. In SC/ST areas, creative solutions to meet the needs of&#13;
sparsely populated areas will be tried on an experimental basis. This will include residential&#13;
(ashram) schools, mobile schools in areas of migrant workers, and alternative schools or&#13;
NFEs in other areas. To combat community lethargy and in some cases resistance, awareness&#13;
and enrollment campaigns will be organized to focus on the value of education. Some&#13;
districts have proposed competitions between villages for increased enrollment and retention.&#13;
12.         To increase enrollment of girls, ECCE programs will provide childcare&#13;
services, freeing older siblings for school attendance. NFEs, which will allow flexibility in&#13;
school timings, will be established. A major effort will be made to hire female teachers to&#13;
provide appropriate role models for girls. Community awareness campaigns will be aided by&#13;
women's groups and mahila samitis; MTAs and PTAs will be supported; and VECs, once&#13;
activated, will by law have at least two female members.&#13;
13.         Retention.  Overall, attention will be paid to improving the school&#13;
infrastructure by repairing dilapidated buildings, constructing toilets, providing drinking&#13;
water and electricity. VECs will be responsible for assuring that maintenance continues.&#13;
Continual awareness programs will be conducted to ensure family acceptance and desire for&#13;
education. VECs will monitor the attendance of teachers and students. For girls, monetary&#13;
and material incentives will be provided and extended to cover all poor girls. Remedial&#13;
programs have been proposed to discourage dropout caused by frustration. A concerted&#13;
effort will be made to hire female teachers and, on an experimental basis, teacher's quarters&#13;
will be constructed where justified.&#13;
14.         Quality.  School curriculum and teacher competence are the two major&#13;
components of quality education. DPEP strategies will focus on training. A network of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -                          Annex 15&#13;
BRCs, CRCs, and an upgraded DIET will be responsible for conducting training&#13;
workshops; the SCERT, with the assistance of the NCERT, will develop modules on MLL,&#13;
multigrade teaching, gender orientation, tribal sensitivity, etc. Training will extend to&#13;
supervisory staff, ECCE and NFE instructors. Appointment of tribal and gender coordinators&#13;
at the state and in some cases the district level to assist in training and curriculum issues has&#13;
been proposed. Tribal language handbooks will be made available in selected districts.&#13;
15.         Textbook studies will be analyzed to ensure that an adequate number of books&#13;
can be made available to all students. Committees will review the texts to ensure that gender&#13;
and tribal bases are eliminated and that they are more attractive and relevant to all groups.&#13;
Supplemental reading materials will be developed and libraries provided to encourage&#13;
reading interest and skills.&#13;
16.         The curriculum will be revised to integrate MLL into all subjects. Innovative&#13;
teaching schemes will be encouraged, e.g., Joyful Learning. School and teacher contingency&#13;
funds will be provided to allow for the purchase and development of new teaching aids and&#13;
other innovative projects. Coordination of activities at the state and district level with tribal&#13;
institutes, Departments of Tribal Welfare, and Departments of Women's Affairs should result&#13;
in a more coordinated and relevant curriculum.&#13;
DPEP I EXPERIENCE: LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
17.         Changing the structure of education planning, addressing the needs of groups&#13;
historically removed from the educational mainstream and modifying long held cultural&#13;
biases requires time, creativity and skill. Taking into account the experience of DPEP I&#13;
districts can help shorten this process in DPEP It. Sharing workshops or interstate visits&#13;
should be arranged as soon as possible.&#13;
18.         The cooperative planning strategy has helped the districts develop skills in the&#13;
participatory process. The strengthening of the VECs and MTCs in Tamil Nadu has&#13;
broadened community input into the AWPB. Maharashtra shifted the micro-planning to the&#13;
block level to ensure community involvement. Evidence in Kamataka shows widespread&#13;
discussions occurred between community members, NGOs, teachers and experts along with&#13;
support from major institutions.&#13;
19.         Next to civil works, social mobilization campaigns comprise a major portion&#13;
of district budgets. A successful intervention in DPEP I is the Meena campaign in Assam&#13;
which uses animation films and comic books to stress the importance of education for girls.&#13;
Many awareness strategies adapted the effective methods developed by the Total Literacy&#13;
Campaigns.&#13;
20.         SCERT designed teacher training programs in Haryana have helped the&#13;
curriculum become more activity and child oriented. Kamataka has developed modules&#13;
which emphasis gender and tribal needs.  To assist in tribal focus, Madhya Pradesh has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 196 -                           Annex 15&#13;
deputed staff from the Tribal Welfare Department to the DIET. Assam has developed&#13;
materials in local languages. Tamil Nadu has relied on residential schools and NFEs.&#13;
21.          Gender programs have been strengthened by the integration of the Mahila&#13;
Samahkhya experience, the empowerment of women's groups and the revision of textbooks.&#13;
In Tamil Nadu, the mother-teacher council is being used to improve girls' participation in the&#13;
classroom, an escort service to address the security needs of girls has been introduced.&#13;
Haryana has increased the participation of women on VECs to 50 percent. Madhya Pradesh&#13;
has extensive experience in providing alternative schools for girls.&#13;
FUTURE&#13;
22.          Solutions to improving the level of enrollment, retention and achievement&#13;
rates in disadvantaged groups are not readily available. Limited national experience and&#13;
attention to their needs does not give district planning teams much to fall back on. DPEP by&#13;
focusing attention on these special groups is providing an opportunity for innovation. Yet&#13;
there is a caution: innovation implies a need for careful study, research and evaluation to&#13;
determine the demand, feasibility and impact of strategies. Wholesale plans to provide&#13;
alternate schools, residential schools, teachers' quarters or mobile schools are premature.&#13;
Districts are, therefore, now concentrating initially on analyzing present programs for their&#13;
effectiveness and cost benefits. Convergence with ongoing schemes, reliance on relevant&#13;
resources, and discussions with DPEP I states will cut down on needless experimentation.&#13;
Once satisfied that a scheme has merit, single units should be tried and evaluated before large&#13;
scale funds are committed.&#13;
23.          To facilitate DPEP, districts must develop activity schedules which reflect the&#13;
need for infrastructure development and micro-planning exercises as a preliminary step.&#13;
Once the structure is in place innovative schemes can be initiated. Examples of schemes&#13;
which require further evaluation and workshops to share the results before further expansion&#13;
are a mobile school in Chamba for migrant workers, teachers quarters in Orissa and an&#13;
ashram school for tribal students in Dang district in Gujarat.&#13;
24.          The Department of Education along with TSG must assist the state and district&#13;
teams in developing the capacity to analyze the information gained from social assessment&#13;
studies and the participatory meetings to design strategies that form the basis for AWP&amp;B.&#13;
By fostering an understanding of the utility of the method, greater care will be taken to&#13;
continue its usage.&#13;
PRIORITIES&#13;
25.         In several areas district programs need to be further developed for example,&#13;
specific programs addressing the needs of SC students, concentration on Tibetan refugees in&#13;
Himachal, and careful analysis of the needs of the disabled. Moreover, consideration will be&#13;
given increasingly to village driven issues as ultimately the beneficiaries have the largest&#13;
stake in the process. This includes the need to address more effectively supply and demand&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -                          Annex 15&#13;
issues such as location and type of facility to meet the needs of the local population , daily&#13;
and seasonal timings of school, adaptation of culturally relevant material into the curriculum.&#13;
Flexibility has been built into the program at the district level to allow community specific&#13;
changes. As implementation proceeds more specificity will be included in program&#13;
components, i.e. what type of awareness programs will be instituted, who will they address,&#13;
how will they be evaluated; how will the curriculum for NFEs (alternative schools) differ,&#13;
will students move into primary schools after NFE completion; who will ensure that tribal&#13;
culture is incorporated into the curriculum, how will it be done?&#13;
26.          Several other possible alternatives could be considered by the communities as&#13;
part of the DPEP program supporting innovative activity:&#13;
*     providing intensive teacher training to suitable local community members,&#13;
particularly in tribal areas. This will ensure knowledge of tribal culture and&#13;
eliminate accommodation issues;&#13;
*     complementing the curriculum with an introduction to handicrafts or&#13;
vocational skills into the curriculum; and&#13;
*     reviewing school schedule, i.e., 6 hours a day, 6 days a week may be modified&#13;
based on need.&#13;
27.          DPEP provides a vehicle for community involvement in education. Building&#13;
on that mobilization with support, monitoring and evaluation, education for all can become a&#13;
reality.&#13;

INDIA: District Primary Education Project II&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
1.          Supervision for DPEP II would be fully integrated with supervision for DPEP&#13;
I (Cr. 2661-IN) and UPBEP (Cr. 2509-IN) and managed from the New Delhi Resident&#13;
Mission. The IDA supervision of all three credits would be carried out through the joint&#13;
supervision process that has been developed in the first year of implementation for DPEP.&#13;
The joint supervision process has been designed to:&#13;
*     review  the national and state capacities to effectively manage the&#13;
implementation of DPEP;&#13;
spot check the implementation of the project on the ground through field visits&#13;
and the review of project reports;&#13;
-     provide advice to the DPEP Bureau and the State Implementation Societies&#13;
with regard to emerging implementation issues;&#13;
-     monitor the implementation of agreed action programs; and&#13;
*     create a framework for collaboration among donors supporting primary&#13;
education development in India.&#13;
The supervision of UPBEP so far has been carried out separately by IDA through bi-annual&#13;
supervision missions with participation by DOE/GOI.&#13;
2           So far two joint supervision missions have been carried out (March and&#13;
September 1994) and a third one is being planned for June 1996. All funding DPEP agencies&#13;
- European Community, IDA, Unicef, ODA and GOI - have assigned staff and consultants&#13;
to these supervision missions. The mission leadership is rotating among the agencies: IDA&#13;
led the first mission, the EC the second, and GOI is expected to lead the third. The missions&#13;
have functioned as a group of professionals providing advice to the DPEP Bureau rather than&#13;
as a group of agency representatives. The findings and recommendations of the joint&#13;
supervision mission have been the basis for IDA internal supervision reporting and IDA has&#13;
communicated its comments in a follow-up letter to the DPEP Bureau.&#13;
3.          The effectiveness of the joint DPEP I supervision missions has been&#13;
considerably enhanced by:&#13;
internal supervision missions carried out by the DPEP Bureau and the TSG;&#13;
quarterly reports, supplemented by an annual reports including audited&#13;
accounts, prepared by the SISs;&#13;
bi-annual progress reports prepared by the DPEP Bureau; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 203 -                        Annex 16&#13;
training of DPEP staff in procurement and disbursement procedures by&#13;
specialist staff from NDO.&#13;
4.           The DPEP Bureau with support of the TSG has supervised the implementation&#13;
of DPEP in the project districts. Staff in the TSG have led this supervision effort supported&#13;
by short-term consultants drawn from the pool of national experts from national and state&#13;
level institutions developed through:&#13;
*     training in supervision procedures and techniques in the Lal Bahadur Shastri&#13;
National Academy (LBSNAA) in Mussoori; and&#13;
*     participation of national experts in UPBEP and DPEP I supervision missions&#13;
5.          In addition, staff in the state projects offices have been exposed to a series of&#13;
training programs related to the implementation of DPEP, including training on procurement&#13;
and disbursement issues carried out by specialist staff based in the New Delhi office. As a&#13;
result, several states are taking increasing responsibility for the supervision of the&#13;
implementation of the project at the district level, the provision of planning support to district&#13;
level staff and the pre-appraisal of annual work program and budgets prepared by district&#13;
level staff.&#13;
6.           The operationalization of a computerized project management information&#13;
system (PMIS) and education management information system (EMIS), which will provide&#13;
up-to-date informaticn to project managers in DPEP at the district level and above, is&#13;
expected to further strengthen the information base of the joint supervision effort.&#13;
Complemented by a program of research and evaluation that is gradually broadening its&#13;
scope, the future joint supervision missions will be able to draw on a much richer and much&#13;
more reliable information base than has been possible in the first twelve months of&#13;
implementation.&#13;
7.           The current DPEP supervision strategy needs to be adjusted to take account of&#13;
the increased scope and complexity of the program as it expands to increase the coverage to&#13;
120 districts and 13 states, including Uttar Pradesh. To ensure effective supervision in a&#13;
program of this magnitude the following steps will be implemented:&#13;
*     explicit delegation of the supervision responsibility to the state offices in all&#13;
DPEP I states and UP starting April 1997;&#13;
*     a gradual decentralization of supervision responsibility in the second&#13;
generation DPEP states;&#13;
*     full operationalization of the PMIS in the first generation states by July 1996&#13;
and in the second generation states by January 1997;&#13;
*     implementation of the education management information system in all states&#13;
starting September 1996; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -                        Annex 16&#13;
full operationalization of the research, monitoring and evaluation program,&#13;
including the monitoring in sample districts, focusing especially on qualitative&#13;
and process indicators by September 1996 in already participating states and&#13;
gradual expansion into the second generation states.&#13;
8.           The supervision of DPEP I, DPEP II and UPBEP will be integrated as&#13;
follows:&#13;
*     SPOs will institute a process of systematic supervision of the districts. Each&#13;
district will be visited by state teams at least twice a year. The SPO will&#13;
submit formnal supervision summary reports in a standard format for review to&#13;
the DPEP Bureau. A supervision plan will be included in the APB prepared&#13;
by the state.&#13;
*     The DPEP Bureau will supervise each state once a year through a national&#13;
supervision mission which will take place at different points in time in. This&#13;
mission will (i) review the effectiveness of the state supervision; (ii) visit three&#13;
or four districts in each state for an on-the-ground spot check of&#13;
implementation progress (double that number in UP and MP); and (iii) review&#13;
the APB prepared by the districts and the states. A format for a summary&#13;
supervision report, including a set of performance indicators, will be&#13;
developed. These supervision summaries would be provided to the donors&#13;
concerned. The DPEP Bureau will attempt to ensure that each project district&#13;
will be visited once a year by either ajoint or a national supervision mission.&#13;
3     A joint supervision mission will supervise the capacity of the DPEP Bureau to&#13;
effectively carry out the state level supervision, twice a year for about two&#13;
weeks.  Each mission would visit six states, to allow all states a joint&#13;
supervision mission visit once a year.&#13;
*     Every year, starting in 1997, a supervision workshop would take place on one&#13;
or at most two selected topics to bring together all states. In this workshops&#13;
states would report on their experience with a specific components of the&#13;
DPEP program (e.g., micro planning, NFE, ECCE, civil works , teacher&#13;
training, multigrade teaching, etc.). The topics will be selected by the DPEP&#13;
Bureau in consultation with the donors. The workshop would typically last&#13;
one week and take place outside Delhi in one of the states that has some&#13;
notable achievements. An external speaker could be invited to deliver a&#13;
keynote address on the selected topic.&#13;
*     At this workshop the DPEP Bureau would present an overview of project&#13;
achievements, while each state would present its annual report and an&#13;
overview of its achievements in an exhibition space.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 205 -                        Annex 16&#13;
In addition, a report on (i) findings of completed DPEP-funded research and&#13;
evaluation studies; and (ii) new research and evaluation proposals approved for&#13;
funding by DPEP would be available for discussion.&#13;
9.          In the first two years a special supervision effort would be required to (i)&#13;
monitor the start-up of the DPEP program in the new states (Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and&#13;
Orissa); and (ii) review the effectiveness of the national appraisal process for the expansion&#13;
districts in already participating states where IDA will conduct a special prior (before the start&#13;
of implementation) review of the national appraisal process in at least one district in each of&#13;
the eight 'bxpansion" states (total districts should not exceed 16) and - assuming a positive&#13;
assessment of the national appraisal process - an ex-post review of a 20 percent sample of the&#13;
remaining expansion districts. These appraisal review missions would include a review of&#13;
implementation progress in each of the participating states. As part of the joint supervision&#13;
process, other donors providing support for the national program or to a particular state,&#13;
would be invited by IDA in consultation with GOI, to participate in some of these appraisal&#13;
review missions. Starting the third year, two joint supervision missions would be organized,&#13;
each covering six DPEP states. In-depth reviews would be organized in 1997, 1999 and in&#13;
2001 (paras 3.33 and 5.3(b)). The first one would replace the mid-term review of DPEP I&#13;
planned for the first semester of 1998.&#13;
10.         Supervision task management would be placed with the Education Group in&#13;
the Resident Mission, staffed as follows:&#13;
Education Adviser/Principal Education Specialist&#13;
Education Planner&#13;
National Staff/ Long term Consultant&#13;
Local Support Consultant Contracts for civil works&#13;
Short term Local Technical Consultants&#13;
This will allow IDA to provide continuous implementation support, especially through&#13;
participation in the many thematic workshops designed to exchange implementation&#13;
experience organized by the DPEP Bureau.&#13;
11.          The model supervision schedule presented below has been designed to ensure&#13;
that: (i) IDA supervision objectives are met; (ii) IDA semi-annual supervision report&#13;
requirements mesh with the supervision requirements of other donors; and (iii) IDA technical&#13;
support during the supervision process is optimized. States would typically be visited by&#13;
teams of two staff with different professional backgrounds. UP and MP would be visited by&#13;
two teams The technical expertise shown is indicative after the first year of the project. Actual&#13;
technical expertise would be determined on the basis of the implementation issues.&#13;

            India - Second District Primary Education Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Second District Primary Education
            Project will assist the Department of Education and the
            government of India to extend the District Primary Education
            Program (DPEP) into about 50 to 60 new districts chosen from
            Uttar Pradesh and the seven states already participating in
            the First District Primary Education Project (DPEP I), and
            up to 15 districts in three new states ( Gujarat, Himachal
            Pradesh and Orissa). Like DPEP I, this project will build
            national, state, district, and sub-district level managerial
            and professional capacity for the sustainable development of
            primary education in the project states and will support
            district-based activities aimed at improving access to
            education, reducing dropout and increasing learning
            achievement, with special emphasis on interventions that
            will target female and scheduled caste/scheduled tribe
            students, as well as children with mild to moderate
            disabilities. The project will consist of the following four
            components: 1) building and strengthening state
            institutional capacity in project states; 2) improving the
            quality of, reducing dropout from, and expanding access to
            primary education by strengthening the capacity of district
            and sub-district institutions to plan and manage program
            delivery; developing community participation and awareness;
            improving teacher in-service training, learning materials
            and teaching aids; and constructing new classrooms and
            improving existing school facilities in participating
            districts; 3) developing a distance education program; and
            4) continuing the national management structure support for DPEP.
