Some of the harmful impacts of open defecation are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
n	  Spread of diarrheal diseases: Preventable diseases&#13;
    such as diarrhea linked to open defecation are among&#13;
    the highest causes of illness and death, especially of&#13;
    children, in developing countries (see Box).&#13;
    Feces defecated in the open come back to us through&#13;
    many ways, as shown in the F-diagram on fecal-oral&#13;
    transmission routes&#13;

2. Which are the three key hygiene behaviors that               specified design. This assumption was proved wrong&#13;
lead to the greatest reduction in diarrheal diseases?           because open defecation is a traditional behavior&#13;
                                                                in rural areas where open space is readily available&#13;
The F-diagram on fecal-oral transmission routes shows           and safe sanitation is not a felt need. Therefore, the&#13;
that safe sanitation is a combination of facilities and         key issue of motivating behavior change to end open&#13;
hygiene behaviors. The following three hygiene behaviors        defecation and use of constructed toilets was not&#13;

3. Why did the Central Rural Sanitation Program of the              often of high cost relative to household incomes&#13;
1980s fail?                                                  	 â&#128;¢	 Latrine construction took place largely through&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. What is Community-driven Total Sanitation?               6. Is there a difference between Community-driven&#13;
                                                            Total Sanitation and Total Sanitation Campaign?&#13;
Through a process of facilitation, Community-driven Total&#13;
Sanitation focuses on identifying triggers that lead to     Both Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) and Community-&#13;
self-realization among community members of serious         driven Total Sanitation have the same goal, that is,&#13;
public health risks posed by the failure to prevent open    Total Sanitation. The only difference is that TSC is a&#13;
defecation by some individuals. On the one hand, this       program and Community-driven Total Sanitation is an&#13;
approach empowers the community to take action to           approach which can be used to strengthen the TSC. At&#13;
find solutions to poor sanitary practices without relying   the heart of TSC and Community-driven Total Sanitation,&#13;
on external subsidies. On the other hand, it recognizes     is a demand-led methodology to total sanitation, which&#13;
the importance of local governments and private             stresses on awareness creation and health education&#13;
sanitation suppliers/entrepreneurs to achieving scale and   to create demand for safe sanitation. Both TSC and&#13;
sustainability. The key principles of Community-driven      Community-driven Total Sanitation place the onus on&#13;
Total Sanitation can be summarized as follows:              community action without reliance on external subsidies.&#13;
n	 Focus on outcomes rather than building toilets           Similarly, both Community-driven Total Sanitation and&#13;
n	 Focus on collective behavior change rather than          TSC advocate for informed technology choice and an&#13;
    mobilizing individual households                        outcome-based strategy based on elimination of&#13;
n	 Informed choice on a variety of technological options    open defecation.&#13;
    to get people on the sanitation ladder&#13;
n	 Promote private suppliers/entrepreneurs to respond&#13;
&#13;
    to demand&#13;
n	 Promote the role of appropriate institutional&#13;
&#13;
    frameworks in achieving scale and sustainability&#13;
n	 Focus on incentives that reward outcomes rather than&#13;
&#13;
    provide upfront hardware subsidy&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   5&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           Rural Sanitation and Hygiene Practices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7. Why focus on collective rather than individual behavior change?&#13;
&#13;
Open defecation is a private behavior that has public consequences. Therefore, even if a few individual households&#13;
switch to safe, fixed point defecation, the overall risk of disease and contamination continues to be high (see case&#13;
study below). Most conventional sanitation programs promote sanitation from the supply-side, focusing on toilet&#13;
construction for individual households. By contrast, the total sanitation approach focuses on mobilizing demand for safe&#13;
sanitation at the community level rather than establish individual household contacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Why target collective behavior change to end open defecation?&#13;
                                                                                                                                                   40&#13;

A village is considered ODF only when safe disposal of        sanitation programs focused on providing subsidized&#13;
human fecal matter is ensured at all times. This means        toilets rather than motivating their usage. It was assumed&#13;
that even if every household in a village has a toilet, the   that people defecate in the open because they were&#13;

n	   Children defecate in open drains or nearby fields as a&#13;

n	   Villagers use toilets only when convenient, for          the focus has shifted from providing subsidized toilets&#13;

very fast?                                                                The contents of the pit may be used as fertilizer&#13;

n	   A 1x1m depth pit latrine which is used daily by five                 pit can be dug out (it is easier to dig than undisturbed&#13;
     to six people, will take four to five years to get filled            soil) and the pit can be used again&#13;
     up. This is because 80-90 percent of feces is water&#13;
     which soaks away while the solids accumulate in                 27. Is the compost derived from latrine pits safe?&#13;
     the pit&#13;
n	   In a dual pit latrine, the second pit can be used once          Yes. Left for 12-18 months in the pit, the excreta turns&#13;
     the first pit is nearly full. The first pit is then filled up   into biofertilizer. In a dual pit latrine, it can be safely taken&#13;
     with soil. After two years, feces in the first pit will         out without the risk of health hazards provided there is no&#13;
     have completely decomposed and even the most                    seepage of effluent from the adjoining pit which is in use.&#13;

            This report presents the following: (1)
            why is it important to stop open defecation?; (2) which are
            the three key hygiene behaviors that lead to the greatest
            reduction in diarrheal diseases?; (3) why did the Central
            Rural Sanitation Program of the 1980s fail?; (4) how is the
            total sanitation campaign approach different from the
            central rural sanitation program?; (5) what is
            community-driven total sanitation?; (6) is there a
            difference between community-driven total sanitation and
            total sanitation campaign?; (7) why focus on collective
            rather than individual behavior change?; (8) how can below
            poverty line families afford latrines without subsidy?; (9)
            what is the Nirmal gram puraskar?; and (10) what is the role
            of gram panchayats in the total sanitation campaign?
