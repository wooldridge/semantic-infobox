Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:               Republic of Moldova&#13;
Implementing Agency:  Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF)&#13;
Beneficiaries:          MAF; National Institute for Viticulture and Oenology (NIVO); Research&#13;
Institute of Fruit Production ("Codru't), Research Institute for Field Crops&#13;
("Selectsia'); Research Institute for Maize and Sorgum ("Porumbeni");&#13;
Veterinary and Livestock Research Institute ("TeviJ"); agro-industry managers;&#13;
Fanners&#13;
Poverty Category:       not applicable'&#13;
Amount:                 US$ 10 million [equivalent]&#13;
Loan Terms:             Standard amortization terms, grace period and interest rate for LIBOR-based&#13;
US$ denominated loans.&#13;
Commitment Fee:         0.75 % on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less&#13;
any waiver.&#13;
Financing Plan:         see Schedule A&#13;
Economic Analysis:       As the direct benefits from R&amp;D (improved product quality and lower&#13;
production costs) could not be achieved without additional investments in&#13;
improved production and marketing of key crops, an "affordability" approach&#13;
was used. To achieve a 10% economic rate of return on research, the net&#13;
present value (NPV) of export benefits directly attributable to research&#13;
investments need not be more than 8.6% of the NPV of the added value of&#13;
projected incremental exports over the next 15 years -- an achievable level.&#13;

1.    Poverty groups are not directly targeted benficiaries under this Project. However most of the farmers are near or&#13;
below te poverty line. The project will, in the short term, have indirect impact on farmers' productivity, while in the longer&#13;
run the benefits will be direct.&#13;

MOLDOVA&#13;
THE FIRST AGRICULTURE PROJECT&#13;
I. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR&#13;
A. The Macro-economy and Agriculture&#13;
1.1          Moldova, which gained independence from the formner Soviet Union (FSU) in 1991, lies&#13;
in southeastern Europe sharing borders with Romania and the Ukraine. It is a small, densely settled&#13;
country with a population of 4.4 million; slightly more than half of the population live in rural areas.&#13;
Moldova initiated a reform program as early as 1990 aimed at creating a market economy. In March&#13;
1993, Parliament adopted a comprehensive action program for the stabilization and recovery of the&#13;
economy. Shortly thereafter, a new currency, the Lei, was introduced and supported with firm financial&#13;
policies. Although progress has been hampered by the legacy of central planning practices, significant&#13;
results have been achieved under the macroeconomic stabilization program. Budget transfers to enterprises&#13;
were cut to about 1% of public expenditure in 1993 from 21% in 1992, and the largest consumer subsidies&#13;
were eliminated in May 1994. Annual inflation fell from almost 2,000% in 1992 to 1% in the third&#13;
quarter in 1995. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita fell over 50% between 1990 and 1993,&#13;
and there was a further decline in 1994 of 22% to US$870. A turnaround, and a small but positive&#13;
growth rate in GDP was recorded in 1995.&#13;
1.2          Moldova has followed a tight monetary policy since late 1993, supported by an&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Systemic Transformation Facility (STF) and two stand-by&#13;
arrangements. Although monetary policy changes have succeeded in sharply reducing inflation, they have&#13;
not been accompanied by equally far-reaching structural changes in the economy. Severe problems of&#13;
inter-enterprise arrears and illiquidity continue to constrain all commercial and industrial activity, including&#13;
agriculture. The combination of monetary policy, fiscal policy and administration, and enterprise behavior&#13;
is not yet balanced adequately to provide strong support for sustained stabilization or growth of the real&#13;
sectors of the economy. A deepening of the initiated structural changes, especially in the enterprise and&#13;
trade sectors, is needed.&#13;
1.3          Agriculture Sector. Between 1989 and 1993 Moldovan agriculture and its food industries'&#13;
output declined 33%, due to a series of shocks.) Output fell an additional 26% in 1994, due to severe&#13;
drought, inadequate financing of agricultural operations, and a decline in domestic demand and export&#13;
possibilities. Favorable weather in 1995 helped to stabilize agricultural production, but at a relatively low&#13;
level.&#13;
1.4          Agriculture accounts for about 40% of Moldova's Net Material Product and employs one&#13;
third of the labor force. In addition, processing of agricultural products accounts for 40% of industrial&#13;
output and 20% of industrial employment. Agricultural and food products accounted for over 50% of&#13;
Moldova's exports in the last years of the FSU. This output was heavily dependent on imported inputs&#13;
of feedgrains and agricultural inputs. In turn, Moldova's exports were based almost entirely on the&#13;
centrally planned system of specialized production areas, and directed distribution, across the entire FSU.&#13;
I     including: a large unfavorable adjustment in terms of trade; increase in input and energy prices to international levels;&#13;
severe droughts in 1992 and in 1994; and the economic disruption associated with the break-up of the former Soviet Union (FSU).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                    Chapter I&#13;
1.5           Agriculture is likely to remain the dominant sector of the Moldovan economy and could&#13;
lead economic growth in the short-run. More than 50% of the population, directly or indirectly, depend&#13;
on agriculture as a source of income. The country is densely populated and agricultural land is fanned&#13;
relatively intensively. Moldovan agriculture is characterized by a high proportion of viticulture and&#13;
horticulture production. These are typically high value and labor intensive crops and, once processed, are&#13;
the country's major exports. Fertile soils, a favorable climate, well-educated agricultural specialists, and&#13;
an abundance of low-cost labor will form the basis for successful agriculture after the restructuring of the&#13;
sector is completed.&#13;
B. Sector Overview2&#13;
1.6           Moldova's agriculture is well favored with a moderate climate and excellent soils. Eighty&#13;
percent of the soils are chernozems that rank among the most fertile in the world.  Production is&#13;
constrained by erratic rainfall (drought frequency 6 to 7 years in 10) and low levels of groundwater&#13;
resources in the south of the country. Important products include wine, horticulture, grains, tobacco, and&#13;
livestock products (hogs and poultry). In part, the dominance of livestock (dependent on imported&#13;
feedgrains) is a remnant of former Soviet Union (FSU) central planning decisions, which placed an&#13;
emphasis on Moldova's role as a supplier of both horticultural and livestock products to its pan-Union&#13;
food supply system.&#13;
1.7           Since Independence in 1991, there has been an overall decline in sector output, as the&#13;
systems adjusts to real market prices, increasing export competition, and reduced domestic demand (see&#13;
also environment impact -- Box 1.1).&#13;
Box 1.1: Environmental Impact of Agriculture&#13;
During the period of the Soviet Union, fertilizers and pesticides were liberally applied with little&#13;
concern for environmental impact. Groundwater resources became polluted both from agricultural&#13;
chemicals run-off and from the effluent of the large livestock complexes. Further, the agro-&#13;
processing plants were not operated with environmentally appropriate waster disposal systems. High&#13;
levels of pesticide residues were also reported. With the post-independence down-turn in the&#13;
economy, the levels of application of agro-chemicals have been significantly reduced, and agro-&#13;
chemical runoff is today not a significant pollution source. Thie livestock and agro-processing&#13;
complexes have reduced their operating volumes, and consequently, pollution from these point-&#13;
sources has declined.&#13;
However, this could quickly be reversed to the previous levels of pollution if there is a return to past&#13;
levels of economic activity without the introduction of better agro-chemicals, and better controls on&#13;
levels and methods of application. Similarly, to prevent point-source pollution, the livestock and&#13;
agro-processing complexes require investments in effluent and wastewater treatment as an integral&#13;
part of their restructuring and expansion programs.&#13;
2      This section based on "Moldova Agriculture Sector Review," (Rept. No. 1258 1-MD, Feb., 1995), with recent updates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Agriculture Sector                                                                  3&#13;
Livestock: Since 1991, the loss of export markets in the FSU, high feed prices, and reduced&#13;
domestic demand have severely impacted the livestock sector. Meat production decreased by&#13;
40%, dairy production by 30%, and egg production by 46%, between 1991 and 1993. Livestock&#13;
production continued to decline in 1994 as the drought worsened feed shortages, and has held&#13;
steady in 1995 due to a static domestic market and low export prospects. Further downsizing can&#13;
be expected over time.&#13;
Horticulture: Fruit and vegetable production is important in Moldovan agriculture covering about&#13;
10% of the arable land, but contributing to about 28% (18% and 10%, respectively), of Moldova's&#13;
earnings from food exports to the FSU in 1993. Production of horticultural crops fluctuates&#13;
mainly due to drought, low productivity, poor irrigation systems, and unreliable marketing&#13;
channels, (e.g. vegetable production in 1993 was 39% lower than in 1986). Potential areas of&#13;
improvement encompass the full range of activities in horticulture, including availability and&#13;
choice of plant varieties, crop management, post-harvest treatment, and processing and packaging&#13;
of finished products.&#13;
Viticulture: Wine production also plays an important role in Moldovan agriculture with about 8%&#13;
of the agricultural land under vineyards.  Wine production represents one of the major&#13;
comparative advantages of the country and has good medium-term development prospects.&#13;
However, a majority of the wine products are of low quality and need to be improved in order&#13;
to be internationally competitive. The wine industry can be improved through increasing grape&#13;
yields and improving the quality of wine products, improved processing, adoption of standardized&#13;
packaging and improved marketing.&#13;
1.8          The rural economy is presently experiencing significant de-monetization, with both the&#13;
fanners and the processors being heavily indebted. There is a dominance of barter trade both for domestic&#13;
and international transactions by the large agro-processing complexes (formerly state-owned, and now&#13;
privatized but not effectively restructured or efficient). Some competition is now emerging as a result of&#13;
de-monopolization and privatization of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in agricultural trading and&#13;
processing. Small and medium scale processors, and informal traders, are emerging.&#13;
1.9          Due to tight credit policies, concessional financing to primary production and processors&#13;
has been very limited in recent years. The Government (GOM) does not intend to provide concessional&#13;
financing in the future; rather, financing would become the responsibility of the banking sector from its&#13;
own, and mobilized, resources. During reform and restructuring of the financial sector, financial resources&#13;
to agriculture, a perceived high risk sector, are expected to remain severely limited.&#13;
1.10         The consequent scarcity of working capital from the formal financial markets has resulted&#13;
in crops not being harvested because the agro-processors could not purchase them. Some of this "surplus"&#13;
found its way into informal fresh produce trading in neighboring countries' (predominantly in Ukraine and&#13;
Belarus). The continued economic activity of the agricultural sector during the transition has been, in&#13;
large part, a result of the emergence of the informal sector, based on the bartering of "surplus" fresh&#13;
produce and processed produce (given as payment-in-kind for wages to enterprise workers, or as payment&#13;
for the raw material supply from the farms). These goods were bartered for scarce essentials (fuel, agro-&#13;
chemicals and spare parts) obtained from neighboring countries.&#13;

1.11          The Agriculture Sector Review' recommended for the medium term, that Moldova's&#13;
strategy should emphasize:&#13;
*      yield and efriciency enhancement, through public investment in agricultural research,&#13;
education and extension;&#13;
*      promotion of agricultural exports-led growth, through liberalized pricing and trade in&#13;
agricultural inputs and products, improvement of product quality, development of new&#13;
markets, marketing channels and marketing institutions; and&#13;
*      sector structural reforms in production  through  rapid de-monopolization  and&#13;
privatization of agro-processors and traders, with parallel farm restructuring, privatization&#13;
and land reform, the development of land markets and adequate rural (non-concessional)&#13;
financial services, and the development of new sector institutions, both public and private.&#13;
1.12         The Role of New Technology: The comparative advantage of agriculture in Moldova lies&#13;
predominantly in the production of high value crops, such as grapes, fruits, vegetables, some medicinal&#13;
and aromatic plants, and in seed and planting material production. To support the production and improve&#13;
the export potential of high value crops, agricultural research needs to focus on the adaptation of foreign&#13;
crop varieties to the local climate and the drought risk; improved quality of food and agricultural products;&#13;
mechanization adapted to the changing land tenure pattern; improved soil fertility practices and crop&#13;
protection (including integrated pest management (IPM)) to reduce both production costs and the negative&#13;
impact of agro-chemicals residues on groundwater and food quality (Box 1.1); efficient and economical&#13;
irrigation; and improved technical and economic crop production and agri-business management.&#13;
1.13         To improve productivity and expand agricultural exports, agriculture would need to utilize&#13;
new production technologies appropriate for high value crops. The full range of improved technologies&#13;
are needed, e.g. high yielding seeds; integrated pest management; disease resistant new plant breeds;&#13;
drought tolerance; energy-efficient smaller-scale farm mechanization; water-conserving irrigation; plastic&#13;
tunnels and greenhouses; etc., all adapted to Moldova's conditions. In addition, new technologies will be&#13;
essential to ensure the transformation from extensive large-scale collectivized farming systems (now&#13;
characterized by excess under-utilized labor) to more cost-efficient smaller scale farning, on scarce land&#13;
resources, with intensive land use, a focus on high value crops, and limited capital and labor (mostly&#13;
family) resources. Moldova's "agricultural knowledge system" -- agricultural research, education and&#13;
extension -- will be critical to the success of this technology-facilitated transformation.&#13;
C. The "Agriculture Knowledge System"&#13;
1.14         The "agriculture knowledge system" consists of:&#13;
*      three universities teaching agricultural sciences, and a number of technical schools;&#13;
*      18 agricultural research institutes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF),&#13;
complemented by basic sciences research under the Moldova Academy of Sciences&#13;
(Box 1.2); and&#13;
*      MAF's regional network of agricultural extension staff.&#13;

1.15           The existing agricultural knowledge system has an unsustainable demand for public&#13;
resources. There are inherent problems with the multi-institutional and multi-tier approach inherited from&#13;
the FSU. There is a significant lack of integration of research, education and extension, to the detriment&#13;
of farmers, educators, researchers and students. Its output is, by and large, not adapted to agriculture&#13;
operating in an open competitive economy. MAF recognizes the need to tackle these problems, but it&#13;
does not have the resources to do this. A vision of the future needs of agriculture, the role of new&#13;
technology and the knowledge system, has yet to emerge from the stakeholders. Without this vision, and&#13;
an overall consensus around it, no rationalization of the system can commence.4 Nevertheless, even in&#13;
the absence of an overall strategy, immediate priority areas for public investment have been identified&#13;
(relevant to whatever future form the knowledge system will take -- para 2.5) with the initial focus on&#13;
research capabilities to introduce new technologies for key export crops, especially for viticulture and&#13;
horticulture.&#13;
D. Land Reform and Farm Restructuring&#13;
1.16           Land reform and restructuring of farms has proceeded relatively slowly (Box 1.3). The&#13;
first stage of the land reform aimed at the distribution of land for household plots (average size 0.3ha) to&#13;
the rural population. This first stage is substantially complete, although title documents have not been&#13;
distributed to all new owners. Agricultural land subject to privatization was to have been transferred in&#13;
the second stage of land reform, which began slowly in late 1992, accelerated in the summer of 1993, but&#13;
was suspended in November, 1994. The second phase of land reform was resumed in mid-1995 on the&#13;
basis of the Land Code as amended by Parliament in February, 1995.&#13;

system (Chapwer 3).&#13;

"Collective farms" are those sovkhozes and kolkhozes, not restructured, but where the state has no claim to the ownership&#13;
of the land.&#13;
"(Joint) Stock companies" are corporatized former sovkhozes and kolkhozes that have not undergone any significant&#13;
additional restructuring&#13;
"Cooperatives" are privatized sub-sets of the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes where the land is an indivisible asset of a&#13;
production cooperative, and not of the individual members of a cooperative.&#13;
"Individual farmers" and "Farmers' associations" are those individuals who exited from the collectives with individual&#13;
land shares that have not been placed into the asset pool of a production entity other than that of the owner's -- the&#13;
emergent "private farmers."&#13;
"Household Plots" including those plots private individuals and those owned by members who ave not exited from the&#13;
former sovkhozes and kolkhozes.&#13;
1.17             This amendment included the decisions to:&#13;
extend the circle of eligible persons for firee land entitlements, to employees of inter-farm&#13;
and service enterprises and some workers in the rural social sector;&#13;

The Agriculture Sector                                                                                    7&#13;
*       limit the minimum  size of land allowed to be taken out from a farm  to the size of one&#13;
crop rotation field' at that specific farm; and&#13;
*       to require only a "qualified farmer" certified by local authorities to manage any of the&#13;
newly formed farms.&#13;
1.18            These measures were justified by the legislators as a response to increasing tensions in&#13;
rural areas among those who were not included in the list of beneficiaries of the original land reform, as&#13;
well as concerns by MAF and GOM regarding the fragmentation and improper use of agricultural land&#13;
as a result of the implementation of the initial legislation. While the decision of the Parliament to modify&#13;
the land reform procedure is understandable, the amendments have had negative consequences for farm&#13;
restructuring. The amendment issued in February, 1995 has seriously compromised the rights of&#13;
individuals to exit from a large-scale farm and to establish new private farms,6 and consequently these&#13;
changes were not welcomed by the farming population.7 The early 1995 status of the land reform, just&#13;
prior to the change in legislation, is shown in Box 1.3. "True" private farming is represented by categories&#13;
2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 - only 16.7% of agricultural land area, and yet 99.75% of all land holders (including the&#13;
small household plot holders'). As the freeing up of exit rights occurred only early in 1996 (para. 1.19),&#13;
and is temporarily suspended from the beginning of April 1996 until the end of the 1996 harvest, these&#13;
statistics remain a reasonable representation of the current position.&#13;
1.19            The Land Code introduced post-independence established a moratorium on selling any land&#13;
received under privatization and land reform measures until 2001. The moratorium for urban land and&#13;
rral housing land, as well as household plots and orchards, was lifted on January 1, 1995. This measure&#13;
has already created a limited land market in Moldova and is a progressive step forward. Selling of land&#13;
shares inside the large-scale farning structures has recently become possible. At the beginning of 1996,&#13;
the Prime Minister informed Parliament that the Cabinet has endorsed legislative reform for the rural land&#13;
code, as proposed by the State's President. This proposal will remove the moratorium on rural land sales&#13;
(previously set at 2001), and permit immediate trading of rural land parcels. It is now the Cabinet's stated&#13;
policy that farm land should be treated under law as any other tradable commodity. Very recently the&#13;
Constitutional Court ruled certain provisions of the 1995 revision of the Land Code to be unconstitutional.&#13;
The practical implications of this move are as yet unclear.&#13;
1.20             It is also not clear at this time: (a) the extent to which the proposed revisions to the land&#13;
code will permit a range of land reform and fann restructuring options (e.g. the exit of individual farmers,&#13;
with personal title to identified land parcels and possession of other farm assets from their former&#13;
5       This is an FSU agronomic concept which defines the size of a field required to achieve a multiple crop rotation over&#13;
several seasons, where the rotation is designed for agronomic productivity and fertility conservation. In the Moldovan context, this&#13;
applied to annual cropped land, and would mean fields of between 30 and 100 ha, depending on location, soil fertility, and agro-&#13;
climatic conditions. At an average allocation per family of 1.5 ha, of which over SOff (on average) would be in fruit orchards and&#13;
vineyards, legal compliance requires group exit of between 60 and 200 individuals.&#13;
6       defined as non-collective farming, i.e., for the farmer's 'own account," on rented or personally owned land.&#13;
7       Systematic surveys, interviews and consultations with farmers and rural elites was carried out as a part of project&#13;
preparation. The results of this survey are reflected in this section (se also Through Farmers' Eyes: Stud on Land Priw4tzton&#13;
In Moldova, Badina, 0. and S. Raddulescu; M. Cernea, ed. (forthcoming World Bank Staff Working Paper)).&#13;

collectives, or newly formed smaller cooperatives); or (b) if Parliament will agree to the lifting of the rural&#13;
land sale moratorium, or be prepared to go even further in the necessary reforms and reverse its early&#13;
1995 decisions that introduced restrictions on rural land reform and farm restructuring options.&#13;
Consideration is also now being given by GOM to permitting the formation of rural service cooperatives:&#13;
this will move the rural sector into a more flexible mode of operation and enable farmers to be able to&#13;
obtain services which were previously the monopoly of the ex-sovkhozes and ex-kolkhozes.&#13;
1.21          Further progress with rural land reform and farm restructuring is critical to the overall&#13;
economic growth of the agriculture sector, and the entire economy. The Bank has expressed its serious&#13;
concerns to GOM, and has indicated that further changes to the Land Code and related legislation are&#13;
advisable to give investors confidence in the medium term sustainability of the agriculture sector. Donors&#13;
have expressed similar serious concerns. The Bank has indicated that investments in the agriculture sector,&#13;
beyond this first proposed project, will be conditional on significant progress in rural land reform (Chapter&#13;
2). To assist in progress to equitable land reform, funding for the development of enabling and related&#13;
legislation (e.g. laws related to the rural land market and land ownership registration and transfers, the&#13;
legal provisions for establishing service cooperatives, clarification of land ownership rights, etc.) would&#13;
be available under this Project (Chapter 3).&#13;
1.22          If a wider concept of rural land reform and farmn restructuring is embraced by Parliament,&#13;
a farming sector based on a variety of farm sizes and management systems is expected to emerge in&#13;
response to crop-specific technologies and social and economic considerations. Farm sizes would range&#13;
from large "corporate farms," to smaller partnerships, and also small-cropped single family farms. This&#13;
development would also widen the range of efficiencies and technologies, from export-oriented, profit-&#13;
maximizing farms to subsistence-oriented farms. This development will be dependent on individual skills&#13;
and preferences, capital resources, and the transfers of new technologies to the emerging farrners.&#13;
Preventing a downward slide into subsistence of the smaller (family) farms, will require (aside from on-&#13;
farm investments and access to rural services and finance) significant levels of entrepreneurship&#13;
development and improvements in the technical skills of the new farmers.&#13;
E. Sector Institutions&#13;
1.23          The sector is administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF), through its&#13;
regional and district offices. MAF, on behalf of GOM, continues, in the mode of a centrally planned&#13;
economy, to administer the sector's "production oversight" of primary and processed products, trade&#13;
promotion, rural land reform, as well as providing some (minimal) regulatory functions and coordinating&#13;
the sector's research system (para. 1.14 et seq.).&#13;
1.24          The remnants of the centrally planned administration of the sector are represented by the&#13;
crop-specific "production" departments at headquarters (horticulture, viticulture, livestock, grains,&#13;
agroprocessing, etc.), and MAF's regional offices. They have continued to see it as their mandate to&#13;
"ensure production" of raw materials to support the large-scale agro-industrial complex. While these&#13;
central departments and regional offices have the technical capability of providing the core of an&#13;
agricultural extension service, the concept of a "client-responsive service" to recently established private&#13;
farmers, as well as restructured former collectives, has not yet evolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Agriculture Sector                                                                           9&#13;
1.25          MAF maintains a Land Office, whose task in the FSU period was to define land use and&#13;
cropping based on technical soil classifications, and to meet centrally planned production target&#13;
requirements, while ensuring that "appropriate use" was made of each soil type (i.e. without any economic&#13;
criteria).  This office is now charged with rural land reform and farm restructuring, but also views this&#13;
function within the old framework of "appropriate land use," rather than as the development of farm&#13;
entrepreneurship.&#13;
1.26          Regulatory functions in MAF are not well developed, and those that exist are inappropriate&#13;
for a market economy. The legislative basis for a market economy regulatory regime is inadequate, as&#13;
is MAF's technical capacity for quality control and testing to give credibility to any regulatory authority.&#13;
This will be a significant constraint to product certification requirements for exports to the EU.&#13;
1.27          The agricultural statistics system inherited from the FSU, has effectively collapsed, and&#13;
cannot provide reliable data on agricultural production, trade or other rural economic activity.&#13;
Consequently, MAF does not have the data base on which to develop agricultural sector policy and&#13;
analyses. Agricultural policy analyses of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute9 are significantly&#13;
constrained by this inadequacy of data.&#13;
1.28           The strength of the institutions in agriculture is the high level of agro-technical expertise&#13;
of the professional staff. For example, MAF's research institutes are well aware of the technologies&#13;
appropriate for competitive agriculture. Institutional strengthening is required to technically upgrade&#13;
facilities, and to introduce new approaches to research management and include considerations of&#13;
competitiveness and financial viability (e.g. farm management and agricultural economics) into previously&#13;
agro-technical decision making. This mix of technical strength and the need for a market re-orientation&#13;
is typical for all the agricultural institutions.&#13;
1.29           GOM is questioning the appropriateness of the structure and functions of MAF for a rural&#13;
sector in transition. It is also concerned with achieving further public service downsizing, and increasing&#13;
its cost-effectiveness. GOM has requested the Bank's assistance to mobilize donor assistance for a study&#13;
of the appropriate functions and structure of the overall agricultural administration, and the future role of&#13;
government in the sector. These efforts to reconsider the role of MAF and plan for its new functions and&#13;
structure were initiated in early 1996.&#13;

II. THE AGRICULTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. GOM's Agriculture Investment Strategy&#13;
2.1           To initiate and sustain agriculture-led growth, the basis for agriculture should shift over&#13;
the medium-term to reflect Moldova's comparative advantages -- specialized high-value horticulture and&#13;
viticulture products.' Bulk commodity crops (e.g. grains, livestock products, and potatoes) would&#13;
generally be reduced to supplying only the domestic market. This strategy presumes high production&#13;
efficiency, and reliable production. It will require new high yield seeds and planting materials, irrigation&#13;
investments as safeguards against drought, and investments in research and development of other&#13;
production-intensifying technologies. Efficient production of high value crops can best be achieved by&#13;
maximizing individual incentives. This is achievable though a number of organizational means, including&#13;
smaller scale farming ventures (family and limited partnerships), various forms of cooperation in&#13;
machinery services, marketing and credit, and the application of new production technologies.&#13;
2.2           This agricultural markets-led, but technology-determined, medium-term strategy requires&#13;
development, expansion and improvements in a set of critical inputs, where the absence of any one of&#13;
them could jeopardize the entire strategy. These are:&#13;
*      the sector and general policy environment encouraging individuals' on- and off-farm and&#13;
off-farm rural entrepreneurship&#13;
*      technology development and transfer -- the agricultural knowledge system&#13;
*      land reform and farm restructuring&#13;
*      agro-enterprise development&#13;
*      rural finance&#13;
*      agricultural marketing (domestic and export) system&#13;
*      supporting rural infrastructure&#13;
*      the sector public administration and regulatory framework&#13;
Both GOM's sector policy reforms, and the planned Bank's general country assistance strategy and sector-&#13;
investment program (paras 2.4 et seq.), are based on this medium terrn strategy, with the promotion of,&#13;
and transformations in, all the above critical elements.&#13;
2.3           GOM and the Bank have agreed that the short- and medium-term focus for agricultural&#13;
development should be:&#13;
In the short term:&#13;
*      to achieve a rapid economic impact through increased export earnings and improved&#13;
production efficiency and product quality to meet target export market requirements;&#13;
*      to promote private ownership of rural land and to transform land into a "commodity"&#13;
much like any other input into agricultural production, and therefore to develop the rural&#13;
land title registration and transfer systems to promote rural land markets;&#13;
*      to provide support for key export product improvements (wine and wine-grapes, fruit and&#13;
vegetables);&#13;
*      to reduce post-harvest losses and costs through improved on-farm storage and other post-&#13;
harvest facilities to ensure quality maintenance; and&#13;
*      to deepen the market liberalization reforms (e.g. following from the de-monopolization&#13;
and privatization pursued under the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL)) to strengthen&#13;

private sector agro-processing, trading and financing, to ensure increased price&#13;
competition for inputs and produce.&#13;
In the medium term:&#13;
*       to support the deepening of rural land reform  and farm restructuring;&#13;
*       to support rural enterprise development;&#13;
*       to deepen the competitive impact of the agro-processing privatization and restructuring;&#13;
*       to improve the provision of rural financial, and other farming and rural services;&#13;
*       to reduce risk in agricultural production (primarily drought) through the expansion and&#13;
modernization of the irrigation systems;2&#13;
*       to strengthen human resources skills; and&#13;
*       to strengthen existing, and develop new agricultural and rural sector institutions (both&#13;
public and private).&#13;
2.4             Sector Institutions and Services:  The agriculture sector's progress also requires a&#13;
transformation in its institutions and the establishment of new public and private sector agricultural&#13;
institutions and services attuned to the market economy. This would also require support to improve&#13;
public sector infrastructure and services:&#13;
*       physical infrastructure (e.g. improvements in irrigation, rural roads, rural electrification&#13;
telecommunications, and rural water supplies);&#13;
*       agricultural technology  (e.g prioritization  and rationalization of the public-sector&#13;
agriculture research system, the development of private sector funding and participation&#13;
in agriculture research);&#13;
*       rural financial services (e.g. rural savings mobilization, rural lending and banking&#13;
services, crop insurance, loan guarantee schemes, micro-credit, entrepreneurship financing,&#13;
etc.);&#13;
*       public  information  and  knowledge  services (e.g. agricultural extension, market&#13;
information, tertiary and technical education, agricultural research);&#13;
*       policy, regulation and public administration (e.g. overall functions and staffing of&#13;
MAF; grains' strategic stocks policy;3 the wine sector development strategy; food quality&#13;
standards and inspection; environment standards for agriculture and agro-processing&#13;
activities; land use, soil and water conservation; land ownership and long term lease laws;&#13;
collateral laws, etc.); and&#13;
*       other public services (e.g. the development of the rural land market with complementary&#13;
government rural services for rural land-title registration and transfer services; legal&#13;
reforms particularly for a variety of farming-related associations,4 the commercial code,&#13;
real estate law, and anti-trust law).&#13;
2       and with appropriate financial instruments e.g. crop insurance, loan guarantee schemes, etc.&#13;
3        lThis policy study was agreed with the Bank during the negotiations for the first SAL, as a complement to the reforns and&#13;
privatization of the state grain monopoly, "Cereale". It is now planned for 1996 with the assistance of FAO.&#13;
4       providing the legal foundations for a range of for-profit and not-for-profit associations for the purposes of mutual&#13;
assistance, entrepreneurial activities, services, etc. [e.g. a revision of the (soviet) cooperatives law to permit service cooperatives&#13;
(marketing, credit etc.), legislation to govem farming and other types of partnerships, etc.l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                                  Chapter II&#13;
2.5           Support for the transformation of the Agricultural Knowledge System: with the key&#13;
role of the research system in the technology-led strategy, there are a number of steps that would need&#13;
to be followed to ensure the transformation of the research, education and extension systems corresponds&#13;
to the needs of sector operations and opportunities in an open market economy. These four stages are:&#13;
i)    initial "fire fighting" to preserve the basic research and intellectual assets against further&#13;
deterioration (i.e. the minimal budget funding currently provided by GOM);&#13;
ii)    targeted high priority selected investments for economically critical export crops'&#13;
research, which are clearly independent of the outcome of the conclusions of the review&#13;
of the system (e.g. this first project's investments in strategic technology transfers for&#13;
wine and horticulture are a part of this strategy);&#13;
iii)   review of the system and detennination of priorities, amalgamation, integration, cost&#13;
savings and the overall future agro-technology directions, and the corresponding&#13;
development of the overall agricultural "knowledge system" (this would be supported, in&#13;
part, with technical assistance funded under this project); and&#13;
iv)    implementation of and investments in, the rationalized knowledge system.&#13;
B. Country Assistance Strategy Context&#13;
2.6           The Bank's objective in its assistance program to Moldova is focused on support for the&#13;
rapid adjustment of the economy to the severe extemal shocks recently experienced, in order to promote&#13;
recovery to sustainable growth. Given, the small size of Moldova's domestic market and Moldova's&#13;
dependency on imported energy, the strategy to achieve economic growth must focus on sustainable export&#13;
development with necessary immediate improvements in efficiency (including reductions in energy&#13;
consumption, etc.) and quality. Moldova's principal exports are agricultural, requiring that this sector will&#13;
not only have to lead the export growth strategy, but also sustain growth in export earnings in the&#13;
medium-term. To achieve this, future agricultural development will require increases in productivity and&#13;
efficiency, re-orientation of production to meet new markets' demands, and acceleration of the post-&#13;
privatization market-orientation and efficiency adjustments of the agro-enterprises, and in primary&#13;
production on the joint-stock and the privatized farms. This enterprise and farming adjustment may well&#13;
involve reductions in the labor force. New employment creation and an adequate social safety net for the&#13;
unemployed are priorities to ensure a manageable transition.&#13;
2.7           Assistance to Agriculture: The Bank proposes, because of the centrality of agriculture to&#13;
Moldova's economic progress, to support the sector with a series of three loans over the next three to four&#13;
year period (paras 2.11 et seq.). The objective of the Bank's proposed agricultural investment program&#13;
in Moldova is the strengthening of the rural economy through support for:&#13;
a major shift in sector efficiency through:&#13;
(i)    promotion of private property and related rural entrepreneurship through rural&#13;
land reform and farm restructuring;&#13;
(ii)    promotion of new on-farm production methods and systems, to complement rural&#13;
land reform and farm restructuring;&#13;
(iii)  improvement in post-privatization development of agro-enterprises, and expansion&#13;
of new entrants;&#13;
(iv)   the development and transfer of new technologies into the sector;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Agriculture Sector Investment Program                                                     13&#13;
*      the improvement in the quality of products from farms and agro-processors;&#13;
*      promotion of non-farm rural entrepreneurship;&#13;
*      the development of effective export marketing systems for Moldova's agricultural&#13;
products;&#13;
*      the reform and strengthening of the rural finance delivery systems;&#13;
*      the strengthening of the sector's human resources and institutions, particularly the&#13;
agricultural knowledge system.&#13;
The proposed multi-loan agriculture investment program is designed to address these objectives in a&#13;
flexible manner, to enable the Bank to: (i) respond to emerging needs of the sector, consistent with the&#13;
impact of the macro-economic reform program; and (ii) provide support for systematic sector reforms and&#13;
complementary public sector investments with appropriate timing.&#13;
2.8           The first critical element is establishing the basis for rural entrepreneurship and risk taking.&#13;
This requires ownership of private property. For the agriculture sector this implies a deep rural land&#13;
reform and farm restructuring, with personal decision making and risk taking now taking the lead over&#13;
collective management of state property. The Bank has indicated to the Government that progress in rural&#13;
land reform is a critical element in any reform strategy for the macro-economy and the rural sector.&#13;
Dialogue is continuous with GOM on land reformn policy. The Bank will not proceed with the next phase&#13;
of the proposed agricultural lending program (paras 2.11 et seq.) without a substantive progress in land&#13;
reform, land ownership and farm restructuring. The Bank would utilize the proposed second Structural&#13;
Adjustment Loan, as well as policy studies financed under this project to assist GOM to advance this&#13;
reform.&#13;
2.9           The second critical element is the expansion of competitive production and processing.&#13;
This will depend on the expansion of market-based financing of rural activities, including working capital&#13;
and investment funds for both farmers (seasonal requirements for inputs and on-farm investments), and&#13;
for agri-businesses (e.g for input suppliers, product trading, storage, and processing). The rural financial&#13;
system will need to be reformed to deliver non-subsidized lending to a fast expanding client base of small&#13;
farmer production, and non-state agro-processors and traders. Financial resources will require&#13;
augmentation. This will be the focus of the proposed second loan to the Agriculture sector. This export-&#13;
market led strategy also requires attention to marketing, systems and institutions, primarily in the private&#13;
sector, as well as public sector support for effective export market expansion.&#13;
2.10          The effective roles of markets and entrepreneurs in agriculture are still limited by a&#13;
number of factors. Price liberalization has not been a sufficient policy intervention, as in itself it has not&#13;
resulted in market and competitive forces that provide efficient-pressures for sector restructuring. Residual&#13;
structural rigidities, both in the general economy and in the rural sectors, now need to be addressed. Thus,&#13;
to achieve the overall objective of agricultural exports-led economic growth requires attention to a number&#13;
of critical areas, all of which are necessary, but not sufficient on their own to achieve the broader&#13;
economic objectives. Table 2.1 sets out the critical areas and the elements of the agricultural sector&#13;
assistance strategy that would provide support to strengthening the rural economy as well as contributing&#13;
&#13;

investment project in the agricultural sector (see also Complementary Donor Assistance-- Box 2.2).&#13;

C. The Agriculture Investment Program Concept&#13;
2.11           This First Agricultural Project begins a proposed series of three Bank-supported&#13;
investmnents. The subsequent loans are under preparation and would commence implementation in the next&#13;
one to two years. Recognizing the agricultural sector policy reforns undertaken by GOM to date, the&#13;
proposal to fund this first project nevertheless is in advance of further policy changes and the reforms that&#13;
the Bank sees as necessary for sector progress (Box 2.1). The feasibility of implementation of the&#13;
components is neutral to land reform policy. Some components are designed to further advance general&#13;
sector policy development and reform. Initiating the Bank's agricultural sector investment program at this&#13;
stage of Moldova's sector transformation is designed to provide critical support and to encourage the&#13;
process of further sector reform.&#13;
2.12           This strategy also recognizes that in Moldova, as a democracy, the necessary public&#13;
consensus on some of the reform measures may be difficult to attain in the short run. Thus, it will be&#13;
essential to ensure that the sector economic environment becomes conducive to both the political and&#13;
economic risk-taking that some of these future reforms demand. The Bank's funding preconditions for&#13;
the proposed subsequent projects in the agriculture sector will be based on:&#13;
the evolution of GOM's sector policy reforms, in particular significaint progress on land&#13;
reform, farm  restructuring and the expansion of private rural land ownership by&#13;
cultivators;&#13;

project components.&#13;
Box 2.1: Agricultural Sector Policy Reforms&#13;
Private Property&#13;
Modification of the Land Code to re-establish individual exit rights from the collectives, to reduce the&#13;
confiscatory features of the 1995 Land Code amendments, and a substantially increased flexibility in&#13;
farm restructuring options.&#13;
Clarification in the Land Code of agricultural land ownership, lease provisions, and establishment of&#13;
lessor and lessee rights.&#13;
New legal provisions to permit farmers a choice from a variety of legally recognized associations which&#13;
they could utilize to achieve some economies of scale in farming-related services and production, and&#13;
as alternatives to the present ex-collective structures.&#13;
Legal and regulatory clarification of the farm restructuring process to ensure equitable valuation and&#13;
distribution of land, farm assets, and debts, among the designated beneficiaries, with legal provision for&#13;
appeal and arbitration by individual beneficiaries.&#13;
Clarification of the status of the ex-kolkhozes' and ex-sovkhozes' pension obligations to working and&#13;
retired members, and former members.&#13;
Trade and Rural Entrepreneurship&#13;
Deepening of the impact of the liberalization initiated under the SAL (with the de-monopolization and&#13;
privatization of agricultural input supplies, the grain system, agricultural trade, and in agro-processing)&#13;
with policies, for example, to ensure competition, to encourage the emergence of small- and medium-&#13;
scale operators, etc.&#13;
Revisiting the export licensing and regulatory regijne to ensure full international trade liberalization.&#13;
Implemnentation of a market-oriented national grains policy.*&#13;
Deepening of the post-privatization de-monopolization of rural and agricultural services.&#13;
Policy measures to enforce agro-enterprise payment discipline, reduce inter-enterprise debt and speed-up&#13;
post-privatization financial restructuring.&#13;
The rural financing system would not be distorted though the granting of preferential credits to the large&#13;
scale processors, ex-collective farms, and ex-state trading companies, nor the provision of other&#13;
favorable positions to the agricultural sector (debt forgiveness, restrictions on the provisions of the&#13;
bankruptcy code, etc.)&#13;
*       lThis Policy framework will be developed during 1996 with the assistance of FAO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                                  Chapter II&#13;
2.13          Macro-economic  and  sector policy  underpinning.    Under the  first SAL,&#13;
and following the policy reform recommendations of the Bank's Agriculture Sector Review,5 GOM began&#13;
the implementation of a number of agricultur,.-sector specific reforms. These reformns complement the&#13;
Agriculture Investment Program. The reforms included the de-monopolization and privatization of the&#13;
major agricultural services state-owned enterprises (the state trading houses in grains and agro-chemicals),&#13;
privatization of the agro-processing complexes, and the liberalization of the grain trade. The general&#13;
provisions of the SAL that impact on the sector are: the removal of price and margin controls and export&#13;
licensing; the reduction of the import tariffs; and the expansion of the industry privatization. The latter&#13;
activity had a direct positive impact on the farning sector through the privatization of the agro-processors,&#13;
and on the agro-marketing outlets through the small-scale privatization program, by ensuring that these&#13;
enterprises, post-privatization, and the farming enterprises, improved their management. With the SAL-&#13;
initiated sector policy reform as an underpinning, this first loan to the agriculture sector can concentrate&#13;
on priority sector investments.&#13;
2.14          Once the markets and competition begin to operate and provide the incentive signals to&#13;
producers and processors, the basis for agriculture is expected to shift to reflect Moldova's comparative&#13;
advantages in specific crops, i.e. into specialized, high-value horticulture and viticulture products as well&#13;
as of sugar.6 Bulk commodity crop volumes would generally be reduced to supplying only the domestic&#13;
market. The large livestock industry has already undergone a substantial downsizing, and in the future&#13;
will be reduced to domestic supplies with only limited regional exports.&#13;
2.15          In this context, the proposed First Agricultural Project concentrates on supporting&#13;
agricultural research for key export commodities, both established and emerging, as well as the related&#13;
research institutions' farner-outreach programs; promoting agro-enterprise restructuring and investment&#13;
planning; and assisting GOM on sectoral strategic planning, analysis of sector reforms, and the preparation&#13;
of further public investments for the sector. The choice of agricultural research as the first funding&#13;
priority for the sector reflects both the critical nature of technology transfers and development to the future&#13;
of the sector, and also the necessity to commence there activities early in the process because of the long&#13;
gestation times. Support for agro-processors post-privatization restructuring (financing as well as debt&#13;
work-out arrangements) would be available under the Private Sector Development Project (PSDP),'&#13;
complemented by technical assistance for agro-enterprise management training funded under this project.&#13;
2.16          Future Sector Policy Development: However, because of the absence of significant&#13;
progress in land reform and farm restructuring, the investment components of this first loan were limited&#13;
to activities not dependent, in the short-term, on the success of land reformn policy or other needed sector&#13;
policy reforms (Box 2. 1). Even if the land reform were not to be adequate over the next five to ten years,&#13;
the expected production and quality enhancing benefits of the first project would be realized on collective&#13;
farms, albeit not to the same extent as in private fanning. As the economic returns (Chapter 5) are high&#13;
with minimum growth assumptions, there is a high confidence factor of adequate returns to the economy&#13;
even under this "inadequate land reform" scenario.&#13;

The Agriculture Sector Investment Program                                                           17&#13;
2.17           Nevertheless, to proceed beyond this first Project with the proposed second and third&#13;
operations under the planned Agriculture Investment Program, requires as a pre-condition further reforms&#13;
and progress during the next twelve to eighteen month period. During the Agriculture Investment Program&#13;
preparation period, including during preparation of the second SAL, agreement would be sought on these&#13;
issues with GOM. Some components are being considered for incorporation in the reform program to be&#13;
supported under the proposed second SAL. The development of policy and operational options for these&#13;
areas of reform would be supported through technical assistance in this first loan, and possibly also&#13;
through bilateral assistance.&#13;
2.18           GOM  has requested that the proposed Second Agriculture Project focus on farm&#13;
production support, rural entrepreneurship, farming services, and agro-processing development. This the&#13;
Govemment proposes to achieve through a rural financing facility. The proposed Third Agricultural&#13;
Project would focus on selected rural water supply and irrigation schemes. The latter would reduce the&#13;
risk of drought impact (occurring in varying degrees of severity 6-7 in every 10 years in southem&#13;
Moldova), thereby stabilizing export and domestic food supplies. The preparation process for this loan&#13;
would establish a national water policy, and the related environment safeguards for the expansion of the&#13;
irrigation system.&#13;
2.19           Complementary sectoral assistance activities: The Agriculture Investment Programn is&#13;
designed to be integrated with other donor and multi-lateral institutions programs (Box 2.2), as well as&#13;
the Bank's lending progran in associated sectors (para 2.10). There is close coordination with the&#13;
EU (Tacis), IEFAD, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the&#13;
bilateral donors.&#13;
Box 2.2: Complementary Assistance&#13;
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is active with complementary&#13;
investments in Moldova, including a Wine Export Promotion Project, and a credit line for industry delivered&#13;
through the banking sector. An investment in the food wholesale marketing system is under preparation.&#13;
EU (Tacis), in its agriculture sector support, has been active in the rationalization of the livestock sector;&#13;
agricultural exports promotion, with a pilot program for agricultural extension and farmers' organizations, and&#13;
will provide technical assistance in their 1996 program for rural credit systems development, the seeds system,&#13;
and domestic market information. EU (Tacis) has agreed to coordinate its agricultural technical assistance to&#13;
complement the Bank's and EBRD's proposed rural sector lending programs.&#13;
The International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the Food and Agricultural&#13;
Organization of the United Nations (FAO): Moldova has recently applied to join IFAD and FAO. The&#13;
Bank's efforts at donor coordination have resulted in IFAD's agreement to prepare a parallel rural credit&#13;
project complementary to the first Project, and FAO's agreement to provide both preparation assistance for&#13;
the future projects, and sector policy studies (e.g grain policy).&#13;
Bilateral Donors: contributors of technical assistance in agriculture are Belgium, Canada, France,&#13;
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA.** Much of this assistance has been&#13;
coordinated with the Bank's investment planning.&#13;
*      either directly or through the Bank-administered national Consultant Trust Fund&#13;
in particular through a US-based NGO, VOCA, whose field assistance to farming communitics, and technical assistance to&#13;
the research establishment, has provided a significant contribution to this project's preparation.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                              Chapter II&#13;
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.20         This project, and the Agriculture Investment Program, are both consistent with the Bank's&#13;
overall assistance strategy for Moldova, and the sector development strategy recommended in the&#13;
Agriculture Sector Review. This strategy foresees a transformed, privatized agricultural sector leading&#13;
future economic growth. This Project's focus on technology transfer (Chapter 3) takes a short-to-medium&#13;
term view of the production transformation and the changes in competitiveness required to achieve&#13;
agricultural export growth. Immediate financing needs for agro-processing enterprises to achieve their&#13;
specific export targets would be financed under the PSDP. Farmers' on-farm investment requirements will&#13;
be funded through the IFAD-supported credit line financed in parallel to this Project, and the proposed&#13;
second Agriculture Project.&#13;
2.21         At the 1995 Consultative Group meeting, both the Bank and other donors indicated a&#13;
strong sensitivity to policy issues in the rural sector, in particular the early 1995 changes in land reform&#13;
policy. Donor support for Moldova in general, and for rural sector activities, requires that both the Bank's&#13;
and GOM's actions are recognized as furthering the sector reforms, including land reforrn and farm&#13;
restructuring, and ensuring individuals' rights to equitable access to land and other farming assets.&#13;
2.22         Reforms implemented by GOM, and supported through the SAL, require deepening, and&#13;
further support though sector-specific investments. Reform support would be provided through this&#13;
project's Technical Assistance, as well as the proposed second SAL. Complementary investments through&#13;
this first project in agriculture would be a method to bolster GOM's confidence that the agriculture sector&#13;
will be able to withstand, and rebound from, the perceived shocks of rural land reform. Complementary&#13;
future investment support would include: improvement of public sector infrastructure - physical (e.g.&#13;
irrigation); public information and services (e.g. agricultural extension, market information, land titles);&#13;
and for public domain technologies (e.g. agricultural research, education and extension). The proposed&#13;
Agriculture Investment Progran would help achieve this. GOM's complementary policy and strategy&#13;
development is strengthened through the Bank's continuing policy dialogue and through project&#13;
development, ownership and preparation of the agriculture investment program.&#13;
E. Lessons from Past Bank Experience&#13;
2.23         The Agriculture Investment Program would support project components where the Bank&#13;
has had many years of experience (e.g. research, agricultural education, agricultural extension, land reform,&#13;
irrigation and rural infrastructure, rural financial institutions, etc.), as well as components where experience&#13;
is relatively recent (e.g. management of the agriculture sector's transition to a market economy, informal&#13;
credit systems, farm restructuring). The Bank's experience in the necessity to develop ownership with&#13;
the government and administration on the one hand, and to involve the beneficiaries - in this case farmers,&#13;
and research and planning personnel -- on the other, has guided the design and the flexibility of the&#13;
proposed approach. Legitimate stakeholder and Parliamentary concerns would need to be accommodated.&#13;
Thus, the implementation program is designed to be able to respond flexibly to these realities in a&#13;

economic policies that accommodate political reality.&#13;
2.24          Experience from the completed Drought Emergency Loan' and the Rehabilitation Loan&#13;
shows that for clearly defined objectives, GOM can bring together the administrative forces for successful&#13;
implementation within an agreed timetable. These projects also demonstrated the importance of Technical&#13;
Assistance, especially to be able to manage procurement and disbursements in a manner satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank. This Technical Assistance has been maintained in the design of the projects, while at the same&#13;
time GOM is being urged to "institutionalize" these skills through both training of local experts, and the&#13;
establishment of a satisfactory employment structure to maintain their services post-training.&#13;
2.25          Recent experience from the first SAL and the Pre-Export Guarantee Facility, indicate that&#13;
both Government and Bank efforts will need to focus on:&#13;
(a)    ensuring in-depth implementation of reform and restructuring commitments in accordance&#13;
with agreed timetables;&#13;
(b)    inter-Ministerial coordination and adequate information flows to all stakeholders on&#13;
critical decisions;&#13;
(c)    ensuring up-front efforts to build consensus on critical issues and changes, especially those&#13;
that result in significant shifts in centers of power and influence;&#13;
(d)    ensuring timely Government decision-making on relatively minor, but nevertheless&#13;
essential, procedural and administrative matters; and&#13;
(e)    ensuring adequate local budget commitments and allocation of counterpart funds to&#13;
Project accounts.&#13;

HI. THE FIRST AGRICULTURE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
3.1           Growth and sustained recovery of Moldova's economy will greatly depend on agricultural&#13;
exports. The Government of Moldova seeks, through utilizing this Project and the planned future projects,&#13;
to strengthen the agriculture sector to promote agricultural exports, to increase agricultural incomes of the&#13;
rural population, and to strengthen sector institutions. Specifically, this first Project's objectives are to:&#13;
*      upgrade and improve the effectiveness of key agricultural research programs on priority export&#13;
crops and products;&#13;
*      strengthen institutions in priority areas: the agricultural knowledge system; product quality&#13;
regulatory functions; management in the post-privatized agro-processing sector;&#13;
*      develop capabilities to prepare sector investments and develop sector policy; and&#13;
*      develop project management and implementation capacity for the agriculture investment program.&#13;

Box 3.1 Strengthening Rural Finance&#13;
With the transformation of the farming system, the number of borrowers for on-farm credits is&#13;
increasing from the formerly 3,600 large cooperative complexes, to a potential client base of over&#13;
one million private farmers. The banking system is not designed to service this number of new&#13;
clients, and the small-loan portfolio management this will require. With the privatization of the&#13;
banking sector, the expansion of local resource mobilization by the banks, and the expected&#13;
dominance of agriculture in the national economy, a number of banks have indicated that they wish&#13;
to develop their rural lending capacity. At the same time, the newly emerging independent farmers&#13;
will need assistance to develop their own borrowing capabilities.&#13;
Both the privatized large scale agro-processors and new smaller scale (some on-farm)&#13;
agro-processing could be financed from the credit lines financed by EBRD and under the Bank's&#13;
PSD Project. Farning investment and seasonal credit resources will be augmented by a proposed&#13;
IFAD rural credit line planned for delivery to GOM in parallel with this Project. IFAD proposes,&#13;
in parallel to this Project, to finance a rural credit line of about $4 million, delivered through an&#13;
IFAD-selected participating financial institution (PFI). IFAD has still to determine which PFI to&#13;
utilize.&#13;
In keeping with IFAD's mandate of assisting the under-privileged of its member countries, the credit&#13;
would be directed to small farmers to enhance their income potential. These farmers would have&#13;
exited from former collectives either individually or in organized groups. Currently, these farmers&#13;
are facing difficulties procuring inputs and credit, and appear relatively disadvantaged, having&#13;
limited land, mechanical resources, and services from the formal agricultural services systems.&#13;
As collateral is a major issue, IFAD's proposed credit program would extend credit to farmers on&#13;
ajoint-and-several-liability basis, provided the farmers agree to come together in informal service&#13;
organizations that would arrange input supplies, tractor services and credit. This credit line will&#13;
therefore require that legislation be passed to permit the establishment of Service Cooperatives.&#13;
EU (Tacis) plans to finance technical assistance to strengthen the rural credit system, and the&#13;
potential beneficiaries capacities to access credit. Tacis' assistance will be: (a) to the IFAD-selected&#13;
PFI for capacity improvement and staff training in rural lending operations; (b) for assistance to&#13;
farmers' organizations with rural finance mobilization; and (c) to assess the PFI's computerization&#13;
requirements for rural branches, village offices and central offices' credit control units, with possible&#13;
introduction of FAO's "Microbanker" computerized system for rural banks.&#13;
The Government has requested that the second Bank project provide support for the further&#13;
development of rural financial services; the financing of medium-term credit facilities for all rural&#13;
and agriculture-related entrepreneurship, including off-farm enterprises; and support for the&#13;
establishment of a rural loan guarantee fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The First Agriculture Project                                                            23&#13;
Institutional Strengthening (US$1.0 million)&#13;
3.7           Studies and Training (US$0.4 million): The project would finance study trips abroad,&#13;
and possibly visits by selected trainers as complements for the following two activities:&#13;
a)     The Agriculture Knowledge Systems Study: With the transformation of the agriculture&#13;
sector to operations under the open market, the re-orientation of research priorities has&#13;
become essential. The large multi-institute system inherited from the Soviet Union is not&#13;
suitable for the sector or the resources in Moldova. Issues of subject-matter priorities,&#13;
even the methods of priority setting, the interaction with producers and the academic&#13;
community, growers' outreach programs, rational budget allocations, etc., have now&#13;
become priorities. Similarly, the tertiary agricultural education, technical education and&#13;
the extension service, need to be re-oriented to the market economy, to commercial&#13;
production. At negotiations, Government assured the Bank that it would form a national&#13;
committee that would study similar systems in relevant countries to provide an integrated&#13;
national strategy for the agricultural knowledge system. Cost of travel and possible&#13;
external advisors would be covered under the loan. The Government during&#13;
implementation of the study may wish the assistance of external advisors which would be&#13;
selected under the Bank's Guidelines for Consulting Services (para. 6.1(a)).&#13;
b)     Agro-industries Management and Staff Training: This technical assistance complements&#13;
the investment and working capital credit line available to all of Moldova's privatized&#13;
industry from the PSDP (see also Box 3.1 -- Strengthening Rural Finance). The&#13;
technical assistance would provide management and technical training, to qualified&#13;
individual managers and staff of agro-enterprises, through study trips and work experience&#13;
overseas with companies utilizing relevant processing technologies, with similar products,&#13;
and of relevant operational size. At Negotiations, the Government presented draft&#13;
selection criteriafor training candidates (para. 6.1(b)).&#13;
3.8           Grains Regulatory Laboratories (US$0.6 million).  With the de-monopolization and&#13;
privatization of the (state-owned) cereals-sector complex, MAF's regulatory control of grain imports and&#13;
local grain processing (e.g. animal feeds, bread-flour and pastas) should be improved. This sub-&#13;
component would finance the import of equipment to modernize and increase the capacity of the grains&#13;
regulatory laboratories recently transferred to MAF.&#13;
Project Preparation and Policy Development (US$0.3 million)&#13;
3.9           This component would finance sector policy analysis, and the preparation of the next two&#13;
proposed loans in the Bank's lending program for the sector. The major elements of the second project,&#13;
from which the final selection would be made, are outlined in para. 2.18. The preparation of the&#13;
components for the second loan would be made through a consultative and participatory approach now&#13;
being instituted by GOM under the Project Preparation Committee (PPC -- Chapter 4). Each of the&#13;
project components would require both local and international technical inputs for final design, which this&#13;
would be funded under this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                                                        Chapter III&#13;
3.10           For the third project -- the irrigation investments -- a PHRD grant application has been&#13;
approved. The engineering design capacity of AcvaProjekt, the irrigation engineering institute under Apele&#13;
Moldova,3 would be enhanced with the provision of engineering computer workstations and peripheralk,&#13;
and staff training on computer-aided design (US$0.1 million).&#13;
3.11           With the expected changes in land reform, a number of high priority policy aspects need&#13;
to be addressed, and assistance with the following tasks would be funded under this component:&#13;
*      development of the draft laws for Farm  Restructuring, Service Cooperatives, Law on&#13;
Farmland Collateral, Rural Land Policy, etc.;&#13;
*      design of rural land title registration systems, in support of the proposed Land Cadastre&#13;
Project; and&#13;
*      case studies of actual experience of privatized farms and restructured former collective&#13;
farns, to assess lessons learned and best practices to be followed.&#13;
Project Management (US$0.67 million)&#13;
3.12           In preparation for the management of the proposed three investment projects, this Project&#13;
would fund the establishment and strengthening of project management and project preparation&#13;
capabilities, and the operations of the Project Management Committee and the Project Preparation&#13;
Committee (PMC and PPC -- Chapter 4), over a period of four years, with loan financing for:&#13;
i)     local staff and technical assistance for training of PMC staff in project management,&#13;
accounting, auditing, etc.; and the PMC, PPC, MAF and implementing agencies' staff, in&#13;
monitoring and evaluation (particularly economic and development impact assessment of&#13;
the Project), and participatory approaches to project preparation;&#13;
ii)    the costs of the services of international consulting services for a Procurement Advisor&#13;
(Chapter 4), to both support the Project's and other Bank projects' procurement,4 and&#13;
provide training in procurement and disbursement; and&#13;
iii)    office equipment, suppliers and incremental operating costs for four years.&#13;
3.13           To ensure timely delivery of both policy reforms and project preparation for the overall&#13;
Bank funded Agriculture Investment Program, GOM requested to commence training activities, policy&#13;
studies, and procurement packages finalization activities ahead of project effectiveness utilizing a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF).&#13;
C. Project Costs&#13;
3.14           The total cost of the Project is US$18.5 million, of which the foreign exchange cost is&#13;
estimated at US$11.8 million, or 64% of the total costs. The Ministry of Finance will recommend to the&#13;
Cabinet at the time of loan approval, to exempt project imports from import duties and value added taxes.&#13;
3       the agency responsible for the preparation of the irrigation project -- Chapter 4&#13;
4      At Negotiations GOM agreed that this project would finance the first year costs of this Advisor to assist all Bank&#13;
projects financed from this project, while the proposed Energy project and other subsequent projects would each cover one year&#13;
of costs of this common service in future years.&#13;
&#13;

The First Agriculture Project                                                          25&#13;
Local costs -- including civil works and incremental operating costs -- will not be exempt from value&#13;
added taxes. The total cost of the Project (before value added taxes)' includes: US$14.3 million (76% of&#13;
total costs) in incremental investments and US$2.6 million (14% of total costs) in incremental operating&#13;
and maintenance costs, of which US$1.8 million (10% of total costs) are price and physical contingencies.&#13;

D. Project Financing&#13;
3.15         The proposed financing of the Project (including contingencies) is shown in Table 3.2.&#13;
The financing plan includes financing by the Government of investments (US$4.0 million) and by&#13;
Government and the Institutes for all value added taxes (about US$1.7 million). Self-financing by the&#13;
Research Institutes would total about US$3.7 million, about 20% of project costs, for incremental&#13;
operating costs and value added taxes. This would be sourced from sales of improved planting materials,&#13;
and, for NIVO, sale of wine. In addition, in the outer years, these institutes would have the ability for&#13;
firther capital and operating cost recovery through the sale of project-funded improved products. This&#13;
is estimated to recover about 30% to 40% of the capital investment costs (Table 5.1, para. 5.7). At&#13;
Negotiations, the Borrower agreed that, as a condition ofdisbursementfor the nurseries, NIVO and Codru&#13;
would have entered into cost recovery agreements with each of the wine and horticulture plant nurseries&#13;
being established under the project; and that these agreements would be satisfactory to the Bank (para.&#13;
6.3(a)).&#13;

3.16         At Negotiations, GOM informed the Bank that it had selected the single currency [US&#13;
dollar] variable rate option. An advance of US$500,000 has been provided to GOM from the PPF to&#13;
cover the initial pre-effectiveness cost of technical assistance and procurement planning assistance for the&#13;
PMC, as well as technical assistance to initiate some of the higher-priority studies, (which by their nature&#13;
will take a fairly long time to complete) for the project preparation for the proposed second project.&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
3.17         All goods, works and services to be financed from the loan proceeds would be procured&#13;
by government agencies in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits (January 1995) (the "Guidelines"), including amendments as of the loan signing date,&#13;
using the Bank standard bidding documents. Consulting Services would be procured in accordance with&#13;
the Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency (August 1981) (the "Consultants Guidelines"), including amendments as of the loan signing date.&#13;
This was agreed at negotiations (para. 6.1(c)). Standard bidding documents include: International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) for works, for goods, for computers6, and for textbooks.' The laws and&#13;
regulations governing local procurement procedures and practices in Moldova are being reviewed by the&#13;
Bank in order to establish whether local procedures are acceptable for Bank-financed contracts. A Country&#13;

Procurement Assessment Report for Moldova will not be prepared since there is no local public&#13;
procurement framework. However, the Bank is currently preparing a Procurement Strategy Note, which&#13;
will be completed during the course of FY96. A "General Procurement Notice" containing information&#13;
about bidding opportunities (for procurement on the basis of ICB) would be published in "Development&#13;
Business" in accordance with paras. 2.7 and 2.8 of the Bank Guidelines for Procurement in about May&#13;
1996. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3 below. Major procurement packages are&#13;

3.18         Equipment and Goods (US$9.6 million). As far as practicable, these would be packaged&#13;
in such a manner that all packages would be large enough to attract international competition and at the&#13;
same time would contain packages suitable for attracting small manufacturers. An estimated US$4.29&#13;
million equivalent of goods and equipment would be procured through International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB). Moldovan manufacturers competing for the contracts for the supply of goods procured&#13;
under ICB procedures would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the&#13;

prevailing custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided they can prove&#13;
to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes more&#13;
than 30 percent of locally procured labor, raw materials, and components. Limited International&#13;
Bidding (LIB) (US$3.39 million) would be used for packages of specialized equipment and goods' where&#13;
there are a limited number of manufacturers that would be qualified with acceptable quality for research&#13;
purposes. International Shopping (IS) (US$0.72 million), based on comparison of price quotations&#13;
obtained from at least three suppliers from two eligible countries, will be used for procurement of&#13;
specialized equipment, with individual packages limited to a maximum of US$300,000 each. This will&#13;
be restricted to computer hardware, laboratory, and other specialized equipment. National Shopping (NS)&#13;
($65,000) based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers, will be used for&#13;
procurement of computer accessories, and laboratory consumables estimated to cost less than US$20,000&#13;
per package. Procurement of goods through Direct Contracting (DC) (US$1.86 million) would be&#13;
restricted to computer software of a proprietary nature (US$90,000), laboratory equipment from original&#13;
suppliers where standardization with existing equipment is essential (US$170,000), and clonal and genetic&#13;
materials, where there would be only a number of acceptable sources of supply, but each for a particular&#13;
type of material (US$1.6 million in a number of packages).&#13;
3.19          Consultancy Services, Training and Studies (US$1.7 million): for consulting services&#13;
for project and policy planning studies, training for scientists and other staff, and for services to PMC,&#13;
would be awarded in accordance with the Consultants Guidelines through short-listing procedures.&#13;
Training is required in a number of recipient institutions, and management of the agro-processors, for very&#13;
technical subjects, and thus will be mostly procured from individual specialists in their technical fields,&#13;
or through sending the trainees on study tours. Each institution will be required, as a part of the project&#13;
initiation procedures to be initiated at the project launch, to provide their training program, and thus the&#13;
training specialists procurement schedule. These training programs would be submitted to the Bank for&#13;
prior approval. Most of the training will be conducted within the first year of the project, as it is related&#13;
to the utilization of goods and materials procured under the project.&#13;
3.20          Procurement Review. All contracts awarded through ICB, LIB and DC, and the contracts&#13;
for consultancy services valued in excess of US$100,000 for firms, and US$50,000 for individuals, would&#13;
be subject to prior Bank review. This limit would result in prior review of about 80 percent of total&#13;
procurement. All other contracts would be subject to ex-post review during the supervision of the Project&#13;
in accordance with the Guidelines. Also, terms of reference for all technical assistance and consultancy&#13;
contacts would be reviewed in advance by the Bank.&#13;
3.21          Procurement Plan and Monitoring. Procurement plans for major procurement packages&#13;
are presented in Annex 5. Procurement data would be collected and recorded by the PMC. The General&#13;
Procurement Notice would be published about July 1996. The Project Launch Workshop, including&#13;
attention to procurement, would be scheduled as close as is feasible to loan effectiveness. Under the&#13;
Project Preparation Facility, preparation of final bidding documents, and the finalization of the&#13;
procurement plan would be undertaken by the Procurement Advisor, hired under the PPF to services the&#13;
project. Procurement training of the PMC staff will also be undertaken by the procurement advisor, under&#13;
the PPF funding. Agreement was reached at Negotiations that, every quarter the PMC would prepare,&#13;
' for experimental wine and horticulture production, and for experimental drip and sprinkler irrigation systems, requiring&#13;
precise, replicable, monitorable performance&#13;

is 20% of the current amount of allocation to the Special Account. Expenditures for individual contracts&#13;
under US$150,000 for goods procured under IS, NS and DC' will be disbursed against Statements of&#13;
Expenditure certified by Ministry of Finance, on the basis of documentation provided by the PMC. The&#13;
PMC will ensure that all supporting documentation is adequately maintained and available for review at&#13;
the request of the Bank. Disbursements for all contracts over US$150,000' will be made against fully&#13;
documented withdrawal applications.&#13;

3.24         At Negotiations, agreement was reached on the terms and conditions for the establishment&#13;
and operation of a Special Account for the Project (para. 6.1(e)). To facilitate project implementation,&#13;
the Borrower would establish a Special Account in one of the major foreign commercial banks on terms&#13;
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's share of expenditures. The Authorized&#13;
Allocation would be US$ 1,000,000, representing about four months of average expenditures made through&#13;
the Special Account. During the early stages of the Project, the initial allocation to the Special Account&#13;
would be limited to US$500,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Loan have&#13;
reached the level of US$4,000,000, the initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation&#13;
of US$1,000,000 by submitting the relevant Application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment&#13;
of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn,&#13;
whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank&#13;
procedure, as described in the Disbursement Handbook (Chapter 6). Monthly bank statements of the&#13;
Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment&#13;
requests.&#13;
3.25         The Project is expected to disburse over four years (Table 3.5). This disbursement does&#13;
not follow a standard disbursement profile because Project funds are primarily expended on imported&#13;
goods and equipment, most of which would be procured early in the project period. Similarly, technical&#13;
assistance is intended mostly for project preparation and policy studies, necessary to prepare the second&#13;
and third projects. The technical assistance would therefore be expended mostly within the first twelve&#13;
months of the Project. Only a small portion of the technical assistance to the agro-processors and the&#13;
PMC assistance is expected to continue to be disbursed in the latter years. The estimated date for project&#13;
completion is June 2001.&#13;

G. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.26         Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower's records and accounts of the&#13;
Project, including the Special Account, for each fiscal year would be audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and furnished to the Bank within six months after the end of each year&#13;
(para 6.1(f)). The audit reports would contain separate opinions on: (a) compliance by implementing&#13;
agencies with relevant covenants of the Loan Agreement with the Bank; (b) the Statements of&#13;
Expenditures; and (c) the Special Account. The Bank-required audits would not cover either IFAD's&#13;
proposed loan, or possible donor funded activities, even if supervised by the Bank.&#13;
H. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.27         No significant negative environmental impacts are anticipated from this Project. The&#13;
Project was classified as category "B" because the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) component of the&#13;
Project is potentially environmental sensitive and will require environmental review. The proposed IPM&#13;
component would improve and expand the use of biological means to control pests in agriculture. The&#13;
assistance to improve pest forecasting methods and to the planned training center for sustainable&#13;
agricultural practices would lead to a reduction of the use of pesticides in Moldova. GOM would conduct&#13;
an ongoing environmental assessment of the impact of the IPM and pest forecasting programs under the&#13;
project, with reporting to the Bank and GOM's environmental agencies every six months, within the&#13;
framework of normal periodic reporting on project implementation to be provided by the PMC to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
1. Gender and Family Issues&#13;
3.28         The transition period has negatively affected a large part of the population. According&#13;
to a recent case study on Moldova,'" on average, female farm laborers receive lower wages than men.&#13;
Women have equal access to land shares and even outnumber men as land share holders. Men, however,&#13;
outnumber women as property share holders (e.g. they own more farm assets). This might be one of the&#13;
reasons why women make up only a small percentage of private farm owners/operators and are more&#13;
likely to remain on the cooperative farms. Recently, access to social services on cooperative farms has&#13;
declined, which negatively affects women with families more than men.&#13;
3.29        The need for a specific loan component to address gender issues was evaluated during&#13;
project preparation. It was not seen as necessary under this Project because the proposed investments&#13;
would indirectly benefit men and women to the same extent. More than in other countries, men and&#13;
women share an equal role in the rural sector in Moldova, including management responsibilities in large&#13;
farm organizations and agro-processing plants, as well as political leadership for rural municipalities.&#13;

J. Participation&#13;
3.30          The preparation of this Project involved stakeholders from beyond the staff of the research&#13;
institutes and other laboratories benefiting from the technology transfer. The implementation of the IPM&#13;
component, and the assistance to the farmers to access credit (from IFAD) would utilize local NGOs.&#13;
Assessment of the impact and progress of land reform was undertaken utilizing in-depth social assessment&#13;
surveys of farmers and rural administrators."&#13;
3.31          The preparation of the planned two future projects will be undertaken by GOM  in a&#13;
consultative manner with a range of stakeholders (Chapter 4). Donor funded technical assistance for these&#13;
activities will include the skills development for participatory planning.&#13;
K. Rural Poverty&#13;
3.32          This first Agriculture Project does not include components directly targeted at the poor.&#13;
Therefore, it has not been classified as a program of targeted intervention even though several components&#13;
of the Project would in the medium term benefit the rural poor. It supports the restructuring process of&#13;
agriculture by assisting the development of an integrated pest management strategy, and improving wine,&#13;
fruit and horticulture production. Even though this Project concentrates mainly on research, pilot&#13;
production technologies, and strengthening institutions in agriculture, it will help to reduce poverty in the&#13;
long run. Furthermore, the three planned agricultural projects should be seen as a consistent progran&#13;
aimed at promoting growth in the rural economy through the development of agriculture: this would&#13;
largely benefit the rural poor through the generation of opportunities for higher producer incomes, and&#13;
rural entrepreneurial opportunities.&#13;
3.33          The next two agricultural projects in the agricultural investment program could include&#13;
for example: support for land reform and farm restructuring; support for, and strengthening of rural&#13;
financial services; the development of small and medium scale rural entrepreneurship; the expansion and&#13;
upgrading of agro-processing and improvement of agro-export marketing services; rural water supply and&#13;
irrigation. All these components would benefit small farmers (most of whom at present are near or below&#13;
the poverty line). The proposed IFAD credit project would be specifically targeted to provide direct&#13;
access for private farmers and farmers working on their household plots to small-scale credit. These&#13;
farners currently have no access to any credit resources to purchase farm inputs, small machinery or&#13;
livestock through the original channels exclusively geared to financing the large collective farms. The&#13;
proposed irrigation and rural water supply project would also promote income generation in drought prone&#13;
rural areas, and this irrigation system is expected to benefit mostly smaller scale intensive family farming&#13;
(those presently with high poverty risk).&#13;

TV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
4.1           Sector policy development and investment planning, within the structure of the&#13;
Government is handled at the level of the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for that sector. This ensures&#13;
the necessary inter-ministerial coordination, consensus establishment across the government, and the&#13;
strategic dimension provided by the Cabinet of Ministers. GOM has therefore established a Project&#13;
Planning Committee (PPC -- para. 4.13) to manage the overall agriculture investment program to be&#13;
funded by the proposed series of Bank loans. The PPC is under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Prime&#13;
Minister in charge of the agriculture sector.&#13;
4.2          The project's investment implementation has been designed to fit within the regular&#13;
administrative structure of the Government and its related institutions. A centralized project unit (the&#13;
Project Management Committee -- PMC) has been established in MAF to provide administrative services,&#13;
overall financial controls over loan proceeds, and for reporting to the Bank. The authority for the&#13;
implementation of project investments would be vested with a Vice Minister of Agriculture, with the&#13;
Director of the Agricultural Research Department (ARD) in MAF as Project Manager, working through&#13;
the PMC to the implementing line agencies (para. 4.4).&#13;

C. Project Implementation Details&#13;
Project Management&#13;
4.4           The Proiect Management Committee (PMC):' The project and its individual components&#13;
would be carried out under the overall coordination and supervision of MAF.  MAF's Agricultural&#13;
Research Department (ARD) has been designated ex-officio Project Manager, and would be responsible&#13;
on behalf of GOM for implementing the investment components of the Project. The Project Manager&#13;
would be the principal day-to-day link between GOM and the Bank's project supervision. A Project&#13;
Management Committee (PMC) has been established under the chairmanship of a Vice Minister of&#13;
Agriculture, and with members: the Project Director, the heads of the Research Institutes (NIVO, Codru,&#13;
Porumbeni, Tevit and Selectsia) and the President of Apele Moldova. Prior to Negotiations, the Borrower&#13;
appointed the members of PMC and the Director of the ARD as Project Manager.&#13;
4.5           The Project Manager would be assisted by: an agricultural economist to introduce and&#13;
implement project monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system and to provide the focus for any policy study&#13;
coordination requested by the Project Preparation Committee (PPC, para. 4.13); an accountant, a&#13;
procurement assistant; an administrative assistant, and a bilingual correspondence secretary. It is planned&#13;
that the PMC would also be responsible for the implementation of the planned second and third Bank&#13;
projects in the agriculture sector. For procurement and disbursements, advisory services would be&#13;
contracted to international consultants to provide a Procurement Advisor to the Project. The appointment&#13;
of the principle PMC staff 2 and the Procurement Advisor, with qualifications and terms of reference&#13;
agreed with the Bank would be a condition of effectiveness (para. 6.2(a)).&#13;
4.6           The PMC would also receive international technical assistance to set up the administrative&#13;
and accounting requirements within the MAF and its beneficiary agencies, to design the Project's&#13;
Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E), and to train the PMC and MAF staff in M&amp;E. Through bilateral&#13;
assistance facilitated by the Bank, technical assistance will be provided to design and train staff in&#13;
participatory and consultative project preparation practices (paras 4.14 and 4.15).&#13;
Agro-technology Development and Transfer Component&#13;
4.7           The major items to be financed under the project -- the import of equipment for the&#13;
research institutes -- support the ongoing work programs of the beneficiary research institutes (NIVO,&#13;
Codru, Porumbeni, Tevit and Selectsia), all of which are legal sub-entities under MAF. Therefore, the&#13;
execution of these sub-components will be managed entirely by these Institutes in accordance with their&#13;
established research programs and coordinated with the Agriculture Research Department (ARD). The&#13;
PMC would provide the Institutes with procurement and disbursement services, and the PMC staff would&#13;
coordinate the Project's reporting requirements, and establish the economic impact M&amp;E programs with&#13;
each Institute. This will be facilitated by the Institutes' membership on the PMC (para. 4.4). The&#13;
installation and operation of the pilot drip irrigation components in both NIVO and Codru, and on-farm,&#13;
would be coordinated with, and, for irrigation engineering aspects, supervised by, Apele Moldova.&#13;

4.8           For the Integrated Pest Management sub-components, the PMC would: (i) coordinate,&#13;
through Selectsia, the project's support for field demonstration and training activities of the GOM's&#13;
ecologically sustainable farming program ("Moldagroeco"); and (ii) coordinate the laboratory and other&#13;
equipment supply for the benefiting laboratories in MAF and the Ministry of Health.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening Component&#13;
4.9           The Agricultural Knowledge System Study: GOM, through the PPC under the Deputy&#13;
Prime Minister of Agriculture, would appoint a commission to examine the future strategy for the&#13;
Agriculture Knowledge System, including travel to similar systems in transition, and the development of&#13;
their strategy recommendations. At Negotiations, the appointment of this study team, and the time frame&#13;
for this study was agreed (para. 6.1(a)).&#13;
4.10          Agro-industries Management and Staff Training:  this training program  would be&#13;
administered by the PMC. At Negotiations, a draft of the selection criteria for candidates was presented&#13;
to the Bank by the Borrower (para 6.1 (b)).&#13;
4.11          Equipment for the Grains Laboratory would be procured by the PMC on the basis of the&#13;
specifications provided by MAF's Grains Department, and with prior approval by the Bank. Training in&#13;
the use of the equipment would be included in the equipment supply contracts, but training for the&#13;
management and administration of laboratory testing for regulatory standards enforcement would be&#13;
funded separately by the project.&#13;
Project Preparation and Policy Development Component&#13;
4.12          Following the dialogue between GOM and the Bank, a Project Preparation Committee&#13;
(PPC) has been established to manage GOM's design input and decisions on the content of future Bank-&#13;
funded projects for the sector. The PPC is headed by the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the&#13;
agriculture sector (para. 4.1). The PPC will be active in developing sector policy, determining project&#13;
investment requirements and recommending priorities to the Cabinet of Ministers for the agriculture sector.&#13;
The PPC includes the Project Director, senior representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture, as well as&#13;
the Ministries of Finance and Economy, and the National Bank of Moldova. The Director General of&#13;
Apele Moldova would be included for deliberations related to the proposed third project for the irrigation&#13;
and rural water supply investment.&#13;
4.13          Project Preparation Teams. Detailed component investment plans for the next projects&#13;
would be prepared during the first 18 months of Project implementation. Each of these proposed&#13;
components has an interest group to be served. The responsible technical groups within the relevant&#13;
ministries, as well as beneficiaries' representatives, will be included in the team supervising and guiding&#13;
the technical preparation effort. The participants in these supervisory teams, and other participants, will&#13;
be determined at the time each preparation topic is selected by the PPC. The technical assistance to be&#13;
provided under this project for these activities will include the skills development for participatory&#13;
planning for these teams.&#13;
4.14          The Participatory Process. Both for ongoing project implementation and for the planning&#13;
of the Agriculture Investment Program, the MAF, through the PPC, will initiate a consultative and&#13;
participatory process of project planning. The objective is to provide the PPC with a range of inputs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                             Chapter IV&#13;
polling as wide a range of constituent's opinions as possible, and utilizing this consultative process to&#13;
build an understanding and ownership for the various progrns at field level. This group of stakeholders&#13;
would consist of representatives of the various Producers', Processors' and Agricultural Traders'&#13;
organizations, the Bankers' organization, agricultural academic and research organizations, rural and social&#13;
research organizations, and Parliamentarians active on agricultural and rural committees of Parliament.&#13;
Technical assistance, to be provided under bilateral assistance in parallel to this project, and facilitated by&#13;
the Bank's own staff, would be provided to assist the PPC to establish the participatory and consultative&#13;
norms for the effective use of such consultative groups.&#13;
D. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.15         The time-based implementation schedules for each of the Project components are provided&#13;
in Annex 1. Project critical activities are "front-loaded" in the first year with: (a) imports of major&#13;
equipment packages for research; and (b) technical assistance for project preparation and institutional&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
E. Reporting and Evaluation&#13;
4.16         The implementing line agencies responsible for various aspects of the Project would&#13;
prepare quarterly reports covering progress in the physical implementation of the Project, the use of&#13;
Project funds and, where appropriate, the Project's impact. The format of these reports would be agreed&#13;
with the Bank's supervision missions. The reports would be consolidated by the PMC into quarterly&#13;
progress reports to be submitted through the Ministry of Finance to the Bank (and relevant co-financiers)&#13;
within two months of the end of each reporting period. These progress reports would also include an&#13;
implementation plan and work program for the six months following the reporting period. The PMC's&#13;
fourth-quarter report would serve as the annual PMC progress report summarizing the achievement of one&#13;
year.&#13;
4.17         Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that the Borrower would monitor and evaluate&#13;
(M&amp;E) the Project on an ongoing basis using performance indicators satisfactory to the Bank/, and that&#13;
this M&amp;E function would continue until Project disbursement completion; and that GOM would prepare&#13;
a mid-term review of the Project's performance by April 1, 1998 analyzing, among others, the results of&#13;
the M&amp;E up to end-December 1997, and would review this report and GOM's plan for future&#13;
implementation taking into account the conclusions of the M&amp;E analysis, with the Bank by June 30, 1998&#13;
(para. 6.1(g)). This report would also include proposals for any necessary revisions to the Project&#13;
Implementation Plans.&#13;
4.18         Upon completion of the Project, the Ministry of Finance, with the collaboration of the&#13;
PMC, would prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) with a scope satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
to be submitted to the Bank and co-financiers within six months after Project completion.&#13;

F. Project Supervision&#13;
4.19         While there is, as yet, no experience with implementing investment projects in Moldova,&#13;
there would not be more than the usual intensity for Bank supervision (about 18 staff weeks annually).&#13;
Under the proposed program of loans, supervision, preparation and appraisal for the continuing program&#13;
would be effectively blended together. The supervision missions would use the Project Objectives and&#13;
Development Indicators (Table 5.3) to assess the attainment of project and development objectives. It is&#13;
recommended that Bank supervision include:&#13;
a)    a Project-launch mission to establish, with the PMC, the operational, accounting and reporting&#13;
procedures for the Special Account;&#13;
b)    supervision of the PPF, including Bank staff facilitation of the donor-funded participation and&#13;
social assessment training by consultants;&#13;
c)    semi-annual supervision missions, to review the status of Project implementation and assist with&#13;
any issues that might arise. The first supervision mission would take place within three months&#13;
of effectiveness;&#13;
d)    an implementation review to be carried out within 12 months after loan effectiveness to determine&#13;
any revisions that might be needed in the implementation plans; this implementation review would&#13;
be conducted in conjunction with a supervision mission;&#13;
e)    desk reviews of the periodic environmental reviews of the IPM component;&#13;
f)    a mid-term  review, not later than end-June 1998, to be carried out in conjunction with a&#13;
supervision mission, based on GOM's own mid-term review prepared by April 1998 reviewing&#13;
inter alia M&amp;E peTformance indicators as of end-December 1997; and&#13;
g)    a completion review of implementation to be carried out within six months of the receipt of the&#13;
ICR from the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits and Justification&#13;
5.1           The major benefits of the Project are:&#13;
(a)    Economic:&#13;
*      increased efficiency of agricultural production through the application of&#13;
agricultural research results;&#13;
*      increased export earnings by enhanced quality of the major export products;&#13;
*      improved performance of agro-processing enterprises' management cadre; and&#13;
*      reduced negative environmental impact from pest management activities&#13;
(b)    Institutional:&#13;
*      strengthened technology transfer between research and agricultural producers;&#13;
*      maintained and expanded human resources, intellectual property and capacity in&#13;
the research system;&#13;
*      plans for future rationalization of the agricultural research system;&#13;
*      plans for a national extension service; and&#13;
*      improved institutional capacity for sector policy determination, and consultation&#13;
with stakeholders.&#13;
5.2           The quantifiable benefits would become evident by: (i) increasing the efficiency of&#13;
agricultural production at the farm level; (ii) improving the quality, quantity and value of agricultural&#13;
product exports; and (iii) reducing the negative impacts of agricultural production on the environment (e.g.&#13;
water conservation, improved crop protection and other on-farm environment practices).&#13;
5.3           Given the nature of research investments, calculating specific ERR's would be misleading,&#13;
as their actual achievement demands further investments for primary production and product processing&#13;
(para 5.10). The factors impeding a quantification of the potential benefits of the Project's R&amp;D&#13;
investments are: the lack of reliable statistical data on agriculture; the uncertainty of the evolving farming&#13;
structure; and the long-term nature of the benefits from investments in research. Official agricultural&#13;
statistics are in disarray and it is difficult to obtain reliable information even on such basic information&#13;
as the quantity and value of wine exports. In addition, the existing farm structure, still consisting of large&#13;
un-restructured cooperative farms, is likely to change in the near future. At this point in time, it is&#13;
uncertain what kind of private and cooperative farms will evolve in the future, making it difficult to select&#13;
typical farm models representative of future farm structures with which to estimate the economic impact&#13;
of new technologies at the farm level.&#13;
5.4           The economic justification of this Project is therefore based on experience with similar&#13;
projects in other regions, on a qualitative assessment of the expected outcome, and on a "reverse" analysis&#13;
(the "feasibility analysis" -- paras 5.10 et seq.) to determine the level of benefits to be achieved that&#13;
would justify the proposed level of incremental R&amp;D investments.&#13;
5.5           Country and Agricultural Assistance Strategy. Horticulture and wine products generate&#13;
around 25% of all export earnings, and are expected to increase their share over the next decade. The&#13;
Agricultural Sector Review (1994) and the Moldova Country Report on Agricultural Trade and Trade&#13;
Policies (1995) state that these two sectors have high comparative advantage and are key to the&#13;
agricultural export-led growth strategy. Targeting project investments to key export crops fits with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Benefits and Risks                                                                        39&#13;
Moldova's demonstrated comparative advantage' and supports the country assistance strategy of promoting&#13;
export-lead growth from agriculture. The expected benefits from this project (i.e. improved product&#13;
quality and research institutional strengthening) also directly contribute to export growth and thus to&#13;
achieving the overall country and sector strategy objectives.&#13;
5.6           Public Sector. Agricultural research has been a public sector activity in the past and the&#13;
priority research to be funded in the future would remain a public good. Agricultural research in Moldova&#13;
is going through a difficult transition period as the research institutions adapt to serving a private&#13;
agricultural sector. Also in the future, the majority of the results expected from publicly funded&#13;
agricultural research can be described as a collective good because they are available to all farmers and&#13;
agro-enterprises, are generally not sold, and no interested party could be excluded from using the research&#13;
results. Consequently, individual beneficiaries would be reluctant to contribute to the costs of such&#13;
research. In addition, the benefits of the expected research results are expected to provide profitable&#13;
retums in the medium future. This reduces the incentives for agricultural farms and processing companies&#13;
in transition to invest in research because they are focussing on immediate profits. GOM would therefore&#13;
continue to finance, with budget resources, key research institutions for applied research with a direct&#13;
impact on agricultural production and general export efficiency.&#13;
5.7           Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery. A part of the output of the research institutes -- vine,&#13;
fruit products, and improved planting material (vinestocks, rootstocks, or fruit tree seedlings) -- would be&#13;
directly sold by the institutes and the revenues would be used to recover capital and operating expenses&#13;
of the nurseries. It is estimated (Table 5.1) that NIVO and Codru would be able to fully recover the costs&#13;
for the plantation and production of the base planting material for vineyards for fruit tree nurseries&#13;
through sales of improved planting material to farmers. Similarly, the capital costs of the wine and fruit&#13;
processing experimental plants would be partially recovered through sale of product. In total, between&#13;
30% and 40% of the project's investment costs are estimated to be recovered through sales by the&#13;
institutes. The other investment sub-components do not allow for cost recovery because of the public&#13;
good nature of these investments. The Project, through the agricultural knowledge system study, will&#13;
directly contribute to GOM's analysis of future cost sharing for agriculture research with the private sector.&#13;

5.8          The with and without Project Comparison. Without the Project, the research institutes&#13;
would continue modest research programs focussed mainly on improving available techniques and cultivars&#13;
developed in the FSU. Even though the research programs have been moderately successful in the past,&#13;
importing foreign vine and fruit tree varieties, and introducing improved production, harvesting and&#13;
processing techniques, would have a much higher pay-off than continuing to improve existing varieties&#13;
and techniques. The Project would provide these institutes with the necessary financial resources to:&#13;
import successful European vine and fruit tree cultivars, and test and distribute them to farmers in the&#13;
country; upgrade laboratory equipment; analyze westem production technologies; commence a scientific&#13;
exchange program with foreign research institutes; and improve the training program to farmers. The&#13;
Project would enable the country's exports to meet the high quality standards of these products demanded&#13;
by international markets. The project's contribution to better research facilities would have an additional&#13;
important benefit: the increased capability to retain the intellectual capital in the institutes -- reducing the&#13;
"brain drain."&#13;
(a)    Project ImRact on Farmers' Incomes. Ultimately, the benefits of the project-funded&#13;
research should be reflected in improved farmers' incomes. These benefits will not be&#13;
realized without additional on-farm investments, the public efforts to transfer these new&#13;
technologies to the farm (i.e research outreach and agricultural extension), and adequate&#13;
production financing. A projection of the changes in yield and costs of production has&#13;
been made.2 The average farm  size, if all eligible farmers were to receive their&#13;
proportionate share of the arable land in Moldova, would be 1.5 ha. A small-farm model&#13;
on this basis, with the average crop-field distributions between annual crops, perennial&#13;
crops, and pastures, shows increases in net income (Table 5.2), without assuming any&#13;
increases in the farm-gate value of product due to improved quality. These assumptions&#13;
yield an annual average real growth in family income of 11% -- significantly higher than&#13;
average GDP per capita growth expectations. However, family farm income even after&#13;
increasing production, would remain significantly below the average GDP per capita of&#13;
US $870 in 1994.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Benefits and Risks                                                                        41&#13;
5.9           Benefits and Development Indicators. A large number of studies have consistently found&#13;
exceptionally high returns to publicly funded agricultural research. Despite recent increases in developing&#13;
country public expenditures on agricultural research, studies suggest that rates of return for agricultural&#13;
research and smallholder extension continue to be well above those for other investments3. The qualitative&#13;
benefits of the Project investments in Viticulture, Horticulture, and Integrated Pest Management, are&#13;
summarized in Table 5.3 This table shows the link between the planned investments, the immediate&#13;
objective of the investment, and the expected benefits, and links it to monitoring indicators. The&#13;
monitoring indicators can be used to determine the long-term impact of the Project investment on&#13;
agricultural output in key areas. Further, this table gives a qualitative estimation of the economic benefits&#13;
of the project.&#13;
(a)    Viticulture Improvement. The major benefits of the viticulture improvement component&#13;
can be grouped into yield enhancement, quality improvements, and reduction of losses, which&#13;
would increase profits from wine production. Reductions in crop losses and in the cost of pest&#13;
management will be facilitated through use of pest forecasting models. It is estimated that by&#13;
replanting existing vineyards with commonly used European vine cultivars (e.g. Chardonnay or&#13;
Merlot), yield enhancements (about I tlha) and quality improvements could be achieved which&#13;
would, in turn, lead to higher export added values and volumes. The Project would support&#13;
applied research and the establishment of a trial nursery to test internationally used vine cultivars&#13;
in order to adapt foreign grape varieties and vine clones to the regional soils and climate, and&#13;
consumer preferences in export markets. It thereby supports the development of a Moldovan&#13;
"appelation controlee" system aimed at improving the quality of Moldovan wine and developing&#13;
a distinctive taste -- important for international marketing.&#13;
(b)    Horticulture Improvement.  The major benefits of the horticulture improvement&#13;
investments are yield enhancement, quality improvements, and reduction of production costs&#13;
through improved water and energy saving technologies. Expected benefits of the demonstration&#13;
technologies in drip irrigation include yield increases, quality improvements, and considerable&#13;
water savings as compared to the presently used sprinkler irrigation. For example, yields of&#13;
irrigated apple orchards are estimated to be more than 50% higher than on non-irrigated orchards,&#13;
and yields of tomatoes on drip irrigated fields are estimated to be at least 25% higher than under&#13;
irrigation with sprinklers. Improved crop protection through the introduction of hand-carried&#13;
(ultra-light volume) sprayers is estimated to reduce both pesticide application levels, and crop&#13;
losses by up to 35% on private orchards. The use of plasticulture could increase the growing&#13;
season of fruits by one month in spring and about one month in fall, adding to the off-season&#13;
supply, increasing farmers incomes and lowering consumer food costs in this period.&#13;
(c)    Integrated Pest Management. There are three major benefits to introducing integrated pest&#13;
management technologies: (i) improved product quality (horticulture and viticulture product&#13;
quality is especially sensitive to correct pest management); (ii) reduced production costs; and (iii)&#13;
the reduction of the amount of nitrates and pesticides in agricultural run-off, and the reduction in&#13;
pesticide residues in the food.&#13;

Benefits and Risks                                                                        43&#13;
5.10          Economic Analysis.4  The quantifiable benefits directly attributable to investments in&#13;
research (i.e. improved product quality and decreased production and processing costs) could not be&#13;
isolated from benefits attributable to additional necessary investments benefits on- and off-farm. Therefore,&#13;
a "feasibility" approach for research and development (R&amp;D) investment was undertaken to answer: To&#13;
achieve an ERR of 10%, is the level of incremental exports' added value, assignable as direct benefits&#13;
from the incremental R&amp;D expenditures, a reasonable assumption and a feasible attainment?&#13;
5.11          Incremental exports for wine and horticulture were projected to reflect both the impact&#13;
of the Project's R&amp;D investments as well as the overall impact of GOM's agricultural exports-led&#13;
development strategy.5 The net present value (NPV -- at 10% discount rate) for the added value of these&#13;
exports was compared with the NPV of the project's research and development (R&amp;D) investments (Table&#13;
5.4). These results are interpreted as follows: for the project's R&amp;D investmnents to earn the equivalent&#13;
ERR of 10%, the NPV of the incremental R&amp;D investment should be equivalent to not more than 8.6%&#13;
of the added value of the projected increased exports over the next 15 years. The wine and horticulture&#13;

5.12          Table 5.5 shows the range of equivalent levels of directly attributable benefits from&#13;
incremental R&amp;D to justify the R&amp;D expenditures of a range of desired ERR's. The Project would&#13;
achieve an ERR of 25% if the added value of the incremental export revenues from wines and horticulture&#13;
products that can be attributed to the Project activities would increase to 15%. Both as a proportion of&#13;
export revenues, and in absolute value terms, this achievability is not an unreasonable assumption, given&#13;
the projected growth rates for wine and horticulture exports.&#13;

5.13         The Project is likely to produce benefits even if the planned land reform and&#13;
sector reforms are slow to emerge (pam 5.15). The estimated level of benefits are achievable&#13;
within the context of the projected necessary growth in agricultural exports required to underpin&#13;
the general economic recovery scenario. Even if the new technologies were transferred to the&#13;
relatively less efficiency collective farms, given the relatively low levels of added value from&#13;
incremental exports required to provide an adequate return, these export projections are&#13;
achievable.&#13;
B. Project Sustainability and Risk&#13;
5.14         Project support is directed to the viticulture and horticulture research institutes tasked with&#13;
improving the major agricultural export products of the country; two of the key institutes out of the about&#13;
18 existing research institutes involved in agricultural research. GOM has already demonstrated its&#13;
commitment to continue to fund the applied research program in these institutes by providing a&#13;
proportionately higher level of funding than to other research institutes and has committed itself to&#13;
continuing this level of support. GOM has ensured the continuation of funding for the small EPM&#13;
component.&#13;
5.15         Identified risks, and the mitigating factors adopted under this project, or within the context&#13;
of the Bank's country assistance program, are shown in Table 5.5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Benefits and Risks                                                                            45&#13;
Table 5.6: Project Risks &amp; Mitigations&#13;
Risk                                     Proposed Mitigation&#13;
Slow progress with sector reforms in land      As the Project focusses mainly on public goods, its&#13;
reform, post-privatization restructuring of    impact is not tied to speed or depth of land reform.&#13;
agro-industries,                               Implementation is neutral to land reform policy.&#13;
However, to achieve sectoral growth and maximize&#13;
and                                            the usefulness of the public goods being financed,&#13;
land and other sector reforms will be necessary.&#13;
slow emergence of rural and agricultural       These reforms and the creation of an enabling&#13;
services entrepreneurship, and especially, in  environment to spur adjustment towards&#13;
international trade in agricultural products.  entrepreneurship, export competitiveness and&#13;
growth, are supported by ongoing and planned Bank&#13;
projects,4 the IMF and other donor's programs.&#13;
Climatic risk to agricultural production       Applied research will be directed at selecting&#13;
through frequent droughts in the southern, and   drought and frost relevant varieties. In addition,&#13;
early frost in the northern, parts of the      demonstrations of new irrigation techniques are&#13;
country.                                       aimed at reducing drought risk.&#13;
Inadequate budget resources made available     Agreements, confirmed at Negotiations, ensure&#13;
from GOM budget for: (i) the research          adequate funding commitments and institutional&#13;
institutions; and (ii) Project management.     arrangements for the timely transfers of GOM&#13;
budget funds to the Project. Assistance to increase&#13;
the Research institutions' self-financing through sale&#13;
of research products (improved varieties, etc.) will&#13;
be provided through the Project.&#13;
Slow adoption of new technologies and          The Project strengthens extension activities&#13;
adapted varieties from research institutions due   organized directly through research institutes and&#13;
to the slow pace of sector reforms.            plans for the improved general extension service.&#13;
Market pressures from the open trade regime being&#13;
supported by ongoing and planned Bank operations&#13;
are expected to provide sufficient incentives to&#13;
producers to seek cost efficient production.&#13;

Viticulture Improvement&#13;
The following model has been developed to provide reasonable projections over a period of 15 years&#13;
(from 1996 to year 2010) of production, domestic consumption and exports of wine. Key variables&#13;
and assumptions of the model are as follows:&#13;
*     The total area of vineyards in the country is estimated to be in the order of 160,000&#13;
hectares. Ninety percent of this area produce grapes for wine production, and the&#13;
remaining 10% of the area are cultivated for the production of table grapes.&#13;
Replanting of vineyards is assumed to be conducted in the future at a rate of 6.7% per&#13;
annum of the vineyards for wine grapes, based on a life cycle of 15 years. It is&#13;
estimated that replanting of vines for wine grapes would cover 9,600 ha/year&#13;
(calculated at 6.7% x 90% x 160,000 ha).&#13;
*     Adovtion Rate. It is expected improved varieties and cultivars adapted to the local&#13;
agronomic conditions would be made available through the Project activities to NIVO&#13;
NIVO would then distribute these varieties to the farming sector. It is assumed that&#13;
20% of the area replanted annually would be replanted with the improved varieties in&#13;
1998, increasing to 35% in 1999, 50% in year 2000, 70% in year 200, levelling off at&#13;
80% from year 2002 onwards.&#13;
-     Yields of wine grapes per hectare are assumed to be 4.8 tons/ha on average for&#13;
existing vineyards. Improved varieties are expected to yield 2 tons/ha in the third year&#13;
years after planting, 4.5 tons after 4 years, and 7 tons/ha after 5 years. Newly&#13;
replanted areas with existing varieties are projected to yield 1.5 tons/ha after 3 years,&#13;
3.2 tons/ha after 4 years, peaking at 5.5 tons/ha after 5 years. It is assumed that the&#13;
grape production of the first two years after planting would not be processed.&#13;
*     Present extraction rates of wine from grapes are low, and estimated at 65%. It is&#13;
expected that with the introduction of improved equipment at the wineries, the average&#13;
extraction rate would improve to 67% in 1997, 70% in 1998, 73% in 1998, 75% in&#13;
1999, levelling off at 80% from year 2000 onwards.&#13;
Domestic consumption of wine in Moldova is estimated to be at 30 liters per capita in&#13;
1996, comparable to wine consumption in Rumania in the early 1980's. Domestic&#13;
consumption of wine is projected to grow reasonably at 1.5% per annum over the&#13;
&#13;

period from 1996 to year 2010.&#13;
Wine exports to western markets. Wine production in excess of domestic consumption&#13;
is assumed to be exported to FSU countries and Western markets. Exports for western&#13;
markets are projected to amount to 150,000 hi in 1996; 250,000 hi in 1997; 300,000 hl&#13;
in 1998 and 400,000 hl in year 2000. Bulk wine exports to Western markets will be&#13;
completely substituted with bottled wine from 1998. Export volumes to Western&#13;
markets are projected to grow at 10% per annum from year 2001 onwards. This rate&#13;
of growth is considered conservative, given the potential for marketing Moldovan wine&#13;
in North America and some parts of Western Europe (United Kingdom, Germany and&#13;
Holland).&#13;
*     Wine Exports to FSU markets the remaining amount for exports (after exports to&#13;
Western markets), are projected to consist of bulk wine (42%), bottled wine (27%),&#13;
and wine equivalents in the form of brandy and fortified spirits (31%).&#13;
*      Export prices (FOB, Moldova) in constant 1995 terms are US $0.40/liter of bulk wine&#13;
for Western markets, US $1.20/liter for bottled wine for Western markets. These&#13;
prices for Western markets are based on market studies undertaken for the EBRD&#13;
Wine Export Promotion Project. Prices for FSU markets are considerably lower&#13;
because of different wine qualities and standards for bottling and packaging. For the&#13;
FSU markets, bulk wine is priced at US $0.15/liter, bottled wine at US $0.55/liter,&#13;
brandy and fortified spirits at US $0.19/liter of wine equivalent.&#13;
With progressive adoption of improved varieties in replanting, and gradual improvement in extraction&#13;
rtes, wine production is expected to increase to 4.5 million hi in year 2001, 5.0 million hi in 2005&#13;
and 5.8 million hi in 2010, after an initial decrease from about 4.2 million hi in 1996 to 4.0 million in&#13;
1998. Using the level of exports in 1996 as a benchmark (total wine export in 1996 is projected at&#13;
US $83 million), the present value of the expected added values' of incremental wine exports for the&#13;
period 1997 to 2010 discounted at 10% per year (including its equivalents in brandy and fortified&#13;
spirits) is projected to reach US $112 million. In comparison, the present value of the incremental&#13;
research and development costs, as provided under the project for viticulture improvement, would&#13;
amount to only US $4.2 million. This amount of incremental R&amp;D costs represents no more than&#13;
3.7% of the present value of the expected added values from increases in wine exports (Table 3).&#13;
1.    Incremenal added value is calculated by applying a gradually improving added value from 25% in 1996 to about 43%&#13;
in 2010, with a weighted average of 33%/, based on the projected sntm of incremental values of exports.&#13;

Horticulture Improvement&#13;
A similar model is developed for estimating future production and exports of fruit and berries, and&#13;
vegetables. Key variables and assumptions of the model are as follows:&#13;
Fruit and Berries&#13;
Planted area of all types of fruit and berries is estimated at 229,000 ha, and projected&#13;
to be stable over the next 15 years. The average immature period of plantations is&#13;
estimated at 4.5 years, and the overall average life cycle assumed to be 15 years. The&#13;
effective productive area is therefore assumed to be around 160,000 ha in any given&#13;
year, provided replanting is conducted regularly and on schedule.&#13;
For projection purposes no distinction is made on types of fruit and berries. Yields,&#13;
production and export volumes are expressed as averages of all types combined.&#13;
Yields. The average yield/ha, in the case without incremental research and&#13;
development activities (without Project), is projected at 5.5 tons/ha in 1996, and&#13;
increasing annually at a growth rate of 2% to reach 7.3 tons/ha by year 2010. With&#13;
incremental research and development (with Project), yields are expected to be higher&#13;
than the without Project yield by 2% in 1998, 5% in year 2000, 12% in year 2005,&#13;
reaching 8.3 tons/ha in year 2010 or 15% higher than the without Project yield. This&#13;
is a conservative yield assumption.&#13;
The projected incremental production. as a result of incremental research and&#13;
development, is assumed to be available for exports. The quantities available for&#13;
exports are categorized into fresh (25%) and canned/preserved (75%).&#13;
The average gross mgin of fruit production are calculated at US $50/ton for fresh&#13;
fiuit and berries and US $100/ton for canned products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Vegetables&#13;
*     Planted area of all types of vegetables, including area planted with tomato, is estimated&#13;
at 74,000 ha and assumed to be stable over the next 15 years.&#13;
*     For projection purposes no distinction is made on types of vegetables. Yields,&#13;
production and export volumes are expressed as averages of all types combined.&#13;
*     The average yield/ha, in the case without incremental research and development&#13;
activities, is projected at 12 tons/ha in 1996, and increasing annually at a growth rate&#13;
of 2% to reach 15.8 tons/ha by year 2010. With incremental research and&#13;
development, yield is expected to be higher than that of the without-case by 2% in&#13;
1998, 5% in year 2000, 12% in year 2005, reaching 18.2 tons/ha in year 2010 or 15%&#13;
higher than that under the without-case.&#13;
*     The projected incremental production. as a result of incremental research and&#13;
development, is assumed to be available for exports. The quantities available for&#13;
exports are categorized into fresh (40%) and canned (60%).&#13;
*     The average gross marg2ins are calculated at US $40/ton for fresh vegetables and US&#13;
$75/ton for canned products.&#13;
With incremental research and development, the incremental amounts of exports of fruits and berries,&#13;
and vegetables are projected as follows:&#13;
Table 2: Incremental Production ('000 tons)&#13;
year 2000    year 2005     year 2010&#13;
Fresh fruit and berries                12            32           44&#13;
Canned/preserved fruit                 36            95           131&#13;
Fresh vegetables                        19           51           70&#13;
Canned/preserved vegetables            29            76           105&#13;
Added values on the projected increases in exports of fruit, berries and vegetables are calculated on&#13;
the basis of gross margins per ton of products. The net present value of these added values, over a&#13;
period of 15 years from 1996 to 2010 and discounted at 10% per annum, amounts to US $76 million.&#13;
In comparison, the present value of the incremental costs of research and development for horticultural&#13;
improvement, as provided under the project, amounts to US $2 million. This incremental research and&#13;
development cost represents only 2.7% of the expected added values gained from projected increases&#13;
in export earnings (Table 3).&#13;

Viticulture and Horticulture Improvement&#13;
with Integrated Pest Management&#13;
The projected added values of incremental exports of wine, fruit and vegetables are estimated to&#13;
amount to US $188 million in present value terms at an annual discount rate of 10% over 15 years&#13;
(1996 to 2010) (Table 3). In comparison, the present value of the overall incremental costs of&#13;
research and development, as provided under the project and including the costs of the IPM&#13;
development, amounts to US $6.8 million. This incremental spending in research and development is&#13;
modest, representing only 3.6% of the present value of the expected added values from increases in&#13;
exports. This means that the benefits that must be directly attributed to the R&amp;D investments would&#13;
only need to amount to 3.6% of the added values of the expected increases in exports, in order for the&#13;
R&amp;D investments to yield an economic rate of return of 10%. For the ERR of the R&amp;D investments&#13;
to reach 15%, the associated benefits must amount to only 5% of the added values of the expected&#13;
increases in exports. In the case when the ERR is 20%, the required benefits should be not more than&#13;
6.7% of the added values on incremental exports (Table 4).&#13;
The introduction of integrated pest management through better forecasting and control of pest&#13;
problems, improved control on the use of pesticides, and the establishment of an early warning system&#13;
for pest management, would reduce production losses through pests. The costs of these initiatives, as&#13;
provided under the project, are small compared to the benefits potentially gained from improved pest&#13;
management and control. The IPM initiatives under the project will not only benefit horticulture and&#13;
viticulture, but also food crops and grain production. The additional costs for IPM development&#13;
would reduce risks of crop failures due to pest problems. For illustration purposes, a reduction in&#13;
added values of only 0.5% (a highly possible case for localized pest problems) would mean a loss in&#13;
present value of benefits of US $1 million. Such a small loss in benefits has outweighed the costs of&#13;
IPM development by twofold.&#13;

Farm Budget Models&#13;
Project Impact on Farmers' Incomes. Ultimately, the benefits of the project-funded research&#13;
should be reflected in improved farmers' incomes. These benefits will not be realized&#13;
without additional on-farm investments, the public efforts to transfer these new technologies&#13;
to the farm (i.e research outreach and agricultural extension), and adequate production&#13;
financing. A projection of the changes in yield and costs of production has been made. The&#13;
average farm size, if all eligible farmers were to receive their proportionate share of the&#13;
arable land in Moldova, would be 1.5 ha. A small-farm model on this basis, with the&#13;
average crop-field distributions between annual crops, perennial crops, and pastures, shows&#13;
increases in net income (Table 5.2), without assuming any increases in the farm-gate value of&#13;
product due to improved quality. These assumptions yield an annual average real growth in&#13;
family income of 11 % -- significantly higher than average GDP per capita growth&#13;
expectations. However, family farm income even after increasing production, would remain&#13;
significantly below the average GDP per capita of US $870 in 1994.&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
- The cropping structure of the farm model was established by prorating an average year's&#13;
national cropping areas. The cropping might undergo some changes as time goes, because&#13;
farmers will be guided by prevailing market opportunities.&#13;
- The farm model size of 1.5 ha consists of 1.0 ha annual crops on arable land, 0.3 ha fruits&#13;
and grapes, and 0.2 ha of meadows and pastures. The size corresponds approximately the&#13;
typical land allocation of a smallholder farm.&#13;
- The exchange rate of $ 1 to Lei 4.5 was used.&#13;
- All production cost and producer prices are based on the mid-95 data collected by MAF&#13;
staff.&#13;
- The fertilizer calculations are based on an average whole crop offtake of pure nutrients,&#13;
discounted for the fertility of chernozems, replenished by remaining crop residues.&#13;
- The fertilizer and pesticide prices are at, or close to, world market prices; the&#13;
mechanization prices are somewhat lower, accounting for the still relatively cheap energy and&#13;
labor cost.&#13;
- Other technical data, like seed rates, mechanization hours, labor etc. are based on&#13;
information from Moldova technicians, contained in my mission blocks, and on international&#13;
literaure data.&#13;

COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
IMPROVING MOLDOVAN WINE PRODUCTION&#13;
I. THE VITICULTURE COMPONENT&#13;
A. COMPONENT OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The broad objective of the wine production component of the Project is to improve the quality&#13;
of Moldovan wine in order to generate additional foreign exchange revenues from exports and increase&#13;
the profitability of the wine sector. The development of new export markets has become a major pre-&#13;
condition to restoring economic growth and stability in Moldova. The component would in particular (a)&#13;
support research and development of suitable grape varieties and vine clones adapted to the regional soil&#13;
and climate and to consumer preferences in export markets; (b) improve the production of quality planting&#13;
materials in modernized nurseries and with improvements in plant protection; and (c) provide facilities&#13;
to test new production methods and systems.&#13;
B. COMPONENT SCOPE&#13;
2.    Wine and sparkling wine production plays an important role in Moldovan agriculture with around&#13;
160,000 ha under vineyards. This accounts for 8% of agricultural land. Wine production represents one&#13;
of the major comparative advantages of the country and it has good medium-term export market prospects.&#13;
However, a large part of the wine products are of relatively low quality for EU markets, and need to be&#13;
improved in order to produce wines of competitive quality, both in the EU and in the FSU, where in the&#13;
latter market, both EU and Eastern European wines (e.g Hungarian and Bulgarian) are now making&#13;
inroads into Moldova's traditional markets. As identified in the Moldova Agricultural Sector Review, the&#13;
wine industry can be improved through increasing grape yields and improving the quality of wine&#13;
products, improved processing, adoption of standardized packaging and improved marketing.&#13;
3.    Most of the wineries have been privatized in the 1993-94 program. However, a number of wineries&#13;
producing brandy and sparkling wines have not been privatized and the Government is still in the process&#13;
of working out the details of an eventual privatization. A number of international wine companies have&#13;
already expressed interest in entering into joint-venture agreements with local wineries at a later stage.&#13;
4.    This proposed component would concentrate on assisting the research efforts on improving wine&#13;
quality at both field the processing levels. Project interventions would support research and development&#13;
of vine varieties adapted to the local climatic conditions, improvements with new vine nursery stocks, and&#13;
with experimental wine processing equipment. The Project could be complementary to an already existing&#13;
project, funded by EBRD, which focusing specifically on 4 commercial wineries, to promote those&#13;
wineries' exports, and on the provision of a new wine bottle production plant.&#13;
5.     Wine varieties. Production of wine-based products in Moldova is equally divided between&#13;
sparkling wines, brandy, and still wines. Due to the changing market environment, new and improved&#13;
vine varieties will have to replace a large part of the varieties that have been introduced to the country&#13;
according to policies defined 30 years ago. Over the last years some wine producers have started to&#13;
introduce and plant more aromatic varieties in Moldova, such as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon.&#13;
However, varieties of lesser wine quality still cover a large part of the area under vines. Developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CIP I&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
quality dry wine (white and red) with individual character and adaption to the international market depends&#13;
on the selection and planting of the right vine varieties. Efforts are already underway to introduce an&#13;
"appellation controlee" system in Moldova. The legal framework for this system was established in 1992&#13;
and a law governing viticulture practices was passed in 1994. Even though growing widely known and&#13;
prestigious varieties is a good short-term strategy to increase profitability of wine production, it is&#13;
nevertheless recommended to widen the varieties grown in and adapted to Moldova.&#13;
6.    New and improved vine varieties are best introduced through the natural replacement of old vines.&#13;
The average life cycle of vines in Moldova is 15 years, and approximately 6-7% of the country's&#13;
vineyards should be replanted every year to maintain the present area under wine production. Some 9,000&#13;
hectares of the total area under vines, of 143,000 ha, have to be replanted annually. Total current demand&#13;
for planting material is 22 million plants per year, at current plant density and mortality rates.&#13;
7.    The quality of the vine planting stock from specialized nurseries has an overriding influence on&#13;
the success of planting to new vine varieties. Improving the production of the vine planting stock will&#13;
enable the nurseries to produce higher quality plants that can be sold at lower costs than presently&#13;
possible. Commercial success will crucially depend on selection of suitable and marketable varieties,&#13;
optimal growing conditions in the vine nurseries, improved grafting of the vines and a wider variety of&#13;
rootstocks.&#13;
8.    Rootstocks. Moldova is in the process of building up a certified rootstock production. Currently&#13;
only three rootstocks are commonly used in the country (101-14, 5BB, S04) and they are not best adapted&#13;
to the low rainfall areas in Moldova. Other rootstocks have been successfully used in other countries&#13;
under similar climatic conditions. It is anticipated that they could be used with great success in Moldova&#13;
as well.&#13;
9.    Production of grafted vines. Presently thirty farms operate workshops devoted to multiplying and&#13;
producing vine plants in nurseries in the field. All of these do not have their own rootstock mother vines,&#13;
which are trained in the same way as normal grape vines. Methods of grafting vary from one workshop&#13;
to the other and the grafting success rate is often as low as only 10%. The success of grafting could be&#13;
increased to 45% if grating techniques were improved in conjunction with the introduction of irrigation&#13;
in the nursery fields.&#13;
10.   Research and development of vine varieties. The National Institute of Viticulture and Oenology&#13;
(NIVO) has in the past been responsible for adapted research to improve Moldovan wine production. In&#13;
the future, NIVO will continue to be the major research agency but would need external support to&#13;
develop cloned and certified vine plants with excellent agronomic characteristics and healthiness. The new&#13;
vine varieties, developed and adapted to the country's soils and climate, would then gradually replace all&#13;
the currently used plants. Under the existing circumstances it would be advisable to continue the clonal&#13;
development at NIVO, and complement this with imported vegetative material. Improved clonal parent&#13;
material would have to be imported through a contract signed with a western wine research institute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CIP I&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
C. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
11.   The component would support the development, production and distribution of improved vine&#13;
varieties in Moldova. It would provide the framework to coordinate and respond to the common interests&#13;
of the wine industry, including the wine research facilities, vine plant producers, winegrower and&#13;
processors. The component would concentrate on (a) supporting research and development at the National&#13;
Institute of Viticulture and Oenology; (b) improving the quality of vine plants produced in nurseries; and&#13;
(d) improving the experimental wine production facilities at NIVO.&#13;
12.   With this component, the Project would support the development of a national wine development&#13;
and improvement program which includes a vinestock certification program. The vinestock certification&#13;
program would consist of the following steps:&#13;
-     Selection and development of initial material at NIVO based on the clones selected at the&#13;
Institute,&#13;
-     Distribution of the base material from NIVO to approved nurseries,&#13;
-     Production of certified material in approved nurseries. The certified material would then&#13;
be sold to winegrower.&#13;
(a)    Research and Development. Support to the National Institute of Viticulture and Oenology with&#13;
financial and technical assistance to become the center of a national wine development and improvement&#13;
network.  In particular the Bank would finance the import of clonal material from abroad, the re-&#13;
equipment of the research laboratories; the development and introduction of a vinestock certification&#13;
program; the improvement of experimental wine production facilities; and the establishment of a nation-&#13;
wide experimental network to evaluate the agronomic suitability of rootstocks and vinestocks.&#13;
(b)    Vine plant production. The project component would support the improvement of the vine&#13;
nurseries and grafting workshops. The component would finance modem irrigation equipment for the vine&#13;
nurseries to be established on about 300 hectares, the modernization of equipment used in the 25 existing&#13;
grafting workshops, and foreign training for a grating and nursery specialist.&#13;
(c)    Protection of vines. The project component would finance the purchase of pest risk forecast&#13;
models and training for two specialists. The risk model would have environmental benefits as it reduces&#13;
the number of pesticide applications in vineyards and helps to reduce the costs of plant protection.&#13;
D. COMPONENT COSTS&#13;
13.   The base cost of the viticulture research and development component is estimated at US $8.6&#13;
million. Detailed cost descriptions can be found in Attachment I to this volume of the Annexes.&#13;

II. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROJECT COORDINATION&#13;
14.    The Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) will be responsible for overseeing the activities of&#13;
the National Institute for Oenology and Viticulture. NIVO will coordinate and oversee the activities of&#13;
its own research and clonal selection program and the activities of the vine nurseries. An advisory&#13;
committee, consisting of representatives of NIVO, nursery owners, wine producers and wine processors&#13;
will have advisory functions during development and implementation of the research activities.&#13;
B. ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK DURING SUPERVISION&#13;
15.    The wine production component of the project would be supervised by Bank personnel in&#13;
conjunction with consultants, as and when necessary. It is planned that about 10 staff-weeks of effort&#13;
would be needed for supervision, four weeks during start up year and three weeks in year two to year&#13;
three.&#13;

COMONENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
IMPROVING PRIMARY HORTICULTURE PRODUCTION&#13;
l: THE HORTICULTURE COMPONENT&#13;
A. COMPONENT OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The foremost component objective would be to improve the primary fruit and vegetable production&#13;
through: (a) improving the genetic resource base of fruit crops; (b) demonstrating new technology to&#13;
increase efficiency of production and quality of horticulture produce; and (c) preparing studies, for future&#13;
investment, in areas where there appears to be promising and justifiable potential.&#13;
B. COMPONENT SCOPE&#13;
2.     The horticultural subsector in Moldova has a number of comparative advantages such as excellent&#13;
soils, favorable temperature and sunshine conditions, low labor cost, an agricultural tradition, and also well&#13;
trained, dedicated horticultural specialists and an experienced work force. There are 23 suitably located&#13;
major fruit and vegetable canneries in the country, and a number of smaller processing plants on farms.&#13;
In the past, the country was capable of successfully supplying a large part of the FSU with fresh and&#13;
processed horticultural commodities, produced in excess of domestic requirements.&#13;
3.    Horticultural crops occupy a prominent place in Moldova's land use, representing in 1994 about&#13;
13% of the agricultural land, of which fruit crops about 10% (229,000 ha), and vegetables over 3%&#13;
(74,000 ha). Together with the 164,000 ha of vineyards, these high value crops occupy over 20% of&#13;
agricultural land. Support to this important subsector has a potentially high pay-off and is expected to&#13;
make a significant contribution to the country's economy.&#13;
C. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.    The component would concentrate on: (a) support to the Research Institute for Fruit Production&#13;
("Codru"); (b) demonstrations of modem production technology in Codru for fruit, and in the Research&#13;
Institute for Maize and Sorghum ("Porumbeni") for potato; and (c) preparation of studies of future project&#13;
fundings (possibly including irrigation, glasshouse rehabilitation, and vegetable seed processing).&#13;
Strengthening Primary Production&#13;
5.    Following extensive field visits to fruit and vegetable producing farms, Codruand Porunbeni, and&#13;
extensive discussions with professionals in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) and rayon&#13;
horticulture specialists, the mission identified several major constraints to improved horticultural&#13;
production in Moldova. In close cooperation with Moldovan professionals the mission developed&#13;
proposals for project components that would assist in making a start to removing some of the most&#13;
pressing constraints, and in demonstrating some of the best technical and farm management approaches&#13;
utilized on advanced farms in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                        CIP 2&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
6.     Financing proposals include a set of support actions to Codru, demonstrations on modern&#13;
technology in water-use efficient irrigation techniques, advanced technology in crop protection fitting into&#13;
the IPM system, modern techniques used in potato seed production for Porumbeni, and efficient and cost-&#13;
effective technology of plasticulture.&#13;
7.     The mission further identified the need for studies in areas where insufficient information is&#13;
available for formulating discrete project components, but where there appears to be promising and&#13;
justifiable potential for investments. The studies, if considered to be priorities for the second project&#13;
financing, could include the horticulture aspects for inclusion in the National Irrigation Project Feasibility&#13;
Study, a Review for Rehabilitation of the Glasshouse Production Subsector, and a Review for&#13;
Rehabilitation of the Vegetable Seed Processing Industry. All these interventions are aimed at arresting&#13;
the recent decline and/or variability in production of fruits and vegetables, the decline in vegetable area,&#13;
and at improving quality of the produce.&#13;
Support to the Research Institute for Fruit Production&#13;
8.     Codru in Chisinau, with its main orientation on breeding, technology of seedling production and&#13;
technology of fruit production, plays a crucial role in supporting the more than 200,000 ha of orchards&#13;
in the country. The institute is working with outdated equipment and the current financial situation does&#13;
not even permit procurement of essential reagents urgently needed in the laboratory work. The project&#13;
would support the institute in several ways in order to allow sustainability and small improvements of its&#13;
operations, and publication of the wealth of scientific and applied work developed in recent years:&#13;
(i)    financing of instrumentation and chemicals for the virology, genetics and agronomy departnents;&#13;
(ii)   procurement of five computers with corresponding software;&#13;
(iii)  financing of printing of the long completed, excellent, Fruit Growers Encyclopedia (Encyclopedia&#13;
Sadovodstva), in 3 volumes at 30,000 copies each;&#13;
(iv)   Study visits of Moldovan scientists of 3 months each to reputable foreign institutes in virology,&#13;
fruit tree genetics, and fruit production economics and farm management; and&#13;
(v)    demonstration equipment for "Codru", in its own fields and on farmers' fields, in modern&#13;
irrigation and crop protection technology, as further elaborated on below.&#13;
Demonstrations of Modem Production TechnoloRy&#13;
9.     The component would finance the following crucial elements of modern technology for&#13;
demonstration and production purposes:&#13;
a)    Irrigation: water use efficient irrigation equipment for about 200 ha in the form of drip and mini-&#13;
sprinkler irrigation for vegetables, fruits and berries. The equipment would be placed on&#13;
privatized farms in two drought-prone districts (tentatively have selected the districts of Orhei and&#13;
Aneni-Noi) and in "Codru". It is proposed to place about 20 ha in "Codru" and some 90 ha each&#13;
in the two districts. The component would include technical assistance for installation, training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3                                      CIP &#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
and commissioning of the equipment by the supplier. Additionally, 40 sets of tensiometers would&#13;
be procured (one set for 5 ha, and consisting of 3 tensiometers measuring soil moisture content&#13;
at about 20, 50 and 100 cm) to assist in introduction of proper irrigation agronomy, including&#13;
more accurate timetables of water scheduling. Locally, the responsibility for placement, training&#13;
and demonstrations of the equipment would rest with the MAF (the Principal Department of Fruit&#13;
and Vegetable Production and Processing) and the irrigation water management organization Apele&#13;
Moldova;&#13;
b)    Plant Protection:&#13;
i)    modem boom and air-blast sprayers for protection of vegetables and fruits from insects&#13;
and diseases. These sprayers would be placed in "Codru" and in privatized farms of the above&#13;
two districts not only for commercial crop protection, but also for demonstrations, training of&#13;
operators and field days. The organization of demonstrations and training sessions would be the&#13;
responsibility of the Principal Department of Fruit and Vegetable Production and Processing, and&#13;
the Crop Protection Department of MAF, and the Rayon Crop Protection Stations (formers of&#13;
Fertilitatea, now of MAF). The project would provide 10 boom sprayers with pressure stabilizers&#13;
and exchangeable nozzles and 10 air-blast sprayers, including spare parts and training of operators&#13;
by the supplier; and&#13;
ii)   the crop protection problem for small farmers with their plots of limited size, where&#13;
tractors are uneconomic or cannot operate, is a particular issue since there are actually no hand&#13;
operated sprayers available in Moldova. The mission proposes to finance under the project some&#13;
2,000 modern hand-operated knapsack sprayers with sturdy containers, high quality pumps,&#13;
adjustable booms and pressure stabilizers. The MAF, in cooperation with the Rayon Crop&#13;
Protection Stations, would arrange for field days and demonstrations of the imported sprayers in&#13;
all 40 rayons.&#13;
SuDDort for Porumbeni&#13;
10.   Potato Production Technoloev: potatoes are sometimes on the borderline between vegetables and&#13;
foodcrops. In Moldova, they are within the responsibility of the Principal Department of Fruit&#13;
and Vegetable Production in MAF, although they are often referred to as the "second bread."&#13;
Potato area declined from some 10,000 ha in the mid-80s to about 6,000 ha in 1993, mainly due&#13;
to difficulties in providing high quality seed, which is the single major constraint to higher&#13;
production. In general, interest in growing and consuming potatoes is great. Although favorable&#13;
conditions exist in the north of the country for local seed potato production, suitable technology&#13;
for producing the seed is not available, and also a suitable germplasm base is missing. The&#13;
proposed project would assist in introducing modem seed potato technology on a pilot area of&#13;
about 50 ha. The technology would be placed on a privatized farm and would consist of a chisel&#13;
cultivator, a trailed 4-row potato planter with about a 2 ton container, a 4-row ridger, a 2-row&#13;
potato combine harvester with 2-3 ton container, and a potato sorting line (3-4 sizes, approx. 6&#13;
mt/ha). To provide a base for further multiplication, an initial 150 tons of foundation seed&#13;
potatoes of several varieties would be provided as well; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

1H.    Vegetable Production Plasticulture Technology: the component would finance, on a demonstration&#13;
basis, about 60 ha of equipment for low and walk-in plastic tunnels. The equipment would be&#13;
distributed to privatized farms in the northern, central and southern production zone at about 20&#13;
ha in each zone. It would consists of plastic sheets and the necessary arches.&#13;
Potential Proiect Preparation Studies&#13;
12.    A number of studies for horticulture could be included in the future project preparation. The&#13;
following are the subjects that could be considered and their estimated costs.'&#13;
a)     Irrigation. The Agricultural Sector Review carried out by the Bank in spring 1993 identified as&#13;
one of the priority areas for investment a project for rehabilitation and extension of irrigated areas.&#13;
A reconnaissance mission carried out in December 1994 established that priority investments are&#13;
required for drought protection through completion of developments in nine irrigated perimeters.&#13;
Substantial developments in these nine areas already started under FSU financing and in most of&#13;
the areas construction has been completed to about 50-70%. Draft Terms of Reference for a&#13;
feasibility study for a first phase project have been drawn up. The application of the proposed&#13;
modernized irrigation system to be designed under this feasibility study will need to take into&#13;
consideration the special requirements of intensive fruit and vegetable cultivation, the use of water&#13;
saving technologies in orchards, and in-field, including irrigation in conjunction with vegetable&#13;
cultivation under palatci tunnels and in greenhouses. Also of critical importance to the feasibility&#13;
study is the economics of production of fruit and vegetables under irrigation. The estimated costs&#13;
of the fruit and vegetables cultivation study as input into the national irrigation plan is about&#13;
$150,000.&#13;
b)     Glasshouse Rehabilitation: Moldova disposes of about 88 ha of glasshouses which are believed&#13;
to be highly energy-inefficient and are often in a dilapidated state. In order to regain its position&#13;
as off-season vegetable producer, the country needs to review the situation in glasshouses, prepare&#13;
proposals for rehabilitation, and secure funds for implementation of the rehabilitation of, and&#13;
possibly expansion of, areas. A review of five personmonths by international experts is proposed,&#13;
which is estimated to cost about US$75,000.&#13;
c)     Vegetable Seed Processing. The Bank has been presented by the joint stock company Semintse&#13;
(formnerly Sortsemovoshch) with a request for financing machinery for vegetable seed production&#13;
and processing which could well be in the area of US$6 to 8 million. The request was presented&#13;
without any justification, more detailed technical specifications, and without cost estimates. Since&#13;
there is inadequate information about the company, its organization, management and financial&#13;
position, it is difficult under the given circumstances to respond to the request. It is proposed,&#13;
therefore, to review the vegetable seed production in the country by international experts in the&#13;
field. The cost of the review is estimated at five personmonths and US$75,000.&#13;
1.     The costs of the individual studies are not included in the overall cost table, or the cost table for this&#13;
component: instead a lump-sum allocation for future project preparation costs has bene made in the overall project&#13;
cost estimate, to reflect the fact that the Government will make the final decision on which studies will be prioritized&#13;
for the second project.&#13;

D. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
13.   Detailed cost descriptions can be found in Attachment I to this volume of the Annexes.&#13;
E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
14.   The foreign exchange costs of this component excluding project preparation studies would be&#13;
financed 100% from the Bank loan, while import duties and VAT would be covered by GOM, and local&#13;
cost (installation, local works and operating costs) would be born fully from the budgets of "Codru,"&#13;
"Porumbeni" and the private farms on which the demonstration plots will be installed. "Codru" and the&#13;
farms will achieve costs recovery of the investment and installation local costs from the increased&#13;
production of planting materials for sales, where these new nursery investments have been placed.&#13;
II. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
15.   The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex I of the main report.&#13;
16.   The project components would be implemented primarily by Codru and Porumbeni, in close&#13;
coordination, by the PMC, with the Department of Fruit and Vegetable Production and Processing, and&#13;
the Agricultural Research Department of MAF.2 The design, installation and operation of the drip&#13;
irrigation component would be supervised from the technical point of view by Apele Moldova. At field&#13;
level, the components would be implemented and managed by the respective beneficiaries, i.e. Codru,&#13;
Porumbeni and the privatized farms on whose lands the nurseries would be located.&#13;
17.   The departments of MAF under whose technical responsibility the allocation and supervision of&#13;
these production oriented components and demonstrations would fall, would be required to monitor,&#13;
evaluate and report on the technical and economic experience and results of the new technologies for at&#13;
least three years. The Project Management Committee will have on-staff a full time economist/specialist&#13;
in M&amp;E to assist these departments, Codru and Porumbeni to include the assessment of the economic&#13;
impact of these sub-components alongside the technical performance evaluation. MAF is perfectly&#13;
competent to organize such technical performance monitoring and evaluations; it has demonstrated its&#13;
ability in this respect with excellent results in the case of monitoring and evaluating the modern sugarbeet&#13;
technology imported under the Drought Emergency Recovery Project. The project's technical assistance&#13;
and staff will now add the economic impact dimension to the M&amp;E.&#13;
18.   Detailed performance indicators will be developed by the PMC's M&amp;E specialist, and the initial&#13;
outline is shown in SAR Table 5.3.&#13;
2.    "Codru" and the Departments of MAF are all members of the Project Management Committee (see SAR,&#13;
Chapter 4).&#13;

COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT&#13;
I. THE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT COMPONENT&#13;
A. COMPONENT OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The broad objective of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) component of the project is to&#13;
place crop production on a more economically and environmentally sound basis and support the&#13;
development of a sustainable agriculture in Moldova. IPM is part of an Integrated Crop Management&#13;
approach aimed at reducing the use of agrochemicals. The objective of an ideal IPM system is to use&#13;
all biological and mechanical methods of pest control and to only use chemical pesticides as a last&#13;
resort.&#13;
2.    Moldova already has developed a large number of biological pest control methods that allow&#13;
the reduction of the use of agrochemicals in farming. However, important Moldovan initiatives to&#13;
further promote Integrated Pest Management need external financial and technical support to&#13;
reorganize their research, development and marketing facilities during the transition to a market-based&#13;
agricultural economy. The component would support the development of Integrated Pest Management&#13;
methods, educational programs and the dissemination of the technologies to the farmers, as well as the&#13;
necessary environmental control laboratories.&#13;
B. COMPONENT SCOPE&#13;
3.    The introduction of better and more sustainable agricultural farming methods is a long-term&#13;
process which crucially depends on the cooperation of different agents of change in order to have a&#13;
wide impact on agriculture and to be actually used on the farms. The project component would&#13;
therefore strengthen a number of already existing initiatives in research, education, extension and&#13;
pesticide residue analysis, in order to jump-start the development of sustainable farming in Moldova.&#13;
4.      Existing situation andfuture potential. At present, IPM activities are limited in Moldova.&#13;
Most farms rely almost exclusively on broad spectrum pesticides, which are mainly insecticides and&#13;
fungicides. Herbicide use is limited, because the large farms use farm workers to mechanically and&#13;
manually control weeds. In general, broad-spectrum pesticides are preferred by farmers, because&#13;
farmers feel it is less costly to make one application that kills several pests at the same time, even if&#13;
these pests are not threatening the crop. However, Moldova has a favorable environment to switch to&#13;
Integrated Pest Management, because of the pmsence of organizations already developing and testing&#13;
IPM. For instance, several large farms are already using elements of IPM, but have not yet endorsed&#13;
the full concept.&#13;
5.    Research and development of biocontrol methods. When the FSU dissolved, Moldova was left&#13;
with several high-level agricultural research institutes, formerly responsible for agricultural research in&#13;
the whole FSU. Some of these institutes worked on plant protection and the Institute of Biological&#13;
Plant Protection (IBPP) specifically concentrated research efforts on biological plant protection in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CIP 3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
FSU. The IBPP has developed a number of biological control methods that have been successfully&#13;
applied in the FSU. These include the use of entomophages, parasite trichogramma, and sex&#13;
pheromone to protect agricultural crops against certain pests. Five years ago, the IBPP was arguably&#13;
one of the world's largest producers of biological plant protection agents. Currently, the activities of&#13;
the Institute have come to a near standstill because it lacks the funds to pay the recurrent expenditures.&#13;
The changing economy forces IBPP' to reorganize and actively market their products in order to&#13;
obtain the necessary funds to cover their operating expenditures. Moldova is fortunate to have&#13;
inherited this legacy, for these institutes can offer the technical expertise, biological supplies and&#13;
leadership for establishing a national IPM network.&#13;
6.    Extension and Training. GOM has established a nation wide program, MOLDAGROECO, to&#13;
develop and organize sustainable agriculture in Moldova. Participants includes a wide array of&#13;
scientists, govemment personnel, farm managers, and plant protection offtcers dedicated to supporting&#13;
ecologically sound, organic, biological, and other altemative cropping systems to minimize agricultural&#13;
chemical inputs. Under the MOLDAGROECO program, a pilot demonstration farm and a technical&#13;
training program on sustainable agriculture, targeted at young agriculturalists, have been established.&#13;
The program organizes meetings between the various groups to coordinate activities on sustainable&#13;
agriculture between different Moldovan institutions.&#13;
7.    Pest Forecasting. Moldova has already established a country-wide pest forecasting system&#13;
which is managed by FERTILITATEA. It consists of 40 District Pest Control Stations across the&#13;
country which report information to a forecasting center in Chisinau. The present forecasting system&#13;
is out-dated and relies on teletypes and clerks to process the data. This leads to delays of three to four&#13;
days before the pest information is actually available on the farms. After privatization of&#13;
FERTILITATEA, the pest forecasting system is now be operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Food (MAF).&#13;
o.    Residue Control. At the moment, five laboratories under the management of the State&#13;
Department of Sanitation and Epidemiology are capable of analyzing pesticide residues in water, air,&#13;
soils, and plant residues. The ability to analyze pesticide residues is paramount to any pest&#13;
management system in order to certify that foodstuff do not exceed the maximum residue limits in&#13;
Moldova or any importing country. The laboratory equipment, though functional, is outdated and&#13;
needs to be modernized.&#13;
C. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
9.    The Integrated Pest Management component of the project comprises several elements,&#13;
including: 1) education and extension of sustainable agriculture; and 2) pest forecasting methods, an&#13;
early warning system, and pesticide residue analysis.&#13;
[I    It was planned to support IBPP through this loan after implementing the necessary management changes at&#13;
IBPP. However, these changes have not been undertaken so far. Future projects might therefore support IBPP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CIP 3&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
10.   Extension and training center for sustainable agriculture: The Project would equip the pilot&#13;
research farm in Beltsi and the agricultural training center, supporting the MOLDAGROECO&#13;
program, in Tsaul, with farm, office, and laboratory equipment to initiate a training program for&#13;
farmers on methods of sustainable agriculture. The research farm currently uses large tractors and&#13;
machinery which are not suitable for demonstrations of sustainable farming methods in smaller, private&#13;
farms. Minibikes would be used by the extension specialists to scout fields and visit farms. The&#13;
laboratory equipment would be used for demonstration purposes.&#13;
11.   Early warning systems and pesticide residue analysis laboratories: The Project would&#13;
improve the work of the pest forecasting unit by modernizing the communications equipment at the 40&#13;
District Crop Protection Stations in order to ensure timely and accurate warnings of developing pests.&#13;
The stations would be equipped with dataloggers to record, store and transmit a number of parameters&#13;
for risk assessments of developing pests to the central forecasting unit in Chisinau. The unit would&#13;
receive technical assistance to process the information and prepare the warnings of developing pests to&#13;
farmers. The project would further re-equip two pesticide residue laboratories with modern analytical&#13;
equipment to improve the capacity and accuracy of testing for contaminations with pesticides. These&#13;
pesticide residue laboratories, located in Dondusheni and in Cagul, are managed by the Ministry of&#13;
Health's State Department of Sanitation and Epidemiology. The pesticide residue labs would routinely&#13;
perform about 5000 analysis annually per year to test for all kinds of environmental contaminants,&#13;
especially pesticides.&#13;
D. COMPONENT COSTS&#13;
12.   The base cost of the Integrated Pest Management component is estimated at $0.7 million.&#13;
Detailed cost descriptions can be found in Tables 1-4 of Attachment I to this volume of the Annexes.&#13;
E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
13.   The foreign exchange costs of this component would be financed 100% from the Bank loan,&#13;
while local costs, e.g. operation and maintenance of the equipment and facilities would be covered&#13;
through MAF.&#13;
II. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPONENT COORDINATION&#13;
14.   The Project Management Committee, through the Department for Crop Protection and&#13;
Selectsia would coordinate the activities of the implementing agencies: (a) Selectsia for the&#13;
Moldagroeco program; (b) the State Department of Sanitation and Epidemiology of the Ministry of&#13;
Health; and (c) the Ministry of Agriculture and Food's pest forecasting unit. The PMC staff would&#13;
coordinate procurement of the laboratory and other equipment for this component on the behalf of the&#13;
benefitting laboratories in MAF and the Ministry of Health.&#13;
&#13;

            The objectives of the First Agriculture
            Project are to: 1) upgrade and improve the effectiveness of
            key agricultural research programs on priority export crops
            and products; 2) strengthen institutions in priority areas:
            the agricultural knowledge system; product quality
            regulatory functions; and management in the post-privatized
            agro-processing sector; 3) develop capabilities to prepare
            sector investments and develop sector policy; and 4) develop
            project management and implementation capacity for the
            agriculture investment program. The project will comprise
            the following components: 1) agro-technology development and
            transfer consisting of viticulture and horticulture
            improvement, animal breeding and integrated pest management;
            2) institutional strengthening including studies and
            training; 3) project preparation and policy development; and
            4) project management.
