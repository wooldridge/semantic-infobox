I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR IN VENEZUELA&#13;
A. Country Overview&#13;
1. 1.  Venezuela, situated on the north coast of South America and bordered by&#13;
Colombia, Brazil and Guyana, is the continent's sixth largest country with an area&#13;
estimated at 916,442 square kilometers. In addition to its mainland, Venezuela possesses&#13;
72 islands and a maritime area of 362,000 square kilometers (the country's declared&#13;
exclusive economic zone). The total population was estimated in mid-1994 at about 21&#13;
million inhabitants, some 83% of whom live in urban areas located mainly in the northern&#13;
states. Venezuela's per capita income was estimated to be about US$ 2,760 in 1994. Oil&#13;
and several minerals account for approximately 90% of total exports. Oil production,&#13;
mining, petrochemicals and energy have in recent years generated up to 30% of Gross&#13;
Domestic Product (GDP); other manufacturing activities have accounted for another&#13;
12%, while agriculture has accounted for approximately 5% of GDP.&#13;
B. Macroeconomic Linkages&#13;
1.2.  Crisis and Reform. In Venezuela, since the late 1960s, abundant oil earnings&#13;
have traditionally accounted for 70 to 80% of govemment revenues. This has encouraged&#13;
large public spending characterized by low efficiency and low cost-recovery levels in the&#13;
public utilities sectors. In 1989, following ten years of economic decline due to falling oil&#13;
prices, deficient fiscal policy and insufficient development of non-oil activities, the&#13;
government engaged in a comprehensive structural adjustment program, including sectoral&#13;
and public administration reforms. The program included the removal of price-controls&#13;
and non-tariff barriers to trade, the liberalization of interest and foreign exchange rates and&#13;
the implementation of a schedule to increase the price of gasoline, electricity and other&#13;
public services and goods, including water. Although the program resulted in a fairly&#13;
liberalized economic environment, with an attempt to decentralize public services and&#13;
utilities (although keeping high subsidies for petroleum products), it stalled in 1992.&#13;
1.3.   The new Government, which took office in February 1994, abandoned the&#13;
liberalizing reform approach of the previous administration. In June 1994, in an attempt to&#13;
respond to an un-sustainable economic situation, foreign exchange controls were put in&#13;
place, along with other price controls, and the bolivar was fixed at a rate of 170 to the&#13;
US$. These policy changes contributed further to destabilizing the economy. Faced with&#13;
eroding oil prices, a banking sector crisis, and a resulting foreign exchange crisis, the&#13;
economy deteriorated significantly in 1994 as the fiscal deficit grew to about 14% of GDP&#13;
(including the costs incurred from the banking crisis), inflation accelerated to about 70%&#13;
and GDP contracted by about 3%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.4.   Although the Government responded with some corrective economic measures,&#13;
such as increasing premium fuel prices by 140% and opening the oil prospecting market to&#13;
foreign companies to stabilize the economy, preliminary data for 1995 indicate that the&#13;
economic performance was poor (although slightly better than in 1994): the fiscal deficit&#13;
was about 9% of GDP (including the cost associated with the banking crisis), the inflation&#13;
rate was estimated at about 60%; and GDP grew by only 2%. To stabilize the economy,&#13;
the government initiated discussions in late 1995 with the International Monetary Fund&#13;
(IMF) to formulate a comprehensive reform program. It also devalued the bolivar to 290&#13;
per US$ in December 1995. However, Venezuela's economy continued to worsen during&#13;
the first quarter of 1996: non-oil activity remained stagnant and unemployment high&#13;
(about 11 percent); financial policies have been lax (the underlying fiscal deficit has been&#13;
about 4.5 percent of GDP); and pressures on the parallel exchange rate and prices&#13;
continued to intensify--by the end of the first quarter the parallel exchange rate&#13;
represented about twice the official exchange and monthly inflation was about 8 percent in&#13;
January-February and 6 percent in March.  To correct this un-sustainable economic&#13;
situation, the Government announced on April 15 the adoption of a major reform&#13;
program, developed in consultation with the IMNF.&#13;
1.5.  Policies. Reduction of inflation and re-establishment of confidence in the economy&#13;
are the two main objectives of the reform program. To achieve these objectives, key&#13;
policies of the program include: (i) elimination of almost all controls on foreign exchange&#13;
allocation; (ii) liberalization of the exchange and interest rates; (iii) increasing gasoline&#13;
prices---by five times on average; and (iv) increasing the wholesale tax rate from 12.5&#13;
percent to 16.5 percent.  In addition, key policies to restructure the financial sector&#13;
(including the development of a banking system reform program) and to protect the most&#13;
vulnerable groups (including an extended safety net program) are being considered. The&#13;
intention is to implement these programs as soon as possible within a feasible fiscal&#13;
program.&#13;
1.6.   Prospects. As a consequence of the program, the exchange rate increased initially&#13;
to about Bs 500 per US$ (from Bs 290 in the official market as indicated above) but has&#13;
decreased to about Bs 460-470 lately. Inflation remains high, but is expected to decrease&#13;
to about 1.5 percent monthly during the second half of 1996.  For the entire year,&#13;
however, inflation is projected to reach 80 to 90 percent, the fiscal deficit is expected to be&#13;
about 2 percent of GDP (consistent with limiting the domestic borrowing requirement&#13;
from the public sector) and the economy will likely contract (-1 . 1 percent GDP growth is&#13;
predicted). To support the exchange rate, interest rates have reached positive levels in&#13;
real terms, as expected. As a consequence of both the higher real rates and economic&#13;
contraction, the financial sector will likely deteriorate further. However, by developing&#13;
and implementing a coherent financial sector reform program, the Government expects to&#13;
achieve: (i) an orderly resolution of the banking crisis within a feasible fiscal program; and&#13;
(ii) in the medium term, the emergence of a strengthened financial system. At the same&#13;
time, the recently announced economic policies together with the implementation of a&#13;
sound fiscal and monetary policy are expected to lead to a more stable economy in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
medium term (inflation is expected to decrease from the 1996 peak) growing at an average&#13;
of 4-5 % over the 1997-2000 period.&#13;
1.7.  Impact on the Sector. As a result of the structural adjustment reforms and&#13;
macroeconomic situation, investment in the water sector has decreased' from 0.18% of&#13;
GDP in the 1990-1993 period to 0.05% in 1994. Similarly it decreased from an average&#13;
of about 5% of public sector investment prior to 1989 to 2.2% since. As expected, this&#13;
reduction has had a negative impact on service coverage and quality.&#13;
1.8.   Government Strategy. The need to reduce public spending has led the&#13;
Government to seek alternative means of providing services that had been traditionally&#13;
publicly funded and heavily centralized. Inefficient pricing policies, aborted attempts at&#13;
private sector involvement, and regulatory deficiencies have contributed to make public&#13;
utilities a growing drain on national government resources. The current administration has&#13;
given high importance to the water and sanitation sector because of the acute problems in&#13;
service delivery and the heavy fiscal burden of present centralized management. The&#13;
Government's policy for the sector, articulated in a letter to the Bank (Annex A), has as its&#13;
key elements: i) accelerating the decentralization process and building local institutional&#13;
capacity for management; ii) developing a modern institutional and regulatory framework;&#13;
iii) improving cost-recovery and achieving financial self-sufficiency; iv) increasing sector&#13;
investment to an average annual 4% of total public investment, concentrating on&#13;
rehabilitation, expanded sewerage and treatment coverage and greater access by the poor&#13;
to water supply and sanitation (WS&amp;S) services; and v) improving efficiency and&#13;
involving the private sector in service delivery. The Govemment has requested World&#13;
Bank assistance in implementing the above reforms and supporting the first case of&#13;
decentralization to the state of Monagas. Project preparation work and initial actions for&#13;
institutional and regulatory reform at the national level and in the state of Monagas are&#13;
being supported through grants from the governments of Japan, Austria and Spain. The&#13;
Inter American Development Bank (IDB) is working closely with the Bank to support the&#13;
Government's sector reform efforts.&#13;
C. Sectoral Issues&#13;
1.9.   Overall Service Quality. With more than eighty percent of the urban population&#13;
receiving piped water supply, Venezuela has one of the highest coverage rates in Latin&#13;
America. It is also estimated that close to eighty percent of the rural population has&#13;
access to drinking water supply. This shows that the significant urban/rural disparities that&#13;
underlie water supply in many Latin American countries have been largely eliminated in&#13;
Venezuela. Coverage of sanitation is also high by Latin American standards, but is not as&#13;
extensive or even as that of water supply. More than sixty percent of the urban population&#13;
has connections to a sewerage system, in contrast with only forty percent of the rural&#13;
population.&#13;
See Programa de Ajuste del Sector de Agua Potable y Saneamiento, prepared by HIDROVEN in&#13;
September of 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1. 10. Despite relatively good overall coverage rates, the quality of WS&amp;S services in&#13;
Venezuela is poor, and the sector has largely failed to provide reliable and efficient&#13;
service: water supply is characterized by widespread recurring rationing during the dry&#13;
season months (however, the sector delivers 2,800 million cubic meters of water annually,&#13;
which should be sufficient to cover the national demand), low pressures, questionable&#13;
water quality, high unaccounted-for-water and inadequate customer service. Wastewaters&#13;
are generally not treated and most sewage is discharged raw into the receiving waters.&#13;
1.11. The centralized management of water and sanitation services and the treatment of&#13;
these services as a public good have resulted in very low cost recovery rates. As the&#13;
national and state governments have had to reduce their budgets in order to bring the&#13;
macroeconomic crisis under control, funding for the sector has been dramatically curtailed.&#13;
The reduction of funds has impacted on system maintenance and investment, and this in&#13;
turn has resulted in water rationing and deteriorating water quality.  Although no&#13;
significant increases in gastro-intestinal diseases have been recorded yet at the national&#13;
level, the deficient water and sewerage service is regarded as a public health problem in&#13;
states such as Monagas, where all health districts have reported increases in the incidence&#13;
of water-borne diseases.&#13;
1.12.  Sector Entities, Institutions and Regulation. The structural adjustment reforms&#13;
initiated in 1989 included the restructuring of water supply services by abolishing the&#13;
Instituto Nacional de Obras Sanitarias (INOS), decentralizing the sector to regional&#13;
agencies and establishing adequate cost-recovery policies for the sector. A new national&#13;
institution, responsible for the implementation of policy and the coordination of the sector,&#13;
C.A. Hidrol6gica Venezolana (HIDROVEN), was created in 1991. While INOS went&#13;
into liquidation, 10 regional water companies (HIiDROS) began to operate. INOS was&#13;
formally abolished in 1993, and its liquidation process is currently in its last stages.&#13;
Despite the HIDROS regional character, WS&amp;S services remain de facto highly&#13;
centralized with a complex organizational structure. The main sector entities are:&#13;
* the Ministry of the Environment and Renewable Resources (MARNR),&#13;
responsible for resources management, bulk-production of potable water,&#13;
setting policy and regulating tariffs;&#13;
a the Ministry of Development (Ministerio de Fomento), responsible for&#13;
regulating tariffs (jointly with MARNR);&#13;
*  the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance (MSAS), responsible for setting&#13;
drinking water quality standards;&#13;
*  the Municipalities, which  hold  constitutional responsibility  for water&#13;
distribution and sewerage services, although only few actually perform this&#13;
function;&#13;
*  HIDROVEN, the national water corporation (100% of the shares are owned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
by MARNR), responsible for translating sector policy into operational plans,&#13;
establishing criteria and directives for the operation, maintenance, expansion&#13;
and reconstruction of the systems and subsequently supervising compliance,&#13;
and coordinating activities in the sector;&#13;
*  the  regional water companies, HIDROS, fully-owned  subsidiaries of&#13;
HIDROVEN, which are responsible for the provision of service in one or more&#13;
states. The distribution of states among the ten HIDROS is detailed in the&#13;
table 1.1. (see also Map 1);&#13;
Table 1.1. Distribution of States among the HIDROS&#13;
HIDROS                 States under their Jurisdiction&#13;
HIDROCARIBE            Anzoategui, Monagas, Sucre and Nueva Esparta&#13;
HIDROFALCON            Falcon&#13;
HIDROCAPITAL           Distrito Federal (Caracas) and Miranda&#13;
HIDROANDES             Merida, Trujillo and part of Bannas&#13;
HIDROCENTRO            Aragua, Carabobo and Cojedes&#13;
HIDROCCIDENTAL         Lara, Yaracuy and Portuguesa&#13;
HIDROLAGO              Zulia&#13;
HIDROSUROESTE          Tachira, Municipality of Zamora and part of Barinas&#13;
HIDROPAEZ              Guarico&#13;
HIDROLLANOS            Apure&#13;
*  the Corporaci6n Venezolana de Guyana (CVG), a state-owned oil, gas and&#13;
mining company, which is responsible for providing WS&amp;S services in the&#13;
states of Bolivar, Amazonas and Amacuro; and&#13;
*  the state governments, which typically manage the rural systems in the&#13;
corresponding state.&#13;
1.13. Although sector policy formulation is the responsibility of the MARNR, this&#13;
function is normally exercised through HIDROVEN.  In practice, the sector has&#13;
functioned without clear policies and strategies. With the notable exception of potable&#13;
water quality, there have been no quality standards or performnance indicators for the&#13;
different government-owned companies that operate under the umbrella of HIDROVEN.&#13;
Moreover, there is neither an independent regulatory agency, nor a transparent and formal&#13;
regulatory framework.&#13;
1.14. Pricing Policy and Cost Recovery. On March 1, 1993, the Government issued a&#13;
Ministerial Resolution, introducing significant increases in water prices and a new tariff&#13;
structure. The Government's objective was to increase the revenues of water companies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
to achieve financial self-sufficiency (an increment of 300 to 800 % was expected), and, on&#13;
this respect, this new Resolution represented a serious effort to adjust prices to costs.&#13;
1.15. Some of the new Resolution's salient features are that it:&#13;
* imposes increasing block tariffs;&#13;
* defines 7 users categories (" residential", "residential social", "commercial",&#13;
"industrial A", " industrial B", " bulk" and " trunk delivered" ), minimum&#13;
consumption to be billed for un-metered users and six reference tariff levels2;&#13;
*  sets the water consumption (15 m3/month) to be billed to the residencial social&#13;
consumers and limits charges to them to less than 3% of the minimum salary;&#13;
.  establishes an automatic correction system  to adjust tariffs based on price&#13;
variations and on the contribution to the total cost of the system from labor,&#13;
chemicals, energy and maintenance; and&#13;
o  introduces charges for sewerage and wastewater treatment as a proportion of&#13;
the water tariff, although at an unrealistically low level (10% of water tariffs for&#13;
each sewerage and wastewater treatment).&#13;
1. 16. While this national pricing policy states that tariffs must cover operation,&#13;
maintenance, depreciation and investment, and while it incorporates an automatic&#13;
adjustment clause, it has not been applied by the local agencies of the regional water&#13;
companies. This is mainly due to the lack of incentives for the local agencies to apply a&#13;
tariff at the upper end of the set, or to bill or collect, since: (i) all collections are managed&#13;
centrally by each regional water company; (ii) deficits are substantially covered through&#13;
transfers from the national government; and (iii) local agencies operate on the basis of&#13;
monthly budgetary allocations. In addition, these agencies are subject to local political&#13;
interference and are reluctant to charge higher tariffs when the service is deteriorated.&#13;
This leads to a vicious circle by which they cannot recover the costs of improving the&#13;
system, which deteriorates further.&#13;
1. 17. As a result, overall cost-recovery remains seriously deficient, and all the regional&#13;
companies incurred operational deficits in 1994 (currently, tariffs cover only about 40% of&#13;
operational costs). The sector has financed itself largely through non-payment of its&#13;
suppliers and contractors, namely the power subsector with which it accumulated a debt of&#13;
Bs 21,800 million in the 1991-1993 period. HIDROVEN has estimated that if the sector&#13;
were to cover its operational costs, including minor maintenance, but excluding&#13;
depreciation, 1994 tariffs would have to increase two to threefold in real value. Clearly,&#13;
2  For each system, the corresponding regional water company chooses which reference tariff level to&#13;
apply, depending on their perception of customer reaction and estimated operation and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) costs (no rules on how to do this selection are provided though).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
tariffs would have to rise even more if they are to cover depreciation, debt service and a&#13;
reasonable percentage of the investment program.&#13;
1. 18. Rural Water Systems. Over the past 30 years, the management of rural water&#13;
services has undergone significant institutional and organizational transformations, with&#13;
varying degrees of decentralized and community-based management practices. In the&#13;
early 1 960s, the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance (MSAS) took responsibility for&#13;
water supply in communities with fewer than 5,000 residents. Over ten years, MSAS built&#13;
approximately 4,000 new rural water systems and established a management system&#13;
involving elected water committees in each town, payment for water services, and paid&#13;
community labor for constructing new systems. These committees drew on internal&#13;
community peer pressure and community trust to collect fees and organize group efforts&#13;
for routine repairs and maintenance. More technically complex O&amp;M was carried out by&#13;
the zone supervising engineer and his/her staff, with support from the central MSAS's&#13;
O&amp;M office in Maracay. Towards the end of the 1960s, federal transfers to cities and&#13;
towns became more common because of oil revenues, and MSAS stopped charging for&#13;
services. This brought about the decline of the water committee structure, new system&#13;
construction slowed and cost recovery measures at the local level ceased.&#13;
1.19. In the mid 1970s MSAS systems serving between 1,000 and 5,000 residents were&#13;
transferred to INOS which contracted out the O&amp;M at the state level. In 1980, INOS&#13;
began charging symbolic tariffs in some states, but collections were usually interrupted&#13;
during periods preceding elections, which reflected the political vulnerability of the system.&#13;
INOS did not charge for rural WS&amp;S services in the state of Monagas.&#13;
1.20. During the 1980s, systems managed by INOS and MSAS began to deteriorate.&#13;
Federal transfers to MSAS decreased and INOS' overriding focus on new construction to&#13;
the detriment of operation and maintenance led to the deterioration of the existing&#13;
infrastructure and contracting arrangements. In 1991, MSAS transferred all its systems to&#13;
State Public Works departments, and INOS to the regional HIDROS. In many cases, the&#13;
deficient level of rural water services provided by those two entities in each state has been&#13;
compensated by activist municipal governments, especially since mayors began being&#13;
elected, instead of appointed, in 1989. Still, rural WS&amp;S service levels remain very&#13;
uneven across the country, and billing for those services is virtually non-existent.&#13;
1.21. Water Resources Management. Although Venezuela lies entirely in the tropics,&#13;
there is considerable variation in climate due principally to differences in elevation and&#13;
topography. Average annual rainfall ranges from less than 500 mm in the north Caribbean&#13;
coast to more than 4,000 mm in parts of the Orinoco delta and the eastern part of the&#13;
Cordillera de Merida. Humidity is generally high with average values exceeding 80% in&#13;
the Amazon, eastern planes (Ilanos) and the Maracaibo lowlands. Annual average&#13;
temperatures range from 24 °C at elevations below 800 m to about 0 °C at elevations over&#13;
3,000 m. The Orinoco river system drains some 80% of the national territory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1.22. The management of water resources in Venezuela is centralized in the MARNR,&#13;
which formulates policies, sets water quality standards and controls most water-related&#13;
infrastructure (particularly water supply and sanitation investments) as well as their&#13;
operation and maintenance. Several other national, state and local agencies are also&#13;
involved in water resources management, but these operate without coordination, a&#13;
comprehensive management approach or a clear policy or strategy for integration between&#13;
them. As a result, although water policy formulation is technically the responsibility of the&#13;
MARNR, the Ministry of Agriculture and Breeding (Ministerio de Agricultura y Cria,&#13;
MAC) separately plans, constructs and manages irrigation. Similarly, although water&#13;
quality standards are established at the national level by the MARNR according to the type&#13;
of water body, MSAS sets water standards whenever issues related to the protection of&#13;
public health are involved. With respect to water supply and sanitation, some of the&#13;
MARNR's centralized control responsibilities have been delegated to HIDROVEN when&#13;
sector restructuring and decentralization began in 1990.&#13;
1.23. As part of the sector restructuring initiative, the government of Venezuela created&#13;
two river basin commissions in 1993 to decentralize and coordinate water resources&#13;
management in the Tuy River and Lake Valencia. However, these have failed to meet the&#13;
objectives set for them: they have not achieved sustainability and they have remained fully&#13;
financially dependent on the MARNR. The commissions were created following a new&#13;
institutional construct to address problems of water and the environment with a more&#13;
decentralized approach, where public participation was presented as a key component of&#13;
the institutional framework (public meetings were indeed held in the basins to involve&#13;
stakeholders in some planning decisions).  However, the decision-making has been&#13;
maintained at the national level in the MARNR. Moreover, the basin's stakeholders have&#13;
not been properly involved in their management and have remain un-bound to financial&#13;
requirements or decisions.&#13;
1.24. Project Focus on Sectoral Issues at the National Level. To address the issues&#13;
described above, the proposed project contains a national institutional component (para&#13;
3.10) which will support the Government's efforts to develop a new institutional and&#13;
regulatory framework for the sector, create and/or strengthen sector national institutions&#13;
and finance studies, equipment and consultant services to develop and implement new&#13;
policies on shared water resources management and related infrastructure, rural water&#13;
systems management, and private sector participation in water services delivery.&#13;
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.25. Past Bank involvement in Venezuela. Between 1961 and 1992, the Bank&#13;
approved 23 loans to Venezuela, totaling US$ 2,425.2 million. The FY 1992 lending&#13;
program amounted to US$ 329 million. The Bank reduced lending to a " core" program&#13;
of no more than US$ 200 million/year for FY94-95, owing to a deterioration in the&#13;
macroeconomic framework, with the proviso that lending could only be increased should a&#13;
number of macroeconomic conditions be met. The core program will target human&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
resources, institutional stref-thening, and infrastructure rehabilitation with emphasis on&#13;
poverty alleviation and privatization. The project focuses on these target interventions.&#13;
1.26. Bank Strategy. According to the last Country Assistance Strategy presented to&#13;
the Executive Directors on November 4, 19933, the Bank has five strategic objectives in&#13;
Venezuela: (a) advance the structural reform process and improve macroeconomic&#13;
management; (b) strengthen human resource development and poverty alleviation&#13;
programs; (c) strengthen government institutions at the central and local levels, including&#13;
project preparation and implementation capacity; (d) reform and rehabilitate key&#13;
infrastructure sectors; and (e) promote privatization and private sector development.&#13;
Efforts in the infrastructure sectors consistent with these objectives seek to: (a) strengthen&#13;
the ministerial, state and local units charged with designing and implementing strategies&#13;
and programs; (b) deregulate and reform pricing and cost-recovery mechanisms (including&#13;
independent regulatory bodies) for publicly supplied goods and services; (c) implement&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation programs; and (d) make progress on decentralization,&#13;
restructuring, and privatization.  The project is fully consistent with the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy and will contribute to the achievement of these strategic objectives&#13;
and efforts.&#13;
1.27. The Bank's last strategy for the WS&amp;S sector, elaborated in the report Venezuela:&#13;
Strategy Paper for the Infrastructure Sectors (Report No. 11605-VE, 1993), remains&#13;
valid. The strategy focuses on supporting the Government's efforts to change the role of&#13;
the public sector and to create a regulatory framework that ensures effective competition.&#13;
A major goal for the operating agencies will be improved technical, administrative,&#13;
commercial, and financial efficiency with increased participation, where feasible, of the&#13;
private sector. The Bank's assistance to the water sector in Venezuela is envisaged&#13;
through three lending operations: (a) the proposed project, designed to help initiate the&#13;
sector decentralization in Monagas, serve as a demonstration model for other state water&#13;
companies, and assist HIDROVEN in further defining its role as the institution that will&#13;
lead policy changes at the national level and support the preparation of similar projects in&#13;
other states; (b) a project to support the rehabilitation and institutional modernization of&#13;
WS&amp;S services for Caracas; and (c) a sector-wide operation to replicate in other states&#13;
the model developed in Monagas and address growing water pollution problems,&#13;
particularly in urban areas. These operations would be supported by previous and ongoing&#13;
sector analysis, and by experience gained under this project.&#13;
3  A new Country Assistance Strategy is under preparation, which will reflect recent agreements&#13;
between the Government and the IMEF on macroeconomic policy, as well as the continued high&#13;
priority of decentralization, improved management of public services through private sector&#13;
participation and strengthened cost-recovery, and better access to these services by the poor under&#13;
participatory management schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Reformulation Loan (PERL) (Ln 3223-VE) supported the Government's plans to initiate&#13;
sector decentralization by abolishing INOS and creating the regional water companies.&#13;
The project had mixed results, partly due to the volatile political environment which&#13;
predominated in 1992-93, and partly because the strategy of enterprise reform rather than&#13;
sector reform left some important issues unresolved: in the case of the water sector, the&#13;
project did not put in place a strengthened regulatory framework or improved prices. This&#13;
had direct consequences for the privatization of the Caracas water system, which the&#13;
PERL had set out to support. A combination of factors, including an unfavorable&#13;
regulatory framework, a lack of local political commitment and consensus on objectives,&#13;
and excessively low existing tariffs, caused the concessioning process to abort. Although&#13;
the bid was unsuccessful, the basic preparatory work is still relevant for any future reform&#13;
and private sector involvement in the Caracas WS&amp;S system and in the sector as a whole.&#13;
1.29. This experience, and a review of sector experience in the LAC Region and Bank-&#13;
wide (Annex B), suggest that there are essential requirements for efficient and effective&#13;
WS&amp;S services. They include:&#13;
*  an adequate regulatory framework and, linked to it, appropriate tariff levels&#13;
and billing and collection mechanisms to generate the funds needed for&#13;
financial autonomy and to signal the real cost of water to the consumers. The&#13;
projects intends to develop these instruments through the national institutional&#13;
component (para 3.10);&#13;
*  efficient and cost-conscious management to avoid unnecessary expenditures,&#13;
particularly in excess personnel. Decentralizing the services now provided by&#13;
HIDROCARIBE and contracting the management of the services to an&#13;
experienced private operator should achieve this requirement,&#13;
* reversing the preference of decision-makers for new capital expenditure over&#13;
proper operation and maintenance. The project's physical works concentrate&#13;
on rehabilitation, the minimization of physical and commercial water losses and&#13;
the correction of deferred maintenance as a means of postponing new&#13;
investment and improving efficiency; and&#13;
*  user involvement in the setting of priorities and, where possible, the design of&#13;
subprojects, to improve ownership and cost-sharing of operation and&#13;
maintenance functions.  The project preparation has included thorough&#13;
stakeholder consultation, and taken into account demand-based, participatory&#13;
models already tested in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
II. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
A. Introduction and Overview&#13;
2.1.  The state of Monagas, located in the north-east of Venezuela, covers an area of&#13;
28,900 KM2, which represents 3.17% of the national territory.  In 1994, it had a&#13;
population of approximately 540,000, about 2.6% of the country's population. It is&#13;
divided into thirteen municipalities: Acosta, Bolivar, Caripe, Cedeflo, Ezequiel Zamora,&#13;
Libertador, Maturin, Piar, Punceres, Sotillo, Aguasay, Santa Barbara, and Uracoa. The&#13;
largest municipality, Maturin, is the state's capital, has approximately 65% of the state's&#13;
population and has been growing at a high rate of over 6.7% per annum in the last ten&#13;
years due to the activity of the petroleum industry. Other municipalities (Ezequiel&#13;
Zamora, Libertador and Sotillo) are also estimated to grow at between 2 and 5 percent per&#13;
year while the rural population has been decreasing at about 1-3 percent yearly. Roughly&#13;
15% (about 80,000 people) of the Monagas population live in rural areas. The state's&#13;
economy is based on: (i) the petroleum industry, which produces 800,000 barrels of oil&#13;
and 1,200 million cubic feet of gas daily; (ii) agriculture, with the production of corn,&#13;
sorghum, soya, caraotas (black beans), pineapple, mango, bananas, oil palm, yuca,&#13;
coffee, cocoa, and sugar cane; and (iii) cattle rearing.&#13;
2.2.  There is some degree of community organization in the state of Monagas, and this&#13;
provides a favorable vehicle for community and user participation in project design,&#13;
operation and supervision. Each municipality is organized into parishes, and these in turn&#13;
generally have several neighborhood associations. The Parish Council members are&#13;
elected by popular vote in a process similar to the election of the municipal governments.&#13;
The neighborhood associations are formed spontaneously and their members are chosen&#13;
in accordance with the by-laws of the association. There are 34 parishes in Monagas, in&#13;
addition to the 13 municipalities. The Parish Council supports the Municipal Council in&#13;
the administration of the municipality. The neighborhood associations do not have&#13;
regulated functions; they seek to promote the interests of each neighborhood.&#13;
B. Organization of the Sector in Monagas&#13;
2.3.   Introduction.  Until 1995, HIDROCARIBE provided water and sanitation&#13;
services in most urban areas of the state and in 22 communities designated as rural. The&#13;
state government is responsible for service in an additional 190 rural communities.&#13;
HIDROCARIBE also served 3 other states (Nueva Esparta, Anzoategui, and Sucre)&#13;
through separate management and accounting-centers for each state. The one operating&#13;
in Monagas was known as HIDROCARIBE-Monagas, and although it had well-defined&#13;
functions and responsibilities, it had no financial or administrative autonomy.  In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
particular, it did not manage the funds that it collected, as these were transferred to&#13;
HIDROCARIBE's head office located in Puerto La Cruz in the state of Anzoategui.&#13;
2.4.  Service Quality and Coverage. It is estimated by HIDROVEN that in 1994,&#13;
93% of the urban population of Monagas had access to piped water supply, while 59%&#13;
had access to sewerage services. Coverage varied from a high of 95% in Maturin to a low&#13;
of 60% in Caripe, for water, and a high of 80% in Temblador and Barrancas to a low of&#13;
40% in Caripe, for sewerage. Water quality is deficient, and the incidence of water-&#13;
related diseases treated in local hospitals is quite large. In addition, sewage is mainly&#13;
discharged untreated into the rivers, although there are some small, poorly maintained&#13;
oxidation lagoons and some small, privately-owned treatment plants. Managerial and&#13;
system inefficiencies have combined to produce very high unaccounted-for water levels,&#13;
estimated by HIDROVEN at roughly 70% of the water produced. Moreover, significant&#13;
rationing is normal during the dry months. The response to this situation has traditionally&#13;
consisted in drilling wells to increase water supply. Four wells, drilled by a petroleum&#13;
company and subsequently abandoned, have recently been reconditioned to add some 150&#13;
lps (liters per second). Similarly, seven additional wells are being drilled with the&#13;
assistance of CORPOVEN - one of the three government-owned oil companies - and are&#13;
expected to add some 210 lps before the dry season of 1996.&#13;
2.5.  Operating  Practices  and  Commercial and  Financial Performance.&#13;
HIDROCARIBE, as most regional water companies have done since their creation, relied&#13;
on private sector companies (operadoras) to provide the service and operate and maintain&#13;
the system, while undertaking directly all commercial and administrative functions.&#13;
Because the contracts used to hire the operadoras were of short duration and were not&#13;
performance-based, they became "force-account" contracts, whereby a private party&#13;
provides personnel and equipment at a given rate, with no responsibility for cost or&#13;
performance. To further complicate matters, the financial situation of the sector did not&#13;
allow HIDROCARIBE to pay the operadoras on time. As a result, the operadoras were&#13;
not complying fully with their contractual responsibilities.&#13;
2.6.  The contracts with the operadoras allowed HIDROCARIBE to reduce its number&#13;
of employees and as a result, in 1994 HIDROCARIBE and HIDROCARIBE-Monagas&#13;
employed only 597 and 75 persons, between administrators and technical staff,&#13;
respectively. However, if the personnel provided by the operadoras is added, the number&#13;
of employees increased to 2,019 and 250, respectively, which led to 9 and 6 employees&#13;
per 1,000 customers, a figure higher than what is common in well-run utilities'.&#13;
2.7.  HIDROCARIBE-Monagas had an unsatisfactory financial performance since it&#13;
began operating in 1991. The main reasons for this bad performance were: (i) inadequate&#13;
tariffs and lack of financial resources that resulted in excessive dependence on transfers&#13;
from HIDROCARIBE; (ii) very high unaccounted-for water levels, inadequate billing and&#13;
The number of employees per 1,000 connections is 3.6 in Bogota, 2.1 in Santiago 2.9 in average in the&#13;
United States and as low as 0.8 in Alicante (Spain).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
collections practices and inappropriate commercial policies; (iii) inconsistent accounting&#13;
practices; (iv) lack of clearly defined sectoral and operational objectives and&#13;
responsibilities; (v) deficient planning and control; (vi) lack of corporate independence,&#13;
managerial autonomy and accountability; (vii) insufficient qualified management and&#13;
technical staff, inadequate salary levels and excessive staffing in low level echelons; (viii)&#13;
insufficient maintenance of the infrastructure in operation, that has resulted in rationing,&#13;
averaging 4.5 days per week during the dry season, and (ix) inefficient procurement of the&#13;
operadoras' services.&#13;
2.8.  In 1994, HIDROCARIBE-Monagas served an estimated 60,900 connections, of&#13;
which 41,658 figured in its roster as clients (additionally, the state government supplied&#13;
about 12,000 connections in the urban areas, mainly in Maturin). These were billed a&#13;
total of Bs 330 million and of those, Bs 230 million were effectively collected. The&#13;
company's operation and maintenance expenditure was Bs 630 million, of which Bs 245&#13;
million were not paid, mostly for electricity supply and services provided by the&#13;
operadoras, that were added to a growing figure of payable accounts. Since there was in&#13;
effect no policy for disconnecting clients for non-payment of the service, and no&#13;
incentives to introduce adequate cost management procedures, the financial situation&#13;
would have continued to be grossly inadequate in the absence of corrective measures.&#13;
2.9.  The available financial information reveals that the rate of return was -25% for&#13;
1993 and -14% for 1994. The key standard indicators (operational, cash-flow and&#13;
balance sheet) also show HIDROCARIBE-Monagas' meager performance. In this period&#13;
gross revenues were insufficient to fund cash expenses, demanding a Government&#13;
subsidy of Bs 250 million in 1993 and Bs 490 million in 1994 to finance the operating&#13;
deficit. Central Government subsidies for new investments were also needed during the&#13;
period, and they reached Bs 870 and 892 million in 1993 and 1994.&#13;
2.10. Local Reforms in the Sector. In the context of the proposed project, authorities at&#13;
the state and municipal level in Monagas, supported by HIDROVEN, initiated steps to&#13;
improve the service and further decentralize it. The Ley Orgdnica de Regimen Municipal&#13;
includes water and sanitation services as part of the municipalities' duties and&#13;
responsibilities. To this end, the Mayors of the ten municipalities in the state created on&#13;
September 21, 1992 the Mancomunidad Monaguense de Acueductos (Mancomunidad), in&#13;
essence an association of municipalities, to deal with WS&amp;S services management and&#13;
operation in the state. On October 26, 1993, the state government and the Mancomunidad&#13;
created Aguas de Monagas (AdM), to act as the responsible operating company for the&#13;
services in substitution of HIDROCARIBE in the state of Monagas. The capital structure of&#13;
AdM is public and comprises a 51% equity share from the Mancomunidad, with the&#13;
remainder held by the state government. Under this structure, O&amp;M as well as management&#13;
fimctions will be contracted to the private sector, while AdM staffing is limited to the core&#13;
management which is needed for support to the Board of Directors and for project&#13;
implementation. Two members of AdM's five person Board of Directors are appointed&#13;
by the Governor and represent the state and the other three represent the municipalities.&#13;
At the request of the Governor and the Mancomunidad, CORPOVEN is assisting AdM by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
2.11. The project will assist AdM, through a regional component (para 3.9 a and b), in&#13;
facing several key challenges: (i) urgently rehabilitating physical infrastructure that has&#13;
been seriously deteriorated due to neglected maintenance, in order to provide reliable&#13;
service and improve water quality; and (ii) strengthening its institutional and comnercial&#13;
capacity, introducing metering and involving the private sector in service management&#13;
through a management contract that will be structured with the appropriate incentives for&#13;
improved service delivery and cost-recovery. For the latter objective, AdM, with the help&#13;
of the private operator, should tap its potential revenue stream and increase revenue from&#13;
the very modest US$ 1.1 million in 1994 (about US$ 15 per connection per year), through&#13;
better billing and collection procedures, reduction of the present high unaccounted-for-&#13;
water level and adequate tariff adjustments.&#13;
2.12. Metering, Billing and Collection. AdM's main problems at this point appear to&#13;
be the high unaccounted-for-water levels, billing deficiencies and accounts receivable&#13;
inherited from HLDROCARIBE. In 1994, it was estimated that unaccounted-for water&#13;
reached 70% and was due primarily to: (i) the accumulated effects of inadequate&#13;
maintenance practices; (ii) unmetered customers and damaged meters (of a total of about&#13;
41,000 clients, only 1,200 (1.5%) have meters working properly), and (iii) the large&#13;
number of users, estimated to be about 30,000, who do not appear in the client roster and&#13;
therefore are never billed. Information provided by HIDROCARIBE-Monagas indicates&#13;
that in 1993 and 1994 collections were 34% and 56% of the amounts billed, respectively.&#13;
Although this shows some improvement, much remains to be done in this area. This&#13;
positive trend is continuing, as AdM has been able to double the amount collected since it&#13;
took over commercial operations from HIDROCARIBE in July 1995, in the context of&#13;
project preparation.&#13;
2.13. Tariff Levels. In 1994, HlDROCARIBE-Monagas' residential reference tariff&#13;
was Bs 17.5 per cubic meter of water for residential consumers (Bs 7.5/m3 for residencial&#13;
social), an extremely low figure by any standard. Since there are only a few metered&#13;
connections, consumption levels are estimated and the average revenue is therefore&#13;
unreliable and must be even lower. In practice, HIDROCARIBE-Monagas chooses which&#13;
tariffs to apply from the six tariff levels included in the current Ministerial Resolution on&#13;
tariffs, normally after they have been negotiated with the Mayors. Tariff policy is erratic at&#13;
best, and non-existent at worst. It is expected that AdM will require financial support&#13;
from the municipal and state governments through 1998, until unaccounted-for water&#13;
levels, billing and accounts receivable and tariffs are brought in line with sound utility&#13;
practice. During project preparation, tariffs have already been raised from 17.5 Bs/m3 to&#13;
40 Bs/m3 to reflect the cost of providing the service, and they will be further increased to&#13;
60 Bs/m3 before project effectiveness (para 5.1 a and 5.3 b). Additional adjustments due&#13;
to the recent devaluation and continuing high inflation are incorporated in the company's&#13;
financial plan, developed during project preparation. For this analysis, a cost-structure&#13;
similar to that of HIDROCARIBE has been assumed, with increments in the cost of labor,&#13;
energy, chemicals and operation and maintenance contracts determined by the year's&#13;
internal inflation. These increments have been used for the calculation of the reference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
incorporated in the company's financial plan, developed during project preparation. For&#13;
this analysis, a cost-structure similar to that of HIDROCARIBE has been assumed, with&#13;
increments in the cost of labor, energy, chemicals and operation and maintenance&#13;
contracts determined by the year's internal inflation. These increments have been used&#13;
for the calculation of the reference residential tariff adjustments, in application of the&#13;
current ministerial resolution that regulates this matter. It is expected, however, that&#13;
improved management practices provided through the private operator would result in&#13;
more efficient Operation and Maintenance contracts.&#13;
2.14. Rural Systems. Rural WS&amp;S systems in the state of Monagas are managed&#13;
either by the state government (generally the smaller systems, usually run by individually&#13;
contracted operators who are poorly trained), or HIDROCARIBE (larger systems, serving&#13;
about 800 households on average each), which contracts out the operation of the rural&#13;
systems to five operating companies, each covering a separate region of the state. Rural&#13;
water supply coverage is high, but the reliability of service is deficient (generally&#13;
intermittent and with prolonged periods of interruption). Moreover, most systems do not&#13;
treat water for potability and water quality varies widely among rural communities,&#13;
leading to adverse health impacts. These conditions stem from several critical problems:&#13;
i) inadequate supervision of operators, due to the isolation of rural systems from the&#13;
central management unit in Maturin; ii) little or no water treatment or water quality&#13;
monitoring; iii) poorly designed wells and/or water systems; iv) insufficient water&#13;
supplies;  vii) insufficient funding and lack of timely payment for repairs and&#13;
maintenance; and viii) lack of involvement of rural communities with the system's O&amp;M&#13;
and planning. However, discussions held with rural communities representatives during&#13;
project preparation have indicated that communities would be interested in a scheme&#13;
involving them more in the management of their WS&amp;S services.&#13;
2.15. The project will assist AdM and the municipalities to address the current problems&#13;
affecting the rural WS&amp;S systems and channel the interest of the communities to get&#13;
involved in the management of their WS&amp;S services. To this end, the project's regional&#13;
component includes a sub-component (para 3.9 c) to develop a pilot Rural Rehabilitation&#13;
and Participatory Management Program (Programa Participativo de Mejoramiento de&#13;
Acueductos Rurales - PROPAMAR), to:  (i) provide financial support for the&#13;
improvement of these systems; (ii) create management capacity at the community level;&#13;
and (iii) pilot decentralized and participatory management of rural water systems in the&#13;
state of Monagas and test policies and procedures that could be replicated in the rest of&#13;
the country.&#13;
2.16. Water Resources Management. In Monagas, several important problems of&#13;
water quantity and quality are being compounded by the combination of a growing&#13;
pressure on water resources and the divided responsibilities among managing institutions,&#13;
limited regulatory structure, lack of adequate institutional capacity and weak financial&#13;
incentives to implement water resources planning and management. Although the&#13;
creation of AdM is a step towards providing a more reliable and efficient municipal water&#13;
service, it does not addresses the allocation and protection of water resources in the state,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
that is highly centralized in the MARNR. To tackle this problem and develop policies&#13;
and experience that could be replicated in other parts of the country, the project's national&#13;
institutional component will support the development and introduction of integrated water&#13;
resource management in the state of Monagas and the creation of a decentralized&#13;
watershed management unit for the Amana and Guarapiche rivers, with significant&#13;
involvement of the basin's stakeholders (para 3.10 a).&#13;
2.17. Legal and Regulatory Issues. During project preparation, the Government, with&#13;
the assistance of the Bank, developed a series of contract and agreements to address the&#13;
shortcomings of the current regulatory, legal and institutional framework of the sector and&#13;
solve legal issues that could represent constraints for project implementation and for the&#13;
proper operation of AdM, mainly those related to the decentralization of the service to the&#13;
municipalities. These contracts and agreements (para 3.14) will complement the current&#13;
regulatory and institutional framework in an interim basis, until a new, more developed,&#13;
framework is in place. The legal issues included: (i) AdM's legal status; (ii) the&#13;
assignment of the responsibility for the provision of WS&amp;S services and the production&#13;
of water - the latter a national government responsibility;  (iii) the authority and&#13;
procedures for setting and adjusting tariffs; and (iv) the mechanisms to channel funds for&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
2.18. These contracts and agreements define and regulate the relationships among the&#13;
Government of Venezuela, MARNR, HIDROCARIBE, the State of Monagas&#13;
(Gobernaci6n), the Municipalities and AdM. At the same time, these arrangements will&#13;
serve as a demonstration and test exercise to help define requirements of the new&#13;
regulatory framework under preparation. Annex C describes in detail each of these issues&#13;
and the resulting legal agreements that will enable the Govermment to move forward with&#13;
this demonstration decentralization project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin&#13;
3.1.   At the national level, the project originates from the WS&amp;S decentralization and&#13;
restructuring policy expressed in the Government's overall sector strategy. This is based&#13;
on the concept of separation of the ownership, operation and regulatory functions and on&#13;
the involvement of stakeholders in the planning and decision activities. It is also based on&#13;
fostering the efficient participation of private operators in the sector by providing a&#13;
transparent and equitable regulatory framework and developing experiences and policies&#13;
that could facilitate this participation. These principles have been fully embraced by&#13;
HIDROVEN and by the regional and local authorities of the state of Monagas.&#13;
3.2.  At the level of the state of Monagas, the project origin can be traced to the demand&#13;
of state and local authorities for the decentralization of sector management and for the&#13;
transfer of WS&amp;S services to the municipalities, with the creation of AdM and the transfer&#13;
of responsibilities from HIDROCARIBE to AdM. This arrangement has been very&#13;
effective and has helped to create a decisive consensus among involved stakeholders, users&#13;
and institutions.&#13;
3.3.   The state of Monagas was selected to put in place the first effective&#13;
decentralization of the WS&amp;S services and to introduce efficiency reforms aimed at&#13;
achieving improved service delivery and financial self sufficiency, under a demonstration&#13;
project. Monagas was chosen because: (i) there is a high degree of political commnitment&#13;
by the state government and municipalities to decentralization; (ii) WS&amp;S services in the&#13;
state are in practice contained within the states borders; (iii) these services have a large&#13;
potential for improvement and the demand and willingness to pay for them among the&#13;
population seemed sufficient to warrant support for the process; and (iv) most important&#13;
rivers for WS&amp;S start and discharge into the sea within the state, making feasible and&#13;
coherent with the decentralization approach of the project, the solution of problems&#13;
related to the management and allocation of water resources. Project identification was&#13;
initiated in January 1993 but significant project preparation activities only began in January&#13;
1995 after the approval of the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development grant&#13;
and additional support from the Austrian and Spanish governments was secured.&#13;
3.4.   Participatory approach. During project preparation, two formal workshops and&#13;
several other informal meetings were held with project stakeholders, including&#13;
representatives from the Governor's office, the Municipalities, HIDROVEN, AdM, the&#13;
Juntas Parroquiales, industry and commerce associations, and local consulting firms&#13;
involved in the project. In those workshops, stakeholders endorsed the project concept&#13;
and its design. In particular, they supported the need for a Contract Plan among AdM and&#13;
its stockholders to spell out targets and responsibilities and for a performance-based&#13;
management contract for AdM  with a private operator.  They also endorsed the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
conditionality to be included in the operation to ensure its success and showed their&#13;
understanding for the need to improve commercial practices and undertake tariff&#13;
adjustments.&#13;
3.5.   Two willingness to pay studies were also carried out, one among households in&#13;
Maturin and another among rural communities. These were preceded by meetings with&#13;
focus groups, each with ten to twenty participants from different neighborhoods&#13;
corresponding to different socioeconomic backgrounds. These meetings were aimed at&#13;
collecting preliminary information on users' opinions and level of satisfaction with the&#13;
service quality, alternative water supply sources (e.g. private back-up arrangements),&#13;
billing and collection procedures and amounts spent by household on water and other&#13;
public services. Participants were also given the opportunity to react to the proposed&#13;
institutional and service changes planned under the project and to trial tariffs which could&#13;
be charged under the improved scheme. These studies and the meetings with the focus&#13;
groups have proven essential to: (i) measure and promote demand for the project among&#13;
the population, (ii) identify the main elements used to define the project design; (iii)&#13;
establish support among local policy-makers for a more rigorous approach to WS&amp;S&#13;
services management that relies on user's contribution;  (iv) ratify tariff increase&#13;
recommendations resulting from the financial analyses carried out during project&#13;
preparation; and (v) determine rural communities' valuation of and willingness to share&#13;
investment and O&amp;M costs for improved water systems. These studies also added much&#13;
needed light on customer concerns over current service and on preferences and priorities&#13;
for the future improvements to the system, thereby providing policy-makers and the&#13;
project preparation team with a clear sense of the priorities to be addressed.&#13;
3.6.   Additionally, local and national NGOs have been consulted about the project and,&#13;
as a result of these consultations, NGOs will be incorporated in the project execution, both&#13;
as facilitators of the actions and investments in rural areas and as part of the independent&#13;
evaluators of the project success and of the degree of achievement of its objectives.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.7.   The project's principal objective is to increase the efficiency and quality of WS&amp;S&#13;
services in Venezuela through the development of a model for decentralization,&#13;
institutional strengthening, and expanded private sector participation. The project has&#13;
three specific objectives: (a) assist in the strengthening of AdM, develop its financial self-&#13;
sufficiency, and involve the private sector in the management and operation of the&#13;
company; (b) rehabilitate and improve the quality of WS&amp;S services in Monagas; and (c)&#13;
support sector development and decentralization at the national level, including water&#13;
resources management. As a demonstration operation, the project will implement sector&#13;
reforms in the state of Monagas that could be replicated in other states and will strengthen&#13;
HIDROVEN's capacity to provide assistance to that effect. The project was selected over&#13;
other alternatives which would have attempted reform of the sector more rapidly and&#13;
broadly, because the Government wants to test innovative approaches on a small scale,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
and because state and local authorities in Monagas are highly motivated to improve water&#13;
utility performance.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.8.   The project includes two components to finance:  (I) regional institutional&#13;
strengthening and investment in rehabilitating the existing WS&amp;S systems in the State of&#13;
Monagas to improve quality and efficiency of service delivery;  and (2) national&#13;
institutional strengthening. A summarized description of each of these components is&#13;
presented below. A more detailed description is included in Annexes E through I.&#13;
The Regional Component&#13;
3.9.   This component seeks to strengthen AdM  and rehabilitate the existing WS&amp;S&#13;
infrastructure. It would include the following:&#13;
(a)   Institutional strengthening and support to AdM. This would finance: (i)&#13;
contracting of management consultant services with a private operator (see annex&#13;
E);  (ii) equipment, consultant services and systems to improve commercial&#13;
practices, supervise the management contract, promote private sector participation&#13;
(including assistance in the bidding process for a concession or lease contract), and&#13;
execution of a public information campaign, a survey of customer satisfaction and&#13;
the use of a local NGO for the evaluation of the project success;  and (iii)&#13;
engineering consultant services to prepare an improvement and expansion plan for&#13;
the water and sewerage systems, including the final design of the rehabilitation&#13;
works to be financed under this project and the design of a preventive maintenance&#13;
program.&#13;
(b)   Rehabilitation in urban areas. This would finance the rehabilitation of the&#13;
WS&amp;S services in the urban areas and some expansion in marginal areas. The&#13;
selection of these investments has been based on least-cost criteria and on a set of&#13;
priorities and objectives agreed with AdM and its stakeholders during project&#13;
preparation (see Annex F for further details). Agreements were confirmed during&#13;
negotiations on the selection and grouping of the investments in urban areas into&#13;
three rehabilitation packages consisting of. (i) emergency works; (ii) priority&#13;
rehabilitation works for the first two years, to be conditioned on the signing of the&#13;
management contract with the private operator;  and (iii) works for the&#13;
improvement of service quality, to be conditioned on the achievement of Contract&#13;
Plan targets (para 5.2 b):&#13;
* The first rehabilitation package will finance emergency works required to&#13;
avoid the physical collapse of the urban water supply systems, correct the&#13;
principal water losses and water quality problems and help lessen acute water&#13;
shortages that have had an important negative impact on customers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
satisfaction. To this end, the emergency investments will be concentrated in&#13;
the improvement and rehabilitation of the pumping systems, in the&#13;
interconnection of the networks, in the correction of the most important water&#13;
losses and-in the provision of basic and reliable disinfection. These investments&#13;
will be contracted and carried out before project effectiveness, following&#13;
procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank to be eligible for retroactive&#13;
financing. Engineering designs and bidding documents for these investments&#13;
have been prepared with funds provided by a grant from the Austrian&#13;
government and by the state government.&#13;
* The second rehabilitation package will finance priority rehabilitation works,&#13;
mainly focused on the reduction of unaccounted-for-water and improvements&#13;
of the system efficiency that are expected to have a great incidence in&#13;
customer's satisfaction, in the reliability of the service and in the financial&#13;
situation of AdM. This second package is expected to be completed within the&#13;
first two years of project execution, before the mid-term review.&#13;
* The third rehabilitation package will finance works for the improvement of&#13;
service quality and some expansion of coverage in marginal areas. It will&#13;
include the rehabilitation and improvement of potable water production&#13;
infrastructure, the rehabilitation and expansion of water distribution and&#13;
sewerage networks and the rehabilitation and improvement of existing&#13;
wastewater management infrastructure.&#13;
(c)   Institutional development and rehabilitation of rural water systems. To&#13;
support the development of the PROPAMAR, this subcomponent would finance&#13;
investments and technical assistance to improve rural WS&amp;S services and create&#13;
management capacity at the community level. The investments will include civil&#13;
works, equipment and materials for the improvement and some expansion of these&#13;
systems to provide a basic level of service defined as an in-house connection for&#13;
every household, 150 liters per capita per day availability; and potable water.&#13;
Rural WS&amp;S systems in approximately 85 communities covering about 45,000&#13;
inhabitants (about 50 % of the state's rural population) are expected to be financed&#13;
over four years under this subcomponent. The technical assistance will finance the&#13;
coordination and administration of the PROPAMAR by AdM, through the services&#13;
of a non-governmental organization (NGO)' which will: (i) carry out a campaign&#13;
to promote the proposed program; (ii) assist communities in organizing and&#13;
identifying their needs, preparing a proposal in the form of a Community Water&#13;
Action Plan (COWAP) and building up their capacity to take over the management&#13;
of their rural water system using commercial practices; and (iii) help Municipalities&#13;
build capacity to take over technical assistance to communities once the NGO&#13;
withdraws (see annex G for further details).&#13;
This includes the possibility of contracting the services of a consulting firm, since the contract will be&#13;
awarded through a competitive bidding process. All further references to "the NGO" in this&#13;
document should be understood to include a consulting firm as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
The National Institutional Component&#13;
3.10.  The national institutional component will finance consultant services, equipment&#13;
and training to assist and promote the modernization of the Venezuelan water supply and&#13;
sanitation sector.  It will support:  (i) implementation of the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework proposal under preparation for the sector; (ii) creation and/or strengthening of&#13;
national sector institutions; (iii) increasing technical, managerial and monitoring capacity&#13;
at the national, as well as local level to regulate, plan and operate these services; (iv)&#13;
meetings, workshops and a public awareness campaign to stimulate a broad social support&#13;
for the modernization of WS&amp;S and the rational use of the water resources; (v) preparing&#13;
training and dissemination materials; and (vi) facilitating the preparation of at least four&#13;
projects to duplicate the model developed in Monagas.  The national institutional&#13;
component will consist of four subcomponents, three to support the Technical Assistance&#13;
Program, National Training Program and Sector Decentralization Program, respectively,&#13;
and one to finance consultant support to HIDROVEN to manage the component and&#13;
overall project coordination and evaluation activities (see Annex H for further details):&#13;
(a)    The Technical Assistance Program  subcomponent will assist in the&#13;
implementation of the legal and regulatory framework which is currently under&#13;
design with support from a PHRD Grant from the Government of Japan and from&#13;
the Bank. It will finance consultant services and equipment for:&#13;
*  institutional strengthening of national sector institutions (HIDROVEN&#13;
and the regulatory agency or agencies to be defined), including: (i) a&#13;
study to define the organizational structure of the sector according to&#13;
the proposed Regulatory Framework; (ii) technical assistance; and (iii)&#13;
implementation of a management information system in HIDROVEN&#13;
and preparation of an inventory of basic sectoral information needed to&#13;
plan, regulate and provide technical assistance to sector institutions;&#13;
*  preparation of sectoral norms and standards; and&#13;
*  development and implementation of policies for: (i) management of&#13;
shared water resources and related infrastructure; (ii) management of&#13;
rural water systems and (iii) institutional organization and promotion of&#13;
private sector participation.&#13;
Additionally, this subcomponent will finance studies, equipment and related&#13;
consulting services to support the design, creation and functioning of a Users'&#13;
Hydrographic Confederation (CHU) for the management of water resources in the&#13;
Amana and Guarapiche river basins, in the state of Monagas, as a demonstration&#13;
case.  The design will be based on the idea that effective water resources&#13;
management is best achieved through an organization that:  (i) is given the&#13;
authority to establish and implement a water resources plan; (ii) meets the goal of&#13;
financial sustainability;  and (iii) is locally based, represents the users and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
stakeholders in a river basin and responds to and is financially dependent on them.&#13;
Since the main role of the CHU will be to develop and implement management&#13;
criteria and principles to plan for the allocation and protection of water resources&#13;
in this area, this sub-component will also provide support to the CHU to develop a&#13;
basic information systems for these river basins, prepare a management plan and&#13;
set up the necessary institutional capacity to implement it (see Annex I for further&#13;
details). Preliminary work to design the CHU has been carried out with the help of&#13;
a grant from the Spanish government. Assurances have been obtained that a&#13;
reform proposal and implementation plan. satisfactory to the Bank, for the creation&#13;
of the Users' Hydrographic Confederation will be submitted to the Bank by July&#13;
31. 1997 and that such plan would be implemented in accordance with the agreed&#13;
terms (para 5.2 d).&#13;
(b)   The National Training Program  subcomponent will finance courses,&#13;
seminars and a public information campaign to: (i) increase technical capacity at&#13;
the national and local government level in order to promote the implementation of&#13;
a modern regulatory and institutional framework,  (ii) improve technical and&#13;
managerial skills of professionals and decision makers of the WS&amp;S sector; and&#13;
(iii) stimulate appreciation and understanding among society of the importance of&#13;
the rational use and conservation of water resources and the proper commercial&#13;
management of WS&amp;S services.&#13;
(c)   The Sector Decentralization Program  subcomponent will finance the&#13;
preparation of at least four new rehabilitation projects, replicating the model&#13;
developed in Monagas in other states or regional water companies. The Program&#13;
will include: (i) preparation of investment plans for the physical rehabilitation of&#13;
the systems; and (ii) technical, legal, institutional and financial studies necessary to&#13;
define the decentralization projects according to the model developed in Monagas.&#13;
(d)   The fourth subcomponent will finance consultant services and equipment to&#13;
assist HIDROVEN in legal and institutional development issues related to the&#13;
management of the national institutional component and overall project&#13;
coordination.  This will be provided through specialized consultants and a&#13;
consultant services contract that will include professional and support services and&#13;
related equipment needs. Submission of terms of reference for these consultant&#13;
services was condition of negotiations (para 5.1 h). Agreements were reached&#13;
during negotiations on the project management and monitoring capacity to be&#13;
retained in HIDROVEN and AdM (para 5.2 k). As a condition of disbursement&#13;
for the national institutional component. HIDROVEN will contract and retain as&#13;
part of its project implementation unit, consultants in the areas of financial analysis.&#13;
procurement. sanitary engineering, social communications and legal (para 5.4 e).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
3. 11. Project cost estimates are summarized in table 3. 1. Total project cost, excluding&#13;
import duties and taxes, but including interest during construction, is estimated at US$&#13;
69.8 million. The cost of project components for system rehabilitation and expansion were&#13;
estimated with the assistance of consultants on the basis of the identified eligible&#13;

3.12.  The cost of institutional strengthening and technical assistance investments was&#13;
estimated on the basis of the TOR and expected scope of work and on available local and&#13;
international consultant costs for similar tasks. Costs are based on December 1994 price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
levels. Allowance for price escalation has been incorporated in the US dollars cost&#13;
estimate using the MUV inflation index for FY96: 1.5%; FY97: 1.8%; FY98: 2.6% and&#13;
2.5% for both FY99 and FY2000. A physical contingency of 10% has been used for civil&#13;
works and equipment purchases and of 5% for consultant services in all project&#13;
components (see Annexes E-H for further detail).&#13;
Project Financing&#13;
3.13. The project cost would be financed by (see table 3.2): US$ 39.0 million by the&#13;
World Bank (about 55 percent of total project costs); US$ 5.5 million by the IDB&#13;
(institutional strengthening and a national training program; see Annex H, table 1) as part&#13;
of the project now under preparation for rehabilitation of the Caracas system2 (about 8&#13;
percent of total project cost); and US$ 26.6 million (37 percent of total project cost) by a&#13;
combination of national (US$ 10.3 million), state (US$ 2.7 million) and municipal (US$&#13;
1.4 million) government transfers and internal cash generation from AdM (US$ 12.2&#13;
million).&#13;

E. Legal and Institutional Issues&#13;
3.14.  The contracts and agreements developed during project preparation to address&#13;
legal and institutional issues that could represent constraints for project implementation&#13;
and complement, in an interim basis, the existing legal and regulatory framework for the&#13;
sector, can be grouped in two types: (i) those that regulate the operation of AdM, and (ii)&#13;
those regulate the implementation of the project. To regulate the operation of AdM six&#13;
contracts and agreements will be or have been signed by AdM (see Figure 3):&#13;
(i)    Service Transfer Agreement between HIDROCARIBE and AdM  for the&#13;
transfer of responsibilities, assets and part of the personnel,&#13;
2  Assurances were obtained on the inclusion in the Legal Agreement, as events of default, of (i) failure&#13;
of the IDB loan agreement in becoming effective by one year after effectiveness of the Bank loan; and&#13;
(ii) standard cross-default with IDB legal agreement (para 5.2 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
(ii)   Comodatum Agreement between AdM and MARNR that cedes to AdM&#13;
the right to use the infrastructure for the production of drinking water in&#13;
the State of Monagas;&#13;
(iii)  Service Contracts between AdM and the Municipalities authorizing AdM&#13;
to provide the WS&amp;S services;&#13;
(iv)   Contract Plan between AdM and its stockholders (State of Monagas and&#13;
the Mancomunidad) to define the responsibilities of each party and the&#13;
performance targets for AdM,&#13;
(v)   Management Contract between AdM and a private operator to manage the&#13;
services over a period of four years; and&#13;
(vi)   Ratification  Agreements of the municipalities to  harmonize  these&#13;
documents and correct some inconsistencies and lack of definition detected&#13;
in the Mancomunidad's and AdM's statutes.&#13;

Figure 3.1. Contracts and Agreements&#13;
To regulate project implementation, two additional agreements have been prepared:&#13;
(vii)  Subsidiary Agreement between the national government (through the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and MARNR) HIDROVEN and AdM to (a) transfer&#13;
loan proceeds, on a reimbursable basis, to AdM for the institutional&#13;
development of AdM and the three rehabilitation packages for urban areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
under the regional component; (b) transfer loan proceeds, on a grant basis,&#13;
to AdM for the rural rehabilitation subcomponent; and (c) transfer loan&#13;
proceeds, on a grant basis, to HIDROVEN for the national institutional&#13;
component.&#13;
(viii) 7rust Fund Operating Agreement among AdM and a Fiduciary Bank, for&#13;
delineating the terms and conditions under which the Fiduciary Bank shall&#13;
administer all funds to be provided for the financing of the regional&#13;
component.&#13;
3.15. The legal agreements presented above will enable the project to go forward, taking&#13;
advantage of the strong motivation existing among officials at the central and local&#13;
government levels. Given the importance of these agreements to project execution,&#13;
Submission of signed copies satisfactory to the Bank of the Ratification Agreements,&#13;
Comodatum Agreements, Service Contracts and Service Transfer Agreement and draft&#13;
copies satisfactory to the Bank of the Contract Plan, Subsidiary Agreement and Trust&#13;
Fund Operating Agreement was condition of negotiations (para 5.1 d and e). Submission&#13;
of signed copies of the Contract Plan, Subsidiarv Agreement and Trust Fund Operating&#13;
Agreement is a condition of loan effectiveness (para 5.3 a).&#13;
The Contract Plan&#13;
3.16. A Contract Plan will be signed between AdM, as one of the parties, and the state&#13;
government and the Mancomunidad as the other party. The Contract Plan will spell out&#13;
the responsibilities of each of the parties and will thus become the main reference tool for&#13;
both the state government and the Mancomunidad to evaluate management performance,&#13;
and for the Bank to monitor and supervise the project. The key performance indicators of&#13;
the Contract Plan, which will evolve with time, reflecting the expected improvements in&#13;
efficiency, will be used for the project's monitoring of AdM. These are summarized in&#13;
table 3.3. Agreements were reached during negotiations on the content of the Contract&#13;
Plan, particularly on the financial, physical and investment monitoring indicators and&#13;
targets (para 5.2 a).&#13;
3.17. For their part, the state government and the Mancomunidad would agree to the&#13;
following:&#13;
*  Timely provision of the counterpart funds needed for project implementation.;&#13;
*  Provision of funds to meet AdM's obligations until AdM  reaches financial self-&#13;
sufficiency;&#13;
*  A single tariff structure for the State of Monagas, and a tariff level consistent with&#13;
AdM's financial-self sufficiency goals;&#13;
*  Managerial autonomy, including personnel administration (hiring, firing, promotions&#13;
and salary levels);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
. Full support of AdM's metering and billing goals and full support for AdM's&#13;
disconnection policies for non-payment of water service.&#13;

3.18. The Contract Plan will have a duration of four years. To ensure compliance with&#13;
the Contract Plan, a supervisory committee will be appointed with three representatives:&#13;
one from the Governor's office, one from the Mancomunidad and one from AdM. The&#13;
Committee shall meet at least twice a year, and prior to the mid-term review, to propose&#13;
the changes that might be necessary to reach the original goals. Submission to the Bank of&#13;
a draft Contract Plan was condition of negotiations (para 5.1 e). As a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness, the Contract Plan shall have been signed by AdM. the state of Monagas&#13;
government and all municipalities in the state of Monagas which have authorized to&#13;
operate under a signed service contract (this includes all municipalities, except Cedefio)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
(para 5.3 a). As condition of disbursements for urban rehabilitation investments in Cedefio&#13;
or any new municipality, such municipality shall sign the Contract Plan (para 5.4 a).&#13;
Management Contract&#13;
3.19. AdM will contract a private sector operator to manage AdM for a period of four&#13;
years. The management contract is intended to provide AdM with a private operator's&#13;
management approach and with the experience and working methodology that are&#13;
required to confront the important transformation process initiated with the transfer of&#13;
responsibilities from H1DROCARIBE. It is also intended to complement and improve the&#13;
chances of success of the financial support that will be provided through the project for&#13;
the company's strengthening and the rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure. The&#13;
management contract would be a first step in the process of involving the private sector in&#13;
the delivery of the service, which is expected to result in a concession or lease contract at&#13;
the end of the project.&#13;
3.20. Under the design that has been adopted for the management contract, the operator&#13;
will be directly responsible for the management of the services and the contracts with&#13;
providers, for controlling the commercial activities of AdM and for the implementation&#13;
and monitoring of the works and investments to be financed by the project.  The&#13;
responsibility of managing the services also includes the obligatory achievement of the&#13;
performance targets of the Contract Plan agreed upon by AdM and its stakeholders. Key&#13;
tasks to be carried out by the operator include the management of:  (i) setting up&#13;
macrometering of production; (ii) development and implementation of the commercial and&#13;
information system; (iii) public relations with customers; and (iv) review of present&#13;
contracts with local operators for the provision of labor and equipment services for the&#13;
operation and maintenance of the systems. Investments required for these activities,&#13;
particularly for installing macrometering of production, computer hardware and software&#13;
for the commercial system and development of a public awareness campaign will be&#13;
financed under the project.&#13;
3.21. Consistent with its objectives, the management contract will be incentive-based to&#13;
encourage the private operator to reduce unaccounted-for-water and improve collection of&#13;
bills above the targets set in the Contract Plan. It has also been designed so that the direct&#13;
risk taken by the private operator is minimized by fixed monthly payments, financed by the&#13;
project as part of the regional component. These payments will only be conditioned to the&#13;
successful achievement of performance targets equal to those adopted as part of the&#13;
Contract Plan (penalties will apply when these performance targets are not reached). This&#13;
approach has been adopted in order to overcome the doubts that could arise in potential&#13;
operators because of the past experience with the failed concession of Caracas, the present&#13;
macroeconomic situation of Venezuela and the conditions of AdM.  Submission of&#13;
evidence that AdM has issued the letter of invitation for the Management Contract bid was&#13;
a condition of negotiations (para 5.1 f). Signature and effectiveness of the Management&#13;
Contract is a condition of disbursement for the second rehabilitation package of&#13;
investments (para 5.4 b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
F. Project Implementation&#13;
3.22. Executing Agencies. The project will be implemented over a four-year period.&#13;
The borrower will be the Republic of Venezuela. AdM will execute the regional&#13;
component and HIDROVEN will execute the national institutional component. Present&#13;
experience of co-execution of Bank project among national and local-regional institutions&#13;
is very limited in Venezuela. Since this project intends to support decentralization, to&#13;
ensure that this concept is met and to simplify the management by AdM of the loan&#13;
proceeds for the subcomponents it will execute, confirmation of the request to the Finance&#13;
Commission of the National Congress to include AdM as co-executor of the project,&#13;
together with HIDROVEN, in the Umbrella Law (Ley Paraguas) 1996 was condition of&#13;
negotiations (para 5.1 c).&#13;
3.23.  Flow of Funds. The loan proceeds for the reimbursement of expenses incurred&#13;
under the regional component will be transferred into a trust fund managed by AdM, with&#13;
two accounts: (i) the first account will be used for the expenses related to the institutional&#13;
support to AdM and the three rehabilitation packages in urban areas and will receive the&#13;
funds as reimbursable transfers made according to a subsidiary loan agreement, between&#13;
the national government and AdM, with the same maturity and grace period as the Bank&#13;
loan; (ii) the second account will be used for the expenses related to the PROPAMAR,&#13;
which will receive the funds as non-reimbursable transfers from the national government as&#13;
part of a direct subsidy to poor rural users. The interest rate for the reimbursable transfers&#13;
of funds will be variable and pegged to the active rate for the six largest commercial banks&#13;
as reported by the Central Bank. Funds for the national institutional component will be&#13;
provided to HIDROVEN as a non-reimbursable transfer from the Government. Project&#13;
Management Units will be established in AdM and HIDROVEN to implement the&#13;
components that each will execute. HIDROVEN will coordinate overall monitoring and&#13;
reporting activities to the Bank. A detailed Implementation Plan is presented in Arnnex J.&#13;
Agreements were reached during negotiations on the onlending conditions for the&#13;
subsidiary loan to AdM, the conditions for the grant transfer of loan proceeds to AdM for&#13;
the PROPAMAR, and to HIDROVEN for the national institutional component (para 5.2&#13;
e) and the content and conditions of the Trust Fund Operating Agreement (para 5.2 f).&#13;
3.24. Disbursement Conditionality. Disbursement of funds for the first rehabilitation&#13;
package of emergency rehabilitation works, as well as funds for the institutional support to&#13;
AdM, would be contingent upon loan effectiveness. Disbursement for rehabilitation works&#13;
in Cedenio or any new municipality will be conditioned on the signature of the Contract&#13;
Plan by such municipality (para 5.4 a). Disbursement for the second rehabilitation package&#13;
for priority rehabilitation works will be conditioned on the signature and effectiveness of&#13;
the Management Contract with a private operator (para 5.4 b). Disbursement for the third&#13;
rehabilitation package will be conditioned on compliance with the first year targets&#13;
incorporated in the Contract Plan and a determination by the Bank. based on satisfactory&#13;
projections. that the targets for the current year will be reached by AdM (para 5.4 c).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
3.25. Ceilings and eligibility criteria of the PROPAMAR will apply to investments in&#13;
rural areas under the rural rehabilitation subcomponent. Two grant ceilings would be set:&#13;
the first, amounting to approximately $56 per capita, would apply to those communities&#13;
which have a water system that needs to be improved (about 90% of the state's rural&#13;
communities); the second, amounting to approximately $180 per capita, would apply to&#13;
communities where no water supply infrastructure currently exists (about 10% of the rural&#13;
communities of the state). In order to become eligible for financing these communities&#13;
will have to: (i) set up or use an existing a community organization to plan, manage and&#13;
finance the operation and maintenance of their system; (ii) prepare, with support from&#13;
AdM (through the contract with an NGO), a proposal detailing the intended rehabilitation&#13;
investments, the nature and cost of the works, the anticipated improvements to be&#13;
obtained and the contribution to be raised in cash or in kind by the community for&#13;
investment cost-sharing and (iii) agree to take over the management and financing of the&#13;
system once it is rehabilitated, detailing the planned scheme for its operation, maintenance&#13;
and financing. Submission of a draft operating manual for the PROPAMAR was condition&#13;
of negotiations (para 5.1 g). Disbursement for the rural rehabilitation subcomponent will&#13;
be conditioned on:  (i) the signature of the contract with an NGO to manage the&#13;
PROPAMAR:  (ii) approval of the final operating manual for the PROPAMAR&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank: and (iii) initial capitalization of the trust fund in an amount of at&#13;
least US$ 150.000 (para 5.4 d and annex G para 11).&#13;
3.26.  Project Supervision.  Supervision requirements are expected to be high,&#13;
especially during the first year of project implementation. It is expected that at least three&#13;
supervision missions per year (four in the first year), staffed by an environmental engineer,&#13;
a financial analyst and an specialist in human resources and community participation, plus&#13;
one technical specialist from the resident mission, with a duration of about two weeks per&#13;
mission, will be required to supervise the project during its implementation.  Bank&#13;
missions should plan to visit the municipalities where rehabilitation works are under way,&#13;
at least once during construction and once during the operation of the rehabilitated&#13;
infrastructure, as well as HIDROVEN' offices in Caracas in relation with the national&#13;
component. Other states integrated in the Sector Decentralization Program will be visited&#13;
as time and resources permit. For the first year, including the project launch workshop,&#13;
the supervision requirements are estimated at about 45 to 50 staff weeks (about 15 staff&#13;
weeks from the resident mission, mainly for day to day supervision).  Supervision&#13;
requirements will fall to about 35 to 40 staff weeks per year thereafter (about 10 to 15&#13;
staff weeks per year from the resident mission).&#13;
3.27. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements. Overall coordination and report&#13;
preparation would be the responsibility of the Implementation Units in HIDROVEN and&#13;
AdM, which would submit semi-annual reports to all the financing agencies, the&#13;
Mancomunidad, the state's government office and HIDROVEN. Agreements were&#13;
reached during negotiations on the content and timetable for preparing and submitting to&#13;
the Bank audited project accounts and financial statements (para 5.2 h). Reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
requirements and their content are spelled out in the project's implementation plan (Annex&#13;
J).&#13;
3.28. Both HIDROVEN and AdM have had little experience with managing a project&#13;
under Bank guidelines. Their capacity will be strengthened by the adoption of accounting&#13;
and financial monitoring procedures satisfactory to the Bank and by the hiring of qualified&#13;
consultants and the contracting of the private operator in AdM under the management&#13;
contract (see annex J). Recognizing these institutions' unfamiliarity with Bank procedures&#13;
and guidelines, it is also proposed that within two months after loan approval, a launch&#13;
workshop will be held in Venezuela. The purpose of this workshop will be to acquaint the&#13;
Implementation Units with Bank's procedures and therefore ensure that the project will get&#13;
off to an expeditious and good start.  The workshop will concentrate on fulfilling&#13;
conditions for effectiveness and disbursement, on procurement and sample bid documents,&#13;
on withdrawal requests, on reporting (including monitoring of key project performance&#13;
indicators), on accounting of expenses procedures (as part of project preparation,&#13;
guidelines and support is being provided to HIDROVEN and AdM on this matter,&#13;
particularly for the eligible expenses for retroactive financing) and in general on all key&#13;
project events.  Adoption by AdM  and HIDROVEN  of accounting and financial&#13;
monitoring procedures satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness (para 5.3 c).&#13;
3.29. Mid-Term Review. The mid-term review will be carried out not be later than 2&#13;
years from the date that the loan becomes effective.  During this review particular&#13;
attention will be paid to the status of: (a) compliance with the performance indices&#13;
included in the Contract Plan (see table 3.3.); (b) creation and proper functioning of the&#13;
CHU; (c) degree of community participation in the project in general, and in the rural&#13;
systems in particular; (d) compliance with covenants, particularly those dealing with the&#13;
restructuring, finances and auditing of the sector and tariff level and structure;  (e)&#13;
progress in procurement; and (f) project success as indicated by user's satisfaction and the&#13;
report of a local NGO.  The mid-term  review will be carried out jointly by the&#13;
Government, the Mancomunidad, the state government, HIDROVEN, the IDB and the&#13;
Bank. As a result of this review corrective steps will be proposed. These might include&#13;
modifications in project scope and/or components, changes in covenants, etc. The project&#13;
has also been structured so that, depending on the results of the mid-term Review,&#13;
contracting of certain project components will proceed or be postponed or canceled. A&#13;
detailed implementation plan for the project is also included in Annex J. Agreements were&#13;
reached during negotiations on the project's implementation plan and the timing and&#13;
content of the project's annual and mid-term review mission and semiannual reports (para&#13;
5.2 c and i).&#13;
G. Procurement, Disbursement and Auditing&#13;
3.30.  Procurement.  HIDROVEN  and AdM  will be responsible for procurement&#13;
implementation. They will manage the multiple purchases required for project implementation&#13;
with the help of the consultant services hired under the national institutional component (in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
case of H1DROVEN) and the private operator hired under the management contract (in the&#13;
case of AdM). Their capacity and skills to this end will be enhanced during the planned&#13;
project's launch workshop. Article 73 of Venezuela's Procurement Law [Ley de Licitacionesy&#13;
su Reglamento, Gazeta Oficial No. 34.528 (1990) y No. 34.628 (1991)] states that contracts&#13;
which are financed by international financial institutions will be procured following the&#13;
procurement guidelines of the respective institutions. Procurement of goods and civil works&#13;
under the project would be done in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated January 1995, as revised in January 1996, using&#13;
Bank-issued standard bidding documents for international competitive bidding (ICB), and&#13;
standard bidding documents agreed to with the Bank for national competitive bidding (NCB).&#13;
The project procurement arrangements are summarized in table 3.4.&#13;
3.31. It is estimated that 8 percent of the loan will be used to procure goods and services&#13;
under ICB, 33 percent under NCB and 10 percent under fixed price contracts awarded on&#13;
the basis of quotations obtained from, at least, three qualified domestic contractors in&#13;
response to a written invitation. Of the remainder, 38 percent will be devoted to procure&#13;
consultants' services under Bank guidelines.  Specific procurement arrangements for&#13;
consultant services, civil works and goods and equipment purchases are detailed below:&#13;
(a)    Procurement of Consultants. The contracting of US$ 14.6 million of&#13;
consulting firms and of individual consultants to be Bank financed would be carried&#13;
out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, dated&#13;
August 1981, which require prior review by the Bank of budgets, short lists,&#13;
selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and&#13;
contract. For complex consulting assignments, Bank-issued standard forms of&#13;
contract would be used. Consultant services worth US$ 5.4 million would be&#13;
financed by the IDB and would be contracted according to IDB's guidelines.&#13;
(b)   Procurement of Civil Works. Given the nature of the goods and services&#13;
to be procured under the project, participation is expected from local contractors.&#13;
Civil works includes repairs to the existing water and sewerage systems, most of which&#13;
is relatively small in size and geographically dispersed. As the largest civil works&#13;
contract will not exceed US$ 2 million, it is unlikely that foreign contractors would be&#13;
interested. To the extent practicable, civil works would be grouped into packages&#13;
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$ 250,000 or more, and procured on the basis of&#13;
NCB. Very small works which cannot be grouped into packages estimated to cost&#13;
the equivalent of less than US$ 250,000 would be procured under lump sum, fixed&#13;
price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
eligible contractors in response to a written invitation, up to an approximate&#13;
aggregate of US$ 5.1 million.&#13;

(c)    Procurement of Goods.  Purchases of goods would consist of computer&#13;
equipment, pumps, motors, valves, meters, pipes, chlorinators and electric command&#13;
boards. To the extent practicable, goods will be grouped into packages estimated to&#13;
cost the equivalent of US$ 250,000 or more and procured on the basis of ICB. In the&#13;
evaluation of bids under ICB, the preference for domestically manufactured goods&#13;
provided for in the Bank's Guidelines will apply. Goods estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$ 250,000 may be procured through NCB, up to an aggregate of US$ 7 million.&#13;
Small purchases which cannot be grouped into packages estimated to cost the&#13;
equivalent from US$ 50,000 or more may be procured using national or intemational&#13;
shopping procedures, up to an aggregate of US$ 4.6 million. Purchases of computer&#13;
equipment will be small and not expected to exceed US$ 200,000 in total and would be&#13;
carried out through international shopping among suppliers with service facilities in&#13;
Venezuela.&#13;
3.32. Prior Review Arrangements. Requirements for Bank's prior review of procurement&#13;
documentation will be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
(a)    Goods and Civil Works. All bid packages of US$ 100,000 or more for goods&#13;
and US$ 250,000 or more for works, and the first two contracts for works after project&#13;
effectiveness, irrespective of their amount, would be subject to the Bank's prior review&#13;
of procurement documentation.&#13;
(b)    Consultant Services. All consultant contracts estimated at the equivalent of&#13;
US$ 100,000 or more for firms and US$ 50,000 or more for individuals would be&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review. The requirement of Bank prior review will not&#13;
apply to contracts valued at less than the aforementioned amounts. However, this&#13;
exception to prior Bank review will not apply to: (i) the terms of reference for said&#13;
contracts; (ii) single-source selection of consulting firms; (iv) assignments of a critical&#13;
nature, as reasonably deterrnined by the Bank; and (v) amendments of contracts raising&#13;
the contract value over US$ 100,000 in the case of firms and US$ 50,000 in the case of&#13;
individual consultants.&#13;
3.33. The prior review thresholds described above will result in prior review by the Bank&#13;
of approximately 60 % of the total value of all Bank-financed contracts. This relatively&#13;
limited prior review is justified by the fact that most contracts for both goods and works&#13;
will be small and widely dispersed in terms of location and timing and by the control&#13;
provided through the physical audits to be carried out by the private operator managing&#13;
AdM on the urban rehabilitation investments and by the NGO that will manage the&#13;
PROPAMAR on the rural rehabilitation investments.&#13;
3.34. Disbursements. Disbursements will be made over a four year period, which is&#13;
shorter than the average disbursement period for water projects in the LAC Region.&#13;
However, given the simple nature of the investments to be financed under the project, and&#13;
the management capacity of the private contractor which will facilitate project execution,&#13;
the proposed disbursement period is reasonable. In order to lower the risk of insufficient&#13;
counterpart funds from the central government due to current fiscal constraints,&#13;
disbursements would be made on a declining percentages basis, as shown in tables 3.5 and&#13;
3.6 below. These tables also present expected disbursement amounts by category and&#13;
year. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2000. Therefore, the closing&#13;
date for the proposed loan would be December 31, 2000.&#13;
3.35. Expenditures for individual contracts for goods and services for which prior review&#13;
by the Bank is not required will be disbursed by means of Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs).  Detailed supporting documentation for expenditures will be kept by the&#13;
executing agencies and provided to the Bank's supervision missions and project auditors&#13;
when requested. Full documentation shall be provided for all contracts requiring Bank's&#13;
prior review.&#13;

3.36.  Special Account and Retroactive Financing.  In order to expedite the loan&#13;
disbursements, a special account in US$ will be opened by the Ministry of Finance in the&#13;
Central Bank for US$ 2,400,000. The account would be replenished monthly, upon&#13;
receipt of properly documented withdrawal applications. The initial deposit will be limited&#13;
to US$ 1,000,000. The balance of the authorized allocation would be available for&#13;
withdrawal once aggregated disbursements reach a total of US$ 4,000,000. Subject to&#13;
approval by the Central Bank, the Special Account would have two sub-accounts, one for&#13;
each executing agency, to facilitate the operation and transparency of the Special Account.&#13;
The initial date for retroactive financing will be one year before loan signing. Payments made&#13;
for expenditures incurred prior to the date of signing should not exceed an aggregate of US$ 2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
million (5% of loan amount). Such financing is necessary to address urgent and emergency&#13;
rehabilitation works and initiate critical institutional strengthening activities.&#13;

3.37. Accounting and Auditing. The financial management capacity of both AdM and&#13;
HIDROVEN was reviewed during project appraisal. Although it is expected that most&#13;
project management activities will be outsourced, it will still be necessary to improve&#13;
capacity in each of these institutions. The project's institutional development components&#13;
will address these needs. Before project effectiveness, a financial reporting and accounting&#13;
system in both executing agencies will be agreed upon, in order to ensure accountability&#13;
and correct management of project funds and to facilitate auditing during project&#13;
implementation. The accounting system will be developed following an in-depth review of&#13;
budgeting, accounting, internal control and reporting procedures and planned flow of&#13;
funds for the project, and it will describe: (i) the sources and uses of funds provided under&#13;
the project; and (ii) the amount of expenditures reimbursed through the Statement of&#13;
Expenditure system, the Special Account and through direct payment by the Bank,&#13;
respectively. The adoption of financial reporting and accounting systems in both agencies&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank will also have the objective of guaranteeing the existence of&#13;
adequate monitoring and reporting capacity in these executing agencies.&#13;
3.38. Bank staff have also reviewed with the authorities the set-up of the necessary&#13;
project accounts, the Bank's auditing requirements, and the use and operation of the&#13;
Special Account.  The two implementing agencies would manage separate project&#13;
accounts. The Bank will review the external auditor's terms of reference for a multi-year&#13;
audit contract. The Bank will continue to provide specialized support to the implementing&#13;
agencies during the early stages of project implementation. Agreements were confirmed&#13;
during negotiations that project accounts, financial statements, the Special Account and&#13;
the SOEs would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and&#13;
that their reports will be prepared following acceptable auditing standards (para 5.2 g).&#13;
The audited accounts and the auditor's report would be submitted to the Bank within six&#13;
months following the end of each fiscal year. SOEs will be reviewed by the Bank on a&#13;
regular basis.&#13;
H. Environmental Impacts&#13;
3.39. The project has an environmental category rating of "B". It will concentrate&#13;
primarily on the rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure, the development of the legal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
and institutional framework for the appropriate management of water resources and the&#13;
improvement of service quality. Environmental conditions in the urban and rural areas that&#13;
now receive inadequate services will improve as a result. The project will also have a&#13;
positive impact on the water quality conditions of the state due to the adoption of better&#13;
wastewater management practices and the rehabilitation of existing treatment plants.&#13;
Specifically, water use conflicts and wastewater management options will be identified,&#13;
water quality objectives for selected river basins will be established, pollution loads and&#13;
their relative weight in overall water quality of selected river basins will be determined and&#13;
watershed protection measures will be identified. These activities will be undertaken&#13;
under the subcomponent of the national component that will support the creation and&#13;
functioning of the Users' Hydrographic Confederation, to be implemented by&#13;
HIDROVEN, with the involvement of the area stakeholders (see annex I for details and&#13;
budget line item).&#13;
3.40.  Given that the project will finance the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, and&#13;
some minor expansion of the distribution and sewerage networks (mainly in marginal and&#13;
rural areas), no siting issues, adverse environmental effects or social problems are&#13;
expected to be encountered. Therefore, no explicit environmental criteria or review&#13;
procedures are required for the relevant subprojects.  Final engineering designs and&#13;
consultant services for the preparation of an improvement and expansion plan for the&#13;
water and sewerage systems will give adequate attention to environmental issues. Terms&#13;
of Reference to be prepared during project implementation for these activities will be&#13;
subject to prior Bank review to guarantee this end.&#13;
1. Social Impact&#13;
3.41. Given the existing relatively high levels of WS&amp;S service coverage in Venezuela,&#13;
the impact of the project will mainly be felt through the positive health, social and&#13;
environmental consequences of avoiding the deterioration of these coverage levels and&#13;
improving the quality and reliability of these services. The project's rural subcomponent&#13;
will expand these services, improving and augmenting the present coverage levels among&#13;
the poor population in those communities, and it will help strengthen the communities'&#13;
involvement and self-reliance in public services planning and provision.&#13;
J. Project Sustainability&#13;
3.42.  The project has been prepared through a strong participatory process involving&#13;
consultation and a series of workshops with all relevant stakeholders (elected officials,&#13;
representatives of commerce and industry, user groups and NGOs) and two extensive&#13;
willingness to pay studies in the urban and rural areas. There is a broadly shared view in&#13;
Venezuela, and particularly in Monagas, that significant institutional reforms are possible&#13;
when accompanied by concrete improvements in service reliability. The project will help&#13;
obtain these. The project will also help establish an adequate regulatory framework at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
national level and an efficient water utility in the state of Monagas to administer WS&amp;S&#13;
services in a commercial manner, eliminating national government subsidies over the&#13;
implementation period. A financial plan was agreed to achieve, in the early years of&#13;
project implementation, the coverage of at least operating costs, and permit, by the end of&#13;
the implementation period, debt service and contribution to future expansion. Targets for&#13;
financial and physical performance and investments were agreed and incorporated into the&#13;
draft Contract Plan to be signed among the state, the Mancomunidad of municipalities and&#13;
AdM. In addition, to achieve these targets, AdM will contract, through a competitive&#13;
process, the management of the service to a private operator with international experience.&#13;

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
4.1.   The major benefits of this project will be:  (a) improved water supply and&#13;
sewerage service to the population of the state of Monagas; (b) a well-operated and&#13;
financially viable water supply and sewerage system in the state; (c) a clearer delineation&#13;
of responsibilities between institutions; and (d) effective sector policies at the national&#13;
level. Another important benefit will be the mobilization of additional resources for the&#13;
sector through improved billing and collection and appropriate pricing, thereby shifting the&#13;
financial burden of the services from the national government to the users.  The&#13;
management of AdM by a private operator will be a major impetus to greater involvement&#13;
of the private sector in other systems in Venezuela. The project will directly benefit the&#13;
majority of the state population, estimated at about 540,000 inhabitants. Improving the&#13;
collection and final disposal of wastewater and adopting better wastewater management&#13;
practices will also cause environmental benefits.&#13;
4.2.  In addition to these benefits, the project is consistent with the Government's&#13;
strategy for the sector (para 1.8) and the last Bank Country Assistance Strategy, builds on&#13;
lessons learnt from other Bank operations in LAC, and has secured the national and local&#13;
government political support (para 1.25 through 1.29). The work carried out during&#13;
project preparation has also confirmed its justification through: (i) the economic analysis&#13;
of the project as a whole and, particularly, of the rehabilitation investments; (ii) the&#13;
financial analysis of AdM; (iii) two willingness-to-pay studies in Maturin and in the state's&#13;
rural communities; and (iv) the assessment and mitigation of the project risks. The results&#13;
of this preparatory work are presented below, and detailed in Annexes D, K and L.&#13;
B. Economic Justification&#13;
4.3.   The proposed project will improve water distribution and quality of service and reduce&#13;
water losses in Monagas. The evaluation of project costs and benefits of the reallocation of&#13;
water among users and reduction of losses, based on a conservative marginal social value for&#13;
water of Bs 60 per cubic meter (the current tariff), results in an economic rate of return of&#13;
15% for the rehabilitation investment component, or about 65% of project costs. If consumer&#13;
surpluses, based on a marginal social value of Bs 100/i3, are also taken into account in the&#13;
calculation, the rate of return rises to 27%. The details of this economic analysis are presented&#13;
in Annex L. Additional justification for the project can be provided by the expected impacts:&#13;
(a) at the macroeconomic level, where the reduction of public transfers will positively impact&#13;
the fiscal deficit without reducing the level of service, as AdM assumes service responsibility&#13;
and water tariffs are rationalized. Savings could eventually reach more than US$ 200 million&#13;
annually in EIIDROVENs budget if this approach is expanded nationwide; (b) at the sector&#13;
level, where the proposed project will have an important impact not only on promoting a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
rational structure to administer water supply systems throughout the country, but it will also&#13;
contribute to the performance of other sectors such as public health. In the state of Monagas,&#13;
deficient water and sewerage service is regarded as a "public health problem", where local&#13;
health officials estimated that 42,000 cases of water-related illnesses (with a pubLic health cost&#13;
calculated at US$ 2.4 million annually) can be prevented by improved water and sanitation&#13;
services. Concomitant losses in productivity as a result of lbsences from work due to illness&#13;
have been estimated to amount to 56,000 work days per year, at an additional cost of about&#13;
US$ 0.6 million per year.&#13;
4.4.   Quantification of Economic Benefits.  Without the proposed project, it can be&#13;
expected that the distribution network in Monagas will continue to deteriorate, current&#13;
shortages will become more severe and losses will continue to increase due to lack of&#13;
maintenance. With the project, a gradual irnprovement is expected, generating benefits through&#13;
the rehabilitation of the distribution network, better operational and financial management and&#13;
reduction of losses from waste, excessive consumption and the system's disrepair. The&#13;
economic benefits of the project will be derived from (i) the reallocation of water among users&#13;
and (ii) the reduction of physical losses. In order to measure the impact of reallocation, it is&#13;
assumed that a gradual shift from areas with excessive consumption to shortage areas will take&#13;
place in the next 5 years as a result of the proposed project. This shift will reallocate as much&#13;
as 10% (5.5 Mm3 per year) of maximum demand, from a "market" which consumes excessive&#13;
amounts at almost zero price, toward a "market" which currently has permanent shortages due&#13;
to low pressures or distribution problems (deteriorated pipes, non-working valves, in-house&#13;
leaks, etc.) and where water has a higher economic value (as detected by the high willingness-&#13;
to-pay of the population). This reallocation will result in net gains with a Net Present Value of&#13;
US$ 10.2 million'. Physical losses are estimated now at about 20 Mm3 per year or nearly one-&#13;
third of production. The impact of system repairs and operation improvements on losses&#13;
reduction was estimated assuming that in the next five years, these loses are reduced by 500/o,&#13;
that is, 10 Mm3 are recovered yearly by the year 2000 and that such volume will be available to&#13;
areas with current deficits and to new consumers. The Net Present Value of the recovery of&#13;
physical losses is calculated at US$ 20.5 million. The benefits of (i) recapturing physical losses&#13;
and (ii) reallocating water use among consumers due to better operation and management, will&#13;
result in a total Net Present Value of about US$ 30.7 million.&#13;
4.5.   Sensitivity analysis. The most critical parameters in the calculation of the project's net&#13;
benefits are the marginal value of water, the volume of water which can be recovered and the&#13;
amount that can be redistributed. The above estimates may be considered a conservative&#13;
scenario, since the value of water (Bs 60 per m3) is the minimum which can be assumed (see&#13;
annex D where results from the willingness-to-pay studies show that much higher values are&#13;
attributed by consumers). Also, the 5.5 Mm3 per year redistributed is only 10% of most&#13;
probable consumption, and the 10 Mm3 of physical losses to be reduced in 5 years is only 10%&#13;
of production and 50% of the estimated physical losses - a feasible goal.&#13;
In this case, there is a zero net transfer in terms of water volumes. Gains are discounted at 12% over a&#13;
20 year. As there are no estimates of the marginal cost of capital to use as the discount rate, 12%&#13;
is used as point of reference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
C. Financial Analysis of AdM&#13;
4.6.   Financial Model and Projections.  According to the financial model and&#13;
projections prepared using the most reliable information available, under the project&#13;
assumptions AdM's future financial performance is expected to be satisfactory. AdM is&#13;
expected to generate operating and net incomes on the order of 22% and 13%,&#13;
respectively, of revenues by the end of project execution, cover about 33% of investments&#13;
by 1999 and 2000 and 100% thereafter, and maintain a debt service coverage ratio above&#13;
1.5 after 2000 and over 2 after 2002, and a quick ratio over 6 during project execution&#13;
and over 1 .5 after project execution. Rates of return on invested capital are projected by&#13;
the model to meet or exceed 5% on revalued assets on 2006. A study to identify and&#13;
reevaluate the service's assets and liabilities and the assets transferred under Comodatum&#13;
has been carried out during project preparation. These assets (presently under&#13;
HIDROCARIBE, MARNR and the municipalities) have been transferred to AdM, upon&#13;
the transfer of the service from HIDROCARIBE to AdM, and properly accounted for (the&#13;
model takes into consideration assets valued about 2,350 million Bs, that are registered in&#13;
HIDROCARIBE's accounts for 1995). Annex K shows the financial forecast for the&#13;
period 1996-2005, including a description of the methodology and main assumptions used.&#13;
The agreed financial performance covenants for AdM, as confirmed during negotiations,&#13;
are shown in table 4.1. (para 5.2 j)&#13;
Table 4.1. Financial Targets for AdM&#13;

Contribution to         n/a     12%     17%    33%      33%&#13;
Investments (%)&#13;
4.7.   Sensitivity Analysis. The analysis of AdM's financial projections showed that the&#13;
financial situation of the company is very sensitive to lower-than-expected revenues&#13;
because of: (i) delays or lack of adoption of tariff level adjustments; (ii) collection/billing&#13;
efficiency is not improved according to projected targets; or (iii) the reduction targets&#13;
established for the unaccounted-for-water can not be achieved (the associated reduced&#13;
revenues and increased operation costs can not be transferred to the consumers through&#13;
tariff adjustments). Small changes in the assumptions for these parameters would impact&#13;
on AdM's finances and would easily make the company's investment program not viable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
(a mere 5% reduction in the tariff adjustment projected for 1997 would result in a&#13;
reduction of about 29 and 47% of the net income and cash flow aggregated until 2001 and&#13;
a required increase in the counterpart contribution support of about 23%, while a 10%&#13;
failure in the target for the reduction of unaccounted-for-water would result in&#13;
respectively -12%, -29% and +9% changes in these same indicators). The risk that this&#13;
represents will be controlled through intensive and close supervision and the expected&#13;
continued political commitment and support for the sustainability of the company and the&#13;
project objectives, and through these to the adoption of tariff increases when these are&#13;
necessary to counteract exceptional circumstances that are external to AdM's management&#13;
capacity. They will additionally be minimized through the contracting of the company's&#13;
management to a private operator which has proved experience in this field and the&#13;
adoption of an investment program that will concentrate on the rehabilitation of the system&#13;
and on metering.&#13;
4.8.   On the other hand, the sensitivity of AdM's financial situation to worse than&#13;
projected exchange rate and domestic inflation or higher internal interest rates is small.&#13;
The exposure of AdM to changes in these parameters can be summarized as follows:&#13;
a) AdM's principal exchange rate exposure is linked to the impact on the cost of&#13;
imported goods and services to be financed under the project, but not on the debt&#13;
service of the bolivar-denominated subloan (exchange rate risks for loan repayment&#13;
will remain with the national government). Therefore, the impact of increases over the&#13;
expected official exchange rate at the end of 1997 is small, mainly due to the automatic&#13;
adjustment of tariffs (an increment of 20% over the projected exchange rate would&#13;
only require an increment of the counterpart support of 1%), and this mnight be&#13;
mitigated by reductions or changes in the proposed investment plan.&#13;
b) Similarly, if tariffs are adjusted according to the present adjustment formula,&#13;
AdM's exposure to domestic inflation is mainly linked to the impact it might have on&#13;
the exchange rate or the cost of the investments, but only marginally through the&#13;
increments of the operation and maintenance costs (the impact of an increment of the&#13;
domestic inflation of about 20% over the projection would even have a 3% positive&#13;
impact on the net income figures in current bolivares, but would require an increment&#13;
in the counterpart support of 7%).&#13;
c) The interest rate for the subsidiary loan to AdM is assumed to respond to changes&#13;
in the inflation rate, but-if interest rate increases are above these projections, AdM's&#13;
main risk will be associate with its difficulty in transferring the incremental cost to&#13;
consumers without a tariff increase, since this element is not included as part of the&#13;
updating formula. However, since the interest will be capitalized during the&#13;
construction period, the impact of increases in the interest rate will be mainly felt on&#13;
the cash flow and income after project completion and on the ability of AdM to repay&#13;
the loan to the national government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
4.9.   Working capital. Initial working capital for AdM will be provided through the&#13;
combination of three mechanisms: (i) AdM will collect all accounts receivable as of July&#13;
1995, when it took over the commercial management of the service, and keep a&#13;
percentage of these payments equivalent to the excess over the historic collection rate of&#13;
HIDROCARIBE; (ii) for the period between July and December 1995, HIDROCARIBE&#13;
has covered the operating deficit of AdM using the reallocated funds received from the&#13;
national government for the operation of the service in the state of Monagas in 1995; and&#13;
(iii) a revolving fund will be created in AdM for the financing of the project investments&#13;
through the reimbursement by the Bank of the expenses eligible for retroactive financing&#13;
executed by HIDROCARIBE, that will be fully covered by grant contributions from the&#13;
state and national governments budgeted investment funds.  With the conservative&#13;
assumptions used in the financial projections, AdM is expected to maintain a positive cash&#13;
balance of about 89 million Bs in 1999 (increasing to 158 and 3,400 million Bs in 2000&#13;
and 2001) and to generate increasingly positive balances from this year onwards. Given&#13;
the importance of securing sufficient working capital for AdM's proper functioning and&#13;
for the adequate project implementation, submission of a plan satisfactory to the Bank for&#13;
the provision of working capital for AdM was condition of negotiations (para 5.1 b).&#13;
4.10. Financial Risks. As a new company with a low level of permanent personnel and&#13;
tariff levels which have been adjusted in line with projected financial needs prior to project&#13;
execution, AdM starts off on a financial footing stronger than many similar companies&#13;
supported by Bank projects. Nevertheless, it faces financial risks primarily related to&#13;
operating in a high inflationary environment for the next several years, including further&#13;
expected devaluation of the currency and variable high interest rates under the proposed&#13;
onlending arrangements. This environment will only make the movement from a culture&#13;
of non-payment for water supply and sanitation services to achievement of financial&#13;
autonomy for AdM more difficult. Therefore, the principal risk to the financial viability of&#13;
the project relates to the political willingness to make future adjustments to tariffs in the&#13;
context of high domestic inflation and adjustments to the exchange rate, lower-than-&#13;
expected revenues and slower than expected reductions in unaccounted-for-water levels.&#13;
4.11.  Also important is the risk associated to the availability of the funds that are&#13;
expected from the national government, both for the investments that are planned to be&#13;
carried out before project effectiveness (which are linked to the initial provision of&#13;
working capital to AdM) and for counterpart contribution. A possible worsening of the&#13;
macroeconomic situation might aggravate this risk.&#13;
4.12. The project has been designed to lessen these risks through: (i) a commitment for&#13;
a capital subsidy from the national government during the early years of project execution,&#13;
justified by the serious state of neglect and disrepair that characterizes the system being&#13;
turned over to the local authorities; (ii) getting clarity and support for the project's&#13;
financial needs by holding discussions with a wide circle of stakeholders in the executive&#13;
and legislative branches of the national government and local governments and broad&#13;
consultation with the affected communities and agreeing on mutual obligations, formalized&#13;
in the Contract Plan;  (iii) utilizing the services of a private operator to introduce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
efficiencies and provide tangible evidence of improved services to make the tariff&#13;
adjustments, when required, more supportable; and (iv) linking the third package of&#13;
rehabilitation investments with compliance with the agreed financial, physical and&#13;
investment targets (including the provision of sufficient counterpart funds) of the Contract&#13;
Plan (para 5.4 c).  Given the importance of adequate tariff levels, during project&#13;
preparation the residential reference tariff was increased from Bs 17.5 to Bs 40 per cubic&#13;
meter as a condition of negotiations (para 5.1 a) and submission of evidence that a&#13;
residential reference tariff increase from Bs 40 to Bs 60 per cubic meter has been&#13;
approved and implemented is a condition of effectiveness (para 5.3 b). Additionally, to&#13;
lessen the risk of a possible shortfall in counterpart funds from the national government,&#13;
the project design allows for a reduction in the investment plan for AdM, since works have&#13;
been packaged into three subcomponents that can be independently executed.&#13;
D. Willingness to Pay Studies&#13;
4.13. Two willingness to pay studies conducted during project preparation2 yielded the&#13;
following main results, which support the project justification:&#13;
*  The Maturin Study. Results from the Maturin study indicate that among the urban&#13;
population there is a high demand and willingness to pay for a water supply system&#13;
with the characteristics the project will support. Against a present average cost of the&#13;
service of US$ 1.25 per month (US$ 15 per year) per connection, the study found that&#13;
85% of respondents would use an improved water system (without improvements in&#13;
sanitation) at an average monthly cost of 1,000 Bs (US$ 5.88), 63% would use it at&#13;
4,000 Bs (US$ 23.5), and even 35% would use it at 7,000 Bs (US$ 41.2)3. The study&#13;
also found that household demand is mainly for improved water quality and&#13;
reliability; hence the project has given priority to rehabilitating the water systems&#13;
over other actions (see Annex D for further details).&#13;
*  The Rural Areas Study. Results indicate that rural residents are primarily concerned&#13;
with water quality and its impact on health.  The study predicts that 60%  of&#13;
respondents -would be willing to pay Bs 2,000 (US$ 11.76) per month and 50% would&#13;
pay 3,000 (US$ 17.6) per month for improved service providing safely potable water.&#13;
These results are significant given that rural users are currently not billed at all for their&#13;
water service.  Moreover, Fifty-six percent of respondents believe that their&#13;
community would want to run its own water system, 73% are somewhat or very&#13;
interested in serving in a water committee, and 58% think that the community would&#13;
do a better job than government in managing the water system. These results provide a&#13;
2     The studies were conducted by CVM, Inc. (USA), in association with DOXA Instituto de&#13;
Opini6n Piiblica (Venezuela), in June, July and August 1995.&#13;
The planned tariff increase from the current 40 to 60 Bs/m3 will amount to an average monthly&#13;
price of 1,800 Bs (US$ 10.60) for residential users and about half that figure for social&#13;
consumers, for an average household consumption level of 30 m3/month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
very favorable basis for the rural pilot program proposed under the project. (See&#13;
Annex G for further details).&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
4.14. The major risks for the proposed project are: (i) inability to overcome the present&#13;
weak institutional capacity; (ii) absence of payment culture which could hinder sound&#13;
commercial practices and the achievement of agreed financial targets;  (iii) possible&#13;
shortfall in counterpart funds and delays in tariff adjustments, which could be aggravated&#13;
by a worsening of the macroeconomic situation; and (iv) decreased political support. The&#13;
first two risks will be reduced by the implementation of the institutional strengthening&#13;
components of the project which will build up normative, regulatory and technical capacity&#13;
and take advantage of private sector involvement through a management contract. The&#13;
third risk has been greatly reduced by the recent agreement with the IMF and is mitigated&#13;
by the strong commitment of national and local government authorities to the&#13;
decentralization process and to the concept of financial sustainability in general and to the&#13;
project in particular, as evidenced by budgetary allocations made for this project under the&#13;
Ley Paraguas (despite stiff public expenditure cuts), the agreed obligations of the state&#13;
government and the municipalities under the Contract Plan, including the tariff increase&#13;
adopted during project preparation and the tariff increase to be adopted before loan&#13;
effectiveness, and a financing plan that seeks to reduce dependency from national budget&#13;
support early in project implementation. The fourth risk is being minimized and managed&#13;
through: (i) the Bank's ongoing discussions with a wide circle of stakeholders in the&#13;
executive and legislative branches of central government and at the local government&#13;
level; and (ii) broad consultation with the affected communities and NGO involvement in&#13;
project preparation.  The third and fourth risks will also be reduced by expected&#13;
constituent demands on the authorities to address the problem of the physical supply&#13;
infrastructure, which is near a state of collapse, and by the grouping of the works to be&#13;
financed under the project into three rehabilitation packages that can be independently&#13;
carried out, linked to the achievement of financial and operation conditions. The project&#13;
assumptions, risk ratings and minimization measures are summarized in the following risk&#13;
matrix.&#13;

Overall Risk Rating              Medium&#13;
1. The macroeconomic            Medium        .  Recent macroeconomic actions and agreement with the IMF on&#13;
situation will remain stable or                   a stabilization program should improve Venezuelan fiscal and&#13;
improve and budget crisis will                    macro-management&#13;
be averted                                    .  Strong support to project objectives, enhanced decentralization,&#13;
reduced dependence on national government support and&#13;
adequate tariff adjustments would help offset the impact of an&#13;
eventual worsening of the macroeconomic situation&#13;
2. Counterpart funds will be      High        *  Federal counterpart funds have been reduced to 10% of total&#13;
available in a timely manner                      project costs&#13;
Declining disbursement percentages have been included to&#13;
provide higher levels of Bank financing in the early years of&#13;
project implementation until AdM's revenue generation&#13;
capacity is improved in the later years&#13;
3. Political support will be      Low         .  During project preparation, an extensive consultative process&#13;
maintained throughout the                         helped to build consensus among all stakeholders; newly&#13;
project lifc                                      elected state and municipal authorities (in office since January&#13;
1996 for at least three years, with possibility of re-election)&#13;
have expressed strong commitment to the objectives and means&#13;
of the project, in line with their predecessors, while national&#13;
authorities have maintained their full and active support&#13;
4. Institutional capacity will    Low         *  Institutional strengthening components of the project will build&#13;
be strengthened                                   up the normative, regulatory and technical capacity of public&#13;
entities involved&#13;
-  The management contract with a private operator will&#13;
introduce sound management practices&#13;
5. Tariff levels will be        Medium        .  Tariff levels have been adjusted twice before loan approval&#13;
adjusted in a timely manner                   *  Tariff increases are clearly defined in the Contract Plan in line&#13;
with the present adjustment formula&#13;
*  Investments are divided into packages with investments for the&#13;
last two years tied to satisfactory compliance with mid-term&#13;
targets&#13;
6. Payment culture will be        Low         *  Willingness-to-pay studies conducted during project&#13;
improved, and                                     preparation show that users would pay substantially more if&#13;
billing/collection and                            service is improved&#13;
unaccounted-for-water                         *  Commercial practices will be carried out under the&#13;
efficiency will increase                          management of AdM by a private operator&#13;
'Likelihood that critical assumption will not be valid&#13;

interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar.  After negotiations the Government of&#13;
Venezuela selected this type of loan, with five years of grace, as part of its strategy to&#13;
reduce the risk in the debt portfolio and to limit the interest rate differential between this&#13;
loan and the subsidiary loan between the national government and AdM for the regional&#13;
component.&#13;

Estimado Sefior Preston:&#13;
Me complace saludarle con ocasi6n de hacer referencia a la uiltima misi6n adelantada entre&#13;
el Banco y autoridades venezolanas del sector agua potable y saneamiento, donde se discuneron&#13;
posibles altemativas para un cr6dito a traves de su Instituci6n.&#13;
Sobre este particular, considero de especial importancia ratificarle el inter6s del pais en&#13;
continuar con estas negociaciones. toda vez que la situaci6n de deterioro en nuestros sistemas&#13;
amerita de mejoras sustanciales tanto a nivel fisico como institucional, y obviamente de recursos&#13;
de inversi6n.&#13;
Como es de su conocimiento, desde 1990 el Estado Venezolano ha venido realizando&#13;
esfuerzos para lograr la reestructuraci6n de los servicios, a fin de que los mismos sean trasferidos&#13;
a los gobiemos locales y logren autofinanciar en una primera etapa los costos de operaci6n y&#13;
mantenimiento. Sin embargo,. los problemas de indole financiero y politico que han acosado a&#13;
nuestro pais en los ultimos afios no han permitido que el proceso cumpla todas sus metas.&#13;
No obstante, hemos tenido logros importantes por cuanto fue suprimida la gesti6n&#13;
centralizada del servicio, al liquidarse el Instituto Nacional de Obras Sanitarias (INOS) y crearse&#13;
diez Empresas Hidrol6gicas Regionales con funciones operativas y autonomia financiera, y una&#13;
empresa matriz Hidroven, con caricter de Compafiia An6nima, con funciones de planificaci6n&#13;
y regulaci6n. En el area comercial, a partir de la creaci6n de las Empresas Hidrol6gicas&#13;
Regionales y hasta el presente ailo la recaudaci6n se increment6 en un 580%, y se logr6&#13;
aumentar el precio de venta promedio del metro cubico de agua de 2.22 Bs. a 18,11 Bs. Con&#13;
relaci6n al numero de empleados por conexi6n se pas6 de 9,84 empleados por 1000 conexiones&#13;
en 1991 a 6,15 en 1994, incluyendo este ultimo valor los empleados directos e indirectos de las&#13;
Empresas Hidrol6gicas.&#13;
Por otra-pirte, las reiteradas crisis del servicio, aunadas a los problemas fiscales del pais,&#13;
han llevado al Ejecutivo a darle una mayor importancia al problema del suministro de agua&#13;

Naturales Penovables&#13;
potable y saneamiento, por lo cual se elabor6 un Programa de Ajuste Sectorial para los pr6ximos&#13;
cinco anios, enmarcado dentro del Plan de Estabilizaci6n y Recuperaci6n Econ6mica Nacional.&#13;
En dicho Programa se establecen los elementos basicos de la politica del sector, que son:&#13;
- Siguiendo los lineamientos generales de Reforma del Estado, se profundiza el proceso de&#13;
descentralizaci6n del servicio, tomando las medidas necesarias para que el mismo sea prestado,&#13;
una vez transferido a los gobiemos locales, en condiciones de calidad y eficiencia. Esto permitira&#13;
consolidar estructuralmente las instituciones del sector, por cuanto se definen los roles de cada&#13;
uno de los niveles de gobierno participantes. Asi , el nivel central se especializa en sus&#13;
funciones reguladoras y de asistencia tecnica al sector, los gobiemos estadales participan en el&#13;
financiamiento de inversiones y en la cogesti6n del servicio y los gobiernos locales asumen la&#13;
gesti6n, bien directamente 6 a traves de empresas operadoras locales donde se promueve la&#13;
participaci6n del sector privado.&#13;
Todo lo anterior requiere obviamente de un marco regulador que se establecera en una&#13;
Ley para la prestaci6n del servicio, y la cual, entre otros aspectos, dara caracter legal a un ente&#13;
regulador nacional con potestad normativa, autonomia de gesti6n y con capacidad de intervenir&#13;
y sancionar a los fines de ejercer la fiscalizaci6n del servicio. Este nuevo marco regulador&#13;
tambien debera establecer en forma clara f6rmulas de estimulo para la participaci6n privada.&#13;
- Otra politica fundamental es el ordenamiento en la captaci6n y uso de los recursos&#13;
rinancieros para el sector, lo cual implica entre otras cosas lograr elevar la participaci6n de las&#13;
inversiones sectoriales de un 0,05% para 1994 a un 4% de la inversi6n publica nacional, a&#13;
traves de la participaci6n de los municipios, gobiernos estadales, sector puiblico y privado. Estos&#13;
recursos deberan fundamentalmente atender la rehabilitaci6n de los sistemas, tanto fisica como&#13;
institucional y aumentar la cobertura del servicio.&#13;
En cuanto al regimen tarifario que se aplique al servicio, el mismo debera permitir la&#13;
suficiencia financiera de los entes operadores, garantizando la recuperaci6n de los gastos de&#13;
operaci6n y mantenimiento y de las nuevas inversiones, estableciendo precios que reflejen&#13;
eficiencia, suficiencia financ.;ra y equidad. La aplicaci6n del regimen tarifario lleva implicitas&#13;
dos acciones fundamentales: por una parte un mejoramiento de los aspectos comerciales (catastro,&#13;
medicion, facturaci6n y cobranza) y por otro lado la aplicaci6n de un programa de reducci6n de&#13;
gastos orientado fundamentalmente a racionalizar el consumo de energia electrica y de sustancias&#13;
quimicas.&#13;
En aquellos casos donde se requieran subsidios, estos deberan ser directos y explicitos&#13;
al usuario, para lo cual se debera contar con el apoyo de los municipios a fin de implantar estos&#13;

WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Lessons Learned from Past Bank Experiences in the Water Sector&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Until now, Bank involvement in the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector in&#13;
Venezuela has been limited, although Bank lending for the sector in the LAC region&#13;
reached $439 million in FY 1993. Those commitments have been heavily concentrated:&#13;
Brazil accounts for 47% of commitments, Mexico for 18% and Colombia for 15 percent.&#13;
Until recently, WS&amp;S was viewed as a "social sector," with primary emphasis placed on&#13;
management from the central government and investments in expanding coverage rather&#13;
than assuring cost-recovery. Now many Latin American countries are moving towards&#13;
decentralization of services to regional and local authorities and increased attention to&#13;
rehabilitation and improved maintenance. This is a response to excessive drains on central&#13;
government resources, and a recognition that the quality and efficiency of services can&#13;
improve as management is brought closer to consumer demands at the local levels and&#13;
maintenance is properly done. Such decentralization efforts have also provided propitious&#13;
grounds for participation of the private sector in service operation and maintenance&#13;
(management contracts), and in some cases, investment (through long term concession&#13;
arrangements). The Venezuela Water and Sewerage Decentralization project for the state&#13;
of Monagas fully embodies the Bank's new policies for the WS&amp;S sector, as well as the&#13;
Latin American movement towards decentralization and innovative approaches to water&#13;
resources management. Lessons learned from past WS&amp;S operations in Argentina, Chile,&#13;
Brazil and other countries have helped to refine the design of this project, and are&#13;
presented below.&#13;
Fostering Financial Autonomy in a Regional/Local Water Agency: The Chile&#13;
Example&#13;
2.    Several experiences show that decentralization to a local or regional water agency&#13;
offers few advantages if the dependence on central govermment budgets for a large share&#13;
of investment needs and/or operation and maintenance costs is maintained. Such financial&#13;
dependence offers a disincentive for regional/local agencies to operate efficiently and&#13;
reduce costs. Political pressures that prevent the application of a tariff policy also hurt the&#13;
utility's ability to provide reliable service and appropriate coverage, often at the expense&#13;
of the poor who are left unconnected. They in tum must resort to altemative strategies&#13;
that often prove much costlier than would a simple connection to the network with an&#13;
enforced monthly tariff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
3.    In Chile, the water supply sector benefits from a strong adherence to the principles&#13;
of cost-recovery with full marginal cost pricing. Financially independent regional water&#13;
companies receive no central government transfers, and must generate the resources&#13;
necessary to finance new investments. The government acts as a regulator through the&#13;
Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios, which approves tariff levels proposed by&#13;
agencies. This regulatory framework is neutral, and public and private water companies&#13;
must meet the same quality and efficiency requirements. As a result, both quality and&#13;
coverage of water services are high in that country, while central government resources&#13;
are not drained. The proposed project for Monagas places strong emphasis on helping the&#13;
new decentralized water agency, Aguas de Monagas, achieve financial self-sufficiency&#13;
through improved cost-recovery policies and an appropriate regulatory framework for&#13;
tariff-setting and efficiency monitoring.&#13;
Private Sector Participation: The Buenos Aires and Caracas Experiences&#13;
4.    Private sector participation in the management of water and sanitation services is&#13;
increasingly seen as a desirable alternative to weighty and inefficient public management.&#13;
The latter typically depends on central government transfers to finance its operations as it&#13;
is unable to gather the political will to enforce water tariffs. Publicly managed utilities are&#13;
often overstaffed, and cash-flow problems translate into poor service and deteriorating&#13;
infrastructure. Contracts with efficient private enterprises appropriately regulated by the&#13;
public sector provide a solution to the problems of deficient and deficitary service and&#13;
deterioration of assets.&#13;
5.    Recently, the Bank has supported efforts to transfer the operation, maintenance,&#13;
and investment responsibilities for WS&amp;S services in Caracas and Buenos Aires to private&#13;
enterprises.  In a 25-30 years concession arrangements, the concessionaire enterprise&#13;
would assume all commercial and most financial risks, while fixed assets would remain&#13;
owned by the government.&#13;
6.    The two experiences have widely differed. In Caracas, the bid failed due to several&#13;
factors: i) a lack of political commitment and of good working relationships among the&#13;
municipalities of the Caracas metropolitan area impeded the successful regulation of the&#13;
contract, and implementation of the concession; ii) existing tariffs were well beneath the&#13;
level necessary to cover operating costs, and yet strong public demonstrations taking place&#13;
at the time against gasoline price increases made it difficult for the authorities to raise&#13;
water tariffs; iii) the negotiations process allowed little flexibility once the contract would&#13;
be awarded; iv) information on the system's commercial performance, the condition of&#13;
the assets and requirements for rehabilitation and investment was scant, and no significant&#13;
effort was made to upgrade it before the bid; and v) under the Venezuelan law, investors&#13;
are not protected against exchange rate changes.&#13;
7.    By contrast, the Buenos Aires concessioning experience has been relatively&#13;
successful, although it is too early to judge its operational and financial results. Argentina&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
had several advantages over Venezuela: i) the average tariff in that city already covered&#13;
operational and maintenance costs, which enabled bidders to offer even lower rates rather&#13;
than have to confront the political difficulties of raising water rates; and ii) it benefits from&#13;
foreign exchange risk law that protects investors. Moreover, the Argentinean government&#13;
had mobilized strong political will for the project, and with World Bank support, spent&#13;
resources on preparation work to diagnose the state of the system and service, and to&#13;
identify potential investors in advance.&#13;
8.    The proposed project will involve the private sector in the management of the&#13;
service through a management contract rather than a full concession, in order to achieve a&#13;
smoother transition towards private delivery of the service. In the context of project&#13;
preparation, one of the most significant achievements of local authorities - and&#13;
demonstration of their commitment - has been the increase in tariffs from 17 Bs./m3 to 40&#13;
Bs./m3, and the planning of an additional increase to 60 Bs. before the end of the year,&#13;
which makes the management of the service much more attractive to a prospective private&#13;
operator.&#13;
Institutional Readiness for Increased Responsibilities at the Regional/local level&#13;
9.    The process of decentralization depends for its success on the adequate&#13;
preparation of the local and/or regional authorities to whom responsiblities are delegated.&#13;
In several countries, such as Argentina, Brazil and Columbia, the implementation of&#13;
decentralization plans overlooked the lack of preparation of the local entities, causing&#13;
additional difficulties in the transfer process. The above-cited case of Caracas, where local&#13;
authorities could not reach consensus on the aims to work towards, illustrates this as well.&#13;
In many cases, this can be circumvented by relying at the outset on private sector&#13;
participation rather than on local public agencies, although the Caracas example shows&#13;
that agreement on this between local leaders is crucial. Transferring responsibilities to a&#13;
weak local entity can jeopardize service quality and efficiency from the beginning, which in&#13;
turn undermines the public's trust and reduces the entity's ability to justify tariff increases&#13;
and/or firmer cost-recovery policies.  The proposed project will finance technical&#13;
assistance to the local authorities for the implementation of sector reforms and the&#13;
contracting and supervision of a private operator.&#13;
Rural Water Supply: The Colombia Example&#13;
10.   Successful projects in Colombia and Bolivia have demonstrated the usefulness of&#13;
linking community participation with project design to ensure better user responsibility for&#13;
operation and maintenance, and better satisfaction of user needs at appropriate prices.&#13;
Colombia now has the reputation of having the best rural water supply program in Latin&#13;
America, as a result of a successful program sponsored by the National Institute of Public&#13;
Health which fostered community-managed water systems. Colombia's National Institute&#13;
of Public Health provides technical assistance to communities for project design as well as&#13;
community organization for water system management, while the community raises funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
and provides materials, labor, transport and cash for construction, and subsequently&#13;
operates, maintains and regulates the system through its water administrative committee.&#13;
This provides a useful model for the Rural Rehabilitation and Participatory Management&#13;
Program in the Monagas Water project, which aims to involve communities in the&#13;
preparation and implementation of community-based rehabilitation and improvement&#13;
plans, and to transfer the operation and maintenance of rural water systems to community-&#13;
elected water committees.&#13;
Water Resources Management: Chile, Venezuela and Brazil Experiences&#13;
I.   The proposed project will include in its national institutional component a program&#13;
to organize the management of the region's resources at the river basin level through an&#13;
Umbrella Association of Users (Confederaci6n de Usuarios) that would convene all water&#13;
users (farmers, municipalities, private users, the state water company AdM, industrialists,&#13;
etc.), to make decisions on water allocation and pollution control in the state of Monagas.&#13;
This model has been pioneered in Germany and Spain at the beginning of the century and&#13;
in the financial aspects in France in the late 1960s. It is now being replicated with&#13;
adjustments in several Latin American countries. Management institutions of this type&#13;
have been created in Venezuela (Lago de Valencia and Rio Tuy "Autoridades Unicas de&#13;
Area") and in Brazil (Sao Paulo and Ceara states). In Chile, the allocation of the&#13;
resources is now carried out through a water market.&#13;
12.   With the exception of the water market in Chile, it is too early to assess the&#13;
experience of these new institutions in Latin America, but initial developments suggest&#13;
that they benefit from better management and increased participation of user groups in&#13;
selecting priorities and planning investments. In the case of Venezuela, the Agencias&#13;
Ulnicas de Area have improved the management of water resources in the areas under&#13;
their jurisdiction.   However, they have had difficulties in implementing a truly&#13;
decentralized management system and remain fully dependent from central government&#13;
transfers for their functioning. The Agencias represent an enduring financial burden for&#13;
the central Government, and this has highlighted the need to develop their financial self-&#13;
sufficiency through more reliable cost-recovery mechanisms.  In the context of the&#13;
proposed project, the new scheme will place emphasis on applying appropriate water&#13;
charges that will enable the Confederaci6n to achieve financial autonomy from the central&#13;
Government in the medium term.&#13;
Major Lessons Learned from Past Experiences in Bank Lending in the Sector&#13;
13.   The above examples illustrate some of the experiences that have been useful in&#13;
formulating the project concept and design. Combined with additional analysis of past&#13;
Bank operations from the OED and the 1993 World Bank Policy Paper on Water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
Resources Management, they yield the following major lessons for this and future projects&#13;
in the sector:'&#13;
*  WS&amp;S agencies that rely less on government involvement and more on a clear&#13;
regulatory framework to guide private/user participation in service delivery&#13;
function better. The proposed project will help in clarifying the regulatory and&#13;
involving the private sector and user groups in the management of water&#13;
services;&#13;
*  Borrowers' executing  agencies greatly  benefit from  additional training&#13;
(intersectoral management, fee structure administration) and information&#13;
dissemination to improve their ability to implement the project and monitor its&#13;
performance. The proposed project will assist in training and information&#13;
dissemination through the national institutional strengthening component;&#13;
*  Emphasis should be placed on strengthening O&amp;M  capacities before new&#13;
investments are financed. The proposed project places strong emphasis on the&#13;
improvement in management of WS&amp;S services and infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation rather than expansion;&#13;
*  Emphasis on efficiency and adequate water pricing will help to address inequity&#13;
issues related to the poor's access to WS&amp;S services. Water pricing has been&#13;
efficiently addressed during project preparation and will continue to be a&#13;
priority for the new water agency in Monagas,&#13;
*  Where possible, emphasis should be given to private pumping and small scale&#13;
systems managed by users. The proposed project will achieve this through the&#13;
Rural Rehabilitation and Participatory Management Program, which will - on&#13;
the basis of community demand - finance community-based sub-projects and&#13;
transfer the O&amp;M and cost-recovery responsibilities to communities,&#13;
*  An enabling institutional envirornment with consensus among main political&#13;
entities is key to the successful development and implementation of a project;&#13;
sustained Bank supervision and assistance to executing agencies in complying&#13;
with Bank directives and requirements is essential to ensure the integrity of the&#13;
project concept and its satisfactory execution and. The project includes close&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Regulatory Framework Arrangements&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Although the structural adjustment reforms initiated in 1989 in Venezuela included&#13;
the restructuring of Water Supply and Sanitation (WS&amp;S) services by abolishing INOS -&#13;
the government-owned national WS&amp;S agency - to create regional water companies, these&#13;
services remain de facto highly centralized with a complex organizational structure.&#13;
Moreover, the regulatory framework is undeveloped and ill-defined with overlapping&#13;
statutory responsibilities among the many water-related agencies. As part of the above&#13;
reforms, in 1991, a new national institution was created for the implementation of policy&#13;
and the coordination of the sector, HIDROVEN. At the same time, ten regional water&#13;
companies (HIDROS), wholly owned subsidiaries of HIDROVEN, were established to&#13;
provide this service, as a transitory decentralized arrangement until municipal or regional&#13;
companies could be set up. However, both HIDROVEN and the HIDROS have in reality&#13;
acted as regional branches of the Central Government. Although the Municipalities hold&#13;
constitutional responsibility for water supply and sewerage, the HIDROS have operated&#13;
the services under informal concession agreements (see Figure 1). This process has&#13;
resulted in a situation where responsibilities are undertaken in an informal manner, without&#13;
legal or administrative backing, by many of the institutions involved in the sector.&#13;
2     In 1992, authorities at the state and municipal level in Monagas initiated a local&#13;
reform process to increase the efficiency of water supply and sanitation services through&#13;
further decentralization. The state's ten municipalities first formed the Mancomunidad&#13;
Monaguense de Acueductos, in an effort to better coordinate water-related initiatives.&#13;
The Mancomunidad then associated with the state government to create Aguas de&#13;
Monagas (AdM), a new company that would gradually take over the service&#13;
responsibilities from HIDROCARIBE-Monagas, the local HIDRO. Fifty-one percent of&#13;
the company's capital is owned by the Municipalities, and the remaining forty-nine is&#13;
owned by the State. Until recently, AdM was only a legally created shell with no formal&#13;
operational responsibilities. In the context of project preparation, however, the process of&#13;
transferring functions to AdM has accelerated, highlighting some legal issues that are key&#13;
to the sector's decentralization activities.&#13;
Key Legal Issues&#13;
3.    The legal issues that could represent the main constraints for project&#13;
implementation and AdM's proper functioning have been analyzed by the Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;

with the assistance of the Bank. They include: (i) AdM's legal status; (ii) the assignment&#13;
of the responsibility for the provision of WS&amp;S services and the production of water; (iii)&#13;
the authority and procedures for setting and adjusting tariffs; and (iv) the mechanisms to&#13;
channel funds for project implementation.&#13;

4.    The resolution of these issues has formed the basis for several contracts and&#13;
agreements between the involved institutions in order to:-  i) improve the current&#13;
undeveloped regulatory framework and clarify institutional roles; ii) allow the proper&#13;
operation of AdM;- and iii) facilitate project implementation.  The contracts and&#13;
agreements have been prepared during project preparation to define and regulate the&#13;
relationships among the Government of Venezuela, the Ministry of Environment and&#13;
Natural Renewable Resources (MARNR), HIDROCARIBE (the regional HIDRO&#13;
responsible for service provision in Monagas), the state of Monagas (Gobernacion), the&#13;
Municipalities and AdM. This set of contracts and agreements is intended to complement,&#13;
in an inter-im way, the existing regulatory framework until the more developed regulatory&#13;
framework that will result from the the project's national institutional component is in&#13;
place. At the same time, it will serve as a demonstration exercise, to test the viability and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
requirements that should satisfy the regulatory framework under preparation. This annex&#13;
presents each of the above-mentioned issues and the resulting legal agreements that will&#13;
enable the Government to move forward with this demonstration decentralization project.&#13;
5.    AdM's Legal Status.   Neither AdM's bylaws, nor the Venezuelan legal&#13;
framework, clearly establish the type of company AdM is (private company, public&#13;
company, municipal company) and which legal code it should follow in its operation. This&#13;
is critical with respect to accounting obligations, to the possibility of receiving transfer of&#13;
funds from Central Government under the project, to the obligations it might acquire as&#13;
part of the project legal terms and to its contractual relations either with the users or&#13;
among the share-holders of the company, particularly regarding the Mancomunidad and its&#13;
role as representative of the municipalities.&#13;
6.    As a result of the legal studies carried out, it seems that the statutes of AdM and&#13;
the Mancomunidad provide that: (i) AdM could be considered a municipal company that&#13;
operates under normal commercial practices;  and (ii) the Mancomunidad could&#13;
collectively represent the municipalities as shareholders of this company and take in their&#13;
name decisions on the normal functioning. The signing of this ratification was a condition&#13;
of negotiations.&#13;
7.    Responsibility for providing the WS&amp;S service. Although Municipalities hold&#13;
constitutional responsibility to provide WS&amp;S services, several other institutions had been&#13;
in charge of the delivery of this service and had to be involved in the transfer of&#13;
responsibility to AdM. In order to have AdM taking over the service in an orderly and&#13;
regulated way, the current practice and the legal opinion consulted has indicated that it is&#13;
necessary that, regulated under specific contracts and agreements, provisions are&#13;
established for AdM receiving (see Figure 2):&#13;
(a)   the legal title to provide the servicefrom the Municipalities,&#13;
(b)   the right to produce potable water and use the infrastructure that belongs&#13;
to the national governmentfrom MARNR; and&#13;
(c)   the infrastructure and  responsibility to  provide the  service firom&#13;
HIDROCARIBE.&#13;
8.    A Service Contract between AdM and each municipality is the legal agreement&#13;
which will authorize AdM to provide the WS&amp;S services. Under this service contract the&#13;
municipalities delegate to AdM in all their rights and assignments regarding the provision&#13;
of the service. This contract: (i) expressly entitles AdM to contract totally or partially the&#13;
provision of the service, with the obligation to inform the municipality; (ii) establishes that&#13;
the tariff revenue must cover operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, investment&#13;
and improvement costs, and debt service;  (iii) entitles AdM  to propose to the&#13;
municipalities the regulation of the service and establishes that the municipalities must&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
issue, according to this proposal, the needed regulation regarding the obligations and&#13;
rights of the users and those of AdM. Eight municipalities have to date signed the Service&#13;
Contract, including among them Maturin, and the two other largest ones. Submission of&#13;
signed copies of the Service Contracts satisfactory to the Bank was condition of&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
9.    In addition, a Comodatum Agreement has been reached between AdM  and&#13;
MARNR, that cedes to AdM the right to use the infrastructure for the production of&#13;
drinking water in the state of Monagas. Indeed, in order to obtain an integrated&#13;
framework where water-related responsibilities are consolidated under one institution,&#13;
both water production and service provision will be taken over by AdM. The agreement&#13;
defines the obligations and rights of both AdM and MARNR. In particular, it establishes&#13;
that: (i) MARNR agrees not to grant new concessions for the use of water in the state of&#13;
Monagas without the technical advice of AdM; (ii) that MARNR retains general control&#13;
and supervision powers on water resources management, on a transitional basis, until the&#13;
Users' Confederation is established (see Annex I, which provides a detailed description of&#13;
the proposed institutional framework for water resources management); and (iii) AdM has&#13;
the capacity to contract with third parties the operation or maintenance of the&#13;
infrastructure for the production of potable water. Submission of a signed copy of the&#13;
Comodatum Agreement satisfactory to the Bank was condition of negotiations.&#13;
10.   Finally, a Service Transfer Agreement has been signed between HIDROCARIBE&#13;
and AdM  for the transfer of responsibilities, assets and personnel.   Although&#13;
Municipalities hold constitutional responsibility for the provision of this service, it has&#13;
been de facto provided  by HIDROCARIBE; therefore this agreement regulates the&#13;
transfer of responsibility to AdM and cedes the right to use the infrastructure. This&#13;
agreement will also regulate different aspects of this transfer regarding obligations,&#13;
pending contracts, debts and assets.  Submission of the signed Service Transfer&#13;
Agreement satisfactory to the Bank was condition of negotiations.&#13;
11.   Aside from the above agreements, which give AdM the legal rights to provide&#13;
water and sanitation services and to produce water, two additional legal instruments will&#13;
be used to ensure the proper operation and delivery of service by AdM. First, to formalize&#13;
the definition of performance expectations for AdM, a Contract Plan will be signed&#13;
between AdM and its stockholders, which defines the responsibilities of each party (AdM,&#13;
state of Monagas, and the Mancomunidad) and the performance targets for AdM. The&#13;
main elements of the Contract Plan are: (i) the preservation of AdM management&#13;
autonomy; (ii) the obligation of AdM to achieve specific performance targets; and (iii) the&#13;
authorization for AdM to interrupt the provision of service in the case of non-payment.&#13;
Submission of a draft Contract Plan was condition of negotiations. As a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness. the Contract Plan shall have been signed by AdM. the state of Monagas&#13;
government and all municipalities in the state of Monagas which have authorized to&#13;
operate under a signed service contract (this includes all municipalities, except Cedenio).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
As condition of disbursements for urban rehabilitation investments in Cedenio or any new&#13;
municipality, such municipality shall sign the Contract Plan&#13;
12.   Second, because the main problems of HIDROCARIBE are related to poor&#13;
management practices and as a result of policy discussions on the optimal manner of&#13;
involving the private sector, it has ben decided that a Management Contract would be&#13;
established between AdM and a private operator to manage the services over a period of&#13;
four years (described in detail in Annex E). Until now billing, collections and supervision&#13;
of service contracts has been deficient. Moreover, little management capacity exists in&#13;
public sector agencies. These factors have contributed to the decision to hire a private&#13;
operator for the management of water supply and sanitation services in the state of&#13;
Monagas. The Management Contract will be awarded through an international&#13;
competition in accordance with Bank guidelines for the hiring of Consultants, and financed&#13;
under the project. The main characteristics of this contract are that: (i) it is a contract&#13;
based on management incentives, which gives the operator full responsibility for the&#13;
commercial system of AdM and for the management of the investment plan financed under&#13;
the project, (ii) it uses the performance targets corresponding to those established in the&#13;
Contract Plan between AdM and its stockholders, and (iii) it defines the compensation&#13;
system, which will consist of a fixed retainer payment, to be financed by the project, and a&#13;
variable payment and two bonuses contingent on substantial improvements superior to the&#13;
performance targets and the achievement of key management targets. These variable&#13;
payments will be financed and limited by the income those improvements generate for&#13;
AdM. As a condition of negotiations AdM has issued the letter of invitation for the&#13;
management contract bid. Signing of the management contract will be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for the second rehabilitation investment package.&#13;
13.   Tariffs Setting and Adjustment Authority.  The legal basis for water tariff&#13;
setting like many other regulatory aspects of the sector is not totally clear. According to&#13;
the Law for the Protection of Consumers, the Ministry of Development (MF) and the&#13;
MARNR seem to have the authority and responsibility to regulate WS&amp;S tariffs. Based&#13;
on this Law, tariff levels and structures were established in 1993 by a joint decree of both&#13;
ministries, that included a procedure for the automatic adjustment of tariffs according to&#13;
changes in the basic costs of the service. Also, HIDROVEN's approval of tariff changes&#13;
have been until now necessary in the name of the MF and the MARNR before they could&#13;
be implemented by the HIDROS.&#13;
14.   To overcome the rigidity of this procedure, which could imply a risk for AdM's&#13;
financial viability, the average residential tariff reference rate has been raised to 40 Bs/m3&#13;
before project appraisal and will be raised to 60 Bs/m3 before loan effectiveness.&#13;
HIDROVEN approved these adjustments and the application of the procedure for&#13;
automatic adjustment of tariffs according to changes in the costs of the service.&#13;
Additionally, the results of the legal studies carried out during project preparation on this&#13;
subject indicate that, once the service has been taken over by AdM in the name of the&#13;
municipalities, even though tariffs must still comply with the regulations of the Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
Finance and the- MARNR, the authority to set tariffs resides in the municipalities,&#13;
represented by the Mancomunidad because: (i) WS&amp;S services are a constitutionally&#13;
established municipal responsibility; and (ii) WS&amp;S tariffs are a public price and not a&#13;
"tasa"'. Submission of evidence that tariffs adjustments have been aproved and&#13;
implemented will be a condition of loan effectiveness. Satisfactory compliance with the&#13;
physical. operating and finncial targets established under the Contract Plan will be a&#13;
condition of disbursement of funds for the third package of rehabilitation investments.&#13;

15.    Mechanisms for channeling loan funds. The Venezuelan authorities and the&#13;
project preparation team, with the assistance of a legal consultant, have defined&#13;
mechanisms to ensure an efficient, decentralized flow of funds from the Central&#13;
Government to AdM for the execution of the regional components of the project. Until&#13;
now any funds from the Central Government were channeled through HIDROVEN to the&#13;
HIDROS. Under the new institutional framework, and to effect decentralization, AdM&#13;
' Charge imposed by a public entity for the delivery of a service that is compulsorily given and taken by&#13;
the individuals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
will receive loan funds directly from the Central Bank. It was agreed that starting in 1996,&#13;
the Ministry of Environment will give payment orders to channel funds directly from the&#13;
Central Bank to AdM for the components it will execute. HIDROVEN, as executor of&#13;
the national institutional component, will also receive funds from the Central Bank upon&#13;
order of the Ministry of Environment.&#13;
16.   As a result, two specific agreements between AdM, the Ministry of Finance and&#13;
HIDROVEN for defining responsibilities among involved institutions and regulating the&#13;
transfer of funds will be signed: (i) the Subsidiary Agreement between the national&#13;
government (through the Ministry of Finance and MARNR), HIDROVEN and AdM to&#13;
(a) transfer loan proceeds, on a reimbursable basis, to AdM for the institutional&#13;
development of AdM and the three rehabilitation packages for urban areas under the&#13;
regional component, (b) transfer loan proceeds, on a grant basis, to AdM for the rural&#13;
rehabilitation subcomponent, and (c) transfer loan proceeds, on a grant basis, to&#13;
HIDROVEN for the national institutional component; and (ii) the Trust Fund Operating&#13;
Agreement among AdM and a Fiduciary Bank, for delineating the terms and conditions&#13;
under which the Fiduciary Bank shall administer all funds to be provided for the financing&#13;
of the regional component. The Trust Fund Operating Agreement will clearly delineate&#13;
the responsibilities of AdM, the state government, the Municipalities, and the Ministries of&#13;
Finance and MARNR, use of funds, financial contributions, corresponding schedule and&#13;
terms and conditions under which the Fiduciary Bank shall administer such financial&#13;
contributions.  Submission of a draft Trust Fund Operating Agreement and draft&#13;
Subsidiary Loan and Grant Agreements satisfactory to the Bank were condition of&#13;
negotiations. Submission to the Bank of signed copies of these Agreements will be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness.&#13;
Summary and conclusion&#13;
17.   The contracts and agreements that have resulted from the resolution of the legal&#13;
issues derived from the decentralization and project preparation process can hence be&#13;
grouped in two types: (i) those that regulate the operation of AdM, and (ii) those regulate&#13;
the implementation of the project.&#13;
18.   To regulate the operation of AdM five contracts and agreements will be or have&#13;
been signed by AdM (see Figure 3):&#13;
(a)   The Service Transfer Agreement between HIDROCARIBE and AdM for&#13;
the transfer of responsibilities, assets and personnel;&#13;
(b)   the Comodatum Agreement between AdM  and MARNR that cedes to&#13;
AdM the right to use the infrastructure for the production of drinking&#13;
water in the State of Monagas;&#13;

prepared and will be signed before effectiveness:&#13;
(a)   the Subsidiary Agreement between the national government (through the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and MARNR), HIDROVEN and AdM to (a) transfer&#13;

development of AdM and the three rehabilitation packages for urban areas&#13;
under the regional component; (b) transfer loan proceeds, on a grant basis,&#13;

20.   The legal agreements presented above will enable the project to go forward now,&#13;
taking advantage of the strong motivation existing among officials at the central and local&#13;
government levels. Since these agreement have been developed in coordination with the&#13;
analyses currently under way to develop a new regulatory framework for the sector in&#13;
Venezuela, they are not likely to be upset by the implementation of the reformed&#13;
framework.&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Willingness to pay for improved Water and Sanitation Services&#13;
Introduction: Rationale for a Willingness-to-pay Study&#13;
I.    The provision of water supply and sanitation (WS&amp;S) services in Venezuela is largely&#13;
subsidized by the central government, which until now has born the increasing weight of the&#13;
investment and operating costs of the W&amp;S service without making any major attempts at cost-&#13;
recovery. Under the decentralization approach to be tested in Monagas, a local authority will take&#13;
over the responsibility for service provision, setting tariffs and carrying out billing and collection.&#13;
The major challenge for the newly formed water company, Aguas de Monagas (AdM), will be to&#13;
align historically low tariffs with the trus cost of service and to become a financially self-sufficient&#13;
utility.&#13;
2.    In order to meet this challenge, and to define acceptable service tariffs, it is important to&#13;
predict user willingness-to-pay and its determinants.  This annex describes the household&#13;
willingness to pay (WTP) study that was performed in Maturin, the capital city of the State of&#13;
Monagas, during the period of June 2-30, 1995, in preparation for the transfer of facilities to AdM&#13;
and the improvement of Maturin's water and sewer systems. This study has proven essential to i)&#13;
establish support among local policy-makers for a more rigorous approach to WS&amp;S services&#13;
management that relies on user contribution; ii) confirm the emphasis of project design on water&#13;
supply infrastructure improvement and rehabillitation; and iii) ratify tariff increase&#13;
recommendations resulting from the financial analyses carried out during project preparation. The&#13;
study also sheds much needed light on customer concerns over current service, and preferences&#13;
and priorities for the future improvements to the system, thereby providing policy-makers and the&#13;
project preparation team with a clear sense of priorities to be addressed.&#13;
Summary and Conclusions'&#13;
3.    In summary, results indicate that 85% of respondents would use an improved water supply&#13;
system (without improvements in sanitation) at an average monthly price of 1,000 Bs (US$ 5.88),&#13;
63% would use it at an average monthly price of 4,000 Bs. (US$23.5), and only 35% would use it&#13;
at an average monthly price of 7,000 Bs. (US$41). The study found that the variables which are&#13;
most statistically significant to explain willingness-to-pay results are price, income, and education.&#13;
The level of satisfaction with current level of service and the gender of the respondent were not&#13;
statistically significant variables. Given the demand probabilities derived from the study to project&#13;
revenues from water billing, an average monthly price of 5,000 Bs. constitutes a threshold beyond&#13;
which expected revenues would decrease.&#13;
' This and subsequent sections are adapted from the preliminary and draft final reports submitted by Donald T.&#13;
Lauria, Jennifer Davis and Elizabeth Mclelland from CVM, Inc. a U.S. firm which carried out the study herein&#13;
described with DOXA, a Venezuelan firm specializing in public opinion surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 2 of 13&#13;
4.     Three observations are in order. The first is that demand for improved water supply in&#13;
Maturin is quite high; for example, about 70% of the households are willing to pay about US$200&#13;
per year. In the face of such demand, a strong case cannot be made for external subsidies. The&#13;
second observation is that this high demand is for the type of improved system described to&#13;
respondents in the questionnaire, i.e., a system similar to those in Europe and North America. If&#13;
such a system cannot be created, it is unlikely that the demand reported herein would exist for an&#13;
alternative system with lower quality.&#13;
5.     Finally, household demand is mainly for improved water quality and reliability; hence, if&#13;
the investment criterion is to satisfy existing consumer preferences, then upgrading the water&#13;
system should take priority over wastewater removal and treatment. The fact that water quality is&#13;
viewed as a greater priority than is the quantity of water provided should not be interpreted to&#13;
mean that construction of water treatment facilities should take priority over rehabilitating the&#13;
water distribution network. The single most important step toward improving water quality may&#13;
be to ensure the reliable distribution of water 24 hours per day under positive network pressure.&#13;
6.     To conclude, the study achieved three important objectives: (i) it provided input on the&#13;
views and preferences of service users to policy-makers at the local and national level in&#13;
Venezuela as well as to the Bank, and this input proved essential in the context of stakeholder&#13;
workshops held during project preparation; (ii) by showing user preferences and levels of&#13;
satisfaction with the existing service, the study confirmed the appropriateness of the project&#13;
emphasis on water supply infrastructure rehabilitation to improve the quality of water and service;&#13;
and (iii) by yielding high WTP figures for average monthly prices of 2,000 Bs. and above, the&#13;
study showed the financial viability of the project, indeed, the planned tariff increase from the&#13;
current 40 to 60 Bs./m3 will amount to an average monthly price of 1,800 Bs. (US$ 10.60)2.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
7.     Focus Groups and Questionnaire Design. As a first step for the questionnaire design,&#13;
three focus group meetings' were held, each with ten to twenty participants from different&#13;
neighborhoods corresponding to different socioeconomic backgrounds in the city. Discussions&#13;
aimed to collect preliminary information from water and sanitation users on service quality and&#13;
level of satisfaction with the service, alternative water supply sources (e.g. private back-up&#13;
arrangements), billing and collection procedures, and amounts spent by households on water and&#13;
other public services. Participants were also given an opportunity to react to the proposed&#13;
institutional and service changes planned under the project, and to trial prices for tariffs to be&#13;
charged under the improved scheme. The information resulting from focus group discussion was&#13;
used to develop a first draft of the household questionnaire.  In addition, the focus group&#13;
discussions comprised a valuable participatory tool to elicit preliminary information on user&#13;
preferences, level of satisfaction and willingness-to-pay, which was essential for the discussions&#13;
with stakeholders and policy-makers held during project preparation.&#13;
2 Using an average household consumption level of 30m3/month.&#13;
3 The focus group discussions were facilitated by Donald Lauria (CVM), Isabelle Fauconnier (the World Bank),&#13;
and Isbelia de Malave (Doxa).&#13;

8.    The questionnaire includes five sections: i) general questions about the household's&#13;
characteristics;  ii) priorities and preferences of the respondent (list includes transportation,&#13;
schooling, water supply and sanitation, marginal areas); iii) current water supply and sanitation&#13;
service and practices, iv) willingness to pay questions; and v) socio-economic information about&#13;
the respondent's household (e.g., levels of education, occupation, characteristics of the dwelling,&#13;
income and assets, expenditures and utility bills).&#13;
9.     The WTP questions presented institutional and service improvement scenarios as a basis&#13;
for contingent valuation questions inquiring aboutfavoring the scenarios if average monthly cost&#13;
to the household was X, and using the improved system at that cost. As a checking mechanism,&#13;
the questionnaire also included an open-ended question asking households what would be the&#13;
maximuim they would be willing to pay for the improved system. The questionnaire versions&#13;
included two different willingness-to-pay scenarios, one that describes improvements only to the&#13;
water supply system ("Water Only") and the other that describes improvements to both the water&#13;
and sanitation systems ("Water and Sanitation"). The scenario versions, along with the average&#13;
monthly bill amounts of 2,000 Bs. (US$11.7), 4,000 Bs. (US$23.4), 7,000 Bs. (US$41.1), or&#13;
10,000 Bs. (US$58.8)4, were randomly assigned to respondents. The willingness-to-pay section&#13;
is described in detail in paras. 18 to 31.&#13;
10.   Sample Design.  Aguas de Monagas and HIDROCARIBE provided their recently&#13;
updated city consumer data-base and cadaster, including rough information on socioeconomic&#13;
class. This provided a sound basis from which to draw a random sample of 600 households, for a&#13;
target figure of usable surveys of approximately 420 after data entry and quality control, a figure&#13;
considered robust given the number of questionnaire versions (8).  The sample included&#13;
households ranging from upper-class, fully serviced neighborhoods to unserviced marginal areas&#13;
and all levels of service in between.&#13;
11.   Enumerator training and Pre-testing.  Enumerators hired locally by DOXA were&#13;
trained in Contingent Valuation Household Survey methods during three days in Maturin.&#13;
Training included mock interviews with the study directors and field training during the&#13;
questionnaire pretesting.  Training sessions also were used to improve the organization and&#13;
language of the questionnaire. The pretest included approximately 150 households. Only a single&#13;
version of the questionnaire with two different prices (2,000 Bs. and 5,000 Bs.) was used. The&#13;
pretest provided the final range of average monthly bill amounts to be used in the survey: 2,000&#13;
Bs. to 10,000 Bs.&#13;

Findings&#13;
12.   Household Characteristics. Households have an average size of 5.4 persons. Most&#13;
households have 2 adults, one of whom works outside the home for pay. The median level of&#13;
education is the same for both the head of the house and the spouse: completion of primary&#13;
school and some secondary schooling.&#13;
All the houses surveyed have electricity and all purchase bottled gas; about half have telephones.&#13;
The median monthly payments for light, gas, and telephone are 2,000, 340, and 3,500 Bs.,&#13;
respectively. Forty percent of the households have a car, and more than 90% own both a TV and&#13;
refrigerator. Average monthly income per household is 62,500 Bs. (US$ 370), and the median&#13;
income is 50,000 Bs. (US$ 300). Self-reported incomes spanned a wide range from 6,000 to&#13;
400,000 Bs. Income distribution is detailed in table I below.&#13;
Table 1: Income categories of sample households&#13;

High                     &gt; 95,000                       16&#13;
13.   Water Supply. In the dry (summer) season, the average number of hours that water&#13;
arrives at homes each day is 16; the median is 18 hours. In summer, about half of the households&#13;
have water 24 hours per day, and 80% have it for at least 6 hours per day. In the rainy (winter)&#13;
season, houses have water from the piped system 22 hours per day on average; 86% have it 24&#13;
hours per day; and 95% have it at least 6 hours per day. These data therefore indicate a relatively&#13;
high level of water supply from the piped network in comparison with other developing countries.&#13;
However, water quality is generally deemed low. The percentages of households rating water&#13;
quality as Good, Fair, or Poor during the rainy and dry seasons are as follows:&#13;
Table 2: Respondents' perception of water quality&#13;
Quality    Rainy Season     Dry Season&#13;
Good          16%             22%&#13;
Fair         55%             64%&#13;
Poor         29%              15%&#13;
In the dry season, 30% of households drink water directly from the tap; in the rainy season this&#13;
proportion drops to 25%. Hence, water quantity is better in the rainy season than in the dry, but&#13;
water quality is better in the dry than in the rainy season. Of the households that do not drink&#13;
water directly from the tap, two thirds purify it using a filter, 24% boil it, and the remainder use&#13;
both filters and boiling.&#13;
14.   Eighty-three percent of the households obtain most of their water from the piped system in&#13;
the dry season, and 92% get most of their water from the piped system in the rainy season. Some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 5 of 13&#13;
households get water from tanker trucks and a few obtain it from neighbors. About 30% of&#13;
households buy bottled water at least occasionally; about 60% of these use it only for drinking&#13;
and the rest for both drinking and cooking. About 40% of households periodically give water to&#13;
their neighbors, but do not charge for the water. Virtually no one in the sample reported using a&#13;
public standpost or a private well.&#13;
15.   Sixty-three percent of the households with a water connection reported receiving a bill&#13;
from Hidrocaribe (25% every month, 55% every two months, and 19% once in a while). Most&#13;
(58%) said they check their bill for accuracy. Sixty percent of Households reported that they&#13;
always paid their water bill, 14% said almost always, 16% said sometimes, and 9% said never. If&#13;
true, these responses imply that slightly over one-third of all households in Maturin pay a water&#13;
bill. The median payment for the past six months was reported to be 3,000 Bs. (i.e., 500 Bs. per&#13;
month), and the average payment was 3,600 Bs. (i.e., 600 Bs. per month). The top ten percent of&#13;
households paying the largest bills contributed slightly more revenue than the 50% of households&#13;
that paid the median amount or less.&#13;
16.   Sanitation. Ninety-three percent of the respondents have a toilet and nearly half have&#13;
more than one. Sixty-eight percent of the households are connected to a piped sewer. In the dry&#13;
season, 96% of these said that their sewer almost always works well; in the rainy season, this&#13;
proportion is 93%. No households are charged for sewerage.&#13;
17.   Satisfaction, Priorities and Attitudes. Respondents were asked about satisfaction with&#13;
both their water and sanitation systems.  The percentages of households that were "Very&#13;
satisfied," "Somewhat satisfied," and "Not satisfied" were as follows:&#13;
Table 3: Respondents' satisfaction with current water supply and sanitation services&#13;
Satisfaction level         Water supply          Sanitation service&#13;
Very satisfied            20%                     53%&#13;
Somewhat satisfied           59%                     29%&#13;
Not satisfied             21%                     18%&#13;
18.   Clearly, households are much more satisfied with their sanitation service than with their&#13;
water supply. When given a list of six problems facing Maturin (3 environmental and 3 non-&#13;
environmental), improving the water supply was selected by 46% of respondents as the most&#13;
important issue to resolve. Twenty-three percent selected sanitation as the top priority, and 11%&#13;
selected improvement of solid waste collection. Hence, twice as many households selected&#13;
improvements in water supply as compared to sanitation service, which is consistent with the&#13;
results shown in Table 3. The three remaining problems (public transportation, education, and&#13;
upgrading squatter settlements) were each selected as the top priority by about 7% of&#13;
respondents. The list of problems was then reduced to only environmental issues (water supply,&#13;
sanitation, and solid wastes), and respondents were asked to select the top priority among them&#13;
(Table 4).&#13;

Solid Waste Collection                21&#13;
19.   Half the respondents think Maturin does not have a wastewater treatment plant. In fact&#13;
the city has no plant, indicating that half the residents are not well informed.  Nearly all&#13;
respondents think that Maturin sewage is contaminating the environment, is causing problems for&#13;
the city and their families, and should be treated. Two-thirds feel that household sewage and&#13;
industrial wastes are equally to blame for water pollution.&#13;
20.   Willingness to Pay. The willingness-to-pay section of each questionnaire included two&#13;
questions. The first, which followed a description of the improved service, posed a hypothetical&#13;
vote to the respondent. He or she was asked whether, as a citizen of Maturin, he/she would vote&#13;
in favor of or against the proposed improvements. The first question was:&#13;
"Suppose that a vote were taken to determine if the people of Maturin are in favor or&#13;
not in favor of this project.for improving the ("water" or "water and sanitation")&#13;
service in the city. Suppose the average cost that houses in Maturin would have to&#13;
pay were X bolivars per month (where X = 2,000, 4,000, 7, 000, or 10, 000). Would&#13;
you be in favor of this project or not?"&#13;
In the preamble to this question, respondents were told that water meters would be installed so&#13;
that payments would be based on the amount of water that households actually use. Hence, the&#13;
reference to "average cost" in the above question implies that some households would pay more&#13;
than the average and others would pay less. Because the majority of focus group participants did&#13;
not know how much water they were using, it was decided that posing willingness-to-pay&#13;
questions in terms of average monthly cost would produce more useful information than asking&#13;
about the volumetric price they would be willing to pay.&#13;
21.   A second question asked the respondent whether his or her household would use the&#13;
improved system if it cost them the same monthly price stated in the first question. Specifically, it&#13;
asked:&#13;
"Now I would like to know what you think the possibility is that you would use the&#13;
new ("water" or "water and sanitation ") service I have just described You would not&#13;
be obliged to use the new system if you do not want to. However, if you decide not to&#13;
use it, your house could not be connected to the ("water" or "water and sewer")&#13;
network, and you would have to buy water from your neighbors, or construct your&#13;
own well (or build your own septic tank).&#13;
"Now I would like to know, if this new system were installed in Maturin and the&#13;
average amount your household had to pay were approximately X bolivars per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 7 ofl3&#13;
month, would you use the new system or would you arrange to use some other&#13;
system? "&#13;
The first question is referred to as "Favor," and the second is referred to as "Use." The&#13;
proportion of households that said they favored and would use the Water Only and the Water and&#13;
Sanitation improvements are shown in Table 5; a graph of the data is provided in Figure 1.&#13;

22.   These results give a general sense of community demand for the proposed improvements.&#13;
A comparison of the Water Only with the Water and Sanitation results reveals that the proportion&#13;
of respondents who would favor or use the Water and Sanitation program equal or exceed the&#13;
corresponding proportion who would favor or use the Water Only program at every price except&#13;
one. For example, at a fee of 4,000 Bs. per month, 68% favored the Water Only plan whereas&#13;
78% favored the Water and Sanitation plan. These data are logical since for a given price, a&#13;
higher percentage of respondents would be expected to want the more complete system of Water&#13;
and Sanitation than the Water Only system. In addition, the data in the "Favor" and "Use"&#13;
columns of Table 5 show that the percentages decrease as the fees increase, which is as expected.&#13;
23.   Several  regression analyses were conducted to fit probit and logit models to the&#13;
wvillingness-to-pay data. These models were of the form Y = Bo + B I X I + ... + BnXn, where the&#13;
Xs are explanatory (independent) variables, Bo is a constant, and Y is the dependent variable, a&#13;
measure of the probability that a household will favor or use the improved system. The first&#13;
analysis pooled all the responses to the Favor question for both types of systems, Water Only and&#13;
Water and Sanitation. A full model with the following nine explanatory variables was fitted to the&#13;
data:&#13;
XI = price (i.e., fee to use the system)&#13;
X2 = log of income&#13;
X3 = education of respondent&#13;
X4 = gender of respondent&#13;
Xs = number of persons in household&#13;
X6 = I if household pays its water bill; 0 otherwise&#13;
X7 = I if household is very satisfied with its water system, 2 if somewhat&#13;
satisfied; 3 if not satisfied&#13;
X8 = I if the household chose either water or sanitation as the first or&#13;
second priority problem in Maturin; 0 otherwise&#13;
Xg = I if the questionnaire included the Water Only scenario; 0 if it included the&#13;
Water and Sanitation scenario&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 8 of 13&#13;
In the probit analysis, monthly fee (XI), the logarithm of respondent's income (X2), respondent's&#13;
education (X3), whether the respondent paid his/her water bill (X6), and version of the&#13;
questionnaire (X9) were all found to be statistically significant, but the other variables were not.&#13;
To examine the robustness of the coefficients of the statistically significant variables to an&#13;
alternative model formulation, a reduced model with only these five variables and a constant was&#13;
refitted to the data. All five variables were statistically significant, as before, but the constant was&#13;
not. The model correctly predicted 68% of the discrete household responses. The regression&#13;
result is as follows:&#13;

24.   Education and questionnaire version are significant only at the 10% level. The negative&#13;
sign of the price coefficient indicates that as price increases, the probability that a household&#13;
favors an improved system decreases, as expected. This variable is highly significant (1% level).&#13;
The posilive sign of the income coefficient indicates that households with higher income are&#13;
more likely to favor an improved system, which is a logical result. The positive sign of the&#13;
education coefficient indicates that households whose heads have more education have higher&#13;
probability of favoring an improved system, which is as expected The negative sign of the&#13;
dummy variable for questionnaire version indicates that households are more likely to favor the&#13;
Water and Sanitation scheme than the Water Only project, other things being equal.  The&#13;
significance of this variable indicates that households were able to distinguish between the two&#13;
different systems that were described to them. It is important to keep in mind that each household&#13;
was asked about only one project, either Water Only or Water and Sanitation. Hence, the&#13;
households that were asked about the Water and Sanitation project were more favorably disposed&#13;
toward it than the households that were asked about the Water Only project.&#13;

25.   Similar regression analyses were made of the responses to the question about using an&#13;
improved water and water and sanitation system. All "Use" responses were pooled for both&#13;
types of systems, Water Only and Water and Sanitation. The same nine explanatory variables&#13;
were included in the probit analysis, and four of them were found to be statistically significant:&#13;
monthly fee (XI), log of income (X2), education (X3), and whether the respondent paid his/her&#13;
water bill.  A reduced model was refitted-to the data with the four statistically significant&#13;
explanatory variables and the version variable. The model correctly predicted 73% of the discrete&#13;
household responses. The regression results are presented in Table 7.&#13;

26.   In this model, price and income are the most significant variables that explain the demand&#13;
for using an improved system. The coefficient of education has the expected sign; better educated&#13;
households are more likely to use the system than households with lower education.&#13;
&#13;

27.   Questionnaire version was statistically significant in the "Favor" model but not in this&#13;
model for "Use." This implies that other things being equal, the probability that a household&#13;
would connect to an improved Water and Sanitation system is no greater than the probability that&#13;
it would connect to a Water Only system.  This is probably explained by the fact that the&#13;
households could distinguish between the two systems, but they did not perceive the sanitation&#13;
component as being very important.  This is consistent with the observation that households in&#13;
Maturin are much more concerned about water supply than sanitation.&#13;
28.   The reduced model for using an improved system was refitted to the pooled Water Only&#13;
and Water and Sanitation data using logit analysis. The fitted logit model is:&#13;
y = -8.233 - 0.000403*Price + 0.953*ln(Income) + 0.137* Education&#13;
- 0.770*Pay Bill - 0.159* Version&#13;
The probability (p) that a household will use an improved system is calculated using the equation&#13;
p=1/[1 + exp(-y)]. To calculate this probability using the above logit model, Education and Pay&#13;
Bill were held at their mean values (3.964 and 0.570, respectively) and Version was held equal to&#13;
zero to represent the Water and Sanitation system. The results for incomes in the range 20,000-&#13;
140,000 Bs. are shown in Figure 2.&#13;

29.   Results of the probit and logit analyses are plausible and constitute the heart of this&#13;
application. Predicting household use of an improved water and sanitation system produces the&#13;
curves in Figure 2. Monthly incomes of 20,000, 50,000, and 140,000 Bs.-- the median incomes&#13;
of the high-, middle- and low-income groups, respectively--are used. Assuming the sample is&#13;
representative of Maturin households, the proportion of households in each group is one-sixth,&#13;
two-thirds, and one-sixth, respectively. With about 46,000 households altogether in Maturin, the&#13;
household distribution by income category is as follows: 7,400 are Low Income (median=20,000&#13;
Bs./mo), 31,200 are Middle Income (median=50,000Bs./mo), and 7,400 are High Income&#13;
(median=140,000). Using the 20,000, 50,000 and 140,000 Bs. curves in Figure 2 based on the&#13;
logit model, the probability that households with these incomes will use the improved Water and&#13;
Sanitation system at different prices can be calculated (Table 8).&#13;
Table 8: Estimated probability of improved system usage&#13;
Price (Bs. / month)&#13;
Income category    1,000    2,000   3,000   4,000    5,000    6,000   7,000&#13;
Low           0.71     0.62    0.52    0.42     0.33     0.24    0.18&#13;

For example, the probability that low-income households (median income of 20,000 Bs.) will pay&#13;
1,000 Bs. per month for the improved water and sanitation system is 71%. If the above&#13;
probabilities are multiplied by the total number of households in their respective income classes,&#13;
the result is the expected number of households that would use the improved system at each price.&#13;
For example, the expected number of households that would be willing to pay 1,000 Bs. per&#13;
month is about 39,000 (= 0.71*7,400 + 0.86*31,200 + 0.94*7,400). The table of expected&#13;
household users is as follows:&#13;

30.   If the expected number of user households from Table 13 is multiplied by a monthly price&#13;
for the service, the result represents expected revenue. However, this calculation is based on the&#13;
assumption that the monthly water bill of all households in Maturin is the same-- even those in&#13;
different income classes. In reality low-income households would have lower water bills because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 12 of 13&#13;
(1) they use less water than middle and high income households, and (2) there is a social tariff&#13;
currently in place in Maturin so that low income households pay less per unit of water than&#13;
middle- and high-income households. The calculations that follow are thus presented simply for&#13;
illustrative purposes as rough approximations.&#13;
31.   If the price were set at 1,000 Bs. per month, the expected number of low-income&#13;
households that would use the improved system is 5,300, and the amount they would pay is&#13;
5,300,000 Bs. per month or 63.6 million Bs. per year (US$374,000/year). At this price, total&#13;
revenues would equal 39.0 million Bs. per month, which is equivalent to US$ 2.76 million per&#13;
year. If this amount is divided by the total number of households in Maturin (46,000)--rather than&#13;
the predicted number of subscribing households--the resulting contribution per household in the&#13;
city is about US$ 60 per year. Similar results for all three income groups at different prices are&#13;
presented in Table 10.&#13;

The bottom three rows of Table 10 show that revenue increases as the price is increased, reaching&#13;
a maximum at a price of 5,000 Bs. per month. As the price is further increased, revenue&#13;
decreases. The important implication is thus that 5,000 Bs. is the maximum monthly price for&#13;
improved water and sanitation service that should be considered for Maturin. At prices below&#13;
5,000 Bs., revenue increases with higher prices but coverage decreases. As price is increased&#13;
beyond 5,000 Bs., however, both revenue and coverage decrease.&#13;
32.   Another significant result from Table 10 concerns households' annual expenditures for&#13;
improved water and sanitation. For example, if the price were set at 3,000 Bs. per month, the&#13;
average contribution of revenue per household in Maturin would be about US$151.  The&#13;
contribution per household served would be about US$212 per year. The pertinent planning&#13;
question is whether these amounts would be sufficient to cover debt service and operation and&#13;
maintenance costs in order to produce a financially self-sufficient and sustainable system. When&#13;
combined with engineering cost estimates, Table 9 includes the data for predicting whether a&#13;
suitable project exists for Maturin.&#13;
33.   It is also interesting to review these data in conjunction with the median income figures&#13;
reported above. The median income for the low-income category, for example, is 20,000 Bs. per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 13 of 13&#13;
month. Hence, if the monthly price for improved water supply and sanitation service were set at,&#13;
say, 1,000 Bs. per month, low-income households using the improved system would pay 5% of&#13;
their income. Corresponding percentages of income for all three income groups at alternative&#13;
prices are shown in Table 11.&#13;

For example, at a price of 3,000 Bs. per month, low-income households that used the system on&#13;
average would pay 15% of their income, middle-income households would pay 6% of their&#13;
income, and high-income users would pay only 2% of their income.&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Management Contract with a Private Operator&#13;
I.    Previous Bank involvement with the water supply and sanitation (WS&amp;S) sector in&#13;
Venezuela has been very limrited. There is nonetheless a specific experience related to the&#13;
preparation of a privatization attempt of the Caracas water system. Although this attempt&#13;
was unsuccessful, it provided useful informnation and insight for future private sector&#13;
participation initiatives in the WS&amp;S sector. The Caracas experience highlights the three&#13;
main factors that influence the delivery of efficient and effective WS&amp;S services: (i) the&#13;
need for an adequate regulatory framework that establishes clear roles and responsibilities&#13;
among sector agencies; (ii) the existence of appropriate tariff levels and billing/collection&#13;
mechanisms that can generate the funds necessary for financial autonomy and signal the&#13;
real cost of water to the consumers; and (iii) the need for an efficient and cost-conscious&#13;
management that can rationalize expenditures and plan for fluctuations in the stream of&#13;
revenues.&#13;
2.    HIDROCARIBE, the regional water company that provided WS&amp;S services in the&#13;
state of Monagas, had problems in those three areas, which led to a serious deterioration of&#13;
service quality in the state. In the context of the proposed project, authorities at the state&#13;
and municipal level in Monagas, supported by HIDROVEN, have initiated steps to&#13;
decentralize and improve the service. The state's municipalities have formed an association&#13;
(Mancomunidad), which together with the state government has created the company Aguas&#13;
de Monagas (AdM), a commercial company, that has taken over from HIDROCARIBE the&#13;
responsibility for providing WS&amp;S services in the state. AdM is now responsible for the&#13;
WS&amp;S services for the entire state of Monagas, with a staff limited to core management in&#13;
support of its board of directors and a reduced commercial department.&#13;
3.    AdM faces several key challenges related to commercial, financial and technical&#13;
efficiency in the management of the service which are critical for its sustainability and for&#13;
the achievement of the project objectives. They are: (i) urgently rehabilitating physical&#13;
infrastructure seriously deteriorated due to neglected maintenance; (ii) increasing its&#13;
revenue stream from a very modest US$1.1 million in 1994 (about US$15 per connection&#13;
per year) through better billing and collection procedures; (iii) reducing unaccounted-for-&#13;
water levels (currently at 70%); and (iv) improving the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
system, which is being inefficiently carried out by local "operators" that supply labor and&#13;
equipment under short contracts without any performance requirements.&#13;
The Management Contract&#13;
4.    In order to address these challenges, it has been agreed that AdM will contract the&#13;
management of the services with a qualified and experienced private operator. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
management contract would be a first step in the process of involving the private sector in&#13;
the delivery of the service, which is expected to result in a concession or lease contract at&#13;
the end of the project. This management contract is intended to provide AdM the&#13;
flexibility that comes with working outside the public sector, as well as the experience&#13;
and working methodology that are required to confront the important transformation&#13;
process initiated with the transfer of responsibilities from  HIDROCARIBE.  The&#13;
management contract is also intended to improve the impact of the financial support that&#13;
will be provided through the project for the rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure.&#13;
5.    The management contract constitutes a key element in the set of agreements,&#13;
contracts and obligations that have been designed to foster the institutional modernization&#13;
and improvement of water and sanitation services in the state of Monagas. Two of these&#13;
agreements are directly related to it: the Service Contract and the Contract Plan. The&#13;
service contract between the Municipalities and AdM represents the core of this&#13;
framework, delegating to AdM the obligation of the municipalities to provide water and&#13;
sanitation services, and allowing AdM to deliver this service either directly or through a&#13;
private operator. The Contract Plan defines the obligations and responsibilities of AdM&#13;
and its shareholders and establishes the operational and efficiency targets that AdM&#13;
should achieve. These arrangement are explained in more detail in Annex C.&#13;
6.    Under the design that has been adopted for the management contract, the private&#13;
operator will be directly responsible for the management of the services and the contracts&#13;
with providers, for controlling the commercial activities of AdM and for the&#13;
implementation and monitoring of the works and investments to be financed by the&#13;
World Bank project. Key tasks to be carried out by the operator include: (i) setting up&#13;
macrometering; (ii) development of the commercial and information system; (iii) public&#13;
relations with customers; and (iv) review of present contracts with local operators for the&#13;
provision of labor and equipment services for the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
systems (investments required for the installation of production macrometers, computer&#13;
hardware and software for the commercial system, and the development of a public&#13;
awareness campaign will be financed under the project). The responsibility of managing&#13;
the services also includes the obligatory achievement of the efficiency goals which will&#13;
be part of the performance targets of the Contract Plan agreed upon by AdM and its&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
7.    Consistent with its objectives, the management contract will incorporate both&#13;
economic incentives to reward the private operator for reductions in unaccounted-for-&#13;
water, achievement of cost reductions and improvement of collection above the targets&#13;
set in the Contract Plan, and financial penalties when these and other performance targets&#13;
included in the Contract Plan are not reached. However, the contract has been designed&#13;
so that the direct risk taken by the private operator is moderated by fixed monthly&#13;
payments, financed by the project as part of the regional institutional component. The&#13;
fixed payments will -be conditioned to the successful achievement of the performance&#13;
targets adopted as part of the Contract Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
8.    The performance targets included in the Contract Plan are presented in the&#13;
Appendix 1 to this annex. They have been established during project preparation through&#13;
consultation with municipal authorities, users and AdM's and HIDROVEN's technical&#13;
staff, supported by consultants with international experience in contracts involving&#13;
private operators in the management of water supply and sanitation services. The targets&#13;
were based on an evaluation of AdM's present conditions and an estimate of realistic&#13;
potential for improvement based on the experience of the consultants. The performance&#13;
targets will be reviewed after the first two years.&#13;
Contract Payment&#13;
9.    As mentioned above, the compensation system consists of two components. The&#13;
first component will be a fixed monthly payment ("retainer") which will be financed from&#13;
the World Bank loan, and will be roughly equivalent to the firm's institution building and&#13;
management consulting role. The second component will be a variable incentive&#13;
payment, contingent on improvements on the performance targets for unaccounted-for&#13;
water and collection efficiency, reflecting the entrepreneurial impact of the operator's&#13;
work. This will be financed by the revenue generated for AdM by the improvements&#13;
made, with a maximum value limited to fifty percent of the marginal benefit generated.&#13;
The incentive part of the payment system is based on the idea of short-run sharing of&#13;
benefits obtained from the independent activities of the operator. It will provide&#13;
incentives for augmented efficiency, introduce a quasi-risk-effect to the participation of&#13;
the operator, and create the possibility of additional benefits in the form of payments for&#13;
performance above pre-established targets. Both incentives and penalties will be levied&#13;
on an annual basis.&#13;
10.   Since the management contract is the first step in the process of involving the&#13;
private sector in the delivery of the services in Monagas, and that process will likely lead&#13;
to a concession/lease contract at the end of the project, two additional conditions have&#13;
been incorporated in the management contract: (i) the winner will not be excluded from&#13;
the bidding process for the concession/lease contract; and (ii) strict and transparent&#13;
conditions for reporting and accessibility by other firms to the technical and commercial&#13;
information of the operation and management of AdM have been included as part of the&#13;
Terms of Reference of this contract. Both conditions have been incorporated in order to&#13;
avoid market capture by the operator and exclude potential bidders that would be&#13;
interested in a longer term type of contract.&#13;
Bidding Process&#13;
11.   The management contract will be awarded through Competitive Bidding among a&#13;
short list of international operators of WS&amp;S services, according to the "mission&#13;
statement" of the proponent, the qualifications of the proposed staff (which will be given&#13;
significant weight in the bidding process) and the economic terms of the proposal, that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
should differentiate between the "retainer" and the "incentives" for each of the two&#13;
performance targets (unaccounted-for water and collection efficiency). It is expected that&#13;
bidders will compensate for any under or over estimation of the performance targets&#13;
through their proposed combination of a retainer and the performance incentives.&#13;
Weighting for each of the components of the bid (mission statement, team, retainer and&#13;
incentives) has been selected with the intention of indicating potential bidders that a&#13;
highly qualified management team and some risk taking is expected from the operator to&#13;
be selected.&#13;
Short-list Preparation&#13;
12.   Given the fact that the management contract has been designed to reduce the&#13;
direct risk to the operator, the potential of the bidders to achieve high levels of efficiency,&#13;
generating rapid benefits to the community and improving the economic-financial aspects&#13;
of the services has been one of the key elements considered in the preparation of the&#13;
short-list.&#13;
13.   A public call for declarations of interest was issued in order to create a short list of&#13;
bidders which could adequately address all of the aspects of the private sector&#13;
participation model proposed for AdM. From the eleven consortia that expressed their&#13;
interest in this contract-, six were selected to be included in the short-list (two British, one&#13;
American, one Spanish, one French and one German) according to three sets of criteria:&#13;
commercial capacity, technical capacity and technical quality. The main aspects of these&#13;
sets of criteria are:&#13;
(a)   Commercial Capacity.  All bidders must demonstrate the capacity to&#13;
operate a service with a business volume comparable to that of the AdM. As part of this&#13;
requirement, annual sales in potable water and sanitation services operated by the bidder&#13;
must be over US$ 20 million, and in addition, the company must exhibit a minimum&#13;
audited net worth of US$ 20 million as of December 31, 1994.&#13;
(b)   Technical Capacity. Operators that only manage potable water services&#13;
were excluded from consideration for the management contract and potential bidders&#13;
were selected among those that presented experience with the production phase, water&#13;
distribution, collection of effluents, and/or treatment plants in urban systems. Business&#13;
experience also constituted an important component of technical capacity, and to that end&#13;
a series of minimum standards representing the base levels of experience and&#13;
management capacity that was considered necessary to manage AdM were requested.&#13;
Those minimums standards are:&#13;
* minimum total population served of 900,000 inhabitants&#13;
* operation of an urban system serving at least 450,000 inhabitants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
* minimum annual sales of US$ 20 million (referred to water and sanitation&#13;
services, including all of the services in which the bidder exhibits&#13;
responsibility for overall management)&#13;
(c)   Technical Quality. The technical-operative capacity and efficiency with&#13;
which the bidders currently manage services under their control were also considered key&#13;
conditions. Three parameters were selected to measure the operational aspects of&#13;
management and define a minimum level of efficiency:&#13;
*  The minimum  collections index should exceed eighty percent, and was&#13;
defined as the percentage of total billing for the service that is actually&#13;
received by the provider;&#13;
* The maximum unaccounted-for-water index should not exceed thirty percent&#13;
of production, and was defined as the percentage of water produced that is not&#13;
billed to users; and&#13;
*  The ability to manage a unit responsible for analyzing potable water quality to&#13;
fulfill the requirements of the Venezuelan regulations on this subject.&#13;
Loan Conditionality&#13;
14.   Terms of Reference and bidding criteria have been prepared by AdM  and&#13;
Hidroven with the assistance of consultants. As a condition for negotiations, a call for&#13;
bids to the satisfaction of the World Bank was issued by AdM. The signing of the&#13;
contract will be a condition of disbursement for the second package of rehabilitatio&#13;
investments (see Annex F).&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Rehabilitation Plan for Aguas de Monagas&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The quality of water supply and sanitation (WS&amp;S) services in Venezuela, and&#13;
particularly in Monagas, is poor, even though more than eighty percent of urban population&#13;
has piped water supply and slightly more than sixty percent has sewerage. Water supply is&#13;
characterized by widespread rationing, low pressures, questionable water quality, extremely&#13;
high unaccounted-for-water (up to 70% according to some estimates) and inadequate&#13;
customer service. Waste waters are not treated and raw sewage is discharged into the&#13;
receiving waters, polluting surface and groundwater sources.  Despite heavy capital&#13;
investment in infrastructure, the system has largely failed to provide reliable and efficient&#13;
service.  In general, the financial performance of the sector operating company&#13;
(HIDROCARIBE) has been dismal and the quality of service has deteriorated continuously.&#13;
Physical losses are very high, billing often does not cover more than a third of the consumers&#13;
and collection typically is less than half of the billing. In order to improve these inadequacies&#13;
of the water supply and sanitation system a rehabilitation plan has been designed.&#13;
Plan Objectives&#13;
2.    In light of these water supply and sanitation problems, the two main objectives&#13;
contemplated in the Rehabilitation Plan for Aguas de Monagas are: (i) resolving the&#13;
problems associated with water services quality; and (ii) increasing the reliability of the&#13;
service.  An additional complementary objective to be achieved is improving the&#13;
customer's satisfaction and incentives for payment by avoiding disruptions in service, an&#13;
event frequently used by users as an excuse for non-payment.&#13;
Rehabilitation Investments. Selection of Priorities&#13;
3.    A Rehabilitation Plan has been designed to achieve these goals. The selection of the&#13;
works has been done according to the following order of prioritiesi:&#13;
(a) improve water quality;&#13;
(b) provide sufficient water storage capacity for a reliable service provision,&#13;
_ _ (c) improve distribution networks and&#13;
(d) improve sewerage networks and existing wastewater treatment infrastructure.&#13;
'These priorities were not followed only in a few cases where inmmediate attention to wastewater&#13;
was necessary for health and aesthetic reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
4.    The works selected to be financed under this project in conformity with these&#13;
priorities are itemized in the tables to this annex, and grouped into three rehabilitation&#13;
packages that can be independently completed in their entirety, consisting of: a) emergency&#13;
investments; b) an initial package of investments for the first two years; and c) investments&#13;
for the final two years of the project, which will be conditioned on the achievement of&#13;
contract-plan targets and in particular the agreed financial rate of return and capital&#13;
availability. Main characteristics of these three rehabilitation packages and total&#13;
investments costs to be financed under this project are summarized in the table I below:&#13;
(a) The first rehabilitation package will finance emergency investments required&#13;
to avoid the physical collapse of the urban water supply systems, correct the&#13;
principal water losses and water quality problem and help lessen acute water&#13;
shortages next summer season.  They will also concentrated in the&#13;
improvement and rehabilitation of the pumping system, in the interconnection&#13;
of the networks and in the provision of basic and reliable disinfection. These&#13;
investments will be carried out before project effectiveness and will be&#13;
eligible for retroactive financing.   Engineering designs and bidding&#13;
documents for these investments have been prepared with the help of a grant&#13;
from the Austrian government and funds provided by the state government&#13;
and are expected to be ready before negotiations (see table 2).&#13;
(b)  The second rehabilitation package will finance priority rehabilitation&#13;
investments in the urban area, mainly focused on the reduction of&#13;
unaccounted-for-water and the improvement of the system efficiency, that are&#13;
expected to have a great incidence in customer's satisfaction and in the&#13;
reliability of the service. This second sub-component is expected to be&#13;
completed within the first two years of project execution, before the mid-term&#13;
review (see table 3).&#13;
(c)  The third rehabilitation package will finance the improvement of service&#13;
quality in the urban areas and some expansion of coverage in marginal areas.&#13;
It will include the rehabilitation and improvement of potable water production&#13;
infrastructure, the rehabilitation and expansion of water distribution and&#13;
sewerage networks and the rehabilitation and improvement of wastewater&#13;
management infrastructure. This third sub-component is expected to be&#13;
carried out in the last two years of the project. Its execution will be dependent&#13;
on the achievement of the physical, financial and efficiency targets&#13;
established for mid-term review (see table 4).&#13;

Additional Considerations&#13;
5.    Together with the priorities presented above, two main problems that affect&#13;
Maturin, the largest consumption center, have been taken into account for the selection of&#13;
the investments to be included in the rehabilitation plan: (i) the present supply relays&#13;
heavily on the Amana-Maturin system, a complex infrastructure, largely overdimensioned,&#13;
that takes water from the Amana river more than 100 km from Maturin and transports it&#13;
after treatment through a gravely corroded steel pipe; and (ii) the lack of reliability in the&#13;
service is the main cause of customers dissatisfaction and one of the main incentives for&#13;
non-payment, apart from having an important impact on water quality.&#13;
6.    Which water sources should be used to supply Maturin?   As part of the&#13;
analysis made of the supply options for Maturin during project preparation, it has been&#13;
determined that the current system that relays heavily on the Amana-Maturin system&#13;
should be progressively abandoned in order to reduce dependence on the flow from the&#13;
Amana River, which has been greatly reduced in recent years and is subjected to increasing&#13;
competing demands (it hardly reaches 600 lls in the summer dry season, while the nominal&#13;
capacity of the Amana system is 4 m3/s). The proposed solution is based on the following&#13;
criteria:&#13;
(a)   The Amana system will be repaired only and where it is strictly necessary to&#13;
ensure the continuation of the supply in the short term. Latter, it will be&#13;
maintained as is necessary for supplying the town located along the Amana-&#13;
Maturin pipe.&#13;
(b)   Water drawn from two points on the Guarapiche River will become the&#13;
principal source used for the supply of Maturin. The first proposed intake is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
at the present abstraction point in the Lower Guarapiche, which will be&#13;
improved and expanded to produce 1,200 I/sec. The second proposed intake&#13;
is located upstream, near Cerro Colorado and as close as possible to the&#13;
Alto Guri tank, so that both intakes could be connected to the Alto Guri&#13;
tank, which currently receives water from the Amana treatment plant.&#13;
Thanks to the additional supply provided by the two intakes on the&#13;
Guarapiche, the dependence on the Amana River will be diminished and&#13;
eventually eliminated and the present Amana pipeline will be used only to&#13;
supply towns upstream from Maturin. The result of this plan will be a&#13;
system based- in the State of Monagas with principal installations close to&#13;
the capital. Operation will be facilitated and personnel demands for housing&#13;
and convenient access to work will be easily satisfied.&#13;
(c)   The alternative of a second diversion from the Amana River has been&#13;
considered and deemed inadvisable. Technical studies concluded that both&#13;
diversions in the Guarapiche River are recommended because the river&#13;
waters are regulated and the installations are located nearer to Maturin, the&#13;
principal consumption area. Any possible advantage of diversifying the&#13;
sources (Guarapiche and Amana instead of two sources from the&#13;
Guarapiche) is limited by the fact that the catchment areas of the two rivers&#13;
are similar and near one another. Therefore, when negative conditions&#13;
(drought, high turbidity) exist in one, the same will hold true in the other&#13;
and the benefits associated with diversification become less significant.&#13;
7.    How to get better reliability for the system?  Adequate reliability  on the&#13;
distribution network requires a greater water storage capacity and the possibility to transfer&#13;
water among the different sectors and water supply sources. The Alto Guri tank (30,000&#13;
in3) represents the only significant reserve storage capacity of the supply system at the&#13;
present time and a minimum of another 30,000 m3 is suggested for the system. Under these&#13;
conditions, a new tank located near the Rojo Tank is recommended (La Manga Tank).&#13;
Distribution would so come from two sources: (i) the Alto Guri tank, which connects to the&#13;
Cerro Colorado treatment plant (as well as the Amana pipeline in the short and medium&#13;
term); and (ii) the La Manga tank, which connects to the Lower Guarapiche treatment&#13;
plant. With this additional tank, the distribution acquires a very favorable symmetry,&#13;
which in the future could be complemented by two additional underground reserve tanks of&#13;
30,000 mi3 each.&#13;
8.    The optimal operation of the system also requires a connection between the two,&#13;
now partially independent, distribution sectors of Maturin, to allow sufficient water&#13;
transfers when one of the sources experiences adverse supply conditions. Even without the&#13;
La Manga tank at ground level, the Lower Guarapiche treatment plant should be able to&#13;
pump into the Rojo tank instead of pumping directly to the network. This connection is&#13;
also necessary since it will be necessary to transfer water from Lower Guarapiche to Alto&#13;
Guri, because of the expected short-term deficiencies in the Amana supply, so that the&#13;
burden of water shortages could be shared across the entire population in the most sensible&#13;
way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;

9.    Due to these conditions, the rehabilitation of the Rojo tank and the main pipeline&#13;
from the Rojo tank to the Alto Guri tank has been included as part of the maximum priority&#13;
emergency works, substituting the existing small-diameter pipeline and inadequate&#13;
reinforcement with the proposed connection pipe between these two tanks.&#13;

WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Rural Rehabilitation and Participatory Management Program&#13;
(Programa Participativo de Mejoramiento de Acueductos Rurales - PROPAMAR)&#13;
Background'&#13;
1.    Unlike many other countries in the region, Venezuela has high rates of coverage for&#13;
WS&amp;S services in rural areas. However, the quality of services is poor. It is estimated that 80%&#13;
of the rural population has piped water supply through individual house connections and 40% is&#13;
connected to a sewerage system. In the state of Monagas, rural water supply coverage is also&#13;
high. Sewerage service is uncommon, however, in Monagas' low population density rural areas,&#13;
and the majority of residents rely on pit-latrines and septic tank systems for the disposal of&#13;
household wastes. Rural water supply systems in the state of Monagas usually consist of a well, a&#13;
storage tank and a small distribution system.  They are subject to intermittent service with&#13;
prolonged periods of interruption. Moreover, most systems do not treat water for potability and&#13;
water quality varies widely among rural communities, leading to adverse health impacts in some&#13;
cases. These conditions stem from several critical problems: i) inadequate supervision of well&#13;
operators, due to the isolation of rural systems from the central management unit in Maturin; ii)&#13;
little or no water treatment or water quality monitoring; iii) poorly designed wells and/or water&#13;
systems; iv) insufficient water supplies; and vii) insufficient finding and lack of timely payment&#13;
for repairs and maintenance.&#13;
2.    All of these problems are rooted in highly centralized and deficitary public management&#13;
systems with few, if any, built-in incentives for delivering a reliable and efficient service and no&#13;
attempt at cost-recovery.  Rural water and sanitation systems are the responsibility of&#13;
municipalities. Historically, however, municipalities have not had the budget resources or the&#13;
institutional capacity to assume this responsibility. To fill the void, the Ministry of Sanitation first&#13;
and the state government later have provided informal yet systematic technical and financial&#13;
support to rural water systems in recent years. Today, ninety percent of the 206 rural water&#13;
systems in the state of Monagas are managed by the State Public Works Department (Obras&#13;
Publicas del Estado - OPE), and the remaining ten percent are under the responsibility of&#13;
HIDROCARIBE, the regional water company. The OPE systems are generally small, each&#13;
covering about 100 households. They are usually run by individually contracted operators who&#13;
are poorly trained and have disincentives to travel to the capital to report on problems, since they&#13;
must pay travel costs out of their own salary.  HIDROCARIBE - Monagas contracts out the&#13;
operation of the rural systems to five operating companies, each covering a separate region of the&#13;
This background section is based on a report on institutional arrangements for water supply and sanitation in&#13;
rural and peri-urban areas in the state of Monagas Monagas, prepared by Gabrielle Watson, from Vanasse&#13;
Hangen Brustlin, Inc. (VHB), in February 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

state (about 800 households on average each). In many cases, paradoxically, the state's poor&#13;
performance has led municipalities to re-assume some of their initial service responsibility and&#13;
give ad-hoc support by providing emergency water supply or funding to conduct repairs.&#13;
3.    The sustainability of rural water systems is all the more precarious that in the present&#13;
organizational framework, communities are virtually not involved in the operation and&#13;
maintenance of water and sanitation services.  Although communities participated in water&#13;
services management in the 1960s, generous Government subsidy programs beginning in the&#13;
1970s for basic services such as housing, health, water, sanitation and even electric power have&#13;
encouraged communities to take a more passive role in defining and meeting their service needs.&#13;
Recent government budget cuts and the resulting deterioration of basic services has increased&#13;
communities' dissatisfaction with service levels while raising their awareness of government&#13;
funding limits. Moreover, discussions with rural community representatives have indicated that&#13;
communities would be interested in a scheme involving them more in the management of their&#13;
WS&amp;S services. A relatively high level of organization at the community level provides a&#13;
favorable basis for a community based service management scheme: communities in rural areas&#13;
are currently organized in functional groupings such as neighborhood associations (juntas de&#13;
vecino.s), farmer associations (sindicatos agrarios), and women's groups (amas de casa). In&#13;
addition, since 1989, groups of communities are represented by Parish Committees (juntas&#13;
parroquiales), which are elected in parallel with the municipal government2. In order to develop&#13;
a community-based management system for rural water supply, the proposed loan will include a&#13;
rural subcomponent which will support the Rural Rehabilitation and Participatory Management&#13;
Program (Programa Participativo de Mejoramiento de Acueductos Rurales - PROPAMAR) to&#13;
assist in the rehabilitation of rural water supply infrastructure, and to pilot decentralized and&#13;
participatory management of rural water systems in the state of Monagas.&#13;
Objectives and Strategy&#13;
4.    Objectives. The objectives of the rural subcomponent are to i) improve the quality of&#13;
water supply service in rural areas; ii) improve the sustainability of rural water systems through&#13;
better operation and maintenance and cost-recovery practices by the communities themselves; and&#13;
iii) pilot a new participatory management model that could be replicated in the rest of the country.&#13;
5.    Strategy.  Growing fiscal demands on the central and regional governments have&#13;
prompted a search for alternatives to the heavily subsidized and centralized water supply and&#13;
sanitation management scheme for rural areas in Venezuela. In the state of Monagas, state and&#13;
municipal authorities have decided to test a new participatory approach to increase the rural&#13;
population's access to good quality water services through community-generated and managed&#13;
water supply projects, with support form the central Government. The proposed approach also&#13;
2 The Venezuelan Organic Law for Municipal Administration states that "Parishes will be auxiliary entities of the&#13;
municipal government and of local participation, through which residents will collaborate in the management&#13;
of community matters" (Chapter V, Article 34). To date, Monagas Parish Committees have acted primarily as&#13;
conduits of demands from rural and peri-urban communities, though carrying out projects or monitoring&#13;
senrice conditions are clearly functions within their constitutional scope.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 3 of 15&#13;
seeks to control investment and maintenance expenditures through improved cost-recovery, and&#13;
increase the efficiency of investment.&#13;
6.    The strategy of the state and municipal authorities relies on the following key principles:&#13;
*  the government will provide low per capita investment grants to ensure a basic level of&#13;
service for all rural residents; the basic level of service is defined as potable water&#13;
supply through individual house connections that will meet the daily human&#13;
consumption need, set at 150 liters/capita/day by the Venezuelan authorities using&#13;
guidelines from the World Health Organization.&#13;
*  communities will finance the cost difference between a higher level of service they may&#13;
choose and the basic level of service;&#13;
* investment decisions will be based on community demand;&#13;
* communities will take over the management of water service operations and&#13;
maintenance, and the responsibility for cost-recovery.&#13;
7.     Preparation Work3. During project preparation, the following studies were carried out&#13;
with support from the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development Grant: i) an analysis&#13;
of the institutional framework and the distribution of responsibilities for rural water supply4; ii) a&#13;
diagnosis of the current infrastructure and rehabilitation needs, including detailed cost estimates5;&#13;
and iii) a survey of approximately 800 rural households to assess rural residents' willingness to&#13;
pay and willingness to participate in the management of rural water supply services6. In addition,&#13;
the project preparation team held consultative meetings with leaders of several rural communities&#13;
and mayors of municipalities to discuss current problems and the communities' interest in taking&#13;
over the operation of and cost-recovery for their WS&amp;S systems. Results from the willingness-&#13;
to-pay study indicate that rural residents are primarily concerned with water quality and its impact&#13;
on health. The study predicts that 60% of respondents would be willing to pay Bs 2,000&#13;
(US$11.77) per month and over 50% would pay 3,000 (US$17.6) per month for improved service&#13;
providing safely potable water. These results are significant given that rural users are currently&#13;
not billed at all for their water service.  Moreover, 56%  of respondents believe that their&#13;
community would want to run its own water system, 77% of respondents were somewhat or very&#13;
interested in serving in a water committee, and 58% thought that the community would do a&#13;
better job than government in managing the water system. A summary of the results of the study&#13;
is presented in Appendix 1.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

8.    The subcomponent, also called PROPAMAR, would finance investment and technical&#13;
assistance for the improvement of water supply service and management capacity at the&#13;
community level. The investments will include civil works, equipment, goods and materials for&#13;
the rehabilitation, improvement and some expansion of water systems in rural areas to provide a&#13;
basic level of service which is defined as: (i) a service connection for every household; (ii) water&#13;
supply service to ensure the availability of 150 liters per capita per day, and (iii) supply of potable&#13;
water (i.e., disinfected). Rural WS&amp;S systems in approximately 85 communities covering about&#13;
45,000 rural inhabitants (about 50 % of the state's rural population) are expected to be financed&#13;
over four years under this subcomponent. Two subsidy ceilings would be set: the first, amounting&#13;
to approximately $56 per capita, would apply to about 90% of communities, which have a water&#13;
system that needs to be improved; the second, amounting to approximately $180 per capita,&#13;
would apply to about 10% of communities where no water supply infrastructure currently exists.&#13;
A detailed estimate of investment needs is presented in Appendix 2.&#13;
9.    The technical assistance will finance the coordination and administration of PROPAMAR&#13;
by AdM, and it will enable AdM to assist communities in organizing, designing and executing&#13;
investments, and building management capacity. Specifically, the subcomponent would finance&#13;
the services of a non-governmental organization (NGO)8 to assist communities in: (i) setting up a&#13;
water committee; (ii) examining technical options to meet different service levels, and the cost-&#13;
sharing implications of investment and operation and maintenance for these options; (iii)&#13;
organizing and managing their water systems, (iv) preparing a financing plan and financial&#13;
management scheme for proposed investments and subsequent 0 &amp; M of the system; and (v)&#13;
raising awareness on water resource issues. The NGO would also carry out: (i) training through&#13;
workshops on management and accounting and cost recovery for water committee&#13;
representatives; (ii) a certification program for water system operators; and (iii) an information,&#13;
dissemination and awareness campaign using local media sources (radio, newspapers) as well as&#13;
existing community fora to promote the Government's strategy for managing rural water systems&#13;
and the proposed program; and (iv) capacity building for municipalities to take over technical&#13;
assistance to communities once the NGO withdraws.&#13;
Cost and Implementation Plan&#13;
10.   Costs. The total direct cost of the subcomponent is estimated at US$3.85 million as&#13;
shown in Table I below. The total cost is estimated at US$4.7 when taking into account&#13;
contingency costs (US$.52 million for investments and US$09 million for technical assistance)&#13;
and taxes (US$.24 million for equipment purchases). Costs for works and equipment are based on&#13;
an average per capita investment of about US$70 ($12,000 Bolivares) for a variety of technology&#13;
options resulting from the rural infrastructure diagnostic study prepared as part of project&#13;
preparation. The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance activities is based on the&#13;
scope of work indicated in the activity's terms of reference and on consultant and management&#13;
fees for similar work carried out in Venezuela.&#13;
8 This includes the possibility of contracting the services of a consulting firm, since the contract will be awarded&#13;
through a competitive bidding process. All further references to "the NGO" in this document should be&#13;
understood to include a consulting firm as well.&#13;

11.   Financing and Flow of Funds. The subcomponent's financing plan is presented in Table&#13;
2 below. Funds would be channelled through a trust fund to be managed by Aguas de Monagas.&#13;
The Central Government would finance 50 percent of eligible investments (works, equipment,&#13;
goods and materials) and 100 percent of the technical assistance costs, including trust fund&#13;
administration, for a total of US$2.35 million, which would be provided on a grant basis to the&#13;
trust fund and which would be eligible for reimbursement from the Bank loan9. The State&#13;
Government would contribute 35% of the investment costs, estimated at US$1.05 million.&#13;
Participating municipalities and communities will finance the remaining 15% in the form of cash,&#13;
labor and/or materials, for a value of US$0.45 million The trust fund would be created with an&#13;
initial capitalization equivalent to four months of expected investments for 1996 to be provided&#13;
from the State Government's 1996 contribution.  Creation of the trust fund and its initial&#13;
capitalization would be completed by March 31, 1996.&#13;
12.   A subsidiary grant agreement will be signed between the Ministry of Environment and&#13;
Aguas de Monagas, for the transfer of US$2.35 million into the trust fund over four years, to&#13;
cover the central government's portion of the program. State funds will be allocated into the trust&#13;
fund from the state budget for rural water systems, on a bi-annual basis. Municipal funds will be&#13;
allocated into the trust fund on a project by project basis, in coordination with the community's&#13;
presentation of its proposed investment project and cost-sharing plan (see Community Water&#13;
Action Plan, COWAP, para. 24). All contributions will be regulated through the Trust Fund&#13;
Agreement.&#13;

13.   Institutional arrangements. PROPAMAR will be implemented over a four-year period.&#13;
In the first year, a small number of communities will be targeted for program promotion on the&#13;
basis of the demand analysis yielded by the willingness-to-pay study for the rural areas, and of the&#13;
interest in the program expressed by the corresponding communities and mayors. In the following&#13;
three years, continued demand assessment and outreach to communities will enable communities&#13;
and mayors to come forward and express their intention to participate in the program.&#13;
14.   AdM will be the executing agency for PROPAMAR. To channel investment and technical&#13;
assistance financing, AdM will create a trust fund and act as its trustee. AdM will contract a trust&#13;
fund coordinator and necessary support staff to supervise the program on a full time basis. The&#13;
World Bank will approve the operating procedures of the trust fund.&#13;
15.   To manage the day-to-day operation of the program and provide technical assistance to&#13;
communities, a well-qualified Non Governmental Organization (NGO) or consultant will be hired&#13;
under Bank financing. The contract will be for a period of 2 years. At the end of two years it will&#13;
be either extended or terminated, according to the NGO's performance to be evaluated by AdM&#13;
after 18 months. In the case where the contract is terminated, another NGO would be contracted&#13;
for the remaining two years of the project. The Venezuelan authorities have prepared terms of&#13;
reference for the NGO's work that are satisfactory to the World Bank. They have also presented&#13;
to the Bank a draft Operating Manual - as a condition of negotiations - which must be revised and&#13;
completed as a condition of disbursements. Other conditions of disbursement for this&#13;
subcomponent include the signing of a contract with an NGO for the execution of PROPAMAR.&#13;
and the initial capitalization of the Trust Fund.&#13;
16.   Implementation Responsibilities. AdM will be responsible for:&#13;
*  Supervising the work of the NGO, and preparing quarterly reports on the program's&#13;
performance for the Board of Directors in AdM;&#13;
*  Approving Community Water Action Plans (COWAPS) at the level of the Board of&#13;
Directors, on the recommendation of the NGO,&#13;
*  Aministering procurement and disbursements from the trust fund.&#13;
17.   The NGO will be responsible for:&#13;
* Preparing and executing the information campaign to promote PROPAMAR and&#13;
explain eligibility and participation rules;&#13;
* Identifying communities and municipalities that are willing to participate in the&#13;
program;&#13;

population and number of communities) to assist in technical assistance to&#13;
communities during program implementation, and to take over technical assistance&#13;
activities after project ends and NGO or Consultant withdraws at the end of the four&#13;
years.&#13;
18.   The Communities, with assistance from the NGO and the municipality will be responsible&#13;
for:&#13;
* forming a water comittee;&#13;
* preparing the COWAP and arranging for the community cost-sharing of at least 5% of&#13;
the investment costs, in the form of cash, labor or materials;&#13;

* Transfering funds into the trust fund to cover 50% of the rural program investments&#13;
and 100% of expenses for technical assistance activities for PROPAMAR; these funds&#13;
would be eligible for reimbursement from the Bank loan.&#13;
Summary of Steps in Implementation for PROPAMAR Sub-projects&#13;
Eight steps will be followed for the implementation of a community water project under the proposed program:&#13;
1. The NGO promotes the program and raises awareness on water issues through direct media, thtough&#13;
mayors and juntas parroquiales in the municipalities, and through community leaders. Duration: I month.&#13;
2. The interested community forms a water committee, either as a new association or within an existing&#13;
community organization structure. The water cormmittee receives assistance from the NGO to promote the&#13;
program wNithin the community. Duration: 1.5 months.&#13;
3. The water committee, with assistance from the NGO, collects a commitment fee (500 Bs., equivalent to&#13;
US$3) from each household, to be used as part of the community's contribution to investment costs. The fee&#13;
ensures commitment and motivation from the community to pursue the program. The water committee&#13;
deposits the commitment funds directly into the rural program trust fund. Duration: I month.&#13;
4. Once the commitment fee is secured in the trust fund, the NGO formally begins technical assistance to:&#13;
the water committee to: i) strengthen its planning and management capacity; and ii) prepare the COWAP.&#13;
Duration: 3 months.&#13;
5. The Water Committee presents its COWAP for the NGO's clearance and recommendation for approval&#13;
to AdM. Along with the COWAP, the community presents the remainder of its contribution to investMent&#13;
costs (cash, tools. and/or letter of commitment from water committee to mobilize a certain quantity of&#13;
community labor). For the COWAP to be formally considered, the municipality must deposit its share of&#13;
investment costs into the trust fimd. Duration: 0.5 month.&#13;
6. If necessary, the COWAP is modified or improved to reach complete compliance with program conditions..&#13;
Once AdM approves the COWAP, it can begin the contracting of works. The community water comrnmittee&#13;
gives the no-objection for the signing of contracts. Duration: 1.5 months.&#13;
7. The water committee is actively involved in the execution and supervision of works. Throughout, it is&#13;
receiving T.A. to take over the management and operation of the water system. Duration: 3 months.&#13;
8. The water committee begins managing its water system, and it receives continued T.A. from the NGO&#13;
and the municipality. An evaluation of the community water project is carried out after 6 months, to assess: i)&#13;
the effectiveness of the rehabilitation works; and ii) the functioning of the water committee as provider of&#13;
service.&#13;
Throughout steps I to 7, municipalities are building up capacity to take over the NGO's T.A. role once the NGO]&gt;&#13;
withdraws, at the end of its contract.&#13;

22.   Eligibility criteria.  Communities will learn about the program, its conditions and&#13;
eligibility criteria through outreach and promotion activities coordinated by the NGO. Once a&#13;
community decides to participate, its newly formed water committee, with support from the&#13;
NGO, will collect a flat commitment fee from community households, for a total amount&#13;
equivalent to 500 Bs. (approximately US$3) per household for at least 80% of the households in&#13;
that community. The commitment funds collected will be deposited directly into the trust fund, to&#13;
indicate the community's willingness to participate in the program and receive technical assistance&#13;
in the preparation of a COWAP. The funds will be used as part of the community's contribution&#13;
towards investment cost-sharing.&#13;
23.   To be eligible for investment funding through the program, communities should fulfill the&#13;
following criteria:&#13;
i) The community will have formed a water committee to manage a) the preparation of&#13;
the Community Water Action Plan (COWAP), the contents of which are detailed below&#13;
and b) the water system itself, once improved, including cost-recovery activities,&#13;
ii) The water comittee should agree to cover all routine operations and maintenance costs&#13;
for the system, once it is improved;&#13;
iii) The water committee will have prepared a COWAP; in order to ensure complete&#13;
community commitment, the COWAP will be signed by at least 80 % of households&#13;
before it is acceptable for submission to the selection committee.&#13;
24.   Content of Community Water Action Plan (COWAP). The COWAPs will detail:&#13;
a) the nature and cost of investments planned, including engineeering designs and the&#13;
anticipated improvements yielded by those investments;&#13;
b) the amount raised by the municipality and the community for 15% investment cost-&#13;
sharing; in addition, the amount raised by the community for investment above the subsidy&#13;
level, if any.&#13;
c) the planned scheme for operation and maintenance of the system, whether by the&#13;
community itself (through a community-selected operator), or through a hired contractor,&#13;
d) the planned financial plan and management scheme to cover routine operation and&#13;
maintenance costs and an increasing part of major maintenance and future capital costs.&#13;
This would include the proposed mechanism for tariff collection at the community level;&#13;
e) the community association that will hold responsibility for WS&amp;S management&#13;
activities. This section will describe: i) how and when the association was established; ii)&#13;
its composition (number and gender of members, division of responsibilities); and iii) what&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 10 of 15&#13;
its training needs are, if any; the existence of a body to manage the sub-project at the&#13;
community level will be a condition for funding.&#13;
Participating communities will receive technical assistance from the NGO or Consultant in&#13;
coordination with AdM and the municipalities (through the juntas parroquiales and the appointed&#13;
staff member) to improve their management and decision-making capacity and to prepare&#13;
COWAPs, including the technical/design work.&#13;
25.   COWAP Selection and approval. The NGO/Consultant will evaluate the COWAPs on&#13;
a first-come, first-served basis and make recommendations for approval or modification to AdM,&#13;
which, with involved municipalities, will select a number of proposals corresponding to the funds&#13;
available for that year. Complete procedures will be detailed in the operational manual for the&#13;
program.&#13;
The approval of proposals will be made on the basis of the following criteria:&#13;
- technical soundness, cost-feasibility and cost-effectiveness of proposed works and&#13;
improvements;&#13;
- evidence of compliance with the financial conditions described above, i.e. i) deposit of&#13;
community commitment fee in the trust fund account to allow the onset of technical&#13;
assistance activities; and ii) deposit of community and municipality cost-sharing funds&#13;
(1 5% of total basic investment cost plus amount above basic investment cost) in the trust&#13;
fund account;&#13;
26.   In principle, once the community has reached the COWAP presentation stage, its chances&#13;
of receiving funding will be high. Adjustments and revisions of the COWAP may be necessary,&#13;
and will be carried out with assistance from the NGO or Consultant. The Bank would review the&#13;
first five COWAPs before final approval, and subsequent reviews would be done on an ex-post&#13;
basis.&#13;
27.   Technical Assistance to Communities during and after COWAP Implementation.&#13;
During construction the community, through its water committee, and the NGO with the&#13;
municipality will supervise the works.  The water committee will also set up the financial&#13;
management scheme and tariff collection mechanism to be implemented once the improved system&#13;
is functioning. It will select an operator (or may keep the one already in place, if his/her service&#13;
has been satisfactory) to operate the system, on a competitive basis. The operator will undergo a&#13;
short training and certification program organized by the NGO or Consultant and AdM for all&#13;
new and continuing water system operators in the communities involved in the program. After&#13;
the works are completed, the community will be fully responsible for implementing its water&#13;
systems management scheme, including cost-recovery activities.&#13;
28.   Support to the communities would include a yearly inspection of the infrastructure, a&#13;
review of the tariffs charged in the community and of management practices, and assistance in&#13;
large maintenance works. In the first year after works are completed the NGO/Consultant would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 11 of 15&#13;
provide this yearly technical consultancy at a nominal fee, which will be defined in the operational&#13;
manual to be presented to the bank as a condition of effectiveness.  It will also train the&#13;
municipality to take over this task thereafter. The municipality would continue to charge a&#13;
nominal fee for the yearly consultancy to cover part of its costs.&#13;
Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
29.   Procurement will follow Bank procedures. It is anticipated that contracts for works and&#13;
goods will be below US$250,000 and US$50,000, respectively, allowing for local shopping&#13;
procedures with at least three quotes. AdM will be responsible for procurement and will operate&#13;
in consultation with the water committees, who will give their no-objection to the signing of&#13;
contracts and who will instruct AdM to make payments when works/tasks are completed to the&#13;
water committees' satisfaction. Where possible and convenient, purchases may be grouped to&#13;
allow for local competitive bidding. The Bank will disburse loan funds upon review of all&#13;
procurement documentation for community investment projects, presented in groupings to&#13;
diminish transaction costs. Bank review of procurement documentation will be done ex-ante for&#13;
the first ten community projects, and ex-post thereafter.&#13;

Project Supervision and Reporting&#13;
30.   Monitoring and Performance Evaluation.   Active monitoring and supervision,&#13;
especially during the first year, will enable AdM to make the adjustments necessary for improved&#13;
implementation performance in subsequent years. This strategy will help ensure the sustainability&#13;
of investments in rural WS&amp;S infrastructure over the long term. Monitoring Indicators for the&#13;
program will allow the supervision team to follow the progress and speed of implementation.&#13;
Performance will be evaluated separately to judge whether the program is achieving its intended&#13;
results. Monitoring Indicators are described in the following table:&#13;

3 1.   The performance of the program will additionally be measured through annual audits of&#13;
the improved water systems to evaluate water quality, reliability, financial viability of self-run&#13;
community systems. To measure the success of PROPAMAR, particular attention will be paid to&#13;
i) whether the improved water systems supply potable water at the set objective of 150&#13;
liters/capita/day, ii) whether and how many beneficiary communities are meeting their cost-&#13;
recovery responsibilities and cash-flow  requirements;  iii) whether the level of per capita&#13;
investment has been maintained under the established ceilings.   These audits would be carried&#13;
out by an independent NGO or consultant hired by AdM under the T.A. component of&#13;
PROPAMAR. In addition, a small household survey would be carried out at mid-term review and&#13;
at the end of the project, to measure the beneficiaries' satisfaction with their level of service.&#13;
32.   Reporting. The program coordinator in AdM, in consultation with the executing NGO,&#13;
will prepare semi-annual progress reports on PROPAMAR and the status of implementation,&#13;
based on the monitoring indicators described above. This report is to be sent to the Bank by&#13;
September 30th for the semester ending June 3 0th, and by March 3 1st for the semester ending&#13;
December 3 1 rst of each year. The March report will include the yearly performance results&#13;
stemming from the performance audit. The report will detail the problems as well as the&#13;
achievements of the program to allow for a constructive learning process and program&#13;
adjustment, if necessary. The report will be submitted to the Bank for review, comment, and&#13;
action, if needed, to improve the program's implementation mechanisms. In addition, a special&#13;
report on this subcomponent will be prepared for the mid-term review of the project.&#13;
33.   Financial Audits. During project preparation, the accounts to be set up and auditing&#13;
procedures (scope, terms of reference) were agreed with AdM. Aguas de Monagas will maintain&#13;
separate accounts for all program expenditures involving the use of Bank loan proceeds. These&#13;
accounts, as well as the trust fund account for PROPAMAR, will be audited annually by external&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audits will be carried out in conjunction with&#13;
the annual financial audit for the overall project, procedures for which are detailed in the main text&#13;
of the Staff Appraisal Report. All audit costs will be financed by AdM.&#13;

Appendix 1&#13;
Summary of Preliminary Results of the&#13;
Willingness-to-Pay study in&#13;
Rural Areas of the State of Monagas&#13;
1. In July 1995, a willingness-to-pay survey was carried out in a sample of 15 rural communities in the State&#13;
of Monagas, covering approximately 900 households in three zones of economic activity: the cattle region, the&#13;
petroleum region, and the farning region. Focus group meetings were held with ten to twenty residents each,&#13;
to obtain preliminary information on current water supply conditions, satisfaction with the service, willingness&#13;
to pay for improvements in the service, and interest of users in running their own community water system.&#13;
This allowed for a first draft of the questionnaire to be prepared and subsequently tested in a pilot survey. The&#13;
final questionnaire included six different versions, corresponding to two different scenarios for water&#13;
improvement and three different average monthly prices per household for each scenario. The first scenario&#13;
(Option 1) proposed an improvement of water quantity to guarantee at least 12 hours of water each day.&#13;
Prices for this option were Bs 500, Bs 1,000, and Bs 2,000. The second scenario was presented as more&#13;
expensive than Option I and proposed an improvement of water quantity and quality to guarantee safely&#13;
potable water for 24 hours per day. Prices for this option were Bs 1,000, Bs 2,000 and Bs 4,000.&#13;
2. The survey showed that water supply is by far the highest priority for the sample households compared to&#13;
other community problems listed (education, streets, etc.). Only 16% of respondents receive water 24 hours&#13;
per day in the summer and 31% in the winter, yet the quality of water and its impact on health was of more&#13;
concern than its available quantity, which was deemed reasonably satisfactory. Ncvertheless, the majority of&#13;
respondents drink water directly from the tap (73% in the summer and 67% in the winter). The rest boil it,&#13;
filter it, or "purify" it by settling the turbidity in a storage container. Household incomes were low overall,&#13;
with 25% at a median of Bs 16,000/month, 50% at a median Bs 32,000/month, and 25% at a median of Bs&#13;
70,000/month. This explains why only 9% of the respondents buy bottled water, with an average monthly&#13;
expenditure of Bs 1,600 in the summer and Bs 1,400 in the winter.&#13;
3. The study concluded that willingness to pay in rural areas of the state of Monagas is quite high, with 80%&#13;
of the respondents willing to use the system with Option 2 improvements at an average monthly price of Bs&#13;
2,000 (US$ 140 per year). Seventy-five percent of respondents would pay Bs 3,000 per month (US$ 210 per&#13;
year). These amounts are of the same magnitude as those charged for well-run systems in industrialized&#13;
countries. Almost two-thirds of respondents chose Option 2 over Option I and over 80% of those respondents&#13;
said they would use it and pay the corresponding average monthly fee. Demand for improvement was lowest&#13;
in the agricultural zone. The econometric analysis showed that major determinants of willingness to pay for&#13;
Option I were income, education, the cost to users of Option 2, satisfaction with existing water supply service,&#13;
and the desire for operating the improved system by the community itself. All five variables had the expected&#13;
coefficient signs for Option 2 and were statistically significant at the 1% level, indicating that survey results&#13;
are highly plausible.&#13;
4. The survey also asked sample households about their current participation in water supply management&#13;
and their interest in becoming more involved. Only 11% of respondents said their community made repairs on&#13;
its own, while the remainder stated that outside assistance was usually sought. Lack of funds and knowledge&#13;
for repairs were given as reasons to explain reliance on outside sources. However, 27 % of respondents stated&#13;
that it was highly probable that their community could run its own system, and 41 % said it could maybe do so.&#13;
The majority (56%) said that the community would want to run its own system, and 58% thought the service&#13;
would be better as a result. Fifty-nine percent thought that it would not be too difficult to serve on the&#13;
community's water committee, and 77% were somewhat or very interested in doing so.&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
National Institutional Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The water supply and sanitation (WS&amp;S) sector in Venezuela has undergone a&#13;
major restructuring over the past five years.  In spite of these efforts, the results have&#13;
proven insufficient and the sector as a whole remains "de facto" centralized with a complex&#13;
organizational structure. Many of the water-related agencies suffer from ill-defined and&#13;
overlapping statutory responsibilities and an undeveloped regulatory framework, private&#13;
sector participation remains limited and federal subsidies for operating costs as well as for&#13;
capital investment are required due to low tariffs, inadequate commercial practices and&#13;
inefficient administration that commonly result in deficient metering, partial billing and low&#13;
collection. Water resources management and wastewater management are also centralized&#13;
and the few experiences of management at the river basin level have remained fully&#13;
dependent on the central government and lacked financial viability.&#13;
2.    The current administration has given high importance to the water and sanitation&#13;
sector because of the acute problems in service delivery and the heavy fiscal burden of&#13;
present centralized management. The Government's policy for the sector, articulated in a&#13;
letter to the Bank, has as its key elements: i) accelerating the decentralization process and&#13;
building local institutional capacity for management; ii) developing a modem institutional&#13;
and regulatory framework; iii) improving cost-recovery and achieving financial self-&#13;
sufficiency; iv) increasing sector investment to an average annual 4% of total public&#13;
investment, concentrating on rehabilitation, expanded sewerage and treatment coverage and&#13;
greater access by the poor to WS&amp;S services; and v) improving efficiency and involving the&#13;
private sector in service delivery. The planned rehabilitation investment projects at the&#13;
estate and regional levels, including this project in the state of Monagas, will be&#13;
supported by the building of national and local institutional capacity and the improving of&#13;
technical and managerial skills, regulation, operation and maintenance of the services.&#13;
3.    The proposed modernization and improvement of the WS&amp;S services in&#13;
Venezuela require: a) a sound regulatory framework and the strengthening of the national&#13;
water related agencies; b) sector development and decentralization at the regional level,&#13;
replicating the Monagas experience in other states, and c) improvement of sector wide&#13;
management and technical capacity. Similarly, the introduction of national standards to&#13;
be developed under the project and the adoption of state and municipal regulations and&#13;
new commercial rules will demand specialized support to fulfill the legal roles and a&#13;
better social understanding of the new  sectoral reality.  For these reasons, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H&#13;
Page 2 of 23&#13;
Government has requested the support of the Bank for institution building in the sector in&#13;
the context of the proposed project. The project's National Institutional Component,&#13;
which will be co-financed with the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB), includes&#13;
financial support to assist the Government in carrying out its sectoral strategy.&#13;
Program Objectives&#13;
4.    To assist and promote the modernization of the Venezuelan water supply and&#13;
sanitation sector, the National Institutional Component will finance consultant services&#13;
and equipment to HIDROVEN, in order to:&#13;
(a)   assist in the adoption and development of a Regulatory Framework&#13;
proposal;&#13;
(b)   create and/or strengthen national sector institutions;&#13;
(c)   increase technical and managerial capacity at the national, as well as local&#13;
level to regulate, plan and operate these services;&#13;
(d)   stimulate a broad social support for the modernization of WS&amp;S, and the&#13;
rational use of the water resources;&#13;
(e)   prepare training and dissemination material; and&#13;
(f)   facilitate the preparation of four projects, to duplicate the model developed&#13;
in Monagas.&#13;
Content of the National Institutional Component&#13;
5.    The National Institutional Component will support three different programs:&#13;
Technical Assistance Program, TAP&#13;
National Training Program, NTP&#13;
*     Sector Decentralization Program, SDP&#13;
6.    The Technical Assistance Program will assist in the implementation of the&#13;
Regulatory Framework which is currently under design with support from a PHRD Grant&#13;
from the Government of Japan and the Bank. It will finance consultant services and&#13;
equipment for:&#13;
(a)   institutional strengthening of national sector institutions (HIDROVEN and&#13;
the regulatory agency or agencies to be defined), including: (i) a study to&#13;
define the organizational structure of the sector according to the proposed&#13;
Regulatory Framework;  (ii) technical assistance for the Regulatory&#13;
Agencies and HIDROVEN and (iii) implementation of a Management&#13;
information system in HIDROVEN and the preparation of an inventory of&#13;
basic sectoral information needed to plan, regulate and provide technical&#13;
assistance to sector institutions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H&#13;

(b)   preparation of sectoral norms and standards; and&#13;
(c)    development and implementation of general policies for: (i) management&#13;
of shared water resources and related infrastructure; (ii) management of&#13;
rural water systems and (iii) institutional organization and promotion of&#13;
private sector participation.&#13;
(d)   development and implementation of a national Management Information&#13;
System for the sector&#13;
7.    Additionally, this subcomponent will finance studies, equipment and related&#13;
consulting services to support the design, creation and functioning of a Users&#13;
Hydrographic Confederation (CH) for the management of water resources in the Amana&#13;
and Guarapiche river basins, in the state of Monagas, as a demonstration case. The design&#13;
will be based on the idea that effective water resources management is best achieved&#13;
through an organization that: (i) is given the authority to establish and implement a water&#13;
resources plan; (ii) meets the goal of financial sustainability; and (iii) is locally based,&#13;
represents the users and stakeholders in a river basin and responds and is financially&#13;
dependent from them. Since the main role of the CH will be to develop and implement&#13;
management criteria and principles to plan for the allocation and protection of water&#13;
resources in this area, this sub-component will also provide support to the CH for the&#13;
development of a basic information systems for these river basins and for the preparation&#13;
of this management plan and for setting up the necessary institutional capacity to&#13;
implement it. Preliminary work for the design of the CH has been carried out with the&#13;
help of a grant from the Spanish government.&#13;
8.    The National Training Program will:&#13;
(a)   increase technical capacity at the national and local government level in&#13;
order to promote the implementation of a modem regulatory and&#13;
institutional framework;&#13;
(b)   improve technical and managerial skills of professionals and decision&#13;
makers of the WS&amp;S sector; and&#13;
(c)   stimulate appreciation and understanding among society of the importance&#13;
of rational use and conservation of water resources.&#13;
9.    The Sector Decentralization Program will finance the preparation of four new&#13;
full rehabilitation projects replicating the model developed in Monagas. The Program will&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   preparation of investment plans for the physical rehabilitation of the&#13;
systems and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex H&#13;

(b)   technical, legal, institutional and financial studies necessary to define the&#13;
decentralization projects according to the model developed in Monagas.&#13;
10.   These three programs are presented in detail in Appendices 1, 2 and 3 to this&#13;
annex.&#13;
Component Implementation Arrangements.&#13;
11.   HIDROVEN would be responsible for carrying out the National Institutional&#13;
Component through a sub-project management unit. This unit will be created under the&#13;
supervision of HIDROVEN's Presidency and will be responsible for:&#13;
(a)   preparing final proposals and Terms of Reference for the Program's&#13;
activities and their submission for the Bank's approval;&#13;
(b)   procurement of consultant services and equipment needed for the&#13;
execution of each Program;&#13;
(c)   supervising and evaluating the consultants and services provided;&#13;
(d)   preparing progress reports to be presented to Bank's and contracting&#13;
yearly and overall evaluation studies of this component;&#13;
(e)   administering the component's execution;&#13;
(f)   providing support and supervision for the execution of the regional&#13;
rehabilitation project in Monagas and for the sector decentralization&#13;
program in four additional regional water companies; and&#13;
(g)   overall project coordination and monitoring.&#13;
12.   The unit will be under the direction of a General Manager. It will be staffed with&#13;
specialists hired as consultants to advise the General Manager on legal and institutional&#13;
development issues.  Additional staffing for project management assistance to the&#13;
General Manager will be provided through a consultant services contract that will include&#13;
professional and support services and related equipment needs. Financing of these&#13;
consultant services will be provided through the Bank loan at an estimated cost of US$&#13;
480,000 per year, to be contracted on a bi-annual basis. Submission to the Bank of terms&#13;
of reference for the management assistance contract was a condition of negotiations. The&#13;
signing of these contracts will be a condition of effectiveness. Agreements were reached&#13;
during negotiations on: (i) the personnel and expertise that HIDROVEN should maintain&#13;
in the sub-project management unit; and (ii) the content of the support to be provided&#13;
through the hiring of specialized consultant and through the consultant service contract&#13;
for project management assistance, which should be hired and maintained by&#13;
HIDROVEN.&#13;
13.   The component's Programs will be revised on a yearly basis for the purposes of&#13;
implementing any necessary adjustments and for monitoring purposes. Yearly (after the&#13;
second year) and overall monitoring studies will be contracted by the sub-project&#13;

NATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM&#13;
Program objective&#13;
1.    The modernization process of the WS&amp;S service in Venezuela must overcome&#13;
two main human resources impediments. The first one is related to the lack of technical&#13;
and managerial skills of decision-makers responsible for sector's regulations, norms and&#13;
policies and the managers and technical personnel responsible for the operation and&#13;
administration of the services. The second impediment to be overcome has to do with the&#13;
citizens' awareness with regard to the necessity of rational use of water resources and&#13;
their commitment to pay in accordance to the quality of the service.&#13;
2.    The main purpose of the proposed National Training Program (NTP) would be to&#13;
overcome impediments to the modernization of Venezuela's water sector. The NTP has&#13;
three objectives:  (i) to build support for the new regulatory framework and the&#13;
Venezuelan modernization process; (ii) to train a nucleus of professionals and decision-&#13;
makers in basic technical and managerial concepts of WS&amp;S services; and (iii) to&#13;
stimulate appreciation and understanding of the importance of rational use and&#13;
conservation of water resources.&#13;
Content of the NTP&#13;
3.    To accomplish these objectives, an integrated training program will be financed&#13;
by the project. The NTP will be organized and carried out through three sub-programs&#13;
defined according to the beneficiaries:&#13;
* Support for the new regulatory framework and sectoral modernization process&#13;
*  Managerial and technical training and&#13;
* Users awareness campaign.&#13;
Sub-program I. Support for the new regulatory framework and sectoral&#13;
modernization process&#13;
4.    This sub-program is oriented towards promoting the approval and implementation&#13;
of the new Regulatory Framework and its relates policies, norms and standards, in&#13;
accordance to the results of the study carried out in the Technical Assistance Program.&#13;
This implies: (i) the approval of legal reforms at the National Congress, and the approval&#13;
of resolutions and by-laws by the Executive branch, and (ii) the approval of municipal&#13;
laws and regulations in accordance with the proposed Normative and Regulatory&#13;
&#13;

international seminar in Venezuela for the purpose of disseminating and discussing the&#13;
tendencies and state of the art in the field of WS&amp;S Regulatory Frameworks. About sixty&#13;
professionals and authorities from Venezuela and forty representatives from abroad will&#13;
attend the Seminar. Sixty percent of the Venezuelan participants will represent the&#13;
Legislative Branch either at the National or the Regional level and the remaining forty&#13;
percent will include authorities from the Executive Branch and WS&amp;S companies.&#13;
Priority will be given to the attendance of Council Members and authorities from those&#13;
regions where the implementation of the Regulatoly Framework is already under&#13;
discussion and where the transfer process of the service is underway.&#13;
7.    Special Workshops. These will provide an opportunity for thorough discussion&#13;
regarding the submitted proposals and their consequence on the future development of the&#13;
sector.  Ten two-day workshops are proposed for an attendance of about fifteen&#13;
participants each: eight from the legislative branch, four from the executive branch and&#13;
three consultants who will coordinate the discussions. These workshops will be held in&#13;
different regions: two at the National Congress, three in Caracas Metropolitan Area&#13;
Municipalities and five at regional level.&#13;
Sub-program II. Managerial and Technical Training&#13;
8.    This sub-program is oriented towards a short-term training of a nucleus of&#13;

over service responsibilities and management related to the respective integrated water&#13;
system from the corresponding HIDRO,&#13;
. provision of start-up working capital to the new company by the regional&#13;
government and the municipalities, equivalent to no less than 10% of the proposed&#13;
Technical Assistance Program and&#13;
*  the commitment to adopt cost-recovery practices and financial sustainability, and&#13;
to promote private sector participation.&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Technical Assistance Program&#13;
for the Creation of a Users' Hydrographic Confederation&#13;
for Water Resources Management in the State of Monagas&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The management of water resources in Venezuela is de facto centralized in the&#13;
Ministry of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (MARNR), which&#13;
formulates policies, sets water quality standards and controls most water-related&#13;
(particularly water supply and sanitation) investments as well as their operation and&#13;
maintenance. Several other national, state and local agencies are also involved in water&#13;
resources management, but these operate without coordination, a comprehensive&#13;
management approach or a clear policy or strategy for integration between them. As a&#13;
result of this situation, although water policy formulation is technically the responsibility&#13;
of MARNR, the Ministry of Agriculture and Breeding (MAC) separately plans,&#13;
constructs and manages irrigation, and, similarly, although water quality standards are&#13;
established at the national level by MARNR according to the type of water body, the&#13;
Ministry of Health and Social Assistance (MSAS) sets water standards whenever issues&#13;
related to the protection of public health are or might be involved. With respect to water&#13;
supply and sanitation, some of MARNR's centralized control responsibilities have been&#13;
delegated to HIDROVEN, a state-owned corporation, when sector restructuring and&#13;
decentralization begun in 1990. HIDROVEN, wholly owned b-y MARNR, oversees&#13;
water supply and sanitation services that are provided through regional water companies,&#13;
called HIDROS, which are themselves wholly owned by HIDROVEN.&#13;
2.    As part of the sector restructuring initiative, the government of Venezuela created&#13;
two river basin commissions in 1993 to decentralize and coordinate water resources&#13;
management in the Tuy River and Lake Valencia. However, these have failed to achieve&#13;
the objectives set for them, have not achieved sustainability and have remained fully&#13;
dependent from MARNR for their financial needs. The commissions were created&#13;
following a new institutional model to address problems of water and the environment&#13;
with a more decentralized approach, where public participation was presented as a key&#13;
component of the institutional framework (public meetings were held in the basins to&#13;
involve stakeholders in some planning decisions). In reality, the decision-making has&#13;
been maintained at the federal level. There is not a clear idea about the usefulness and&#13;
convenience of these commissions among officials in MARNR and the basin's&#13;
stakeholders have not been properly involved in its management and have remained un-&#13;
bound to requirements or decisions of financial significance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
3.    The state of Monagas is a good example of the difficult and complex institutional&#13;
framework of water management in Venezuela, since numerous agencies are operating in&#13;
the state without a comprehensive or integrated water resources management plan or&#13;
coordinating structure, either institutionally or through regulations. Indeed, water&#13;
resources management in Monagas involves: (i) local offices of MARNR; (ii) MSAS;&#13;
(iii) local offices of MAC; (iv) HIDROCARIBE-Monagas, the fully-owned subsidiary of&#13;
HIDROVEN for this state; and (v) Aguas de Monagas (AdM), the company formed by&#13;
the municipalities Mancomunidad and the state government which is being strengthened&#13;
under the proposed Bank project.&#13;
4.    Several important problems of water quantity and quality are being compounded&#13;
in Monagas by the combination of a growing pressure on water resources and divided&#13;
responsibilities among managing institutions, limited regulatory structure, lack of&#13;
adequate institutional capacity and weak financial incentives to implement water&#13;
resources planning and management. The state's urban areas have been steadily growing&#13;
in recent years (the capital and largest municipality in the state, Maturin, is experiencing&#13;
an annual rate of growth of 6.5 percent) and are already competing for increasingly scarce&#13;
resources with the main economic sectors, which are mainly based on the production of&#13;
oil and agriculture (crop and livestock, with plans for tripling of irrigated area in the next&#13;
decade). Municipal water supply systems are inadequately maintained and have lacked&#13;
the financial capacity, resulting in unreliable services, large losses, recurrent annual&#13;
periods of rationing and almost nonexistent wastewater treatment. Surface water quality&#13;
has, as a result, been degraded by industrial and domestic discharges which have&#13;
increased without corresponding investments in wastewater treatment or management.&#13;
Groundwater contamination is also thought to be widespread because of inadequate&#13;
sanitation practices, placing public health at risk, while monitoring and control measures&#13;
remain very weak and hundreds of wells are used for the supply without adequate control&#13;
of groundwater hydrology or quality.&#13;
5.    Although the creation of AdM is a step towards providing a more reliable and&#13;
efficient municipal water service, it does not addresses the allocation and protection of&#13;
water resources in the state and conflicts over water allocation and pollution will&#13;
probably grow in intensity if no action is taken in this area. To tackle this problem and&#13;
develop policies and experience that could be replicated in other parts of the country, the&#13;
project includes a technical assistance (TA) program to support the introduction of&#13;
integrated water resource management practices in the state of Monagas, through the&#13;
creation a Users' Hydrographic Confederation (CHU - Confederaci6n Hidrografica de&#13;
Usuarios) with heavy involvement of the basin's stakeholders. This action will help shift&#13;
decision-making activities from the central government to the region's stakeholders,&#13;
simplify and provide coordination in the institutional framework for the management of&#13;
water resources and will support the development of the principles, criteria and tools&#13;
necessary for tackling the physical issues mentioned above, particularly those related to&#13;
the allocation and protection of the resources. The principles and strategy used for the&#13;
implementation of this water resource management approach are described below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
Objectives and Strategy&#13;
6.    The inclusion of CHU in the project is based on the idea that effective water&#13;
resources management is best achieved through an organization that: (i) is given the&#13;
authority to establish and implement a water resources plan; (ii) meets the goal of&#13;
financial sustainability; and (iii) is locally based, represents the users and stakeholders in&#13;
a river basin and responds and is financially dependent from them. When these three&#13;
conditions are meet, it can be expected that there would be an inherent motivation to&#13;
efficiently allocate adequate volumes and sufficient quality for diverse uses, allocation&#13;
will be agreed upon by the users represented in CHU, and the degree of water quality&#13;
demanded by each water user and other stakeholders could be negotiated within the&#13;
organization. Because costs are covered among the stakeholders, the goals and the means&#13;
to reach these goals (in terms of water allocation and protection) can also be expected to&#13;
be cost-effective and financially sustainable.&#13;
7.    During project preparation, the Venezuelan authorities, with the support of&#13;
consultants financed by a grant from the Spanish government, evaluated the present&#13;
regulatory and institutional framework for water resources management, made a first&#13;
estimate of the possible solutions and developed and agreed to the above criteria. Based&#13;
on these criteria and on a preliminary assessment of the basic physical information&#13;
available, a decision was made that institutional development for water resource&#13;
management at the national level and for the state of Monagas should be based on a&#13;
comprehensive framework that accounts for the interdependencies among potentially&#13;
competing socioeconomic activities, while protecting aquatic ecosystems. Accordingly,&#13;
the TA to be provided will support the study, design and establishment of an effective&#13;
management framework through a strategy that relies on two key principles: (i)&#13;
management should be decentralized, with strong involvement of users and stakeholders,&#13;
and (ii) financial sustainability and self-sufficiency should be achieved through the&#13;
introduction of water use charges and pollution fees.&#13;
8.    The TA progran to be carried out through HIDROVEN would support the&#13;
establishment of CHU to manage water resources in the Amana and Guarapiche river&#13;
basins in the state of Monagas. Since the main role of CHU will be to develop and&#13;
implement management criteria and principles to plan for the allocation and protection of&#13;
water resources in this area, the TA program will also provide support to CHU for the&#13;
preparation of this management plan and for setting up the necessary institutional&#13;
capacity to implement it.&#13;
Description&#13;
9.    The TA program will be implemented in two phases: the first phase will support&#13;
the creation of the CHU; the second phase will provide technical support to help it&#13;
undertake its role. The first phase includes: (i) the development of a proposal for the&#13;
design of the institutional and legal framework necessary to create CHU and provide it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
with the instruments to operate and achieve financial sustainability; and (ii) the&#13;
preparation of a basic information system of water resources, to be used for the&#13;
development of a water resources model for planning.  The second phase, to be&#13;
implemented following the creation of the CHU, will provide technical support to the&#13;
CHU for the selection of objectives, strategies and alternatives that will be translated in a&#13;
Water Resources Management Plan and for setting up a water resources monitoring&#13;
system.&#13;
10.   Design of Users' Hydrographic Confederation. The creation of an organization&#13;
of users and stakeholders capable of water resources management requires an enabling&#13;
institutional and legal framework. To create this type of organization in Monagas, the&#13;
project will finance a study to: (i) identify and evaluate the institutional system and key&#13;
stakeholders involved in water management, and their roles, as specified by law as well&#13;
as those actually demonstrated in practice; (ii) analyze the laws, regulations and&#13;
responsibilities distribution relevant to water resource management; (iii) evaluate the&#13;
financial and economic implications of a decentralized management approach based on&#13;
stakeholders participation; and (iv) propose a design for CHU, drawing from experiences&#13;
in similar circumstances either in Venezuela or other countries, with identification of&#13;
institutional and legal modifications necessary to create a functioning organization with&#13;
financial viability.&#13;
11.   The study will particularly explore and identify methods for the selection of&#13;
stakeholders to participate in CHU, procedures for decision-making, and use of economic&#13;
instrunents based on pricing for water quality and quantity. Potential stakeholders would&#13;
include representatives from  water companies, municipalities, industry, commerce,&#13;
agriculture, NGOs, and affected government agencies. To define the decision making&#13;
role of CHU, the study will develop proposals for the procedures it will use to coordinate&#13;
arnong and resolve disputes between stakeholders and for evaluating the roles and&#13;
responsibilities of different interest groups. The design will also address the staffing&#13;
needs for the technical unit that will be needed to support CHU, drawing as much as&#13;
possible on the present planning office which MARNR has located in the state of&#13;
Monagas, both to serve as a core unit for this and to provide counterpart role in the&#13;
execution of this study.&#13;
12.   Basic Information System. The design of CHU and the sustainable management&#13;
of water resources requires accurate knowledge of the area to be managed, the involved&#13;
stakeholders and its physical, chemical, biological, and socioeconomic conditions,&#13;
translated into a form usable for decision-makers. To this end, building on the initial&#13;
analysis made by consultants during project preparation, the project will finance the&#13;
development of a basic information system that will include the study and analysis,&#13;
among others, of the following:&#13;
(a)   Appropriate basin boundary for water management by CHU;&#13;
(b)   Hydrology of ground and surface water resources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
(c)   Ground and surface water quality;&#13;
(d)   Socioeconomic activities related to the water sector, including the&#13;
financial mechanisms and charges in place in the management of water.&#13;
(e)   Current and projected water uses and demands;&#13;
(f)    Land use and management;&#13;
(g)   Existing  infrastructure for water supply, sanitation, flood control,&#13;
irrigation, etc.;&#13;
(h)   Waste and pollution flows to and from the basins;&#13;
(i)    Natural ecosystem; and&#13;
(j)    Water-related public health issues, including incidence of water related&#13;
disease;&#13;
13.   The basic information system will also include the preparation of a geographic&#13;
information system (GIS) on the water resources in the area to be managed by CHU, to&#13;
facilitate the management of the information and its use by stakeholders and policy-&#13;
makers. It will include information on the allocations of water, water quality conditions&#13;
and existing and planned infrastructure for water supply, flood control, irrigation,&#13;
hydropower and wastewater treatment. Gaps in data, or poor quality data will be&#13;
identified and estimated in this first phase of the project.&#13;
14.   Technical Support. Upon its creation, the main tasks of CHU will be to: (i) set&#13;
goals for the river basins; (ii) generate and evaluate strategies to achieve those goals;&#13;
(iii) evaluate and select the alternatives that will define the Water Resource Management&#13;
Plan; and (iv) implement this plan. The project will support the development of the first&#13;
three.&#13;
15.   To support the goal identification and prioritization process, the project will also&#13;
finance the preparation of a Water Resources Model to provide a tool with which the&#13;
members of CHU may gain an understanding of the impacts of alternative strategies of&#13;
water management. The model will be based on the basic information system and on&#13;
input from stakeholders as identified in the design study for the CHU. The model will&#13;
mathematically relate the data on water quantity and quality with economic and&#13;
environmental information in a multi-objective framework to examine the tradeoffs&#13;
between objectives, such as economic growth among competing sectors, public health&#13;
protection and environmental preservation. The model is not intended as a substitution&#13;
for the negotiation and iteration with stakeholders that must form the basis of CHU role,&#13;
but as a tool to support it and to facilitate the consideration and evaluation of the costs&#13;
and inputs of the full range of management strategies and alternatives available,&#13;
including: demand management, regulatory measures, supply management, public&#13;
education, water charges, pollution fees, new institutional arrangements, and&#13;
environmental reclamation. At a minimum, the model will allow the strategies to be&#13;
assessed for their environmental, socioeconomic, political, legal, institutional, and fiscal&#13;
constraints and impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

16.   Additional technical support will be provided through the financing of the&#13;
establishment of a monitoring program of water quality and ecosystem health, including&#13;
acquisition of monitoring equipment and computer hardware and software. This technical&#13;
support will contribute additional knowledge of the resource, as well as a tool to&#13;
understand how to manage the watershed and to evaluate and review the management&#13;
decisions.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
17.   HIDROVEN will be responsible for implementation and for the development of&#13;
the policies and institutional framework necessary for the creation of CHU and for their&#13;
evaluation for possible replication in other parts of the country, as part of the National&#13;
Institutional Component. HIDROVEN will prepare the terns of reference and administer&#13;
the studies and activities of this sub-component, incorporating the Monagas' offices of&#13;
MARNR --and to the extent possible other stakeholders through it-- in this process and in&#13;
the administration and evaluation of the studies. Under this approach, the Monagas&#13;
offices of MARNR will constitute the core unit of CHU design. Following the creation&#13;
of CHU, financial responsibility for the technical unit would be progressively transferred&#13;
from MARNR to CHU, once its financial mechanisms are put in place.&#13;
Loan Condition&#13;
18.   Submission of a reform proposal and implementation plan satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
for the creation of the Users' Hydrographic Confederation by July 31, 1997, and the&#13;
implementation of this plan would be loan conditions.&#13;
TA Program Cost Summary&#13;
19.   The total estimated cost for TA program for supporting the creation of CHU is&#13;
US$ 2,050,000. Individual costs of the different tasks it will finance, its instruments and&#13;
planned execution period are outlined in Table 1.&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Implementation Plan&#13;
1.    This annex details the Implementation Plan for the above project. It presents: (i)&#13;
project monitoring and reporting arrangements; (ii) Bank supervision requirements; and&#13;
(iii) project financing plan and work program. The annex also addresses the content of the&#13;
project's annual and mid-term implementation reviews and Bank supervision&#13;
requirements.&#13;
Project Monitoring and Reporting Arrangements&#13;
2.    Monitoring Indicators. Tables I and 2 at the end of this annex present the input,&#13;
output and impact/development indicators to be monitored during the implementation of&#13;
the project. Given the difficulty of measuring some of the project objectives success and&#13;
impact just by the use of numerical indicators, customer surveys will also be carried out&#13;
after two years and annually thereafter until the project is completed to help measure the&#13;
impact of the project on WS&amp;S services and customer satisfaction. Additionally, NGOs&#13;
will be contracted (one at the regional level and one at the national level) to evaluate the&#13;
achievement of the project's objectives at mid-term and at project completion. These&#13;
monitoring indicators and reports must be incorporated in the semi-annual reports to&#13;
provide the executing agencies and the Bank with a detailed assessment of how the&#13;
project is performing and which correcting measures should be adopted, if necessary.&#13;
They will be reconfirmed during negotiations and set forth in a letter from HIDROVEN&#13;
and AdM to the Bank that will complement the Loan Agreement.&#13;
3.    Three main groups can be identified in this whole set of monitoring tools,&#13;
according to their expected use:&#13;
(a) the first group is formed by the indicators and targets that will be monitored as&#13;
financial covenants for AdM of the project agreement (these are listed in table 4.1&#13;
of this SAR and in the Article IV of the project agreement);&#13;
(b) a second larger group is formed by the whole set of monitoring indicators and&#13;
performance targets for AdM's, which have to be substantially achieved for the&#13;
disbursement of the third package of rehabilitation investments. These are listed&#13;
in table 1 of this annex and in the schedule 1 of the project agreement with AdM&#13;
(they correspond to the targets of the Contract Plan between the state government,&#13;
the Mancomunidad, and AdM, and will be the key vehicle for monitoring&#13;
performance and compliance with agreed objectives in the regional component);&#13;
and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex J&#13;
Page 2ofll&#13;
(c) a third group is formed by the "key monitoring indicators" (input, output and&#13;
impact), which will be used by the Bank to measure implementation performance&#13;
and monitor the project's impact (these are listed in table 2 and 3 of this annex&#13;
and include part of the performance targets for AdM, as well as other monitoring&#13;
indicators for the national institutional component).&#13;
4.    Project Monitoring and Reporting Requirements. The executing agencies&#13;
(HIDROVEN and AdM) will be responsible for project monitoring activities and for&#13;
preparing semi-annual progress reports to be submitted by September 30 for the semester&#13;
ending June 30, and by March 31 for the semester ending December 31. The contents,&#13;
schedule and distribution of responsibilities are shown in Table 4 and 5 at the end of the&#13;
annex. The reports will also evaluate compliance with subloan conditionality by AdM,&#13;
each municipality and by the state government, and actions taken to enforce compliance.&#13;
In cases of unsatisfactory progress, the reports will detail proposals for adjustments and&#13;
corrective actions.&#13;
5.    Project monitoring capacity. Project monitoring capacity in the executing&#13;
agencies will be guaranteed by the establishment of accounting and financial reporting&#13;
systems acceptable to the Bank in both agencies before effectiveness, and by the&#13;
strengthening of their capacity through the financing of consultant services.  In&#13;
HIDROVEN, a consultant contract will be financed under the national institutional&#13;
component to support the management and monitoring of this component and the overall&#13;
coordination of the project, including major monitoring and reporting activities. In AdM,&#13;
a management contract will be entered with a private operator, that includes among its&#13;
responsibilities the monitoring and reporting of the project implementation (financial,&#13;
investment and quality performance indicators), and a consultant will be hired to provide&#13;
assistance to AdM's Board of directors to supervise project implementation and the&#13;
performance of the private operator. Both these consultant contracts and the management&#13;
contract with a private operator should be made effective for project effectiveness or&#13;
disbursement and maintained during project execution, to guarantee adequate monitoring&#13;
capacity in HIDROVEN and AdM.&#13;
6.    Additionally, as has been pointed out above, project evaluation studies with&#13;
NGOs and customer satisfaction surveys (among AdM customers) will be carried out&#13;
before the project's mid-term review and after completion, to evaluate its success and the&#13;
impact of those components that can not easily be measured by numerical indicators.&#13;
Base conditions (before project starts) are available from the willingness-to-pay studies&#13;
carried out and from a survey of environmental health to be carried out shortly with the&#13;
support of the PHRD grant from the government of Japan.&#13;
7.    Annual Reviews. Within two months of the submission of the semi-annual&#13;
report due on September 30 of each year, the Bank and the Government will conduct a&#13;
formal joint review of the progress made in implementing the strategy for the sector,&#13;
meeting the project's objectives and achieving agreed monitoring indicators. The review&#13;
would be based on the semi-annual progress reports submitted by AdM and HIDROVEN&#13;

according to the reporting schedule shown in tables 4 and 5, and on performance&#13;
according to the targets established in the Contract Plan. The agenda for the reviews, in&#13;
addition to evaluating the semi-annual reports, would include an assessment of the&#13;
adequacy and timeliness of the National Government budget allocation for the project for&#13;
meeting the investment needs of the following year. The discussion and analysis of these&#13;
issues will lead to the formulation of an action plan, satisfactory to the Bank, to be&#13;
prepared by AdM, HIDROVEN and the Government, the terms of which will be carried&#13;
out during the succeeding year.&#13;
8.    Mid-Term  Reviewv. The second annual review would constitute a Mid-Term&#13;
Review of project implementation, and provide an opportunity for a more comprehensive&#13;
review of the achievements of the project to date and of the prospects for successful&#13;
completion. In addition to the agenda items for annual reviews, the Mid-Term Review&#13;
will include: (a) analysis of the flow of funds and funds management; (b) performance&#13;
under the Contract Plan; (c) an evaluation of the remaining investment needs and&#13;
authorization of the third rehabilitation investment package; (d) an evaluation of project&#13;
success to date based on the evaluation made by a NGO for the national component and&#13;
another NGO for the regional component, as well as consumer satisfaction surveys for the&#13;
components executed by AdM; and (e) any proposals for restructuring or reorienting the&#13;
project in light of the reviews and assessments of the issues discussed during the Review.&#13;
Bank Supervision Requirements&#13;
9.    Given the project's comprehensive approach to sector reform and the demands of&#13;
supervising subprojects across Monagas and Venezuela, extensive and close supervision&#13;
will be required, especially during the first year of project implementation. A project&#13;
launch workslhop and yearly annual reviews will be organized, assisting the staff of&#13;
institutions participating in the project to maintain a common understanding of the&#13;
project's overall development objectives, operational procedures, coordination needs, and&#13;
potential implementation problems. The project launch workshop will take place within&#13;
30-45 days of loan effectiveness, and will focus on any necessary reviews and&#13;
adjustments in the implementation plan, project management and work prograrn,&#13;
procurement, disbursement, and auditing procedures and requirements.  The launch&#13;
workshop would last three to five days and should include the following staff: Task&#13;
Manager, Financial Analyst, Procurement Specialist, Disbursement Specialist and&#13;
Accounting Specialist.&#13;
10.   It is expected that at least three supervision missions per year (four in the first&#13;
year), staffed by an environmental engineer, a financial analyst and an specialist in human&#13;
resources and community participation, plus one technical specialist from the resident&#13;
mission, with a duration of about two weeks per mission, will be required to supervise the&#13;
project during its implementation. Bank missions should plan to visit the municipalities&#13;
where rehabilitation works are under way, at least once during construction and once&#13;
during the operation of the rehabilitated infrastructure, as well as HIDROVEN' offices in&#13;
Caracas in relation with the national component.  Other states integrated in the Sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Decentralization Program will be visited as time and resources permit. For the first year,&#13;
including the project launch workshop, the supervision requirements are estimated at&#13;
about 45 to 50 staff weeks (about 15 staff weeks from the resident mission, mainly for&#13;
day to day supervision). Supervision requirements will fall to about 35 to 40 staff weeks&#13;
per year thereafter (about 10 to 15 staff weeks per year from the resident mission).&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
AdM Finances&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Aguas de Monagas (AdM) is a newly established company, created with limited&#13;
operating capital and no assets, and staffed only by the core personnel needed to manage&#13;
the transfer of operations from HIDROCARIBE, the regional water company, and&#13;
prepare this project. It took over the commercial part of the service in July 1995. In&#13;
January 1996 it became responsible for the WS&amp;S services in the entire state in&#13;
substitution of HIDROCARIBE.  AdM  has inherited a service saddled by poor&#13;
management, weak commercial practices, bad culture of payment, low billing and&#13;
collection rates (61 and 56 percent respectively for the whole state in 1994 and 52 and 27&#13;
for 1995, the year of the transfer) and insufficient tariff levels (17.5 Bs/m3 for residential&#13;
consumers and 10 Bs/m3 for low income "social" consumers).&#13;
2.    AdM's main challenge is to overcome and correct the main financial and&#13;
commercial problems that affected HIDROCARIBE's performance, rehabilitate seriously&#13;
deteriorated physical infrastructure and improve service quality. Consequently, better&#13;
billing and collection procedures and reduction of the high unaccounted-for-water are&#13;
critical features of AdM's reform agenda and represent essential elements needed to&#13;
achieve its two key objectives in the financial area: (i) develop and maintain the financial&#13;
sustainability of the company; and (ii) guarantee the availability of sufficient working&#13;
capital for an adequate operation and for undertaking the required rehabilitation&#13;
investment plan.&#13;
Financial Model and Projections&#13;
3.    AdM's financial model and projections are included in the tables at the end of this&#13;
annex. They show that under the assumptions adopted, AdM will be sustainable and able&#13;
to reduce its dependency from national government transfers early in project execution&#13;
and cover most of the needed counterpart for the planned investment program, having a&#13;
positive net cash flow and income at the end of project execution. These projections were&#13;
prepared for this Staff Appraisal Report in June 1995 and updated on November 1995 and&#13;
April 1996, during negotiations. Main assumptions used for the preparation of AdM's&#13;
financial projections are summarized in table 1.&#13;
4.    AdM is expected to generate operating and net incomes on the order of 22% and&#13;
13%, respectively, of revenues by the end of project execution, cover about 33% of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

investments by 1999 and 2000 and 100% thereafter, and maintain a debt service coverage&#13;
ratio above 1.5 after 2000 and over 2 after 2002, and a quick ratio over 6 during project&#13;
execution and over 1.5 after project execution. Rates of return on invested capital are&#13;
projected by the model to meet or exceed 5% on revalued assets on 2006. A study to&#13;
identify and reevaluate the service's assets and liabilities and the assets transferred under&#13;
Comodatum has been carried out during project preparation. These assets (presently&#13;
under HIDROCARIBE, MARNR and the municipalities) have been transferred to AdM,&#13;
upon the transfer of the service from HIDROCARIBE to AdM, and properly accounted&#13;
for (the model takes into consideration assets valued about 2,346 million Bs, that were&#13;
registered in HIDROCARIBE's accounts for 1995).&#13;

5.    HIDROCARIBE before and AdM now follow Venezuela's generally accepted&#13;
accounting and auditing principles, which are similar to those internationally recognized,&#13;
although their practices suffer from some deficiencies. Financial statements are audited&#13;
by a national firm that is appointed by the Director of the company. As part of project&#13;
preparation, the Bank is providing assistance to AdM (as well as to HIDROVEN) to&#13;
strengthen its accounting system and address deficiencies in this area before eligible&#13;
investments are initiated.&#13;
Working Capital&#13;
6.   Initial working capital for AdM will be provided through the combination of three&#13;
mechanisms: (i) AdM will collect all accounts receivable as of July 1995, when it took&#13;
over the commercial management of the service, and keep 40% of these payments; (ii)&#13;
for the period between July and December 1995, HIDROCARIBE will cover the&#13;
operating deficit of AdM using the reallocated funds received from the national&#13;
government for the operation of the service in the state of Monagas in 1995; and (iii) a&#13;
revolving fund will be created in AdM for the financing of the project investments&#13;
through the reimbursement by the Bank of the expenses eligible for retroactive financing&#13;
executed by HIDROCARIBE, that will be fully covered by grant contributions from the&#13;
state and national governments budgeted investment funds. The amounts to be received&#13;
through these three mechanisms have been estimated in: (i) 125 million Bs from pending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
accounts receivable, (ii) 242 million Bs to cover AdM financial deficit in 1995; and (iii)&#13;
545 million Bs to finance the planned investments that will be eligible for retroactive&#13;
financing by the Bank under the proposed project (the revolving fund will be initially&#13;
constituted by the Bank disbursements, estimated at 265 million Bs).&#13;
7.    According to AdM's adopted policy, cash requirements have been projected to&#13;
maintain additional cash to cover at least two months of the operating expenses (less non-&#13;
receivable accounts) and short term investments projected for each year. Submission of a&#13;
plan satisfactory to the Bank for the provision of working capital for AdM would be&#13;
condition of negotiations.&#13;
Statement of Financial Results. Revenues&#13;
8.    Tariff Revenues. HIDROCARIBE's and now AdM's tariff structure follows the&#13;
1993 joint Ministerial Resolution of the Ministry of the Environment and Renewable&#13;
Natural Resources (MARNR) and the Ministry of Finance. Tariffs for residential, social&#13;
(low  income residential consumers), commercial, industrial and official users were&#13;
calculated by HIDROCARIBE against the residential tariff (referential residential tariff)&#13;
selected for each WS&amp;S system, according to its characteristics (five reference levels&#13;
were established in the Resolution).&#13;
9.    The Resolution also establishes a formula to adjust the referential residential&#13;
tariff according to changes in the cost of labor, chemicals, energy and maintenance&#13;
contracts. However, this formula was never applied by HIDROCARIBE and tariff levels&#13;
have been eroded below what would be necessary to maintain the financial viability of&#13;
the company. Until 1995, tariffs remained at 17.5 Bs/m3 for residential, 10 Bs/m3 for&#13;
social and around 50 Bs/m3 for industrial, commercial and official users (level 4) in&#13;
Maturfn, and even lower in the rest of the state (normally at level 3, with 15, 7.5 and&#13;
around 40 Bs/m3 for residential, social and other users, respectively). Additionally, the&#13;
great majority of consumers were billed on a non-metered flat consumption rate (30 and&#13;
15 m3 per month for residential and social users respectively) and a disproportional large&#13;
number of consumers are classified as social. This, combined with the inefficient billing&#13;
and collection practice of HIDROCARIBE, produced largely insufficient tariff revenues.&#13;
10.   During project preparation, the referential residential tarif was increased in June&#13;
3        ~~~3                                       3&#13;
1995, from 17.5 Bs/m3 to 40 Bs/m3, and will be further increased to 60 Bs/m as a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness (the social tariff will also be raised to 20 Bs/m3 and&#13;
industrial and commercial tariffs to 100 Bs/m3). These increases have been adopted by&#13;
the authorities to bring tariff revenues to levels that make the AdM financially viable, but&#13;
also to overcome the difficulty that tariffs increases would face due to the lack of a clear&#13;
regulatory framework and distribution of responsibilities in this area, should they be&#13;
I     This amount is calculated as 60% of the projected non-collectible accounts at the end of the year.&#13;
It is not included in the financial projection due to its uncertainty and in order to be on the safe side.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K&#13;

phased latter into project execution. It is also the policy of AdM to unify tariff levels in&#13;
the state, review those consumers classified as social and apply the formula provided by&#13;
the Resolution to update the referential residential tariff on a continuous basis to&#13;
maintain its value in real terms (this can be done without the intervention of the national&#13;
government, requiring only the approval of the Mancomunidad). Accordingly, the&#13;
financial projections assume that about 10,000 social consumers will be reclassified as&#13;
residential, newly billed consumers will be billed as residential and tariff levels will be&#13;
adjusted to reflect changes in the costs of labor, chemicals, energy and operation&#13;
contracts. Although not considered for the financial projections, an assessment will be&#13;
made during project execution of the tariff structure, the cost structure, the marginal cost&#13;
of the service and the provisions for adequate enforcing and tariff levels and structure will&#13;
be accordingly reviewed.&#13;
11.   Billing, Collection and Unaccounted-for-water. Present rates for billing,&#13;
collection, unaccounted-for-water and metering are forecasted to improve according to&#13;
the targets established under the Contract Plan (see table 2 below which summarizes&#13;
some of the assumptions used for setting these targets). These targets have been&#13;
developed during project preparation, on the basis of: (i) conservative estimations of the&#13;
improvements that are considered to be achievable in the commercial and physical&#13;
performance of the company; (ii) the help of a private operator to be hired under a&#13;
management contract;  and (iii) experience from similar water utilities.  Accounts&#13;
receivable are forecasted to be reduced to about two months from present four months&#13;
and special tariff reduction for municipal water consumption will be discontinued as a&#13;
result of project preparation agreements. Unaccounted-for-water is also estimated to&#13;
decrease to about 40% (from 70% in 1994) at the end of project execution and an&#13;
additional 10% during the following years.&#13;
Table 2. Performance Targets for AdM&#13;

12.   To achieve these targets the management contract with a private operator will link&#13;
part of the payment to improvements in the rate of unaccounted-for-water and billing and&#13;
collection efficiency and AdM will concentrate the investments planned under the project&#13;
in the rehabilitation of the system and in the introduction of macrometering to production&#13;

volume of water consumed per customer is maintained at present levels and the&#13;
population will grow at a rate of about 2.8 percent per year.&#13;
13.   Other Revenues. Other revenues are estimated to be negligible in the financial&#13;
projections. However, with improved financial results and a liberalized financial sector,&#13;
treasury operations within AdM could begin to contribute to the revenues of the&#13;
company, particularly at the end of the project execution, when cash balances will be&#13;
substantially better.&#13;

14.   Impact of inflation. Average expected inflation and exchange rates are shown in&#13;
table 3 below. These projections reflect the impact of the recent devaluation. They have&#13;
been adopted on the assumption that local inflation will remain high for the next years,&#13;
decreasing the difference between local and international inflation rates only in the order&#13;
of 40% each year, from a 1996 inflation rate of about 80% to about 9% in the year 2000,&#13;
and that the official exchange rate will not reflect 20% of this difference. The effect on&#13;
AdM's financial performance that a possible worsening of the present unstable&#13;
macroeconomic situation of the country, over these already pessimistic projections, is&#13;
analyzed as part of the risk section of this annex (para 29 and 30).&#13;

15.   Financial projections have been made on the basis of the operating costs and&#13;
efficiency indicators of the system under HIDROCARIBE's management, that are&#13;
considered conservative. Cost of energy, chemicals, labor and operation contracts are&#13;
expected to increase according to local inflation (see table 4). However, changes in the&#13;
cost for AdM of energy, chemicals and local purchases are only expected to reflect 50, 30&#13;
and 80% respectively of the variation of the local inflation (unit labor costs changes will&#13;
reflect 100%) due to the particular characteristics of the supply of energy and chemicals&#13;
in Venezuela (up to now, electricity was not paid by HIDROCARIBE and chemicals are&#13;
obtained from sub-products of large national industries) and to the rigidity of operation&#13;
contracts.&#13;
16.   Personnel Costs. After taking the WS&amp;S system in Monagas over from INOS,&#13;
HIDROCARIBE operated it through annual contracts with local operating companies and&#13;
engineering firms (mainly formed by former INOS staff) that provided personnel,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
equipment and some maintenance costs, while concentrating itself in the commercial&#13;
management and in the overall supervision and planning. As a result, HIDROCARIBE's&#13;
staff in Monagas was small (about 60 positions among management, commercial and&#13;
engineering departments). It is the policy of AdM to maintain this approach under the&#13;
overall management by the private operator. To this end, AdM received the commercial&#13;
management of the company in July 1995 after HIDROCARIBE had made redundant the&#13;
corresponding staff. Subsequently, AdM rehired only about 30 of the corresponding staff&#13;
on an interim basis, to be confirmed by the private operator. Additionally, one of the first&#13;
tasks of the private operator will be the reformulation and renegotiation of the contracts&#13;
with the local operating companies. As part of the Contract Plan agreements between&#13;
AdM and its stockholders, AdM, and through it the private operator, will have complete&#13;
autonomy in their hiring/redundancy policy and decisions. AdM staff is not unionized&#13;
and professional and technical staff wages are governed by public sector wage laws.&#13;

17.   The financial projections assume that personnel costs will constitute about the&#13;
same proportion of O&amp;M costs as today. It also assumes that personnel costs will&#13;
represent about 75% of administration costs.&#13;
18.   Depreciation. Fixed assets will be reevaluated annually according to inflation.&#13;
The average annual depreciation rate is assumed to be 4%, calculated using a straight line&#13;
method.&#13;
19.   Taxes. AdM pays the general tax to local purchases of equipment and goods&#13;
(12.5 %), income tax (30%) and assets tax (0.25% on fixed active assets). AdM is&#13;
exempt from municipal taxes.&#13;
20.   Financial Expenses. Since AdM does not have any outstanding debt service,&#13;
only interest charges corresponding to the subloan between AdM and the national&#13;
government for the transfer of project proceeds are included as financial expenses in the&#13;
projections. These peak at about 3,200 million Bs in year 2001 to diminish later. In&#13;
order to control AdM's indebtedness, targets will also be included for the debt service&#13;
coverage ratio, that should remain above 2 through the end of the repayment period,&#13;
considering additional yearly investments in the order of 5% of fixed assets after project&#13;
completion (these investment program has been built into the financial projection for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K&#13;
Page 7 of 12&#13;
project). Interests of the subloan will be capitalized and re-financed during the four years&#13;
construction period.&#13;
Flow of Funds. Sources&#13;
21.   Internal Cash Generation. With the conservative assumptions used in the&#13;
financial projections, AdM is expected to maintain adequate working capital and a&#13;
positive cash balance during project execution, and to generate increasingly positive&#13;
balances from this year onwards. AdM is expected to cover 12, 17 and about 33 % of&#13;
investment needs in years 1997, 1998 and 1999 and 2000 and 100% from that year.&#13;
22.   Government Grant Transfers. National, state and local support is expected to&#13;
continue in 1996 to cover cash operating deficits and into 1998 to contribute to&#13;
counterpart funds in 1997 and 1998, when it will cease. A grant contribution of 301&#13;
million Bs from the national government is projected as necessary in 1,996 to cover the&#13;
operation deficit and about 4,900 million Bs are projected to cover counterpart financing&#13;
of the planned investment program (about 12% of the roughly 42,400 million Bs&#13;
investment program).&#13;
23.   Loans.  AdM's debt only includes the subsidiary loan with the national&#13;
government for the transfer of project proceeds. Smaller bridge loans from commercial&#13;
banks have not been considered in the financial projections, although they might be&#13;
probably necessary. Other indebtedness of AdM will be limited by the agreed targets on&#13;
the debt service coverage ratio (equal or higher than 2 for the repayment period) that the&#13;
company must maintain.&#13;
Flow of Funds. Uses&#13;
24.   Debt Service. The targets given for AdM financial performance and debt service&#13;
coverage are relatively modest based on the improved profit performance and expected&#13;
stronger cash flow projected for the company. Additionally, the financing requirements&#13;
for the investment program (about 5% of fixed assets by year on year 2,001, increasing to&#13;
9% on year 2,006) represent a relatively pessimistic estimate of the investments AdM&#13;
will require to improve service quality and maintain it after project completion.&#13;
25.  Investment Program. AdM investment program is based on the analysis of the&#13;
works and actions that are required to improve service quality in Monagas and correct the&#13;
main causes for weak management of the service in the past. It also includes investments&#13;
in the order of 5% of fixed assets after project completion, raising to 9% from year 2,005&#13;
and onwards. Yearly investment projections are summarized in table 5 below. They&#13;
represent an increase of about four times over the normal yearly investment budget&#13;
allocated to the state of Monagas by MARNR (through HIDROCARIBE) and the state&#13;
government in recent years (on average, about 800 million Bs yearly).&#13;

Financial Risks&#13;
26.   As a new company with a low level of permanent personnel and tariff levels&#13;
which have been adjusted in line with projected financial needs prior to project execution,&#13;
AdM starts off on a financial footing stronger than many similar companies supported by&#13;
Bank projects. Nevertheless, it faces initially other financial risks primarily related to&#13;
operating in a high inflationary environment for the next several years, including&#13;
expected devaluation of the currency and variable and high interest rates under the&#13;
proposed onlending arrangements. This environment will only make the movement from&#13;
a culture of non-payment for water supply and sanitation services to achievement of&#13;
financial autonomy for AdM more difficult.&#13;
27.   Also related is the risk associated to the availability of the funds that are expected&#13;
from the national government, both for the investments that are planned to be carried out&#13;
before project effectiveness (which are linked to the initial provision of working capital to&#13;
AdM) and for counterpart contribution. A possible worsening of the macroeconomic&#13;
situation might aggravate this risk, although it is mitigated by: (i) the strong commitment&#13;
of national and local government authorities to the decentralization process and to the&#13;
concept of financial sustainability in general and to the project in particular, evidenced by&#13;
budgetary allocations made for this project under the Ley Paraguas (despite stiff public&#13;
expenditure cuts');  (ii) the agreed obligations of the state government and the&#13;
municipalities under the Contract Plan, including the tariff increase adopted during&#13;
project preparation and the tariff increase to be adopted before loan effectiveness; (iii) a&#13;
financing plan that seeks to reduce dependency from national budget support early in&#13;
project implementation; and (iv) by the grouping of the works to be financed under the&#13;
project into three rehabilitation packages that can be independently carried out, linked to&#13;
the achievement of financial and operation conditions.&#13;
28.   The project has been designed to lessen the financial risks through: (i) the&#13;
agreement for the capital subsidy from the national government during the early years of&#13;
project execution justified by the serious state of neglect and disrepair that characterizes&#13;
the system being turned over to the local authorities; (ii) getting clarity on the project's&#13;
financial needs by holding discussions with a wide circle of stakeholders in the executive&#13;
I     Although these allocations have been approved and maintained in the recent budget cuts, they&#13;
have not yet been made available since they are linked to the issuance of the national debt bonds, which&#13;
has not been made yet for 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K&#13;
Page 9 of 12&#13;
and legislative branches of the national government and local governments and broad&#13;
consultation with the affected communities and agreeing on mutual obligations, formalized&#13;
in the project's Contract Plan; (iii) utilizing the services of a private operator to introduce&#13;
efficiencies before tariff adjustments are made, and provide tangible evidence of improved&#13;
services to make the tariff adjustments, when required, more supportable; and (iv) linking&#13;
the third package of rehabilitation investments with compliance with the agreed financial&#13;
and operating targets of the Contract Plan. In essence, therefore, the principal risk to the&#13;
financial viability of the project relates to the political willingness to: (a) make future&#13;
adjustments to tariffs in the context of high domestic inflation and adjustments to the&#13;
exchange rate;  and (b) maintain the agreed national government's counterpart&#13;
contributions. To highlight the impact of these key factors on the company's finances, the&#13;
following analysis looking at possible changes introduced by lower-than-expected revenues,&#13;
exchange rate and domestic inflation impacts and slower reductions in unaccounted-for-&#13;
water was carried out and is shown below.&#13;
29.   Internal Revenue Risks. AdM's most important risk is associated with lower-&#13;
than-expected revenues, either because of delays, reduction or lack of adoption of tariff&#13;
level adjustments, or because collection/billing/accounted-for-water efficiency is not&#13;
improved according to projected targets. Should either of these two factors take place,&#13;
they would have a large impact on AdM's finances and could make the company's&#13;
investment program not viable. This can be seen in tables 6 and 7 below, which show the&#13;
large impact that would have a fall in tariffs and collection rates of 5-20% below what is&#13;
projected on the net income, net cash flow (aggregated between 1997 and 2001) and&#13;
required government support (aggregated between 1996 and 2000 for investments). As&#13;
can be seen in these tables, decreases of just 5% in the tariff increases that would result&#13;
from the application of the adjustment formula would reduce net income and cash flow&#13;
by 29 and 47% respectively, and require an increment of grant support of 23%, with&#13;
similar impacts for reductions in the billing efficiency below the agreed targets.&#13;
Decreases in the order of 20% would make the company and the investment plan&#13;
financially un-viable.&#13;

30.   However, this risk in unlikely because it is expected that restrictions on national&#13;
government expenditures during the project execution period will not likely permit a&#13;
return to the centralized pattern of funding of investment of the past, forcing local&#13;
authorities to comply with the provisions of the contract plan and ensure than tariffs are&#13;
maintained at the agreed levels, in line with the recent tariff increases adopted before&#13;
negotiations. The involvement of a private operator to manage AdM will also contribute&#13;
to mitigate this risk through the introduction of better management and commercial&#13;
practices.&#13;
31.   Exchange Rate Risk. AdM's principal exchange rate exposure is linked to the&#13;
impact it would have on the cost of imported goods and services to be financed under the&#13;
project and on the debt service of the bolivar-denominated subloan that this increase of&#13;
costs would generate (exchange rate risks for loan repayment will remain with the&#13;
national government). The impact on net income, net cash flow and required government&#13;
support of 5-40% increases of the expected official exchange rate at the end of 1997 are&#13;
presented in table 8 below. As can be seen, the impact of further devaluations is small&#13;
(mainly due to the automatic adjustment of tariffs), and this risk's impact might be further&#13;
mitigated by reductions in the proposed investment plan or small increments in the grant&#13;
contributions from the national government.&#13;

corresponding rates are shown&#13;
32.   Domestic Inflation Rate Risk. AdM's exposure to domestic inflation is mainly&#13;
linked to the impact it might have on the exchange rate and less to the impact it will have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K&#13;
Page 11 of 12&#13;
on operation and maintenance costs. If tariffs are adjusted according to the adjustment&#13;
formula, the impact could even be positive on the net income figures in current bolivares.&#13;
In the following table 9 the impact on the net income, net cash flow and required&#13;
government support of 5-40% increments in the expected domestic inflation rate are&#13;
shown to be small.&#13;

3X3. Interest Rate of Subsidiary Loan. The interest rate for the subsidiary loan to&#13;
AdM is assumed to respond to changes in the inflation rate. If interest rate increases are&#13;
above these projections, AdM's main risk will be associate with its difficulty in&#13;
transferring the incremental cost to consumers without a tariff increase, since this element&#13;
is not included as part of the updating formula. In the following table 10, changes for the&#13;
net income, net cash flow (aggregated until 2001 and 2006) and required government&#13;
support for the investment plan are presented for different variations of the projected&#13;
interest rate. As can be seen, since the interest will be capitalized during the construction&#13;
period, the impact of increases in the interest rate will be mainly felt on the cash flow and&#13;
income after project completion and on the ability of AdM to repay the loan to the&#13;
national government. This risk will be minimized through intensive and close supervision&#13;
and the expected continued political commitment and support for the sustainability of the&#13;
company and the project objectives, and through these to the adoption of tariff increases&#13;
when these are necessary to counteract exceptional circumstances that are external to&#13;
AdM's management capacity.&#13;

34.   Unaccounted-for-Water Risk. AdM's risk of the failure to achieve the reduction&#13;
targets established for the unaccounted-for-water are associated to reduced revenues and&#13;
increased operation costs that can not be transferred to the consumers through tariff&#13;
updates. In the following table II the impact on the net income, net cash flow and&#13;
required government support are presented for different reductions of unaccounted-for-&#13;
water against the projected targets for the year 2000.  The risks associated to reduced&#13;
targets for unaccounted-for-water will be minimized through the involvement of a private&#13;
operator with proved experience in this field and the adoption of an investment program&#13;
that will concentrate on rehabilitation and on metering.&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
WATER AND SEWERAGE DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
IN THE STATE OF MONAGAS&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
A. Summary&#13;
1.    Without the proposed project, it can be expected that the distribution network in Monagas will&#13;
continue to deteriorate, current shortages will become more severe and losses will continue to increase&#13;
due to lack of maintenance. With the project, a gradual improvement is expected, generating benefits&#13;
through the rehabilitation of the distribution network, better operational and financial management and&#13;
reduction of losses from waste, excessive consumption and the system's disrepair. The economic&#13;
benefits of the project will be derived from (i) the reallocation of water among users and (ii) the&#13;
reduction of physical losses. In order to measure the impact of reallocation, it is assumed that a&#13;
gradual shift from areas with unlimited consumption to shortage areas will take place in the next 5&#13;
years as a result of the proposed project. This shift will reallocate as much as 10% (5.5 Mm3 per year)&#13;
of maximum demand from a "market" which consumes excessive amounts at almost zero price, toward&#13;
a "market" which currently has permanent shortages due to low pressures or distribution problems&#13;
(deteriorated pipes, non-working valves, in-house leaks, etc.) and where water has a higher economic&#13;
value (as detected by the high willingness-to-pay of the population). This reallocation will result in net&#13;
gains with a Net Present Value of US$ 10.2 million'. Physical losses are estimated now at about 20&#13;
Mm3 per year or nearly one-third of production. The impact of system repairs and operation&#13;
improvements on the reduction of losses was estinated assuming that in the next five years, these&#13;
losses are reduced by 50%, that is, 10 Mm3 are recovered yearly by the year 2000 and that such&#13;
volume will be available to areas with current deficits and to new consumers. The Net Present Value&#13;
of the recovery of physical losses is calculated at US$ 20.5 million, resulting in a total benefit with a&#13;
Net Present Value of about US$ 30.7 million. The evaluation of benefits and costs of reallocation of&#13;
water among users and reduction of losses, based on the existing residential reference tariff rate of Bs&#13;
60 per cubic meter  results in an economic rate of return of about 15.2% for the rehabilitation&#13;
investments (65% of project costs). Taking into account consumer surplus, the rate of return is 27%.&#13;
2.    Additional justification for this project can be provided by the expected impacts at: (a) the&#13;
macroeconomic level, where the reduction of public transfers will positively impact the fiscal deficit&#13;
without reducing the level of service, as AdM assumes service responsibility and water tariffs are&#13;
rationalized. Savings could eventually reach more than US$ 200 million annually in IDROVENs&#13;
budget if this approach is expanded nationwide; and (b) the sector level, where the proposed project&#13;
will have an important impact not only on promoting a rational structure to administer water supply&#13;
systems throughout the country, but will also contribute to the performance of other sectors such as&#13;
public health. In the Monagas region, deficient water and sewerage service is regarded as a "public&#13;
In this case, there is a zero net transfer in terms of water volumes. Gains are discounted at 12% over a 20&#13;
year. As there are no estimates of the marginal cost of capital to use as the discount rate, 12% is used as&#13;
point of reference.&#13;
&#13;

health problem" by local health authorities, which estimate that 42,000 cases of water-related illnesses&#13;
(with a public health cost calculated at US$ 2.4 million annually) can be prevented by improved water&#13;
and sanitation services. Concomitant losses in productivity as a result of absences from work due to&#13;
illness have been estimated to amount to 56,000 work days per year, at an average additional cost of&#13;
about US$ 0.6 million per year&#13;
3.    Alternatives. The project design was selected over other alternatives which would have&#13;
attempted reform of the sector more rapidly and broadly, because the government of Venezuela&#13;
wants to test innovative approaches on a small scale, and because state and local authorities in&#13;
Monagas are highly motivated to improve the water utility's performance. Engineering designs&#13;
are based on least-cost options. The criteria used for the selection of the rehabilitation works and&#13;
their packaging is described in annex F.&#13;
B. Background&#13;
4.     The state of Monagas has a population of about 540,000. Piped water coverage is over 900/o.&#13;
Water production statistics indicate that 64 million m3 of potable water were produced in 1994,2&#13;
sufficient to provide over 300 liters to each person daily.3 In some residential areas of Maturin, the&#13;
state capital, normal consumption is over 500 liters per capita daily. Yet, during the dry season&#13;
(September to May), water scarcity is severe. In the 1994-95 dry season, some areas of the city had no&#13;
water 70% of the time; many people in urban areas had to walk long distances to obtain small amounts&#13;
from other parts of the city where there is an abundant supply even in the dry season; and many&#13;
residents in areas connected to the network had to go to the river to wash their clothes. Water quality&#13;
is deficient; excessive counts of coliforms have been found in the water supply, and the incidence of&#13;
water-related diseases treated at local hospitals is quite large.&#13;
5.    The system is so poorly run that unaccounted-for-water is estimated at 70%, although, it is not&#13;
clear how much water is actually produced, and billing has little to do with consumption. It has been&#13;
estimated that, in some years, as little as 14 million m3 of the estimated 64 million m3 produced are&#13;
billed. Only a few water meters are read and revenues cover only 25% of operation and maintenance&#13;
costs. The system has been heavily subsidized by the central government.&#13;
Supply&#13;
6.    Potable water to the municipalities of the state of Monagas is supplied by a combination of&#13;
surface and ground water systems. The main systems are the Amana-Maturin and Guarapiche which&#13;
supply water to the city of Maturin. The rest are small surface intakes and deep wells. A summary of&#13;
the total available supply of potable water is presented in Table I below.4 There is no information&#13;
This is after losses in transmission mains estimated at 20 million m3. Reported production was&#13;
approximately 90 million m3.&#13;
1000 liters per day for a family of 5, or 200 liters per person-day, is considered sufficient to meet basic&#13;
requirements.&#13;

a      Includes the Parish of Jusepin which has a small independent system.&#13;
b      This capacity would only be available if a reservoir is built at the Amana-Maturin&#13;
intake; the treatment plant, however, has a capacity of 4,000 1/s.&#13;
7.     Capacity. The system has considerable installed capacity in some processes but it is short in&#13;
others. The Mundo Nuevo water treatment plant (at the intake of the main Amana-Maturin system)&#13;
has a capacity of 4 m3/s but it has never produced at higher than 1.5 m3/s and, in the dry season, it&#13;
operates at close to 0.5 m3/s. The lack of a reservoir. (planned but never built) and the growing demand&#13;
for irrigation upstream from the plant does not allow for more than 0.5 m3/s as input to the Amana-&#13;
Maturin system during the five dry months of each year. Moreover, close to 60,000 people who live&#13;
along the 115 km transmission line betWeen the treatment plant and Maturin use water from this line.&#13;
8.     Table I shows installed capacity by municipality. Except for the Amana-Maturin system which&#13;
would require considerable investments to make its treatment plant capacity available, there is sufficient&#13;
capacity in most systems for the medium term. Even during the dry season a minimum of 1,100 I/s are&#13;
available for the city of Maturin, while demand (at 200 lpd) is only 747 I/s. Lack of adequate planning&#13;

could be a main obstacle to guarantee water supply from the current systems,5 but expansion will be&#13;
facilitated by underutilized processes.&#13;
9.     Production. There are no reliable production data for the system. Estimates range from 34 to&#13;
62 million m3 (Mm3) per year for Maturin, and from  51 to 94 Mm' for the State of Monagas.&#13;
According to Table 1, production in 1994 was approximately 90 Mm3. These estimates are based on&#13;
capacity ratings and operating penrods rather than on actual volumes produced. There is no macro-&#13;
metering operating in any of the systems. If figures on table I are reliable, there seems to be sufficient&#13;
water in most systems. The main problem could be storage capacity to resolve seasonal variations in&#13;
surface water systems. Only three municipalities (Piar, Cedeilo and Caripe) may have to expand&#13;
production in the short term.&#13;
10.    Distribution. Aguas de Monagas reports approximately 45,000 customers connected to the&#13;
water supply network, of which 42,000 are residential consumers. Since coverage is over 93% state-&#13;
wide, the number of persons per connection is nearly 13. This is relatively high and it may indicate that&#13;
a number of connections are not registered.&#13;
11.    According to various studies,6 the distribution network needs considerable improvement and it&#13;
may be the source of substantial losses. The main problems in distribution are: poor separation of&#13;
pressure zones, lack of consumption metering, and deterioration of pipe capacity in the network. The&#13;
commercial system (metering, meter reading, billing, collection, claims, and new service installation)&#13;
needs a complete overhaul.&#13;
12.    These problems are responsible for the deficient distribution of water, especially in Maturin,&#13;
where some areas experience severe shortages even when there is sufficient production while others&#13;
can consume seemingly unlimited quantities. It has been estimated that as many as 120,000 people are&#13;
affected by severe shortages (70% of the time) during the 5-month dry season.&#13;
13.    Unaccounted For Water (UFW). Since there are no reliable estimates of production, it is&#13;
impossible to estimate UFW with any degree of accuracy. For example, according to March figures,&#13;
annual billing for 1995 could be nearly 25 Mm3. This is between 27%  and 49%  of production&#13;
(depending on the range of production estimates mentioned above). Therefore, UFW could be&#13;
anywhere between 51% and 73%.&#13;
14.    Physical losses have been estimated at 20 Mrn3 per year.7 Billing, therefore, would be between&#13;
6 and 49 Mm3 short, a considerable loss of revenue for a highly subsidized system. As shown in Table&#13;
For example, unless an expansion of storage capacity at the Amana-Maturin intake is planned, the city&#13;
should not rely on this system which is delivering decreasing volumes as the city competes for the same&#13;
supply with other municipalities along the 114 km transmission line.&#13;
A recent diagnosis of the network was made in Tudor Engineering Co. and OBHIDRAConsult C.A.,&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
2 below, less than 25% of costs are covered by revenues collected. There is much work to be done on&#13;
this problem some of which is included in the proposed project.&#13;
15.   Sewerage. Sewerage services should be treated as part of water supply services under a&#13;
modem concept of integrated water management, since all consumers must dispose of used water&#13;
whether they are connected to the sewerage network or not. In fact, economic costs may be higher if&#13;
they are not connected.&#13;
16.    Sewerage service coverage in Monagas is much lower than water supply coverage. However,&#13;
because of the area's topography and tropical climate, drainage is a main problem and untreated sewage&#13;
is often found in flood waters which become stagnant and are breeding grounds for disease-carrying&#13;
insects. Due to leaks in the distribution network, drinking water can also become contaminated.&#13;
17.   Supply costs. The water supply system in Monagas is relatively inexpensive. Table 2 shows&#13;
its cost structure for altemative estimates of production and for its current level of billing. Even at this&#13;
low level of billing (25 out of 64 Mm3), cost per m3 is only Bs 31 (US$ 0.18). This is due to its low&#13;
energy costs (the main system is powered by gravity) and, possibly, because the system's operations are&#13;
under-budgeted. For example, the use of chemicals is low - which results in poor water quality.&#13;
Moreover, commercial costs are low since many of the costs associated with meter reading, billing,&#13;
collections, suspensions, etc. are not applicable; in four of the 10 municipalities there is no billing.&#13;
Table 2 shows actual costs for 1994 for the combined operations of Monagas water supply.&#13;
18.   Although depreciation may be underestimated probably due to a low evaluation of fixed assets,&#13;
Table 2 shows that cost per m3 (Bs 31) is less that the new average tariff of Bs 36 per m3. This implies&#13;
that an increase in billing would generate net revenues which could help finance important rehabilitation&#13;
requirements including the commercial system itself. It must be noted that maintenance costs are&#13;
relatively high, yet maintenance is deficient. This is due to deficiencies in the supervision of&#13;
maintenance contracts. Such problems could be resolved by the new institutional arrangements.&#13;
19.   Total costs are not expected to decline under the new organization; however, average costs&#13;
should decrease significantly as water losses decline. For example, most probably, actual consumption&#13;
is at nearly 51 Mm3 which, according to Table 2, would have a cost of Bs 15.2 per m3. Cutting water&#13;
losses by 20% will increase available production to 64 Mm3 and average cost will fall to Bs 12.1 per&#13;
m3. The last column of Table 2 shows average cost per m3 actually billed; even at this low level of&#13;
billing, cost per m3 is only Bs 31.&#13;

C. Economic impact of the Proposed Project&#13;
20.    The main impact of the proposed project is the improvement in overall service quality and&#13;
distribution. The main real implication of the deficiency of the current system is the fact that in some&#13;
areas water is abundant and used carelessly while in other areas there are substantial shortages, even&#13;
during the rainy season when there is sufficient flow in the Amana-Maturin system, in spite of the high&#13;
demand and economic value attributed by the users to the service, as measured in the willingness-to-&#13;
pay studies carried out (see annex D for details). The economic rationale for this project is based on&#13;
achieving two simple objectives: (a) establishing market, organizational and incentive structures that&#13;
are more likely than the present ones to generate economically efficient results; and, (b) rehabilitating&#13;
the physical system to ensure that water is treated and supplied in an efficient manner, reducing losses.&#13;
If properly executed, the project should be highly productive: water consumption ranges from less than&#13;
70 liters per person-day (Ipd) in some areas and over 400 lpd in others; the observed marginal value of&#13;
water could be as high as Bs 1000 per m3; and water losses represent roughly 20 million m3 per year.&#13;
Therefore, the proposed project will generate important benefits in terms of improved water&#13;
distribution, reduction in water losses, rationalization of consumption, and overall economic efficiency.&#13;
21.     Cost-benefit analysis.  Economic efficiency gains may be measured by comparing the&#13;
outcomes of the system under the current and proposed organizational structures; and, given the new&#13;
structure, the additional (marginal) impact of the proposed investments is measured by the improved&#13;
availability and quality of service. It must be noted that the two levels are not independent. The best&#13;
management structure could not do much to improve water delivery, at present, without some&#13;
rehabilitation of the network and facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Page 7 of 14&#13;
22.   The economic evaluation of this project is directed at comparing the economic efficiency of the&#13;
current and proposed structures for operating the water supply system for the state of Monagas. On&#13;
the benefits side, this includes a comparison of the current cost structure with that which is likely to be&#13;
effective under the proposed management arrangement, as well as the effect of better service and&#13;
improved distribution of the current supply. The cost includes all investments necessary to normnalize&#13;
the system; that is, all works and procedures that would ensure adequate distribution of current&#13;
production including adequate application of the price (tariff) system.&#13;
23.   It also includes the costs of all that is related to the future operation of the system or the&#13;
rehabilitation of intake structures, treatment plants, transmission mains, and the sewerage network&#13;
including wastewater treatment plants. These investments will ensure the reliability of future supplies&#13;
to meet growing demand for water. Benefits are given by the value of additional demand satisfied (the&#13;
value of increase in quality and extemal effects, such as those on health, have not been valued to remain&#13;
in the safe side of the analysis).&#13;
Demand&#13;
24.   Consumption. As indicated, water consumption is low in areas where pressures are too low&#13;
or pipes have lost most of their capacity because of age or leaks or both8; and it is high in other areas.&#13;
There is no reliable data on consumption since billing is based on a flat rate which, only formally, is&#13;
related to a rate per m3 and an assigned monthly volume per household. However, estimates of water&#13;
production (51 to 94 Mm3 per year) and estimated physical losses (20 Mm3 per year) indicate that&#13;
actual consumption could be between 31 and 74 Mm3 which is between 151 and 459 lpd. Most&#13;
probably, consumption is between 50 and 55 Mm3 per year, or as much as 270 lpd. However, a main&#13;
characteristic of the current system is its poor distribution, with some areas consuming over 1,000 lpd&#13;
and others less that 70 lpd. Non-residential consumption is only 16% of total consumption, according&#13;
to billing figures.&#13;
25.   Characterization of the demand function. With available information, it is not possible to&#13;
estimate the demand function in a conventional manner. However, several aspects are known about&#13;
consumer behavior in the system which allows for an approximation of the demand curve, or at least of&#13;
its boundaries.&#13;
8      Due to inadequate chlorination, a considerable build-up of bacteria-produced iron compounds are&#13;
reducing pipe sections to as little as 15% of its original size.&#13;

26.    For example, it is known that consumers pay as much as the equivalent of Bs 1000 per m3 for&#13;
water delivered by truck in 200 liter barrels. This is the rate charged by private operators. The&#13;
municipalities have their own trucks to provide this service, although they do not charge a fee. In the&#13;
recent dry season, a similar rate was paid in some areas of Maturin by consumers in shortage areas to&#13;
other residential and commercial consumers. This price applies both to small quantities in areas where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
consumers are not connected to the network as well as to marginal quantities used to supplement&#13;
limited supplies from the network.&#13;
27.   Results of a contingent valuation survey indicate that consumers are willing to pay much higher&#13;
rates than they are now paying for a reliable water service. According to these results, 91% of&#13;
consumers favor a reliable system at a tariff of Bs 2,000 per month, and 78% favor the system at a&#13;
tariff of Bs 4,000. The first figure is equivalent to a price of Bs 50 per m3 for a consumption of 40 m3&#13;
per month. These figures are consistent with responses in situations in which service is inexpensive but&#13;
deficient, and they are certainly affordable. The new residential rate is Bs 1865 per month per&#13;
connection, or Bs 60 per m3, and Bs 800 per month per connection or Bs 20 per m3, on average, for&#13;
the social group.&#13;
28.   Currently, prices are low (marginal price is zero) and the corresponding quantity demanded is&#13;
either constrained by the state of the distribution network in some areas or as much as customers can&#13;
consume in others.&#13;
29.   Total demand may be as much as 55 million n3 at a zero marginal price. This is obtained from&#13;
42,000 connections, 12 persons per connection, and 300 liters/day. At these levels, demand is highly&#13;
inelastic and behaves differently from a conventional demand function. Only a significant increase in&#13;
prices would reveal regular demand responses. This could take place immediately when meters are&#13;
installed and a per m3 rate is applied. At present, for example, consumers do not have any incentives to&#13;
make the most simple repairs to reduce water leaks at home.&#13;
30.   From the above facts, the demand function should be approximately as shown in Table 3 and&#13;
Figure 1. Quantities demanded, shown in Table 3 are determined by the following equation: Q = 55.0 -&#13;
0.055 P, a simple straight line function where 55.0 Mm3 is the assumed maximum volume of domestic&#13;
consumption at current prices (zero marginal price) and supply restrictions for some consumers. The&#13;
slope (-0.055) is determined by the relation between maximum consumption and maximum&#13;
"willingness to pay" (Bs 1000 per mi3) as stated above. Results from the contingent valuation survey&#13;
consistently fit in this range.&#13;
31.   If it is assumed that consumers pay a maximum of 5% of their income on water service, then&#13;
Table 3 (income-constrained consumption) shows, at different prices, the amounts that a household&#13;
with a total income of two minimum salaries could get. It must be noted that only at prices above Bs&#13;
300 per m3, a household could only get below 100 lpd. However, as mentioned before, some&#13;
consumers already pay the equivalent of Bs 1,000 per m3 for small quantities.&#13;
Impact of the proposed project&#13;
32.   Current and expected situation without the project. Without the proposed project, it is&#13;
expected that the distribution network will continue to deteriorate, current shortages will become more&#13;
severe and losses will continue to increase due to lack of maintenance. In areas where there is sufficient&#13;
supply, there will be no rationalization of consumption as long as adequate pricing or rationing.are not&#13;
implemented. Total costs may remain constant but average costs will increase due to a reduction in&#13;
production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Page 10 of 14&#13;
33.   Expected situation with the project. With the project, a gradual improvement is expected.&#13;
The main benefits will be generated when it becomes possible, through improvement of the distribution&#13;
network and better operational and financial management, to reduce losses from waste and excessive&#13;
consumption in some areas and allocate them in shortage areas. Total variable costs may increase due&#13;
to improvements in production and commercial processes but average costs may decline due to&#13;
increases in production.&#13;
34.   In order to measure this impact, it is assumed that a gradual shift from areas with unlimited&#13;
consumption to shortage areas, will take place in the next 5 years as a result of the proposed project.&#13;
This shift will reallocate as much as 10% (5.5 Mm' per year)9 of maximum demand from areas with&#13;
excessive consumption.&#13;
35.   This measurement is illustrated in Figure I using the estimates of Table 3. Consumption will be&#13;
decreased through price or non-price means (rationing, better controls) from a "market" which&#13;
consumes excessive amounts at zero price. This volume will be shifted toward a "market" which&#13;
currently has permanent shortages due to low pressures or distribution problems (deteriorated pipes,&#13;
non-working valves, in-house leaks, etc.) and where water has a higher economic value. In this case,&#13;
there is a zero net transfer in terms of water volumes. 10&#13;
36.   In the market with excess consumption, the water is valued at between zero and Bs 60 per m3.&#13;
In the market with shortages, this water could be valued anywhere between Bs 100 and 1000 per m3,&#13;
depending on the location where service would be improved. Since for the system as a whole, water is&#13;
not scarce even during the dry season, new customers and households that purchase water to&#13;
supplement their insufficient piped supplies will benefit the most since they normally pay the barrel&#13;
price of Bs 1000 per m3. Other households, with restricted supplies, who normally would not purchase&#13;
additional water, would benefit the least depending on the level of their supplies. In any case all&#13;
households vvith restricted supplies are likely to benefit from an improved distribution network and&#13;
operation.&#13;
37.   Therefore, there is a substantial net gain from this reallocation. As seen from Figure 1, the loss&#13;
- in terms of consumer surplus - to the first group is offset by a gain in the same amount to the second&#13;
group, while there is a net value of 5.5 Mm3 at Bs 100 per m3 to the second group. This is a&#13;
conservative estimate since, the distribution of consumption is likely to eliminate shortages in the dry&#13;
months. Therefore the gain in consumer surplus will be much larger than the estimated here, since here&#13;
the shift in consumption is assumed to be at the next inframarginal level. That is in Figure 1 the shift&#13;
should be from consumption at the right hand of the demand function, to consumption near the left&#13;
hand side of the demand function where the consumer surplus is much larger.&#13;
9     This volume could provide the 120,000 people in Maturin affected by severe shortages an additional 20&#13;
m3 per household per month. Assuming 6 persons per household, this is equivalent to 4.8 million m3 per&#13;
year.&#13;
I 0   There could be a net gain if some of the transfer is from physical losses.&#13;

38.   The value of this net gain is US$ 3.24 nillion per year (5.5 Mmr3 x 100 Bs/m3). If it is further&#13;
assumed that in 1997 only 20% of this effect will take place, 40% in 1998, 60% in 1999, 80% in 2000,&#13;
and 100% thereafter, net gains per year are shown in Table 4. These gains are discounted at 12%"&#13;
over a 20 year period to yield a Present Value of about US$ 16.94 million.&#13;
39.    Another important effect that should take place as the system is repaired and its operation&#13;
improved is the recovery of physical losses, estimated now at 20 Mm3 per year or nearly one-third of&#13;
production. If in the next five years, these loses are reduced by 50%, that is, 10 Mnm3 are recovered by&#13;
the year 2001 - a feasible goal - such volume will be available to areas with current deficits and to new&#13;
consumers. The value of this additional supply, assuming a constant value of Bs 60 per m3 is US$ 3.53&#13;
million per year (a net present value of US$ 205 million in 20 years; see Table 4). This level is reached&#13;
gradually by the year 2001 and increases thereafter with population growth (assumed at 2.5% per&#13;
year).&#13;
There are no estimates of the marginal cost of capital to use as the discount rate; 12% is used as point of&#13;
reference.&#13;

40.    Project costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 71 million. If taxes, price&#13;
escalation and interest charges are subtracted the project's economic cost is US$ 54.35 million, with a&#13;
net present value of US$ 38.05 million, while the cost of the rehabilitation investments over the project&#13;
execution period is US$ 36.5 rillion (65% of total costs, with a net present value of US$ 25.62&#13;
million), distributed as shown in Table 4. No shadow valuation or other adjustments of financial costs&#13;
were deemed necessary.&#13;
41.    Evaluating benefits at present tariff level (residential rate Bs 60/m3), the economic rate of return&#13;
of the project's rehabilitation investments (as said above, about 65% of project costs) is 15.2%. If&#13;
consumer surpluses, based on a marginal social value of Bs 100/mi3, are also taken into account in the&#13;
calculation, the rate of return rises to 27%. The main contributor to project benefits is the reduction in&#13;
physical losses. A significant number of consumers are willing to pay as much as Bs 1000 per m3, and&#13;
the results of the contingent valuation study show that 91% of consumers are willing to pay Bs 50 per&#13;
m3 for an adequate supply while 78% would pay Bs 100 for the same volume.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Sensitivity analysis&#13;
42.    The most critical parameters in the calculation of the project's net benefits are the marginal&#13;
value of water, the volume of water which can be recovered and the amount that can be redistributed.&#13;
The above estimates may be considered a conservative scenario, since the value of water (Bs 60 per&#13;
mi) is the current price; the 5.5 Mm' per year redistributed is only 10% of most probable consumption,&#13;
and the 10 Mm3 of physical losses recovered to be reached in 5 years is only 10% of production and&#13;
50% of estimated physical losses. This goals should be easily achieved if the project is properly&#13;
executed.&#13;
43.    If the price of water is increased to Bs 150 per M3, the IRR of the project increases to 42%&#13;
However, if losses are reduced by only 5 Mm3 per year, the IRR for the project falls to 8.5% and is nil&#13;
if no physical losses are recovered. Other things equal, water recovery should be no less than 7.5 Mm3&#13;
per year in order for the IRR of the rehabilitation investments not to fall below 12%. Similarly, if&#13;
investment costs increase by 50%, the IRR would fall to 8.5% (as most of project's investment costs&#13;
are going to be local and tariffs will be adjusted in relation to the cost of the service, the sensitivity of&#13;
the analysis to exchange rate changes is low).&#13;
E. Additional Rationale for Project Justification&#13;
44     The proposed project has important impacts beyond its direct economic benefits. it provides&#13;
the opportunity to demonstrate the gains, generated at various levels, of a decentralized water supply&#13;
sector and contributes to the performance of other sectors in the state of Monagas, as the health sector.&#13;
This project will be the first experience in Venezuela in the process of decentralizing the structure&#13;
controlled by the central govemment and managed by the regional agencies at considerable costs to the&#13;
central government and large economic losses in the supply of services to the population. The success&#13;
of the project will induce replications across the country, thus reducing government losses and&#13;
increasing quality and quantity of water supplies. At the macroeconomic level, there will be clear gains&#13;
in the reduction of public expenditures to cover the HIDROs deficits without reducing the level of&#13;
service. There will be, in fact, a shift from deficit financing to revenue generation as water tariffs are&#13;
rationalized, and the service itself is improved. At the sector level, the proposed project will have an&#13;
important impact not only on promoting a rational structure to administer water supply systems&#13;
throughout the country, but it will also contribute to the performance of other sectors such as public&#13;
health. As shown below, the deficient water and sewerage service is being regarded as a "public health&#13;
problem" in the Monagas region. These further benefits are not being accounted here, when assessing&#13;
the rate of retum. Thus the evaluated rate of return here assessed is a lower bound of the real rate of&#13;
return, since those benefits are also derived from this project.&#13;
45     Macroeconomic effects.  The central govemment subsidizes the water sector directly&#13;
through HIDROVEN's budget and indirectly through arrears with electricity and other suppliers. It is&#13;
estimated that only 40% of the water sector's operating costs are recovered through tariffs This figure&#13;
is only 25% for the State of Monagas. This transfer is estimated at between US$ 100 and 150 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

annually, in constant terms, which is part of the public sector's operating deficit.12 Although, this is&#13;
relatively small compared to the public sector's operating deficit of nearly US$ 4.0 billion in 1994, it is&#13;
an impoitant contributor to any deficit reduction strategy because it does not require a reduction in&#13;
services, in fact, it is expected that service will improve under a decentralized, self-financed system.&#13;
46.    The central govemment could also make substantial savings in investment costs. According to&#13;
fIlDROVEN's investment budget for 1995, Bs 23,497 millions (US$ 138 million) will be spent in&#13;
water and sanitation infrastructure. However, from the State of Monagas projections, the system could&#13;
repay its investments from its own tariff income.&#13;
47.    Health sector impact. An improvement in the performance of the water and sewerage sector&#13;
will have a significant impact on the health sector. According to the Regional Directorate of Health for&#13;
the state of Monagas, water is considered a "health problem" in the state. Increases in the incidence of&#13;
water-borne diseases have been reported by all health districts due to poor water quality which is&#13;
associated with deficient treatment which, in turn, is associated with lack of an adequate budget for&#13;
operations.&#13;
48.    The analysis of the value of water did not include the health impact of potable water. This&#13;
conservative approach was used since in this case there are public health benefits which are not&#13;
captured by this parameter because, among other reasons, most health services are free in the state of&#13;
Monagas. That is, consumers do not consider, in the price of water, any benefits from savings in health&#13;
costs which they do not pay. However, local health authorities assumed that 15% of the population&#13;
are affected annually by water-caused health problems, and that about one-half of these cases (42,000)&#13;
can be prevented by improved water and sanitation services and, further, that each case costs the health&#13;
system Bs 10,0003 . Based on these assumptions, it can be estimated that the annual savings which&#13;
could be achieved through this project would be around Bs 420 million, or approximately US$ 2.4&#13;
million. In addition, losses in productivity as a result of absences from work due to illness amount to&#13;
56,000 work days per year, at a cost of about Bs 100.8 million per year (US$ 0.576 million per year)14&#13;
Thus, the total impact resulting of improved availability of water and quality of service was estimated at&#13;
Bs 520.8 million (US$ 3.0 million) annually, which would be reached gradually as the project is&#13;
implemented.&#13;
12     It is estimated that in 1994, water and sewerage subsidies reached Bs 15,024 million which, at the average&#13;
cxchange rate for 1994 (150 Bs/US$), is equivalent to US$ 100 million. This is relatively low since it was&#13;
calculated using Bs 1,252 as operating cost per person (the average for the State of Monagas) and it does&#13;
not include areas with electricity suppliers.&#13;
13     This estimate is based on the average cost of one visit to the doctor and of prescription medicine. For most&#13;
people, in the State of Monagas, this is provided free by the public health system. This cost is, therefore,&#13;
the cost to the public sector.&#13;
This is estimated assuming an average monthly salary (productivity) of Bs 45,000, or Bs 1,800 per day,&#13;
and one-third of the affected population in the labor force and 2 days lost per occurrence on average.&#13;

            The principal objectives of the Water
            and Sewerage Decentralization Project in the State of
            Monagas is to increase the efficiency and quality of the
            water supply and sanitation (WS&amp;S) services in Venezuela
            through the development of a model for decentralization,
            institutional strengthening, and expanded private sector
            participation. The project has three specific objectives: 1)
            to assist in the strengthening of Monagas Water and Sewerage
            Company (AdM), develop its financial self-sufficiency, and
            involve the private sector in the management and operation
            of the company; 2) to rehabilitate and improve the quality
            of WS&amp;S services in Monagas; and 3) to support sector
            development and decentralization at the national level,
            including water resources management. The project will
            include two components to finance: 1) regional institutional
            strengthening and investment in rehabilitating the existing
            WS&amp;S systems in the State of Monagas to improve quality
            and efficiency of service delivery. This component will
            consist of: (a) institutional strengthening and support to
            AdM; (b) rehabilitation in urban areas; and (c)
            institutional development and rehabilitation of rural water
            systems; and 2) national institutional strengthening, which
            will include: (a) a technical assistance program; (b) a
            national training program; (c) a sector decentralization
            program; and (d) consulting services.
