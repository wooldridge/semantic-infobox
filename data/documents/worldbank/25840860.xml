&amp;#12;1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
1.1. Why GVCs matter&#13;
Once concentrated among a few large economies, global flows of goods, services, and capital now reach&#13;
an ever larger number of economies worldwide. Global trade in goods and services increased 10 times&#13;
between 1980 and 2011, while FDI flows increased almost 30-fold. The sales from foreign-owned firms&#13;
amount to $26 trillion. As many as 3,000 bilateral investment treaties have been signed to create the&#13;
framework of deep agreements needed not only to facilitate the global movement of final goods and&#13;
services but also to internationalize entire processes of production. All these flows have grown over time,&#13;
creating increasingly dense and complex networks.&#13;
&#13;
One of the most significant reasons behind this transformation in global trade and investment has been&#13;
the rise of global value chains (GVCs). Falling transport costs, greater global openness and cooperation&#13;
on trade policy, and the ICT revolution have allowed production processes to be increasingly unbundled&#13;
and shared across countries. Developing countries now join GVCs to further increase their economic&#13;
competitiveness and they industrialize by densifying their participation. This is a huge change from the&#13;
20th century when countries had to build entire supply chains domestically to become competitive&#13;
internationally (Baldwin 2006; see AntrÃ s and Rossi-Hansberg 2009 and Ahmad 2013 for an overview of&#13;
the literature).&#13;
&#13;
An implication of this is that GVCs denationalize comparative advantage, and this changes the options&#13;
facing developing and developed nations, participants and non-participants. Globally competitive â&#128;&#152;lead&#13;
firmsâ&#128;&#153; knit together national comparative advantages to build components in the most costâ&#128;&#144;effective&#13;
locations. Factories in developing nations have become full-fledged participants in international&#13;
manufacturing networks. These factories are no longer are merely importing parts for assembly, in order&#13;
to service domestic markets; rather, they are exporting parts and components used in some of the most&#13;
sophisticated products on the planet. In short, 20th century globalization was about made â&#128;&#144; here â&#128;&#144;&#13;
soldâ&#128;&#144;there goods crossing borders: the trade system helped those nations able to produce finished&#13;
goods domestically, sell products abroad. But 21st century globalization is also about factories crossing&#13;
borders, so intra-factory flows of goods, know-how, investment, training, ideas, and people are now&#13;
international commerce. The trade system now can help nations make things, not just sell things.&#13;
&#13;
1.2. Measuring GVC participation&#13;
In this context, understanding a countryâ&#128;&#153;s current participation in value chains is beneficial to ensuring&#13;
that its industrial and trade policies can facilitate sustainable productivity gains and increased quality&#13;
employment within higher value-added sectors. But examining trade participation and performance&#13;
through a GVC lens requires a revised way of measuring and analyzing cross-border and cross-industry&#13;
flows in goods and services. In particular competitiveness in specific components and tasks (rather than&#13;
comparative advantage in end products) is paramount, enabling participation within larger production&#13;
networks and, in turn, increased value addition generated domestically over time.&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, from a country perspective what matters ultimately is the value addition generated in the country&#13;
from its export activity, and whether it increases (nominally) over time. This is not a new question for&#13;
economics. Value addition is a function of productivity, but it is associated with the breadth, variety, and&#13;
sophistication of tasks and activities in which a country specializes. The concept of domestic value added&#13;
in exports is, therefore, an essential concept to understand the importance of GVC trade for a country.&#13;
This concept allows us to distinguish the foreign and domestic content of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports, at it also&#13;
                                                                                                          1&#13;
&amp;#12;accounts for the fact that some of the imported inputs may contain domestic value added that is&#13;
processed in a foreign location and reimported. This concept is explained in more detail in Appendix 1.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of value added trade is based on the use of input-output tables which, while sacrificing the&#13;
specificity of using customs classifications on parts or components, allow tracking usage explicitly at a&#13;
sectorally disaggregated level and differentiating between transactions that are intermediates and those&#13;
consumed as final demand by firms, governments, or consumers. This has been central to a recent&#13;
proliferation of studies examining the development of value added in production and trade, starting with&#13;
Hummels et al. (2001) and more recently elaborated by Koopman et al. (2010), Foster et al. (2011), and&#13;
Johnson and Noguera (2012), among others.2&#13;
&#13;
1.3. The relevance of GVCs for SACU countries&#13;
GVCs offer potential new opportunities for the five countries of the Southern African Customs Union&#13;
(SACU): Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. With global offshoring continuing to&#13;
grow and wages rising in China and elsewhere in East Asia, substantial migration of value chains to Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa is expected (Lin, 2011). The SACU region â&#128;&#147; with its abundance of natural capital and surplus&#13;
labor, along with a relatively high quality infrastructure and institutional environment â&#128;&#147; may be in a good&#13;
position to attract GVC-oriented investment. Beyond assembly manufacturing that is typical of GVCs (e.g.&#13;
apparel, electronics, automotive), the region should also be well-placed to compete as a location for&#13;
value-addition to agricultural and mineral commodities (â&#128;&#156;beneficiationâ&#128;&#157;). Both types of investment would&#13;
not only drive exports and have the potential to create significant employment, but also support&#13;
productivity upgrading by accessing global technologies and knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
While across the region there is significant interest in facilitating integration into GVCs as well deepening&#13;
integration of regional value chains (RVCs), there remains limited evidence of the extent of current&#13;
integration, either globally or regionally. The most systematic assessment to date comes in the African&#13;
Economic Outlook (AfDB 2014), which notes that the wider Southern Africa is currently leading the&#13;
continent in terms of GVC participation, accounting for 40% of Africaâ&#128;&#153;s combined backward and forward&#13;
integration, driven primarily by South Africa. In discussing the relevance of GVCs for the five SACU&#13;
countries individually, the aforementioned African Economic Outlook summarizes the main GVC-related&#13;
constraints and opportunities for each African country, including short profiles of the SACU countries (see&#13;
Box 1). Substantial analysis has also been carried out within the more qualitative GVC literature of&#13;
particular value chains in the SACU countries, including South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s automobile sector (c.f. Barnes and&#13;
Kaplinsky 2000; Black 2001; Barnes and Morris 2008) and horticulture industry (c.f. Barrientos and Visser&#13;
2012), and Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s and Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s apparel industries (c.f. Morris, Staritz and Banes 2011; Staritz and&#13;
Morris 2013). However, with the exception of South Africa, which is featured in the recently released&#13;
WIOD and OECD/WTO TiVA multi-region input-output databases, little empirical data on GVC&#13;
participation, positioning, and performance is available for the other SACU countries.&#13;
&#13;
    Box 1: African Economic Outlookâ&#128;&#153;s assessment of current and potential value chains for SACU countries&#13;
    Drawing on the African Economic Outlookâ&#128;&#153;s country notes (AfDB 2014), the regionâ&#128;&#153;s most recent trade policy&#13;
    review (WTO Secretariat 2009), as well as a cursory review of country strategy documents, the SACU countries&#13;
    have, when compared to other African countries, made greater inroads in terms of value chain integration.&#13;
&#13;
    Botswana has a relatively open economy, and has benefited substantially from its natural resource boon. The&#13;
    sectors in which Botswana is most engaged in global trade are mining, vehicles, textiles, beef and tourism, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2   A third approach lies in using customs data on processing trade (Gorg 2000, Swenson 2013, Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez 2013).&#13;
                                                                                                                             2&#13;
&amp;#12; diamonds to the US, Europe, and Japan as the largest export commodity. Currently its manufacturing exports are&#13;
 only growing slowly and have low domestic value added and high import content. Increasing value addition from&#13;
 mining (by, for example, carrying out more processing and manufacturing domestically) as well as the growing&#13;
 tourism sector are seen to have substantial potential.&#13;
&#13;
 The clothing, textile, and livestock value chains are of central importance for Lesotho. Clothing accounts for 60%&#13;
 of total exports and employs 80% of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing labor force, functioning as the largest employer&#13;
 outside of government. Currently, Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s clothing sector participates primarily within US -based buyer-driven&#13;
 GVCs but there is scope to expand further the recently growing market share in South Africa, given Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 geographical advantages over Chinese imports. Livestock is currently the largest contributor to agricultural value&#13;
 added and could be further developed as an export sector. This will, however, require overcoming significant&#13;
 challenges including poor nutrition and low quality products, weak market links, and limited access to financial&#13;
 services. For textiles, there are concerns about inadequate skills.&#13;
&#13;
 Despite recent efforts at diversification â&#128;&#147; particularly in the fish and meat processing and mineral industries â&#128;&#147;&#13;
 Namibia currently remains relatively minimally integrated into value chains. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s extraction and&#13;
 processing of minerals is the main growth driver but given its relative capital-intensity, it has only limited&#13;
 employment impacts. While constrained by skills shortages (especially at the mid-level) and regulatory obstacles,&#13;
 Namibiaâ&#128;&#153;s proximity to South Africa and its well-developed infrastructure offers potential to connect to regional&#13;
 and global supply chains. This has motivated the recent development of export-processing zones and the granting&#13;
 of special manufacturing incentives.&#13;
&#13;
 South Africa is unique on the continent for the scale of its participation (and in some cases leadership) within&#13;
 GVCs, including the automobile, mining, finance, and agriculture sectors. In manufacturing (and particularly&#13;
 automobiles) it serves as an assembly hub for Africa, and this industry accounts for more than 6% of GDP. Mining,&#13;
 which is predominantly locally owned, is even more significant, accounting for 19% of GDP while the sector has&#13;
 substantial spillovers into financial services and housing. The finance and retail industries also have substantial&#13;
 presences in other African countries. According to the AEO, South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s advantages pertain particularly to skills,&#13;
 research capacities, as well as well-developed and dense networks of local supply industries and services.&#13;
&#13;
 Despite Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s declining attractiveness to foreign investors (following the investment boom of the 1990s),&#13;
 the role of GVCs remains significant and investment stock remains high considering the size of the economy. Its&#13;
 main exports include sugar and sugar products, forestry, processed fruit, textiles, soft drinks, and some diverse&#13;
 manufactures. Value addition is hampered by the only limited stages of production that the country engages in&#13;
 and, in turn, a heavy reliance on South Africa for goods and services inputs.&#13;

1.4. Objectives and structure of this note&#13;
This note is intended provide an overview of SACU countriesâ&#128;&#153; participation and performance in GVCs,&#13;
drawing on several data sources and indicators, and most importantly the recently released 189-country&#13;
Eora multi-region-input-output (MRIO) database (Lenzen et al. 2012, 2013). Following this introduction,&#13;
the note is structured in five additional sections. Section 2 discusses in greater detail the scope of the&#13;
report, including the data sources and methodological approaches, as well as their respective limitations.&#13;
Section 3 looks at structural integration in trade, including the degree to which SACU countries import&#13;
and export intermediates. Section 4 analyzes trends in value-added exports as a first step in exploring&#13;
GVC participation. Section 5 hones in on the core measures of GVC participation and a brief analysis of&#13;
SACU countriesâ&#128;&#153; position in GVCs. Finally, Section 6 concludes by bringing together the main findings from&#13;
the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                         3&#13;
&amp;#12;2. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
2.1. Data sources and background to the Eora database&#13;
This note makes use of several data sources to carry out the analysis. Aggregate trade data and data on&#13;
trade in intermediates (Section 3) comes from UN Comtrade, as does the analysis of upstreamness&#13;
(Section 5). In addition, the note draws on indicators of domestic value added embodied in gross exports&#13;
based on the Francois et al. (2013) database3. The most important data source for the analysis of GVCs,&#13;
however, is the Eora database â&#128;&#147; this is discussed in more detail below.&#13;
&#13;
The simplified Eora database is disaggregated into 189 countries and 26 sectors per country (including a&#13;
â&#128;&#152;rest of worldâ&#128;&#153; sector that captures statistical discrepancies)4. It is thus the only MRIO database that has&#13;
relatively comprehensive coverage for sub-Saharan Africa. This makes it well suited for longitudinal&#13;
analysis of value chain integration of developing countries not included in other datasets. 5 The Eora&#13;
database, much like the OECD/WTOâ&#128;&#153;s TiVA database, uses available information to produce measures of&#13;
trade in value-added for all countries. In order to produce a contiguous and continuous dataset, values&#13;
has been interpolated for countries lacking necessary data. Eora has a historical time series spanning&#13;
1990-2011 based on an iterative process using an initial year estimate for 2000, overlaying estimates for&#13;
1999 and 2001, respectively with new data, and then re-balancing. In the past year, some analysis derived&#13;
from the Eora database has been published in the African Economic Outlook (AfDB 2014) and the World&#13;
Investment Report (UNCTAD 2013).&#13;
&#13;
As such, the Eora dataset allows for an approximate replication, albeit at a somewhat lower level of&#13;
precision, of the kind of analysis undertaken for other countries using the WIOD or TiVA databases.&#13;
Appendix 1 provides a more detailed discussion of the development of different MRIOs, and Eora&#13;
specifically. In terms of key indicators, this report draws on the methodologies first developed by&#13;
Hummels, Ishii, and Yi (2001) in measuring vertical specialization and in turn formalized by Koopman,&#13;
Powers, Wang, and Wei (2011) (and later Koopman, Wang, and Wei 2014) to derive some of the most&#13;
commonly used trade-in-value-added indicators, including domestic and foreign value-added, as well as&#13;
value added embodied in other countryâ&#128;&#153;s intermediate inputs â&#128;&#147; i.e. forward and backward integration&#13;
(see Appendix 2). Thus far most of these indicators have only been available publically for developed and&#13;
other emerging economies through the WTO-OECD TiVA database and the WIOD database (both released&#13;
in 2013).&#13;
&#13;
2.2. Scope of coverage: geographical and sectoral&#13;
In order to provide a meaningful context for comparative analysis with the five SACU countries, 14 â&#128;&#152;peer&#13;
countriesâ&#128;&#153; in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America have been selected. For each of the five&#13;
SACU countries, decomposed value-added measures (using f.o.b. prices, in current USD) are provided&#13;
over 11 years (2000, 2006, and 2011) and placed next to peer countries in order to provide a relevant&#13;
context for these countriesâ&#128;&#153; GVC integration. The peers include:&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
   Backward linkages in the Francois et al. (2013) database serve as a reasonable proxy for the domestic value added embodied&#13;
in exports, as the share of re-imported intermediates is generally negligible. This analysis draws on input-output data available&#13;
from the GTAP dataset.&#13;
4 This is the condensed version of Eora with countries that have more than 26 sectors in their input-output or supply-use tables&#13;
&#13;
having their accounts simplified. However, this does not apply to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, which all have just&#13;
26 sectors even in the expanded Eora database.&#13;
5 In comparative analysis with the WIOD dataset, Eora was found to provide broadly similar results when calculating foreign and&#13;
&#13;
domestic value added, albeit with a slight upward bias (which is to be expected as the greater number of highly heterogeneous&#13;
developing countries, many of which have been subsumed in WIODâ&#128;&#153;s rest of world matrix) (UNCTAD 2013).&#13;
                                                                                                                               4&#13;
&amp;#12;       ï&#130;§    Southern African Development Community (SADC) neighbors with resource-rich economies:&#13;
            Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia&#13;
       ï&#130;§    Other African countries that have been reasonably successful at integrating into GVCs: Kenya,&#13;
            Mauritius, and Rwanda.&#13;
       ï&#130;§    A selection of Asian and South American low- and middle-income countries with economic and/or&#13;
            geographical structures that are similar to one or more SACU country: Argentina, Bolivia,&#13;
            Cambodia, Chile, Lao PDR, Paraguay, Peru, and Thailand.&#13;
&#13;
Key sectors for each country are also analyzed. Here selection drew on whether the relevant sector was&#13;
tradable, as well as how significant they were as export sectors (an overview of this is provided in Section&#13;
3.1 and Appendix 3). Based on Eoraâ&#128;&#153;s 26-sector classification system6, the following fourteen sectors were&#13;
selected for closer consideration for each of the SACU countries:&#13;
    1. Agriculture&#13;
    2. Fishing&#13;
    3. Electrical and machinery&#13;
    4. Financial intermediation and business services&#13;
    5. Food and beverages&#13;
    6. Hotels and restaurants&#13;
    7. Metal products&#13;
    8. Other manufacturing&#13;
    9. Petroleum, chemicals, and non-metallic minerals&#13;
    10. Post and telecommunications&#13;
    11. Textiles and wearing apparel&#13;
    12. Transport&#13;
    13. Transport equipment&#13;
    14. Wood and paper&#13;
&#13;
2.3. Assessment of reliability of Eora data at the national and sectoral level&#13;
In most cases Eora results provide a reasonably accurate estimate for key indicators of GVC&#13;
competitiveness at the country level, and of relative performance of different sectors, both within a&#13;
country and in relation to comparator countries. Further, they are likely to provide a largely reliable&#13;
approximation of the sectoral decomposition of value added and the direction of value-added trade, as&#13;
well as trends for these indicators over an 11-year time period (especially as all three data-points are&#13;
derived from the same source and methodology). Thus, in the absence of national input-output tables&#13;
(IOTs) and supply-use tables (SUTs), and despite uncertainties (particularly at the sectoral level), Eora&#13;
provides the best available and internationally comparable dataset for calculating key value-added trade&#13;
indicators, though they are best complemented by more nuanced sectoral analysis drawing on alternative&#13;
methodologies (e.g. producer surveys, firm-level analysis, and case studies).&#13;
&#13;
However, a few caveats relating particularly to the accuracy of the Eora data are in order. Firstly, it is&#13;
important to bear in mind that Eoraâ&#128;&#153;s MRIO tables are modeled based on existing sources â&#128;&#147; national&#13;
accounts data, Comtrade import and export data, among others â&#128;&#147; when national input-output or supply-&#13;
use tables were not available. Further, in order to achieve the MRIOâ&#128;&#153;s overall balancing requirements,&#13;
raw data on imports and exports has frequently been adjusted, with the overall focus on representing&#13;
large data items and fulfilling balancing conditions for large countries. Eoraâ&#128;&#153;s optimization approach&#13;
attempts to strike a balance between the frequent conflicts between country-wise total exports and&#13;
&#13;
6   Correspondence to ISIC classifications can be found in Appendix 3.&#13;
                                                                                                          5&#13;
&amp;#12;imports and trade balances but this can lead to substantial uncertainties, particularly for small values&#13;
(such as for the four SACU countries Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland that have not developed&#13;
national input-output tables). Given these slight imbalances, total gross exports are at times marginally&#13;
larger and/or smaller than the value added constituting it, and the sum of domestic and foreign value&#13;
added as a share of gross exports is generally not exactly equal to total gross exports at the national and&#13;
particularly sectoral level. As a result, indicators of domestic, foreign and indirect value as shares of&#13;
exports use total exported value added as the denominator, rather than gross exports. This better reflect&#13;
the relative importance of foreign and domestic contributions to exported value added7.&#13;
&#13;
In order to provide an indicative assessment of Eoraâ&#128;&#153;s reliability, data on exports and imports were&#13;
compared to results from the Comtrade database (using ISIC Rev. 3, which was also used to create the&#13;
correspondence for Eora). Furthermore the standard deviation of each sectorâ&#128;&#153;s non-exported output is&#13;
also presented. This can be found in Appendix 4. Based on this comparative analysis, Eora results&#13;
presented in this report should be interpreted with some caution.8&#13;
&#13;
Particularly, due to concerns about data quality for the SACU economies, as well as to a lesser extent the&#13;
price fluctuations for mineral products, the mining and quarrying sector was omitted from analysis and&#13;
dropped from the MRIO, with subsequent analysis based on a 25 sector summarized table for each&#13;
country9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7 The Eora Frequently Asked Questions provide an explanation for the causes of these imbalances: â&#128;&#156;data on countryâ&#128;&#144;wise total&#13;
exports and imports fundamentally conflicts with global trade balances. One cannot achieve a balanced global multiâ&#128;&#144;region inputâ&#128;&#144;&#13;
output table whilst at the same time respecting data on exports and imports. This means that in a real MRIO table, either&#13;
balancing conditions must be violated or raw data misâ&#128;&#144;represented.â&#128;&#157; Under ideal balancing conditions, national ratios of Gross&#13;
National Expenditure + exports versus Gross Domestic Product + imports should be 1, i.e. in an IO table the total of all inputs&#13;
to a sector a given sector (i.e. the column values) should equal the total value of that sectorâ&#128;&#153;s outputs (i.e. the row values).&#13;
However, due to data conflicts, this is in most cases a few per cent more or less than 1.&#13;
8 Eora developers state that â&#128;&#156;results will generally be uncertain at the sectoral level and for small sectors, but not necessarily&#13;
&#13;
uncertain for small countries, especially not for small countries with high-quality IO dataâ&#128;&#157; (Lenzen et al. 2013, p. 39).&#13;
9 In the case of Botswana, however, diamonds are classified under manufacturing and is, therefore, included in the analysis&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                6&#13;
&amp;#12;3. SACU EXPORTS AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION IN GLOBAL TRADE NETWORKS&#13;
&#13;
Before analyzing value added trade and participation in GVCs, it is worth profiling briefly the nature of&#13;
exports for the SACU countries and their integration into global trade networks. Moreover, as the analysis&#13;
of value added trade remains an inexact science, particularly for smaller countries (i.e BLNS). Therefore,&#13;
there it is useful to get a broad picture of potential GVC participation from the available aggregate trade&#13;
data.&#13;
&#13;
3.1. Overall trade integration&#13;
Trade openness â&#128;&#147; or trade share of GDP â&#128;&#147; is a standard measure to assess the importance of trade to a&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s economy, and by extension, its integration with global markets. Figure 1 shows trade openness&#13;
plotted against national wealth (measured as the log of GDP per capita). Traded shares of GDP increase&#13;
as countries grow wealthier, although regardless of income level small countries tend to have a larger&#13;
traded share of GDP than large ones â&#128;&#147; this is because large countries trade more internally, while small&#13;
countries tend not to have sufficiently large domestic markets. Figure 1 shows that most SACU countries&#13;
trade above the level that their incomes alone would predict, with Lesotho and to a lesser degree&#13;
Swaziland among the most trade-dependent countries in the world. Given they have relatively similar&#13;
populations as Lesotho and Swaziland and large mineral exports, Botswana and Namibia are actually&#13;
substantially less integrated into global trade. South Africa, meanwhile records a relatively low degree of&#13;
trade openness in regional terms, but still remains above the level of many of its peers, including China,&#13;
Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Overall the region sits in the middle between the highly integrated East Asian&#13;
economies and the poorly integrated South American ones.&#13;

3.2. Overview of main traded sectors&#13;
The SACU countries can be characterized as having two types of exporters. First, Botswana and Namibia,&#13;
rely heavily on the mining sector (especially diamonds in the case of Botswana and Namibia) and the&#13;
exports of raw materials (especially agricultural goods and food/beverages in the case of Namibia).&#13;
Second, Swaziland and Lesotho have narrow but well-developed industries that drive most export&#13;
earnings: in the case of Swaziland it is sugar and (related) concentrated beverage syrups; in Lesotho it is&#13;
apparels and textile. South Africa sits somewhere in the middle, with a large share of exports in mining&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         7&#13;
&amp;#12;(iron ore, gold, platinum, diamonds) but also a well-developed agricultural and manufacturing export&#13;
sector. Table 1 provides a breakdown of exports by broad industry classification for each country.&#13;
Thinking about traditional GVCs (vertically integrated production), the most relevant sectors are&#13;
manufacturing as well as some within agriculture. Here we see that while Botswana and Namibia appear&#13;
to have large shares of exports in manufacturing, this is mainly explained by the classification of diamonds&#13;
in the manufacturing sector; removing this tells a very different story. In the case of Botswana, diamonds&#13;
and crude materials account for more than 85% of total exports; in Namibia it is around 45%. Namibia&#13;
does, however, have substantial exports in manufacturing and machinery. South Africa is also fairly&#13;
skewed toward commodity exports, although it still has a large share of manufacturing exports. Swaziland&#13;
is highly concentrated in food (sugar) and processed sugar in the form of Coca-Cola syrup (classified under&#13;
chemicals). Lesotho, by contrast, looks quite different from the rest of the region, with more than 60% of&#13;
exports in manufacturing.&#13;

Turning to imports, Table 2 shows that manufactured goods account for a much larger share of imports&#13;
than for exports in the region (with the exception of Lesotho). Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s figures are again skewed by&#13;
diamond imports (for aggregation and trading); excluding these, Botswana again appears to be&#13;
significantly less integrated in manufacturing trade in relative terms than other countries in the region.&#13;
Other notable differences across countries include the much higher share of machinery and transport&#13;
equipment imports in South Africa and Namibia and the much higher share of food imports in Lesotho&#13;
and Swaziland.&#13;

3.3. Proxying GVC integration: trade in intermediates&#13;
Going beyond the broad sectoral classifications, we can also look at trade trends with respect to how&#13;
goods are normally used â&#128;&#147; e.g. as inputs into another production process (i.e. intermediate goods) or as&#13;
end products for businesses or consumers (i.e. consumption goods). The trade in intermediates is&#13;
fundamental to GVCs, who basic concept is â&#128;&#156;importing to exportâ&#128;&#157; or I2E as Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzales&#13;
(2013) call it. One country (for example South Africa) exports parts that are incorporated in the exports&#13;
of another country (for example Germany). This single flow of intermediate goods is the basis of two key&#13;
measures of supply chain integration, which help understanding better the role of a country in GVCs: on&#13;
the sales side, it indicates that a countryâ&#128;&#153;s exporters are selling into a GVC. On the sourcing side, it&#13;
indicates that the country is buying from a GVC. Patterns on the buying side provide information on the&#13;
source of technology transfer and the type of GVCs a country is likely to join. This ultimately affects the&#13;
growth of domestic value added since it affects the nature of the intra-firm know-how applied via GVCs.&#13;
Patterns on the selling side indicate, instead, the likely exposure to demand shocks. We can distinguish&#13;
three types of buyer roles in GVCs: for production of intermediate inputs in the value chain, for final&#13;
production destined as exports, and for assembly. The main supplier functions are also three: supply of&#13;
turnkey components, supply of other inputs, and supply of primary inputs (see Figure 2).&#13;
                                                                                                                     9&#13;

Figure 3 provides an aggregate view on the share of intermediates in SACU trade. We can see that share&#13;
of intermediates in exports varies substantially across countries and over time. With the notable&#13;
exception of Lesotho, all SACU countries have more than half their exports in intermediates. Botswana&#13;
records more than 90% of exports in intermediates, but this is skewed by the categorization of diamonds,&#13;
which alone accounts for more than 70% of exports. Both Lesotho and Swaziland show substantial&#13;
declines in the share of their exports in intermediate goods â&#128;&#147; in the case of Lesotho, the share of&#13;
intermediates fell dramatically from almost 50% in 2000 to just 12.2% in 2012. But while intermediates&#13;
tend to proxy for production chain integration, in the case of Swaziland and Lesotho, the decline in&#13;
intermediates is actually likely to be the result of GVC integration. Specifically, it is the result of&#13;
participation in the apparel GVC, where both countries specialize in final stage assembly. Indeed, as&#13;
shown in Table 3, apparel exports â&#128;&#147; where Lesotho, in particular, became concentrated in the 2000s, are&#13;
largely consumer products (rather than intermediates) and Lesotho and Swaziland have the lowest share&#13;
the intermediates in exports among all peer countries.&#13;
&#13;
In the case of South Africa, the share of intermediates in total exports fell slightly between 2000 and 2012.&#13;
This comes despite a significant increase in the share of intermediates exported in the transport&#13;
equipment sector (up from 13% to 22%). Similarly, intermediate exports have grown rapidly in the food&#13;
and beverages sector (up from 15% to 23%), but South Africa still sells more consumer food and&#13;
beverages products than most peers, perhaps indicative of a strong GVC position in this sector. South&#13;
Africaâ&#128;&#153;s virtual exit from global GVCs in apparel and footwear may be evidenced by the decline in&#13;
intermediate exports from close to 10% in 2000 to just 1.6% in 2012.&#13;
&#13;
Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s high share of intermediate exports is clearly distorted by diamonds. The sector-specific data&#13;
in Table 3 shows that Botswana has among the lowest share of intermediate exports across virtually all&#13;
sectors. Namibia shows a similar trend, with the one exception being their small electronics sector, which&#13;
experienced a strong shift toward intermediate products (while Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s exhibited the opposite shift).&#13;

Integration matters as much for imports as exports. Data in Figure 3 shows that the majority of peer&#13;
countries increased the share of imports in intermediate goods. In SACU, by contrast, only South Africa&#13;
increased imports of intermediates. The other four countries experienced declining relative imports of&#13;
intermediates, some significantly so: Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s intermediates fell from 60.8% of imports in 2000 to just&#13;
42.9% in 2012; Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s fell from 53.8% to 47.9%. Overall, SACU countries, with the exception of&#13;
Lesotho, come out lower than most peer countries in their reliance on imported intermediates. Again,&#13;
the situation varies substantially by sector, although Botswana and Namibia fall well below the peer&#13;
average in every sector10.&#13;

3.4. Positioning in global trade networks&#13;
To get a further sense of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s links into global trade networks, we can look at measures of network&#13;
centrality. In Table 5, we report two measures of local centrality along with two measures of global&#13;
centrality:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Local centrality refers only to the first order links of each country (neighbors), namely outward&#13;
         â&#128;&#156;Node Degreeâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;Node Strengthâ&#128;&#157;, where the former measures the centrality in terms of the&#13;
         number of markets reached by SACU countries and the latter the intensity of exports.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Global centrality measures describe the characteristics of nodesâ&#128;&#153; neighborhood, and in particular&#13;
         assess the extent to which a country trades with partners that are themselves important&#13;
         exporters. â&#128;&#156;Out-closenessâ&#128;&#157; is a measure of how close a node is with respect to all other nodes, in&#13;
         terms of intensity of export relations. It therefore provides a measure of the relevance of links.&#13;
         â&#128;&#156;Eigenvector centralityâ&#128;&#157;11 stresses the relevance of nodes, i.e. it is important to assess if a node&#13;
         is connected to central players or to peripheral ones. Specifically, a node's eigenvector centrality&#13;
         is determined by the eigenvector centrality of its neighbors, so that their centrality is also taken&#13;
         into account. In general, countries displaying high value of eigenvector centrality are the ones&#13;
         which are connected to many other countries which are, in turn, connected to many others. The&#13;
         largest values correspond to countries in large and cohesive (high-density) sub-networks.&#13;

four key sectors that tend to be traded in GVCs: agri-food, apparel, automotive, and electronics12. In&#13;
terms of local centrality, the results indicate that SACU ranked 14th out of 216 countries included in the&#13;
Comtrade database in 2010 in the Node Degree Index and 39th in the Node Strength Index, suggesting&#13;
that the region is the top-trading partner for a sufficiently large number of exporters but the intensity of&#13;
trade volumes is only moderate. It has also improved its relative importance since 2000, while relative&#13;
strength declined slightly. In terms of global centrality, SACU still ranks well but somewhat lower than for&#13;
local centrality, with an Out-Closeness ranking of 41 (down 6 places from a decade earlier) and an&#13;
Eigenvector Centrality ranking of 34. Sectoral rankings are broadly in line with the overall ranking,&#13;
although the region ranks notably lower in apparel in both local and global centrality and notably higher&#13;
in electronics (as well as agri-food global centrality).&#13;
&#13;
Table 6 compares South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s centrality indexes in 2010 with those of 20 peer countries. The results&#13;
for total trade suggest that South Africa performs relatively well, but with the exception of Node Degree,&#13;
tends to be at the lower end of comparisons with BRICS and East Asian peers.&#13;

Finally, network representations help visualize the complexity and heterogeneity of actors and trade links&#13;
in GVCs. Figure 4 and Figure 5, visualize the network reporting the strongest flow for each node. The most&#13;
connected countries â&#128;&#147; the central nodes, as they are the main trade partner for several countries â&#128;&#147; are&#13;
the â&#128;&#156;rootsâ&#128;&#157; of the tree, distinguished from the peripheral countries â&#128;&#147; the â&#128;&#156;leaves.â&#128;&#157; The size of the node&#13;
reflects a countryâ&#128;&#153;s strength or centrality in the network. The thickness of links reflects the weight of the&#13;
value added relation. Larger bilateral trade flows are portrayed by closer distances between nodes.&#13;
Ideally, we would like to present the network using trade in value added data. However, such data are&#13;
not available yet for a sufficient number of countries. Instead, we present the network for trade in&#13;
consumption13 goods (Figure 4) and intermediates (Figure 5).&#13;
&#13;
In the case of SACU14, trade in consumption goods provides a sense of where the region sells its end&#13;
products and where it is most linked into GVCs in terms of its backward integration (i.e. where it sources&#13;
from). Here, we see the strongest links are with the EU trade network based around Germany. Figure 4&#13;
shows that SACU (mainly South Africa) is an important node linking some other regional economies into&#13;
the European trade network. It also shows that while SACU is a significant player in the European regional&#13;
trade network, it is has less direct links into Germany than trade partners like Eastern Europe and Turkey&#13;
(as illustrated by its positioning further from Germany) and its level of trade is lower (as illustrated by&#13;
thinner connecting lines).&#13;
&#13;
The story is a bit different for intermediates (Figure 5), where China is demonstrably more central to trade&#13;
for more countries than in consumer products. Here, SACU is primarily linked into the Chinese production&#13;
network. Although the region is notably distant from the core of the Chinese network, it appears to play&#13;
an even stronger role in intermediates as a regional node for Southern Africa.&#13;

&amp;#12;4. STEPPING INTO GVCs: MEASURING EXPORT VALUE-ADDED IN SACU&#13;
&#13;
Section 3 of this note provided an initial overview of the scale and nature of integration of SACU countries&#13;
in global trade networks. The analysis of trade in intermediate goods provided an initial view on SACU&#13;
countriesâ&#128;&#153; trade in the types of products that generally typify GVC trade. Up until this point, however, we&#13;
have been considering only data on â&#128;&#156;gross tradeâ&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; i.e. we have not considered the â&#128;&#156;value added tradeâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
that is at the heart of analysis of global value chains. In this section, the analysis hones in more on GVC&#13;
trade by isolating value-added trade from our traditional (gross) trade figures; it is followed in the&#13;
remaining sections by further analysis of the nature of GVC trade.&#13;
&#13;
4.1. Why understanding (domestic) value added is important in studying GVCs&#13;
One of the major implications of the growth of trade in fragmented global production networks is the&#13;
inflation of aggregate export figures. This results from the double and triple counting of intermediates as&#13;
they cross over national borders in the process of coming together to form an end product. For example,&#13;
a Korean semiconductor that is incorporated into an ipod will be counted as a Korean export when it is&#13;
shipped to Thailand to be assembled into an internal drive, and then again in Thailandâ&#128;&#153;s exports as the&#13;
drive is shipped to China for final assembly, and then again from China as it is exported as a finished ipod.&#13;
As a result, understanding a countryâ&#128;&#153;s gross exports as well as exports of domestic value-added is&#13;
important for understanding trade performance and GVC participation. It provides an insight into the&#13;
critical issue of how trade performance contributes to the domestic economy in terms of output, industry&#13;
linkages, and employment.&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, what matters most for a country is not gross exports (which may include a significant share of&#13;
foreign value added via imported inputs) but the domestic value added (DVA) embodied in gross exports.&#13;
Figure 6 exemplifies the decomposition of gross exports for the auto industry. Domestic value added&#13;
consists of value added created in the auto industry, value added created in other sectors supplying the&#13;
auto industry, and of re-imported intermediates (which have been previously exported).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A countryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to benefit from GVCs is best shown by the evolution of its DVA embodied in gross&#13;
exports over time (see Box 2). At the industry level, DVA consists of value added created in a specific&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            16&#13;
&amp;#12;industry itself, value added created in other domestic sectors supplying this industry, as well as previously&#13;
exported intermediates re-imported from abroad for use in a given industry. In simple terms, an increase&#13;
in DVA embodied in gross exports over time signifies greater value addition within the country itself. As&#13;
a function of productivity, it is associated with a countryâ&#128;&#153;s breadth, variety and sophistication of tasks and&#13;
activities (Taglioni and Winkler 2014a). Beyond the likely welfare and employment implications, this also&#13;
has a broader significance for trade policy.15&#13;
&#13;
 Box 2: Domestic and foreign value added: substitutes or complements?&#13;
 Operating in GVCs is fundamentally about global trade integration â&#128;&#147; this means not only exporting within&#13;
 production chains but also making use of imported parts and components. Thus, while nominal domestic value&#13;
 added (DVA) is ultimately the measure of aggregate success for any country, the level of foreign value added&#13;
 (FVA) embodied in a countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports is an important measure of GVC integration.&#13;
&#13;
 Mathematically, in percentage terms, DVA and FVA are substitutes â&#128;&#147; if a country increases its FVA from 40% to&#13;
 50% of exports that necessarily means that DVA has declined from 60% to 50%. But that does not mean that&#13;
 maximizing DVA share should be the primary goal, particularly if it achieved through an import substitution&#13;
 strategy that results in producers having to accept lower quality or higher priced inputs (or simply inputs that are&#13;
 incompatible with those required by GVC-oriented buyers). In this case, maximizing DVA share comes at the&#13;
 expense of total volumes, as domestic producers may experience declining competitiveness in global markets&#13;
 and may be unable to participate in GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
 From a dynamic perspective, therefore, DVA and FVA can be seen as complements. Access to quality and cost&#13;
 effective imported inputs raises firm competitiveness, resulting in higher exports and therefore higher nominal&#13;
 DVA. Over time, technology spillovers from imported inputs may also result in some goods and services becoming&#13;
 competitively produced in domestic markets, leading to a productive substitution of imports for domestic supply,&#13;
 and potentially even higher DVA share.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.2. Is domestic value added increasing in SACU countries?&#13;
All five SACU countries have been able to grow their DVA in gross exports, albeit at different rates.&#13;
Figure 7 examines compound annual growth rates of DVA embodied in gross exports16 in the five SACU&#13;
countries as well as their comparators both from 2000 to 2011. Among the five SACU countries, Lesotho&#13;
has recorded the largest annual increase at 13% followed by South Africa and Namibia (12%) and&#13;
Swaziland (11%). Lesotho also performs well in relation to its comparators. Only Bolivia, Lao PDR, and&#13;
Zambia have seen a larger increase in DVA over the eleven-year period. The performance of the four&#13;
leading SACU countries is comparable to that of Argentina, Paraguay, and Rwanda. By contrast, Botswana&#13;
lags behind significantly at just 5% CAGR â&#128;&#147; in fact, Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s growth in DVA is the lowest among all 19&#13;

&amp;#12;Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the fastest rates of DVA growth, such as Lesotho and Rwanda, occurred&#13;
in those economies that started exports from a very low base and which also have a low share of DVA&#13;
embodied in gross exports as a share of GDP (Figure 8). Here, SACU countries still show relatively weak&#13;
performance relative to peers. Only South Africa (increase from 16% to 18%) is among the leading&#13;
countries in the group of comparators, though it is far eclipsed by Thailand (where exported DVA as share&#13;
of GDP grew from 38% to 44%). Botswana saw a decline in its DVA as a share of GDP to 4%, with only&#13;
Rwanda having a lower rate. Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland saw marginal increases from a low base&#13;
suggesting that their largest export sectors (which experience strong DVA growth) may have relatively&#13;
low rates of domestic value addition. Interestingly, the largest increases between 2000 and 2011 were&#13;
registered in Zambia, Thailand, Argentina, and Bolivia â&#128;&#147; all of which are relatively large producers of&#13;
metals and/or commercial agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
To start understanding what may be behind the DVA performance in a country, it can be useful to&#13;
compare trends in DVA with trends in the development of gross exports (the latter reflects the standard&#13;
measure of exports). This is show in Figure 9. Here, we see that growth in DVA has largely tracked gross&#13;
export growth for the five SACU economies, as well as for most comparators. However, for both Botswana&#13;
and Lesotho gross export growth has been faster than DVA growth (by 2% and 3%, respectively),&#13;
suggesting that exports from sectors with lower rates of domestic value addition have been growing more&#13;
rapidly. This may be indicative of increasing GVC participation, but it may also simply reflect changing&#13;
composition in the export basket (see Box 3).&#13;

&amp;#12;Looking at the share of DVA in gross exports (in addition to their relative growth) is also critical to&#13;
understanding the nature of exports and of GVC integration. Figure 10 highlights significant differences&#13;
among SACU countries in this regard, as well as significant changes over time in some countries. While&#13;
Lesotho (52%) has the lowest share of DVA among the entire set of peers and Swaziland is among the&#13;
lowest (63%), the rest of the region has DVA shares of exports between 70% and 85%, generally in line&#13;
with the peer countries, although somewhat on the lower end. All BLNS countries had declining DVA as&#13;
share of exports â&#128;&#147; in Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s case a striking 16 percentage point decrease, and 7 percentage points for&#13;
Botswana. The 11-year time period 2000 to 2011 largely covers Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s integration into the textile and&#13;
apparel GVC (facilitated in part by AGOA and its third-country fabric provision), most likely explaining the&#13;
scale of the change over the time period. Among comparators, Argentina and Tanzania, and to a lesser&#13;
degree Kenya also saw substantial decline in DVA as share of exports, while Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand,&#13;
and Zambia saw significant increases.&#13;

 Box 3: The challenge of interpreting DVA results&#13;
 As noted earlier, what matters ultimately for a country is growing DVA (in nominal terms) over time, regardless&#13;
 of the relative share of DVA. But from the perspective of understanding GVC participation and performance, the&#13;
 interpretation of high or low levels of DVA growth is not always that obvious. While we want to see increasing&#13;
 DVA, rapid integration into global production chains is likely to result in lower DVA as a share of gross exports. In&#13;
 fact, evidence of decreasing DVA a share of gross exports can be indicative of participation in longer and more&#13;
                                                                                                                    20&#13;
&amp;#12; sophisticated value chains in which more imported value added is in turn being re-exported (Taglioni and Winkler&#13;
 2014b). While increasing DVA may reflect growth in the services economy, which tends to have short value chains&#13;
 and high values of exported DVA as a share of exports.&#13;
&#13;
 Moreover, DVA growth is affected by important factors that are not linked directly to GVCs (at least not the&#13;
 variety of GVCs associated with vertically fragmented production). Most notably for SACU and other developing&#13;
 countries with large agriculture and natural resource exports, growth in commodity exports and changing global&#13;
 commodity prices will shape DVA measures significantly (for example, extractives exports may have high DVA,&#13;
 despite weak links to domestic labor markets and supply chains). Increasing DVA can also signify increasing&#13;
 quality of exports (higher unit prices) regardless of whether these exports are within GVCs. And so changing&#13;
 sectoral composition of the export basket will have a significant impact on the DVA measure.&#13;
&#13;
 The figure below provides a basic overview of the some of the different situations that may explain various DVA&#13;
 outcomes, based around: i) the level of DVA to gross exports; and ii) the growth of DVA to gross exports. This&#13;
 underscores the importance of going beyond the aggregate analysis to understand better the factors shaping&#13;
 DVA performance, and the degree to which they are shaped by GVC participation and position. At minimum, it&#13;
 highlights the need to look at data at the sectoral level. Beyond this, assessing sectoral structure and performance&#13;
 at a qualitative level is likely to be important in order to interpret the results effectively.&#13;
&#13;
 Note that in the case of the analysis presented in this note, minerals exports have been excluded, so at least&#13;
 some of the effect of natural resources exports on the DVA figures is controlled for in the results presented here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.3. Where is DVA growth coming from? â&#128;&#147; sectoral assessment&#13;
Performance at the sectoral level has been highly heterogeneous and can reveal a bit more about the&#13;
particular sources of DVA growth. Table 7 summarizes for each of the five SACU countries the five non-&#13;
mining sectors contributing the most to overall DVA for the year 2011, including the sectoral compound&#13;
annual growth as well as the DVA in exports as a share of total exports. In terms of their overall DVA in&#13;
exports, it is striking â&#128;&#147; if not entirely surprising â&#128;&#147; how much more DVA as share of total exports is&#13;
contributed by services sectors. Examining individual countries, this disaggregation suggests that&#13;
Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s overall stagnation is in part attributable to slower growth in manufacturing sectors. Similarly,&#13;
the pace of Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s DVA growth is greatest in services sectors, although these are starting from a very&#13;
low base. In Namibia, the leading sources of DVA growth are predominantly in food processing and&#13;
manufacturing. South Africa, on the other hand, has a relatively balanced level of growth across its&#13;
leading sectors. This sectoral disaggregation by country is expanded in Appendix 5.&#13;

Figure 11 compares DVA growth rates for two sectors that are important in most SACU countries â&#128;&#147;&#13;
Agriculture and Food &amp; Beverages â&#128;&#147; with those of peers. For the first of these â&#128;&#147; Agriculture â&#128;&#147; the SACU&#13;
countries are, with the exception of Botswana, towards the middle, with DVA growth ranging from 9%&#13;
(Lesotho) to 16% (Swaziland). Looking over the most recent five years (2006-2011, not shown in the figure&#13;
below), Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s growth of 30% far exceeds all other countries. The highest performers in agriculture&#13;
tended to be the least developed comparator countries, Zambia (24%) and Lao PDR (22%), with the&#13;
middle-income countries in the sample generally achieving growth rates between 5% and 15%. For the&#13;
Food and Beverages sector, the SACU countries again perform in the middle, with Namibia and South&#13;
Africa having the highest overall performance (12%). While Lesotho and Botswana lag at 8% annual&#13;
                                                                                                                     22&#13;
&amp;#12;growth. Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s growth in the 2006-2011 period (not shown) was again substantial (26% CAGR). Again&#13;
the highest performers are the less developed comparators Zambia (28%), Bolivia (19%), and Lao PDR&#13;
(16%); but low income countries also showed the lowest growth, including Cambodia (3%) and Tanzania&#13;
(4%).&#13;

Complementing the sectoral DVA growth with data on DVA share of total exports over time in these&#13;
sectors can provide further insights into GVC developments. Figure 12 shows these results for the&#13;
Agriculture and Food &amp; Beverages sectors. In Agriculture, Swaziland saw a large increase in DVA share of&#13;
gross exports, from 75% to 86%. This was the second largest change in any country and, if the data is&#13;
correct, it would most likely reflect changing composition of agricultural exports. Lao PDR experienced&#13;
the largest growth in DVA share (15 percentage points), while Zambia and Cambodia also showed large&#13;
growth in its DVA share. The SACU countries all tended to be in the lower half of the comparator group&#13;
in terms of DVA share, indicating that their agricultural exports make greater use of imported inputs.&#13;
&#13;
For the Food &amp; Beverages sector, South Africa has by far the highest share of DVA among the SACU&#13;
countries (at 85% in 2011), while the rest of the region showed relatively low levels of DVA. Both&#13;
Botswana and Lesotho experienced large declines in DVA share over the decade and Swaziland, while&#13;
experiencing growth, showed the second lowest DVA share among all peers (at 61%, just after Botswana&#13;
at 60%). The findings suggest that domestic processing in BLNS increasingly relies on imported inputs,&#13;
most likely (in the case of this sector) from intra-regional sources.&#13;

For tourism, proxied through the Eora â&#128;&#156;hotels and restaurantsâ&#128;&#157; sector (see Figure 13), Lesotho, Swaziland, and&#13;
Namibia have all seen rapid growth (16%-20%), while South Africa and Botswana (13% and 11%, respectively)&#13;
experienced relatively strong growth but still trailed most peers. In terms of DVA share of gross exports (&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            24&#13;
&amp;#12;Figure 14), however, there are stark differences in the region. South Africa shows the highest DVA among&#13;
all peers (near 95%) while the rest of the region trails most peers. Swaziland (61%) and Lesotho (62%)&#13;
have particularly low levels of domestic value added in tourism.&#13;

The textiles &amp; apparel and transport equipment sectors (see&#13;
Figure 15) provide a useful comparative overview of the manufacturing sectors that tend to be most GVC-&#13;
oriented on a global basis. For textiles &amp; apparel, the five SACU countries look broadly similar to East&#13;
Asian and South American comparators and ahead of most African peers, with all five achieving annual&#13;
compound DVA growth at or near 10% (Swaziland lags at 8% and Namibia leads at 15%, but from a small&#13;
base). For the transport equipment sector, Swaziland (17% growth) has been the fastest growing country&#13;
among all comparators, other than Kenya. Again, however, this comes from a very small base; Botswana&#13;
has also experienced strong growth (14%) in DVA. The other three SACU countries all rank towards the&#13;
middle of the table, with growth in DVA between 9% and 10%.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of DVA share of exports (&#13;
Figure 16), Botswana, Lesotho, and Namibia have seen their exported DVA as a share of total sectoral&#13;
exports decline in both manufacturing sectors â&#128;&#147; in some cases quite substantially. For example, Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
DVA embodied in gross exports as a share of gross exports in textiles fell from 66% to 53% and Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
from 71% to 60%, while Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s fell in transport equipment from 68% to 49% and Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s from 64%&#13;
to 54%. This suggests these value chains may have grown in length and complexity, with less value added&#13;
in country, and/or that Lesotho and Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s tasks have become lower value-added. South Africa and&#13;
Swaziland in both sectors have remained reasonably consistent over the decade, although South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
DVA share is substantially above that of Swaziland in both sectors. It is worth noting that relatively low&#13;
DVA shares in these sectors may indicate greater GVC participation. For example, South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s DVA&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             25&#13;
&amp;#12;share in automotive (55%) is similar to that of countries like Thailand and Argentina, both of which have&#13;
significant automotive sectors, while other countries with limited automotive sectors show higher DVA&#13;
shares.&#13;

&amp;#12;5. GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN PARTICIPATION AND POSITIONING&#13;
&#13;
The analysis of trends in value-added trade give some insight into how SACU countries are integrating&#13;
into GVCs, but the analysis still remains a step removed from actual GVC trade. In this section, we use the&#13;
Eora database to calculate recently developed indicators on GVC participation and positioning.&#13;
&#13;
5.1. GVC participation â&#128;&#147; introduction and overall index&#13;
A countryâ&#128;&#153;s level of participation in GVCs can in part be assessed based on both its forward and backward&#13;
integration:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Forward integration, or indirect value added (IVA) â&#128;&#147;refers to a countryâ&#128;&#153;s share of value added&#13;
        embodied in other countriesâ&#128;&#153; exports â&#128;&#147; i.e. producing intermediates that you export to other&#13;
        countries, who will then add further value and export them as finished products or further stage&#13;
        intermediates.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Backward integration, or foreign value added (FVA) â&#128;&#147; is the share of foreign value added in&#13;
        embodied in a countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports â&#128;&#147; i.e. intermediate inputs imported from other countries that&#13;
        you then add value to and export as finished products or further stage intermediates.&#13;
&#13;
Both forward and backward integration matter, but neither should be inherently maximized. As discussed&#13;
in Box 3, the products involved and the qualitative nature of the integration determine the benefits that&#13;
accrue from it. Backward integration provides access to quality inputs, which contributes to downstream&#13;
competitiveness; it also has significant potential to deliver productivity spillovers through access to global&#13;
frontier technologies. As such, backward integration tends to be particularly important for developing&#13;
countries as it links to a number of measures of structural transformation. But taken to the extreme,&#13;
backward integration may crowd out local production and limit domestic value addition. Similarly,&#13;
forward integration is an indicator of integration into value chains and also provides opportunities to&#13;
benefit from technology spillovers. But the desirability of forward integration depends a lot on what is&#13;
being exported and where you sit on the value added chain. High levels of forward integration in&#13;
developing countries can often be associated with higher resource dependency and is negatively linked&#13;
to measures of diversification and structural change (AfDB 2014).17 On the other hand, countries like the&#13;
US and Japan have high forward integration by selling leading edge technologies (with high value added)&#13;
into the early stage of global production processes.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 17 reports the GVC participation index for SACU countries and peers in 2000 and 2011, based on&#13;
data from the Eora database. The GVC participation index combines the measures of forward and&#13;
backward integration18, each of which will be elaborated on in more detail in the next section. The index&#13;
is intended to indicate the extent to which a country participates in vertically integrated production&#13;
(Koopman et al. 2010). The higher the foreign value added in gross exports and the higher the value of&#13;
inputs exported to third countries and used in their exports, the higher the participation value. This tends&#13;
to favor small, open economies, so it is perhaps unsurprising that Lesotho stands out as the most GVC-&#13;
integrated of all peers, particularly given what we know about the development of its apparel sector in&#13;
the 2000s. Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s GVC participation measure increased by more than 50% over the decade. Other&#13;
countries that show significantly growing GVC participation include Tanzania, Rwanda, and Zambia. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17 Domestic value added and foreign value added by definition should equal to the total sum of exports and thus - as the corollary&#13;
of DVA - a declining share of domestic value added in total gross exports will by definition result in increased foreign value added&#13;
as a share of exports. Due to the balancing considerations outlined earlier, this does not hold completely for the Eora dataset.&#13;
18 The index combines FVA and IVA, both as a share of gross exports&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                 27&#13;
&amp;#12;South American and (surprisingly) East Asian peers also experienced declining GVC participation. What is&#13;
notable from the review of peer countries is that while those countries which are dependent on&#13;
commodity exports fare well in terms of DVA, they perform less well when measuring GVC participation.&#13;

5.2. What is driving GVC participation? â&#128;&#147; forward versus backward integration&#13;
But while the GVC Participation is a useful initial indicator, what matters much more are the components&#13;
that make up this index. Figure 18 reports backward and forward integration as a share of gross exports&#13;
for SACU and peer countries in 2011, and gives a perspective on what is driving the broad measure of&#13;
GVC participation. This is followed in Figure 19 with an illustration of growth in forward and backward&#13;
integration over the decade. It shows that, overall, SACU countries tend to be slightly less forward&#13;
integrated than peers and slightly more backward integrated; but with the exception of Lesotho, growth&#13;
in both forward and backward integration is trailing many peers. Reviewing each country briefly:&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Botswana: More forward integrated (41%) than backward (28%), although forward integration is&#13;
         likely to be distorted by diamonds, as is suggested by the very low growth over the past decade&#13;
         (1%). Backward integration is relatively high, but growing slowly.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Lesotho: Highest level of backward integration (48%) and highest growth (20%) among all peers;&#13;
         forward integration much lower (18%) and trailing most peers (although growing rapidly),&#13;
         reflecting focus on assembly stage of apparel manufacturing.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Namibia: Slightly above average level (28%) and growth (14%) of backward integration, while&#13;
         forward integration remains limited (19%).&#13;
    ï&#130;·    South Africa: Below average backward integration (17%), which is common for larger countries&#13;
         (although Thailandâ&#128;&#153;s backward integration is 28%); forward integration moderately high 33%.&#13;
         Growth is moderate in both FVA and IVA.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Swaziland: High level of backward integration (42%) but among lowest forward integration&#13;
         among peers (17%); growth in both FVA and IVA among the lowest of peers.&#13;

&amp;#12;5.3. Sectoral drivers of GVC participation&#13;
At the sectoral level, there is considerable heter ogeneity among these countriesâ&#128;&#153; growth rates in foreign and&#13;
and indirect value added (see&#13;
&#13;
Figure 20). For Botswana, foreign value added increased the most in transport equipment (18%), along&#13;
with metal products and wood and paper (17% each). As was the case for DVA, FVA in financial&#13;
intermediation declined substantially (-15%) while other manufacturing and agriculture were stagnant.&#13;
In Namibia, the largest growth in foreign content was in the metal products (20%) and electrical&#13;
machinery and transport sectors (19% each); financial intermediation also showed a sharp decline in FVA.&#13;
For Lesotho, growth in foreign content was highest in services sectors (especially hotels and restaurants,&#13;
post and telecommunications, and transport). Swaziland showed a similar pattern of strong growth in&#13;
services FVA (with the exception of decline in financial intermediation), but showed much weaker growth&#13;
in other areas. For South Africa, FVA increases were largest in agriculture and services sectors, while&#13;
manufacturing FVA growth was modest.&#13;
&#13;
Financial intermediation and agriculture consistently shows the lowest FVA as a share of gross exports&#13;
while transport equipment shows the highest foreign content (see Appendix 6). Other manufacturing&#13;
sectors, including electrical and machinery and food and beverages also show relatively high foreign&#13;
content across the region.&#13;
&#13;
Growth in value added exports embodied in third countriesâ&#128;&#153; exports (indirect value added) came across&#13;
a broad range of sectors, with agriculture (except Botswana) and services particularly strong. In Botswana,&#13;
the most rapid growth in IVA came in transport and communications, followed by tourism, while most&#13;
other sectors were stagnant or in decline. In Namibia, Swaziland, and Lesotho growth in IVA was relatively&#13;
strong across the board, although the rates of growth were substantially higher in Lesotho. A similar story&#13;
of broad sectoral IVA growth can be seen in South Africa.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Looking at performance in individual sectors is useful but runs the risk of obscuring the bigger picture,&#13;
particularly as sectors vary substantially in their contributions to GVC participation across the countries.&#13;
Figure 21 aggregates sectors according to the OECDâ&#128;&#153;s classification of technology content in sectors. This&#13;
aggregation gives a better sense of where foreign content embodied in GVCs is coming from across the&#13;
SACU countries and the type of sectors where its GVC exports are feeding into. This is critical for&#13;
understanding the potential of generating spillovers from GVC participation. The data on foreign value&#13;
added shows that Swaziland and South Africa (and to a lesser degree Namibia) gain most of their foreign&#13;
value added embodied in exports from manufacturing sectors, with a substantial amount coming from&#13;
high technology sectors. Indeed, these countries compare very favorably to peers, although trail&#13;
substantially behind Thailand (driven by large FVA in the electrical and machinery sector) and Argentina&#13;
(FVA in transport equipment). In the case of Swaziland, the high technology FVA is coming mainly from&#13;
exports embodying foreign content in the electrical and machinery sector, while in South Africa it comes&#13;
from both electrical and machinery and the transport equipment sectors. From the perspective of&#13;
facilitating technology spillovers, Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s imported content is among the least favorable across all peer&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         31&#13;
&amp;#12;In terms of IVA, the story is similar, although the differences are less stark across countries. What is&#13;
notable for SACU and just about all peers is that the profile of their forward contribution to GVCs is much&#13;
less technology intense than their backward integration. This allows for some tentative conclusions about&#13;
relative positioning in GVCs (see Section 5.5). That said, contribution to services exports of other&#13;
countries appears to be significant, which may represent interesting opportunities for learning and&#13;
upgrading.&#13;

&#13;
5.4. Geographical drivers of GVC participation&#13;
Understanding the direction of forward integration (the selling side of GVCs) is important for identifying&#13;
potential sources of shocks a country may face (see Appendix 7) 1920. For South Africa, the most important&#13;
destination is Germany, followed by the UK and Netherlands. This underscores the continuing reliance&#13;
on European demand in GVC-oriented sectors. The BLNS does not register as a significant source of IVA&#13;
for South Africa. For Botswana, Israel â&#128;&#147; presumably as a destination for diamonds and other minerals â&#128;&#147;&#13;
makes up over 30% of Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s IVA, followed by the UK, Germany and Norway (all of which grew their&#13;
share from 1996 to 2011 at the expense of regional neighbors). For Lesotho, the largest share of IVA is in&#13;
the â&#128;&#156;rest of worldâ&#128;&#157; sector, followed by Belgium and Germany. Namibia also shows a strong link to the&#13;
European market, with IVA highest in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium.&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, understanding the source of foreign value added (the buying side of GVCs) is important, in this&#13;
case for identifying the source of technology transfer and the type of GVCs a country is likely to join. This&#13;
ultimately affects the growth of domestic value added since it affects the nature of the intra-firm and&#13;
armâ&#128;&#153;s length transfer of know-how and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to absorb tacit knowledge (i.e. business&#13;
models and all other types of knowledge that cannot be codified) and/or the knowledge embedded in&#13;
the imported inputs. Data on FVA sources for SACU countries is also available in Appendix 7. For South&#13;
Africa, FVA sources are spread across the three main global poles, with Germany as the largest&#13;
contributor, followed by the US and China. The questions for South Africa (which requires further&#13;
assessment) are: i) whether integration with more technologically advanced nations produces a premium&#13;
in terms of growth of the domestic value added embedded in exports; and, ii) whether distance matters&#13;
for the rate of growth. The latter is important since tacit knowledge is likely to flow more easily over&#13;
shorter distances and â&#128;&#147; assuming that the latter produces more spillovers â&#128;&#147; distance and trade costs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19 These figures are similar but not identical to those derived from the I2E index ( Baldwin and Gonzalez-Lopez 2013).&#13;
20  Here, (as for sectoral disaggregation), results should be treated with caution: in some cases statistical discrepancies (i.e. the&#13;
RoW sector) is among these countriesâ&#128;&#153; largest destination for intermediates. In SACU, this is the case with Lesotho. Further, trad e&#13;
flows within the SACU region are very poorly tracked (including by Comtrade).&#13;
                                                                                                                                  32&#13;
&amp;#12;particularly those affecting the services sector, may matter for the ability of countries to boost domestic&#13;
value added via GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
For the BLNS, the distance issue is less relevant â&#128;&#147; here, South Africa dominates as a source of&#13;
intermediates. Where South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s trade flows are measured in Eora, it is by far the largest exporter of&#13;
FVA, making up 60% of FVA imported into Botswana, Swaziland, and Namibia (it is not included for&#13;
Lesotho). For Botswana, the other main sources of FVA have traditionally been the Netherlands, US, and&#13;
Germany, with China emerging as a leading FVA source in 2011. Re-exported intermediates from South&#13;
Africa to Lesotho are not reported and as a result China and Chile, followed by India and Taiwan are the&#13;
main sources of backward linkages. Namibia also sources over 70% of foreign value added from South&#13;
Africa, followed by Germany and the US. As is the case for Botswana, China has become increasingly&#13;
important as a provider of inputs while inter-regional sourcing (besides South Africa) remains minimal.&#13;
Swaziland also depends on South Africa for the bulk of its FVA, followed by Germany and the US, though&#13;
their share has been declining as Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s has increased.&#13;
&#13;
5.5. Assessing GVC positioning&#13;
As discussed earlier, what is ultimately more important than participating in GVCs is capturing value that&#13;
facilitates sustainable growth and higher-quality employment. This depends, in part, on a countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
positioning within a GVC. It can be upstream (production of inputs at the beginning of the value chain) or&#13;
downstream (production of goods and services towards the end of the value chain) depending on its&#13;
specialization. Countries specialized in upstream activities produce the raw material or the intangibles&#13;
involved at the beginning of the production process (e.g., research and design). Countries concentrated&#13;
in downstream tasks specialize in the assembly of the final products or in customer services. Finally,&#13;
countries involved in activities at the center of the value chain focus on the standardized labor-intensive&#13;
manufacturing jobs. Again, it is not always obvious where a country would ideally want to be positioned&#13;
â&#128;&#147; it depends very much on the value chain in question. For some value chains, most of the value is&#13;
captured upstream, for others downstream; and in some cases both. Generally, speaking, mid-stream&#13;
activities (â&#128;&#156;at the center of the value chainâ&#128;&#157;, as described above) are least likely to be in a position to&#13;
capture significant value.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Upstreamnessâ&#128;&#157; of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s specialization can be measured by its â&#128;&#156;distance to final demandâ&#128;&#157; (AntrÃ s,&#13;
Chor, Fally and Hillberry, 2012) â&#128;&#147; i.e. the distance in terms of number of production stages between the&#13;
production of good i in country c and final demand21. Evidence suggests that only a few countries have&#13;
managed to move downstream. Most countries have increased their upstreamness because the overall&#13;
length of value chains has increased with the fragmentation of production. Moreover, the offshoring&#13;
process that lengthens GVCs tends to affect more the early stages of production, although a new wave&#13;
of services offshoring has been taking place in recent years (Taglioni and Winkler, forthcoming). A final&#13;
useful metric is to combine import and export upstreamness to compute the domestic length of the value&#13;
chain. A positive gap indicates that exports are relatively more downstream (or â&#128;&#156;closer to final demandâ&#128;&#157;)&#13;
compared with imports. This is the case in economies where the manufacturing sector has been a key&#13;
source of export-led growth, such as China, Japan, and Thailand. Conversely, a negative gap indicates that&#13;
a countryâ&#128;&#153;s export profile is more upstream than its import profile. This is the case in economies whose&#13;

&amp;#12;exports are concentrated in agriculture products and primary commodities, such as Australia, and New&#13;
Zealand. Or it may be the case that the country is a home to a sophisticated consumer market and&#13;
therefore an intensive importer of finished consumer goods, rather than being a reflection of its exports,&#13;
such as the United States.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 22 shows that most SACU countries export in upstream positions, relatively far from the final&#13;
consumers, and show a â&#128;&#156;negativeâ&#128;&#157; domestic GVC length. The exceptions here are Botswana (distorted by&#13;
the short value chain of diamonds) and Lesotho (final stage apparel assembly). Turkey, Thailand and&#13;
Mauritius appear to show a pattern of importing relatively upstream and exporting at a more&#13;
downstream stage, thus indicative of a positive domestic GVC length. By contrast, the South American&#13;
peers export further upstream than SACU and all show negative domestic GVC length. Between 2000 and&#13;
2012, almost all peer countriesâ&#128;&#153; exports became more upstream (probably as a result of increasing&#13;
fragmentation of global production), but South Africa, Swaziland, and Namibia moved further upstream&#13;
than most.&#13;

The relative structure of value chains and country positioning obviously varies considerably by sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Table 8 shows export upstreamness in key sectors in 2012. SACU countries appear to export slightly more&#13;
downstream than peers in agriculture and food and beverage sectors and significantly more so in&#13;
transport equipment, while they are positioned around the peer average in the other manufacturing&#13;
sectors. No SACU countries stand out as being appreciably more upstream or downstream across the&#13;
sectors, although Swaziland is quite a bit more upstream than SACU peers in food and beverages.&#13;
Analogously, the data on domestic length of GVCs (Table 9), suggests the SACU countries have longer&#13;
domestic chains in agriculture and agriprocessing, as well as transport equipment. But their import&#13;
patterns in other manufacturing sectors means that SACU countries generally show negative domestic&#13;
length in these sectors, indicating substantially shorter domestic value chains in manufacturing than in&#13;
most of the peer countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;6. SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS&#13;
&#13;
The increasing fragmentation of global production has the potential to offer substantial opportunities for&#13;
the five SACU countries: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. Particularly for the&#13;
four smaller SACU economies (the BLNS), proximity to and regional trade agreements with the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;headquarter economyâ&#128;&#157; South Africa both augment these opportunities and create risks of â&#128;&#156;crowding&#13;
outâ&#128;&#157;, with South Africa reaping the gains of any investments in the region.&#13;
&#13;
Overall the analysis in this note, which draws extensively on the Eora multi-region input-output database&#13;
over an eleven-year time period and including fourteen comparator countries, suggests that the SACU&#13;
region is moderately integrated into GVCs. But the scale and nature of this integration varies enormously&#13;
by country and sector.&#13;
&#13;
Considering overall trade integration first, the region fares well â&#128;&#147; less integrated than East Asia but more&#13;
so than might be expected given its peripheral location (and more so than South American peers).&#13;
However, the nature of integration tends to be biased toward imports, with exports largely commodity&#13;
dependent (with notable exceptions of South Africa, Lesotho, and Namibia).&#13;
&#13;
Taking the analysis a step further and looking at trade in intermediates, the picture for the region looks&#13;
less optimistic. Here, SACU as whole has a lower share of intermediates in both exports and imports as&#13;
compared to peer countries. Moreover, intermediates are declining as a share of exports and imports&#13;
(with the exception of exports in Namibia and imports in South Africa). This highlights that the regionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
apparent trade integration remains biased toward commodity exports and consumption imports, with&#13;
potentially rather limited GVC participation.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis of network integration highlights that South Africa, at least, remains a moderately important&#13;
player in global trade networks and a key regional hub both in consumption goods (where it is linked to&#13;
the European market) and intermediates (where it is increasingly linked to China). This data, however, is&#13;
based only on gross trade and not value-added trade and so South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s global position in&#13;
intermediates is likely to be biased strongly by commodity exports, obscuring its real participation in GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
Lesotho appears to have made the most strides in the region in terms of GVC participation, as evidenced&#13;
by rapidly growing gross exports and DVA, and a declining ratio of DVA to gross exports. By contrast,&#13;
Botswana fares poorly in measures of DVA growth and GVC integration, showing stagnant DVA and&#13;
declining DVA share of gross exports. Swaziland also shows relative stagnation in its performance. South&#13;
Africa and Namibia meanwhile show moderate performance, with South Africa in particular showing&#13;
fairly strong levels of GVC participation and moderate growth in DVA and DVA share. From a sectoral&#13;
perspective performance varies significantly, but what is most notable is that services sectors â&#128;&#147; and&#13;
particularly transport and hotels and restaurants â&#128;&#147; have in general been growing more rapidly than&#13;
manufactured goods.&#13;
&#13;
These results are also mirrored in the GVC participation index, for which Lesotho saw the largest increase&#13;
between 2000 and 2011 (from 48% to 70%). Among SACU economies only Namibia improved in this time&#13;
period (from 37% to 39%). However, all five countries are â&#128;&#147; broadly speaking â&#128;&#147; in the middle range&#13;
compared to the list of peer countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          36&#13;
&amp;#12;The region also shows big differences across countries in terms of the nature of this integration. Overall,&#13;
South Africa is the only country in the region showing relatively strong forward integration in GVCs;&#13;
Botswana also shows relatively high forward integration, but excluding diamonds, forward integration is&#13;
limited. Lesotho and Swaziland, by contrast, show the lowest forward integration among all peers, and&#13;
Namibia is also among the least forward integrated countries in the comparison. Lesotho, South Africa,&#13;
and to a lesser degree Namibia are well integrated backward into GVCs. Botswana and Swaziland perform&#13;
less well here, and both of these countries show stagnant performance over time across both forward&#13;
and backward integration.&#13;
&#13;
The direction of forward and backward integration shows the overwhelming dominance of South Africa&#13;
as a source country of foreign content for the other four SACU economies, which suggests that they are&#13;
more integrated into regional value chains than to global ones (see Keane, 2015). This may also have&#13;
implications for access to global frontier technology, and therefore to productivity growth potential.&#13;
China has grown substantially in significance, particularly as a source of foreign content. All countries,&#13;
however, remain highly dependent on European markets for their forward participation in GVCs.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the region appears to be positioned relatively upstream in GVCs, in particular South Africa,&#13;
Swaziland, and Namibia (while Lesotho is downstream positioned in the apparel GVC). While the region&#13;
appears to be better positioned than the South American peers, a clear gap is apparent with countries&#13;
like Thailand, Turkey, and Mauritius, which import relatively upstream in GVCs and then export further&#13;
downstream. By contrast, most SACU countries import further downstream than they export.&#13;
&#13;
In interpreting these results it is important to bear in mind the importance of the recent commodity&#13;
super-cycle on the relative export value of goods and services for commodity-dependent exporters&#13;
(including some of the SACU countries). This is likely to explain some of the trends observed, particularly&#13;
in relation to growth in forward and indirect value added. These results â&#128;&#147; particularly in conjunction with&#13;
existing sectoral studies on the export growth and diversification efforts of these economies â&#128;&#147; provide&#13;
compelling evidence of the varied pace of GVC integration in recent years in the region, as well as the&#13;
heterogeneity across sectors and source and destination countries.&#13;

Appendix 1: Overview of Eora and other MRIOs&#13;
A growing number of international and MRIO tables are allowing us to analyse sources and destinations&#13;
of value that flows through GVCs, identifying the role of countries and industries in supply chains.&#13;
Pioneered by Wassily Leontief in the 1940s, these were initially mostly applied to the analysis of national&#13;
accounts for individual countries and were later on used primarily for environmental and ecological&#13;
analysis (e.g. measuring responsibility for emissions) as well as in regional science (see Miller and Blair&#13;
2009 for an overview).&#13;
&#13;
In recent years, national account data has been integrated with bilateral trade data and information&#13;
about sourcing of inputs at the industry-level to derive information on use of domestic and imported&#13;
inputs, and in turn, where value is added along supply chains provided a new, easily accessible approach&#13;
to measuring trade in GVCs (see Figure 23 for an overview).&#13;
&#13;

world economy. Larger circles stand for higher coverage.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Of late, triggered by greater interest in understanding processes of international fragmentation and&#13;
global supply chains, numerous empirical papers have been published using existing input-output&#13;
databases (especially the forerunner of many recent MRIOs, the Global Trade Analysis Project, GTAP).&#13;
Measuring trade in value added via MRIOs has a number of clear benefits (see Ahmad 2013). Firstly, it&#13;
provides a crucial tool to understand a countryâ&#128;&#153;s actual industrial structure and the national and&#13;
international inter-linkages of sectors for developing growth and development strategies, as well as trade&#13;
and industrial policies. Secondly, it makes clear how particularly non-tariff barriers (including regulatory&#13;
measures) can impact competitiveness and upstream producers. Thirdly, it can help policymakers better&#13;
anticipate ex ante the potential impact of macroeconomic shocks. Fourthly, it can allow for calculations&#13;
of the â&#128;&#152;job contentâ&#128;&#153; of trade. Finally, environmentally extended MRIOs allow for an assessment of the&#13;
impact of trade as it affects ecosystem services.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                            40&#13;
&amp;#12;MRIO tables are usually constructed through harmonised national supply-use tables (SUTs) and/or input-&#13;
output tables (IOTs). These show truncations between domestic industries supplemented by tables&#13;
breaking down imports by users, and have increasingly become indispensible for relevant&#13;
macroeconomic and trade policy analyses (for an overview see Ahmad 2013, Jones et al. 2013,&#13;
Dietzenbacher et al. 2013, Amadou and Cabral 2014). 22 MRIO tables allow for analysis of value&#13;
contribution along supply chains, enabling the analysis of sources and destinations of value that flow&#13;
through GVCs (for recent examples see Johnson and Noguera, Lenzen et al. 2013, UNCTAD 2013). There&#13;
are now a number of global input-output databases that vary significantly in terms of country, sectoral&#13;
coverage, time span and approach (see Table 10 below).&#13;

The spate of recent MRIO tables greatly improves our understanding of how GVCs function in practice.&#13;
They are, however, subject to a degree of uncertainty â&#128;&#147; as is common with any applications using&#13;
accounts data and trade flow data â&#128;&#147; which is augmented when examining developing counties, where&#13;
statistical capacities tend to be substantially worse. Moreover, MRIO tables also suffer from a deficiency&#13;
faced in many other empirical approaches to trade flow analysis, namely they are not able to accurately&#13;
assess the impact of services. They furthermore are subject to two assumptions that contribute to their&#13;
uncertainty, the former of which particularly is relevant for analysing trade flows from developing&#13;
countries (OECD 2012). Firstly they assume that all products (for export and domestic use) have the same&#13;
import content (proportionality assumption â&#128;&#147; see Winkler and Milberg 2012) and secondly they assume&#13;
a uniform use of inputs among all firms in a sector (homogeneity assumption).&#13;
&#13;
The Eora MRIO dataset, has recently been used for GVC-related analyses in a number of international&#13;
reports (UNCTAD 2013, AfDB/OECD/UNDP 2014). It has several advantages to other databases (see&#13;
Lenzen et al. 2012). These include:&#13;
   1. It is disaggregated into 187 countries (including all SACU members), providing important&#13;
        advantages for assessing impacts of consumption and production on relatively poor countries;&#13;
   2. It has a historical time series spanning 1990-2011 (soon to be extended to 1970-2011 and&#13;
        updated with an approximate two year delay) based on an iterative process using an initial year&#13;
        estimate for 2000, overlaying estimates for 1999 and 2001 respectively with new data and then&#13;
        re-balancing;&#13;
   3. It includes tables of basic prices, as well as two margins (taxes on products and subsidies on&#13;
        products) with constant prices to be added soon;&#13;
   4. To clarify levels of uncertainty, standard deviation estimates have been calculated for all MRIO&#13;
        events;&#13;
   5. It is publically available at www.worldmrio.com&#13;
&#13;
In its construction, it was based on the principle of changing to the structure of the original data sources&#13;
as little possible for the sake of transparency. Its matrices are based on the use of the following types of&#13;
raw data (in order of assumed accuracy):&#13;
     ï&#130;· inputâ&#128;&#147;output (Iâ&#128;&#147;O) tables and main aggregates data from national statistical offices where these&#13;
          are available;&#13;
     ï&#130;· Iâ&#128;&#147;O compendia from Eurostat, IDE-JETRO, and OECD,&#13;
     ï&#130;· the UN National Accounts Main Aggregates Database ,&#13;
     ï&#130;· the UN National Accounts Official Data,&#13;
     ï&#130;· the UN Comtrade international trade database, and&#13;
     ï&#130;· the UN Servicetrade international trade database.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                          42&#13;
&amp;#12;This makes it well suited for dynamic analysis of smaller developing countries not included in other&#13;
datasets,23 however should be complemented by more nuanced sectoral analysis drawing on alternative&#13;
methodologies.&#13;

The calculation below of the different value added measures comes directly from Koopman et al. (2010)&#13;
who provide a full decomposition of value-added exports in a single framework encompassing previous&#13;
measures by Hummels et al. (2001) and Johnson and Noguera (2012), among others.&#13;
&#13;
They start with a standard input-output model where each country produces goods in N tradable sectors&#13;
(Leontief 1970, Miller and Blair 2009):&#13;
&#13;
X = (I â&#128;&#147; A)-1Y = LY,â&#128;¦&#13;
â&#128;¦ X is the 2í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 1 gross output vector for both countries&#13;
â&#128;¦ A is the 2í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 2í µí±&#129; coefficient matrix giving intermediate use of each countryâ&#128;&#153;s sector of goods&#13;
produced in r.&#13;
â&#128;¦ I is a 2í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 2í µí±&#129; identity matrix&#13;
â&#128;¦ Y is the 2í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 1 final demand vector for both countries&#13;
â&#128;¦ L is the 2í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 2í µí±&#129; Leontief inverse matrix.&#13;
&#13;
Assuming the case of a 2-region, 1 sector example (i.e. N=1) consisting of Botswana (indexed B) and the&#13;
rest of the world (indexed R), the two-country system can be written in block matrix notation as:&#13;
 í µí±&#139;       í µí°¿     í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133; í µí±&#140;í µí°µ&#13;
[ í µí°µ ] = [ í µí°µí µí°µ        ][ ]&#13;
 í µí±&#139;í µí±&#133;     í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí±&#133; í µí±&#140;í µí±&#133;&#13;
&#13;
Value added trade is calculated using V as a 1 Ã&#151; 2í µí±&#129; row vector with each element representing the&#13;
value added per unit industry output and each element in V gives the share of direct domestic value&#13;
added in total output.&#13;
&#13;
One can then calculate the value-added share (VAS) matrix as:&#13;
&#13;
                 í µí±&#137;             0 í µí°¿í µí°µí µí°µ          í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133;      í µí±&#137; í µí°¿         í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133;&#13;
í µí±&#137;í µí°´í µí±&#134; â&#137;¡ í µí±&#137;í µí°¿ = [ í µí°µ               ][                    ] = [ í µí°µ í µí°µí µí°µ                  ]&#13;
                  0            í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ        í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí±&#133;      í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ   í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí±&#133;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The columns in í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí°µ denote Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s domestic value-added share of domestically produced products&#13;
in a particular sector at home. The columns of í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ denote the share of the Rest of the Worldâ&#128;&#153;s value-&#13;
added in these goods produced in Botswana. The second set of N columns present value-added shares&#13;
for production in the RoW for Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s goods (í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133; ) and RoW value added for goods produced in&#13;
the RoW.&#13;
&#13;
The sum along each column must equal unity:&#13;
&#13;
í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí°µ + í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ = í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133; + í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí±&#133; = u&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23In comparative analysis (UNCTAD 2013) with the WIOD dataset, Eora was found to provide broadly similar results when&#13;
calculating foreign and domestic value added, albeit with a slight upward bias (which is to be expected as the greater number of&#13;
highly heterogeneous developing countries, many of which have been subsumed in WIODâ&#128;&#153;s rest of world matrix).&#13;
                                                                                                                             43&#13;
&amp;#12;In order to then determine domestic and imported content shares of each countryâ&#128;&#153;s production and trade&#13;
at the sector level, use gross exports as weight, letting í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151; = â&#136;&#145;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µí µí±&#133; = â&#136;&#145;í µí±&#133;(í µí°´í µí°µí µí±&#133; í µí±&#139;í µí±&#133; + í µí±&#140;í µí°µí µí±&#133; )&#13;
      í µí°¸      0&#13;
í µí°¸ = [ í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;      ]                                             ,                                           and&#13;
       0 í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151;&#13;
&#13;
Ì&#130;=[í µí±&#145;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#142;í µí±&#148;(í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151; )&#13;
E&#13;
                           0&#13;
                                    ]&#13;
          0         í µí±&#145;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#142;í µí±&#148;(í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151; )&#13;
&#13;
Where:&#13;
â&#128;¦ E is a 2í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; í µí±&#129; matrix&#13;
   Ì&#130; is a 2í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 2í µí±&#129; diagonal matrix&#13;
â&#128;¦ í µí°¸&#13;
&#13;
The value-added share by source country for each sector can then be calculated as:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
í µí±&#137;í µí°´í µí±&#134;_E       Ì&#130; = [í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µ&#13;
       Ì&#130; â&#137;¡ í µí±&#137;í µí°¿E                                 í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;&#13;
                                                                  ]&#13;
                    í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µ             í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;&#13;
&#13;
Each element is the total upstream direct and indirect value added by source country and sector in gross&#13;
exports for each sector (thus also including the specific sector itself).&#13;
&#13;
Looking at aggregates and 2 countries (i.e. in the example above) there is no need to define sectoral&#13;
shares, so one can just use&#13;
      í µí°¸     0&#13;
í µí°¸ = [ í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;      ]&#13;
       0 í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151;&#13;
&#13;
and in turn for value-added by source in gross exports:&#13;
&#13;
                         í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;   í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151;&#13;
VAS_E= VLE = [                                                 ]&#13;
                         í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;   í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151;&#13;
&#13;
The diagonal elements represent the domestic value-added of each countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports; off-diagonal&#13;
elements give the foreign value-added embodied in each countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports24:&#13;
&#13;
        í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;&#13;
DV= [                     ]&#13;
        í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151;&#13;
&#13;
         í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;&#13;
FV = [                     ]&#13;
         í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Assuming 3 countries (Botswana, Swaziland [indexed S] and RoW) and N sectors, production, value-added&#13;
share and sources of value-added in gross exports are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
X = (I â&#128;&#147; A)-1Y = LY,â&#128;¦&#13;
VAS = VL&#13;
VAS_E = VLE&#13;
&#13;
24Generalization of Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) vertical specialization measure as the this only caputres foreign value added in&#13;
gross exports when only one countryâ&#128;&#153;s intermediate goods are used abroad.&#13;
                                                                                                                              44&#13;
&amp;#12;X and Y are 3í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 1 vectors; A and L are 3í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 3í µí±&#129;; V and VAS are 3 Ã&#151; 3í µí±&#129; matrices; E is a 3í µí±&#129; Ã&#151; 3 and&#13;
VAS_E is 3 Ã&#151; 3.&#13;
&#13;
For aggregate measures, all results continue to hold â&#128;&#147; can be expressed just by replacing relevant&#13;
weighting matrix. Complexity arises from intermediate inputs that cross multiple borders (derivation via&#13;
application of expression for inverse of a partitioned matrix).&#13;
&#13;
As before, value-added shares can be applied to gross exports to produce VAS_E (3 Ã&#151; 3).&#13;
&#13;
         í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;         í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#134; í µí°¸í µí±&#134;â&#136;&#151;   í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151;&#13;
VAS_E = [ í µí±&#137;í µí±&#134; í µí°¿í µí±&#134;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;        í µí±&#137;í µí±&#134; í µí°¿í µí±&#134;í µí±&#134; í µí°¸í µí±&#134;â&#136;&#151;   í µí±&#137;í µí±&#134; í µí°¿í µí±&#134;í µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151; ]&#13;
         í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µâ&#136;&#151;         í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#134;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí±&#134;â&#136;&#151;   í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí±&#133; í µí°¸í µí±&#133;â&#136;&#151;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Here the sum of off-diagonal elements along a column is the measure of foreign value-added embodied&#13;
in a countryâ&#128;&#153;s gross exports, i.e.:&#13;
 í µí°¹í µí±&#137;í µí°µ = â&#136;&#145;í µí°µâ&#137; í µí±&#135; í µí±&#137;í µí±&#135; í µí°¿ í µí±&#135;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µ , or for this 3-coutnry case:&#13;
&#13;
í µí°¹í µí±&#137;í µí°µ = í µí±&#137;í µí±&#134; í µí°¿í µí±&#134;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µ + í µí±&#137;í µí±&#133; í µí°¿í µí±&#133;í µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µ&#13;
&#13;
The sum of off-diagonal elements along a row provides information on a countryâ&#128;&#153;s value-added embodied&#13;
as intermediate inputs in third countriesâ&#128;&#153; gross exports (i.e. indirect value added):&#13;
&#13;
í µí°¼í µí±&#137;í µí°µ = â&#136;&#145;í µí±&#134;â&#137; í µí±&#133; í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí±&#134; í µí°¸í µí±&#134;í µí±&#133; ,&#13;
&#13;
Domestic value in gross exports is, as above:&#13;
&#13;
í µí°·í µí±&#137;í µí°µ = í µí±&#137;í µí°µ í µí°¿í µí°µí µí°µ í µí°¸í µí°µ&#13;
&#13;
Sum of all DV and FV should add up to gross exports&#13;
&#13;
To capture countryâ&#128;&#153;s position (upstream/downstream) it makes sense to compare its exports of&#13;
intermediates used by other countries, with that countryâ&#128;&#153;s use of imported intermediates in the same&#13;
sectors. If it lies upstream in the global value-chain, it participates in producing inputs for others â&#128;&#147; then&#13;
its IV share of gross exports will exceed its FV share:&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             í µí°¼í µí±&#137;í µí°µí µí±&#133; í µí°¹í µí±&#137;í µí°µí µí±&#133;&#13;
                                                   í µí°ºí µí±&#137;í µí°¶_í µí±&#131;í µí±&#142;í µí±&#159;í µí±¡í µí±&#150;í µí±&#144;í µí±&#150;í µí±&#157;í µí±&#142;í µí±¡í µí±&#150;í µí±&#156;í µí±&#155;í µí°µí µí±&#133; =           +&#13;

&amp;#12;Appendix 4: Exports and imports for SACU countries - Comparing Eora and Comtrade&#13;
This section provides an overview of changes in each of the five countryâ&#128;&#153;s aggregate and sectoral exports&#13;
between 2001 and 2011 drawing on the Eora database, as this is the source of the value-added analysis.&#13;
&#13;
For Botswana, the Eora data (Table 11) shows a particularly strong increase in the significance of service&#13;
exports in the economy. While the Other Manufacturing sector (which is likely to include diamonds) was&#13;
the largest in 2001, the two largest export sectors in 2011 were Transport and Hotels and Restaurants.&#13;
Eora data suggests a strong increase in both exports and imports in the given time period, with the former&#13;
growing at almost 11% annually and the latter at over 30%. Besides the Other Manufacturing sector, the&#13;
most important non-services sector is Food and Beverages, which has seen considerable growth (20.8%&#13;
p.a.). In terms of imports, the largest sector is the Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products&#13;
sector, which has also experienced substantial growth since 2001, followed by Electrical and Machinery.&#13;
Financial Intermediation and Business Services is the largest services import sector.&#13;
&#13;
What is most striking when one compares Eora trade data to Comtradeâ&#128;&#153;s data for Botswana (Table 12) is&#13;
the fact that Other Mining and Quarrying, which is by far the largest export sector in Comtrade (more&#13;
than US$8 billion in exports and 15 times as many exports as any other sector) is completely&#13;
underrepresented in Eora, both in terms of trade value and relative significance (it is 6 th with&#13;
approximately 45 million in exports). This discrepancy inevitably skews Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s results for any kind of&#13;
value-added trade analysis. In terms of imports, the overlap is more significant with the EORA Petroleum&#13;
sector aggregated from ISIC sectors 23-27 on Comtrade. Likewise, while Comtrade does not have&#13;
information on the four services sectors featured as top ten imports in Eora (Financial Intermediation and&#13;
Business Services, Public Administration, Education, Health and Other Services and Construction), there is&#13;
an approximate correspondence between some of the other top-ten import sectors if one aggregates&#13;
ISIC sectors to the 26-sector Eora format.&#13;

Lesothoâ&#128;&#153;s top export sector â&#128;&#147; Textiles and Wearing Apparel â&#128;&#147; far exceeds flows from any other goods&#13;
sector according to Eora data (Table 6)(Table 13) with the subsequent sectors predominantly consisting&#13;
of services (most prominently Transport, Public Administration and Hotels and Restaurants). These&#13;
sectors have also grown significantly faster than the textiles and apparel sector. However, the largest&#13;
export sector according to Comtrade, Other Mining and Quarrying, is again far less significant on Eora&#13;
(Table 13) in Eora its approximate equivalent sector, Mining and Quarrying (which also includes four other&#13;
ISIC sectors) has an export volume of approximately US$ 14 million on Eora compared to US$716 million&#13;
for Comtrade.&#13;
&#13;
Eora reports the largest import sectors to be predominantly services (Public Administration, Financial&#13;
Intermediation, and Transport) â&#128;&#147; in all likelihood a product of its dependence on South African imports.&#13;
Leading goods imports are listed as Wholesale Trade (which is not more clearly specified), Electrical and&#13;
Machinery and Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products. Again, the discrepancy to&#13;
Comtrade is rather strikingâ&#128;&#147; here textiles are by far the largest import product, followed â&#128;&#147; more&#13;
consistently with results from the Eora database- by â&#128;&#156;Manufacture of Chemicalsâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;Manufacture of&#13;
Radio and Television.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

&amp;#12;For Namibia, the largest three export sectors according to Eora are Food and Beverages, Petroleum,&#13;
Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products, Mining and Quarrying and Transport (Table 15). Here&#13;
particularly mining and transport have seen remarkable growth over the past years (46% p.a. and 39%&#13;
p.a., respectively, since 2001). Subsequent sectors are primarily manufacturing, including Electrical and&#13;
Machinery, Transport Equipment and Textiles and Wearing Apparel. Comtrade data again has Other&#13;
Mining and Quarrying as the top export sector (Table 9), which broadly reflects the importance of Mining&#13;
and Quarrying in the Eora rankings. The subsequent sectors on Comtrade are Manufacture of Basic&#13;
Metals, Manufacture of Food Products and Manufacture of Coke and Refined Petroleum.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of Namibiaâ&#128;&#153;s imports, the leading imports according to Eora are Electrical and Machinery,&#13;
Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products and Financial Intermediation. Again there is a&#13;
substantial discrepancy to Comtrade, where the leading import is again related to mining (Mining of&#13;
Metal Ores) followed by Manufacture of Machinery and Manufacture of Food Products (which is ranked&#13;
6th according to Eora).&#13;

For South Africa, the largest export sectors according to Eora for 2011 were â&#128;&#147; broadly speaking â&#128;&#147; in mining&#13;
and minerals, including the â&#128;&#152;Other mining productsâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Iron and steel productsâ&#128;&#153;, followed by â&#128;&#152;Coal and&#13;
lignite and non-ferrous metalsâ&#128;&#153; (Table 17). The largest non-mineral-related sector was â&#128;&#152;Transport servicesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
followed by â&#128;&#152;Other business servicesâ&#128;&#153;.25 This mirrors the results in Comtrade (Table 18), where the largest&#13;
sectors were â&#128;&#152;Manufacture of basic metalsâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Mining of metal oresâ&#128;&#153;, followed by â&#128;&#152;Manufacture of&#13;
motor vehiclesâ&#128;&#153;, which likely captures â&#128;&#152;Transport servicesâ&#128;&#153; and the 9th ranked sector, â&#128;&#152;Motor vehicle partsâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
The other top export sectors are either extractives, such as â&#128;&#152;Basic chemical productsâ&#128;&#153; (6th), â&#128;&#152;Petroleum&#13;
productsâ&#128;&#153; (8th) as well as agricultural products (7th). These are all represented in Comtrade as leading&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Among the leading imports, Eoraâ&#128;&#153;s top sectors are â&#128;&#152;Motor vehiclesâ&#128;&#153;, followed by the two services sectors&#13;
â&#128;&#152;General governmentâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Communicationsâ&#128;&#153;, and then â&#128;&#152;Other miningâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Transport servicesâ&#128;&#153;. In&#13;
Comtrade the leading import sector is â&#128;&#152;Extraction of crude petroleumâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Manufacture of machinery&#13;
and equipmentâ&#128;&#153; followed by â&#128;&#152;Manufacture of chemicals and chemical productsâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Manufacture of&#13;
motor vehiclesâ&#128;&#153;. While the ranking differs, both Eora and Comtrade demonstrate the centrality of the&#13;
extractive and transport sectors both as inputs into further production and into final demand.&#13;

25As Eora could draw on South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s own input-output table, there are more sectors available than for the other SACU&#13;
countries. However, the analysis in the subsequent sections draws on the summarized 26-sector summary (25, excluding mining&#13;
and quarrying).&#13;

Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s largest export sectors are Food and Beverages, followed by Electrical and Machinery and&#13;
Transport, Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products and Hotels and Restaurants (Table&#13;
19). Together with Education and Health, both Transport and Hotels and Restaurants have been among&#13;
the fastest growing sectors (up to 50% p.a.), indicative of the increasing importance of the services&#13;
economy. This is broadly consistent with Comtrade data, where Manufacture of Food Products and&#13;
Beverages is the largest sector, ahead of Manufacture of Chemicals and Manufacture of Machinery and&#13;
Equipment. The other goods in Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s list of ten most significant exports on Eora â&#128;&#147; Agriculture, Metal&#13;
Products, Textiles and Wearing Apparel and Wood and Paper â&#128;&#147; are all represented in the top 10 according&#13;
to Comtrade data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   52&#13;
&amp;#12;The largest sources of imports according to Eora are Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral&#13;
Products, Electrical and Machinery and Financial Intermediation. This is followed by two other services&#13;
sectors: Public Administration and Education and Health. When comparing Eora import data for&#13;
Swaziland to Comtrade (Table 20), this does create numerous discrepancies. Comtrade data has&#13;
Manufacture of Motor Vehicles, Manufacture of Chemicals, Manufacture of Textiles and Manufacture of&#13;
Machinery and Equipment as the top goods sectors. As Manufacture of Chemicals is one of four sectors&#13;
subsumed in Eoraâ&#128;&#153;s Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products sector and Transport&#13;
Equipment ranks sixth in the Eora ranking (and third among goods sectors) there is a certain degree of&#13;
overlap, though as before the omission of certain sectors of particular importance in the Comtrade&#13;
rankings (e.g. textiles) is conspicuous.&#13;

As the above analysis shows, there exist substantial discrepancies between Eora and Comtrade, even&#13;
when going beyond sectoral trade volumes and examining just the relative significance of different&#13;
sectors in terms of total imports/exports. Trade data for SACU countries is notoriously flawed so there is&#13;
little guarantee that either source provides an accurate estimate of â&#128;&#152;trueâ&#128;&#153; trade volumes (and initial&#13;
cursory analysis of trade data on the SACU statistical portal provides a further set of contradictions).&#13;
However, the processes required to create the contiguous Eora database have likely come at the expense&#13;
of precision for less globally significant economies, including SACU countries.&#13;
&#13;
In this context, Table 22 through Table 25 provides a helpful overview not only of total non-exported&#13;
output across time for each of the 15 tradable sectors (23 for South Africa as it has a more sophisticated&#13;
IO table), calculated by adding output produced by a sector for use in any domestic sector as an&#13;
intermediate and for domestic final consumption (but not for export), as well as the standard deviation.&#13;
This provides some indication of the reliability of estimates. As can be seen, standard deviations vary&#13;
across sectors, countries, and time26. For example, standard deviations tend to be significantly lower for&#13;
services sectors than for mining and quarrying, while the level of uncertainty for Swaziland (over 60% for&#13;
2000 values and 30% for 2011) is far in excess of those of the other four SACU countries, where in&#13;
aggregate the standard deviation tends to be range from a fraction of 1% (South Africa) to 5% of the&#13;
result (Namibia and Lesotho). For each country adherence reports are available describing in greater&#13;
detail which data sources have been respected most and least in the final outcome.&#13;

scores to these. Then, â&#128;&#156;conflicting data points along with quality scores are run through optimization software which produces a&#13;
quality-weighted result.â&#128;&#157; If two conflicting estimates exist, the researchers first ascertaine â&#128;&#147; either from written documentation,&#13;
or from data source provider interviews â&#128;&#147; the reliability of the data source, and then assign standard deviations to the two or&#13;
more values, with the optimiser then producing a quality-weighted final result.&#13;

            SACU in global value chains : measuring GVC
            integration, position, and performance of Botswana, Lesotho,
            Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Once concentrated among a few large
            economies, global flows of goods, services, and capital now
            reach an ever larger number of economies worldwide. Global
            trade in goods and services increased 10 times between 1980
            and 2011, while FDI flows increased almost 30-fold. The
            sales from foreign-owned firms amount to $26 trillion. As
            many as 3,000 bilateral investment treaties have been signed
            to create the framework of deep agreements needed not only
            to facilitate the global movement of final goods and
            services but also to internationalize entire processes of
            production. All these flows have grown over time, creating
            increasingly dense and complex networks. This note is
            intended provide an overview of SACU countries’
            participation and performance in GVCs, drawing on several
            data sources and indicators, and most importantly the
            recently released 189-country Eora multi-region-input-output
            (MRIO) database (Lenzen et al. 2012, 2013). Following this
            introduction, the note is structured in five additional
            sections. Section two discusses in greater detail the scope
            of the report, including the data sources and methodological
            approaches, as well as their respective limitations. Section
            three looks at structural integration in trade, including
            the degree to which SACU countries import and export
            intermediates. Section four analyzes trends in value-added
            exports as a first step in exploring GVC participation.
            Section five hones in on the core measures of GVC
            participation and a brief analysis of SACU countries’
            position in GVCs. Finally, section six concludes by bringing
            together the main findings from the analysis.
