ABSTRACT&#13;
Within the framework of a four-sector macroeconomic&#13;
statics are used to assess alternative ways of macroeconomic adjustment in&#13;
the Thai economy. Fiscal policy interventions, manipulations of the exchange&#13;
rate and productivity improvements are discussed. Their implications in&#13;
terms of income generation, external deficit and inflation are derived. It&#13;
is shown that only productivity improvemerts have positive effects on all&#13;
indicators. Fiscal interventions lead to an improvement in the external&#13;
deficit, but at the cost of income generation. The outcome of a devaluation&#13;
is largely dependent on the behavior of fector prices.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The present study has been prepared as a background pape-r for the&#13;
preparation of a structural adjustment loan to Thailand. As such, its purpose&#13;
is to shed light on the macroeconomic implications of alternative packages of&#13;
policy measures and of other changes which might affect the Thai economy.&#13;
Results reported here are part of the materials produced in the&#13;
process of preparation of the package of recommendations associated with the&#13;
structural adjustment loan.&#13;
In another respect, this study is part of an ongoing prcject on the&#13;
macroeconomic behavior of the Thai economy.    It is a follow-up on a&#13;
previous paper on "Aggregate Demand and Macroeconomic Imbalances in&#13;
Thailand". 1/ Methodologically, the two papers follow the same approach and&#13;
use the same macroeconomic model: SIAM1. However, the present paper uses a&#13;
slightly modified version. 2/ It has also been prepared, contrary to the&#13;
first one, in the aftermath of the second oil price shock, and thus benefited&#13;
from a deeper historical perspective, and from a preliminary comparison of the&#13;
effects of the two oil price shocks.&#13;
Indeed, due mainly to poor agricultural performance and to the oil&#13;
price increases, the GDP growth rate in Thailand dropped from 9.4% in 1973 to&#13;
5.4% in 1974. A second oil price hike, also associated in 1979 with a weak&#13;
agricultural performance contributed to a similar slowing-down of the&#13;
economy. From 10.1% in 1978 the rate of growth dropped to 6.5% in 1979 and&#13;
the further increases in oil prices of. 1980 contributed to maintain it at&#13;
1/ See W. Grais (1981), "Aggregate Demand1 and Macroeconomic Imbalances in&#13;
Thailand: Simulations with the SIAM1 Model," World Bank Staff Working&#13;
Paper No. 448. The version of the model used here is slightly different.&#13;
2/ A brief description of the two versions of SIAM1 is given in Section II.&#13;

around 6%. Between the two oil price shocks, from 1975 to 1978, an&#13;
impressively highly growth was achieved with an average rate of 8.5%. Thus,&#13;
the contractionary effects of high energy costs did actually occur in&#13;
Thailand; they were followed, after the first round of price increases, by a&#13;
recovery period.&#13;
The oil price increases, though contractionary, were also&#13;
inflationary, and this type of pressure did not spare Thailand. The consumer&#13;
price index rose by 5% in 1972, by 15% in 1973 and by 24% in 1974;&#13;
subsequently in 1975, its increase slowed down to 5%. The same pattern&#13;
occurred during the second round of oil price increases. From an 8% increase&#13;
in 1978, there was an acceleration in the increase of the CPI to 19% in 1979&#13;
and to 20% in 1980. Inflationary pressures, therefore, seem to follow similar&#13;
patterns.&#13;
While similarities exist between the two oil price shocks in terms&#13;
of the general level of activity and of inflation, the response in terms of&#13;
external balance is rather different (see Figure 1). Indeed, the first oil&#13;
price shock hardly had an efffect on the current account deficit. The&#13;
latter's share in GDP between 1972 and 1974 was stable around .6%. 1!/ A&#13;
similar stability was not maintained subsequently to the second oil price&#13;
shock. From 5% of GDP in 1978 to current account deficit increased to 7.6% in&#13;
1979 and remained at approximately this evel in 1980. In terms of size, the&#13;
current account deficit nearly doubled between 1978 and 1979 from US $1.2&#13;
billion to US $2.1 billion and increased slightly to US $2.4 billion in&#13;
1980. However, by focussing only on the two oil price shocks, one overlooks&#13;
1/ The share of oil imports in total imports, however, increased from 11% in&#13;
1973 to 20% in 1974. This was much cushioned by the dramatic increase in&#13;
export prices (53% between 1972 and 1973, and 38% between 1973 and 1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

the development of the external balance between 1975 and 1978. During this&#13;
period the current account deficits were substantially higher than cluring the&#13;
perious period. In fact, from 1972 to 1974 the share of the current: account&#13;
deficit in GDP was around .6%, whereas from 1975 to 1978 it was much higher at&#13;
4.4% on average. The large deficits occurring between 1975 and 197B can be&#13;
only marginally attributed to oil prices. lhey were due either to a bad&#13;
performance of agricultural exports (1975) or a general deterioration in the&#13;
terms of trade and to a boom in investment which then took place (]977). By&#13;
and large, Thailand escaped the potential external difficulties of the first&#13;
oil price shock because of soaring export prices. However, the subsequent&#13;
deterioration of the terms of trade and a booming economy left the balance of&#13;
payments in a vulnerable situation. The sEcond oil price increases confirmed&#13;
this vulnerability and further increased the current account deficits.&#13;

Thailand was thus able to survive the first oil price shock without&#13;
major difficulty because export prices cushioned to a large extent the impact&#13;
of the oil price increases. The relative absence of external imbalance did&#13;
not point to the need for structural adjustment to the higher energy costs.&#13;
However, Thailand is now faced with the question of how to contain and&#13;
eventually improve the external balance and the overall savings gap without&#13;
cutting dramatically the rate of expansion of the economy. In the following,&#13;
we try to assess to what extent the growth rate and the macroeconomic balance&#13;
are sensitive to changes in the environment of the economy, to policy&#13;
interventions and to structural changes.&#13;
Following the introduction, the paper is divided into five sections&#13;
and a conclusion. In section III, the consequences of changes in the&#13;
environment in the absence of policy intervention are considered.    Section IV&#13;
assesses the implications of policy intervention in the absence of any change&#13;
in the environment of the economy. In section V, a selected number of policy&#13;
interventions and of changes in the environment are combined and the&#13;
implications drawn. Finally, structural changes are considered in section&#13;
VI. The conclusion discusses the relative contributions of the various&#13;
changes to the adjustment of the economy and their relevance for policy&#13;
intervention.&#13;
II. THE FRAMEWORK OF ANALYSIS&#13;
1. The Model&#13;
The sensitivity of the macroeconomic behavior of the economy to&#13;
various changes is analyzed within the framework of the SIAM1 model of&#13;
Thailand. It is a four-sector (agriculture, industry, energy and services)&#13;
model which is macroeconomically investment driven with savings and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5-&#13;
current account deficit adjusting.   It is also a fix-price model where supply&#13;
adjusts to demand to close markets. This presumes that the economy is not&#13;
working at full capacity; we believe that this is not an unreasonable&#13;
assumption given that in the second half of the seventies an investment boom&#13;
took place and that the economy has subsequently slowed down. Flexibility of&#13;
supply is, however, not assumed for agriculture. In this sector an [nelastic&#13;
supply is postulated and agricultural growth is exogenously given.&#13;
Agricultural exports adjust to clear the marlcet.&#13;
SIAMI is a fix-price model and prices are determined independently&#13;
of quantities. In agriculture the world price of exports determines the&#13;
domestic price as well as the value-added price; in the other sectors, the&#13;
value added prices are given, reflecting the domestic cost-push factors&#13;
contributing to inflation. World import and export prices are given&#13;
exogenously and the nominal exchange rate is fixed. Domestic inflation is&#13;
thus determined essentially by the growth of value-added prices in the&#13;
nonagricultural sectors, the world export price of agricultural goods and the&#13;
world import prices. The differences in the! rates of growth of these&#13;
variables determines the inflation rate of the domestic economy relative to&#13;
that of the world economy, the terms of trade and the competitiveness of the&#13;
economy.&#13;
The version of the SIAM1 used in t:his paper differs from the one in&#13;
Grais (1981) in three respects. First, in the previous version, gcvernment&#13;
current outlays are linked more directly to government revenues. Thus any&#13;
increase in the latter would feed directly into the former. The government on&#13;
the current account was not allowed to have a deficit. The budget deficit&#13;
would only be due to excessive government capital expenditure. In the present&#13;
version of SIAM1, government current expenditure in current prices is assumed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6-&#13;
exogenous and used as a policy instrument with the possibility of having&#13;
negative government savings. The second difference between the two versions&#13;
of SIAMI is the introduction of the nominal exchange rate as an explicit&#13;
exogenous variable. Though it is still a fixed exchange rate model-&#13;
simulations of exchange rate manipulations are now possible. The last&#13;
modification is the updating of the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) underlying&#13;
the model. The first version was based on a SAM for 1975, whereas the present&#13;
one uses a SAM built with preliminary data of 1980. Thus the structure 1/ of&#13;
the model used here is a 1980 structure.&#13;
2. Desgign of Experiments and Reference Simulation&#13;
We consider there are three types of changes which can influence the&#13;
macroeconomic path of the economy: changes in the environment, changes in&#13;
policies and structural changes. The path which the economy will follow is&#13;
likely to be the outcome of a combination of all these changes. An attempt to&#13;
track such a path by identifying the combined changes which are likely to&#13;
occur seem to be an impossible task and one which is not worth pursuing.&#13;
Indeed, we are not trying to produce macroeconomic forecasts, but rather to&#13;
assess the macroeconomic implications of exogenous changes and, in particular,&#13;
of policy intervention. It seems, therefore, more appropriate to try to&#13;
disentangle the separate impacts of changes in the environment, in policies&#13;
and in structure. As a result, the experiments are designed in order to&#13;
capture:&#13;
1/ A structure is defined here as the set of values taken by the&#13;
technological and behavioral parameters governing the economy. Thus the&#13;
values taken by the input/output coefficients, by the marginal&#13;
propensities to spend, by different import and export shares and&#13;
elasticities define the structure of the economy. For further details see&#13;

(1)    the consequences of changes in the environment in thea absence&#13;
of policy interventions;&#13;
(2)    the consequences of policy irntervention in the absence of&#13;
changes in the environment;&#13;
(3)    the consequences of a combination of both changes in the&#13;
environment and in policies;&#13;
(4)    how structural changes could enhance the improvement of the&#13;
external balance and/or growth.&#13;
In order to assess the consequences; of various exogenous changes,&#13;
however, it is necessary to draw a reference path of the economy which these&#13;
changes would alter. Such a path is presented in Table 1. We would like to&#13;
stress that Table 1 does not present projections but only the outcome, within&#13;
the framework of the model, of the postulated assumptions on the exogenous&#13;
variables. The main assumptions underlying the reference path are the&#13;
following:&#13;
(1)    annual growth of agriculture production:   3.1%&#13;
(2)    annual growth of investment in constant prices:    6.7%&#13;
(3)    domestic inflation slightly lower than world inflat[on;&#13;
(4)    a slow-down in the growth of government current consumption;&#13;
(5)    all policy parameters are left at their 1980 values;&#13;
(6)    nonprice-induced growth of nonagricultural exports:    11.5%&#13;
Under these assumptions the growth of GDP would slow down to 6.8%;&#13;
private consumption would, on the other hand, continue to grow at the same&#13;
rate as in the period 1976-1980. Rates of growth of exports and imports would&#13;
both drop, the drop being larger for the latter. This would allow the re-&#13;
source gap, as a percentage of GDP to fall from 4.9% in 1982 to 4.5% in&#13;
1986. A similar, though larger, reduction in the share of the current account&#13;
deficit in GDP would also take place; however, in absolute terms the deficit&#13;
would increase from 63.5 billion bahts in 1982 to 108.9 billion bahts in&#13;

1986. Government revenues as a share of GDP would slightly increase to 14.9%&#13;
while government current expenditure would, after an initial slowdown, fall,&#13;
by 1986, to its 1980 share in GDP.&#13;
According to this reference path, without further policy&#13;
intervention and tnder the chosen conservative assumptions about investment,&#13;
agricultural and export performances, the growth of the economy would slow&#13;
down during the period of the fifth five-year plan. However, the improvement&#13;
in the external balance and the overall savings gap would be rather limited.&#13;
III. CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT POLICY INTERVENTION&#13;
Changes in the environment are first identified with the&#13;
corresponding changes in the variables of the model. We then proceed to&#13;
illustrate how such changes in the framework of the model affect the growth of&#13;
the economy and the macroeconomic balance.&#13;
Thailand is a relatively small open economyl! which exert, little&#13;
influence on the prices of either its imported or exported goods. 2/1 These&#13;
prices, as well as world demand for Thai exports, are definitely part of the&#13;
environment of the economy, and condition to some extent its development&#13;
path. In another respect, the Thai economy is still dominated by agriculture&#13;
which plays an important role in the trade balance, in income generation and&#13;
in employment; however, agricultural growth is highly dependent on climatic&#13;
conditions and on land availability. For these reasons and in a medium-run&#13;
perspective, it seems reasonable to consider the performance of agriculture as&#13;
largely determined by the environment. The extent to which investment is part&#13;

26% and 18.3% respectively.&#13;

of the environment and, hence, exogenous is rather controversial: Government&#13;
and public investment can reasonably be considered exogenous; private&#13;
investment is probably related in one way or another to profitability and&#13;
demand variations. A careful analysis of investment behavior is, nonetheless,&#13;
needed to affirm such relations. Due to lack of data, to the absence of a&#13;
readily available explanation for investment behavior in Thailand, and to the&#13;
role of "animal spirits" in the determination of investment, we have taken&#13;
here the stance of considering investment "as part of the environment" and,&#13;
hence, exogenous. This is also the stance taken with respect to the balance&#13;
of factor incomes, and is motivated by the uncertainty regarding the eventual&#13;
trend in workers remittances. A rapid increase in remittances would slow down&#13;
the growth in the deficits of the balance of factor incomes and help in&#13;
improving the current account deficit.&#13;
1. Export Price of Agricultural Goods&#13;
During the first oil price hike, a large disequilibrium in the trade&#13;
balance did not develop in Thailand because of dramatic increases in export&#13;
prices. This did not happen again in 1979/80. However, there is always the&#13;
eventuality of a tight food situation in the world which would send food&#13;
prices rising again. Such a development would show up in a higher rate of&#13;
growth of the export price of agricultural goods. Table 2 presents the&#13;
implications on growth and on the macroeconomic balance of an increase in&#13;
export prices of agricultural goods of (1) 10% (reference path); (2) 13% (high&#13;
export prices); and (3) 7% (low export prices). The main outcome is that an&#13;
almost doubling of the rate of growth of agricultural export prices has hardly&#13;
any effect on growth while it has a very substantial effect on the behavior of&#13;

the resource gap. The economy would adjust as follows. 1/ An increase in the&#13;
world price would drive up the domestic price of agricultural goods which in&#13;
turn would induce higher inflation. 2 This would exert a slight downward&#13;
pressure on the rate of growth because of three factors:&#13;
(a) Higher domestic prices induce a loss of competitiveness of the&#13;
economy; exports of industrial goods and services suffer and&#13;
aggregate demand weakens.&#13;
(b)  Higher domestic prices3/ induce a shift of demand from domestically&#13;
produced goods towards imports and this has an adverse effect on&#13;
aggregate demand.&#13;
(c)  When the growth of government current consumption is planned in&#13;
current prices, higher inflation means that its real rate of growth&#13;
will be lower. The growth of aggregate demand is slowed down.&#13;
The slower growth of aggregate demand because of the fixed supply in&#13;
agriculture leaves a larger agricultural surplus to be exported. The effect&#13;
on agricultural exports dominates the downward pressure on other exports and&#13;
total exports grow faster.&#13;
High agricultural export prices induce higher rates of growth of&#13;
exports and imports. Comparing the growth in trade when export prices are&#13;
increasing at 13% and at 7%, the difference between the rates of growth of&#13;
exports and imports is larger in the latter case. In spite of that,&#13;
1/ The adjustment described depends on the assumption that world prices of&#13;
agricultural goods determine domestic prices in agriculture, and that&#13;
investment is exogenous.&#13;
2/ Prices of value added in industry, energy and services are exogenous.&#13;
3/ The nominal exchange rate is fixed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
relatively to GDP, the resource gap improves dramatically in the first case&#13;
and worsens in the second. This is due to the implied development in the&#13;
external terms of trade. When the agricultural export price grows by 13%, the&#13;
terms of trade drop by less than 1% between 1980 and 1986, while whEn it grows&#13;
by 7%, they drop by more than 20% (see Table 3).&#13;

These simulations illustrate the crucial importance of the terms of&#13;
trade. In the second half of the seventies, inspite of the relatively good&#13;
performance in the quantities of exports andl imports, the deterioration in the&#13;
terms of trade contributed a great deal to the widening of the rescurce gap.&#13;
An issue Thailand faces now is that of how to overcome further deteriorations&#13;
in the terms of trade. One way is to push export quantities as much as&#13;
possible while containing imports, the emphasis being put on high export&#13;
growth. Another possibility is to restructure trade by promoting export&#13;
activities the prices of which are likely to soar and by import substituting&#13;
away from high cost imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. Investment Growth&#13;
Let us consider variations in the rates of growth of investment 1/&#13;
(see Table 4). The assumed growth in the reference path is 6.7%; if it is&#13;
slowed down say to 5.6%, this would lead to a slowdown of aggregate demand&#13;
and, in a demand-driven world, of GDP. However, the drop in the growth rate&#13;
of GDP is cushioned by the fact that agricultural growth is exogenous. This&#13;
latter feature, together with the slowing down of the economy, would leave a&#13;
larger agricultural surplus for exports which would grow faster. The slowdown&#13;
would also induce a lower growth of imports. If however, investment growth is&#13;
pushed up to 7.6%, aggregate demand would also increase faster and GDP would&#13;
reach a rate of growth of 7%. Because no change in agricultural production&#13;
takes place, the agricultural exportable surplus is reduced and the growth of&#13;
exports slows down. The higher growth of GDP, however, induces a higher&#13;
growth of imports. Although the higher growth of investment generates more&#13;
incomes and allows private consumption to grow at 5.7%, it leads also, in the&#13;
absence of any other intervention in the economy, to a worsening of the exter-&#13;
nal balance. As a percentage of GDP, the resource gap and the current account&#13;
deficit would reach 5.3% and 7.4%, respectively', in 1986. With an investment&#13;
growth of 5.6% the resource gap would be reduced to 3.1% of GDP in 1986, and&#13;
the current account deficit would reach 5.2% in the same year. It follows&#13;
that in the absence of any intervention in the economy, a cut in the rate of&#13;
growth of investment would be necessary in order to improve the external&#13;
balance. Yet, even in this case, the share of the current account deficit in&#13;
GDP would not drop below 5% by 1986.&#13;
1/ There is no feedback in the model from investment to the production&#13;
capacity.&#13;

3. Agricultural Growth&#13;
Would a 4.4% growth rate of agricultural production, in and of&#13;
itselfl/, allow the economy to grow rapidly and reduce its external deficit?&#13;
It would certainly show a more attractive path than if agriculture production&#13;
were to grow only at 2% a year (see Table 5). In this latter case, GDP growth&#13;
would drop by 1% point below the historically achieved rate of the period&#13;
1976-1980. Furthermore, this would lead to a reduction of the agricultural&#13;
exportable surplus and slow down the rate of growth of exports. A slowdown of&#13;
agriculture would, in turn, contribute to a worsening of the resource gap and&#13;
of the current account deficit which would reach 6% and 8.2% of GDP,&#13;
respectively, in 1986. Indeed, slower agricultural growth means, on the one&#13;
hand, lower agricultural incomes which would drive down aggregate demand and&#13;
growth and, on the other hand, a smaller agricultural surplus available for&#13;
exports. The effect on the trade balance is very damaging-/ while the GDP&#13;
growth would be low by Thai standards but still reasonable. Would these&#13;
pessimistic results be altered if agriculture were to maintain an average rate&#13;
of growth of 4.4%? This would channel higher agricultural incomes and create&#13;
a large surplus for exports. GDP growth would reach 7.5%, almost the rate&#13;
achieved on the period 1976-1980. Exports also would grow faster than in the&#13;
reference path. Though imports would also accelerate because of the higher&#13;
overall growth, the resource gap and the current account deficit would&#13;
experience relative improvement. By 1986, the resource gap would reach 3.3%&#13;
of GDP while the current account deficit would still be at about 5.3%. It&#13;
follows, therefore, that a good agricultural performance would contribute&#13;
1/. Without extra investment.&#13;
2/ Though imports grow slower.&#13;

considerably to maintaining a high rate of growth of the economy, but would&#13;
not on its own dramatically reduce the external balance.&#13;
4. Growth of Exports&#13;
The rate of growth of developing countries is linked to the rate of&#13;
growth of industrialized countries through the exports of the former to the&#13;
latter. The uncertainty with respect to the eventual growth of industrialized&#13;
countries and the potential for intradeveloping countries trade, as suggested&#13;
by W. A. Lewis1/, justify an inquiry into the effects of alternative paths for&#13;
industrial and services exports of Thailand. These can grow either because&#13;
world demand is strong or because Thai exporters are particularly efficient&#13;
both in production and marketing. In Table 6 we have assumed that the&#13;
nonprice factors would contribute to shifts of the demand functions for Thai&#13;
exports2/ at either 14.5% or 8.5% a year. A sustained growth of industrial&#13;
and service exports implies a sustained aggregate demand and an overall high&#13;
rate of growth of GDP. This, of course, induces a higher growth rate of&#13;
imports, but it lags far behind that of exports. As can then be expected, the&#13;
resource gap and current account deficit improve relatively reaching 3.1% and&#13;
5.2% of GDP, repectively, by 1986. Unfortunately, these rates are still&#13;
relatively high and demonstrates that even a high export performance cannot,&#13;
by itself, contribute to a dramatic improvement in the external balance;&#13;
however, this does not mean that export growth does not matter. This point is&#13;
illustrated by the low export growth scenario of Table 6. Indeed, a&#13;
slowingdown in the growth of industrial and services exports would slowdown&#13;
GDP growth, but it would also lead to a worsening of the external balance.&#13;

Economic Review, June.&#13;

The resource gap in 1986 would increase to 5.8% of GDP while the current&#13;
account deficit would reach 8%.&#13;
The two preceding simulations point out the sensitivity of the&#13;
macroeconomic aggregates to the performance of nonagricultural exports. They&#13;
stress the importance of efforts directed at promoting industrial and services&#13;
exports. And finally, they show that a better export performance alone cannot&#13;
be depended on to substantially improve the macroeconomic balance.&#13;
5. The Balance of Factor Incomes&#13;
Another aspect of the balance of payments which generates some&#13;
concern is the balance of factor incomes; it has become increasingly negative&#13;
in the recent past: and the deficit is likely to grow. However, favorable&#13;
developments in workers' remittances might s:Low down the widening of the&#13;
deficit and help lessen the difference between domestic and national&#13;
savings. The outcomes of two developments oE the balance of factor incomes-&#13;
are presented in Table 7. A higher deficit Df the balance of factor incomes&#13;
means a higher transfer from the domestically generated income to the rest of&#13;
the world. Less is left to be distributed to domestic institutions and&#13;
households in particular and, hence, aggregate demand is bound to be lower.&#13;
In a demand-driven framework growth would also be slower.&#13;
Although differences in rates of growth are not large, such a&#13;
pattern is what appears in Table 7. An interesting point is the behavior of&#13;
the current accotnt deficit and of the resource gap relative to GDP between&#13;
1982 and 1986. A faster growing deficit of the balance of factor incomes&#13;
1/  Net factor income from abroad is added to GDP at factor cost to form GNP&#13;
at factor cost which is then distributed to households and other&#13;
institutions.&#13;

(25%) reduces the rate of growth of GDP. 1/ Because agricultural growth does&#13;
not change, a larger agricultural surplus for exports shows and exports grow&#13;
faster. At the same time, however, imports a:Lso grow at a lower rate since&#13;
overall growth is slower. This shows an improvement in the resource gap which&#13;
moves from 5.2% of GDP in 1982, to 4.2% in 1986. Meanwhile, due to a rapid&#13;
increase in the deficit in the balance of factor incomes, the share of the&#13;
current account deficit in GDP increases. The improvement in the resource gap&#13;
is not sufficient to compensate for the worserning of the balance of factor&#13;
incomes. When the deficit in the balance of factor incomes grows at a slower&#13;
rate, the share of the current account deficit in GDP improves instead of&#13;
worsens, while the decline in the share of the resource gap is less pronounced&#13;
than before.&#13;
Overall, within the range of figures considered for the deficit of&#13;
the balance of factor incomes, developments in this realm do not seem to&#13;
influence tremendously either growth or the share of the current account&#13;
deficit in GDP. However, they could have more than negligible effects on the&#13;
resource gap. Though there would be no need to worry too much about the&#13;
behavior of the balance of factor incomes, it seems preferable to monitor it&#13;
and to keep track of the indirect effects, especially on the resource gap.&#13;
If one is to compare the individual changes considered above and&#13;
rank them in terms of their contribution to growth and to the improvement of&#13;
the external balance, the high export performance seems to be more&#13;
attractive.   Indeed, it allows an overall growth of 7.5% and an improvement in&#13;
the external balance. In 1986 the resource galp reaches 3.1% of GDP, and the&#13;
share of the current account deficit drops to :;.2%. The cut in investment&#13;

growth produces the same outcome in terms of the external balance, but at the&#13;
cost of a substantial slowdown in the growth of GDP. A high performance of&#13;
agricultural production leads to results close to those obtained with high&#13;
export growth. The external balance, however, improves slightly less.&#13;
6. Combined Changes in the Environment&#13;
Now let tus compare the reference path with a more optimistic view&#13;
where a selected number of the positive changes in the environment considered&#13;
above are combined together. A recovering world market would allow industrial&#13;
and service exports to grow rapidly and appropriate climatic conditions and&#13;
agricultural transformation would lead to a 4.4% growth in agricultural&#13;
production and a higher investment growth. The assumption of no policy&#13;
intervention is still maintained. The question then considered is whether&#13;
favorable developments in the environment can on their own induce both a&#13;
higher growth rate and an improvement in the macroeconomic balance. Results&#13;
are presented in Table 8. The positive effect of higher growth of aggregate&#13;
demand (exports and investment) and of agricultural production oln GDP growth&#13;
is obvious.  The economy achieves an impressive growth rate (8.2%), higher&#13;
than that obtained in the period 1976-1980, or produced for the reference&#13;
path. The growth in private consumption accelerates reaching 6.8%, because&#13;
public current consumption and investment grows slower than before; of course,&#13;
the high performance of the economy induces a higher growth of imports than in&#13;

the reference path. 1/  Furthermore, an exportable agricultural surplus is&#13;
still available and total exports can grow faster due to rapid growth of&#13;
production. This combination of favorable developments in the eavironment&#13;
engenders an impressive growth, and also leacls to an improvement of the&#13;
external balance; in fact, the resource gap c[rops to 2% of GDP by 1986, while&#13;
the current account deficit reaches 4% of GDP. Another outcome is the&#13;
improvement in the share of the government savings (on the current account);&#13;
because public consumption is growing at the same rate both in the reference&#13;
and high growth path (7.8%), the share of the current government expenditure&#13;
in GDP remains lower in the latter path. The absence of any policy&#13;
intervention, occurring simultaneously with increase government revenues does&#13;
not change the revenues share in GDP; consequently, the savings share&#13;
increases.&#13;
Overall, favorable developments in the export and agricultural&#13;
performances would substantially boost the growth rate of the economy. They&#13;
would also contribute to the improvement of both the external and public&#13;
components of the macroeconomic balance. The current account deficit,&#13;
however, would still be at 4% of GDP by 1986, which is only slightly lower&#13;
than the average obtained between 1975 and 1978 (4.4%) and which was&#13;
considered relatively high.&#13;
IV. POLICY INTERVENTION WITHOUT CHANGES IN'IHE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
In the previous section, "nature" was supposed to create the&#13;
conditions for the macroeconomic adjustment of the economy. Government was&#13;
1/ The elasticity of imports with respect to GDP appears to be, both in the&#13;
reference and high growth paths, approximately half (.75) that obtained&#13;
for the period 1976-1980 (1.5). Explanations for this lower elasticity&#13;
are the coming on stream of gas production and the induced substitution of&#13;
imported energy by domestic energy and also the lower growth of&#13;
investment.&#13;

supposed to remain mainly passive, thereby letting things develop&#13;
independently. How then would the growth of the economy and the macroeconomic&#13;
balance behalf if no changel! in the environment takes place but the&#13;
government implements fiscal policies, or changes the exchange rate.&#13;
1. Marginal Changes in Policy Instruments&#13;
1.1 Fiscal Policy Instruments&#13;
In order to get some feel for the response of the economy to&#13;
alternative fiscal policy measures, we have computed the elasticities of&#13;
selected aggregate indicators with respect to various policy instruments.&#13;
These elasticities are presented in Table 9. They measure the direct and&#13;
indirect effects of a marginal change of the particular policy&#13;
instrument. 2/ The various instruments are given in columns whereas the&#13;
target variables are presented in rows. The sum of a row, or of particular&#13;
elements of a row, gives the total effect of a combination of policy&#13;
measures. Column 13 presents the combined effects of the instruments of&#13;
columns 1 to 5, while column 14 describes the combined effects of all the&#13;
considered instruments.&#13;
In the face of a large resource gap, the following policies might be&#13;
contemplated: (1) a cut in absorption through increased taxation and a&#13;
reduction in government current consumption; (2) increased protection through&#13;
higher tariffs; (3) export promotion through export subsidization; and (4) a&#13;
devaluation. Column 1 presents the percentage changes induced by a 1%&#13;
1/ Relative to the reference path. See underlying assumptions descibed in&#13;
para. 2.&#13;
2/ These elasticities are not constant due to the nonlinearity of the&#13;
model. They describe the changes with respect to a particular point on a&#13;
given path. Here they are computed for the reference path and for the&#13;
year 1985.&#13;

decrease in government current consumption; the measure is, of course,&#13;
contractionary as is evident by all the negative signs in the column. The&#13;
sector most affected by the decrease is services which is understandable in&#13;
view of its large share in government consumption; imports also slow down; and&#13;
the general contraction of the economy leaves a larger agricultural surplus&#13;
thus causing agricultural exports to increase. The improvement in the&#13;
resource gap induces a subtantial amelioration of the current account&#13;
deficit. Accordingly, an interesting aspect is the induced decline in the net&#13;
indirect taxes and in government revenue; percentage-wise, however, it is much&#13;
lower than the decrease in government current consumption. Overall a 1%&#13;
decrease in government current consumption would lead to a drop in GDP of&#13;
approximately .2%, but also to an improvement in the current account deficit&#13;
of almost 2%. Increases in tax rates on domestically-produced energy and in&#13;
tariff rates on imported energy have similar effects on GDP and on the current&#13;
account deficit as a reduction in government current expenditure, but the&#13;
elasticities are much lower indicating a more removed linkage. A different&#13;
result is obtained in terms of government revenue and collection of indirect&#13;
taxes. Indeed, increased taxation of energy induces higher revenues for the&#13;
government.    Its depressing effect on the economy is not strong enough to&#13;
depress these revenues. The increased taxation of energy slows down the&#13;
imports of energy and the imports of agriculturei,/ however, it drives up&#13;
domestic prices of industrial goods and of services and, through substitution,&#13;
imports of these items increase. Finally, because the GDP is depressed&#13;
without change in agriculture production, agricultural exports increase.&#13;
1/ The domestic price of agriculture is determined by the world price of&#13;
agricultural exports and the export tax rate; hence, it is independent of&#13;
other domestic prices. The slowdown of GDP will thus slow down&#13;
agricultural imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Heavier taxation of households and of corporations produces similar results to&#13;
those obtained through a reduction in government current consumption. The&#13;
only exception is that it leads to higher government revenue although indirect&#13;
tax collection drops. Combining the five preceding policy interventions would&#13;
produce the results presented in column 13: it constitutes a package of&#13;
measures which cut absorption, and improve government revenue and the current&#13;
account deficit. If prices are rigid downwards, as it is assumed in the&#13;
model, a higher CPI will also be obtained.&#13;
Another type of policy intervention which would eventually lead to&#13;
an improvement of the resource gap is increased protection. Column 9&#13;
describes the effect of a 1% increase in the tariff on imports of industrial&#13;
goods. Such a tariff raises the prices of imports relative to those of&#13;
domestically produced goods and induces demand to shift from imports to&#13;
domestic goods. This, in turn, leads to higher aggregate demand and, hence,&#13;
higher incomes which is reflected in the positive effect on GDP. Higher&#13;
tariffs on industrial goods would depress industrial imports but increase&#13;
imports of other items due to the stronger aggregate demand which would itself&#13;
lead to a decrease in agricultural exports as agricultural supply remains the&#13;
same. Other exports would also decline butt this is due to the inflationary&#13;
effect of higher tariffs causing a loss of competitiveness. Nonetheless, on&#13;
balance, as shown by the elasticity of the current account deficit, with&#13;
respect to the import tariff (.307), increased protection improves the&#13;
external balance; it also increases GDP. If prices were flexible, the&#13;
increased demand would drive up domestic prices; eventually the GDP increase&#13;
would be smaller and the effects on both exports and imports would be&#13;
dampened; however, to the extent that industrial prices are not flexible,&#13;
which is likely at least in the short run, and that there is some slack in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
capacity utilization, increased protection would produce both higher incomes&#13;
and improvement in the current account.&#13;
One way of promoting exports is to subsidize them in the hope that&#13;
this will contribute to the improvement of the resource gap. Column 12 shows&#13;
how a 1% variation in the export tax would affect the major macroeconomic&#13;
indicators. It indicates that a 1% decrease in the tax would indeed&#13;
contribute to an improvement in the current account deficit, but very&#13;
marginally: .005%. The positive effect on GDP would also be very marginal.&#13;
Besides the fact that direct subsidization of exports is not a very welcomed&#13;
measure from the GATT point of view, it can also be considered as a kind of&#13;
transfer abroad. Furthermore, it adversely affects government revenues. In&#13;
fact when its real marginal effect on GDP and on the current account is taken&#13;
into account, subsidization of exports does not seem to be the most&#13;
appropriate measure to implement.&#13;
1.2 Manipulation of the Exchange Rate&#13;
Consider now how a devaluation can contribute to the adjustment of&#13;
the economy. In order to capture this adjustment a few preliminary remarks&#13;
are needed.&#13;
The value of the baht is in principle fixed with reference to a pool&#13;
of other currencies. In practice, for a long time, the exchange rate between&#13;
the baht and the US dollar was relatively fixed varying around 20 bahts for a&#13;
dollar. Thus, when the dollar was depreciating against European currencies&#13;
and the yenl/, the baht was following. In the first part of 1981, however,&#13;
the dollar appreciated substantially vis-a-vis European currencies and the-&#13;
yen. In the beginning the baht followed, but later, due to an aggravating&#13;

U.S., and the European Economic Community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Column 1 of Table 10 presents the results of a 1% devaluation.&#13;
These results are obtained under the assumption that the prices of value added&#13;
do not change which means that nominal factor prices r;emain constant. The&#13;
devaluation amounts to a 1% increase in the world price of exports and in&#13;
import prices, all in domestic currency units. These increases induce a .6%&#13;
increase in the CPI and the following effects:&#13;
(1) Increased competitiveness of exporters of industrial goods and&#13;
nonfactor services leading to an expansion of their exports&#13;
inducing a positive effect on growth.&#13;
(2)  Substitution away from imported agricultural, industrial goods&#13;
and nonfactor services and towards domestic production. This&#13;
also induces an expansion of GDP.&#13;
(3)  The expansion of the economy dominates the substitution effect&#13;
in energy and imports of energy increase. Given the inelastic&#13;
supply of agricultural goods, the expansion of the economy leads&#13;
to a lower agricultural surplus available for exports.&#13;
(4) The global effect on the current account deficit is very&#13;
favorable.&#13;
The increased competitiveness of the economy appears in the .6% increase in&#13;
the consumer price index while import and export price increase by 1%. The&#13;
increase in the consumer price index with the assumption of fixed nominal&#13;
factor prices means that real factor prices go down. The success of a&#13;
devaluation under this assumption is well kcnown. 1/ Let us assume now that&#13;
the .6% increase in CPI is completely passed on factor prices. Colulmns 2, 3&#13;
and 4 of Table 10 present the outcome of such increases and column 5 describes&#13;

how these increases attenuate the effect of the devaluation. However, this&#13;
leaves real factor prices still lower than before the devaluation. Indeed,&#13;
the CPI increases by .839% while the factor prices increase only by .6%.&#13;
Table 11, column 5, presents the case where both a devaluation of a 1% and an&#13;
increase in factor prices of 1% takes place, under the assumption that&#13;
government consumption is fixed in current prices. The CPI increases by 1%&#13;
leaving real factor prices constant. The post-devaluation GDP at constant&#13;
market prices is lower and the economy expesriences a higher level of&#13;
inflation. The only favorable result which is left is a moderate improvement&#13;
in the current account deficit.&#13;
Consider now the case where both an absorption and a switching&#13;
policy are applied. The combined effects are shown in column 7 of Table 11.&#13;
The economy is sustantially slowed down:   GDP at constant market prices drops&#13;
by .37%, aggregate demand drops pulling down imports and leaving a larger&#13;
agricultural exportable surplus; the current account improves dramatically;&#13;
inflation is higher than before the interventions. Again a crucial assumption&#13;
underlying the preceding results is the reLative real factor price&#13;
flexibility. If they are rigid downwards, devaluation even combined with a&#13;
reduction in absorption will not be successful. The success of the switching&#13;
and absorption policies will depend on the degree of downwards flexibility of&#13;
real factor prices. 1/&#13;
2. A Belt-tightening Policy&#13;
In the preceding discussion we have discussed how marginal changes&#13;
in fiscal policy instruments might affect the performance of the economy in&#13;
1/ A question left open here is the exteni: to which this downward rigidity is&#13;
borne by wages or profits.&#13;

terms of GDP, export performance, imports and the external balance. The&#13;
analysis of elasticities has shown how a combination of:&#13;
(1)  1% decrease in government consumption;&#13;
(2)  1% increase in tax rates (domestic and import) on energy;&#13;
(3)  1% increase in the personal tax rate on households;&#13;
(4)  1% increase in the corporate tax rate;&#13;
would reduce GDP, improve the external balance and increase government&#13;
revenues. We now ask how non-marginal changes in these policies, if applied&#13;
from 1982 onwards, would alter the path of the economy during the period of&#13;
the fifth five-year plan. We maintain the assumption of the absence of&#13;
changes in the environment and, hence, compare the resulting path with the&#13;
reference path. Specifically the implemented policies are the following:./&#13;
(1) Reduce the rate of growth of real government consumption from&#13;
7.8% to 6.1%;&#13;
(2)  Increase simultaneously the tax rate on domestically-produced&#13;
and imported energy in order to avoid changing their relative&#13;
prices; the domestic tax is increased from 1.4% to 3.6% and the&#13;
tariff on imports from 3.7% to 6.0%;&#13;
(3) Increase the rate of corporate taxes from 12.8% to 15%;&#13;
(4) Double the rate of the personal income tax from 1.8% to 3.6%.&#13;
The results obtained from this set of policies are described in Table 12. The&#13;
increased taxation and reduction in the rate of growth of public current con-&#13;
sumption has the expected effect of slowing down the economy. The GDP rate of&#13;
growth on average drops to 6.4%, and the rate of growth of private consumption&#13;
drops by almost 20% because of the doubling of the personal income tax. All&#13;
1/ The tax rates mentioned here are the rat:ios of the tax collection on the&#13;
tax base; herLce they are effective tax rates and not nominal ones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

this leads to the standard result of a lower import growth and of a larger&#13;
agricultural surplus available for exports. In terms of the external balance,&#13;
there is a substantial improvement of the resource gap which drops to 3% of&#13;
GDP by 1986, while the current account deficit reaches 5.2%. Of course, the&#13;
selected policies substantially improve the government finances and push up&#13;
government savings (on current account) to 3.5% of GDP in 1986. Despite the&#13;
belt-tightening nature of the policies simulated here, it would appear that&#13;
the current account deficit will remain a problem throughout the period of the&#13;
fifth five-year plan. This indicates that pure demand management policies in&#13;
a period of deep external imbalance have only a limited effect.&#13;
V. POLICY INTERVENTIONS IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT&#13;
In the previous section we have considered a policy aimed at cutting&#13;
absorption in the absence of any change in the environment. The discussions&#13;
demonstrated how, and to what extent, belt-tightening by itself can improve&#13;
the external balance. Previously we had reviewed how, and to what extent,&#13;
changes in the environment, in the absence of policy intervention, can relieve&#13;
the economy from the balance of payments constraint without hurting growth.&#13;
The improvement in the external balance was limited, though more pronounced&#13;
than, in the case of pure belt tightening.&#13;
We now assume that all the changes in the environment, postulated&#13;
previously, do take place, and that at the same time government will apply a&#13;
policy of expenditure restraint, resource mobilization from households and&#13;
corporations and increased taxation of energy. In fact, we are considering&#13;
now the effects of combining the changes in the environment and in policies&#13;
which were dealt with separately before. Table 13 presents the path generated&#13;
under these assumptions and allows its comparison with the previous results.&#13;

In terms of growth of the economy, one obtains a path between the one assuming&#13;
no policy intervention but changing the environment and the one assuming the&#13;
reverse. The changes in the environment push up growth, and the cut in&#13;
absorption policies brings it down. However, the effects of the changes in&#13;
the environment are larger since the rate of growth is even higher than that&#13;
obtained for the reference path. The external balance is dramatically&#13;
improved as the resource gap drops, by 1986, to .5% of GDP and the current&#13;
account deficit becomes less than 3% of GDP. A dramatic improvement of&#13;
government savings also occurs. By and large the combination of changes in&#13;
the environment and of policy intervention aimed at reducing absorption&#13;
produces the most attractive path. Although the changes in the environment&#13;
are rather uncertain and it is our impression that they are rather optimistic,&#13;
it is, nonetheless, clear from the experiments shown here, that changes in&#13;
environment do matter for both growth and the external balance. Their&#13;
influence appears to be more important while less damaging in terms of growth&#13;
than policies aimed at reducing absorption. Consequently, effort ought to be&#13;
devoted to the creation of conditions allowing, inasmuch as possible,&#13;
appropriate changes in the environment to take place. Particularly important&#13;
in this respect are efforts aiming at sustained agricultural growth and export&#13;
promotion.&#13;
VI. STRUCTURAL CHANGES&#13;
In the foregoing, the adjustment of the economy to the external&#13;
imbalance was supposed to take place through either a reduction in absorption&#13;
imposed by fiscal policy or changes in the environment. No change in the&#13;
conditions of agriculture production, in the use of energy or in the&#13;
productivity of primary factors of production were supposed to occur.&#13;
Furthermore, the conditions governing import behavior, such as the case of&#13;

substitution between imports and domestically-produced goods, of the long-run&#13;
propensities to import remained unchanged. In the following, we consider the&#13;
extent to which variations in the above conditions can contribute to the&#13;
process of adjustment of the economy. Table 14 presents elasticities of&#13;
selected aggregate indicators with respect to parameters describing (1) the&#13;
conditions of agriculture production (columns 1 to 3); (2) the intensity of&#13;
energy use (columns 4 to 6); (3) the productivity of primary factors of&#13;
production (columns 7 to 9); and (4) the conditions governing the behavior of&#13;
imports (columns 10 to 13).&#13;
1. Agricultural Transformation&#13;
Let us assume that agriculture becomes more energy efficient and the&#13;
input-output coefficient of deliveries from energy to agriculture drops by&#13;
1%. The price of domestically-produced agricultural goods is determined by&#13;
the world price of agricultural exports. A drop in the energy input-output&#13;
coefficient would then generate more proceeds to value added. Since&#13;
agricultural production is given, agricultural GDP would increase, thereby&#13;
contributing to an increase in total GDP and generating an expansion of the&#13;
economy; the energy sector, however, would not follow as it faces a slackened&#13;
demand. All imports would expand except energy imports which would drop. The&#13;
overall expansion of the economy would leave a smaller agricultural surplus,&#13;
while agricultural exports would drop. The effect on the current account&#13;
deficit would be favorable. If, however, in the face of the emerging land&#13;
constraint, extended needs of irrigation were to appear requiring heavier use&#13;
of water pumps, agricultural production could well become more energy&#13;
intensive. The symmetrical story to the one presented would become more&#13;
relevant and the effects on both GDP and the external balance would not be&#13;
favorable. A similar problem would arise if agricultural growth were&#13;

agricultural exports would drop. The effect on the current account deficit&#13;
would be favorable. If, however, in the face of the emerging land constraint,&#13;
extended needs of irrigation were to appear requiring heavier use of water&#13;
pumps, agricultural production could well become more energy intensive. The&#13;
symmetrical story to the one presented would become more relevant and the&#13;
effects on both GDP and the external balance would not be favorable. A&#13;
similar problem would arise if agricultural growth were maintained through a&#13;
heavier use of fertilizers. The input-output coefficient of deliveries from&#13;
industry to agriculture would increase (column 3), squeezing-out the value--&#13;
added share in agriculture and slowing down the economy, but it would also&#13;
induce a higher demand for industrial imports. The slowing-down of nonindus-&#13;
trial imports and the increase in agricultural exports would not suffice to&#13;
offset the increased industrial imports, and a widening of the current account&#13;
deficit would follow.&#13;
The likelihood of an agricultural sector using energy and fertili-&#13;
zers more intensively is not incompatible with a view of an agricultural sec-&#13;
tor more efficient in the overall use of intermediate inputs. For example,&#13;
one can imagine a higher efficiency in the use of intermediate products other&#13;
than energy and fertilizers, which would compensate for the more intensive use&#13;
of these two items. If such a development takes place, the share of value&#13;
added in agriculture may increase. Column 2 indicates the implications of a&#13;
1% increase in this share.1 There are basically two effects: First is the&#13;
expansion of agricultural value added; and the second is the reduction in in-&#13;

external balance, the parity of the baht with the dollar was changed.&#13;
Successive devaluations lead to an approximately 12%.depreciation vis-a-vis&#13;
the US dollar. These manipulations of the exchange rate calls for an&#13;
appraisal of the role of the devaluation in the adjustment to the external&#13;
imbalance. Such an analysis is undertaken here within the framework of the&#13;
SIAM1 model.  We first describe the treatment of trade in SIAM1 and then&#13;
analyze the effect of a devaluation.&#13;
The supply of imports is assumed to be perfectly elastic at the&#13;
given (exogenous) world prices. The demand for imports is derived using the&#13;
Armington approach. 1/ According to this approach imports and domestically-&#13;
produced goods are more or less substitutes and their shares in aggregate&#13;
demand depend on the their relative prices. Hence, an increase in import&#13;
prices in domestic currency induces a substitution of demand away from imports&#13;
and towards dornestic goods. In SIAMI, there are three types of exports:&#13;
agriculture, industrial goods and non-factor services. In agriculture, supply&#13;
is given, the world price determines the domestic price and exports are what&#13;
is left after domestic demand has been satisfied. They are valued at the&#13;
world price. For exports of industrial goods and nonfactor services, Thai&#13;
exporters are assumed to face world demands which depend on the ratio of the&#13;
world price to their own supply price. An increase in the world price,&#13;
measured in domestic currency units, relative to the supply price of exporters&#13;
means an increase in their competitiveness. Finally, as it was mentioned&#13;
before SIAM1 is a fix-price model where supply adjusts to demand in all&#13;
sectors except agriculture.&#13;

generated in agriculture is more than enough to increase total GDP. The drop&#13;
in the gross output of the nonagricultural sectors induces a reduction in&#13;
imports and given agricultural supply, also leaves a larger agricultural&#13;
surplus to be exported. The overall effect is an improvement in the current&#13;
account deficit. A point to notice is that some income redistribution has&#13;
taken place in the process, agricultural incomes having increased relative to&#13;
the nonagricultural ones. Basically then, below full capacity utilization in&#13;
the nonagricultural sectors and with the assumption that these sectors are&#13;
demand driven, an increase in the value added sharel/ in agriculture improves&#13;
GDP and the current account deficit while it redistributes income towards&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
2. Increased Efficiency in the Use of Energy&#13;
Consider now the implications of a more efficient use of energy in&#13;
the nonagricultural sectors. Columns 4 to 6 indicate the effects of a 1% drop&#13;
in the input-output coefficients describing the intermediate demand for energy&#13;
by these sectors; basically, this means a redistribution of the constant price&#13;
cost structure of the sectors. For each unit of gross output the share of&#13;
energy is lower and the shares of other inputs are higher. Consequently, for&#13;
any vector of gross outputs, on the one hand, higher demand will face the non-&#13;
energy sectors and primary factors of production and, on the other hand,&#13;
energy will be faced with a lower demand. This will tend to depress the&#13;
energy sector and expand the other sectors and value added. Because the&#13;
energy sector holds a relatively small share, GDP will expand. This expansion&#13;
of activity will be helped by the movement of prices. Indeed, under the&#13;
assumption that energy prices grow faster than other prices, the higher&#13;

intermediate inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 --&#13;
efficiency in energy use will mean lower domestic prices (for example, a drop&#13;
in the consumer price index). The economy thus becomes more competitive, and&#13;
exports of industrial goods and of services expand. The effects on trade&#13;
consist of, on the one hand, a slowing down of energy imports and of&#13;
agricultural exports due to the smaller available surplus and, on the other&#13;
hand, an expansion of non-energy imports (higher aggregate demand) and of&#13;
nonagricultura:L exports (higher competitivness). The global effect is an&#13;
improvement in the current account deficit.&#13;
3. More Efficient Use of Intermediate Inputs&#13;
With the oil price shocks and the presumption of higher energy costs&#13;
in the long run, the tendency is to focus on efficiency in energy use and to&#13;
pay less attention to increased efficiency in the use of intermediate inputs&#13;
in general. However, energy as such is a relatively small input and it has&#13;
been pointed out that the difficulties created, at least after the first oil&#13;
price shock, were also due to the general increases in the prices of other&#13;
intermediate raw materials.1/ Therefore, it seems appropriate to consider the&#13;
effects of higher efficiency in the use o.E all intermediate inputs. Results&#13;
of the effects of a 1% increase in the va:Lue-added share in industry, energy&#13;
and services are presented in columns 7, 8 and 9 of Table 14.    Indeed, an&#13;
increase in this share is equivalant to a drop in the share of all&#13;
intermediate inputs or, alternatively, to improved efficiency in their use:&#13;
In fact a change occurs in the cost strucl:ure between intermediate and primary&#13;
inputs. This change does not produce the same effects in all sectors.&#13;
Consider industry: A given level of output generates relatively&#13;
more value added and less demand for intermediate inputs. Value added feeds&#13;

Slowdown." Bruno's result on the negative effect of value added of a real&#13;
price increase of raw materials is reproduced here.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

into national income and increases final demand. The question is then what&#13;
happens to aggregate demand: does the increase in final demand dominate the&#13;
drop in intermediate demands or vice-versa? In the industrial sector, as it&#13;
is shown in column 7, the reduction in intermediate demands dominates, aggre-&#13;
gate demand drops and value added in energy and services follows. Aggregate&#13;
demand in industry falls too, as, despite the 1% increase in the share of&#13;
value added, the latter increases only by .95%. Although all aggregate&#13;
demands fall, the increase of value added in industry by .95% dominates and&#13;
GDP increases. The fall in aggregate demands pulls down indirect taxes and&#13;
the effect is larger than the proceeds from direct taxation due to increased&#13;
incomes; government revenue falls less than indirect taxes. The drop in&#13;
aggregate demands also induces a fall in imports but leaves a larger&#13;
agricultural surplus which contributes to higher agricultural exports. Apart&#13;
from the effect on aggregate demands there is also an effect on prices. Given&#13;
that prices of intermediates are higher than the price of value added,!/ gross&#13;
prices fall and this appears in the drop of the consumer price index. It also&#13;
increases the competitiveness of industry and services whose exports&#13;
increase. The reduction in imports and expansion of exports improves the&#13;
resource gap and contributes to the improvement of the current account&#13;
deficit. A by-product of the increased share of value added in industry is a&#13;
redistribution of income towards this sector.&#13;
Consider an increase in the share of value added in energy (column&#13;
8). A given level of production of energy produces now more incomes which&#13;
contribute to the expansion of final demand. It also depresses intermediate&#13;
demands. However, in this case, except for the energy sector, the increase in&#13;
1/ The elasticities presented in Table 14 are computed for 1985 relative to&#13;
the reference path where the assumption is a growth of net prices slower&#13;
than that of imports, especially energy imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
the final demand dominates the drop in intermediate demands. 1/ Consequently,&#13;
the value added in all sectors expands, while the drop in aggregate demand for&#13;
energy reduces the collection of indirect taxes, but not enough to produce a&#13;
fall in government revenues. Indeed, the collection of direct taxes increases&#13;
due to the expansion of incomes. The lower aggregate demand of energy&#13;
contributes to a drop in imports of energy (by .12%); but agricultural and&#13;
industrial imports expand because of the expansion in the aggregate demands&#13;
for these sectors. Though aggregate demand for services increases, imports of&#13;
services drop slightly, the reason being that a drop in domestic prices&#13;
induced a substitution towards domestic services which more than compensates&#13;
the increase in aggregate demand. The effects are, however, small. The&#13;
reduction in prices, as in the case of industry, increases the competitiveness&#13;
of the economy and contributes to the expansion of exports of industry and&#13;
services. Exports of agriculture, on the other hand, drop because of the&#13;
increase of aggregate demands, but the overall effect on the current account&#13;
deficit is positive.&#13;
The case of an increase in the share of yalue added in services is&#13;
in between industry and energy, although closer to industry. The only&#13;
difference with respect to the latter sector is that the increase in the final&#13;
demand of agricultural goods more than compensates for any drop in the&#13;
intermediate demands for the products of that sector. The implications are an&#13;
expansion of agricultural imports and a reduction of exports.    Otherwise, the&#13;
results are similar to those obtained for industry; in particular, there is an&#13;
increase in CDP, an improvement in the current account and a drop in prices.&#13;
1/ The main intermediate demand entering the production of energy is energy&#13;
itself (oil), the demand for other intermediate inputs is relatively&#13;
minor. Furthermore their weight in total demand for intermediates is also&#13;
very small.&#13;

4. Structural Change in the Behavior of Imports&#13;
The closing of the resource gap depends to a large extent on the&#13;
behavior of imports. Fiscal policy intervention, by slowing down absorption,&#13;
can help reduce the growth of imports and improve the resource gap. Change in&#13;
the degree of substitutability between imports and domestic goods as well as&#13;
structural reduction in the import shares also influence the resource gap.&#13;
Let us consider first the degree of substitutability: This reflects the ease&#13;
with which domestic aggregate demand can shift between imports and domestic&#13;
goods due to a change in relative prices. An increase in the degree of sub-&#13;
stitutability means, on the one hand, that the potential for shifts between&#13;
the two sources of supply is increased and, on the other hand, that domestic&#13;
demand is more sensitive to relative prices. Columns 10 and 12 indicate the&#13;
effects of a 1% increase in the elasticity of substitution between imports and&#13;
domestic goods for energy and industry respectively. In order to interpret&#13;
the results it is useful to remember that the elasticities are computed with&#13;
respect to the reference run and for the year 1985. An assumption underlying&#13;
this path is that import prices grow faster than value added prices. This&#13;
means that in 1985 domestic prices will be lower than import prices, in which&#13;
case an increase in the elasticity of substitution will lead to a shift of&#13;
demand from imports to domestic goods. This explains the drop of industrial&#13;
and energy imports by .1 6% and .004%, respectively. The increased demand for&#13;
domestic goods contributes to a general expansion of aggregate demand and of&#13;
GDP. This, in turn, increases imports of the goods where the elasticity&#13;
remains constant. The general expansion of the economy leads also to a&#13;
decrease in the exports of agricultural goods. While in the case of industry&#13;
the global effect on the current account deficit is positive, in the case of&#13;
energy it is negative. This is due to the relative weights of the different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
imports.1/ Two observations are relevant to the preceding results: First,&#13;
the change in the elasticity of substitution of energy has hardly any effect,&#13;
and second, had our assumption on prices been different, the outcome of the&#13;
change in elast:Lcities would have also been different especially for industry.&#13;
Consider now a structural reduction in the import shares of industry&#13;
and energy. This reduction can be the outcome of a process of import substi-&#13;
tution where domestic supply expands and domestic users shift their demand in&#13;
a nontransitory way towards the domestic goods. In the case of energy, the&#13;
coming on stream of gas production and the substitution of oil by gas wherever&#13;
it is feasible will lead to a drop in the import share of energy. Columns 11&#13;
and 13 present the effects of a 1% drop in the import shares of energy and&#13;
industrial goods, respectively. Although the amount of changes are different&#13;
in the two cases, the directions of changes are the same. Because world&#13;
import prices are higher than domestic prices, a drop in the share of imports&#13;
leads to a general decline in domestic prices: the CPI drops. The shift out&#13;
of imports of either industrial goods or energy contributes to the expansion&#13;
of incomes and aggregate demands. Imports of other goods increase and exports&#13;
of agricultural goods decline. The drop in domestic prices improves the&#13;
competitiveness of the economy, and exports of industry and services expand.&#13;
The total effect on the current account is positive.&#13;
VII.   CONCLUSION&#13;
The broad assumptions under which the preceding analysis is based&#13;
are (1) that in the beginning of the eighties and during the period of the&#13;
fifth five-year plan, the Thai economy will not be working at full capacity;&#13;
(2) that inflation in Thailand is essentially of the cost-push type; and (3)&#13;
1/ Industria:L imports would be close to 59% of total imports in 1985.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
aggregate demand and agricultural performance play a crucial role, both in&#13;
terms of growth and external equilibrium.&#13;
Under these assumptions, improved efficiency in the use of&#13;
intermediate inputs appears to be the only type of change which has favorable&#13;
effects on growth, the macroeconomic balance and inflation. Efforts aimed at&#13;
reducing the intensity of use of energy, and intermediates in general, deserve&#13;
high priority. Such efforts will be needed in the nonagricultural sectors in&#13;
view of the more intensive use of intermediates which is likely to take place&#13;
in agriculture due to the emergence of the land constraint. Indeed, a shift&#13;
from extensive to intensive agriculture entails a larger use of intermediates&#13;
in agricultural production.&#13;
Fiscal policy interventions aiming at reducing absorption are likely&#13;
to have favorable effects on the macroeconomic balance. They would, however,&#13;
generate adverse effects on growth and inflation under our working&#13;
assumptions. The final outcome of fiscal policy interventions depends as much&#13;
on these policies as on the development in the environment in which they take&#13;
place. Very careful assessment of the likely developments in the environment&#13;
of the economy are needed prior to any major decisions aiming at absorption&#13;
reduction. If a rather conservative view of developments, exogenous to the&#13;
economy is taken, it would be preferable that fiscal policy intervention aimed&#13;
at slowing down the economy be very moderate. In this case, also, attention&#13;
may be devoted to other types of intervention.&#13;
As is well known, a devaluation would have favorable effects on both&#13;
the macroeconomic balance and growth if real factor prices are flexible. It&#13;
would, however, contribute to increased inflation. If real factor prices are&#13;
not flexible downwards, but have a unit elasticity with respect to the&#13;
consumer price index, inflationary pressures would be higher, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
macroeconomic baLance would improve, but less markedly and real incomes would&#13;
not grow as much. Devaluation is then to be used very carefully and, if used,&#13;
factor prices ought to be closely monitored. They may fully adjust to the&#13;
first round increase in the consumer price index, but further increases would&#13;
damage both inflation and growth. The benefit for the external balance would&#13;
almost completely vanish.&#13;
If structural changes improving the efficiency in the use of&#13;
intermediates have favorable effects on growth, the macroeconomic balance and&#13;
inflation, fiscal policy interventions or (levaluation have mixed effects.&#13;
Favorable developments exogenous to the Thai economy could on their own help&#13;
improving dramatically the macroeconomic balance, without hurting growth.&#13;
Indeed a big expansion of exports of industrial goods and services&#13;
can contribute a lot to growth and to the macroeconomic balance. Although&#13;
this depends on the economic conditions in the world, the expansion of export&#13;
can be helped by higher price competitiveness, improved marketing, improved&#13;
quality and diversification. A reorientation of exports towards high growth&#13;
non-OECD countries may also contribute to the growth of exports. Although the&#13;
mere expansion of the quantity of exports is desirable, the restructuring of&#13;
trade needs to be seriously contemplated. Thailand has suffered from&#13;
deteriorations in the terms of trade. Because Thailand is a small open&#13;
economy, the terms of trade are, in a sense, imposed on her. The only way to&#13;
counter that is to change the weights of the different items traded. High&#13;
price exports could be promoted and import substitution away from high cost&#13;
imports could be encouraged.&#13;
Structural adjustment needs a heavy emphasis on efficiency&#13;
improvements. It requires a good perception of the likely developments in&#13;
terms of world prices and of the potential for exports. It is essentially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
based on these perceptions, that a restructuring of trade should take place.&#13;
Fiscal and exchange rate policies need to be considered in the context of this&#13;
overall restructuring of the economy. Their primary goal is to facilitate the&#13;
process. If misused they could hinder it and thus produce long-run damaging&#13;
effects.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
Implementation of the SIAM1 Model: A Short Description&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
The purpose of this appendix is to document the version of the SIAM1&#13;
model that was used to produce the results :in the main paper, to explain how&#13;
the model was solved, and to describe some of the reports it can generate.&#13;
The appendix will first describe the data base for the model. The&#13;
model itself, that consists of a price and value/quantity module, is explained&#13;
in the following two sections. The description of the two modules follow the&#13;
same format: first, we describe the variables of the module, then we explain&#13;
the equations, and finally we outline the solution strategy.&#13;
The final section of the appendix describes the computer implementa-&#13;
tion of the model and it shows, with examples, the reports that can be&#13;
generated by the model.&#13;
2. The Data Base for the SIAM1 Model&#13;
The SIAM1 model is based on the accounting framework of a Social&#13;
Accounting Matrix (SAM), see Pyatt [3]. The SAM from the base-year 1980, from&#13;
which many of the parameters in the model are derived, is shown in Fig. A.l.&#13;
The names of the accounts in the SAM are in most cases self-&#13;
explanatory: INST-CUR is an abbreviation for Institutions - Current Account;&#13;
H-HOLD is household; PROD-ACT is production activity; IND-TAX is indirect tax and&#13;
import/export duty; and R-WORLD is an aggregate account for the rest of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 --&#13;
world. The CAPITAL account is a combined account for all investments&#13;
(expenditures) and savings (incomes).&#13;
The 1980-SAM is mainly based on preliminary national accounts&#13;
data. Unfortunately, this data does not decompose the final demand on&#13;
supplying sectors, and the use of intermediates is not reported. These parts&#13;
of the SAM have therefore been derived by using a RAS-technique on the 1975-SAM&#13;
in Grais [1].&#13;
From the base-year SAM, we compute the matrix of technical coefficients,&#13;
aij , by dividing each column by the column total. a'. is shown in Fig. A.2.&#13;
ij&#13;
The technical coefficients describe the pattern of outlays for each account in&#13;
the base-year, and they are therefore a valuable source of information about the&#13;
structure of the economy. As we will see in the next two sections, they are used&#13;
in many parts of the model.&#13;
3. The Price Module&#13;
The price module of the SIAM1 model computes price indices for most&#13;
of the accounts in the SAM. By definition, all price indices are 1 in the&#13;
base-year, 1980. We will start by explaining what the prices in the accounts&#13;
really mean, then we give the price equations, and finally we describe the&#13;
closure of the model and the solution method.&#13;
The prices in the first 4 factor accounts (see Fig. A.1.) are the&#13;
net prices in the 4 production activities. The next 4 accounts, the total&#13;
factor and the institutions income accounts, have no prices in the model. The&#13;
prices in account 9 to 11 are the consumer price index, and price indices for&#13;
government consumption and for investment respectively. The prices for the pro-&#13;
duction activities are the producers prices; the prices for domestic commodities&#13;
are the market prices of domestically produced commodities; the prices for imported&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
commodities are landed prices of imports (i.e., including duty); and the prices&#13;
for exported commodities are export prices including export taxes. The prices&#13;
in the composite commodity accounts reflect the aggregate price of imported&#13;
and domestic commodities. Finally, the accounts for indirect taxes and for&#13;
the rest of the world have no prices.&#13;
The price equations for the production activities, household and govern-&#13;
ment consumption,and capital (investment) are all of the form:&#13;
p;  =  E a1..*Pi                                        (1)&#13;
j      il       -p&#13;
where pj and pi are the prices of account j and i, respectively, and&#13;
a0   are the technical coefficients from the base-year SAM.    The summation is&#13;
over all rows or expenditure accounts, i.&#13;
The market prices for domestic goods and export prices follow the&#13;
equation:&#13;
p   =   (1 + e (t)) - a"  * P                              (2)&#13;
where  6.(t)   is the exogenously given, rate of indirect tax or export tax for&#13;
the account.  The index   i  represent the production activity that delivers&#13;
the good.&#13;
The price equation for imported goods is similar to (2):&#13;
pj  =   (1 + 8.(t)) - aC. * PWI,                           (3)&#13;
where  PWI.   is the exogenously given world market import price for the relevant&#13;
sector, and e.(t) is the rate of import duty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
The final group of price equations define the prices of the composite&#13;
goods:&#13;
1 +   ()).&#13;
p   =                         j (1 + ej(t))    l       a           (4)&#13;
The equation is derived from cost minimization under a constraint given by&#13;
a CES function aggregating imports and domestic commodities into the composite.&#13;
aj are 0.8, 3.0, 0.15, and 3.0 for the four sectors. (Here, and in future&#13;
references to the four sectors, the order is: agriculture, industry, energy,&#13;
and services).&#13;
The total number of accounts with prices is 27: there are 33 accounts&#13;
but 6 does not have prices. The number of equations is 23: there are 7&#13;
equations in group (1), 8 in group (2), 4 in group (3), and 4 equations in&#13;
group (4). The price module is closed by making 4 prices exogenous: the net&#13;
prices in industry, energy, and services are made exogenous, and the export&#13;
price for agricultural commodities is assumed to be equal to the exogenously&#13;
given world market export price, PWE.&#13;
The price module is solved as follows: from (3), we compute the&#13;
prices of imported commodities. Given the agricultural export price, we solve&#13;
(2) for the agricultural producers price, and compute the price of domestic&#13;
and composite agricultural commodities from (2) and (4).&#13;
The producers prices and prices for domestic and composite commodities&#13;
in the remaining three sectors are computed by iterating between (1), (2), and&#13;
(4), that is within a simulataneous block of 9 variables and equations. As&#13;
initial guesses we use the prices from the previous period, except in the first&#13;
period, where we use 1. 10-15 iterations are usually enough to reach 5 digits&#13;
accuracy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
After solving the simultaneous block, we compute the export prices&#13;
in the non-agricultural sectors from (2), the agricultural net price by&#13;
rearranging (1), and the price indices for consumption and investment from&#13;
(1).&#13;
4. The Value Module&#13;
The second part of the SIAM1 model defines the content of the SAM&#13;
for the projection years.&#13;
The new variables in this part oE the model are: tii * the entry&#13;
in position (i, j) of the SAM; yi , the total income or expenditure of&#13;
account j in current prices; qj , the total income in account j in constant&#13;
prices; and   aij , the technical coefficient or expenditure share in position&#13;
(i, j) in the SAM.  tij   and  aij  are always based on current prices.&#13;
Following the approach of Grais and Pyatt [2], the main structure&#13;
of the model can be defined by classifying the aij's as shown in Fig. A.3.&#13;
Each nonzero cell in the tableis identified by a letter or number that refer&#13;
to the formulae and explanations in Fig. A.4. Notice that each class of a.Is&#13;
reflects some economic behavior.&#13;
Based on Fig. A.3 and A.4 we dei-ine the core of the model as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(1) The aij 's that are mentioned in Fig. A.3 must satisfy&#13;
the definitions in Fig. A.4.&#13;
(2) tij  and  aij  are linked by   t,j = aij . yj  for&#13;
all nonzero (i, J) positions.&#13;
(3) yi i      tij , all    i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
(4) Z aij = 1 all j&#13;
(5) q. = y./p.    for all accounts where   the prices  p.&#13;
are defined. The other accounts don't have a q-value.&#13;
The number of variables in the model is 250: 95 a's and t's,&#13;
33 y's and 27 q's. The number of equations is 270: 83 in group (1), 95 in&#13;
group (2), 33 in group (3) and group (4), and 27 in group (5). However, the&#13;
aij-formula are chosen such that (4) is satisfied in the 31 columns in which&#13;
the a's are defined. Furthermore, there is one linear dependence in the system&#13;
since the sum of all incomes automatically will be equal to the sum of all&#13;
expenditures. Therefore, the core model has 250 - (270 - 31 - 1) = 12 degrees&#13;
of freedom.&#13;
The SIAM1 model is therefore closed by fixing 12 variables: the total&#13;
investment quantity,   q11 , and the agricultural production quantity, q12 , are&#13;
exogenous. Transfer from the rest of the world to the total factor account,&#13;
t5,33 , to household, t6,33 , and    to government,   t8,33 * are also exogenous.&#13;
Exports in the energy sector is assumed to be zero, and exports in the industry&#13;
and service sectors are determined by&#13;
Ti.&#13;
ti,33 = ti,33 * rit * ( PWEi/p   )      i&#13;
where  ti      is the base year export,  r     is the nonprice-induced growth&#13;
I , 33                            i&#13;
factor,  PWEi  is the world market export price, and    ni  is a price&#13;
elasticity. n is 2.5 for industry and 2.0 for services. The last four&#13;
exogenous values are the use of government income for transfer to households,&#13;
t5 8   payments to companies, t68     government consumption,   10,8 X and&#13;
transfer to the rest of the world, t33,8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
The general solution strategy for this type of model is rather&#13;
simple:&#13;
1.  Guess an initial   yÂ° . Use for example the final values&#13;
from the previous year. In the first year, use zero. Set&#13;
the iteration counter k=O .&#13;
2.  Compute the exogenously defined    tIs&#13;
3.  Compute   a..  and set   t   = a      ky in all cells where an&#13;
aij is defined.&#13;
k+l&#13;
4.  Compute a new iterate    yX t1&#13;
j    J&#13;
5.  If  yk 1   is sufficiently close to   y   , go to 6, else&#13;
set k = k+l and go to 3.&#13;
6.  Compute      = yk+l /p   for all accounts with prices&#13;
defined.&#13;
This solution strategy follows the real economy closely. The income&#13;
yk  in one account is spent on other accounts,     ti  = ai     yk , and generates&#13;
income in these accounts,    yi   = I t,j . The iterations stop when the economy&#13;
is in balance, i.e., when incomes are equal to expenditures.&#13;
In the particular model we have defined by fixing certain variables,&#13;
we have to add a few steps to this general] solution procedure. We must take&#13;
care of the 3 cells (11,8), (11,33), and (28,33) were neither      tij  nor   aij&#13;
are defined, and the two accounts where     q;  and therefore   y.  is defined.&#13;
Between step 1 and 2 we add:&#13;
(a) Compute  y11 = q11 * P1l    anLd  y12  q12    P12&#13;
and between stiep 3 and 4 we add:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
(b) t118    Y    -      t ,8 : government saving is equal&#13;
to government income minus current expenditure.&#13;
(c) t11,33 =Yll     I   tll,   : current account deficit is&#13;
j #33&#13;
equal to total investment minus national savings.&#13;
(d) t12,28 = Y12 - t12,26 : agricultural export before tax&#13;
is equal to the exogenous production minus domestic demand.&#13;
(e) t32,28   a32,28/a12,28 *t12,28 : agricultural export tax&#13;
is computed.&#13;
(f) t28,33 = t12 28 + t32,28 : total agricultural export including&#13;
tax is summed up.&#13;
After the last step, we add:&#13;
(g) aij = tij/y1  for cells, where   ai   is not defined&#13;
otherwise.&#13;
The general solution strategy with the steps above added converge to&#13;
5 significant digits in 35-45 iterations. The large number of iterations is&#13;
mainly due to the long chain from institutions income via composite commodities,&#13;
domestic commodities, production activities, factor income and combined factor&#13;
income back to the institutions income accounts.&#13;
5. Computer Implementation of SIAM1&#13;
The SIAM1 model has been implemented in a set of FORTRAN subroutines.&#13;
The implementation has been guided by the following criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
(1) The computer program should be able to run both in&#13;
Washington and on the computer used by NESDB (National&#13;
Economic and Social Development Board) in Bangkok.&#13;
Everything has therefore been implemented in standard&#13;
FORTRAN without relying on existing, but nontransportable,&#13;
routines ordinarily used in the World Bank.&#13;
(2) The relationships with the underlying SAM have been&#13;
used in the implementation. As many subcomponents as&#13;
possible have been coded as SAM-procedures, that are&#13;
independent of the particular model.&#13;
(3) We expect that subcomponents will be modelled in more detail.&#13;
in the future and have therefore put emphasis on making&#13;
the computer code easy to update. The relationship with&#13;
SAMs mentioned in (2) has made this step easier.&#13;
The input to the model is divided into two parts, structural parameters&#13;
and exogenous time series. As mentioned :Ln section 2, most of the structural&#13;
parameters are derived from the base year SAM. This part has been coded&#13;
using standard SAM-routines. Other structural parameters such as elasticities&#13;
of substitution in the import and export functions are entered separately.&#13;
The main exogenous variables are: tax rates on imports, exports,&#13;
and on domestic and composite commodities in each of the four sectors; net&#13;
prices in the non-agricultural sectors; world market price indices for imports&#13;
and exports in each sector; and time paths for agricultural production,&#13;
investment, government expenditures, and transfers from the rest of the world.&#13;
The computer program has a specially designed input-procedure for these data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
It reproduces the input for verification and documentation purposes. Fig. A.5&#13;
shows as an example the documentation of the input to the reference run.&#13;
The solution part of the computer program is coded in two subroutines,&#13;
a price subroutine and a value subroutine. They follow the descriptions in&#13;
section 3 and 4 closely, so further explanations should not be necessary.&#13;
Some of the possible solution reports from the SIAM1 model have&#13;
already been mentioned. The computed SAMs or the computed matrices of technical&#13;
coefficients can all be printed in the format shown in Fig. A.1 and A.2. A SAM&#13;
in constant prices can also be produced as shown in Fig. A.6. The theory&#13;
behind the constant price SAM can be found in [2].&#13;
The tables mentioned in last paragraph are voluminous, and they are&#13;
often too detailed. More aggregated reports are therefore also available.&#13;
Fig. A.7 shows an example of the national accounts, both in current and constant&#13;
prices. This report extracts and aggregates information from various parts of&#13;
of the SAM. Further aggregation is found in the reports in Fig. A.8, that&#13;
list prices for all years and all accounts, and in Fig. A.9 and A.10 that list&#13;
the marginal values for all accounts in both current and constant prices.&#13;
The last procedure in the computer program is a procedure for&#13;
generating elasticities. The elasticities are computed by perturbing the&#13;
relevant parameter or exogenous variable by one percent, solving the model&#13;
again, and computing relative changes. The elasticities, which are computed&#13;
with respect to more than 60.parameters and exogenous variables, are printed&#13;
in tables as shown in Fig. A.ll. The results in tables 9, 10, 11, and 14 in&#13;
the main paper are based on these elasticities.&#13;

            Thailand - An analysis of structural and
            non-structural adjustments
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Within the framework of a four-sector
            macroeconomic model, comparative statics are used to assess
            alternative ways of macroeconomic adjustments in the Thai
            economy. Fiscal policy interventions, manipulations of the
            exchange rate and productivity improvements are discussed.
            Their implications in terms of income generation, external
            deficit and inflation are derived. It is shown that only
            productivity improvements have positive effects on all
            indicators. Fiscal interventions lead to an improvement in
            the external deficit, but at the cost of income generation.
            The outcome of a devaluation is largely dependent on the
