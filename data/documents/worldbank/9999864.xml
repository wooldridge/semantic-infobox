Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In recent years, there has been a growing recognition that the success of water, sanitation, and&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure projects depends to a large extent upon using Communication for Development (CfD) as a&#13;
facilitating tool in bringing about change processes. CfD refers to the social process of dialog, negotiation,&#13;
&#13;
and consensus building through the use of a variety of methods and mass and interpersonal means of&#13;
communication, as well as others, traditional and alternative. CfD seeks to foster social, political, and&#13;
&#13;
institutional changes at different levels by building trust between governments and citizens, promoting a&#13;
two-way communication, exchanging knowledge and skills and achieving political incidence with a view to&#13;
&#13;
seeking development initiatives that may be sustainable and consistent with reality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The experience of the last decade has proved that the best technically designed infrastructure projects can&#13;
fail or have weak results if decision makers and the civil society are not duly consulted, informed and&#13;
&#13;
mobilized. Within the context of the reform and decentralization processes undertaken by many Latin&#13;
American countries and the challenge of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the role of CfD has&#13;
&#13;
become vital as a generator of consensus and alliances among all the actors involved in the provision of&#13;
water and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Following on from this, and in agreement with the role of the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP),&#13;
&#13;
administered by the World Bank, to promote knowledge management in the sector, and also offer technical&#13;
assistance in social and communication issues, WSP for Latin America and the Caribbean (WSP-LAC)&#13;
&#13;
addresses this report to sector authorities, project managers, and professionals working in the sector. The&#13;
objective is to share main findings of a study on CfD in the water and sanitation sector in the region. Based&#13;
&#13;
on the systematization of experiences, the report seeks to document the added value of CfD in the&#13;
implementation of water and sanitation projects. Through case studies, evidence is given of the important&#13;
&#13;
role CfD plays in initiatives aimed at changing behavior, implementing sector reforms, encouraging the&#13;
participation of civil society, improving aspects of governance, and implementing infrastructure and water&#13;
&#13;
and sanitation systems.&#13;

&#13;
           At the beginning of the XXI century, nearly 2.6 billion    The interest in the role played by CfD in the water and&#13;
           people in the world (2 out of every 5) lack adequate       sanitation sector is increasingly entwined with the&#13;

           sanitation and 1 billion do not have access to drinking    processes of reform, above all with regard to&#13;
&#13;
           water, conditions particularly prevalent in developing     stimulating public debate and consultations with the&#13;
&#13;
           countries. International cooperation agencies and          different groups of actors, as well as strengthening&#13;
&#13;
           dozens of governments have termed this issue a             community participation processes in order to achieve&#13;
&#13;
           priority due to the negative impact it has on a            behavior changes aimed at improving the quality of life&#13;
&#13;

                                                                      processes in the sector, it is still necessary to explore&#13;
&#13;
           Besides overcoming the challenges in terms of              the strategic role played by communication in&#13;
&#13;
           infrastructure and the investments required for            improving governance through the promotion and&#13;
&#13;
           improving water and sanitation coverage and services,      facilitation of dialog between governments and citizens&#13;
&#13;
           this reality makes it necessary to explore participation   and the building of relations based on transparency,&#13;
&#13;
           mechanisms that may facilitate the involvement of the      trust, and credibility.&#13;

           this regard, the adequate implementation of                This report summarizes the results of a study on the&#13;

In order for the experiences of water and sanitation&#13;
from the perspective of CfD to be understood the&#13;
background and the conceptual framework of CfD must&#13;
be taken into account, especially regarding the context&#13;
of development. The concept of development has&#13;
changed gradually in the last fifty years from a view&#13;
associated with "modernization" processes9 to a hybrid&#13;
perspective which allows for the inclusion of                      social participation and mobilization in order to&#13;

to facilitate processes where "dialog within the          Graph 1: Construction of collective action for&#13;

to bring about social change to improve the well-being&#13;
of the entire community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A central element in participatory models is social&#13;
mobilization, which coalesces the efforts of different&#13;
inter-sectorial allies in order to achieve social&#13;
recognition and, concurrently, to promote demands for&#13;
development through participatory communication&#13;
processes. The greater the interest of the participants,&#13;
the more sustainable the social mobilization project&#13;
will be. Consequently, the processes of participatory&#13;
communication for development and social change&#13;
must contain a clear component of social mobilization.&#13;

             3. Outcomes of the analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             3.1. A unifying paradigm                                       paradigms instead of continuing with the divisions as&#13;
                                                                            had been done previously. They put forward arguments&#13;
             In the last decade, researchers into communication for         supporting the theoretical and practical convergence&#13;
             development have stated the need to unify these                of the paradigm as summarized below15:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The need for political will. The promoters and implementers of communication for development initiatives must&#13;
    understand that their results depend not only upon internal factors that affect communication but also upon the political will&#13;
    of the rulers and the degree of citizen empowerment.&#13;
    The need for a cross-cutting approach and to incorporate communication at the start of the initiatives.&#13;
    Communication for development must be regarded as a vital tool throughout the entire cycle of the project. Even before&#13;
    embarking on the design of an intervention, there needs to be an analysis that investigates the political risks, key actors,&#13;
    means of communication and where this takes place, as well as local capacities for implementing strategies and&#13;
    communication plans, identifying existing social networks and the participation of civil society. Posing questions about&#13;
    communication during the early stages of design may serve the purpose of anticipating future difficulties and facilitate the&#13;
    participation of the actors in the analysis of the situation and in the definition of objectives16.&#13;
    The need for multiple approaches and theories. It is more difficult to face the multiple development situations which&#13;
    require communication processes with only one approach. Therefore, it is necessary to combine theories and instruments&#13;
    which proved to be useful in the past.&#13;
    The need to integrate top-down and bottom-up approaches. Neither behavioral change nor social participation have&#13;
    proved to be self-sufficient regarding the planning of communication for development. Experience has shown that neither&#13;
    academic and elitist planning nor full and constant participation succeed on their own, but rather complement each other.&#13;
    The need to integrate forms and means of multimedia and interpersonal communication. Neither mass nor popular&#13;
    nor interpersonal communication can be neglected. Their use must be integrated and synergic.&#13;
    The need to integrate the approaches of individual and social change. The processes aimed at change on an individual&#13;
    level must be reinforced with efforts toward achieving collective action in order to achieve long term results. The social&#13;
    change approach is a good example of this type of integration.&#13;
    The need to understand communications as an interdisciplinary contribution. Communications should not be regarded&#13;
    as an end, but rather as means that facilitate the process of dialog, negotiation, and consensus in which multiple actors at&#13;
    different levels and from different disciplinary backgrounds are involved in the initiatives for development.&#13;
    The need to establish indicators to measure the progress and impact of the communicational component on the&#13;
    initiatives. To this end, it is crucial that formative research and a base line be secured prior to the design of any project and&#13;
    that they may identify and provide a diagnosis of the initial situation.&#13;

Social changes often require political, community, or&#13;
individual changes, the achievement of which will depend&#13;
to a large extent upon the activation of communication&#13;
processes that operate at the necessary levels according&#13;

and consensus building.&#13;

3.2.1. Types of intervention and communication&#13;
                                                          projects partake of aspects of dissemination and&#13;
       strategies&#13;
                                                          participation.&#13;
Within the diversity of strategies related to&#13;
communication and to the water and sanitation sector,     From the case studies the following findings were&#13;
the strategies of social mobilization and interpersonal   identified:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                              Communication, water and sanitation in Latin America&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The use of multiple participatory methods to achieve community mobilization such as self-diagnosis, PRA&#13;
(participatory rural appraisal) methods or of rapid diagnosis, planning and decision-making models, and environmental&#13;
protection actions. The Cotacachi case, in Ecuador, illustrates different participatory experiences in community processes&#13;
for water management, based on participatory approaches and the building of alliances to make decisions.&#13;
&#13;
The use of multiple training methods aimed at capacity building such as workshops, the use of audiovisual&#13;
pedagogical systems, training of trainers/facilitators, demonstrative methods, the inclusion of education centers and the&#13;
training of public officials. For instance, the work carried out by FAO in Latin America has emphasized the use of&#13;
audiovisual pedagogy to train peasants and transmit information from the government to the community, from the&#13;
community to the government, and from one community to another, thereby moving toward a perspective of social&#13;
networks or a communications circuit.&#13;
&#13;
The use of multiple forms of interpersonal communication such as community theater, edutainment18 in group work,&#13;
demonstrative sessions, and more traditional forms, such as orientation talks. A case in point is the conservation of the&#13;
Maya reserve in Guatemala, a process in which community theater was used, together with a radio program, in a water&#13;
management (acquisition and distribution) project at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
Work at the advocacy level for political incidence through the establishment of alliances, the involvement of&#13;
stakeholders, the development of public incidence strategies, work with opinion leaders, the lobbying of authorities, and&#13;
the search for consensus and the resolution of conflicts. In Guanajuato, Mexico, the report Towards a new water&#13;
management practice: Experiences and proposals of Guanajuato State for a participatory and decentralized&#13;
structure in services management describes how the process of decentralization made it possible to apply an&#13;
integrated approach, build alliances, and work with different sectors in water management, from infrastructure to the&#13;
promotion of a new water culture among the population.&#13;
&#13;
The use of strategies of social marketing through campaigns, merchandizing, branding, and actions involving mass&#13;
media (radio, TV, press, and public campaigns), some of which are based on elements related to the behavioral change&#13;
approach. By way of example, the campaign conducted by Population Services International and Procter &amp; Gamble in the&#13;
Dominican Republic provides PUR sachets (water purifiers) to make drinking water available for human consumption by&#13;
employing communication strategies with the support of the mass media (spots on TV / radio, banners, and products with&#13;
logos), the participation of volunteers from the Peace Corps and private distribution networks.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the convergence of approaches is illustrated by the pilot project on changing management models of water and&#13;
sanitation services in small towns in Peru (the Small Town Pilot Project-STPP) which incorporates elements from&#13;
communication for social change and empowerment, using multiple strategies of mass, popular, and interpersonal&#13;
communication derived from quick communication diagnosis based on participatory mechanisms such as the local&#13;
communication and social mobilization committees and the establishment of alliances with local and national&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                              implementing a media message to both entertain and educate, in order to&#13;

                                                              create favorable attitudes, and change behavior in line with certain&#13;
                                                              expectations (Extracted from Waisbord, 2003).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
              3.2.2. Experiences based on the achievement of                 The results show that the different indicators of the&#13;
                     results and goals                                       project experienced growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Many of the documents reviewed focus only on                   The case of Estrella Azul shows that interventions&#13;
              processes and methods but fail to mention both the             in infrastructure and communication complement&#13;
              individual and collective aspects of the change. In            each other. The Environmental Health Project&#13;
              contrast, other interventions emphasize that the               (EHP), responsible for the macro project, used&#13;
              progress of the project needs permanent monitoring             multiple methods to improve the health of the&#13;

              objectives, apart from the processes involved.                 quantitative and qualitative indicators, the EHP&#13;

                 Most projects based on participatory (bottom-up)            terms of infrastructure (e.g., the installation of&#13;
                 methods focus on the processes. However, within             latrines)&#13;
                 these cases, some strove to attain specific and&#13;
                 measurable results. For example, to strengthen              Regarding communications, a JHU/CCP&#13;

process together with multiple interventions and&#13;
communication strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Regarding interventions at the level of individual&#13;
change, qualitative and quantitative methods are&#13;
often employed, with measurements performed&#13;
before, during, and after the interventions. Estrella&#13;
Azul in Nicaragua made use of several M&amp;E&#13;
mechanisms. One of the interesting aspects in this&#13;
case was the discrepancy observed between what&#13;
had been reported in the surveys and what was&#13;
actually done, which led to the reinforcement of&#13;
actions to ensure that the reported practices were&#13;
maintained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At the community level, an interesting example is&#13;
the case of Proderith and "Communications in&#13;
Integrated River Basin Management" in Mexico.&#13;
Apart from qualitative results, such as the&#13;
improvement in the quality of the relations between&#13;
the community and the exogenous environmental&#13;
projects, the intervention was measured employing&#13;
indicators based on the number of meetings during&#13;
the project, the number of participants, the&#13;
proportion in terms of gender, the number of&#13;
participatory projects executed, and the production&#13;
of a radio program, as a means of evaluating the&#13;
process, also known as implementation evaluation,&#13;
in which there is a follow-up of activities in relation&#13;
to the proposed objectives, which provides&#13;
important information on the activities actually&#13;
carried out and on events which could affect the&#13;
results, beyond those to which communication&#13;
presumably contributed, such as the reduction in&#13;
the number of diseases and the transference of&#13;
control from the irrigation districts to the local&#13;
communities. The involvement of the community&#13;
and the fact that they regarded themselves as&#13;
protagonists of their own change emerged as key&#13;
factors in achieving greater sustainability of the&#13;
investments.&#13;

&#13;
              The processes of sector reform in Latin America reveal&#13;
              social problems caused by the transition from                4.3 Communication to promote civil&#13;

              and responsibility on the part of the citizenry with regard  to participate in the decision-making processes and&#13;
              to the sustainable use of the water resource.                types of management and use of the water resource.&#13;
                                                                           This is one of the areas that has generated the greatest&#13;
              However, project managers and technicians pay little         number of strategies and interventions associated with&#13;
              attention to the role of CfD and there are few explicit      communication in the region, especially in rural and&#13;
              references to it, even though in fact many processes         native environments and in poor peri-urban areas.&#13;
              include CfD. The indirect reference to civil protest, the&#13;
              mass media campaigns marshaled to promote the                Cases such as Rural Development and Environment:&#13;

Toward a new water management practice: Experiences and proposals from the State of Guanajuato for a participatory&#13;
and decentralized service management structure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The application of decentralization processes unleashes many complex social issues which must be tackled immediately.&#13;
Regarding the case of Guanajuato, the government availed itself of the opportunity to generate actions aimed at empowering&#13;
local communities, developing a method of water management in state organizations, and working toward the creation of a&#13;
new water culture among all the actors involved, especially through the promotion of the efficient use of water. In the&#13;
Guanajuato experience there is a convergence of communication methods and strategies, inasmuch as it carried out actions&#13;
through the mass media (TV, radio, and Internet), talks and meetings with representatives of different sectors and stakeholders,&#13;
and created technical councils on water with the participation of the citizens in order to contribute to the solution of water-&#13;
related problems in their own regions. Likewise, the water culture campaign was designed to implement a school-level&#13;
program using edutainment materials such as the Hydrokids Web Page, comics, interactive CDs, and so forth, as well as an&#13;
accreditation program for promoters. The federal program "Agua Limpia" ("Clean Water"), sought to emphasize the importance&#13;
of disinfecting water at a domestic level, as well as installing calcium hypochlorite equipment and water sterilizing plants and&#13;
delivering house-to-house 30 thousand bottles with colloidal silver droppers. This is an interesting instance of the convergence&#13;
of the participatory and social mobilization approaches, in a context of sector reform.&#13;

campaigns promoted a change of attitude and behavior&#13;
and strengthened the establishment of alliances and&#13;
synergies. Also, management that is oriented toward&#13;
planned goals and results may either stunt or&#13;
accelerate processes. Therefore, it is necessary to have&#13;
a communications team at project management level,&#13;
which would monitor progress in communicational&#13;
terms. In this manner, it was recognized that mass&#13;

opinion leaders and that a more systematic exposure to&#13;
media, linked directly to opinion leaders, is necessary.&#13;

            This report summarizes the results of a
            study on the role played by Communication for Development
            (CfD) in water and sanitation projects and programs in Latin
            America based on a review of 39 case studies and on
            documented experiences in this field. The specific
            objectives were as follows: 1) distil the lessons learned
            and identify factors of success, limiting factors and
            weaknesses, and 2) provide data and evidence of the added
            value and relevance of communication for development in the
            water and sanitation sector.
