            Lessons from power sector reform in England
            and Wales
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The 1990 power reforms in England and
            Wales were designed to permit the introduction of
            competition at both the retail and the wholesale level.
            Generation was both vertically separated from transmission
            and horizontally separated. The sector was almost completely
            privatized-only the nuclear capacity was left in public
            hands-and regulation was applied both to promote competition
            and to ensure that the remaining monopolies did not exploit
            their advantage. The new industry structure emerged with
            three generating companies: National Power (52 percent of
            capacity at that time) and PowerGen (33 percent), which were
            privatized, with 60 percent of their shares sold initially,
            and Nuclear Electric (15 percent), which was left under
            public ownership. National Power's share of capacity
            gave it significant market power. The national grid
            company-after separation from the generating companies-was
            transferred to joint ownership by the twelve privatized
            regional distribution companies. (The grid company retains
            control of dispatch.) Each of the twelve regional
            distribution companies (RECs) has two separate
            functions-distribution (through low voltage wires or, more
            simply, grid to door) and retail supply (the sale of
            electricity to final customers) -and these functions must be
            accounted for separately. Access to the distribution
            operation of the RECs is regulated so that any seller of
            electricity has the right to "use" the associated
            distribution network when selling to a final customer. Until
            March 1995, the government retained a "golden
            share" in each REC, giving it the power to block any
            takeover or merger.
