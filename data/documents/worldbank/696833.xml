URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
I.  BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    Legal and Institutional Framework for Environmental Management in Urban&#13;
Areas&#13;
1.    Environmental Management&#13;
1.    Colombia has a long tradition of environmental management and was one of the first&#13;
countries in Latin America to adopt comprehensive environmental legislation. The C6digo de&#13;
Recursos Naturales Renovablesy de Protecci6n al Medio Ambiente, adopted in 1973,&#13;
established the country's basic environmental legal framework. The responsibility for&#13;
implementing and enforcing the code was given to the Instituto Nacional de los Recursos&#13;
Naturales Renovables y del Ambiente (INDERENA), which focused its environmental&#13;
management on natural resources to the exclusion of urban environmental issues. A number&#13;
of other national and regional agencies, however, carried out related activities, often resulting&#13;
in unclear lines of authority and overlaps and gaps in responsibility. The regulatory&#13;
framework for natural resource management and pollution control was similarly fragmented&#13;
and had a poor enforcement record, either due to unrealistic standards, deficient monitoring&#13;
or inappropriate institutional mechanisms.&#13;
2.    The decade of the 1990s has seen a resurgence of interest in the environment in&#13;
Colombia. The new constitution, adopted in 1991, explicitly recognizes the right of the&#13;
citizens of Colombia to a healthy environment (Article 79) and identifies protection of the&#13;
environment among the fundamental objectives of the State for maintaining the general&#13;
welfare and improving the quality of life of the people (Article 366). Furthermore, in 1993,&#13;
Colombia passed new environmental framework legislation, Law 99, establishing a&#13;
comprehensive Sistema Nacional Ambiental (SINA) and creating the new Ministerio del&#13;
Medio Ambiente (MinAmbiente) to head the SINA. As the focal point for environmental&#13;
issues at the national level, MinAmbiente replaces INDERENA and exercises broad policy,&#13;
planning, and regulatory authorities for management of natural resources, prevention and&#13;
control of pollution, assessment of environmental impacts, and issuance of environmental&#13;
licenses. In carrying out its mandate, MinAmbiente is called upon by Law 99 to work in&#13;
close coordination with the National Planning Department (DNP), and with the Ministries of&#13;
Economic Development, Health, and Education, as well as with other government agencies&#13;
as needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.    The newly-established SINA defines the overall framework for environmental&#13;
management at the national, regional, and local levels of government in the country (see&#13;
Figure 1). The decentralization of environmental management envisioned under this system&#13;
will place increased responsibility for policy implementation and enforcement on the regional&#13;
and local levels of government. At the regional level, the country's 34 Corporaciones&#13;
Aut6nomas Regionales (CARs) will have to carry out most of the new environmental&#13;
management functions specified in Title VI of Law 99 (e.g., implementing national policies,&#13;
plans, and programs; issuing environmental licenses; setting regional environmental standards;&#13;
monitoring and enforcing environmental requirements; and collecting environmental fees and&#13;
taxes) under general guidance from MinAmbiente. At the departmental and municipal levels&#13;
of government, a set of local environmental management functions complementary to those&#13;
of the CARs are to be exercised. However, Law 99 gives special status to the major urban&#13;
centers with populations of over one million inhabitants (i.e., Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and&#13;
Barranquilla), which, assigned the same functions as the CARs, are to establish environmental&#13;
institutions and undertake the environmental management functions within their jurisdictions.&#13;
4.    As Figure 1 indicates, the SINA includes a number of other institutions with&#13;
intersectoral coordination, scientific and technical, and oversight and enforcement functions.&#13;
The Consejo Nacional Ambiental, which brings together governmental agencies (including&#13;
the National Planning Department - DNP), scientific institutions, non-governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs), environmental experts and representatives of specific social groups,&#13;
provides intersectoral coordination and advice on environmental policies, plans, and sectoral&#13;
agendas. The Consejo Thcnico Asesor de Politica Ambiental, which is composed of&#13;
academics and representatives of the industrial, agricultural, mining, and petroleum sectors,&#13;
advises MinAmbiente on the environmental feasibility of major national projects, both public&#13;
and private, on the formulation of national policies, and on the promulgation of&#13;
environmental standards. To provide scientific and technical support, the SINA also&#13;
includes five institutes, one of which, the Instituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Estudios&#13;
Ambientales (IDEAM), is the core agency of the National Environmental Information System&#13;
(NEIS), as set forth in Decreto 1600 of 1994. Finally, several institutions carry out important&#13;
oversight and enforcement functions: the Contraloria General, which monitors public&#13;
expenditures on the environment by institutions of the SINA; the Procuraduria Delegada&#13;
para Asuntos Ambientales, which ensures effective implementation of environmental&#13;
provisions by the institutions of the SINA; and the Policia Ambiental, a special corps of the&#13;
National Police which will assist SINA institutions in enforcing the requirements of the law.&#13;
5.    MinAmbiente is in the process of preparing the regulations, standards, and procedures&#13;
necessary to institutionalize the SINA and to fully implement and enforce the provisions of&#13;
Law 99. For example, MinAmbiente has already promulgated the requirements and&#13;
procedures for obtaining environmental licenses (Decreto 1753 of 1994). At this point, much&#13;
of the national regulatory framework is in place, including regulations relating to: (i) air&#13;
pollution from fixed and mobile sources; (ii) water quality, use and pollution; (iii)&#13;
management of solid and hazardous waste (including imports); (iv) noise control;&#13;

(v) pesticides and toxic substances; (vi) environmental impact assessment; and (vii)&#13;
community participation. Based on these national regulations, the CARs and the urban&#13;
environmental agencies will have to adopt appropriate regional and local regulations,&#13;
technical standards, and procedures to fully implement their environmental mandate.&#13;
6.    Law 99 establishes a number of specific economic instruments to finance the new&#13;
environmental institutions and activities of the SINA. As specified in Title VII of the Law,&#13;
these include (i) charges for the use of the environment (i.e., air, water, and soil) as a sink for&#13;
the discharge of pollution (tasas retributivas) and to compensate for the use of renewable&#13;
natural resources (tasas compensatorias); (ii) charges for the use of water by public and&#13;
private entities to pay for the protection and restoration of water resources; (iii) a choice&#13;
between a percentage set-aside (i.e., 15 to 25.9 percent) of the revenues raised by local&#13;
governments in property taxes (impuesto predial), or a surcharge on the property taxes (i.e.&#13;
1.5/1000 to 2.5/1000) based on property appraisal; (iv) the transfer from large-scale&#13;
hydroelectric powers producers of a percentage (6 percent) of the gross receipts from their&#13;
sales of electricity; and (v) a percentage of annual revenues from the Fondo Nacional de&#13;
Regalias1. DNP has estimated that, through environmental charges and fees, approximately&#13;
US$ 264 million will be made available to the country's four major urban areas during the&#13;
1995-98 period. Detailed regulation for use of such instruments is, however, still pending.&#13;
In addition, Title XIII of Law 99 created two special environmental funds: the Fondo&#13;
Nacional Ambiental (FONAM) and the Fondo Ambiental de la Amazonia. The FONAM is a&#13;
special account established within MinAmbiente to support national, regional and local&#13;
implementation of environmental management policies, programs and activities, management&#13;
of natural resources (including national parks), institutional strengthening, and environmental&#13;
education. The FONAM's resources are derived from government appropriations, donations,&#13;
loans, and other specified sources. The Amazonian environmental fund is also a special&#13;
account established within MinAmbiente. It is designed to channel international technical and&#13;
financial assistance for the execution of environmental policies and projects in the Colombian&#13;
Amazon.&#13;
7.    Public participation in environmental management is guaranteed in Colombia through&#13;
a number of sectoral laws, as well as in Law 99 and the Constitution of 1991. Among other&#13;
things, Title X of Law 99 provides the public (i) the right to participate in the administrative&#13;
processes for issuing, modifying, or revoking environmental licenses and for imposing&#13;
sanctions for violations of environmental standards and (ii) the right, under certain conditions,&#13;
to a public hearing before the appropriate administrative authority concerning the issuance of&#13;
an environmental license. The latter was used, for example, to hold a public hearing on the&#13;
proposed runway for the El Dorado Airport in Bogota. Under related legal provisions, the&#13;
public may seek information on activities likely to cause pollution or threaten human health.&#13;
' The Fondo Nacional de Regalias is based on royalties paid by the petroleum, natural gas, and mining&#13;
industries for the extraction of non-renewable natural resources which are defined as national property. Total&#13;
annual revenues of the fund are estimated at between US$ 140-150 million. Of these, 20% are set aside for&#13;
natural resource management and environmental protection activities.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8.    Because the right to a healthy environment is guaranteed in the Constitution of 1991,&#13;
the general provisions contained in the Constitution to protect fundamental rights also apply&#13;
to protection of the environment. For example, under Article 86 of the Constitution, citizens&#13;
have the right, as a last resort, to initiate a legal action (acci6n de tutela) before a judge for&#13;
the protection of their constitutional rights when such rights are threatened by the action or&#13;
omission of any public authority. The acci6n de tutela was first used in 1992 in the city of&#13;
Buga to address health and environmental threats posed by an asphalt plant. Since then, a&#13;
number of other such cases have been brought by citizens for the defense of the environment.&#13;
Additionally, Article 87 grants citizens the right to bring a legal action (acci6n de&#13;
cumplimiento) against any public authority to secure full and effective compliance with any&#13;
law or administrative act. Furthermore, under Article 88, citizens may bring legal actions&#13;
(acciones populares) to protect their collective constitutional rights, including those&#13;
pertaining to the environment.&#13;
9.    Colombia has a large and active environmental NGO community, some 260 of which&#13;
are joined with 27 governmental institutions under the umbrella organization ECOFONDO.&#13;
Established in 1993, ECOFONDO functions both as a network of environmental&#13;
organizations and as a private trust fund allocating resources for solving environmental&#13;
problems. ECOFONDO's financial resources come from grants from national and&#13;
international organizations and from funds generated by debt restructuring mechanisms&#13;
agreed to by creditor nations. The latter is expected to provide ECOFONDO with US$ 53&#13;
million between 1993 and 2002 from the US and Canada. These funds will be allocated to a&#13;
number of NGO projects, including environmental education, watershed management, and&#13;
environmental management in urban areas.&#13;
2.    Urban Management&#13;
10.   Urban management in Colombia has recently undergone several important changes.&#13;
In the late 1980s, Colombia set in motion a process of decentralization which included the&#13;
transfer of administrative responsibilities from the national to the local level of government,&#13;
the establishment of national revenue sharing, and the democratic election of mayors and&#13;
district administrative councils. In addition, the Constitution of 1991 further encouraged&#13;
transparency and accountability in urban administration. The Colombian citizenry has&#13;
responded well to these changes, revealing new capacities for local management and&#13;
govemance and supporting continued decentralization of governmental responsibilities.&#13;
11.   Law 152 of 1994 authorizes the establishment of special districts and metropolitan&#13;
areas and defines procedures for development planning at the regional and local levels. The&#13;
cities of Bogota, the national capital, and Barranquilla have been designated special districts;&#13;
Medellin and nine surrounding municipalities have been designated a metropolitan area. Cali&#13;
continues to operate as an independent municipality. Neither the limits of the districts of&#13;
Bogota and Barranquilla nor those of the municipality of Cali comprise however the&#13;
continuous urbanized area of these cities, which in effect extend into the municipalities of&#13;
Soacha, Soledad, and Yumbo, respectively. Since a significant part of the pollution which&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
affects the residents of Bogota, Cali and Barranquilla originates in industries located in the&#13;
neighboring municipalities, environmental planning and pollution control will require effective&#13;
coordination mechanisms between the EMAs and the relevant CARs. Similar coordination is&#13;
needed to address air pollution problems associated with the transportation sector.&#13;
12.   The planning process for Colombian cities, as defined by Law 152, is carried out&#13;
every three years in a six-month exercise, leading to the adoption of a three-year municipal&#13;
development plan. Typically, local plans are developed through a broad-based participatory&#13;
process culminating in approval by the Municipal Council. Each plan includes a three-year&#13;
investment program which forms the basis for annual budgets. Planning activities and studies&#13;
to be carried out during the coming three-year period should be contemplated in the three-&#13;
year investment program and plan.&#13;
13.   Community participation and public involvement in urban management is guaranteed&#13;
through both planning and oversight mechanisms. Law 152 established consultations with&#13;
"territorial planning councils", which represent diverse stakeholders, NGOs and community&#13;
leaders as part of planning procedures for municipalities. Building on a long tradition of&#13;
neighborhood action, the Juntas Administradoras Locales, democratically elected&#13;
neighborhood and district organizations, were given legal status in 1986. These Juntas&#13;
submit proposals for the municipal development plans, and are, in many cases, co-financiers&#13;
and implementing agents of programs defined in the plans. Public oversight of municipal&#13;
management is made effective mostly through individual legal actions defined by the&#13;
Constitution. Through acciones de cumplimiento, officials are held accountable for fulfilling&#13;
campaign promises as spelled out in a "political program". According to Law 99, veedurias&#13;
ciudadanas and acciones de lutela offer citizens legal grounds and procedures on which to&#13;
request a public hearing, to petition and eventually enjoin any public or private sector activity&#13;
or decision which may cause adverse impact on the environment.&#13;
14.   The process of decentralizing administrative responsibilities has been accompanied by&#13;
a parallel effort to both increase local opportunities for generating income and simplify access&#13;
to sources of financing for cities, by unifying eligibility requirements and criteria. While&#13;
secondary cities still depend on revenue sharing from national and departmental government&#13;
budget transfers for some 80 percent of local income, the four largest cities successfully raise&#13;
over half of their income from local tax sources. All cities can borrow from private lenders,&#13;
but the largest source of investment capital is FINDETER, a discounting mechanism which&#13;
allows national funds to be channeled through commercial banks. FINDETER was&#13;
established in 1989 to finance local works relating to water, sanitation, infrastructure, public&#13;
works, education, and health. Its mandate has since been broadened to include works for&#13;
environmental mitigation and prevention. Since FINDETER can cover only part of a&#13;
project's investment costs and no up-front costs of project preparation (e.g. feasibility&#13;
studies), cities frequently seek additional resources from any of several co-financing funds&#13;
available on a matching grants basis (e.g., the Social Investment Fund-FIS, the Fund for&#13;
Urban Infrastructure-INURBE).&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.    Policy Framework&#13;
1.    The National Environmental Policy&#13;
15.   The National Development Plan (El Salto Social) prepared by the Samper&#13;
administration devotes a chapter to promoting sustainable human development, in which the&#13;
key environmental priorities of the National Government for the 1994-1998 period are&#13;
identified. These priority programs are: (i) preservation of strategic ecosystems, (ii)&#13;
improved management of water resources, (iii) restoration of marine and coastal systems, (iv)&#13;
expansion of protected forest areas, (v) improved environmental management in urban areas,&#13;
and (vi) cleaner technology for industrial production.&#13;
16.   The National Council for Economic and Social Policy (CONPES) approved in&#13;
December 1994 Colombia's National Environmental Policy (CONPES Document no. 2750),&#13;
which provides general guidelines for the priority environmental programs defined in the&#13;
National Development Plan. The policy recognizes the special environmental problems which&#13;
affect many of the country's urban areas, resulting in unsustainable patterns of growth,&#13;
exacerbating conditions of poverty and disease, deteriorating the quality of life, and often&#13;
driving the population to occupy areas of high risk or of great agricultural value. The quality&#13;
of the surface waters near urban areas has deteriorated significantly in recent years because of&#13;
uncontrolled discharges. Less than five percent of Colombian cities treat their wastewater&#13;
before discharging them to surface waters. The inadequate management and disposal of solid&#13;
and hazardous wastes contribute to the spread of infectious disease vectors and adversely&#13;
affect public health, particularly of the poorest residents in marginal neighborhoods. The&#13;
urban transport situation in the largest cities is dramatic and significantly affects the quality of&#13;
life of their inhabitants, due particularly to the resulting air pollution and noise levels. The&#13;
inefficient management, increasing loss, and general degradation of urban public spaces also&#13;
impact negatively on the quality of urban life.&#13;
17.   The objective of the urban environmental management program (Programa Mejores&#13;
Ciudades) is to improve the quality of life and health of Colombians who live in urban areas,&#13;
reducing urban pollution, rationalizing public transportation, and restoring public parks and&#13;
open spaces. Fundamental to this effort is the creation and development of environmental&#13;
institutions in the major urban centers. Under this program, MinAmbiente has committed to&#13;
assisting urban areas in the development of integrated environmental policies and programs,&#13;
including appropriate regulatory and economic instruments, and to supporting the preparation&#13;
and implementation of Environmental Action Plans in the largest cities and urban centers. To&#13;
this end, minimum national standards for environmental protection are being established, and&#13;
will need to be monitored and enforced. Programs for the substitution of less-polluting fuels&#13;
and the management of solid and liquid wastes will be developed, and economic incentives&#13;
for pollution control will be put in place. Decentralized implementation, with strong public&#13;
participation, reliance on the market, and partnerships with the private sector where possible&#13;
are encouraged. In addition, the Government of Colombia will underwrite and co-finance&#13;
certain environmental restoration projects in urban areas.&#13;
-7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.    The National Urban Policy&#13;
18.   In addition to its focus on human sustainable development, the National Development&#13;
Plan also defines priority actions in other key areas relating to urban issues: habitat,&#13;
governability, decentralization and regional development, and participation and civil society.&#13;
19.   With respect to habitat, the plan defines three priority issues: (i) overcrowding and&#13;
precarious housing conditions; (ii) inadequate social infrastructure; and (iii) insufficient&#13;
coverage of public services. For the latter, it proposes the multisectoral Plan de Aguas with&#13;
goals of 90 percent coverage in water and 77 percent in sanitation by 1998, modernization of&#13;
the sector and improved water quality. While the first three goals will be addressed through&#13;
directed financing from FINDETER, the Fund for Urban Infrastructure, and others,&#13;
MinAmbiente is expected to offer technical and financial assistance to the four largest cities&#13;
under a program to optimize resources, protect sources of potable water and specifically to&#13;
reduce pollution in reservoirs and other bodies of water into which wastewater is discharged.&#13;
MinAmbiente will also collaborate with the National Institute of Geology and Mines&#13;
(INGEOMINAS) for the exploration and rationalization of water sources.&#13;
20.   With respect to decentralization and regional development, the national policy&#13;
framework emphasizes the importance of "consensus and citizen participation to increase&#13;
social capital" throughout the processes of program planning and management, control and&#13;
evaluation. Continued commitment to decentralization is to be achieved by strengthening the&#13;
management capacities of local institutions, both governmental and non-governmental, and&#13;
by streamlining and strengthening the system of regional financing and increasing the sources&#13;
of funds. One of MinAmbiente's tasks is to assist in the development of the environmental&#13;
agencies in the largest cities, including the preparation of environmental action plans. In&#13;
addition, the National Government expressly offers to guarantee financing or co-financing for&#13;
priority environmental programs, such as management of hazardous and hospital wastes, and&#13;
decontamination of fuels.&#13;
21.   Under citizen participation and civil society, the National Government commits to&#13;
strengthening the role of NGOs in governance and to creating a special fund for citizen&#13;
participation. The fund, as specified in Law 134 of 1994, would co-finance research and&#13;
activities oriented towards increasing citizen participation carried out by universities, NGOs&#13;
and private organizations. The importance given to stakeholders and to non-governmental&#13;
advisors in the planning process is reflected in the creation of ECOFONDO, described above.&#13;
C.    Strategy for Strengthening the SINA&#13;
22.   Colombia has made impressive progress in the past few years in redesigning its legal&#13;
and institutional framework for environmental management. Since the enactment of Law 99,&#13;
regulations have been adopted on environmental licensing and air emission standards for fixed&#13;
and mobile sources. A National Environmental Policy has been prepared and is one of the&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
four major priorities of the Samper Administration's National Development Plan. Although&#13;
created in December 1993, MinAmbiente only began operating in mid-1994 but has since&#13;
then made substantial progress in creating or strengthening the national, regional, and&#13;
municipal institutions that make up the SINA: establishing the five Scientific Research&#13;
Institutes, developing the National Environmental Information System (NEIS), and&#13;
strengthening the CARs and EMAs directly in charge of environmental management in the&#13;
different regions and major urban centers of the country. In some cases, institutions are being&#13;
built up anew; in most, however, the SINA is drawing on existing structures and staff (for&#13;
instance, from the existing and former CARs and the now defunct INDERENA). Substantial&#13;
redesign, however, is being undertaken even in these cases. Major constraints and challenges&#13;
to be faced by these agencies in the near-term include: (a) the clear definition of their&#13;
mandate and division of responsibilities with other environment-related agencies (including&#13;
those in the urban infrastructure sector), at the local, regional and national levels; (b)&#13;
preparation of technical guidelines (e.g., terms of reference for licensing projects) and&#13;
operating procedures (e.g., for enforcement of appropriate standards and agreed-upon&#13;
measures by both the public and private sectors); (c) staffing in appropriate numbers and&#13;
qualification; (d) availability of office facilities, monitoring and laboratory equipment; and (e)&#13;
sufficient funding to carry out mandated activities.&#13;
23.   Environmental agencies, at the national, regional or local levels will all face competing&#13;
demands from the private sector (e.g., oil and power companies, consulting firms) and the&#13;
educational sector (e.g., universities) for environmental specialists. Fortunately the civil&#13;
service in Colombia is fairly competitive in terms of remuneration, benefits, and terms and&#13;
conditions of employment, so these institutions should be able to attract and retain qualified&#13;
university graduates. However, this will vary among the various institutions. MinAmbiente&#13;
is in the strongest position, being at the national level, and is already filling its key positions&#13;
with experienced professionals. Disparities can be expected among the urban institutions,&#13;
however, where each has its own pay scale and municipal civil service tradition. The public&#13;
sector in certain urban centers (e.g., Medellin and Cali) has a reputation for excellence and&#13;
should have no trouble competing with the private sector. Furthermore, the environmental&#13;
arena is seen as an attractive and expanding career field, one where public service can be a&#13;
useful stepping stone to a more lucrative career in the private sector.&#13;
24.   MinAmbiente currently has at its disposal projects with both the World Bank (i.e., the&#13;
Natural Resource Management Project, Ln. 3692, FY94, and the Industrial Restructuring&#13;
Project, Ln. 3321, FY91)) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to support its&#13;
institution building efforts. The Bank's Natural Resource Management Project (US$ 85&#13;
million total project cost) is assisting MinAmbiente with developing a National Forest Policy&#13;
and supporting selected CARs in watershed rehabilitation and parks management. The&#13;
Industrial Restructuring Project (US$ 200 million) has, through one of its components,&#13;
provided technical assistance to revise and expand the regulatory framework, focusing&#13;
especially on ambient quality and emissions standards, and to develop a proposal for the&#13;
creation of an environmental monitoring network and a system of reference laboratories. The&#13;
IDB's Environmental Management Program (US$ 125 million), approved in the beginning of&#13;
1995, has an institutional strengthening component (including training and environmental&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
education) for MinAmbiente and ten participating CARs. It will also support the&#13;
establishment of the NEIS by providing technical assistance to IDEAM for the overall design&#13;
of the system.&#13;

25.   MinAmbiente has been putting in place its technical staff and completing the&#13;
formation of the various units which make up its organizational structure (see Figure 2). It&#13;
absorbed a number of experienced technical staff who had been working on environmental&#13;
management issues in DNP (including the Project Implementation Units of the Bank- and&#13;
IDB-financed projects described earlier), to which it has added experienced personnel, from&#13;
INDERENA, academia and the consulting establishment. Its five general directorates&#13;
(direcciones) are now functioning with a total staff of around 400 and a budget of US$ 37.6&#13;
million in 1995. The Direcci6n General de Asentamientos Humanosy Poblaci6n (DAHP)&#13;
will address issues relating to the urban environment and will be in charge of implementing&#13;
the Programa Mejores Ciudades described above, in collaboration with other departments in&#13;
MinAmbiente. DAHP is responsible for providing policy guidance and technical support to&#13;
the different regional, departmental and municipal institutions in charge of environmental&#13;
management in the urban areas of Colombia. DAHP's mandate thus comprises: providing&#13;
policy advice; preparing regulations; defining appropriate methodologies, procedures and&#13;
administrative mechanisms; facilitating intersectoral and interjurisdictional collaboration; and&#13;
providing technical assistance. DAHP has two subdirectorates, one for Urban Environment&#13;
and the other for Environmental Education. It currently has a staff of 21 higher level&#13;
professionals (including 7 consultants) and a budget of US$ 2.5 million in 1995.&#13;
26.    MinAmbiente's strategy to improve environmental management in Colombian cities in&#13;
the coming years focuses on institutional strengthening, taking into account the distinct&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
mandate established by Law 99 for: (i) the agencies created in Colombia's four largest urban&#13;
areas (Bogota, Cali, Medellin and Barranquilla) which will be directly responsible for&#13;
environmental management in their jurisdiction; and (ii) other institutions of the SINA (the&#13;
CARs, departments and municipalities) which will share responsibility for environmental&#13;
management in other urban areas (i.e., those under one million inhabitants).2 MinAmbiente's&#13;
technical assistance strategy for the improvement of urban environmental management has&#13;
two main objectives: (i) to gradually improve planning, implementation, monitoring, and&#13;
enforcement capacity of local institutions; and (ii) to enable these institutions to respond&#13;
immediately to critical dimensions of their mandate (e.g., environmental licensing).&#13;
27.   The proposed Urban Environmental Management Project, to be implemented over&#13;
four years, is meant to support this strategy. By focusing on assistance to the EMAs, it will&#13;
give priority attention to Colombia's major urban areas, where environmental conditions have&#13;
significantly worsened over the past two decades and where local authorities are under&#13;
greatest pressure to build up the core environmental planning, implementation, monitoring,&#13;
and enforcement capacity needed to reverse these trends. The project thus has a strong&#13;
emphasis, especially in its initial stages, on establishing the institutional and regulatory&#13;
frameworks which are pre-conditions for sound environmental management. It complements&#13;
and is fully consistent with the assistance which is being provided by the Bank and the IDB&#13;
through the projects referred to in para. 25, which, as indicated, cover predominantly natural&#13;
resource management, institutional strengthening for CARs, and improvement of the national&#13;
regulatory framework. In order to reduce the financial burden on the four new (or, in the&#13;
case of Bogota, recently reorganized) EMAs during their first years of operation, the&#13;
Government has opted to make the proceeds of the loan available to these agencies as a&#13;
budgetary transfer, to be matched on equal terms by local funds.&#13;
H.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN COLOMBL'S MAJOR&#13;
CITIES&#13;
28.   Under Law 99 of December 1993, cities of more than one million inhabitants, i.e.&#13;
Santafe de Bogota (6.3 million), Cali (1.8 million), Medellin (1.7 million), and Barranquilla&#13;
(1.0 million), were given the responsibility, under guidance from the MinAmbiente, for&#13;
establishing appropriate institutional/regulatory frameworks and for undertaking the planning,&#13;
implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of environmental and natural resource&#13;
management programs. These activities had previously been assigned to several institutions,&#13;
such as the regional corporations (in the case of licensing of activities, watershed&#13;
management, and others), INDERENA (in the case of natural resource management), and the&#13;
Ministry of Health (in the case of monitoring the levels and effects of pollution), among&#13;
2 A number of departments and small municipalities (e.g. La Mesa, Tolu, Manizales, Bucaramanga) have&#13;
created their own environmental agencies, although formal environmental management responsibilities, in&#13;
these cases, rest primarily with the CARs.&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
others. As of 1995, they have has been transferred to the Departamento T&amp;nico del Medio&#13;
Ambiente (DAMA) of Bogota, created in 1991, and to the EMAs of Cali, Medellin and&#13;
Barranquilla, which have only been in existence since January 1995. This section presents a&#13;
brief overview of the key environmental issues which these agencies will have to address in&#13;
the coming years and of the institutional and financial conditions under which they are&#13;
currently operating.&#13;
A.    Santafe de Bogota&#13;
29.   The population of Santafe de Bogota, of 6.3 million inhabitants, is increasing at a rate&#13;
of 2.5% per year. There is currently a deficit of housing in the city, and many high-risk zones&#13;
(for example, areas prone to flooding and landslides) are being inhabited. The city accounts&#13;
for over 20% of Colombia's GNP, with over 23% of the country's establishments in the&#13;
industrial, services, and business sectors. The city's economy is dominated by the services&#13;
sector (74%), followed by the manufacturing sector (food and beverages, industrial chemicals&#13;
and petrol derivatives, transport materials, textiles, and shoes) which accounts for 22% of&#13;
local production, and finally the construction industry (3%).&#13;
30.   Environmental issues of concern: Santafe de Bogota faces a diverse range of&#13;
environmental problems. Of major concern are air pollution from mobile and industrial&#13;
sources, the contamination of rivers, particularly the Bogota river, noise pollution, and&#13;
pollution from improper solid and hazardous waste disposal. Also relevant are pollution and&#13;
urbanization of wetlands, degradation of soil and vegetation due to exploitation of quarries&#13;
and urbanization of the hills, lack and inadequate usage of green areas, visual pollution and&#13;
invasion of parks and streets by vendors. Although in general linked to structural factors&#13;
such as fast population growth and the social and economic conditions of the population,&#13;
these environmental problems are aggravated by gaps in planning and limited awareness&#13;
about the environment.&#13;
31.   The urban area of Bogota has three principal rivers (Salitre, Fucha, and Tunjuelo) and&#13;
four smaller tributaries, which all drain into the Bogota river. The city's BOD5 load is about&#13;
500 tons/day. It is estimated that 90% of this load reaches the Bogota river, which on&#13;
average receives 15 cubic meters of wastewater per second, with peaks of the order of&#13;
41 m3/s. The Bogota river also carries a number of heavy metals, such as lead, iron, chrome,&#13;
and mercury, which originate in the city of Bogota, to the Magdalena River. It is estimated&#13;
that about half a million people in the city are directly exposed to these waters, and in some&#13;
downstream municipalities, this contaminated water is used for crop irrigation.&#13;
32.   The domestic and industrial sectors are the principal sources of solid waste and water&#13;
pollution. In the case of solid waste, 77% stems from domestic sources, and the remaining&#13;
23% from industry, businesses, market places, and hospitals. The coverage of solid waste&#13;
collection is 95%; the remaining 200-400 tons of rubbish is thrown into the river or canals, or&#13;
left in the streets. The waste residues are currently neither separated, nor recycled (including&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
hazardous waste and biological residues from hospitals). The city's landfill, Dofia Juana,&#13;
receives 4,643 tons of solid waste per day. Due to inadequate drainage of the landfill,&#13;
leachates and the overflow of rain water end up in the nearby Tunjuelo river.&#13;
33.   The transport sector accounts for between 60-70% of air pollution in Bogota. It is&#13;
estimated that currently there are about 879,000 vehicles in the city, and this number is&#13;
increasing at a rate of about 5% annually. The road network, however, on average is&#13;
increasing at a rate of about 1%. The ensuing urban gridlock, coupled with the over 14-year&#13;
average age of vehicles, and the tendency for thermal atmospheric inversions in the city,&#13;
result in high levels of local air pollution. Air pollutants from transport sources include 9,250&#13;
tons/year of nitrogen oxides (which account for 82% of total NO,, emissions in the city),&#13;
1,269 tons/year of sulfur dioxides (accounting for 16% of total SO, emissions), 288,433&#13;
tons/year of carbon monoxide, and 19,845 tons/year of hydrocarbons. Industry accounts for&#13;
approximately 82% of total sulfur dioxide emissions, and 95% of total particulate emissions&#13;
in the city. The principal source of noise pollution is also the transport sector, in particular&#13;
from automobile and bus traffic; air traffic is also an important, but more localized source of&#13;
disturbance. In some downtown streets, noise levels above 80 dB, for greater than 60% of&#13;
time, have been registered.&#13;
34.   Institutional framework: Bogota's Departamento Tecnico Administrativo del&#13;
Medio Ambiente (DAMA) is undoubtedly the most experienced of the four EMAs. Created&#13;
by the passage of Acuerdo 9 in 1990, DAMA's original mandate was to develop and oversee&#13;
the implementation of the environmental management plan of the city. However in 1994, the&#13;
District's Administration, through Decree 322, created the Environmental System of the&#13;
Capital District (SIAC), and restructured DAMA as the EMA for Bogota, pursuant to Law&#13;
99. In 1995, the new District Administration is proposing to restructure DAMA once again&#13;
through a decree expected to be signed by the Mayor this year.&#13;
35.   The functions of DAMA under this new decree will include the following: (i) to&#13;
formulate the environmental policy of the District; (ii) to direct, coordinate and control&#13;
environmental management in the District in harmony with the policies and guidelines of the&#13;
SINA; (iii) to coordinate and lead the implementation of the District's Environmental&#13;
Management Plan; (iv) to design, implement and maintain the Environmental System for the&#13;
District (SIAC); (v) to carry out targeted actions to preserve the environment; (vi) to issue&#13;
norms and standards to control and preserve the ecological heritage of the district; and (vii)&#13;
to manage, administer and control the use of natural resources in coordination with the&#13;
National Policy and other types of arrangements aimed at the preservation, maintenance and&#13;
development of natural resources and the environment in the District.&#13;
36.   The new decree also will establish a new institutional structure for DAMA. This will&#13;
comprise four main departments: planning; environmental quality; development; and legal.&#13;
DAMA is currently being restructured to function in accordance with this decree. The staff&#13;
of DAMA consists of about 122 people, of whom about a quarter are technical specialists.&#13;
To carry out the duties specified in the new decree, current plans are to increase the staff to&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
144 in 1996, adding more environmental specialists (for example, in the areas of regulation,&#13;
air pollution, permits/licenses etc.). In addition, the training of existing staff will be needed.&#13;
37.   Other current institutional constraints include: the need to develop inter-institutional&#13;
coordination mechanisms with other district-level agencies and hence to play a role in urban&#13;
planning activities, the need to clarify jurisdiction and responsibilities with other&#13;
environmental institutions, such as the Corporaci6n Aut6noma Regional de Cundinamarca,&#13;
and lack of technological resources to carry out newly assigned functions such as monitoring&#13;
and control of pollution and natural resource management and for the establishment and&#13;
operation of an environmental information system. An Environmental Management Plan for&#13;
the district of Bogota was prepared at the end of the previous administration and will be&#13;
revised and updated under the presently proposed project. One of DAMA's priorities is to&#13;
consolidate the 22 local (neighborhood) environmental centers. This would build on the&#13;
significant effort of promoting citizen participation on environmental matters undertaken by&#13;
the previous administration, which, among other activities, prepared environmental agendas&#13;
(assessments) for each neighborhood.&#13;
38.   Financial issues: Just over 6% of the total budget for 1995 for the District&#13;
corresponds to investment for environmental issues (70,824 million pesos or approximately&#13;
US$ 83 million). The investment budget for DAMA for 1995 is about a quarter of this&#13;
amount, i.e. 17,331 million pesos (about US$ 20 million), with over half this income arising&#13;
from the property tax and the remainder from transfers from funds, the District&#13;
Administration, among other sources. Of this budget, about 85% (15,125 million pesos) is&#13;
earmarked for one project: the recuperation of the Bogota river. This skewing of the budget&#13;
for this one item improves with time: in 1998, this item accounts for just under 50% of&#13;
DAMA's total investment budget, with the budget for control of environmental pollution and&#13;
for training increasing in the intervening years. By 1998, there is also a slight increase in&#13;
DAMA's investment budget to 29,189 million pesos. It is also estimated that DAMA will&#13;
have access to an income of about 123,813 million pesos (US$ 146 million) for the period&#13;
1995-1998, stemming from several sources, including the use of economic instruments.&#13;
B.    Santiago de Cali&#13;
39.   Santiago de Cali is a city of 1.8 million people. The population density in the city&#13;
varies considerably among different income levels, with densities as high as 307 inhabitants&#13;
per hectare in the lowest income groups, compared with 127 inhabitants per hectare in the&#13;
medium-to-high and highest income groups. This disparity between income groups is also&#13;
apparent in other urban indicators, such as availability of drinking water, waste collection and&#13;
level of green space per person. Cali is located in the Cauca River Valley, with much&#13;
industry being located in the area between Cali and the neighboring municipality of Yumbo.&#13;
A survey from 1989 indicated the existence of 884 industrial establishments in this zone,&#13;
including highly polluting industries, such as pulp and paper and chemical production.&#13;
Informal industries are also located throughout the city.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40.   Environmental issues of concern: The principal environmental problem faced by&#13;
the city of Cali is pollution of its water resources due to discharge of untreated wastewater.&#13;
Other environmental problems include: air pollution due to emissions from the transport and&#13;
industrial sectors; loss of biodiversity; deforestation; uncontrolled growth of the city and land&#13;
use planning deficiencies, in particular relating to industrial siting adjacent to residential areas;&#13;
lack of green areas in the city, and occupation of existing green areas and public spaces; a rise&#13;
in noise levels; inadequate disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and usage of&#13;
environmentally unfriendly practices for mining. Lack of environmental education aggravates&#13;
many of these problems. Air and water pollution in the city result to a large extent from the&#13;
neighboring municipality of Yumbo, highlighting the need for coordination between the EMA&#13;
and the CAR concerned (Cotporaci6n Aut6noma Regional del Valle del Cauca, CVC).&#13;
41.   Several rivers (Pance, Lili, Cafiaveralejo, Melendez, Aguacatal, Cali, and Jamundi)&#13;
cross the city and drain into the Cauca river. The average flow of these rivers (apart from the&#13;
Cauca) is low, under 6 cubic meters per second; whereas the Cauca on average has a flow&#13;
rate of over 300 m3/s. All wastewater from domestic and industrial sources from Cali and the&#13;
surrounding municipalities eventually ends up in the Cauca river. Cali's water utility,&#13;
Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI) is responsible for monitoring water quality.&#13;
Monitoring of water quality indicates (data from CVC, 1989) that BOD5 load in the Cauca&#13;
river stemming from Cali is 80 tons/day, made up of 64 tons/day from the domestic sector,&#13;
and the remaining 16 tons/day from the industrial sector. This load is about 25% of the total&#13;
organic material load emitted into the Cauca river from the total CVC area. Interestingly,&#13;
sugar refineries, pulp and paper industry, and coffee cultivation in the area account for&#13;
another 25-30% of this total load.&#13;
42.   Municipal solid waste collection and disposal is handled by the utility, Empresa de&#13;
Servicios Varios (EMSIRVA). The landfill used by EMSIRVA is located in a rural area, but&#13;
presents several environmental problems relating to leaching due to its proximity to the&#13;
Cauca river and high levels of groundwater in the area. Waste collection coverage in the city&#13;
is about 80%, with over 70% (1,100 tons/day) of the waste stemming from industry. There&#13;
is a recycling program in the city, under which about 60 tons of waste are recycled daily.&#13;
43.   There is little data available on air quality. However, one of the main sources of air&#13;
pollution in this area is probably the industrial sector. Results of a 1989 survey of the&#13;
industrial zone in Cali-Yumbo show that the principal air pollutant is particulate matter (34,&#13;
928 tons/year), which stems from the food industry (41%), pulp and paper (33%), cement&#13;
(12%), and steel (9%). Other pollutants, such as S02 (10, 389 tons/year) originate from the&#13;
pulp and paper (59%), cement (35%) and chemicals (6%) industries; and NO, (2,417&#13;
tons/year) from the cement (54%) and food (43%) industries.&#13;
44.   Institutional framework: The EMA of Cali, the Departamento de Gesti6n del&#13;
Medio Ambiente (DAGMA) was created by the passage of Acuerdo 18 in December 1994.&#13;
This acuerdo also established the environmental management system for the Municipality of&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Cali, which (i) seeks to coordinate environmental activities of both private and public entities,&#13;
and (ii) lays down the actions and resources to consolidate the EMA and strengthen the&#13;
capacity for municipal environmental management, on the basis of institutional development&#13;
programs, the Municipal Development Plan, and plans and programs of environmental&#13;
development. Under the Acuerdo, DAGMA has the role of coordinator and guide of the&#13;
municipal environmental management system. Specific areas covered by DAGMA are the&#13;
following: (i) social issues, e.g. population and demographics, environmental education,&#13;
community participation, environmental management; (ii) protection of air quality and noise&#13;
pollution; (iii) protection of water resources; (iv) adequate disposal of solid wastes; (v)&#13;
protection and conservation of watersheds; (vi) protection and conservation of land, e.g.&#13;
against deforestation, erosion, forest fires, unsustainable land usage etc.; (vii) protection and&#13;
conservation of public spaces; and (viii) protection and conservation of biodiversity.&#13;
45.   Acuerdo 18/94 also specifies the internal organization of DAGMA, as well as sources&#13;
of finance for the system. The internal organization for DAGMA consists of a Director, an&#13;
administrative department, a legal department, and four main sub-directions: (i) planning,&#13;
which advises the director on the elaboration of the municipal environmental management&#13;
plan and the systems for following and evaluating the plan; (ii) environmental quality, which&#13;
interacts with the private sector and public agencies; (iii) environmental education, which&#13;
interacts with citizens and formal and non-formal municipal organizations; and (iv)&#13;
environmental projects, which formulates the policy for municipal environmental management&#13;
with the aid of the other organizations which make up the municipal environmental&#13;
management system, and executes environmental investment projects.&#13;
46.   Currently, DAGMA's staff consists of 34 people. It is expected that in 1996, this&#13;
number will increase to 68. The staff is hired at the moment on a contract basis, but from&#13;
January 1996 staff will be regularized. There is curr-ently a lack of specialist staff, particularly&#13;
in the areas of laws and regulation, economic instruments, monitoring and control of&#13;
pollution. However, DAGMA has recently started a training program in environmental&#13;
management for existing staff through the local university. Other acute institutional problems&#13;
that are hampering DAGMA from fulfilling its role as EMA include the newness of the&#13;
institution and hence the lack of interinstitutional coordination mechanisms between entities&#13;
at the municipal and regional level, lack of operating procedures and knowledge on specialist&#13;
topics as described above, and lack of environmental monitoring and control equipment.&#13;
Some of these problems are made more acute due to the lack of existing environmental&#13;
information and data. However, DAGMA is part of an experienced local administration,&#13;
which has responded proactively to the demands of Law 99, as evidenced by the thorough&#13;
institutional analysis and intensive process of consultation undertaken by the previous&#13;
administration during the latter half of 1994 in order to reach agreement on the organization&#13;
of the new EMA. It is expected that this institutional environment will provide important&#13;
support for DAGMA during the initial stages of its activitv.&#13;
47.   Financial issues: Just under 5% of the total budget for 1995 for the Municipality&#13;
corresponds to resources for environment (4,152 million pesos or approx. US$ 5 million).&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The budget for DAGMA for 1995 is about 88% of this amount, i.e. 3,652 million pesos&#13;
(about US$ 4.3 million), of which about half is allocated for recuperation of public spaces.&#13;
DAGMA's budget indicates that there is no transfer of income from the Municipality for&#13;
1995, the major source of income being the property surcharge. The total projected income&#13;
for 1996 and 1997 for DAGMA are 8,741 million pesos (US$ 10.3 million) and 11,045&#13;
million pesos (US$ 13 million) respectively, with increases mainly due to greater income from&#13;
the property surcharge and economic instruments, such as user charges.&#13;
C.    Medellin/Valle de Aburra&#13;
48.   A total of ten municipalities3 are located in the Aburra Valley, with Medellin at the&#13;
nucleus. These, together, constitute the Metropolitan Area of the Aburra Valley (AREA),&#13;
which in total has jurisdiction over about 1,152 square kilometers: 14% urban, 71% rural,&#13;
and 15% peri-urban land areas. The Census of 1993 put Medellin's population at about 1.7&#13;
million inhabitants, and the Aburra Valley's population at about 2.6 million. It is estimated&#13;
that about 51.4% of AREA's population live in conditions below the poverty line. This&#13;
situation has sparked much urban violence in the area since 1991. The Valley of AburrA is&#13;
also prone to natural disasters, such as flooding, landslides and earthquakes.&#13;
49.   Environmental issues of concern: Environmental problems in Medellin include the&#13;
following: water pollution, particularly of the Medellin river, air pollution, especially that&#13;
stemming from the transport sector, and land degradation/erosion due to quarrying and&#13;
deforestation.&#13;
50.   The Medellin river cuts through the Aburra Valley, receiving as many as 200 streams&#13;
which start in the surrounding mountains. Over a quarter of these flow through the&#13;
Municipality of Medellin. 98.4% of AREA's population receive potable water from the&#13;
public service company. The local utility is conducting a number of water conservation&#13;
campaigns aimed at industry. However, all wastewater from domestic and industrial sources&#13;
is directly disposed of either in the streams leading to the Medellin river or in the river itself&#13;
This has given rise to a BOD5 load of 115 tons/day (of which about 30% stems from the&#13;
industrial sector) in the river.&#13;
51.   The transport sector contributed about 90% of emissions to the atmosphere in 1992,&#13;
with the industrial sector accounting for 4.6%, and other activities, such as mining,&#13;
construction and demolition, for the remaining 5.4% of total emissions in the Aburra Valley.&#13;
There has been a large increase in the number of personal cars in the Metropolitan Area:&#13;
between 1986 and 1991, the average annual increase was about 4%; this suddenly increased&#13;
to 12% in 1993 as a result of the open import policy instituted in 1991. The rate of road&#13;
construction is however decreasing: 5.5 km of roads were built in 1987, compared with 0.8&#13;
km in 1992. The increasing congestion and traffic violations contribute further to air&#13;
3 The ten municipalities are Bello, Copacabana, Barbosa, Girardota, Medellin, Envigado, Itagui, Caldas,&#13;
Estrella and Sabaneta.&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
pollution. A first section of the metro rail system, currently under construction, in Medellin is&#13;
expected to be opened later this year and should have a positive impact on air pollution in the&#13;
valley.&#13;
52.   The Metropolitan Area of the Aburra Valley produces about 1,400 tons of solid waste&#13;
per day. About 98% of this is collected and deposited in a sanitary landfill, which has been in&#13;
operation since 1984, and which has an expected life through 2007. 57 % of the waste&#13;
comes directly from Medellin, through its public works company; the remainder is supplied&#13;
from companies of neighboring cities. Only about 5% of the waste (primarily glass and&#13;
paper) in the landfill is recycled for the Aburra Valley. Uncollected garbage (2% of total,&#13;
generally stemming from remote areas beyond the access of collection vehicles) is generally&#13;
thrown into streams and ravines feeding into the Medellin river, or left on streets. This waste&#13;
degrades in the river and contributes to the total contaminant load. The sanitary landfill also&#13;
produces leachates, which make their way through the underground water system to the&#13;
Medellin river, thus further degrading water quality. Waste degradation in the landfill also&#13;
results in gas (methane) production and release to the atmosphere.&#13;
53.   Institutional framework: After the passage of Law 99, the Metropolitan&#13;
Government approved Acuerdo 12 in December 1994, creating two additional divisions,&#13;
Environment and Metropolitan Planning, in addition to the existing three divisions (Legal and&#13;
Administrative Services, Finance and Technical) in the Metropolitan Authority (AREA). In&#13;
1995, another Acuerdo (3/95) was passed, which changed the structure of these divisions,&#13;
renaming them as "units" under the leadership of a unit manager. At the moment, a project is&#13;
underway to reorganize the Metropolitan Environmental System (SIMA) and to better define&#13;
the function of the Environmental Unit in the Metropolitan Authority. The current proposal&#13;
is to establish four divisions within the unit: environmental control, natural resources, human&#13;
settlements, and environmental information system. Currently, the number of staff in the&#13;
Environmental Unit is 16, and is expected to increase to 23 by the end of 1995.&#13;
54.   AREA faces a number of institutional and organizational issues with the establishment&#13;
of the SIMA and the consolidation of the EMA. First, and probably most important, is the&#13;
perception of environment as a specialist subject, associated with ecological problems only.&#13;
Second, there is a lack of public awareness of environmental issues, which aggravates further&#13;
the first issue. Third, although AREA has some experience with industrial audits and&#13;
monitoring air quality (REDAIRE has been in existence for almost two years with ten air&#13;
quality monitoring stations), there is still much to be done with regard to standardizing the&#13;
monitoring procedures and developing emissions standards for air and wastewater emissions.&#13;
It can draw, however, on considerable technical expertise and managerial experience which&#13;
is available in the Empresas Pzublicas de Medellin (which manage water and sanitation,&#13;
power, and other public services) and on a tradition of good inter-municipal coordination&#13;
within the metropolitan government.&#13;
55.   Financial issues: Income solely from the property surcharge is 3,950 million pesos&#13;
(US$ 4.6 million) for 1995, increasing to 7,224 million pesos (US$ 8.5 million) for 1998.&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D.    Barranquilla&#13;
56.   In 1993, the district of Barranquilla had a population of 1.09 million inhabitants and&#13;
one of the highest densities in the world at 6,958 inhabitants per square kilometer.&#13;
Projections indicate that just under 30% of the city's population live in dwellings with&#13;
subnormal conditions. The city is a major business and financial center on the Caribbean&#13;
Coast, and as a result population migration is significant. There is also a large industrial&#13;
sector in the area, which accounted for about 33% of GNP in 1992. Types of industry in the&#13;
area include food and drink products, textiles, tanneries, furniture, pulp and paper, chemicals,&#13;
rubber, plastics, and metal products.&#13;
57.   Environmental issues of concern: High levels of water pollution of the streams&#13;
flowing through the district of Barranquilla into the Magdalena river is the prime&#13;
environmental concern. Other environmental issues include inadequate solid waste disposal,&#13;
air pollution, noise pollution, and bad management of public space. There is also a lack of&#13;
existing environmental information and data.&#13;
58.   The District produces 1,000 tons of rubbish a day, of which about 70% is collected by&#13;
one enterprise, and the remainder by smaller community enterprises (informal collection).&#13;
The former disposes of waste, without separation, into a landfill El Henequen, which in the&#13;
last five years of usage is already one fifth full. The latter however, dispose of the rubbish in&#13;
open dumps mainly in the southwest part of the city. 66% of the waste is generated from&#13;
domestic sources. Classification of the waste in El Henequen shows the following&#13;
composition: organic material (58%), paper and cardboard (24%), plastic (4%), glass (2%),&#13;
metal (2%), and other (10%), showing the high level of recycling of glass and metal.&#13;
59.   The most important body of water is the Magdalena river, which borders the city for&#13;
about 19.5 km. It has a high existing organic contaminant load by this stage, as it carries a&#13;
waste load from the seven states through which it passes before reaching Barranquilla.&#13;
Another heavily polluted body of water is the Cienaga de Mallorquin, which until 5 years&#13;
ago was the disposal site of all the solid waste produced in Barranquilla. In addition, the&#13;
streams and creeks (canos) that pass through the city and empty into the Magdalena river, are&#13;
highly polluted as they are recipients of all domestic wastewater generated in the city. There&#13;
is no readily available data on the type and extent of the pollution in these water systems.&#13;
Availability of drinking water is also a problem, with only 70% of the city receiving adequate&#13;
supplies from the water utility Triple A. The sewerage system covers only about 54% of the&#13;
population. Other related problems include the lack of adequate drainage of rain water,&#13;
resulting in flooding in parts of the city during the rainy season.&#13;
60.   The transport sector is a major source of air pollution. It is estimated that there are&#13;
120,000 public and private vehicles, of which about 3,000 are buses, 10,500 are taxis and the&#13;
remainder cars. The average age of vehicles is high, with 60% of the buses and 35% of the&#13;
cars over 15 years old. Fuels used include natural gas (44%), diesel (10%), and gasoline&#13;
(46%) for public vehicles, and gasoline (93%) and diesel (7%) for private cars. An important&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
factor also is traffic congestion in the city center due to the inadequacy of the road network&#13;
and traffic violations. The transport sector also is the major source of noise, with levels as&#13;
high as 300 dB in parts of the city. There is little data on the contribution of industrial&#13;
sources to air pollution, but certain industries such as ammonium sulfate production, cement,&#13;
gypsum/plaster, and pulp and paper appear to be major emitters to the atmosphere.&#13;
61.   Institutional framework: The Departamento Administrativo Distrital delMedio&#13;
Ambiente (DADIMA) was created by the passage of Acuerdo 45 in December 1994 by the&#13;
District Council of Barranquilla. DADIMA is the maximum environmental authority and is&#13;
responsible for governing and coordinating the environmental system of the District. Since&#13;
DADIMA's creation, its Board (Junta Directiva) has approved six acuerdos. These relate to&#13;
the following: (i) the statutes of DADIMA, (ii) the provisional staffing plan, (iii) provisional&#13;
functions and requirements for the staff to carry out their duties, (iv) the budget for&#13;
DADIMA, (v) provisional organization and functions of SIADIBA (the local SINA of&#13;
Barranquilla), and (vi) the organogram and functions of departments in DADIMA.&#13;
62.   The current staff of 26 in DADIMA include 16 environmental professionals. There&#13;
are plans to expand the total number of staff to 40 people in 1996. The organogram of&#13;
DADIMA shows the following institutional structure: a Board to which the director reports&#13;
and which in turn reports to the Mayor; a director who receives input from a technical&#13;
committee and the Environment District Council, and who has the Environmental District&#13;
Fund (FONANDI) under his direct control; and four divisions/units which report directly to&#13;
the director. These are (i) the general unit for the environment, (ii) the legal division, (iii) the&#13;
administrative and finance division, and (iv) the planning and information systems division.&#13;
The first of these, the environmental unit is made up of three divisions, which deal with the&#13;
urban environment and environmental education, the physical environment, and forestry and&#13;
rural affairs. It also has direct authority over the environmental laboratory and local&#13;
(neighborhood) environmental units.&#13;
63.   DADIMA faces many institutional and organizational issues. Barranquilla has had&#13;
traditionally the weakest administration of the four major cities of Colombia. This is reflected&#13;
in the lack of local staff with the necessary expertise in environmental matters, no significant&#13;
previous history in the city of any institution carrying out this mandate and hence a lack of&#13;
methodology, equipment, and environmental data, and a low awareness of environmental&#13;
issues in the city. Much progress was made, however, in recent years, in improving the&#13;
effectiveness and accountability of the administration, with a strong emphasis on developing&#13;
mechanisms of public participation in various aspects of urban management. Even so, it is&#13;
envisaged that, of the four EMAs, Barranquilla's DADIMA will require the most support in&#13;
its formative stage.&#13;
64.   Financial issues: The budget for DADIMA for 1995 is 3,900 million pesos (about&#13;
US$ 4.6 million). DADIMA identifies two main possible sources of income in the coming&#13;
years: (a) the property tax share or property surcharge; and (b) transfers from the electricity&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sector. Estimates show that projected income could rise to about 5,681 million pesos (US$&#13;
6.7 million) from these sources for 1998.&#13;
m.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.   Project Objectives&#13;
65.   The primary objective of the project is to support implementation of Colombia's&#13;
National Environmental Policy and the improvement of environmental management capacity&#13;
in the country's urban areas through (a) strengthening MinAmbiente's capacity to provide&#13;
policy advice and technical assistance to Colombian cities and (b) strengthening&#13;
environmental management agencies (EMAs) in the urban centers of Bogota, Cali, Medellin,&#13;
and Barranquilla. In support of this primary objective, the project would also help establish&#13;
those components of the National Environmental Information System (NEIS), both at the&#13;
national and local levels, which are instrumental to the improvement of urban environmental&#13;
management.&#13;
66.   The expected outcomes of the project are improved environmental management in the&#13;
country's main urban areas, which, over time, would result in control and, possibly,&#13;
reduction in urban pollution levels, rationalization of urban land use, and restoration of urban&#13;
ecosystems.&#13;
B.    Project Description&#13;
67.   The technical assistance project would consist of two components:&#13;
(a)   Component 1: Design and Implementation of a Technical Assistance Strategy&#13;
through MinAmbiente/DAJP for Cities of Less Than One Million Inhabitants&#13;
(Total project cost: US$ 9.2 m.); and&#13;
(b)   Component 2: Institutional Strengthening of the Environmental Management&#13;
Agencies of the Country's Four Main Urban Centers (Total project cost: US$&#13;
30.8 m.).&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.    Component 1: Design and Implementation of a Technical Assistance&#13;
Strategy, through MinAmbiente, for Cities of Less Than One Million&#13;
Inhabitants&#13;
68.   This component is designed to assist MinAmbiente, and the Directorate of Human&#13;
Settlements and Population (DAHP) in particular, to carry out its mandate, as defined in Law&#13;
99 and in the National Development Plan, as the focal point for environmental policy&#13;
guidance, intersectoral and interinstitutional coordination, and implementation of the&#13;
Programa Mejores Ciudades, which aims at reducing urban pollution and strengthening the&#13;
management of environmental resources. DAHP is structured into two departments&#13;
(subdirecciones): (i) Urban Environment, Human Settlements and Population; and (ii)&#13;
Environmental Education. It currently has a staff of 21 higher level professionals (of which&#13;
7 are short-term consultants) and 4 support staff In order to fulfill its mandate, it will need&#13;
to acquire a small number of permanent staff, which can be complemented by consultants to&#13;
carry out specific tasks. Adequate office space and equipment are also needed. In addition,&#13;
it is expected that DAHP will coordinate with those departments in MinAmbiente which may&#13;
be encharged with or partly involved in implementation of specific activities related to the&#13;
Programa Mejores Ciudades and the proposed project.&#13;
69.   MinAmbiente's strategy for strengthening institutions of the SINA which are&#13;
responsible for urban environmental management, as stated in paragraph 27, distinguishes&#13;
between: (i) the country's four cities with population above one million, in which the local&#13;
(municipal, district or metropolitan) administration is charged with environmental&#13;
management within its jurisdiction; and (ii) other urban areas in which authority over&#13;
environmental issues is to be exercised by the respective CAR, in coordination with local&#13;
authorities (departments and municipalities). This component seeks to support the design and&#13;
implementation MinAmbiente's technical assistance strategy, for urban administrations of&#13;
under one million inhabitants. (Institutional strengthening for the four largest cities of&#13;
Colombia is addressed in Component 2.) It comprises both planning activities targeted to&#13;
specific urban areas, and activities, such as studies and training, of relevance to environmental&#13;
management in urban areas in general.&#13;
70.   The activities to be financed under the component are:&#13;
(a)   Design of MinAmbiente's Technical Assistance Strategy. The project will&#13;
finance local and international consultant services, totaling approximately 60&#13;
person-months and US$ 300,000, to assist MinAmbiente in the detailed design&#13;
and implementation of a technical assistance strategy for improving&#13;
environmental management in urban areas. The strategy will include4: (i) the&#13;
preparation of environmental action plans in a number of cities of national&#13;
interest (other than the four urban areas included in Component 2); and (ii)&#13;
4 In addition to the assistance to be provided to the four urban centers in Component 2.&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technical support for CARs, departments, and municipalities, comprising&#13;
urban environmental management tools, studies, training, and the development&#13;
of an information system, as described in sections (b) through (e) of this&#13;
paragraph.&#13;
(b)    Development of Local Planning Tools and Planning Exercises. The project&#13;
will finance local and international consultant services (approximately 150&#13;
person-months) and related training workshops and consultations, totaling&#13;
US$ 1.15 million, for the design and implementation of a range of local&#13;
planning tools and planning exercises, including the following:&#13;
(i)    Classifying urban areas and setting priorities for environmental&#13;
management support;&#13;
(ii)    Defining methodologies for local environmental planning appropriate&#13;
to the range of institutional, technical, and financial capacity in urban&#13;
areas in the country;&#13;
(iii)    Supporting the preparation of environmental action plans for cities&#13;
with a population approaching one million inhabitants, cities&#13;
neighboring but not included in the large urban centers (i.e., Soacha,&#13;
Yumbo and Soledad), and other mid-sized cities, industrial corridors&#13;
or urban areas of special interest with critical environmental problems';&#13;
(iv)    Developing the mechanisms to ensure that the environmental criteria&#13;
set forth in the environmental action plans referred to in (iii) above are&#13;
incorporated in the corresponding urban development plans; and&#13;
(v)    Developing the mechanisms to enable CARs to assist cities other than&#13;
those selected under (iii) above in the preparation of environmental&#13;
action plans.&#13;
(c)    Studies. The project will finance local and international consultant services,&#13;
totaling approximately 290 person-months and US$ 2.66 million, to carry out&#13;
analytical studies to assist MinAmbiente, in collaboration with sectoral and&#13;
local public entities (i.e, CARs, departments and municipalities), to identify&#13;
and address common and typical urban environmental problems (e.g., in water&#13;
and sanitation, solid and industrial wastes, air pollution), develop sectoral&#13;
management strategies, and formulate the appropriate technical assistance&#13;
programs through which MinAmbiente might further support their&#13;
implementation. The project will also finance consultant services to conduct a&#13;
5 It is currently envisaged that not more than 12 environmental action plans would be carried out during the&#13;
project's four-year implementation period and that, subject to the agreement of the local authorities&#13;
concerned, the cities for which such plans would be undertaken would be those explicitly cited in Law 188&#13;
/1995 and in the CONPES Document no. 2750 (December 1994), Annex 2, under Programa Mejores&#13;
Ciudades, namely: Cartagena, Buenaventura, Santa Marta, Soacha, Yumbo, Barrancabermeja, Sogamoso,&#13;
Duitama, Pasto, Pereira, and Soledad.&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
number of studies in cross-sectoral issues of relevance to urban environmental&#13;
management, including:&#13;
(i)   institutional studies (e.g., to clarify the assignment of environmental&#13;
responsibilities between cities and CARs, among cities in metropolitan&#13;
areas, etc. in areas such as strategy definition, licensing, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation, enforcement, etc);&#13;
(ii)   economic studies (e.g., to prepare a manual on financial sources and&#13;
the use of economic instruments for financing urban environmental&#13;
management by the public sector, as indicated in Annex 3.3); and&#13;
(iii)    other studies as necessary to facilitate implementation of Programa&#13;
Mejores Ciudades and the development of environmentally sustainable&#13;
management patterns for key activities or areas involving critical rural-&#13;
urban interactions (including a study of the Canal del Dique, which&#13;
operates under the jurisdiction of Corporacion Aut6noma Regional&#13;
del Canal del Dique - CARDIQUE).&#13;
(d)   Training. The project will finance appropriate training (including the&#13;
necessary equipment, materials and consultants to design, manage and carry&#13;
out training programs) for MinAmbiente's staff and for public officials and&#13;
community leaders involved in environmental management at the national,&#13;
regional, and local levels, as specified in Annexes 3.4 and 3.5, totaling&#13;
approximately US$ 2.4 million, and including:&#13;
(i)   seminars and short-term courses on the urban environment and&#13;
environmental management, involving leaders from national&#13;
institutions, universities, and local public or private environmental&#13;
agencies;&#13;
(ii)   courses for training officials of the CARs and departments in providing&#13;
technical assistance to cities for environmental management;&#13;
(iii)   courses for training municipal officials in planning and administrative&#13;
management, given in conjunction with workshops on local&#13;
environmental action plans; and&#13;
(iv)    training abroad for MinAmbiente's and the EMAs' staff in&#13;
environmental management.&#13;
(e)   Information System. The project will finance consultant services: (i) to&#13;
assist in the definition of the general concept and implementation strategy for&#13;
the urban component of the National Environmental Information System&#13;
(NEIS), which will require provisions for collecting, analyzing, reporting, and&#13;
dissemination of information on the urban environment in Colombia; and (ii)&#13;
the design, development, and implementation of a management information&#13;
system to assist MinAmbiente, and in particular DAHP, in the overall&#13;
planning, management, monitoring, and evaluation of its urban programs. In&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
addition, the project will finance training for MinAmbiente's information&#13;
management staff, and computers and other equipment required to&#13;
operationalize these systems within MinAmbiente. The total cost of this sub-&#13;
component is estimated at US$ 1.6 million, with 35 percent of this to be spent&#13;
on approximately 75 person-months of consulting services; US$ 800,000 on&#13;
equipment; and the remainder on training. Preliminary requirements have&#13;
been submitted to the Bank and will be reviewed during the appraisal.&#13;
(Implementation of this sub-component is being coordinated with the IDB,&#13;
which is financing the overall design of the NEIS, scheduled to begin in the&#13;
latter part of 1995.)&#13;
(f)    Equipment and materials. The project will finance necessary office&#13;
equipment and materials to support the effective operation of DAHP, totaling&#13;
approximately US$ 140,000.&#13;
(g)   Organizational Support/Project Administration. The project will finance&#13;
local consultant services, totaling 110 person-months or approximately US$&#13;
550,000, to assist in tasks of short to medium-term duration, complementing&#13;
regular staff and strengthening the effectiveness of DAHP and other&#13;
MinAmbiente units involved in implementation of project activities. An&#13;
allowance is also made to cover incremental project administration costs&#13;
which will be incurred by MinAmbiente, totalling approximately US$ 350,000.&#13;
71.   Given the recent creation of DAHIP, and the need to carefully define priorities to&#13;
guide MinAmbiente's technical assistance strategy for improvement of environmental&#13;
management in the country's urban areas, the project would adopt a staged approach,&#13;
compatible with the process of gradual consolidation which the SINA will be undergoing&#13;
over the four-year project implementation period. During the first year, the project would (a)&#13;
finance preparation of DAHP's strategy and action plan for the provision of technical&#13;
assistance to regional, state and municipal entities, including detailed proposals for the studies&#13;
and training programs for subsequent years of project implementation; it would also (b)&#13;
provide funds with which DAHP (in collaboration with other departments in MinAmbiente,&#13;
as needed) may address (i) issues in which support to local environmental agencies is&#13;
immediately called for (e.g., the design of regulations and procedures for the application of&#13;
economic instruments as an urban environmental management tool; the development of&#13;
appropriate enforcement mechanisms); and (ii) other technical assistance needs of broad&#13;
interest to the country's urban areas (e.g., sectoral studies in solid waste management; the&#13;
design of the urban component of the NEIS in collaboration with IDEAM and local entities;&#13;
and training). During the second and third years of project implementation, emphasis would&#13;
be placed on preparation of urban environmental strategies and action plans for cities of&#13;
under one million inhabitants, with a view to providing inputs to the formulation of campaign&#13;
programs and urban development plans of the administrations which would be initiating in&#13;
1998, during the third year of project implementation. At the time of the first year review,&#13;
special attention would be given to an assessment of the institutional and organizational&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
arrangements provided for DAHP under the project, so as to adjust such arrangements as&#13;
needed to enable MinAmbiente to carry out its mandate in the following years. After the first&#13;
year, the project would also implement other technical assistance activities proposed by the&#13;
strategy and action plan formulated during the first year. Activities financed under the project&#13;
would be carried out in accordance with an Annual Work Plan (AWP) prepared by DAHP&#13;
and agreed with the Bank. During the last year of project implementation, among other&#13;
activities, DAHP's technical assistance strategy and action plan would be redefined, and an&#13;
evaluation and revision, as needed, of its institutional model would be carried out, drawing on&#13;
the lessons derived from the previous period. Draft terms of reference for all proposed&#13;
activities are in the project files.&#13;
72.   Table I in Annex 2 provides the estimated costs of the activities to be financed under&#13;
this component, organized by expenditure category (i.e., consultants, training, and equipment&#13;
and materials) and source of financing (i.e., Bank, counterpart, other). Generic terms of&#13;
reference for key project activities are given in Annex 3. Detailed terms of reference for&#13;
activities to be carried out under this component in the first year are available in the project&#13;
files. Annex 4 presents the expected duration of activities to be carried out under this&#13;
component (Table 4.1), a timeframe to monitor preparation of Annual Work Plans, Progress&#13;
and Audit Reports (Table 4.3) and indicators to assess project outcomes (Table 4.4).&#13;
2.    Component 2: Institutional Strengthening of the Environmental&#13;
Management Agencies (EMAs) of the Four Main Urban Centers&#13;
73.   This component aims to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity of the&#13;
urban environmental management agencies (EMAs) of Bogota, Cali, Medellin and&#13;
Barranquilla to carry out the environmental management functions specified in Title VI of&#13;
Ley 99, namely, implementation of national policies, plans and programs; issuing of&#13;
environmental licenses; setting local environmental standards for emissions and ambient&#13;
quality; monitoring and enforcing environmental requirements; and collecting environmental&#13;
charges and fees. Particular emphasis will be given to assisting these EMAs to take over&#13;
functions previously assigned to other institutions, without loss of continuity, to assist them&#13;
to integrate environmental issues in the overall urban planning context, and to achieve&#13;
effective coordination with neighboring municipalities where this is required for appropriate&#13;
environmental management.&#13;
74.   The activities to be financed under this component are:&#13;
(a)   Design of the EMAs. The project would finance local and international&#13;
consultant services, totaling approximately 230 person-months or US$ 1.5&#13;
million, to assist in the detailed design of the EMAs' organizational structure&#13;
and administrative procedures. This would include the establishment of&#13;
institutional mechanisms to facilitate intra- and interjurisdictional and&#13;
intersectoral coordination, where appropriate, and citizen participation, both&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in strategic priority setting exercises, and in the design, implementation and&#13;
evaluation of environmental projects and programs.&#13;
(b)   Preparation of Urban Environmental Strategies and Action Plans. The&#13;
project would finance local and international consultant services, totaling&#13;
approximately 510 person-months or US$ 3.0 million, to revise or prepare, for&#13;
each city, an environmental strategy, based on a rapid but thorough&#13;
assessment of environmental issues, institutional capacities and constraints, in&#13;
the short and medium term. These exercises, which are to involve&#13;
consultation with key stakeholders, would take place during the first year of&#13;
project implementation and will define the specific priority activities to be&#13;
undertaken by the EMA (or other local agents under the EMA's coordination)&#13;
during subsequent years of project implementation. Detailed, city-specific&#13;
terms of reference for first year activities, in keeping with the generic terms of&#13;
reference presented in Annex 3.1 for plans to be developed under Component&#13;
1, are available in project files and will be confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
(c)    Preparation of Pre-Feasibility, Feasibility and Other Studies. The&#13;
project would finance local and international consultant services, totaling&#13;
approximately 1080 person-months or US$ 6.9 million, to prepare pre-&#13;
feasibility, feasibility and other studies for potential environmental investments&#13;
identified as a priority in the city's strategy and action plan, as well as: (i) a&#13;
small number of such studies during the first year of project implementation&#13;
and (ii) studies to meet unforeseen circumstances arising after conclusion of&#13;
the urban environmental action plan. In all cases, pre-conditions to the&#13;
financing of such studies are that they have been clearly identified as a priority,&#13;
satisfactory detailed terms of reference are available, the EMA has in place the&#13;
required staffing to coordinate the hiring and supervision of consultants, and&#13;
sufficient counterpart funds are available in local budgets. Guidelines for the&#13;
preparation of these studies are available in Annex 3.2 and will be confirmed&#13;
during negotiations.&#13;
(d)   Preparation of the Environmental Regulatory Framework and Licensing&#13;
and Enforcement Procedures. The project would finance local and&#13;
international consultant services, totaling approximately 450 person-months or&#13;
US$ 2.9 million, to adapt and complement national regulations, as needed, to&#13;
the environmental objectives and institutional conditions of each urban area.&#13;
These would include, among others, licensing procedures, emission and&#13;
ambient quality standards, guidelines for the application of user charges and&#13;
pollution fees, and the definition of mechanisms for citizen participation.&#13;
Terms of reference for first year activities are available in project files and will&#13;
be confirmed during negotiations. A summary of the general program to be&#13;
carried out with respect to economic instruments during the first two years of&#13;
project implementation is given in Annex 3.3.&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(e)   Training. The project would finance the design and carrying out of training&#13;
programs, as specified in Annex 3.4, totaling US$ 2.9 million, for&#13;
professional staff within the EMA, staff from the utilities and other units&#13;
within the municipal government and related CARs, community leaders, and&#13;
the general public. Project funds would also cover the costs of training&#13;
equipment and materials (such as publications, training kits, and other&#13;
instructional tools), and of consultants to design, manage and carry out&#13;
training programs. Modes of training would include:&#13;
(i)   seminars and short-term courses on specific environmental&#13;
management issues (e.g., environmental assessment methodology,&#13;
approaches to pollution control, environmental economics, and&#13;
participatory planning techniques);&#13;
(ii)   internship program at the EMA;&#13;
(iii)   visiting professors to local universities or the EMAs; and&#13;
(iv)    in-country university degree programs.&#13;
(f)    Environmental Education and Public Participation. The project will&#13;
finance the design and implementation of environmental education campaigns&#13;
(except for Bogota6) to raise public awareness and promote public&#13;
involvement in urban environmental management, targeting the general public&#13;
by means of the mass media, formal education programs, and other&#13;
educational and cultural activities, as specified in Annex 3.6, totalling US$ 1.7&#13;
million. Project funds would also cover the costs of communications&#13;
equipment and training equipment and materials (such as videos, printed&#13;
matter, exhibits, demonstration kits, and other instructional tools.&#13;
(g)   Information and Monitoring Systems. The project will finance local and&#13;
international consultant services: (i) to assist in the definition of the general&#13;
concept and implementation strategy for the Urban Environmental&#13;
Information System (UTEIS) of each city, which will require provisions for&#13;
collecting, analyzing, reporting, and dissemination of information on the urban&#13;
environment in Colombia; and (ii) the design, development, and&#13;
implementation of a management information system for the EMAs, to assist&#13;
them in the overall planning, management, monitoring, and evaluation of their&#13;
programs. In addition, the project will finance training for local information&#13;
management staff, and computers and other equipment required to&#13;
operationalize these systems, at the EMA or at other local agencies (such as&#13;
water and sanitation authorities). The total cost of this sub-component is&#13;
estimated at US$ 10.3 million, with 44 percent of this to be spent on&#13;
approximately 600 person-months of consulting services; US$ 4.25 on&#13;
equipment; and the remainder on training. Generic terms of reference are&#13;
6 Bogota's Environmental Education Program is being funded through other sources.&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
given in Annex 3.7. Detailed, city-specific terms of reference are available in&#13;
project files.&#13;
(h)   Equipment and materials. The project would finance the acquisition and&#13;
installation of necessary office equipment, totaling approximately US$&#13;
300,000.&#13;
(i)    Organizational Support. The project would finance local consultant&#13;
services, totaling approximately 40 person-months or US$ 200,000, to assist&#13;
Barranquilla's EMA in tasks of short to medium-term duration,&#13;
complementing regular staff, especially during the initial stages of their&#13;
operation. It will also finance incremental project administration costs for&#13;
each EMA, totalling US$ 1.1 million.&#13;
75.   As in the case of Component 1, the project would adopt a staged approach to&#13;
gradually consolidate the recently created EMAs over the four-year implementation period.&#13;
During the first year of project implementation, the project would finance participatory&#13;
preparation (or review) of institutional strategies and environmental action plans, including&#13;
detailed design of a study and training program, based on the assessment of short and&#13;
medium-term needs of the EMAs. It would also provide support to the EMAs for already&#13;
well-defined, priority, technical assistance needs to improve environmental management in&#13;
each city. In subsequent years, the project would implement the technical assistance&#13;
programs defined through the planning exercises carried out in the first year. As indicated,&#13;
these programs would allow the strengthening of the regulatory framework and the gradual&#13;
development of the agencies' capacity to: (i) carry out environmental assessment and&#13;
licensing activities; (ii) enforce regulations and environmental management plans agreed with&#13;
third parties; and (iii) monitor waste discharges, emissions, and air, water and soil conditions&#13;
(and others as needed relating to the state of the environment and the management of key&#13;
problems). The project would also finance pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for priority&#13;
environmental projects, creating a pipeline of investment projects which could be financed by&#13;
the Bank or other development agencies through future operations. At the time of the first&#13;
year review, special attention would be given to an assessment of the institutional and&#13;
organizational arrangements provided for the EMAs under the project, so as to adjust such&#13;
arrangements as needed, enabling them to better respond to their mandate in the following&#13;
years. After the first year, the technical assistance program would be reviewed and agreed&#13;
between the Bank and participating agencies on a yearly basis through preparation of an&#13;
Annual Work Plan (AWP). During the last year, among other activities, the environmental&#13;
strategy and action plan would be redefined, and an evaluation and revision, as needed, of the&#13;
agencies' institutional model would be carried out, drawing on lessons derived from the&#13;
previous period.&#13;
76.   The technical assistance proposals for each city were based on: Environmental Action&#13;
Plans prepared during the previous administrations in the case of Bogota and Barranquilla;&#13;
reports and consultations carried out during the second semester of 1994 as an input to the&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
creation of Cali's DAGMA; institutional strengthening proposals prepared by each city and&#13;
reviewed by the Bank team and MinAmbiente. They also reflect the urban development plans&#13;
of the four administrations for the 1995-98 period, of which environmental investments and&#13;
programs are in all cases included. Specific cost information on the technical assistance&#13;
program for each city, including the financing plan, is shown in Tables 2 through 5 in Annex&#13;
2. Generic terms of reference for key project activities are given in Annex 3. Detailed terms&#13;
of reference for activities to be undertaken in the first year of the project are available in&#13;
project files. Annex 4 presents the expected duration of activities to be carried out under this&#13;
component (Table 4.2), a timeframe to monitor preparation of Annual Work Plans, Progress&#13;
and Audit Reports (Table 4.3) and indicators to assess project outcomes (Table 4.4).&#13;
C.    Project Costs and Financing&#13;
77.   The total cost of the project (excluding taxes and including contingencies) is&#13;
estimated tentatively at US$ 40 million, approximately 48 percent of which is estimated to be&#13;
in foreign exchange. The Government is seeking an IBRD loan of US$ 20 million, the&#13;
proceeds of which will be made available to implementing agencies on a grant basis. The&#13;
remaining counterpart funds (US$ 20 million) will be provided by the Government of&#13;
Colombia and by the district, municipal and metropolitan governments of Bogota, Cali,&#13;
Medellin and Barranquilla. Retroactive financing in the amount of US$ 2 million is available&#13;
for justifiable project activities eligible after July 31, 1995. Further details of project cost and&#13;
financing are shown in Annex 2.&#13;
IV. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION&#13;
A.   Project Implementation/Coordination Arrangements&#13;
78.   MinAmbiente will be responsible for directing project implementation and ensuring&#13;
coordination among the various institutions. Moreover, MinAmbiente will implement its own&#13;
institutional strengthening component, will provide technical assistance and training for urban&#13;
areas not included in Component 2, and will coordinate closely with IDEAM to develop the&#13;
urban environmental information systems. In the case of the four urban centers, the actual&#13;
implementing agencies will be the Environmental Management Agencies (EMAs) of Bogota,&#13;
Cali, Medellin, and Barranquilla.&#13;
79.   Within this overall institutional framework, the following coordinating mechanisms&#13;
will be established specifically for implementation of the project:&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a)   A Project Steering Committee (PSC), consisting of the Minister of&#13;
MinAmbiente, the Director of DAHP, the Chief of the Environmental Policy&#13;
Unit of DNP, and the directors of the EMAs of the four urban centers, will be&#13;
formed to oversee general implementation of the project and, in particular, to:&#13;
(i) approve the Annual Work Plan (AWP) and operating budget for these&#13;
components; (ii) review progress in implementation of the AWP,&#13;
recommending or approving adjustments as needed; and (iii) monitor and&#13;
evaluate achievement of project objectives.&#13;
(b)   MinAmbiente will, through DAHP: (i) coordinate the technical&#13;
implementation of all components of the project; (ii) work with the&#13;
counterparts in the urban centers, IDEAM and DNP, as needed; (iii) support&#13;
the functioning of the PSC; (iv) monitor project progress; (v) coordinate the&#13;
preparation of annual reports; and, through the General Secretariat: (vi)&#13;
screen the acquisition of goods and services; (vii) coordinate the presentation&#13;
of disbursement requests to the Bank; and (viii) oversee the timely contracting&#13;
of project audits and annual reports.&#13;
(c)   In each city, the environmental agencies will: (i) manage the local technical&#13;
assistance program under the project; (ii) contract and supervise the execution&#13;
of studies, consultancies, and training programs; (iii) acquire goods,&#13;
equipment and other project-related materials; (iv) prepare audits and annual&#13;
reports for the project; and (v) coordinate with DAHP, as needed, to ensure&#13;
satisfactory and timely project implementation.&#13;
(d)   To provide support for development of the urban environmental information&#13;
systems, a Technical Work Group (TWG) will be established under the&#13;
leadership of MinAmbiente and IDEAM, with representation from the four&#13;
urban centers. The TWG will be responsible for reviewing annual work plans&#13;
for strengthening environmental monitoring capacity in the four cities and all&#13;
other proposals relating to the establishment or improvement of urban&#13;
environmental information systems, prior to the submission of such plans to&#13;
the PSC. Within IDEAM, one person will be dedicated to implementation of&#13;
the project component and will coordinate with the TWG and the counterparts&#13;
in the urban centers.&#13;
80.   An organizational chart displaying the coordinating mechanisms established for&#13;
implementation of the project is shown in Figure 3.&#13;
81.   To clarify project implementation arrangements, MinAmbiente will enter into&#13;
agreements (convenios) with the EMAs of the four urban centers setting forth the technical,&#13;
financial and all other responsibilities relating to implementation of the project. The&#13;
convenios, of which a draft has been submitted to the Bank, include, among others,&#13;
requirements with respect to: (a) core staffing of DAHP and the EMAs, in numbers and&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
qualification satisfactory to the Bank, to be appointed and in place in accordance with an&#13;
agreed timetable; (b) the preparation of Annual Work Plans (AWP) to be agreed with the&#13;
Bank, and in accordance with the timeframe indicated in Table 4.3 of Annex 4; (c) allocation&#13;
of counterpart funding in annual budgets; and (d) project administration arrangements&#13;
(covering procurement, disbursement, accounting and auditing, monitoring and evaluation),&#13;
incorporating the specifications in paragraphs 82 through 91 of this Technical Annex.&#13;
Agreement between MinAmbiente and the EMAs on the terms of the convenios are a&#13;
condition of negotiations. Appropriate staffing of DAHP is a condition of effectiveness. In&#13;
addition, as a condition of effectiveness, for any two EMAs: (i) key staff would be appointed&#13;
and in place; (ii) the convenios referred to above would have been signed; and (iii) they&#13;
would have either entered into separate agreements with an entity such as UNDP or,&#13;
alternatively, opened a project account to be funded inititally with their own resources, in&#13;
order to expedite disbursements and enable the mix of funds from the Ministry (to be&#13;
reimbursed from the loan) and the EMAs. A draft Project Implementation Manual is&#13;
available and will be issued by MinAmbiente in final form, incorporating the results of&#13;
negotiations, before project effectiveness.&#13;

B.    Procurement&#13;
82.   Project components (goods and consulting services) financed under the proposed&#13;
Bank loan would be procured in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
(January 1995) and Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). Although&#13;
not foreseen, in cases where goods are to be procured by International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB), project agencies would use standard bidding documents issued by the Bank and the&#13;
Bank's standard form of contract for consultant services for complex, time-based&#13;
assignments. In the case of procurement of goods by National Competitive Bidding (NCB)',&#13;
' Although some conflicts have been identified between Colombian Law No. 80 and the Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement and the Bank's Procurement Policies, the Government has decided to abide by the Bank&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
bidding documents that have been agreed in advance with the Bank would be used. All&#13;
procurement aspects will be confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
83.    A breakdown of goods and services for the project to be procured by ICB, NCB and&#13;
other methods is presented in Table 1. No civil works would be undertaken under the&#13;
project. Acquisition of goods and equipment would comprise vehicles, laboratory equipment,&#13;
computers, and office equipment. Although not foreseen, ICB would be used for goods&#13;
contracts above US$ 250,000. Under ICB for goods, local manufacturers would be granted&#13;
a margin of preference in accordance with Bank guidelines. For contracts between US$&#13;
100,000 and US $250,000, Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures would be used&#13;
for the purchase of computers and some laboratory equipment, up to an aggregate of US$&#13;
1.85 million, while NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank would be used for the purchase&#13;
of other goods, up to an aggregate of US$ 1.84 million. National shopping on the basis of&#13;
price quotations from at least three eligible suppliers would be used for goods contracts with&#13;
estimated costs less than US$ 100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 4.0 million for&#13;
total acquisitions under the project and up to 10 % of the estimated aggregate of each&#13;
agency's project budget over the implementation period. Each implementing agency would&#13;
be responsible for non-eligible expenditures, including taxes, in respect of the goods and&#13;
services it acquires.&#13;

84.    The Bank's prior review of procurement documentation is estimated to involve about&#13;
80% of the total value of Bank-financed contracts for goods and services and would cover all&#13;
major procurement steps (terms of reference, advertising, short lists, letters of invitation,&#13;
bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, award recommendations, and contract&#13;
documents). Procurement documentation and contracts not covered under prior review&#13;
would be subject to ex-post review during supervision missions, comprising around 10% of&#13;
unreviewed procured cases. The thresholds for prior review are contained in Table 2.&#13;

85.    Training services (including planning, carrying out, and evaluating the results of&#13;
training programs), which are expected to aggregate to about US$7.68 million, would be&#13;
provided by firms and by specialized training institutions and professionals. Contracts for&#13;
training services will be subject to the Bank's prior review as specified in the previous&#13;
paragraph.&#13;
86.    DAHP and the EMAs of the four urban centers would be responsible for the&#13;
procurement of all goods and services under the project. Recording of procurement&#13;
information would comprise: (a) the prompt reporting of contract awards to the Bank; and&#13;
(b) the presentation of comprehensive biannual reports to the Bank, including: (i) revised cost&#13;
estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates for price&#13;
contingencies; (ii) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding,&#13;
contract award, and completion time for individual contracts; and (iii) indication of&#13;
compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement. In addition, (c) an&#13;
34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be prepared by the borrower and presented&#13;
to the Bank within six months of the loan's closing date. The capacity of DAHP and of the&#13;
EMAs to carry out (or contract and supervise consultants to carry out) procurement and&#13;
other project administration tasks was verified during appraisal. To strengthen such capacity,&#13;
it was agreed that: (a) MinAmbiente would hire or appoint, train and make one person&#13;
responsible for the overview of all procurement processes, for advising all implementing&#13;
agencies on procurement matters, and for the discussion of such matters with the Bank; (b)&#13;
the Project Implementation Manual would include the procurement plan, bidding packages,&#13;
standardized bidding documents for goods and standardized procurement documents for&#13;
consultancies (including TORs, sample invitation letters, sample contracts, bid evaluation and&#13;
other standard forms), bidding procedures, and distribution of responsibilities among&#13;
implementing agencies; and (c) a three-day seminar on such tasks would be provided at the&#13;
onset of (or preferably prior to) project implementation, for MinAmbiente and the EMAs'&#13;
staff, under MinAmbiente's training program, with Bank assistance.&#13;
C.    Disbursement&#13;
87.   The proposed Bank loan of US$ 20.0 million will be disbursed over a period of four&#13;
years. The standard disbursement profile for Technical Assistance projects in Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean, dated August 1993 (a six and one-half year profile) was not used since&#13;
this project has been designed to provide short- to medium-term support to the Government&#13;
of Colombia to build its new environmental institutional framework (SINA). The&#13;
Government is confident that the project will fully disburse within the shorter time frame.&#13;
88.   The Bank will reimburse the Government for eligible expenditures incurred by&#13;
MinAmbiente and the EMAs of the four urban centers at a rate of 50 percent for all foreign&#13;
and local expenditures. To facilitate project implementation, MinAmbiente will establish,&#13;
maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, a Special Account&#13;
(SA) with the Central Bank of Colombia. The authorized allocation will be US$ 1.5 million,&#13;
representing about four-months of average Bank-financed projected expenditures. An initial&#13;
deposit of up to an amount equivalent to US 1 million may be requested after the loan&#13;
becomes effective. The full amount of the authorized allocation may be requested when&#13;
withdrawals and commitments from the loan account are equal to or exceed the equivalent of&#13;
US$ 6 million. The SA will be replenished at monthly intervals or whenever the account&#13;
balance drops to 70% of the initial deposit, whichever comes first. Monthly bank statements&#13;
of the SA, reconciled by the Borrower, will accompany all replenishment requests. Statement&#13;
of Expenses (SoEs) will be used for expenditures which do not require prior review of the&#13;
corresponding contracts (i.e., for the acquisition of goods below US$ 100,000 and for&#13;
consultant services below US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000 for individuals, except&#13;
when they involve assignments of a critical nature as defined by the Bank or amendments&#13;
which raise the total cost of contract to more than US$ 100,000 for firms or US$ 50,000 for&#13;
individuals). The supporting documentation, in such cases, will be retained by MinAmbiente&#13;
and the EMAs for inspection during supervision missions and for auditing. All other&#13;
35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
disbursements will be made against full documentation, as specified in Bank guidelines and in&#13;
the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
89.   Retroactive financing of up to US$ 2 million will be provided for eligible project&#13;
expenditures (made after July 31, 1995, but not to exceed more than one year from the date&#13;
of signing.). The project is expected to be completed by January 31, 2000, and to close by&#13;
July 31, 2000. Tables 3 and 4 below give details of the allocation of loan proceeds and the&#13;
estimated loan disbursement schedule.&#13;

D.   Accounting and Auditing&#13;
90.   MinAmbiente and the EMAs of the four urban centers will establish separate accounts&#13;
to record eligible project expenditures made and to allow for adequate monitoring of financial&#13;
operations under the project. The project accounts, SA, and related financial information&#13;
(including supporting documentation) will be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank in accordance with Bank auditing guidelines. Certified copies of the&#13;
audited consolidated project accounts and audited SA will be submitted to the Bank not later&#13;
than six months after the close of the financial year, starting with the audit reports for the&#13;
financial year ending December 31, 1996.&#13;
E.    Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
91.   MinAmbiente will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the project. A&#13;
Project Implementation Manual is being prepared by MinAmbiente, specifying the procedures&#13;
governing monitoring and evaluation of the project. A draft has been submitted to the Bank&#13;
and will be finalized prior to effectiveness. Specific annual outcomes and indicators to&#13;
monitor progress in project implementation and to assess project outcomes are defined in&#13;
Annex 4 (Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4). From the information provided by the EMAs of the four&#13;
urban centers, DAHP will prepare semi-annual progress reports and all additional&#13;
documentation required for supervision of the project. An Implementation Completion&#13;
Report will be submitted by MinAmbiente no later than six months after completion of the&#13;
project, i.e., by July 31, 2000. All reports will follow the format included in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual. A timeframe for their preparation is available in Annex 4 (Table&#13;
4.3).&#13;
V.   PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
92.   The project would complement ongoing efforts to establish a comprehensive,&#13;
permanent framework to effectively address environmental issues in Colombia. It will provide&#13;
support to MinAmbiente and the EMAs of the country's four largest cities in their initial&#13;
37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
stages of operation, assisting them to define appropriate organizational structures and&#13;
mechanisms of collaboration with other public agencies, neighboring jurisdictions, local&#13;
communities and the private sector, to address their new or expanded mandates. The project&#13;
will also carry out planning exercises to identify environmental priorities and generate the&#13;
studies and technical analyses that can lead to future least-cost investments and other&#13;
measures to improve basic environmental conditions in urban areas in Colombia. It will also&#13;
develop or strengthen the regulatory framework (comprising licensing procedures, and&#13;
pollution standards, among others) and the environmental monitoring and evaluation capacity&#13;
in the country's major urban areas, thus providing the pre-conditions for (a) appropriate&#13;
enforcement of environmental standards and of compliance with environmental protection or&#13;
impact mitigation plans; and (b) improved assessment of environmental problems and&#13;
definition of environmental strategies and action plans in the future.&#13;
93.   The project's risks lie in project coordination and implementation by a relatively&#13;
inexperienced ministry and in implementation by new environmental agencies in very&#13;
independent urban administrations which will be subject to changes upon the election of new&#13;
mayors midway through project implementation. The key to minimizing these risks will be to&#13;
establish at the outset a solid core team in MinAmbiente's DAHP to undertake project&#13;
coordination, as well as counterpart teams in each city, with technical and financial&#13;
responsibilities clearly laid out in convenios between MinAmbiente and the EMAs.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A.   AGREEEMENTS&#13;
94.   The following conditions of negotiations were fullfilled:&#13;
(a)   Evidence was given to the Bank of a firm commitment to the project from the&#13;
key implementing agencies (MinAmbiente and the EMAs of the four major&#13;
cities), namely through:&#13;
(i)   approval of the proposed project concept (and corresponding&#13;
authorization to contract the loan and guarantee of budgetary&#13;
allocation of counterpart funds) by the Consejo Nacional de Politica&#13;
Econ6mica y Social (CONPES) and, on a preliminary basis (first&#13;
presentation), by the Comisi6n Interparlamentaria de Cr&amp;dito&#13;
Pibhlico,&#13;
(ii)   preliminary agreement on a draft model of the convenio to be signed&#13;
between each of the four cities (Bogota, Cali, Medellin/Valle de&#13;
Aburra, and Barranquilla) and MinAmbiente, setting forth technical&#13;
38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and financial obligations of each agency in implementation of the&#13;
project; and&#13;
(iii)    evidence that funds have been allocated by each of the four urban&#13;
administrations and by MinAmbiente to the activities to be carried out&#13;
under the project (at least) during the first year.&#13;
(e)    A revised Project Implementation Manual, agreed between MinAmbiente and&#13;
the four EMAs, was presented to the Bank.&#13;
95.   During negotiations, final agreements were reached on the scope and timetable of the&#13;
technical assistance program of each implementing agency and on project implementation&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
96.   The following would be conditions of effectiveness:&#13;
(a)    The Project Implementation Manual would be issued by the MoE,&#13;
incorporating the results of negotiations and in form and substance&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 8 1).&#13;
(b)   DA]HP would have key staff in place (paragraph 8 1).&#13;
(c)    For any two cities considered under Component 2 of the project:&#13;
(i)   there would be key staff appointed and in place (paragraph 8 1);&#13;
(ii)    a convenio would have been signed with MinAmbiente stating their&#13;
financial and technical responsibilities in implementation of the project&#13;
(paragraph 81); and&#13;
(iii)   the agency either would have entered into a separate agreement with&#13;
an entity such as UNDP or, alternatively, would have opened a project&#13;
account to be funded inititally with their own resources, in order to&#13;
expedite disbursements and enable the mix of funds from the Mfinistry&#13;
(to be reimbursed from the loan) and the EMAs (paragraph) 8 1).&#13;
97.   As conditions of disbursement, the environmental agencies of the other two cities,&#13;
not taken into account for purposes of paragraph 96 (c) above, would have to satisfy the&#13;
same conditions stated therein as conditions of effectiveness (paragraph 8 1).&#13;
39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.    Recommendation&#13;
98.   With the above agreements and assurances, the project would constitute a suitable&#13;
basis for a loan for US$ 20 million equivalent at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,&#13;
with a maturity of 17 years, including five years of grace.&#13;

ANNEXES&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Experience&#13;
Although the Bank has not had previous experience in environmental institution building in&#13;
Colombia, it has had such experience in a number of other countries in the LAC region (e.g.,&#13;
Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Bolivia, El Salvador, and Honduras) and this project should benefit&#13;
from this experience. Among the lessons learned in similar work in these countries are the&#13;
following:&#13;
a) Clearly define project objectives. During preparation of the UEMP project, every effort&#13;
was made to define project objectives clearly and to limit those objectives to what is&#13;
feasible within the context of a technical assistance project. Unnecessarily diffuse&#13;
objectives were avoided.&#13;
b) Agree on priority environmental issues. In the first year, the project will focus&#13;
MinAmbiente and the urban centers on identifying and addressing priority environmental&#13;
issues through the preparation of action plans. These action plans will identify the&#13;
priorities to be addressed in subsequent years, including the preparation of feasibility&#13;
studies and other activities necessary for subsequent investment.&#13;
c) Avoid institutional political disputes. Care has been taken in designing the institution-&#13;
building components of the project to promote inter-institutional collaboration and&#13;
coordination, both between national and local environmental agencies and among local&#13;
agencies within urban metropolitan areas, and to avoid any institutional political conflicts&#13;
in the transfer of environmental functions from existing institutions to newly created ones.&#13;
d) Avoid inappropriate technology. The project will ensure that the technologies&#13;
recommended for the environmental information systems and for environmental&#13;
monitoring and laboratory analysis in the urban centers are appropriate to their needs and&#13;
capabilities, and take into account long-term sustainability.&#13;
e) Ensure public consultation. Consistent with the public consultation provisions of the&#13;
Colombian Constitution and Law 99 of 1993, the project will involve active public&#13;
participation in the planning, execution, and evaluation of environmental activities. For&#13;
example, preparation of the local urban environmental action plans will include public&#13;
consultation.&#13;
f) Train local project administrators in Bank procedures. Before the project becomes&#13;
effective, local project administrators in both MinAmbiente and the urban centers will be&#13;
fully trained in Bank procedures in order to facilitate procurement, document processing,&#13;
disbursement, etc.&#13;
Many of these lessons reflect the conclusions and recommendations drawn from a Bank&#13;
review of the urban environmental issues addressed in National Environmental Action Plans&#13;
42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(see Urban Environmental Problems in National Environmental Strategies and Action&#13;
Plans, September 1994).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;
Terms of Reference for Urban Environmental Strategies and Action Plans&#13;
Background: Urban Environmental Action Plans (UEAPs) help to define environmental&#13;
goals for the short, medium and long-term, as well as priority urban investments. In&#13;
addition, they help to identify concrete actions relating to institutional strengthening and&#13;
legal, regulatory and institutional reform which are necessary for effective and efficient&#13;
urban environmental management. UEAPs are developed on the basis of forums,&#13;
seminars, meetings and other forms of interaction between interested parties from the&#13;
public and private sectors.&#13;
Objective: The UEAPs to be financed under the Project would serve to orient urban&#13;
management, identifying critical environmental problems and defining a staged strategy to&#13;
address these. They would also propose priority environmental projects and programs,&#13;
assigning specific responsibilities to public entities, and defining appropriate timeframes&#13;
and budgets for their implementation. They would also help to orient the environmental&#13;
activities and responsibilities of the private sector.&#13;
Tasks: In accordance with the extensive international experience accumulated in&#13;
preparation of UEAPs, the process to be followed during the preparation of such plans&#13;
under the Urban Environmental Management Project would consist of the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
1.    Identification or establishment of appropriate coordination and participatory&#13;
consultative mechanisms, comprising:&#13;
(a)   a high-level Advisory Committee, responsible for (i) overall supervision of&#13;
preparation of the UEAP, (ii) obtaining its approval by the appropriate&#13;
authorities, (iii) guaranteeing the allocation of necessary resources to carry&#13;
out the UEAP, and (iv) following through its implementation;&#13;
(b)   Technical Working Groups, made up of representatives of the relevant&#13;
municipal and sectoral entities, to discuss each priority environmental&#13;
problem and to assist consultants in preparation of terms of reference for&#13;
priority pre-investment studies (and subsequently follow through their&#13;
preparation, as indicated in Annex 3.2); and&#13;
(c)   public participation mechanisms (e.g. local or regional environmental&#13;
councils, round tables, town meetings) to stimulate a wide debate on&#13;
priority environmental problems and their respective solutions and to&#13;
obtain public consensus on these.&#13;
2.    Execution of a rapid urban environmental assessment, based on secondary sources&#13;
of information in order to develop a reliable data base of the environmental situation of the&#13;
city in question, using as a tool, for example, the questionnaire developed by the Urban&#13;
51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Management Program of the World Bank. This activity would utilize appropriate public&#13;
participation mechanisms identified in Activity 1, such as interviews, round tables, and&#13;
discussion with groups affected by a given environmental problem.&#13;
3.    Preparation of an environmental profile for the city concerned, using the urban&#13;
environmental data gathered through the rapid urban environmental assessment, together&#13;
with descriptions and complementary explanations in order to obtain a better&#13;
understanding of the environmental problems detected.&#13;
4.    General discussion of the profile, in order to inform the public of the findings, and&#13;
to stimulate dialogue, through, for example, a Town Meeting. At a minimum, the&#13;
following would be consulted: (a) those affected by the priority environmental problems&#13;
or by the actions required to resolve these problems; (b) those who would take the&#13;
decision or manage the necessary resources and instruments in order to resolve the priority&#13;
problems; and (c) those that possess the knowledge and information to resolve the&#13;
problems.&#13;
5.    Preparation of preliminary UEAP proposals, specifying medium and long-term&#13;
goals in environmental management for the urban area and formulating a staged,&#13;
comprehensive strategy to address current and emerging issues, based on the conclusions&#13;
of the profile and the agreements obtained through the consultative process. The&#13;
preliminary UEAP should also include summary terms of reference (TORs) for the&#13;
projects and programs to be undertaken in the course of the next three years. Possible&#13;
priority projects and programs would comprise: pollution abatement/control or natural&#13;
resource management investment projects; legal and regulatory reforms; institutional&#13;
reform; training and environmental education; monitoring and evaluation of er.mironmental&#13;
conditions.&#13;
6.    General discussion of the UEAP proposals with the public.&#13;
7.    Adjustment and detailed formulation of the plan, incorporating recommendations&#13;
from the discussion of the preliminary draft and developing the TORs for all proposed&#13;
activities, specifying the institutional arrangements, coordination mechanisms, financial&#13;
requirements, sources of funding, timetables, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements&#13;
needed to carry out such projects and programs.&#13;
8.    Submission of the plan to the approval of the appropriate local authorities. The&#13;
UEAP would also be submitted to the Bank for consideration of the priority projects and&#13;
programs which would be financed in subsequent years by the Project.&#13;
Timeframe: 6-12 months&#13;
52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Budget: The budget for this activity varies for each of the EMAs, due to the different&#13;
state of readiness and existing framework in each of the cities. Further details of the&#13;
budget for this activity can be found in Annex 2.&#13;
53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Guidelines for Pre-Feasibility Studies&#13;
Background: The Project would finance the preparation of up to three pre-feasibility&#13;
studies to address priority problems in environmental management in each urban area&#13;
considered under Component 2. Such studies may result either from recommendations of&#13;
the UEMNP (see Annex 3.1) or from discussions held with the Bank during project&#13;
preparation. In the latter case specific terms of reference (TORs) for studies to be carried&#13;
out during the first year are available in the project files.&#13;
Objectives: Pre-feasibility studies would be carried out under the Project to (a) identify&#13;
alternative solutions and define cost-effective options to solve clearly identified priority&#13;
problems needing immediate attention to either mitigate or avoid fuirther damage to the&#13;
urban environment. In addition, the Project would also finance studies to (b) define the&#13;
medium- and long-term strategy with regard to emerging environmental problems&#13;
identified in the UEMNP process, to develop preventive measures, emphasizing legal reform&#13;
and institutional priorities, which in turn could lead to additional studies, for example, on&#13;
new institutional arrangements, or the design of economic instruments.&#13;
Tasks: The preparation of each study would comprise the following activities:&#13;
1.    Review of the TORs by the Technical Working Groups established during the&#13;
UEMP stage.&#13;
2.    The execution of studies with the support of consultants, under the general&#13;
supervision of the appropriate Technical Working Group.&#13;
3.    The review and approval of the completed studies by the appropriate groups, and&#13;
through a consultative process similar to that employed during the preparation of the&#13;
UEMP.&#13;
4.    The gathering of political support and confirmation of respective political decisions&#13;
in order to guarantee the recommended course of action identified to resolve the&#13;
environmental problem.&#13;
Timeframe: Although this may vary considerably from study to study, it is expected that&#13;
each study would take from 9 to 12 months on average.&#13;
Budget: Budgets will vary for each study. Further details for first-year studies can be&#13;
found in Annex 2 and in specific TORs in the project files.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Terms of Reference for Studies and Seminars&#13;
on Environmental Economics&#13;
Background: Ley 99 of 1993 recognizes the importance of economic instruments in the&#13;
new environmental policy of Colombia, providing sources of revenue for environmental&#13;
management at the municipal and regional levels and establishing environmental fees&#13;
(tasas retributivasy compensatorias) for the use of natural resources and contamination&#13;
of the environment. In effect, these provisions make municipal and regional environmental&#13;
management agencies (EMAs) environmental-economic planners. To support these&#13;
agencies in these new functions, the project will finance technical assistance, specifically&#13;
studies and seminars, with respect to the design and implementation of economic&#13;
instruments for environmental management.&#13;
Objective: The objective of the technical assistance is to support MinAmbiente and the&#13;
EMAs of the four urban centers in establishing and putting into use appropriate economic&#13;
instruments for urban environmental management.&#13;
Activities: The technical assistance will include the following activities, which will take&#13;
place in the first two years of the project.&#13;
1.    Activities to be carried out by NinAmbiente during the first year of project&#13;
implementation:&#13;
(a)   Study 1: Review of Existing Economic-Financial Instruments and Laws --&#13;
Inventory those instruments and laws in effect which may have to be&#13;
changed as a result of Ley 99. Determine the legal and financial bases of&#13;
national and local agencies to support environmental management.&#13;
(duration: 3 months)&#13;
(b)   Study 2: Definition of Environmental Fees -- Provide the technizal basis&#13;
for promulgation of tasas retributivasy compensatorias and the processes&#13;
for their application and annual review/revision. The study would review&#13;
international experience in evaluating and charging for social and&#13;
environmental damages. (duration: 6 months)&#13;
(c)   Study 3: Additional Economic Instruments for Urban Environmental&#13;
Management -- Review experience with a wide range of economic&#13;
instruments in other countries. On the basis of specific environmental&#13;
problems to be addressed by urban areas, it would provide a menu of&#13;
economic instrument options for local implementation. (duration: 6&#13;
months)&#13;
(d)   Study 4: Economic-Financial Manual for Urban Environmental&#13;
Management -- Prepare a manual of economic-financial instruments&#13;
available to local authorities for environmental management, explaining&#13;
55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
how to select, design and implement the different instruments, and their&#13;
likely impact on local budgets. (duration: 3 months)&#13;
(e)   Seminar 1: International Seminar on Economic Instruments and Economic&#13;
Valuation in Environmental Management. Train MinAmbiente, staff from&#13;
urban areas, and others in the basics of environmental economics.&#13;
(duration: 5 days, 50 attendees)&#13;
(f)   Seminar 2: National Seminar on Environmental Fees. Review and discuss&#13;
the study prepared for promulgation of the environmental fees. Agree on&#13;
final draft of decree for fees. (duration: 4 days; 30 attendees)&#13;
(g)   Seminar 3: National Seminar on the Economic-Financial Manual for Urban&#13;
Environmental Management. Review and comment on the proposed&#13;
economic-financial manual. Agree on final draft of manual. (duration: 4&#13;
days; 30 attendees)&#13;
2.    Activities to be carried out by each EMA starting the second year of project&#13;
implementation:&#13;
(a)   Study 1: Use of Economic Instruments in Environmental Management at&#13;
the Local Level. Design and implement economic instruments in a&#13;
particular urban center. (duration: 3 months)&#13;
(b)   Study 2: Environmental Fees for Environmental Management at the Local&#13;
Level. Review and adapt the environmental fees guidelines developed at&#13;
the national level to the situation in each urban center and prepare&#13;
guidelines for the annual update of such fees. (duration: 3 months)&#13;
(c)   Study 3: Economic-Environmental Planning Models for Urban Areas.&#13;
Integrate the use of economic instruments for environmental management&#13;
into the municipal budget process, taking into account environmental&#13;
impacts and impacts on the local budget. (duration: 6 months)&#13;
(d)   Study 4: Economic-Financial Manual for Urban Areas. Adapt the&#13;
economic-financial manual prepared by MinAmbiente for the use of each&#13;
urban center. (duration: 3 months)&#13;
(e)   Seminar 1: Use of Economic-Environmental Planning Models. Develop&#13;
budgetary planning models which take into account environmental issues,&#13;
to be used at the local level. (duration: 4 days; 30 attendees; joint event for&#13;
the four urban centers)&#13;
(f)   Seminar 2: Review of Municipal Experiences. Exchange experiences of&#13;
the urban centers during the first two years of the project. (duration: 4&#13;
days; 30 attendees; joint event for the four urban centers).&#13;
Timeframe: These activities would be concentrated in the first two years of project&#13;
implementation. After the third year, the EMAs should be capable of fully managing the&#13;
proposed economic instruments, and periodically updating fee structures, levels and&#13;
administrative systems. Additional studies and seminars in support of these objectives&#13;
would be defined during preparation of the Annual Work Plans for years 2, 3 and 4.&#13;

Annex 3.5&#13;
Terms of Reference for the Environmental Training Expert&#13;
Background: The Direcci6n de Asentamientos Humanosy Poblaci6n (DAHP) is&#13;
responsible for strengthening institutional capacity within the SINA with respect to urban&#13;
environmental management. Much of this institutional strengthening will consist of training&#13;
and educating functionaries of national, regional, and local governmental institutions with&#13;
environmental management responsibilities, representatives of appropriate non-governmental&#13;
and community-based organizations, and the public. In order to carry out these training&#13;
functions, DABP will need the assistance of a qualified expert to design an appropriate four-&#13;
year Training Program.&#13;
Objective: The objective of the consultancy is to assist DAHP in designing a four-year&#13;
Training Program for strengthening the managerial and technical capacity for urban&#13;
environmental management at the national, regional, and local levels, and to produce a&#13;
detailed implementation strategy, in close coordination with MinAmbiente's Environmental&#13;
Education Strategy and the Training and Environmental Education Programs to be carried&#13;
out by the EMAs of Colombia's four major urban centers under the Urban Environmental&#13;
Management Project.&#13;
Tasks: The training expert will perform the following tasks:&#13;
(a)   work jointly with DAHP staff to determine the priority training needs with&#13;
respect to urban environmental management in the institutions of the SINA&#13;
(i.e., the CARs, departments, cities, etc.), and in other governmental and non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs);&#13;
(b)   work jointly with DAHP to develop a four-year Training Program to address&#13;
these needs, identifying the persons to be trained (e.g., personnel in the SINA&#13;
institutions, representatives of NGOs, etc.), the types of training to be&#13;
provided (e.g., managerial, technical, etc.), the methods of training to be used&#13;
(e.g., workshops, seminars, courses, internships, study abroad, etc.), the&#13;
providers of the training (e.g., consultants, university faculty, international&#13;
experts, etc.), the number of training events to be held, and the costs&#13;
associated with the training,&#13;
(c)   review the proposed Training Program for 1996 to ensure that it is consistent&#13;
with the overall four-year plan, adjusting it as needed; and&#13;
(d)   prepare preliminary Annual Training Programs for implementing the four-year&#13;
plan, specifying, on a annual basis, the number of events, timing, numbers of&#13;
persons to be trained, providers of training services, budgets, institutional&#13;
responsibilities for planning and carrying out training programs, these&#13;
62&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
programs would be reviewed and adjusted as needed during project&#13;
implementation, through the preparation of the Annual Work Plan (AWP).&#13;
Timeframe: The training expert will be hired in the final quarter of 1995 or first quarter of&#13;
1996 and would have four to six weeks in which to complete the assigned tasks.&#13;
63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.6&#13;
Terms of Reference for Environmental Education Programs&#13;
Background: As part of the institution building under the project, the environmental&#13;
agencies in the four urban centers (i.e., DAMA, DAGMA, AREA, DADIMA) will each&#13;
undertake a public awareness and environmental education program, both to raise public&#13;
consciousness on urban environmental issues in general and to address priority urban&#13;
environmental concerns in particular. This program will be developed in close coordination&#13;
with the Ministerio de Educaci6n at the national level and with the appropriate educational&#13;
institutions at the regional and local levels, and it will complement and build on the&#13;
environmental management training program being developed by DAHP under the project.&#13;
The following are generic terms of reference for the development of four-year Public&#13;
Awareness and Environmental Education Programs under Component 2 of the Urban&#13;
Environmental Management Project. Each urban center has provided specific terms of&#13;
reference in its technical assistance proposal.&#13;
Objective: The objective is to raise public consciousness and promote public involvement in&#13;
urban environmental management through education by means of the communications media,&#13;
formal education programs, and other related activities.&#13;
Tasks: The public awareness and environmental education program would be developed in&#13;
the following steps:&#13;
(a)   Assessment of existing public awareness/environmental education efforts.&#13;
DAHP's Subdirecci6n de Educaci6n Ambiental has put in place an extensive&#13;
environmental education program for the last half of 1995, involving the mass&#13;
media, formal education programs, training, and other activities. In addition,&#13;
Bogota's DAMA already has an environmental education program, which&#13;
includes television messages, printed materials, and formal education&#13;
programs in selected primary and secondary schools. The first step under the&#13;
project will be to assess these ongoing efforts to determine exactly what is&#13;
already being done, what has proven to be effective, and where additional&#13;
efforts remain to be made.&#13;
(b)   Identification of public awareness/environmental education priorities. Based&#13;
on the preliminary assessment of existing educational efforts and the&#13;
consideration of priority urban environmental issues, the next step will be to&#13;
identify priorities for the public awareness/environmental education program&#13;
to be developed under the project, distinguishing among the various publics or&#13;
target groups. This will vary from urban center to urban center depending on&#13;
the status of existing educational efforts and the environmental priorities&#13;
identified under the Urban Environmental Action Plan exercise. Thus, each&#13;
urban center's four-year environmental educational program should be&#13;
64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
designed to address the particular environmental priorities identified in the&#13;
urban area.&#13;
(c)    Design of an appropriate public awareness/environmental education program.&#13;
The next step will be to develop an educational program, employing the range&#13;
of public awareness/educational tools available, to address the priorities&#13;
identified. The program will vary from urban center to urban center but&#13;
should include (i) the mass media (i.e., television, radio, publications, printed&#13;
materials, etc.); (ii) formal education programs (e.g., primary and secondary&#13;
school curriculum, adult education, etc.); (iii) other educational and cultural&#13;
activities (e.g., public forums, art exhibitions, festivals, etc.). The program&#13;
will comprise the participating institutions, implementation timeframe, and the&#13;
budget for the educational activities. The program should be designed with&#13;
the active participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and&#13;
community-based groups with interest or experience in urban environmental&#13;
issues.&#13;
(d)   Participation of NGOs and community organizations in the educational&#13;
progra . Just as appropriate NGOs and other groups should participate in&#13;
the design of the public awareness and educational program, they should have&#13;
a significant role in implementation of the program as well. Through local&#13;
networks and direct community involvement, they can be particularly effective&#13;
in raising public consciousness for addressing issues of concern.&#13;
ECOFONDO, through its membership of some 260 environmental NGOs,&#13;
should be helpful in identifying effective community organizations for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
Timeframe: The proposed public awareness/environmental education program would be for&#13;
the four years of the project, subject to annual review at the time of preparation of the Annual&#13;
Work Plan.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.7&#13;
Terms of Reference for Urban Environmental Information Systems and&#13;
Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation Systems&#13;
Background: Under Colombia's Law 99, the Environmental Management Agencies&#13;
(EMAs) of cities greater than one million inhabitants are responsible for establishing and&#13;
operating an Environmental Information System within their area of jurisdiction, according to&#13;
the directions and guidelines provided by MinAmbiente and IDEAM.&#13;
Objective: Under the Urban Environmental Management Project, such an Urban&#13;
Environmental Information System (UEIS) would be established by each of the EMAs to&#13;
manage and share environmental information, operating in association with an Environmental&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System (EMES), which would be used for monitoring compliance&#13;
with standards, assessing the state of the environment, and providing inputs to&#13;
decisionmakers involved in the the preparation and implementation of urban development and&#13;
environmental management strategies. The UEIS would include a component for-the&#13;
purposes of supporting the administrative functions of the EMA.&#13;
Scope and Tasks: This activity would involve the setting up of four systems, each requiring&#13;
a number of different steps, as detailed below.&#13;
1.   Information System for the Support of the EMA's Administrative Functions: This&#13;
system would facilitate the carrying out of the EMA's routine activities such as planning,&#13;
programmimg and budgeting, personnel administration, financial management and&#13;
accounting. Key activities in development of the system would be:&#13;
a) Evaluation of support needed for the carrying out of the EMA's administrative&#13;
processes&#13;
b) Identification of system requirements based on the EMA' s technical and&#13;
administrative functions and processes&#13;
c) Evaluation of the software options and development of applications to meet the&#13;
requirements identified in (b)&#13;
d) Physical and logical design of the system&#13;
e) Setting-up and test of the system&#13;
f) Training of personnel in the use of the system&#13;
2.    Information System for the Administration of Economic Instruments for&#13;
Environmental Management: This system would facilitate the application by the EMA (or&#13;
the local administration) of the economic instruments defined by Law 99 as incentives and&#13;
sources of finance for environmental management. Its design can thus only be undertaken&#13;
after the national and local regulations become available which will regulate the use of such&#13;
economic instruments for environmental and specify the technical guidelines for their&#13;
application. Key activities in development of this system would be:&#13;
66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a) Documentation of international experience for estimation and administration of&#13;
economic instruments&#13;
b) Design or adaptation of models for: (i) the calculation of taxes, (ii) methods of&#13;
billing, and (iii) payment procedures&#13;
c) Physical and logical design of the system, including an intelligent user-friendly&#13;
component accessible to the public&#13;
d) Setting-up and test of the system&#13;
e) Training of personnel in the use of the system&#13;
f) Dissemination and orientation to the public&#13;
g) Training of a sample of users&#13;
3.    Information System for Licensing and Enforcement of Environmental Regulations:&#13;
This system would facilitate the carrying out of the EMA's licensing and enforcement&#13;
functions, by providing easily accessible references on relevant processing procedures,&#13;
technical guidelines (e.g., typical TORs) and emission and ambient standards, as well as a&#13;
computerized framework for the processing of licenses and following through on compliance&#13;
with agreed-upon action plans. Design of this system depends on the previous definition,&#13;
operationalization and enforcement of environmental regulations. It would be articulated&#13;
with the Monitoring and Evaluation System (described in 4 below), from which it would&#13;
receive information (e.g., on emission levels by industries) and with the Information System&#13;
for the Administration of Economic Instruments for Environmental Management (described&#13;
in 2 above), to which it would provide information on pollution fees, licensing fees and other&#13;
funds generated by the application of the economic instruments specified in Law 99 . Key&#13;
activities to be carried out would comprise:&#13;
a) Identification of system requirements (e.g., licensing procedures)&#13;
b) Evaluation of methods currently in use to collect, process, report and store&#13;
information relative to the appropriate application of environmental regulations in&#13;
licensing activities and pollution control&#13;
c) Physical and logical design of the system, including an intelligent user-friendly&#13;
component accessible to the public&#13;
d) Setting-up and test of the system&#13;
e) Training of personnel in the use of the system&#13;
f) Dissemination and orientation to the public&#13;
g) Training of a sample of users&#13;
4.    Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation System: This system would generate, and&#13;
process information relating to water, air, land and other aspects of environmental safety, and&#13;
would assess and report on the state of the urban environment. It would be designed and set&#13;
up in such a way as to facilitate access to indicators of the state of the environment, the&#13;
preparation of projections, the design of control strategies and programs, the licensing of&#13;
activities, and the application of analytical models integrating urban, economic and social&#13;
variables. Design and operation of the system would be based on a network of institutions&#13;
67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
responsible for producing and using information relative to the state of the urban&#13;
environment, under the general coordination of the EMA. Key activities would comprise:&#13;
a) Definition of a basic conceptual model for indicator design&#13;
b) Definition of: (i) the users of the measurements to be produced; (ii) the types of&#13;
measurements needed for improved environmental management in the urban area;&#13;
(iii) the recommended sampling points, frequency and measurement procedures;&#13;
(iv) the analytical models to be used in generating environmental information; (v)&#13;
the quality assurance procedures to be employed; and (vi) the interface between&#13;
intitutions and sub-systems which generate and process information, assess and&#13;
report on environmental conditions&#13;
c) Evaluation of existing monitoring systems, the measurements produced, and their&#13;
compatibility and adaptability to the needs defined above&#13;
d) Identification of: (i) complementary measurement and indicator development&#13;
requirements; (ii) the network of institutions which would be involved in&#13;
monitoring, evaluating and disseminating environmental information; and (iii) a&#13;
strategy to develop, within the network of urban institutions, the required capacity&#13;
to carry out these activities&#13;
e) Design of the logical structure of the information system required to process the&#13;
information produced by the monitoring system, specifying sub-system modules&#13;
and information flows&#13;
f) Specification of: (i) the content and structure of each sub-system's data base; (ii)&#13;
procedures for gathering, transmitting, analyzing, and disseminating information&#13;
on levels of ambient quality and emissions from contaminating sources; (iii) the&#13;
reports and other outputs of the system; and (iv) the types of access, protection&#13;
and connections between different information systems and institutions which&#13;
either provide or use environmental information&#13;
g) Specification of: (i) the necessary software, hardware, measurement and&#13;
laboratory facilities and equipment; (ii) the human resources required to operate&#13;
the system (for instance, monitoring teams); (iii) training needs; (iv) the&#13;
institutional and organizational structure needed to manage the system; and (v)&#13;
the financial requirements for the operation of the system&#13;
h) Setting-up and test of the sub-system components&#13;
i) Training of personnel in measuring environmental quality and emissions, handling&#13;
information, and other aspects related to the operation of the Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation System&#13;
Institutional arrangements: The design of the UEIS and the EMES would be undertaken&#13;
by each EMA with the support of consultants and in close collaboration with MinAmbiente&#13;
and IDEAM. Two institutional mechanisms are envisaged to support this activity:&#13;
a) a Local Steering Committee, made up of representatives of key public agencies,&#13;
research centers and laboratories which are already relevant in generating or using&#13;
68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
information on the state of the environment or would be likely to participate in the&#13;
institutional network which would operate the proposed systems in the future; and&#13;
b) a Technical Working Group, established under the leadership of MinAmbiente and&#13;
IDEAM, with representation from the four urban centers, which (i) would allow&#13;
the exchange of experiences among the various cities; and (ii) would be&#13;
responsible for ensuring the necessary coordination and consistency in UEISs&#13;
across the various urban areas, as well as with IDEAM's and MinAmbiente's&#13;
guidelines with respect to the development and operation of environmental&#13;
information systems&#13;
Sequence of Activities: The design of the UEIS and the EMES would be undertaken by&#13;
each EMA in accordance with the following sequence of activities:&#13;
a) Establishment of the coordination mechanisms at the local level and with&#13;
MinAmbiente and IDEAM (and other regional and national agencies as needed)&#13;
(see above)&#13;
b) Preparation by each city, with the support of the local Steering Committee, of a&#13;
general proposal for the configuration of its UEIS and EMES and its linkages to&#13;
the National Environmental Information System&#13;
c) Approval of the general proposals by the Technical Working Group&#13;
d) Formulation, by each city, with the support of the Steering Committee, of a&#13;
general strategy for design and implementation of its UEIS and EMES, taking&#13;
into account: (i) management and information requirements defined in the UEMP&#13;
(preliminary results); and (ii) the minimal compatibility requirements identified by&#13;
the Technical Working Group&#13;
e) Approval of the general strategies by the Technical Working Group&#13;
f) Detailed design of the UEIS components and the EMES including training&#13;
programs and schedules for the acquisition of equipment&#13;
g) Review by the Technical Working Group of the annual work plans for&#13;
strengthening environmental monitoring capacity in the four cities and all other&#13;
proposals relating to the establishment or improvement of urban environmental&#13;
information systems, prior to the submission of such plans to the Project Steering&#13;
Committee described in para. 80 of the Technical Annex.&#13;
Timeframe: Activity a would take place prior to loan effectiveness. Activities b through_&#13;
above would be carried out during the first year of project implementation. Detailed design of&#13;
the UEIS components and of the EMES would take place in the following years, in&#13;
accordance with each city's general strategy, as defined in d above and approved by the&#13;
technical Working Group.&#13;
Budget: The budget for this activity varies for each of the EMAs, due to the different state&#13;
of readiness and existing framework in each of the cities. Further details of the budget for&#13;
this activity can be found in Annex 2.&#13;
69&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Project Implementation Plan and Monitoring Indicators&#13;
1.    This annex is divided into three sections. The first gives an overview of the timetable&#13;
of key project activities; the second discusses project administration and supervision&#13;
arrangements (including measures of project progress); and the third concentrates on&#13;
indicators of project outcome and impact.&#13;
2.    Project Implementation Schedule: Tables 4.1 and 4.2 present Gantt charts&#13;
summarizing the key project activities, together with their implementation timetable. Each of&#13;
the two project components are considered separately. In the case of Component 2, which&#13;
deals with institutional strengthening of the EMAs of the four major cities, a generic&#13;
timetable of typical project activities is displayed, due to the similarity of the cities' programs.&#13;
As discussed in the main report, the project would adopt a staged approach to gradually&#13;
consolidate DAHP and the EMAs over the four-year implementation period. for flexibility&#13;
and so as to better tailor the proposed technical assistance to the evolving needs and growing&#13;
experience of these new agencies, detailed programs for each of the sub-components would&#13;
be prepared and discussed with the Bank on an annual basis, and would be consolidated in&#13;
the Annual Work Plan for each agency. Furthermore, despite uniform subcomponent&#13;
headings, the program for each of the EMAs in Component 2 has a different emphasis based&#13;
on their specific needs and capacity.&#13;
3.    Project Supervision and Administration Plan: Currently, preliminary work plans&#13;
and TORs for activities to be carried out in 1996 have been submitted to the Bank, and are&#13;
available in the project files. For subsequent years, specific work plans and TORs for&#13;
activities to be carried out within each subcomponent would be detailed, as indicated above,&#13;
on a yearly basis. These plans and TORs would give a detailed timetable of the steps&#13;
(technical, procedural, and administrative) that would be undertaken for individual activities,&#13;
and would form the basis for measuring the progress of the project ("process indicators")&#13;
which would be used during the supervision of the project. Table 4.3 presents a summary of&#13;
the proposed Annual Work Plan preparation cycle.&#13;
5.    The standard supervision arrangements would be applicable for this project.&#13;
However, for the first year, an enhanced supervision effort on the part of the Bank is&#13;
proposed. The reasons for this are the innovative nature of the project, both for the&#13;
Government and the Bank, and the importance of adjusting the design of the technical&#13;
assistance program in subsequent years as DAHP and the four EMAs consolidate themselves&#13;
as environmental agencies and gain experience over 1996. (This would be the second year&#13;
of operation for all but one of the agencies involved in the project.) In addition, during the&#13;
first year of project implementation, DAHP and the EMAs will be preparing their medium-&#13;
term development strategies, on the basis of a thorough discussion of their priorities. The&#13;
assistance which the Bank could provide in these exercises would be especially relevant, as&#13;
they will help to define policy requirements and future urban investment needs.&#13;
70&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.    Project Performance Indicators: Table 4.4 gives a summary of the indicators that&#13;
would form the basis of reviewing the outcomes and impacts for each of the subcomponents&#13;
of the project.&#13;

            Colombia - Urban Environmental Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Urban
            Environmental Management Project is to support
            implementation of Colombia's National Environmental
            Policy and the improvement of environmental management
            capacity in the country's urban areas through: 1)
            strengthening MinAmbiente's capacity to provide policy
            advice and technical assistance to Colombian cities; and 2)
            strengthening environmental management agencies (EMAs) in
            the urban centers of Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and
            Barranquilla.  In support of this primary objective, the
            project will also help establish those components of the
            National Environmental Information System (NEIS), both at
            the national and local levels, which are instrumental to the
            improvement of urban environmental management.  The
            technical assistance project will consist of two components:
            1) design and implementation of a technical assistance
            strategy through MinAmbiente/Directorate of Human
            Settlements and Population in MinAmbiente (DAHP) for cities
            of less than one million inhabitants; and 2) institutional
            strengthening of the EMAs of the country's four main
            urban centers.
