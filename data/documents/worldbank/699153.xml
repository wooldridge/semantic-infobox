ratio (calculated by measuring the risk content of&#13;
lFC's assets in relation to the sum of paid-in capital&#13;
and retained carnings) was 2.1:1. This is well within&#13;
the policvguidelines of 2.7:1 approved bythcBoard in&#13;

of 48 percent). IFC's debt-to-equity ratio-outstand-&#13;

capital and retained earnings-was 1.71:1 atyear-end,&#13;

IFC borrowed nearly $1.3 billion in the international&#13;
financial markets in fiscal 1993, compared with&#13;
$664 million in fiscal 1992. The Corporation now has&#13;
a total of $4.6 billion in bonds outstanding in the&#13;
international financial markets. Its triple-A ratings&#13;
have enabled it to borrow at very satisfactory rates,&#13;
the average cost to IFC of its borrowings in fiscal&#13;
1993 being 35 basis points below six-month LIBOR.&#13;
During the year IFC's Board of Directors authorized&#13;
a warrant issuance program that will contribute to&#13;
lowering IFC's funding costs.&#13;
IFCs Board of Governors approved a $1 billion gen-&#13;

which supported the expansion of IFC's operations&#13;

A measure of a societ's health is its access to clean&#13;

The efficient movement of people and goods and&#13;
availability of electric power determine a country's&#13;
ability to compete in modern industrial markets. The&#13;
ability to communicate swiftly and globally is critical&#13;
to business success. The foundation for all develop-&#13;
ment, infrastructure services are vital to all members&#13;
of society and to all economic sectors.&#13;
Unfortuniately, infrastructure in much of the develop-&#13;
ing world is neglected and in urgent need of major&#13;
capital expenditures. IFC, in its expanding role as an&#13;
investor in infrastructure projects, is demonstrating&#13;
that the private sector can provide the impetus to&#13;
invest in infrastructure. These investments are critical&#13;
to the achievement of equitable, sustainable economic&#13;
growth in the developing world.&#13;

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ADVISORY&#13;
SERVICES&#13;
Demand is strong for IFC advisory services in the&#13;
European countries in transition. IFC provided&#13;
advice and technical assistance to govemments and&#13;
businesses in more than 10 countries on a wide range&#13;
of issues; in addition, the Polish Business Advisory&#13;
Service provided assistance to Polish entrepreneurs.&#13;
The most noteworthy advisory assignments involved&#13;
preparing and implementing, with backing from&#13;
USAID and the U.K. Know-How Fund, the privatiza-&#13;
tions of hundreds of large companies and thousands&#13;
of small enterprises in Russia as well as scores of small&#13;
firms in Ukraine. IFC designed privatizations that are&#13;
being used as models in both countries. In Russia IFC&#13;
participated in the auctioning off of both large and&#13;
small state enterprises as well as the dismantling and&#13;
privatization of a regional trucking monopoly. [FC is&#13;

Auctions of small enterprises began in Nizhny Novgorod infiscal 1992 and continued duringfiscal 1993. To speed up&#13;
theprocess, enterprises were liquidted before sal and only assets were transferrd to the new owners By May 1993&#13;
645 enterpriss had been sold in the cty and twice that number in the surrounding oblast (administrative region). In&#13;
Volgogrd,4 where more than 950 small enterprises have been privatized through auctins, a modified approach was&#13;
adopted-the enterprises weresoldasgoingconcerns, and their liabilities and employee obligations were transferred to&#13;
*th new owners Based on its experience in both regions, IFC was asked bygovernment authorities toprepare a manual&#13;
on small-stale privatization which was widely distributed to loa officiaLs OtherRussian cities are now receiving&#13;

FUTURE P'LANS&#13;
A key goal during fiscal 1994 will be to improve&#13;
the environmental review process, with a focus on&#13;
providing better guidance and support to sponsors&#13;
of category B projects and financial intermediarics,&#13;
using tools and materials developed during fiscal&#13;
1993. Training of project sponsors, financial inter-&#13;
mediaries, and IFC staff on environmental assess-&#13;
ment, environmental management, and related topics&#13;
will be emphasized.&#13;
IFC plans to increase the number of its operations in&#13;
the environmental sector and to develop mechanisms&#13;
to increase the access of small and medium-scale&#13;
enterprises to GEF funding. IFC will also explore&#13;
possible roles in private sector projects that could&#13;
contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas&#13;
emissions and have a beneficial effect on the global&#13;
cnrvronment.&#13;

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
NOTEA- SUMMARY OP SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
0The accounting and reporting policiesof the Corporation are in conforniltywit' gcenerilly=acepted accounting prncl-&#13;
ples In the United Slates and with International Accounting Standards. The Corporation's amets and liabilities arc&#13;
recorded principallyon the historical cost basis and tie accrunl method of accounilng Is followed, except where otlier-&#13;
wisc noted.&#13;
Translation of Currencies-Assets and liabilities not denominated In United States dollars, with the exception of&#13;
disbursed equity lnvestments, are expremcd In United States dollars at the npproximnate exchange rates prevailing at&#13;
June 30, 1993, and June 30, 1992. lhnslation gains and loses are credited or cliarged to income. Disbursed equity&#13;
investments are expressed In United States dollars at the cxchange rntes thait applied at the timc of disbursement.&#13;
I-n'estmcnts-lnvestrnent commitments are recorded when agreemcnts are signed by the Corporation and are reflected&#13;
as assets when disbursed. Loan investments are generally carried at the principal amounts outstanding. It is the Corpo-&#13;
-rtion's practice to obtain collateral security such as, but not limited to, mortgages and third-party guarantces. Equity&#13;
investments are carried at cost and occasionally the Corporation enters into put option agreements.&#13;
Resenre againstLosses-The reserve against losses represents management's judgment as to identifiable losses on&#13;
specific investments with a significant and relatively permanent decline in value, and an estimate of potential losses&#13;
not specifically providd4 for. The reserve is established through annual charges to income in the form of a provision for&#13;
losses on investments. Investments written off, as well as any subsequent recovcries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
Revenue Recognition-Dividends and profit participations are recorded as income when received in freely convertible&#13;
currencies. Gains on the sale of investments are measured against the average cost of the investmcnts sold and are&#13;
credited to income when received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
Interest and commitment fees are recorded as income on an accrual basis. All other fees nre recorded as income when&#13;
received. The Corporation does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest&#13;
or principal are past due more than sixty days unless management anticipates that collection of interest will occrr in the&#13;
near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is reversed out of current income and is there-&#13;
after recognized as income only when actual payrnent is received. Interest not previously recognized, but capitaiized as&#13;
part of a debt restructuring, is recorded as deferred income and credited to current income only when the related prin-&#13;
cipal maturity is received. Fees and costs associated with loan origination are recognized when incurred as the net of&#13;
these amounts is not material.&#13;
Deposits and Securties-The Corporation's liquid assets are segregated into two pooh that are valued at either cost or&#13;
market Both poDIs comprise instruments issued by government agencies and financial institutions and are recorded on&#13;
a trade date basis. Investments valued at cost are usually held to maturity. Investments valued at market are invested&#13;
according to the Corporation's credit risk and duration policies. Gains and losses on sales of securities valued at cost,&#13;
as measured by the difference between cost on a last-in, first-out basis and proceeds of the sales, are recorded as an&#13;
element of income from deposits and securities. The Corporation classifies the cash, deposits, and securities portfolio as&#13;
an element of liquidity in the Statement of Cash Flows, because of their nature and the Corporation's policies governing&#13;
the level and use of such investments.&#13;
Off-Balance SheetFinancial Instruments-In the normal course of business, the Corporation is a party to off-balance&#13;
sheet financial instruments including currency and interest rate swap obligations, commodity-indexed swaps, options&#13;
and forward contracts on its own behalf and for dients, guarantees for third parties, futures contracts, short sales, and&#13;
forward rate agreements. The Corporation follows the same credit policies in considering conditional obligations as it&#13;
does for balance sheet instruments. Associated income or expenses on swaps and forward agreements are recognized&#13;
over the life of the instrument. Gains and losses on futures contracts and short sales are recognized as an element of&#13;
income from deposits and securities.&#13;
Where it acts as a swap, option, or forward contract intermediary, the Corporation minimizes its exposure to credit risk&#13;
by performing credit reviews of the clients, and minimizes its exposure to currency and interest rate risks by entering&#13;
into offietting swap, option, or forward contract positions with market coaunterparties.&#13;

At June 30, 1993,31% (50%-l992) of the deposits antd securities portfolio was valued at market. The remainderof the&#13;
portfolio, which is usually held to maturity, is composed mostly of time deposit instruments and government securities&#13;
having a duration of less than one year and is valued at cost that approximates market. The deposits and securities port-&#13;
rolio is denominated primarily in United States dollars with instruments in non-dollar currencies representing 5.8% of&#13;
the portfolio at June 30,1993 (7.6%-11992). At June 30, 1993 and 1992, cash collatcral invested and purchased securi-&#13;
ties not setlcd were valued at market that approximates cost and were denominated in United States dollars.&#13;
At June 30, 1993, the Corporation had gross receivables from covered forward agreements at a book value of $427 mil-&#13;
lion ($664 million-1992) and gross payables from covered fbrward agreements at a book valuc of $425 million&#13;
($704 million-1992). The Corporation's exposurc to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties&#13;
was $6 million at June 30,1993 ($1 million-1992).At June 30,1993, the Corporation also had futures contracts with a&#13;
total contract valuc of $150 omillion ($186 million-1992) with minimal exposure to credit loss. The Corporation is&#13;
highly selective in its choice of counterparties and does not consider nonperformance to represent a significant risk.&#13;
The Corporation has entered into short sales of securitics not held in the Corporation's portfolio at the ime of the sale&#13;
with a total contract value of $10 million at June 30, 1993 ($56 million-1992). The Corporation bears the risk that the&#13;
market value of the securities will move adverscly between the time of the sale and the time the securities must be delivered.&#13;
The Corporation also has cntered into interest rate swap agreements on liquid assets with respect to notional principal&#13;
amounts of $630 million at June 30,1993 ($82 million-1992) under which it is obligated to make interest payments on&#13;
a fixed-rate basis in exchange for receiving variable-rate payments. The differential to be paid or received as interest&#13;
rates change is recognized over the life of the agreement. At June 30, 1993, the.Corporation also had currency swap&#13;
agreemcnts on liquid assets with gross receivables at a book value of$S 139 million (nl-i 992) and gross payables at a&#13;
book value of $142 million (nil-1992). Exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these&#13;
swap agreements is considered insignificant.&#13;

Principal and interest are payable in the currenry borrowed. Under its borrowing agreements, the Corporation is not&#13;
permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than purchase money security interests) without&#13;
extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
The $3 million net receivable on currency swaps at June 30,1993, shown in the above table, consists of swap transac-&#13;
tions in netreceivablepositions of $175 million ($225 million-1992) and swap transactions in net payable positions of&#13;
$172 million ($10 million-1992); these amounts result from exchange rate movements occurring subsequent to the&#13;
date ofthe swap transactions. At June30, 1993, die Corporation had gross receivables from borrowing-rdated currency&#13;
swaps at a book value of $2,460 million ($2,139 million-1992) and gross payables from borrowing-related currency&#13;
swaps at abookvalue of $2,457 million ($1,924 million-1992).As a result of the currency and interest rate swap trans-&#13;
actions, the weighted average cost of market borrowings may differ from the weighted average rates reflected in the&#13;

In addition, undrawn balances on committed borrowings from the IBRD were $161 million ($246 million-1992).&#13;
*- - -   -  A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn balances of borrowings at 314 of 1% per annum. For the year ended&#13;
June 30,1993, such commitment fees aggregated $0.6 million ($1.9 miltion-1992) and are included in the weighted&#13;
;  tn .   average cost of borrowings.&#13;
The Corporation has also entered into interest rate swap agreements with respect to notional principal amounts of&#13;
*-           $2,208 million ($1,705 million-1992) under which it is obligated to make interest payments on a variable-rate basis,&#13;
!  ', .  . .   averaging 3.38% at June 30,1993 (4.27%-1992) in exchange for receiving fixed-rate payments, averaging 7.72% at&#13;
June30, 1993 (8.39%-1992). The differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is recognized over the life&#13;
of.theagreement.&#13;
The Corporation could be exposed to aedit loss in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties in the aggregate&#13;
amount of $326 million at June 30,1993 ($274 million-1992) for outstanding currency swaps, and $171 million&#13;
($102 mlllion-1992) for outstanding interest rate swaps. These amounts represent the maximum estimated replace-&#13;
ment cost, at market rates, of those outstanding swaps in a gain position. However, the Corporation is highly selective&#13;
in its choice of counterparties and does not consider nonperformance to represent a significant risk.&#13;
The Corporation issued 4 million put warrants on June 30,1993, and purchased matching over-the-counter call&#13;
* -;        options to hedge the warrants. Income and expense from warrant transactions are recognized as an dement of charges&#13;
on borrowings. The cash settlement value of the warrants and options is induded in other liabilities pending closing&#13;

Facility (APDF), the South Pacific Project Facility (SPPF), and the Polish Business Advisory Service (PBAS). During the&#13;

($1.2 million-1992), $200,000 to SPPF ($200,000-1992), and $500,000 to PBAS ($500,000-1992).&#13;
-                     NOTE K-ESTILED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,"Disclosures about FairValue of Financial Instruments,' requires&#13;
entities to disclose infornation about the estimated fair values of their financial instruments, whether or not those&#13;
values are recognized on the balance sheet. Since many of the Corporation's financial instruments lack a trading&#13;
i f                     market, characterized as exchanges between willing buyers and sellers, subjective estimates and present value calcula-&#13;
tions of future cash flowswere used to estimate the fairvalues to satisfythis disclosure requirement Deternining future&#13;
cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and minor changes in assumptions or methodologies&#13;
may materially effect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference between the carrying&#13;
-                       amounts and the fair values presented do not necessarily reflect the realizable values since, in the majority of cases,&#13;
the Corporation generally holds loan and other financial instmments to maturity with the aim of realizing their&#13;
recorded values.&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environment as of June 30, 1993, but not the effects of interest rate&#13;
fluctuations for any period preceding or following that date. In different interest rate environments, fair value results&#13;
can differ significantly, especially for certain fixed-rate financial instruments. Reasonable comparability of fair values&#13;
among financial institutions is not likely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous&#13;
estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards intro-&#13;
duces a greater degree of subjectivity to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore, while disdosure of estimated&#13;
fair values of financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in using this data for purposes of evaluating the&#13;
financial condition of the Corporation. The fair values of the individual instruments do not represent the fair value of&#13;
the Corporation taken as a whole.&#13;
The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estirnate fair values as of June 30,1993, Wflow:&#13;
InterestRate and Foreign Exchange Contnacts-Fair values for interest rate and currency swaps were derived by&#13;
determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates. Fair values for covered&#13;
forward agreements were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. The resulting fair values of these&#13;
instruments are reflected in the fair value of the related assets and liabilities with the exception of the fair value of inter-&#13;
mediary swaps executed on behalf of dients, which are disclosed separately. Fair value for currency options was based&#13;
on pncing models and fair value for warrants was based on quoted nmarket prices.&#13;
Loan Investments and Commitments-The Corporation, which extends loans to entities operating in the private sector&#13;
in its developing member countries, does not generally sell its loans from the portfolio and there is no comparable sec-&#13;
ondary market. Fair values for fixed-rate loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow&#13;
model based on a discount rate comprising the fixed-rate loan spread plus the period-end estimated cost of funds. Since&#13;
rates on variable-rate loans and loan commitments are reset on a quarterly or six-month basis, the carrying value&#13;
adjusted fior credit risk was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. The Corporation also holds options to&#13;
convert loans into equity of certain of its investee companies. Fair values of these conversion options are based on&#13;
-   quoted market prices or other calculated values of the underlying equity.&#13;
Equity Investments-Fair values were determined using market prices where available, put option prices, book values,&#13;
or cost, certain of which were discounted based upon managemnent's estimate of net realizable value. Where market&#13;
pnces were not available or alternate valuation techniques were not practical, cost was detemined to be the best esti-&#13;
:       :    -      rnmate of fair value. Management's estimate of fair value takes into consideration the relative ilhiquidity and volatility,&#13;
;-s wett as the overall business constraints, in the emerging markets in which the Corporation invests.&#13;

StaffRetimentPlan-The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a defined benefit&#13;
retirement Pln covering substantially all of the staff of the Corporation, the IBRD, and the Multilateral Investment&#13;
Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Under the Plan, benefits are based on years of service and average compensation, with the&#13;
staff contributing a fixed permtage of pensionable remuneration and the Corporation, the IBRD, and MIGA contnb-&#13;
uting the remainder of the actuariaUy determined cost of funding future Plan benefits. The total contribution is based&#13;
upon the aggregate funding method. All contnbutions to the Plan and all other assets and income held for purposes&#13;
of the Plan are held separately from the other assets and income of the Corporation, the IBRD, and MIGA and can be&#13;
used only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid&#13;
or provided for. The total expense allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 1993, was $16.1 million&#13;
($12.0 million-1992).&#13;
:OdzerPost-EmploymentBenejlts--The IBRD also provides certain life insurance and medical benefits to substantially&#13;
a retired staff of the Corporation, the IBRD, and MIGA and their spouses through contnbutions to a Retired Staff&#13;
Benefits Plan (RSBP). The Corporation accrues and finds, on an actuarially determined basis, the expected ftiture cost&#13;
of providing such benefits for future retirees. All contnbutions to the RSBP and all other assets and income held for&#13;
purposes of the RSBP are held separatcly from the other assets and income of the Corporation, the IBRD, and MIGA&#13;
and can be used only for the benefit of the partidpants in the RSBP and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them&#13;
have been paid or provided for. The total expense allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 1993, was&#13;

those areas where common services can be efficiently provided by the IBRD. This includes shared costs of the Boards&#13;
of Governors and Directors, and other services such as internal auditing, administrative support, office occupanc,&#13;

-* ;        Contingencies-The Corporation has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Texas&#13;
(Houston) -in connection with an equity investment. The Corporation's management believes the complaint is without&#13;
merit and intends to contest the action vigorously. The case is in its early stages and the amount of loss, if any, cannot be&#13;
determined at this time. After consultation with counsd, management believes that an unflvorable outcome is not&#13;
probable and that it is not likely to have a material effect on the Corporation's balance sheet or statement of income.&#13;
Even if judgment for the full amount daimed in the lawsuit were rendered, management is of the opinion that the&#13;
Corporation's ability to meet its obligations would not be affected.&#13;

in sub-Saharan Africa, in some of the formerYugoslav&#13;

loan collection rate declined, and the principal out-&#13;
standing on nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the&#13;

loans in some ofthe formerYugoslav republics. Signif-&#13;
