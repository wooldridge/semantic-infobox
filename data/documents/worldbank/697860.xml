ECUADOR&#13;
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
A. Creating Institutional Capacity for Strategic Planning for&#13;
Privatization and Divestiture of State enterprises in Ecuador&#13;
I. Background&#13;
1.    Privatization and divestiture have proceeded slowly but steadily in Ecuador. The&#13;
privatization program has covered largely equity holdings in small enterprises,&#13;
landholding and buildings. However, there has not been an over arching strategy for the&#13;
privatization and divestiture of state enterprises. Nor has there been a strategic vision&#13;
of future privatization or ways to incorporate the learning to date in one institution&#13;
capable of giving a strategic vision for privatization and generating public support&#13;
through clearly defined and transparent processes. As the country enters the next stage&#13;
of privatization, divestiture and concession granting, such a vision will be crucial in&#13;
order to undertake the larger transactions. Hence there is a clear need to provide such&#13;
a capacity as the country goes ahead with the large privatizations such as in&#13;
telecommunications and electricity.&#13;
2.    Although the State Modernization Law, which was enacted in December 1993,&#13;
established that the State Modernization Council was going to take the leadership for the&#13;
strategic planning for privatization and divestiture of state enterprises in Ecuador,&#13;
CONAM's institutional capacity remains to be built up. It currently lacks experienced&#13;
technical staff to develop such a strategic vision and advise CONAM's management&#13;
accordingly. CONAM's capacity to efficiently coordinate with other agencies involved&#13;
in the state modernization process must also be developed. CONAM should be capable&#13;
of maintaining the public informed about the government reform program but also of&#13;
wining public confidence and support. Finally, CONAM should be capable of creating&#13;
a consistent strategy among the different agencies charged with the responsibility for&#13;
privatization, divestiture and granting of concessions.&#13;
II. Institutional Support&#13;
3.    To promote CONAM's strategic planning capacity, it is proposed to establish a&#13;
small strategic planning unit staffed with consultants experienced in privatization and&#13;
divestiture. They will work with the regular staff of CONAM on a daily basis,&#13;
developing a strategic vision for privatization from a technical standpoint, bringing to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
attention of CONAM's management emerging issues in privatization, and assisting the&#13;
management in developing a strategic vision for privatization, divestiture and granting&#13;
of concession. Such a vision would be disseminated widely to promote public awareness&#13;
and support as well as guide other agencies involved in these activities.&#13;
m. Consultants' Proriles and Tasks&#13;
4.    Expertise is required in the following areas:&#13;
(i)   competition policy and regulatory aspects;&#13;
(ii)  legal aspects; and&#13;
(iii)  valuation and pricing aspects.&#13;
5.    Competition and Regulatory Policy Analyst. The consultant should have a wide&#13;
experience in competition policy and regulation in similar contexts to adapt the&#13;
experience of other countries in order to create a competitive environment in Ecuador.&#13;
The consultant will review the overall competition and regulatory provisions established&#13;
in the Law of the Modernization of the State and determine the extent to which the&#13;
underlying regulatory regime prevailing in a specific sector could be adopted for the&#13;
privatization, divestiture and the granting of concessions in different sectors. The review&#13;
of these environments across sectors would allow the formulation of an overall wide&#13;
strategy promoting a competitive environment.&#13;
6.    The consultant would be available to give technical advice in this area to other&#13;
entities undertaking privatizations, divestiture and the granting of concessions. It is&#13;
envisaged that the task will be completed after a period of two to three years, once that&#13;
expertise is imparted to the staff of CONAM, and that the institution becomes adept at&#13;
analyzing the strategic issues in competition and regulatory policies across the different&#13;
sectors.&#13;
7.    Legal Exper on Privatization, Divestiture and the Granting of Concessions.&#13;
The consultant would have wide ranging experience with privatization, divestiture and&#13;
granting of concessions on an inter-country basis. The consultant will need to be&#13;
knowledgeable in the systemic law of the country as established by the Law of&#13;
Modernization of the State, as well as the laws relating to different sectors at the&#13;
transaction level. The consultant would need to give advice on the reconciliation of any&#13;
conflicts between the overall laws and transaction related laws, recommend amendments&#13;
to the laws when required and advice CONAM management on the refinement of the&#13;
existing legal norms to bring about a competitive environment with transparent laws and&#13;
implementable regulations to achieve privatization, divestiture and the granting of&#13;
concession. The consultant will work closely with the competition policy and regulatory&#13;
analyst and the staff of CONAM to ensure compatibility of the laws relating to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
privatization, divestiture and the granting of concessions and provide the basis for a&#13;
strategic vision for creating the proper competitive environment through laws and&#13;
regulations. It is envisaged that the task will be completed after a period of 2 to 3 years.&#13;
8.    Valuation and pricing specialist. The consultant will have wide inter-country,&#13;
sector and transactions experience to value enterprises to be put up for sale, other forms&#13;
of divestiture and to cost concessions. The consultant will provide a framework for such&#13;
valuations taking into account the tax, regulatory and reporting practices prevailing in&#13;
Ecuador and help facilitate transactions in a wide range of activities. The consultant will&#13;
develop guidelines for the pre-qualification of bids based on the business plans provided&#13;
by the potential buyers of enterprises and bidders for concessions. The consultant will&#13;
need to evaluate the economic implications of different regulatory policies and advise&#13;
CONAM's management and staff on the suitability of specific valuation methods,&#13;
practices and conventions to ensure that the valuation and pricing process are established&#13;
in a clear and transparent way. This would help to allay any accusations of unfair bids&#13;
and cozy relationships between the sellers and the buyers. It is envisaged that the task&#13;
will be completed after a period of 2 to 3 years.&#13;
IV Strategic Planning Unit: Organization and Financing&#13;
9.    The Strategic Planning Unit will be established within CONAM and report to the&#13;
Director of CONAM. As indicated earlier, the consultants will be hired for a term&#13;
which will not exceed three years. They will be financed under the project once their&#13;
detailed Terms of Reference, biodata and contracts have been approved by the Bank.&#13;
B. Guidelines for Privatization, Divestiture and Granting of Concessions&#13;
I. Background&#13;
10.    A  common set of guidelines issued by a central agency charged with&#13;
privatizations, divestiture and granting of concessions would contribute much to the&#13;
coordination of these efforts that are currently dispersed among various agencies of&#13;
government. There are two main reasons for the use of such guidelines. First, it is an&#13;
essential element of transparency of the process.  Second, to the extent that other&#13;
agencies follow the guidelines, they will provide a common framework and help to&#13;
increase competitive forces in the economy even among various sectors. Adherence to&#13;
a set of guidelines would also make implementation easy across the country. It would&#13;
help to provide a common regulatory environment, standardized methods of divestiture&#13;
and make overall supervision of a privatization and concession granting program easier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
11.   Since the state enterprises that are to be privatized, divested or public services&#13;
granted as concessions are in different sectors, it is not realistic for each and every case&#13;
to follow every provision of the guidelines closely. Only the main principles need to be&#13;
followed. In some cases, the actual privatization would follow a standard path as&#13;
described in the guidelines. In other cases, the guidelines would only provide some&#13;
principles. Nevertheless there is merit in developing a common set of guidelines and&#13;
adopting them on a national basis.&#13;
12.   CONAM is the agency that would issue such guidelines. It has a high powered&#13;
board of directors, including a representative form the President's office, and it will have&#13;
the technical expertise to issue and implement the guidelines. Towards that end, some&#13;
broad guidelines are described below. These are related to the different stages of&#13;
privatization, divestiture and the granting of concession. They follow the stages of a&#13;
transaction - the identification of the privatization or divestiture program, preparation for&#13;
sale or concession, actual sale or transfer and finally, safeguards to prevent changes in&#13;
the regulatory environment following a privatization, divestiture or the graining of a&#13;
concession.&#13;
II. Guidelines.&#13;
13.    The identification of enterprises for early privatization can be based on the&#13;
tradeability of the activity in question. If the activity to be privatized is in a sector&#13;
subject to international competition, that provides a ready made situation of competition.&#13;
Small and medium size firms are easy to privatize as they or the sector in which they&#13;
operate need not be restructured prior to privatization. They can be sold directly.&#13;
14.   State owned enterprises in the non-tradeable sector, typically utilities, that have&#13;
a natural monopoly character require the creation of a competitive environment through&#13;
legal and regulatory changes as well as some restructuring. The form of transfer or&#13;
ownership of function of a utility can be different, depending on each circumstance.&#13;
Their large size, labor implications and high political profile makes the process more&#13;
difficult, but necessary. The absence of such legal regulatory frameworks can reduce&#13;
consumer welfare and diminish public support for privatization.&#13;
15.   There are different ways to create efficiency. Changing ownership is only one,&#13;
but the most powerful one to bring about efficiency. Other means could be used such&#13;
as management contracts, leases, contracting out and concessions. However, these forms&#13;
could contribute less to the reduction of the size of the State, an objective of the&#13;
modernization of the State. Also, a possible problem with leasing and concession&#13;
arrangements is that they may not provide sufficient incentives to maintain and expand&#13;
the facilities in their charge. A private supplier that does not own the production&#13;
facilities or is uncertain of contract renewal, may depreciate assets rapidly for short-run&#13;
gain and skimp on routine maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
16.   The primary aim of privatization is to increase efficiency and not to increase&#13;
revenue. The sale of state owned companies in protected markets will detract from&#13;
efficiency even though short run gains in revenue can be made.&#13;
17.   Sale of state owned companies should be made on equal basis to both nationals&#13;
and foreign purchasers as provided by the recent investment laws that give national status&#13;
to foreign owned entities. Some discretion could prevail when the foreign purchaser is&#13;
another state owned entity. Thus, a sale or granting of concessions must be on the basis&#13;
of wide competition, both domestic and foreign.&#13;
18.  In restructuring state enterprises for sale, large investments should be avoided,&#13;
since there are greater risks involved in such a strategy.  Instead, the important&#13;
components of preparation for sale are carrying out legal, managerial and organization&#13;
changes, financial workouts and labor shedding.&#13;
19.   Labor can be co-opted to support the privatization and  the granting of&#13;
concessions by offer of shares. Some part of the shares could be retained earmarked for&#13;
labor for later sale since the value of the remaining shares is expected to increase with&#13;
the improvements in the regulatory environment, and with managerial and efficiency&#13;
gains. Labor does not lose in privatization, if adequate attention is paid to the social cost&#13;
of unemployment, through severance pay, unemployment benefits, retraining and job&#13;
search assistance.&#13;
20.   The best form of the sale is in an open market for cash. However, given the size&#13;
of some sales, the limited development of the stock market and the difficulties of valuing&#13;
assets in a changing regulatory, financial and legal environment, negotiated settlements,&#13;
special financial arrangements and debt-equity swaps are available means to effect the&#13;
sale.&#13;
21.   All that is possible to do to increase transparency of the transaction must be done.&#13;
This implies a large public information effort from the time a decision is made to&#13;
privatize to the ultimate sale or the granting of concessions.&#13;
22.   Efforts to improve the legal environment must go beyond the sale to ensure that&#13;
the parties to the sale are legally bound to meet all the provisions of the agreement at the&#13;
time of the sale. This would prevent the reversal of the agreement by either party to it.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
ECUADOR&#13;
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
POWER SECTOR REFORM&#13;
I. Background&#13;
Regulatory Structure&#13;
1.    The sector is not well organized. Although there are several agencies responsible&#13;
for energy activities, there is neither an agency to set energy policies nor one to regulate&#13;
electricity tariffs and the quality of service. The MEM is responsible for establishing and&#13;
enforcing energy policies. A Higher Council of Energy was created to coordinate energy&#13;
policies with the policies of other sectors. Its main functions are to: set national energy&#13;
policies and submit them for approval of the President of the Republic; approve and&#13;
supervise execution of the Master Energy Plan prepared by the National Energy Institute&#13;
(INE); and regulate energy sector activities. To date the Council has not been operative.&#13;
On paper, INE advises MEM on energy policies and coordinates sector planning; it is&#13;
also responsible for the formulation of power policies, long-term planning and setting of&#13;
prices. In practice, INECEL fulfills the dual role of both producing electricity and&#13;
regulating the sector. However, the country's largest distribution company, EMELEC&#13;
is not regulated by INECEL, but directly by the MEM.&#13;
Power Facilities and Market&#13;
2.    Between 1980 and 1992, total installed capacity increased 2.4 times, from 956&#13;
MW to 2279 MW, as shown in Figure 1. In 1991, INECEL's installed capacity was&#13;
1692 MW, of which 1300 MW (77 percent) was hydro and 392 MW (23 percent)&#13;
conventional thermal plants. Regional companies have installed 588 MW, of which 171&#13;
MW is hydro and 417 MW is thermal plants. About 8 percent of the installed thermal&#13;
capacity owned by INECEL and 31 percent by the distribution companies is out-of-&#13;
service due to lack of maintenance and needs to be rehabilitated. To meet electricity&#13;
demand, the sector now relies mainly on hydro generation and only uses thermal sources&#13;
in an emergency. During the dry season, hydro generation is restricted because the&#13;
capacity of the largest reservoir storage at the Paute hydro plants (1075 MW) is limited&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
to about five days of production. Paute is         INALLED caOTY&#13;
also chronically affected by a large&#13;
amount of sedimentation, reducing the life &#13;
of its reservoir.  Following torrential  X..&#13;
rains in April 1993, Paute reservoir&#13;
received an estimated 3.5 million cubic   . .                             X&#13;
meters of sedimentation, exacerbating    . .. .                       X&#13;
even more this problem and obliging to&#13;
stop the plant for one week. The plant&#13;
then resumed operations at full capacity.  so           i   . .           &#13;
This sedimentation problem  obliges to                    _&#13;
have a dredge permanently operating in          H       ITHEL M&amp;AL&#13;
the reservoir and will most probably Figure 1&#13;
exacerbate further the country's chronic&#13;
deficit in electricity.&#13;
3.    The second largest hydroelectric plant, Agoyan is essentially run-of-the-river.&#13;
The other hydro-electric plant with significant storage capacity is Pisayambo, which,&#13;
despite its small installed capacity, has a reservoir with capacity for about three months&#13;
of operation. During the first quarter of 1992, the vulnerability of the system to a severe&#13;
dry season (on average every five years) was evident. The drought considerably lowered&#13;
reservoir levels; total thermal plant capacity was not enough to supply the demand, so&#13;
the authorities established periodic supply cuts lasting up to 12 hours a day.&#13;
4.    There is an interconnected national grid of 230 kV, 820 km, which connects the&#13;
hydro-power plants with the major consumption centers of Quito and Guayaquil. A&#13;
dispatch center is under construction and will be commissioned by July 1994. There are&#13;
about 1205 km of 138 kV transmission lines connecting smaller plants and load centers.&#13;
The distribution system includes lines from 22 kV to 69 kV, totalling about 3130 km.&#13;
There is also a small interconnection with Colombia at 34.5 kV that allows Ecuador to&#13;
exchange energy with Colombia.&#13;
5.    The degree of electrification in Ecuador (75 percent) is slightly above average for&#13;
Latin American countries (70 percent). 95 percent of the urban population and 52&#13;
percent of the rural population had access to electricity in 1991. Gross generation has&#13;
increased 7.7 percent p.a. during the last decade, but energy sales have only increased&#13;
6.6 percent yearly, because power losses increased more rapidly (para. 15). Total sector&#13;
sales amounted to about 5410 GWh, representing an annual electricity consumption of&#13;
about 540 kWh per capita, which is significantly lower than the average 1034 kWh for&#13;
the region. As shown in Figure 2, the composition of electricity sales was 39 percent&#13;
residential, 15 percent commercial, 30 percent industrial, and 16 percent other customers&#13;
(mainly government agencies). Other sales have grown more rapidly than the rest of sales&#13;
during the last decade (about 13 percent p.a.). Total registered customers amounted to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8-&#13;
1.6 million, of which 1.4 million are           ELECTOTY UUIJ (w)&#13;
residential customers, while there are&#13;
about 150,000 illegal connections.     :&#13;

The Power System Expansion Plan&#13;
6.    INECEL's  expansion   plan&#13;
forecasts an average annual growth of 5.4&#13;
percent in the most favorable scenario and   .  .                         .&#13;
4.5 percent under a pessimistic scenario&#13;
for the period 1994-2000. A least cost    E      c                 CM&#13;
expansion program  was designed by  Figure 2&#13;
INECEL using adequate computer&#13;
models. The study assumed a GDP growth between 4 percent for the most favorable&#13;
scenario and 3 percent p.a. for a pessimistic scenario. The expansion plan includes the&#13;
following main projects:&#13;
(a)   the rehabilitation of 112 MW  of internal combustion units, which are&#13;
out-of-service for lack of maintenance. This investment is under way and&#13;
scheduled to be completed by the end of 1994;&#13;
(b)   the installation of gas turbines to be commissioned till December 1995 (80 MW);&#13;
(c)   the installation of a 125 MW steam thermal plant to be commissioned in 1997;&#13;
(d)   the 130 MW Daule Peripa hydro-electric project is being built by CEDEGE"&#13;
with a multipurpose reservoir; the powerhouse is in the initial stages of&#13;
construction. Commissioning is programmed for December 1998, but it is&#13;
unlikely to occur due to difficulties in obtaining financing from the Government.&#13;
(e)   the 230 MW San Francisco hydro-electric project located on the same&#13;
river as the Agoyan plant, to be commissioned in 1999. Like Agoyan, it&#13;
will be run-of-the-river and should have the same high plant factor.&#13;
7.    The power sector investment program designed by INECEL for the period 1993-&#13;
2000 amounts to about US$2 billion (an average of US$250 million per year), 58 percent&#13;
from INECEL and the remaining 42 percent from the distribution companies. The&#13;
program includes generation and transmission projects to be completed after 2000.&#13;
About 54 percent of the program is for generation, 17 percent for transmission and sub-&#13;
1     Comisi6n de Estudios para el Desarrollo del Guayas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
transmission, 21 percent for distribution and the remaining 8 percent for studies and&#13;
other investments. It reflects the current institutional framework of the sector, but it will&#13;
be modified according to the scope of the sector reform actually being pursued by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
Electricity ariff&#13;
8.    The Basic Electrification Law entitles INECEL's Board of Directors to approve&#13;
retail electricity prices.  The regulatory principle for setting electricity prices was&#13;
approved in 1983. In theory, its main objective is to set a price that provides the utilities&#13;
with an adequate contribution to investment. The price regulatory principle is based&#13;
entirely on accounting cost. In practice, the Government has never designed a price&#13;
policy consistent with these provisions and has restrained adjustments. Prices have been&#13;
based upon political considerations, and have been set at a level half that required for an&#13;
adequate financial rate of return on assets. Except for EMELEC, INECEL's distribution&#13;
subsidiaries should legally submit electricity price applications to the Board of Directors&#13;
of INECEL for consideration. In practice, this system is not followed; INECEL's board&#13;
sets a national electricity price upon the request of the Minister of Energy and Mines,&#13;
who normally would act with the approval of the President of the Republic.&#13;
9.    During the past decade, electricity            ELECTRCfTY RATEJ&#13;
prices have been decreasing, in real&#13;
terms, to an unacceptable level, as shown&#13;
in Figure 3. In 1991, the average price     .         . .     ..&#13;
charged to final customers was about 3.1   . .  . .&#13;
UScents/kWh, a 48 percent decrease from      . . .....&#13;
the 6 UScent/kWh reached in  1982. m&#13;
Prices were increased  monthly at 3&#13;
percent from  January 1989 to August           . . . . . . . . . .&#13;
1992, except residential and commercial&#13;
customers  consuming  less  than  200    oU N E        * 4    N   * * a so  n a &#13;
kWh/month, which were linked to the&#13;
increase in the minimum wage. Such low&#13;
prices led to INECEL's serious financial Figure 3&#13;
problems over the past decade (see para.&#13;
16).&#13;
10.   In October 1992, the new Government increased the average retail electricity&#13;
price by 90 percent and in June 1993 by an additional 35 percent. Currently, the average&#13;
electricity price (excluding 15 percent taxes for a rural electrification fund and&#13;
municipality fire protection) is equivalent to 6.6 UScent per kWh. This amounts to 88&#13;
percent of the expected long-range marginal cost. During the last decade, the difference&#13;
between actual tariffs and marginal cost has represented a loss of US$1.0 billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Currently, the average price varies from UScent 3.1 per kwh for residential customers&#13;
to UScent 7.2 kWh for industrial customers. This tariff level is not yet adequate and real&#13;
increases (above inflation) of 24 percent in 1993 and 27 percent in 1994 are necessary&#13;
to allow the sector to serve its financial requirements (para. 18).&#13;
11.   The present electricity price structure is inappropriate. Consumers are classified&#13;
according to their economic activities, while voltage levels, time of day, and load factors&#13;
are ignored. The price thus fails to send appropriate signals about cost of electricity and&#13;
penalizes (in relative terms) those consumers whose use patterns are better for the&#13;
system. A new methodology to set electricity prices following appropriate structure&#13;
patterns was developed with the assistance of consultants financed under Loan 2713-EC.&#13;
The final report, which is under review by INECEL's Board, defines the level and&#13;
structure of the electricity to be applied in the sector. The long-run marginal cost of&#13;
service at different system levels in UScent/kWh is as follows:&#13;
Generation                      4.6&#13;
Transmission                    5.5&#13;
Subtransmission (69 kV)         6.4&#13;
Distribution (34.5 and 13.8 kV)   6.8&#13;
Final low voltage consumer:     7.5&#13;
Performance of the Utilities&#13;
12.   INECEL's Organization and Management. INECEL faces internal administrative&#13;
problems. The organization is headed by a Board with the features of a Council of&#13;
Ministers. Decision-making tends to be slow and politically motivated. Furthermore,&#13;
the current electricity law vests much power in the Board and little in the managing&#13;
directors. Board meetings therefore tend to have an overcrowded agenda and little&#13;
efficiency, since many items are sent back to be analyzed by informal study groups.&#13;
Internally, INECEL lacks a management information system and has coordination&#13;
problems among its six Directorates. The Quito offices are spread over 13 different&#13;
locations, which has resulted in a duplication of administrative and financial staff, and&#13;
in a slow information flow.&#13;
13.    Control of Distribution companies. Distribution companies are not subject to&#13;
Central Government restrictions. INECEL's control of its subsidiaries is weak, because&#13;
the minority Board members appointed by regional organizations, unions, and local&#13;
municipalities often assert a disproportionate weight in decision making, sometimes&#13;
introducing political considerations. The largest distribution companies are EMELEC&#13;
with about 38 percent of the country's final sales, and Empresa Electrica de Quito (EEQ)&#13;
with about 26 percent. That leaves 17 distribution companies covering only 36 percent&#13;
of total sales. The volume of sales and number of customers of some distribution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
companies are thus limited and do not justify their existence. Reduction in their number&#13;
could improve efficiency, service quality, and costs.&#13;
14.   Staffing. The sector is overstaffed. In 1992, the labor productivity indicator&#13;
measured as the number of customers per employee ratio was 152. Despite the&#13;
significant improvement during the last decade (from 92 in 1980 to 152 in 1992), labor&#13;
productivity is still low compared to that of more efficient utilities in Latin American&#13;
countries (around 200). The sales per employee ratio has also increased, from 343 MWh&#13;
in 1980 to 517 MWh in 1992, but this is also lower than the average for the region (906&#13;
MWh). The sector has about 10,475 employees, of which 2,475 correspond to INECEL&#13;
and the remaining 8000 to the distribution companies. INECEL's staff composition also&#13;
reveals serious distortions as the ratio between administrative and technical staff is about&#13;
2:1, excluding unskilled workers, which is high for a power sector utility. INECEL's&#13;
authorities expect labor productivity to improve in the near future, as the Government&#13;
has frozen the hiring of new staff and INECEL is studying a program to provide cash&#13;
incentives for early retirement, but there is far less restraint on the growth of staff of the&#13;
distribution companies which has steadily increased during the past decade.&#13;
15.   Electricity Losses.  Losses have           POWER aECTO -E&#13;
steadily  increased  accruing  to  about             ENE3Y LOSSE&#13;
US$300 million over the decade (see    m_,&#13;
Figure 4). Currently, the total loss level&#13;
is 25 percent of net generation due to   .                  . .  . .. ...   l&#13;
high technical and non-technical losses.  of             ...               .. l&#13;
Distribution companies have on average        .        . .   ..      .. ..&#13;
losses of 21 percent. The high technical&#13;
losses in the distribution network result&#13;
from  inadequacies of old installations.    r    -      i    W-----&#13;
The high non-technical losses result from&#13;
illegal  consumption,  inefficient               EEI           z .&#13;
mechanisms for metering, and inadequate  Figure 4&#13;
commercial and customer-related&#13;
procedures.   Total losses could  be&#13;
reduced to 12.5 percent by 1996 if a distribution loss-reduction project, sponsored by&#13;
ESMAP is successful. The total cost of this project is estimated at US$106 million, and&#13;
would be partially financed by the Belgium Government (US$45 million) through the&#13;
Corporaci6n Andina de Fomento (CAF).&#13;
16.   Past Financial Performance. INECEL and its subsidiaries have faced serious&#13;
financial problems in the past decade. Due to insufficient electricity price increases, the&#13;
sector has been unable to produce a reasonable operating margin nor contribute to the&#13;
financing of its investment needs.   These problems became evident with the&#13;
Government's commitment to an ambitious investment program of hydro projects in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
early 1980s, and attempt to interconnect      rOURsAND PUCA   OF Fl&#13;
the country's regional systems into a     mu n&#13;
national power grid.  These programs    an&#13;
were mainly  funded with  petroleum      m i                 . .   ........ .&#13;
revenues  earmarked  for a  National    400 e              ......... .&#13;
Electrification  Fund  (NEF).    The&#13;
subsequent decline in oil prices, which&#13;
resulted in a reduction of NEF and&#13;
Govemment contributions, found  the   .        W   M _       "   M _   MD&#13;
sector ill-prepared  to  face  financial                  -&#13;
realities. Net cash generation has also   11- OEM                     - a u b. -M GM  o&#13;
become increasingly negative because of&#13;
low prices. Despite this, the financial&#13;
structure of the INECEL group is good, Figure 5&#13;
as capital contributions from the NEF and&#13;
government contributions have allowed it to limit reliance on borrowing as a source of&#13;
funding (see Figure 5). The INECEL group's debt/equity ratio was around 40/60&#13;
throughout the last decade. As of Dec. 31, 1992, INECEL's total debt was about&#13;
US$1.0 billion.&#13;
17.   The distribution utilities have a much smaller debt burden than INECEL.&#13;
However, if they have cash flow difficulties, they often fall behind on their payments to&#13;
INECEL for electricity. In the past, INECEL has reduced collectibles from the&#13;
distribution utilities through an accounting entry to increase its equity capital in the&#13;
utilities. As of June 1992, the distribution companies had arrears with INECEL&#13;
amounting to Sucres $103 billion (US$52 million).&#13;
18.   Future Financial Performance. The present level of the average electricity price&#13;
is still insufficient to cover the investment program. During the period 1992-1996,&#13;
INECEL's future financial performance could be only improved by raising electricity&#13;
prices. If the new electricity prices were maintained in real terms and borrowing were&#13;
to finance 50 percent of the investment, internal cash generation would be insufficient&#13;
to cover the balance for sector investments. Further price increases would be required&#13;
in 1993 (24 percent) and 1994 (27 percent) to eliminate government contributions. It is&#13;
estimated that INECEL's medium-term investment program would have to be reduced&#13;
from present plans due to financial constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
II. MAIN SECTORAL AND POLICY ISSUES&#13;
19.   The main issues of the power sector are: (a) a highly politicized approach to&#13;
electricity price policy; (b) inadequate financial resources to support investment; (c) lack&#13;
of independent roles of the State in the power sector as regulator and operator; and (d)&#13;
lack of autonomy and accountability of the power utilities.&#13;
Electricity Prices&#13;
20.   The Electricity Law provides for prices to be set according to accounting&#13;
principles, with an 8.5 percent return on revalued assets. Electricity prices are to be&#13;
equitable nationwide; however, they have typically been based on political considerations.&#13;
This system thus promotes inefficiencies. Although, electricity prices were sharply&#13;
increased by 90 percent in October 1992, and 35 percent in June 1993, they are still&#13;
below economic costs. This means INECEL will have to continue to rely on financial&#13;
support from Government if prices are not increased by 24 percent in 1993 and 27&#13;
percent in 1994.  Additionally, the price structure is inadequate, and residential&#13;
consumers have been strongly subsidized by other types of customers.&#13;
Finance&#13;
21.   During the last decade, the sector's finances deteriorated due to low electricity&#13;
prices that only covered sector operating and maintenance expenses. There is no external&#13;
financing available for capital expansion projects during 1992 and 1993. Moreover, the&#13;
Central Government's fiscal deficit severely limits Govemment financial support for new&#13;
projects. INECEL does not collect electricity bills from distribution companies. As a&#13;
result, reliability of electricity supply may deteriorate during the next five years and rural&#13;
electrification projects may be curtailed.&#13;
Legal and Regulatory Framework&#13;
22.   The existing legal and regulatory framework, the current organization of the&#13;
sector, and the state of the public utilities do not permit a rational improvement of the&#13;
efficiency of the sector without a serious and sustained effort towards substantial reforms.&#13;
Government intervention, political interference, and financial constraints have reduced&#13;
the efficiency and productivity of the sector. The overall efficiency of the power sector&#13;
is poor, characterized by INECEL's assumption of both regulatory and operational&#13;
activities, inadequate corporate autonomy, low efficiency of public utilities, and&#13;
inadequate pricing policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
23.   The current legal framework does not encourage private participation in the&#13;
sector.  Corporate public utilities created by INECEL are mostly owned by the&#13;
Government and are subject to the same monitoring and control system applied to public&#13;
entities. Additionally, there is no clear definition on the future operation of EMELEC,&#13;
whose concession expired in 1985. Private local and foreign investors are negotiating&#13;
the purchase of EMELEC's shares, but the Government has not yet defined under what&#13;
rules and conditions the concessions would be given to a new operator.&#13;
INECEL's Autonomy. Management, and Accountability&#13;
24.   INECEL is an integral part of the Central Government and fully subject to the&#13;
same bureaucratic controls and restrictions as ministries, the Central Bank, the Secretariat&#13;
of Development, the Office of the Controller General, and the General Procurement&#13;
Office. It results in inefficiencies, slow acquisition of required goods, and a tendency&#13;
to order more than required.  Although, INECEL's subsidiaries are structured as&#13;
corporations and are not subject to these controls, INECEL's control over subsidiary&#13;
operations carries little weight due to political conditions and lack of expertise of&#13;
INECEL's representatives on their board.&#13;
III. PROPOSED REFORMS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
25.   The Govemment's program to improve the efficiency and productivity of the&#13;
power sector includes: (a) separation of state regulatory and commercial functions,&#13;
concentrating on the regulatory function and gradually reducing its participation in&#13;
operational business; (b) restructuring INECEL and its distribution companies; (c) setting&#13;
prices based on economic cost; and (d) promoting the participation of private investors&#13;
in generation and distribution activities. The thrust of this program has been agreed upon&#13;
with Government as part of the preparation of a new electricity law, under the Bank&#13;
Loan 2713-EC. These main reform lines were agreed upon with the MEM, CONAM&#13;
and CONADE. Below are the basic principles of reform.&#13;
26.   The reform objectives are to promote secure, timely, efficient and low cost supply&#13;
of electricity, in particular to: (a) increase the efficiency of both private and public power&#13;
companies as well as ensure the financial autonomy of the latter; (b) reduce the direct&#13;
involvement of the Government in commercial power activities and increase the&#13;
participation of private investors; (c) establish a transparent, stable and efficient&#13;
procedure for regulating electricity prices within natural monopolies; and (d) protect the&#13;
environment in all power activities.&#13;
27.   The reform strategy consists of: (a) restructuring the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework for the electricity sector, including the establishment of a central regulatory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
agency, separating the Government's regulatory functions from its role as owner of&#13;
public utilities; (b) restructuring INECEL and its subsidiary distribution companies,&#13;
promoting decentralization and private participation; (c) establishing pricing policies and&#13;
procedures, free from political and other interferences, which would reflect the economic&#13;
cost of power production, transmission, distribution, and commercialization, and allowing&#13;
for the financial soundness of well-run utilities; (d) promoting energy conservation&#13;
through pricing and other measures; (e) revising the Electricity Law, so as to establish&#13;
a concession regime for the private sector with defined service responsibilities and&#13;
cancellation provisions in case of poor service or other violations of the laws and&#13;
regulations, and establish transparent, stable and efficient rules for the calculation of&#13;
electricity prices and their adjustment; (f) establishing appropriate regulations for&#13;
protecting the environment in all electricity-related activities.&#13;
Regulatory Framework&#13;
28.   The national Electricity Law requires modification. A draft new Electricity Law&#13;
has been prepared which redefines the role of the State in the power sector, clearly&#13;
separating its policy/regulatory role from its role as owner of power public utility.&#13;
29.   The draft Electricity Law supports the establishment of a regulatory agency aimed&#13;
at: (a) approving tariff increases; (b) establishing clear rules regarding the right of private&#13;
investors to obtain reasonable retums on their investments in the different sectoral&#13;
segments (generation, transmission, and distribution levels); (c) establishing rules for&#13;
price setting based on economic principles and clear mechanism for their adjustments;&#13;
and (d) setting standards for and controlling the quality of service and for accounting and&#13;
financial records of the utilities. The managing team will have a five year term&#13;
assignment and they would be ineligible for public elective functions for a period of time&#13;
after leaving the service. This agency should have strong power to supervise and&#13;
regulate the sector. This Bill was submitted to Congress in June 1994 on a regular&#13;
legislative basis. Congress' approval of the Bill is still pending.&#13;
Tariffs&#13;
30.   The proposed new Electricity Law modifies completely the existing tariff system&#13;
moving from accounting to economic principles. Generation will be on a competitive&#13;
basis and price of generated electricity will be set by market. Distribution companies and&#13;
large customers will be free to negotiate long term contracts with generators. A&#13;
secondary market coordinated by a National Dispatch Center will commercialize power&#13;
in the short term following principles of marginal cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
31.   Transmission charges will reflect average costs approved by the regulatory&#13;
agency. Access to the transmission system will be open to all generating and distribution&#13;
companies, as well as to any large customer willing to use the transmission network.&#13;
32.   Distribution companies will charge a tariff defined at the bidding process for&#13;
giving concession for services. Instead of existing accounting costs, tariff levels will be&#13;
based on estimated cost for a standard utility having adequate efficiency and service&#13;
quality.&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
33.   The proposed new structure of the power sector consists of the following:&#13;
(a)   Generation,  Competition is introduced in the generation of electricity.&#13;
No geographical concession area is defined for the generating companies.&#13;
AU new generating concessions will be decided on a competitive basis.&#13;
The distribution utilities will be free to contract power supply from the&#13;
generation utility that offers the lowest electricity price. The power plants&#13;
will be constructed and operated by private investors to sell energy to the&#13;
distribution companies on a competitive basis.&#13;
(b)   Transmission. The existing transmission system will be vested with a sole&#13;
company servicing all interconnected systems. This company will be&#13;
owned by investors without any ownership rights in the generating and&#13;
distribution companies to avoid hindering competition in the network. This&#13;
company will charge a transmission tariff based on average cost per kWh&#13;
transmitted in the system. It will allow free access to the system to all&#13;
users. It will be responsible for investments in the transmission system.&#13;
(c)   Distnrbution.  The distribution companies will operate in a partial&#13;
monopoly scheme, responsible for supplying energy in their concession&#13;
area. However, any large consumer will be allowed to contract energy&#13;
directly from the producers. and use the distribution system with due&#13;
payment for it.&#13;
(d)   National Dispatch Center (NDC). This center will define the economic&#13;
dispatch of power generation aiming at minimizing the production costs&#13;
and losses. The power market consists of: (a) a long-term market, in&#13;
which participate producers, distributors and large industrial customers&#13;
with negotiated contracts for supply of electricity; and (b) a short-term&#13;
market, in which distributors buy power or energy in a spot market, i.e.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
on an hourly or daily basis at a lower price than negotiated in the long-&#13;
term market.&#13;
Restructuring of INECEL&#13;
34.   In accordance with the institutional framework proposed in the draft Electricity&#13;
Law, INECEL will be restructured in smaller corporations. One transmission company,&#13;
several generating companies and several distribution companies will result from this&#13;
restructuring. The proposed law establishes a timetable for this restructuring to take&#13;
place (twelve months after approval of the law), as well as for selling majority of their&#13;
ownership to the private sector (30 months after approval).&#13;
Private Investors&#13;
35.   The Government plans to phase out its involvement in commercial activities in&#13;
the sector and promote the participation of private investors in the electricity business.&#13;
Doing so would alleviate sectoral competition for public funds. The proposed new&#13;
Electricity Law enables participation of private investors as independent generators for&#13;
implementing future thermal or hydro installations as well as distributors through&#13;
currently owned by INECEL or new ones.&#13;
Environment&#13;
36.   This project will finance technical assistance, and therefore, no direct&#13;
environmental effect will be created. However, in drafting the new institutional&#13;
framework for the sector and in the technical assistance for possible privatization of&#13;
assets, adequate environmental considerations and safeguards were taken. The proposed&#13;
new Electricity Law establishes as a condition for granting concessions the approval by&#13;
the Government of environmental studies to be submitted by future concessionaires. It&#13;
also establishes that the regulatory agency will have the authority to enforce all&#13;
environmental regulations to the power generating, transmission and distribution&#13;
companies. The technical assistance for privatizing the existing installations will also&#13;
include an environmental audit and the problems eventually found will have to be&#13;
addressed by the new owner as a condition of the bidding process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
IV. BANK'S ASSISTANCE TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED REFORMS&#13;
Actions&#13;
37.   The above reform program calls for the following actions:&#13;
(a)   contract technical-economic assistance required for:  (i) proposing a&#13;
regulatory structure; (ii) drafting a new electricity law; and (iii) drafting&#13;
an outline to restructure INECEL and its subsidiaries. Consultants were&#13;
engaged to carry out this technical assistance under loan 2713-EC and&#13;
services are concluded;&#13;
(b)   contract several individual consultants for preparation of: (i) general rules&#13;
for the electricity law and regulatory agency rules; and (ii) regulations on&#13;
tariffs, power system operation, quality of service standards, general&#13;
commercial procedures;&#13;
(c)   contract technical, financial and legal advisory assistance, specialized in&#13;
corporatization, investment and privatization business (investment bank),&#13;
to:&#13;
*     restructure INECEL in business units, separating generation,&#13;
transmission, and dispatch center activities, and merge existing&#13;
distribution companies in an adequate number of companies;&#13;
*     define the commercial value of the business units derived from&#13;
INECEL's distribution subsidiaries and propose an action plan to&#13;
sell INECEL's participation to private investors;&#13;
*     define the commercial value the business units resulting from the&#13;
existing generating plants and assist the Govemment in defining a&#13;
plan for their privatization;&#13;
*     execute the financial engineering of the process of privatization&#13;
and promote the business;&#13;
*     execute an environmental audit of the installations of the business&#13;
unit to be privatized; and&#13;
*     prepare the bidding documents for privatizing INECEL and assist&#13;
the Govemment in the entire process until the final agreement with&#13;
the new owner.&#13;
(d)   design a training program for govemment and power officials that would&#13;
be assigned regulatory responsibilities, through exposure to well&#13;
functioning regulatory agencies in other countries as well as through local&#13;
courses and seminars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Implementation Arrangement&#13;
38.   During appraisal it was agreed with the Government that the power component&#13;
of the Project will be implemented by an unit coordinated by a General Coordinator&#13;
assisted by three specialists: Legal, Technical and Financial. During negotiations, it was&#13;
agreed that the General Coordinator would coordinate both electricity and&#13;
telecommunication reform groups and that he would report to the President of CONAM.&#13;
Among other responsibilities the different sectors of the unit will be in charge of:&#13;
(a)   Iegal: Preparing all new legal documents and regulations, conforming the&#13;
legal documents and by-laws of the new enterprises resulting from&#13;
restructuring INECEL, and draft standard concession contracts;&#13;
(b)   Technical: Preparing the regulation for the operation of the National&#13;
Dispatch Center, regulation on tariffs, and regulation on standards of&#13;
quality of service;&#13;
(c)   Financia: Preparing the definition of the business units to be privatized,&#13;
dividing assets and personnel from INECEL to the new units, coordinating&#13;
the preparation of documents for privatization of the units.&#13;
Timetable&#13;
39.   The proposed timetable for this assistance is as follows:&#13;

PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
DETAILED SECTOR REFORMS AND ACTION PLAN FOR THE&#13;
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
Sector Organization&#13;
1.    Empresa Estatal de Telecomunicaciones (EMETEL) provides local, long distance&#13;
and international telephone and telex services to over 95 % of the subscribers.&#13;
Additionally, Empresa Publica Municipal de Telefonos, Agua Potable y Alcantarillado&#13;
(ETAPA), a corporation owned by the municipality of Cuenca, provides local telephone&#13;
services in the city of Cuenca. Law 184 of August 10, 1992 separated the former&#13;
Instituto Ecuatoriano de Telecomunicaciones (IETEL) into two entities: the operating&#13;
functions were delegated to EMETEL, and the overall Sector supervision and control&#13;
functions, including responsibility for allocation and control of the radio frequency&#13;
spectrum, were assigned to the Superintendency of Telecommunications. Law 184 gave&#13;
the Superintendency IETEL's frequency spectrum staff. However, it still has to recruit&#13;
and train qualified staff to perform its new functions. Since Law 184 does not specify&#13;
whether the Superintendency reports to the Executive or to the Legislative branch, this&#13;
has created a vacuum of accountability, and the Government has had difficulty exercising&#13;
its policy decisions. In addition to the public switched network, there are several&#13;
dedicated private networks to meet the specialized requirements of private companies,&#13;
public sector entitles in the petroleum and energy sectors, and the Armed Forces.&#13;
Ecuador has no telecommunications manufacturing industry as such, although some&#13;
ancillary equipment, such as small diameter subscriber cables, are produced locally.&#13;
Access to Service"&#13;
2.    With 550,000 direct exchange lines (DELs) in service, the average telephone&#13;
density in Ecuador, is 4.9 direct exchange lines (DELs) per 100 inhabitants. This&#13;
compares unfavorably with the averages for other Latin American countries (Colombia&#13;
7.4, Venezuela 8.5) and to the average for Latin America as a whole (7 DELs per 100&#13;
inhabitants). About 98% of all telephone lines are concentrated in urban areas. Quito&#13;
and Guayaquil, with 28% of the country's population, had 77% of the DELs. Rural&#13;
1.    Data as of December 31, 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
areas, with about 40% of the population, have only public call offices (PCOs) or no&#13;
service. Nearly all DELs are served by automatic exchanges, with only 90 lines, in the&#13;
rural areas, served from small manual exchanges. There are about 1,000 coin box&#13;
telephones and public call offices. Automatic telex service is available to about 3,404&#13;
subscribers of whom about 88% were in Quito and Guayaquil.&#13;
Usage of Service&#13;
3.    Current statistics do not distinguish between residential and business telephones,&#13;
nor is there data on the composition of traffic. However, since domestic call prices were&#13;
unchanged for 30 years until 1989, the revenue from domestic (local and long distance)&#13;
calls per DEL is a good indicator of the usage per line. International traffic has grown&#13;
steadily in the past years, and it grew 22% in each of the years 1991 and 1992, while&#13;
national traffic grew at a rate of 9% in the same period.&#13;
Existing Facilities and Quality of Service&#13;
4.    At end 1993, total telephone switching capacity was 912,000 lines and telex&#13;
exchange capacity 7,380 lines. (This includes 30,000 lines of telephone switching&#13;
capacity provided by ETAPA in Cuenca). Despite a large unmet demand, only about&#13;
63 % of the telephone exchange capacity is presently used. This is largely due to under-&#13;
utilization of capacity of recently commissioned exchanges which have been placed in&#13;
service ahead of expansion of the outside plant necessary to connect it to subscribers.&#13;
5.    The quality of service is poor with many outages and long delays in restoration.&#13;
Only 50% of faults are cleared within three days. Call completion rate is low averaging&#13;
only 35 %. There is also severe congestion on many inter-urban routes during business&#13;
hours when the call completion rate is practically zero. The poor quality of service is&#13;
primarily due to (a) delayed rehabilitation and replacement of faulty or unserviceable&#13;
equipment and cables: (b) equipment imbalance resulting from faulty planning and&#13;
delayed investment: and (c) poor maintenance. About 20% of the exchange equipment&#13;
needs replacement. Most of these old and obsolete exchanges are situated in the business&#13;
areas and serve heavy traffic-generating subscribers. Equipment regrading is overdue&#13;
in many of the older electromechanical exchanges. Redimensioning of exchanges and&#13;
inter-exchange routes for efficient handling of traffic is also necessary. The cable&#13;
network requires replacement in particular sections as well as rejoining where use of&#13;
inadequate materials and improper splicing procedures has made the waterproofing&#13;
ineffective. This is a particular problem in Guayaquil, where there is a sharp increase&#13;
of cable faults during the rainy season. A recent survey of the Guayaquil network&#13;
indicated that 20% of the primary and 50% of the secondary cable network needs to be&#13;
replaced. This has affected service to about 50,000 subscribers. In addition, lack of free&#13;
cable pairs and poor operational practices have often resulted in bypass of the congested&#13;
secondary network and direct connection of the subscriber from primary cables. This,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
coupled with non-maintenance of updated cable records, has created problems in fault&#13;
clearance. A severe shortage of skilled maintenance engineers has further aggravated the&#13;
situation.&#13;
Demand for Service&#13;
6.    The available data on demand is limited as EMETEL does not maintain waiting&#13;
lists in areas where exchanges are saturated and in areas where there is currently no&#13;
service. Even where waiting lists are maintained, there is significant suppressed demand&#13;
as potential customers are discouraged from registering by the current long lead time in&#13;
obtaining connections. The historic growth rate in DELs over the period 1990-92 of&#13;
about 9% per annum is no indication as it reflects a supply constraint due to&#13;
underinvestment in the sector. On the basis of demographic and economic data,&#13;
EMETEL estimates the total demand (working lines and unmet demand) at end December&#13;
1992, to be 1,000,000. Demand is estimated to grow by 5% per annum over 1992-97.&#13;
EMETEL aims to meet 76% of demand by 1997 as against 47% at end 1992.&#13;
H. THE ENTITY&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
7.    EMETEL, is a government-owned corporation administered by a six-member&#13;
Board of Directors, whose chairman is the representative of the President of the Republic&#13;
(the Minister of Public Works and Transport). The other members are representatives&#13;
from:  the Armed Forces, the National Development Council (CONADE), the&#13;
Engineering Association the EMETEL Union, and the consumer associations (unfilled).&#13;
The Board establishes policy and approves tariff proposals, budgets and other major&#13;
decisions.  Tariffs approved by the Board are subsequently confirmed by the&#13;
Superintendent of Telecommunications. The Executive Committee is formed by four&#13;
members, and chaired by the Executive President of EMETEL. It supervises execution&#13;
of Board's decisions and approves procurement and other operational matters.&#13;
8.    The organization is divided into a Corporate Headquarters and two Regions with&#13;
regional headquarters in Quito and Guayaquil. In general, the Regions are autonomous&#13;
with respect to detailed engineering, operations and maintenance, training and personnel&#13;
and control their day-to-day operations within approved budget ceilings. Efforts have&#13;
recently been made to improve intra-regional coordination through changes in&#13;
organizational structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Staffing and Training&#13;
9.    As of December 31, 1993, EMETEL's staff totalled about 6,050.  While&#13;
EMETEL's staff ratio of 14 per 1,000 DEL's is reasonable, being only 2 times that of&#13;
telephone companies in developed countries, staff composition is not in line with the&#13;
requirements of the company. Technical staff (engineers, technicians, operators, and&#13;
linemen) constitute only 43% of total staff and is less than administrative staff.&#13;
Moreover this percentage has declined over the last 10 years while the percentage of&#13;
administrative and support staff has increased.&#13;
10.   Training of EMETEL staff is provided mainly through the regional training&#13;
centers at Quito and Guayaquil, recently combined under a training institute (INCAlTEL)&#13;
created by Law 184 under the Superintendency. Direcci6n Nacional de Personal&#13;
provides limited training in general and administrative subjects and some specialized&#13;
telecommunications training has been provided by equipment suppliers. Training in&#13;
EMETEL has been inadequate, and budget allocations for both external and internal&#13;
training have been underutilized. The national training unit at corporate staff headquarters&#13;
has not played an effective role in coordinating and planning training activities. Regional&#13;
training centers are poorly managed, available facilities are not well maintained, and&#13;
there is a severe shortage of qualified instructions. EMETEL has taken some measures&#13;
to overcome the deficiencies in the more critical areas. Phase 1 of a Swedish technical&#13;
assistance program provided training in maintenance of exchange equipment and some&#13;
initial assistance with outside plant maintenance. To supplement its own resources&#13;
EMETEL is using local private contractors to assist with network maintenance.&#13;
Billing and Collection&#13;
11.   EMETEL's billing is fully computerized but the Quito y Guayaquil systems are&#13;
not compatible. There are marked differences in performance between the Guayaquil and&#13;
Quito regions. While bills are issued on schedule in Quito, within 20 days of the end&#13;
of the billing period, there have been major delays in Guayaquil.&#13;
12.   Collection of accounts receivables needs to be improved in both regions, although&#13;
the problem is more acute in Guayaquil. EMETEL has been reluctant to enforce&#13;
disconnection policies in the case of state-owned enterprises and in the Guayaquil region&#13;
where there are major problems with billing. Measures are being taken to reduce&#13;
accounts receivable including revised arrangements for payment of Government bills,&#13;
follow up legal action and more vigorous application of disconnection procedures in&#13;
respect of overdue accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Accounting&#13;
13.   EMETEL's accounting systems placed heavy emphasis on cash budget and&#13;
revenues. Cash operating and capital expenditures were approved annually by the&#13;
Government and were used as a control tool by EMETEL' management. Commercial&#13;
accounts, however, were largely ignored and have been unreliable due to inconsistent&#13;
policies and lack of documentation and control. Over the last 6 years, the auditors found&#13;
that several accounting procedures were not in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
accounting principles, the most important being, presentation of revenues on a cash basis&#13;
and costs on an accrual basis, inconsistent depreciation of fixed assets and inappropriate&#13;
recording of some asset and income items resulting on balance in understatement of these&#13;
accounts. All these problems were addressed in the recent Coopers &amp; Lybrand study.&#13;
A new, commercially oriented accounting system has been installed, modern computers&#13;
are being procured, and software is being developed to enable EMETEL to keep their&#13;
accounts up to date and on commercial basis.&#13;
Audit&#13;
14.   EMETEL has been slow in finalizing accounts and having them audited. Also,&#13;
the Controller General's Office, which has responsibility for auditing state enterprises&#13;
has been very slow in hiring external auditors. This has further delayed availability of&#13;
audited accounts.&#13;
Sector Reforms&#13;
15.         The Government of Ecuador has concluded that efficient and high quality&#13;
telecommunication services are essential to the insertion of the country in a modern,&#13;
globalized, economy. The Reform Objective is to provide more and better quality&#13;
services to the customers at lower costs. It entails the following:&#13;
(a)   to improve the quantity of, quality of, and access to, telecommunications&#13;
services to business and residential customers through network expansion&#13;
and rehabilitation;&#13;
(b)   to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of both the existing public&#13;
operators and of new private operators;&#13;
(c)   to attract private investment to the Sector through a comprehensive&#13;
restructuring, opening of the market and tariff re-balancing;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
16.   The Reform Strategy consists of:&#13;
(a)   restructuring the Sector, by separating the regulatory and operating&#13;
functions, once combined in the state monopoly IETEL, assigning the&#13;
policy functions to CONATEL, the regulatory functions to Superinten-&#13;
dency of Telecommunications, and the operating functions to EMETEL&#13;
S.A. EMETEL S.A. will be divided into EMETEL Norte S.A. and&#13;
EMETEL Sur S.A.2'&#13;
(b)   strengthening the regulatory framework;&#13;
(c)   opening the telecommunications market to competition through multiple&#13;
operators and licensees in those segments that technology and market&#13;
conditions permit, and regulating those services that, for some time, will&#13;
continue to be provided by a single operator;&#13;
(d)   inviting private capital and management to participate in the two EMETEL&#13;
S.A.s and ETAPA through an open, transparent, and fair bidding process,&#13;
that specifies the quality of service and investment obligations of the&#13;
investors as well as their rights to tariff reviews;&#13;
17.   The Reform Implementation consists of the following Action Plan:&#13;
Restructuring of the Sector&#13;
(a)   Approval of a new telecommunications law, containing the Sector&#13;
restructuring principles and providing the legal framework for the reform&#13;
(a Telecommunications Bill was submitted to Congress on September 2,&#13;
1994);&#13;
(b)   Drafting of new regulations for the provision of different services;&#13;
Opening of the Market to Competition&#13;
(d)   Institutional strengthening of the policy and regulatory entities in the&#13;
Government;&#13;
(e)   Improvement of the radio spectrum monitoring, control and granting of&#13;
radio frequency licenses;&#13;
2.    The two new companies will provide service in Quito, the andean and&#13;
amazonia regions, and Guayaquil, the coast and Galapagos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(f)   Review of applications and granting of licenses to new telecommunications&#13;
operators;&#13;
Steps required for Private Sector Participation&#13;
(g)   Preparation of EMETEL financial information and audit;&#13;
(h)   Preparation of financial projections for the new entities --the September&#13;
1994 Telecommunications Bill envisages splitting EMETEL into two&#13;
companies-- for final distribution in the sale prospectus as well as&#13;
separation of financial accounts and inventories&#13;
(i)   Inventory of labor obligations of EMETEL;&#13;
(j)   Preparation of legal documents required in the privatization;&#13;
(k)   Selection of qualified operators through a pre-qualification process;&#13;
(1l)   Preparation of bidding documents, issue, reception, analysis of tenders&#13;
and recommendation to award;&#13;
(m)   Contract award, negotiation, and closing the transfer of assets to the new&#13;
companies.&#13;
(n)   The same activities (g) to (m) for ETAPA.&#13;
18.         The Government of Ecuador will engage technical assistance for carrying&#13;
out the activities indicated above. Detailed Action Plan consists of:&#13;
Supervised by the Government of Ecuador:&#13;
(a)   Strategic Plan. The Government of Ecuador already has: (i) assembled&#13;
a centrally managed, strong team of experts functioning under the&#13;
leadership and supervision of CONAM with a clear mandate for the&#13;
change (the "Privatization Team"); (ii) found the substantial financial&#13;
resources needed to conduct the necessary analysis, evaluation and&#13;
execution; (iii) established a reasonable timetable for the completion of the&#13;
project (as proposed in the table of page 36); and (iv) defined the specific&#13;
goals for restructuring. The Government now has to define (i) which&#13;
services will be offered in full competition, which would be subject to&#13;
limited competition (i.e. cellular) and what would be the exclusivity period&#13;
of those basic services under monopoly; (ii) what service growth and&#13;
service obligations are reasonable to impose on the new companies; (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
how much capital investment will be required; (iv) what form of&#13;
regulatory oversight is appropriate; and (v) what will be the tariff setting,&#13;
re-balancing and review mechanisms.&#13;
(b)   Telecommunications Law. A Bill to amend Law 184 to include the&#13;
major reforms in the Sector, specifically to allow private sector&#13;
participation in EMETEL, to reform the regulation and to specify the&#13;
tariff policy was sent to Congress on September 2, 1994. The new&#13;
Telecommunications Law will have to be enacted to permit&#13;
implementation of the strategic reform plan.&#13;
(c)   Regulations.  After the telecommunications law  is approved, the&#13;
Government will prepare, with the assistance of consultants, the new&#13;
regulations, for (i) basic telephone service; (ii) cellular services; (iii)&#13;
competitive services; and (iv) interconnection of operators.&#13;
(d)   New Licenses. The CONATEL/Superintendency will grant new licenses&#13;
to telephone operators and providers of competitive services. Technical&#13;
assistance will be required for the preparation of bid specifications, review&#13;
of tenders and negotiation of contracts.&#13;
Supervised by the Superintendency:&#13;
(e)   Institutional Strengthening. Technical assistance will be required to set&#13;
up, organize, train the regulatory agency and its personnel as well as to&#13;
promulgate the procedures for the regulatory body.&#13;
(f)   Radio Spectrum Management. Technical assistance will be required to&#13;
establish a data base of radio frequency licensees, monitor emissions,&#13;
control the spectrum and assign new frequencies. Microcomputers will be&#13;
required for the data base.&#13;
Supervised by CONAM and the Privatization Team:&#13;
(g)   Financial Information. Although EMETEL has recently improved its&#13;
financial and accounting systems, additional technical assistance will be&#13;
required to prepare the financial information in internationally accepted&#13;
(GAAP) format, for 1993 and 1994, and in the prospective buyers "due&#13;
diligence" of financial information. Financial information must be&#13;
prepared separately for each company as per EMETEL's split.&#13;
(h)   Financial Projections and separations of rmancial accounts and&#13;
inventories (according to EMETEL's separation in two distinct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
companies). Financial projections will be prepared for final distribution&#13;
in the prospectus. The consultants will also estimate the value of the&#13;
companies and set minimum price and terms on the basis of future cash&#13;
flows.&#13;
(i)   Labor Obligations. EMETEL has recently completed the inventory of&#13;
assets. The remaining task will be the inventory of its labor contracts and&#13;
obligations. Negotiation of new labor contracts may be required before&#13;
closing the transaction. EMETEL will not reduce the overall number of&#13;
staff. However, more technical and less administrative staff will be&#13;
required. The consultants will also determine the amount of re-training&#13;
and re-location of EMETEL staff.&#13;
(j)   Legal Documents. The preparation of legal documents includes, inter-&#13;
alia: (i) the concession contracts; (ii) sale contracts; (iii) new companies&#13;
bylaws; and (iv) employee stock option plans.&#13;
(k)   Pre-qualification.  The companies have to be marketed to potential&#13;
bidders, usually through an investment banker or other sales agent&#13;
contacting the potential foreign investors. The bid process must provide&#13;
adequate time for interested bidders to conduct a reasonable "due&#13;
diligence" investigation of the company and its potential market&#13;
opportunity. Similarly, the country needs a chance to perform a "due&#13;
diligence" of the potential bidders. This requires a system for pre-&#13;
qualifying serious bidders.&#13;
(1)   Bidding. The Government will prepare the bidding documents, with the&#13;
assistance of consultants. This documents will detail the rights and&#13;
obligations to be conveyed. It should detail the relevant content of&#13;
intended statutes which will impose the terms of the operating concession,&#13;
operating requirements and scope of regulatory oversight. It should specify&#13;
the criteria to evaluate competing bids. The GOE will issue the bidding&#13;
documents, answer bidders questions, receive offers and evaluate them to&#13;
determine the best offer.&#13;
(m)   Contracts. After award, the contracts will be negotiated and signed.&#13;
Transfer of the companies to the new owners will complete the operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Supervised by the Municipality of Azuay:&#13;
(n)   Privatization of ETAPA. Similar to activities described above (g) to (m)&#13;
for ETAPA.&#13;
19.         Timetable. The proposed timetable for the action plan is indicated in Page&#13;
36. It would take approximately one and a half year to prepare the companies for&#13;
privatization and bring them to the point of sale.&#13;
20.         Technical Assistance Costs. In Table 1, page 37, the costs for the&#13;
proposed technical assistance are summarized. They amount to the following:&#13;
Total Technical Assistance Cost:     US$5.64 million&#13;
PERTA Loan:                             4.36 million&#13;
Counterpart Funds:                      1.28 million&#13;
A preliminary breakdown of the activities is indicated in Table 1, page 37.&#13;

            Technical Assistance Loan Project (PERTAL)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The major objectives of the Public
            Enterprise Reform Technical Assistance Loan Project are to
            support the Government's current efforts to: 1) reduce
            electricity subsidies in a sustainable way; 2) reform the
            legal and regulatory framework for the electricity and
            telecommunications sectors so as to ensure a complete
            separation of state policy and regulatory functions from
            commercial activities; 3) establish and/or strengthen the
            institutions in charge of the policy and regulatory
            functions which remain with Government; and 4) modify the
            legal status of the two state enterprises INECEL and EMETEL
            to prepare them for commercially oriented activity through
            concessions possibly combined with sale of assets or shares.
            To meet these objectives, the project will provide the
            Government with technical assistance in the form of
            consulting services and training to prepare the necessary
            legal, regulatory, institutional and sectoral reforms in the
            electricity and telecommunications sectors; define reform
            implementation; and prepare the privatization of specific
            activities whenever feasible.
