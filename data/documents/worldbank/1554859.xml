Foreword&#13;
The explosion of international migration in the Middle East and&#13;
North Africa. Region in the 1970s was a major development on the international&#13;
economic scene with profound implications for both the labor-importing and the&#13;
labor-exporting countries. The World Bank undertook a research study on the&#13;
subject in 1978 under the leadership of Ismail Serageldin and his group of&#13;
committed colleagues in the Technical Assistance and Special Studies Division&#13;
of the EMENA Projects Department. The study was completed in 1981 and the&#13;
Report has been widely disseminated. It has been published in book form this&#13;
year. 1/&#13;
The set of simulation models developed by the Technical Assistance&#13;
and Special Studies Division and elaborated during the research project has&#13;
been applied to study manpower problems and planning issues in several&#13;
countries and proven to be a useful tool for manpower planning. The wide&#13;
availability and a full description of these models is important and to be&#13;
welcomed.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This document, published in four volumes as part of the World Bank's&#13;
staff working papers, is intended to set forth the mathematical formulation of&#13;
the Bank's various Manpower Planning Models, most of which have now been used&#13;
in a number of countries and studies, but whose technical documentation was&#13;
not hitherto available to the public.&#13;
Applied Models are living entities, constantly changing and (we hope)&#13;
improving to meet the new requirements introduced by their users. The present&#13;
publication must therefore be seen as a snapshot in time, but one which&#13;
presents the interested user with the opportunity of reviewing the technical&#13;
documentation as well as the user's guides as they stand at the beginning of&#13;
1983. They are not likely to change significantly until a new round of&#13;
intensive applications produces a new generation.&#13;
The technical presentation provides, for completeness, a detailed&#13;
discussion (pp. 98-132) of a simultaneous procedure method for the migration&#13;
model. This has not been implemented to date, partly because time and&#13;
resources constraints prevented its complete development and elaboration, but&#13;
it nevertheless sketches out the likely direction of our next round of&#13;
research and development efforts, planned for 1983/84.&#13;
It is important to emphasize, however, that while we were the main&#13;
protagonists in the development of these models, the work would not have been&#13;
possible without the support, guidance and incisive comments of many&#13;
colleagues in and outside the Bank. To all of them we owe a great debt of&#13;
intellectual and moral gratitude. We emphasize, however,-that any errors or&#13;
shortcomings in the present manuscript are purely our own.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Among those in the Bank who provided constant support and&#13;
encouragement during the six year life of these manpower planning efforts, of&#13;
which this document is just a small part, we must thank in particular&#13;
Mr. Vinod Dubey, Chief Economist of the EMENA region, whose constant personal&#13;
and technical support from the earliest days to the present have made this task&#13;
possible. The long-term study efforts have also benefitted from the strong&#13;
support of Messrs. R. Chaufournier, Vice-President of EMENA; and M.P. Benjenk,&#13;
currently Vice-President, External Relations and formerly Vice-President of&#13;
EMENA; and Messrs. A. David Knox, currently Vice-President for West Africa&#13;
(formerly Projects Director, EMENA); A. Karaosmanoglu, currently Vice-President&#13;
for East Asia and Pacific (formerly Director of Programs, EMENA), and M.P. Bart,&#13;
Director of Programs, EMENA; and A.S. El Darwish, Director of Projects, West&#13;
Africa (formerly Assistant Director of Projects, EMENA); and especially&#13;
Messrs. R. Picciotto, Director of Projects, EMENA; and J.J. Stewart, Assistant&#13;
Director of Projects, EMENA. A special mention is also needed of the support&#13;
given by Mr. D. Avramovic when he was Director-of the Bank's Development&#13;
Economics Department, and Mr. S. Acharya when he was Research Advisor.&#13;
Many colleagues from the Bank have contributed valuable comments and&#13;
insights to the general studies of which these Models were the central part,&#13;
among these we must name S. Birks, C. Blitzer, F. Colaco, Z. Ecevit, I. Hume,&#13;
J.P. Jallade, T. King, G. Pennisi, R. Prosser, N. Sherbiny, C. Sinclair,&#13;
J. Socknat, and M. Wilson. The computer related work was ably done by Peter&#13;
and Tom Wolfe (Consultants). Earlier versions were programmed by A. McClinton&#13;
of the Phoenix Corporation. Applications on various countries were undertaken&#13;
with the support of G. Cima, B. Krishna, B. Smith, H. Pemniarazu, M. Youssef,&#13;
and M. Allak.&#13;

Note&#13;
The purpose of this User's Guide for the Regional (Expanded) Model&#13;
is to describe the input, output, use, and operation of the Regional&#13;
(Expanded) Model, a manpower forecasting model, implemented for IBM 370&#13;
systems.&#13;
Staff of the Technical Assistance and Special Studies (TASS)&#13;
Division of the World Bank are available, under appropriate arrangements, to&#13;
discuss with potential users the collection and preparation of required input&#13;
data for running the Model. In some cases, the TASS Division can also conduct&#13;
short orientation and training sessions on the capabilities and operation of&#13;
the Model.&#13;

Section 1.0 Introduction&#13;
The purpose of this interim User's Guide is to provide information&#13;
to users of the Regional Manpower Planning Model (The Expanded Model) on the&#13;
features and design of the Expanded Model, on what reports/outputs are avail-&#13;
able and on how to prepare input data, when available, for regional manpower&#13;
forecasting and analysis.&#13;
The detailed discussions of the Expanded Model are given in&#13;
the Discussion Paper # 1, An Expanded Manpower Planning Model for Regional&#13;
Manpower Analyses Internal Specifications, Dated January 16, 1978. In the&#13;
original Compound Model, a country is treated as a single unit, in which&#13;
estimated manpower stocks, requirements and supplies, though disaggregated&#13;
by sector/occupation matrices and by nationality, do not have any breakdown&#13;
by geographic regions. The emphasis of the original Compound Model is on&#13;
stock analysis. But the Expanded Model will include both regional and national&#13;
manpower analyses including but not limited to inter-regional labor force&#13;
migration, and the associated movement of non-labor force due to labor force&#13;
migration. The Expanded Model emphasizes both stock analyses and flow&#13;
analyses at both national and subnationl (regional) levels.&#13;
The reports and outputs to be produced by the Expanded Model are&#13;
discussed in detail in Section 3.0 System Outputs.    The users of the Expanded&#13;
Model have options to select one or more or all of the reports at the selected&#13;
years of projections. It is not intended to have all the available reports&#13;
analyzed by one individual. On the contrary, it is recommended that a team of&#13;
specialists be assembled, and each of them analyzes reports produced in their&#13;
field of expertise. Tnrough this team effort, various sensitivity analyses&#13;
should then be conducted and analyzed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Among the reports described in Section 3.0, the following Ymeports&#13;
are of particular interest for flow analyses at both the national and the&#13;
subnational levels:&#13;
(1) National Labor Force Stock by Sector and Occupation&#13;
(Report ID LOI), by Occupation and by Year (Report ID L02)&#13;
and by Sector and by Year (Report ID L03), which give ana-&#13;
lyses, inter alia, on the leakage of nationals during a&#13;
given year and labor force movements through the gain from,&#13;
or the loss due to, reallocation of leaked national&#13;
labor force;&#13;
(2) Population ReDorts (Report ID S05 and Report ID S06),&#13;
which summarize the population by locality, age group,&#13;
sex, nationality as well as estimated flows on move-&#13;
ins, move-outs, death and birth;&#13;
(3) Available Manpower Pool Analyses (Report ID P08), and&#13;
Regional Manpower Leakage Analyses (Report ID P09), which&#13;
provide information, inter alia, on labor force waiting&#13;
in transient state, the number of total leakers avail-&#13;
able for reallocation as well as the number of leakers&#13;
distributed to each region in the country.&#13;
(4)  Highlight Reports including Labor Force Highlight Report&#13;
(Report ID H01), Manpower Surplus/Shortage Report (Report&#13;
ID H02), and Additional Achievable Outputs Due to Labor&#13;
Force in Transient State (Report ID H03), which provide&#13;
information on surplus/deficit manpower, and additional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
achieveable outputs that are obtainable if those labor&#13;
force in transient state are allocated for productive&#13;
uses.&#13;
Past experience in the uses of the Compound Model indicate that the&#13;
initial data preparation is the most time consuming part of the exercise.&#13;
This could also be true for the uses of the Expanded Model. Many different&#13;
types of expertise are required to analyze what data are available, how to&#13;
classify sector/occupation categories, how to construct the'education training&#13;
system, and how to prepare various input parameters that are required for the&#13;
uses of the Compound Model or the Expanded Model. But this is not the unique&#13;
problem to the Compound Model or the Expanded Model only; it is a common&#13;
symptom for the uses of all models, regardless of the scale of the models.&#13;
However, once the base case data are collected, and analyzed, sensitivity&#13;
analysis can be easily done by changing only the data that are affected. It&#13;
is through sensitivity analyses that the users of the Expanded Model should&#13;
try to derive their policy recommendations and the potential consequences of&#13;
the recommended policy choices.&#13;
This interim User's Guide is prepared primarily for the users of the&#13;
Expanded Model to start collecting data and when available, put in key punch&#13;
forms as described in Appendix A Card Formats. A finalized version of User's&#13;
Guide is being prepared to replace this interim User's Guide. Any question&#13;
regarding data preparation for the Expanded Model should be addressed to:&#13;

Section 2.0 Overview&#13;
2.1 General Description of the Model Designs&#13;
The system is divided into 3 modules, according to their function,&#13;
as shown in Figure 2.1. The first module is the edit module which checks all&#13;
of the data for errors and generates an optional listing for the user of the&#13;
input deck. The input cards are described in general in Section 4.0 and in&#13;
detail in Appendix A.&#13;
The second module is the simulation module where the input data&#13;
is actually used to calculate manpower projections. The model contains&#13;
several submodels. These submodels are:&#13;
(i) Labor Force Model;&#13;
(ii)  Manpower Requirement Model;&#13;
(iii)  Educational Simulation Model (ESM); and&#13;
(iv)  Manpower Policy Model.&#13;
The Labor Force Model maintains the national and expatriate labor&#13;
force for each locality on an annual basis. Starting from base year informa-&#13;
tion, the model applies an annual attrition rate to expatriates and attrition&#13;
as well as leakage rates to nationals. The ltaked national labor force is&#13;
then re-allocated among localities within the country. The Labor Force Model&#13;
also accounts for the move-ins, move-outs and supplies from available labor&#13;
force.&#13;
The Manpower Requirements Model calculates the total manpower&#13;
requirements by sector/occupational categories to achieve the desired tar-&#13;
get outputs. It also calculates the net manpower requirements by sector/&#13;
occupational categories after comparing the total manpower and the available&#13;
&#13;

manpower stock. There is a capability to directly input manpower requirements&#13;
for sectors which have readily available data. Also, teacher requirements may&#13;
be summed directly from the Educational Simulation Model (ESM).&#13;
The Education/Training Simulation Model (ESM) is based upon a sim-&#13;
plified version of a model developed by UN'ESCO. It has specific new capabili-&#13;
ties to meet the need of the Expanded Model's objectives, including the&#13;
abilities to:&#13;
(i) Forecast school leavers by age and by educational level;&#13;
(ii)  Forecast number of school leavers who will participate&#13;
in the labor force; and&#13;
(iii) Maintain pools of those who are below the legal minimum&#13;
age to participate in the labor force.&#13;
The Manpower Policy Model (MPM) compares the net manpower require-&#13;
ments against manpower supplies from the educational systems, and attempts to&#13;
allocate them in accordance with a priority matrix, in which the priority&#13;
and proportion of nationalization in each sector/occupation are specified by&#13;
policy makers. In addition, MPM also estimates global achievable output,&#13;
labor force in transient state, net requirements for expatriates and surplus/&#13;
deficient national manpower in each locality.&#13;
The final module is the reports module. It takes the outputs of the&#13;
various submodels of the simulation module and generates the reports described&#13;
in Section 3.0. Consolidation reports for the country as a whole are also&#13;
generated by the report module.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
Together, these four submode.ls perform simulation runs for the fol-&#13;
lowing functions:&#13;
1.   Estimate labor force inventories and leakages;&#13;
2.   Estimate labor force requirements;&#13;
3.   Estimate manpower supplies from education/training systems;&#13;
4.   Perform labor force supply poolings;&#13;
5.   Perform manpower allocation of current year school leavers&#13;
according to poolings;&#13;
6.   Re-allocate labor force leakages to localities with time&#13;
lags taken into account;&#13;
7.   Estimate non-labor force movements due to labor force&#13;
movements with time lags taken into account;&#13;
8.   Calculate local net manpower requirements;&#13;
9.   Calculate local achievable outputs;&#13;
10.   Calculate national net manpower requirements;&#13;
11.   Calculate national achievable outputs;&#13;
12.   Estimate net importation/exportation of expatriates at both&#13;
the local and the national levels.&#13;
2.2 Input Capability Improvements over the Original Compound Model&#13;
In addition to the major capabilities of the Expanded Model for&#13;
stock and flow analyses on labor force and non-labor force movements as des-&#13;
cribed above, there are several improvements in input capabilities relative to&#13;
those of the original Compound Model. These improvements are described in the&#13;
remainder of this section:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
(1) In the original Education/Training Submodel a limitation of not&#13;
more than 12 follow-on courses was imposed. This limitation has&#13;
now been removed. In the Expanded Model, there is no limitations&#13;
on the number of follow-on courses.&#13;
(2) The D cards have been substantially revised. The streaming cards&#13;
can now be used jointly to specify interpolation points and a&#13;
number of interpolation intervals rather than a single one (i.e.&#13;
only the first year and the last year of simulation run). In&#13;
addition, growth rates can also be applied after the interpola-&#13;
tion intervals rather than for the entire range of years. Thus,&#13;
a combination of direct entry, interpolation, and growth rates&#13;
can be used for a single sector.&#13;
(3)  New options have been made available on E06 Card (PRDD and&#13;
Repetition/Dropout Data Card). These options are:&#13;
(i) If 0 or blank, then both Repetition/Dropout rates and&#13;
PRDD's are present;&#13;
(ii)  If 1, then only the Repetition/Dropout rates are present;&#13;
(iii)  If 2, then only PRDD's are present; and&#13;
(iv)  If 3, then the Repetition/Dropout and PRDD values&#13;
are to be added to last year's values to obtain&#13;
new Repetition/Dropout rates and PRDD's.&#13;
(4) Labor pools are now identified by a 3-character alpha-numeric&#13;
code rather than a number. This provides greater flexibility&#13;
and allows the use of the "ALL" option on some cards to specify&#13;
all labor pools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(5) An option to allow users of the Expanded Model to group certain&#13;
sectors together for the highlights reports has been introduced&#13;
using GIO card. In the original Compound Model, this sector&#13;
grouping for the highlights reports could not be defined by&#13;
users.&#13;
(6) To make the Expanded Model as general purpose a model as pos-&#13;
sible, the users of the Expanded Model can now specify in the&#13;
COI card the ID of the nationals so the users have complete&#13;
flexibility in assigning IDs to the nationalities on the G04&#13;
cards.&#13;
(7) Several options have been introduced into the Expanded Model to&#13;
provide the users increased flexibility in specifying the method&#13;
whereby expatriates are assigned to unfilled positions. These&#13;
include (i) current proportions of expatriates are continued in&#13;
each sector/occupation, (ii) user-supplied new proportions are&#13;
to be maintained after importation or exportation of required&#13;
expatriates to fill in shortages, and (iii) user-supplied propor-&#13;
tions are to be applied to unfilled expatriate positions. The&#13;
technique employed can vary between sector/occupation combina-&#13;
tions and simulation years.&#13;
(8) The Edit Module for the Expanded Model has been improved to pro-&#13;
vide more complete checking of input data than was done for the&#13;
original Compound Model. Error messages are more specific and&#13;
fields in error are underlined. A listing of error diagnostics&#13;
can be found in Appendix C.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Section 3.0 System Outputs&#13;
The model will generate four major outputs which are briefly de-&#13;
scribed in this section.&#13;
The outputs are:&#13;
(1) Reports;&#13;
(2) Master File (output from Edit step);&#13;
(3) Expanded Model Output File; and&#13;
(4) Diagnostic Output.&#13;
The contents of reports generated by the Expanded Model are&#13;
described in the remainder of this section. The master file generated by&#13;
the Edit Module and the Expanded Model output file generated by the Edit&#13;
Module and the Simulation Module are described in the manual Programming&#13;
Documentation, to be issued separately. The diagnostic outputs which&#13;
describe errors committed in input preparations are in Appendix C.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.1 Reports&#13;
This secti.,n describes each of the reports in the Expanded Model&#13;
system. Sample reports can be found in Appendix B. It is recommended that&#13;
Users of the Expanded Model refer to those sample reports while studying this&#13;
section.&#13;
The reports are labeled with a 3-letter code (e.g., MOI, M02, etc.)&#13;
beginning with a letter which identifies the type of report. The years to be&#13;
included in the reports as well as the report ID's can be separately selected&#13;
for each locality and for the global output. The reports are selected using&#13;
the G05 card, with the years being specified on the C03 card.&#13;
The reports can be divided into five major categories:&#13;
(i) Labor Force Status Reports;&#13;
(ii) Manpower Requirements Reports;&#13;
(iii) Education/Training and Manpower Supply Reports;&#13;
(iv) Manpower Policy Implications Reports; and&#13;
(v)  Highlights Reports.&#13;
The first four major categories correspond to the four major submodels of&#13;
the Compound Model.&#13;
Labor Force Status Reports include:&#13;
(LOI)     National Labor Force Stock by Sector and by Occupation&#13;
(Report ID L01)&#13;
For each selected year, this report gives an overall view&#13;
of the national labor force stock by sector and by occupation.&#13;
It contains the following items:&#13;
A. The existing national labor force at the&#13;
beginning of a year;&#13;
B. The attrition during the year;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
C. The leakage of nationals during the year;&#13;
D.  The available labor force after attrition and&#13;
leakage;&#13;
E. Current year allocation of school leavers;&#13;
F. Labor gained from reallocation of leakage; and&#13;
G. Total labor available at the end of the year.&#13;
(L02)     National Labor Force Stock by Occupation and by Year&#13;
(Report ID L02)&#13;
This report gives the same information as Report LOI except&#13;
that the information is summed across sectors.    All selected&#13;
report years are combined into a single table.&#13;
(L03)     National Labor Force Stock by Sector and by Year&#13;
(Report ID L03)&#13;
This report gives the same information as Report LOI except&#13;
that the information is summed across occupations. All&#13;
selected report years are combined into a single table.&#13;
(NOl)     Ex-patriate Labor Force Analvses by lUationalitv. bv Sector,&#13;
by OccuDation (Report ID NOl)&#13;
For each selected year this report gives expatriate labor&#13;
force stock by sector and by occupation, for each expatr:i .:&#13;

Section 4.0 System Inputs&#13;
The input to the system consists of a card deck and optionally a&#13;
master file. This section will describe:&#13;
(1) How a master file is used as part of the input;&#13;
(2) What data are required.&#13;
Since the master file is in the same format as the data cards this&#13;
section will first describe the general card format to be used. Secondly, the&#13;
master file will be described including the rules for updating. The remainder&#13;
of the section will describe the cards needed for the various sections of the&#13;
model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
4.1 General Card Format&#13;
Although the data items vary for each card type, the first ten&#13;
columns are similar. This field is reserved to contain system identification&#13;
information as described below:&#13;
Card Column                              Description&#13;
1                         Card type identifier which identifies the submodel&#13;
or type of data being entered.&#13;
2 - 3                     Remainder of the card type identifier.    These are&#13;
numeric digits (e.g., "02").&#13;
4 - 6                     Locality identification field.   These 3 characters&#13;
are available to the user to identify the locality&#13;
associated with the data. The following codes can&#13;
be entered:&#13;
ID - three-character locality identifier (defined&#13;
on a GOB card).&#13;
"GLB" - global data&#13;
"ALL" - data applies to all localities (and global&#13;
if appropriate) which do not otherwise appear&#13;
in the input with the same card type in&#13;
columns 1-3. (Thus "ALL" may be used to enter&#13;
data for some or all localities.)&#13;
7 -10                     Sequence number field which is used to generate&#13;
the desired order of input of cards of the same&#13;
type. It is also used in the updating procedure&#13;
described in Section 4.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
4.2 Master File&#13;
The master file is used to allow the user to submit smaller input&#13;
decks. This section will describe the use of the file on input.&#13;
In either Update ("U") or Sensitivity ("S") runs the edit program&#13;
will first merge the entire input data deck with the input data stored in the&#13;
master file specified on the input card. This merge procedure will make use&#13;
of the card ID (Col 1-3), locality identifier (Col 4-6), and the card sequence&#13;
number (Col 7-10).&#13;
The main features of the updating are shown in the table below:&#13;
Feature                               Description of Row to Use&#13;
REPLACE                      Duplicate card ID, locality identifier, and card&#13;
sequence number of card to be replaced.&#13;
INSERT                       Use card sequence number not in master file.&#13;
This number may be duplicated in the input deck&#13;
if more than one card is to be inserted.&#13;
DELETE                       Duplicate card ID, locality identifier and card&#13;
sequence number of card to be deleted. Place&#13;
DELETE in Col 11-16.&#13;
DELETE A GROUP (ALL          Duplicate card ID, locality identifier and card&#13;
SAME ID AND LOCALITY)        sequence number of first card to be deleted.&#13;
Place DELETE in Col 11-16, add last sequence in&#13;
Column 17-20. The last sequence need not appear&#13;
on any card of the master file.&#13;
In the event that a new master file is written, the output will&#13;
be resequenced starting at 0001 and incrementing by 2 for each card type and&#13;
locality. A listing will be generated at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Figure 4.1 illustrates part of an update run. Only the card ID,&#13;
locality ID (R04) and sequence numbers are listed. The left-most column con-&#13;
tains a section of the original master file, the next column contains the&#13;
input update cards, next is the resultant update and then is shown a resequenced&#13;
version of the updated information: the new master file. The right-most column&#13;
contains a description of the updating operations.&#13;

The C01 card allows users to define a base year and to select any&#13;
number of simulation years desired. It also contains a flag indicating if a&#13;
new master file is desired.&#13;
Tne C02 card set allows users to enter any description about the&#13;
simulation run being requested. The description contained in the first card&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
will be printed at the top of each page of the reports generated by the system.&#13;
Any additional carl, are printed at the beginning of the reports. Although&#13;
not required it is strongly recommended that a complete description of the&#13;
run be made by the user. Each locality can have its own C02 card set.&#13;
The C03 card is entered for each locality and used to define the&#13;
years of reports.&#13;
The GOI cards allow users to identify themselves on the simulation&#13;
output. There could be as many of these cards as the ntumber of people in-&#13;
volved in the analyses. If these cards are present, the information provided&#13;
will be printed on the output reports.&#13;
The G02 set of cards allows users to define sector ID's and descrip-&#13;
tions. The sector ID's provided in this set of cards must be used consistently&#13;
throughout the simulation run and will constitute a dictionary. The ID's&#13;
entered could be alpha-numeric combinations. This set of cards is required.&#13;
The G03 set of cards allows users to define occupation ID's and&#13;
descriptions in a manner consistent with the sector definition cards. The&#13;
occupation ID's must be consistent throughout the simulation run. This set&#13;
of cards is required.&#13;
The G04 set of cards allows users to define nationality ID's and&#13;
descriptions in a manner consistent with the sector definition card. The&#13;
nationality ID's must be consistent throughout a given simulation run. One&#13;
set of cards is required for each simulation run.&#13;
The G05 cards allows users to select reports provided by the sys-&#13;
tem. The user may select different reports from each of the localities as&#13;
well as global reports. The user can:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(1) Identify the reports desired;&#13;
(2) Identify the reports not wanted (remainder generated);&#13;
(3) Specify that "ALL" are wanted; or&#13;
(4) Specify that none are wanted.&#13;
If this card is not entered reports can later be selected with a report phase&#13;
control card.&#13;
The G06 set of cards allows users to specify the distribution list&#13;
of reports selected, number of copies to be distributed for each recipient,&#13;
etc. The information provided on this card will be printed on reports&#13;
produced by the system. This card is optional.&#13;
The G07 set of cards allows users to attach footnotes to selected&#13;
reports. A footnote may be continued on a second card by duplicating the&#13;
report ID and the footnote number. The footnotes will be printed in the order&#13;
that they are found in the input deck. The footnote will only apply to&#13;
reports from the locality. If the footnote is desired to appear on a specific&#13;
report from more than one locality, it must be entered for all of the desired&#13;
localities or using "ALL" as the locality designator if it is to be printed&#13;
for all localities.&#13;
The G08 set of cards allows users to define locality ID's and&#13;
descriptions in a manner consistent with the sector definition card. One set&#13;
of G08 cards is required for each simulation run.&#13;
The G09 set of cards allows users to define pool ID's and descrip-&#13;
tions in a manner consistent with the sector definition cards. One set of G09&#13;
cards is required for each simulation run.&#13;
The GIO set of cards allows users to define a sector grouping to be&#13;
used in the HOI report. This set of cards is optional; if the cards are not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
used then the sector grouping portion of the HOI report will not be printed&#13;
if the HOl report is selected.&#13;
4.3.2      Labor Force Input&#13;
This input is used to define the labor force in the locality. It&#13;
allows users to enter:&#13;
(1) The base year labor force;&#13;
(2) Attrition rates;&#13;
(3) Leakage rates for nationals.&#13;
The labor force input is briefly described below:&#13;

L05             Leakage rates - Nationals                    1 set per locality&#13;
The LO1 set of cards allows users to provide data on the existing&#13;
national labor force by sector and occupation in the base year. The&#13;
sector/occupation ID's entered on this card or set of cards must have been&#13;
defined in card G02 and card G03. Any cells not filled are assumed to con-&#13;
tain no national workers in the base year. This card set is required for&#13;
each locality in the simulation run.&#13;
The L02 set of cards allows users to specify attrition rates for&#13;
national labor force by year, by occupation/sector. In order to ease the&#13;
input preparation the keyword "ALL" may be used in either Sector or Occupation&#13;
ID field to identify a constant value across the sector or occupation ID field&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
to identify a constant value across the sector or occupation. Attrition rates&#13;
remain in effect until changed by a subsequent card. They are all initialized&#13;
to zero in the base year.&#13;
The L03 set of cards has a similar meaning as Card LOI, Base Year&#13;
National Labor Force Card, except that the nationality ID's must be entered&#13;
in this card. If this card is not used the base year expatriate labor counts&#13;
are zero.&#13;
The L04 set of cards has a similar meaning as Card L02, National&#13;
Labor Force Attrition Card, except that the nationality ID's must be entered&#13;
in this card. In the international case, attritional expatriates will be&#13;
returned to their home country without any time lag. "ALL" may be used as&#13;
a Sector, Occupation, or Nationality ID.&#13;
The L05 set of cards is used to identify nationals within the&#13;
locality that will leave the locality during the year. They are reassigned&#13;
to other localities using the Leakage Distribution Cards (P05) as well as the&#13;
time lag card (P04). This set of cards is similar to the L02 cards in that&#13;
entries are made for each Sector/Occupation. "ALL" has a similar meaning.&#13;
4.3.3     Manpower Requirements Input&#13;
The manpower requirement input allows users to calculate the pro-&#13;
jected required labor force at the sector-occupation level. This is done by&#13;
calculating the requirements at the sectoral level and then using distribution&#13;
rates to estimate the occupational distribution.&#13;
The user can enter data for any two of: sector product output;&#13;
sector productivity; sector employment. The third one is computed from the&#13;
two entered as data. The same two need not be entered for every sector. (If&#13;
all three are entered for a sector then the sector productivity entered as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
data is not used, but is checked to ensure that it is within 5% of the value&#13;
computed by dividing sector output by sector employment.)&#13;
Each of the three sector quantities can be specified directly on a&#13;
yearly basis, or growth rates can be specified to be,applied after a particu-&#13;
lar year.  In addition, if values are entered for two non-successive years&#13;
then the data for intermediate years will be computed by interpolation.&#13;
The occupation distribution rates may be entered on a yearly basis.&#13;
They may also be interpolated between values for non-successive years.&#13;
The manpower requirements cards are summarized in the table below:&#13;
Card ID                                      Description&#13;
D 2                               Base year sector product output&#13;
D03                               Sector product streaming (yearly)&#13;
D05                               Sector product output growth&#13;
D08                               Base year sector productivity&#13;
D09                               Sector productivity streaming (yearly)&#13;
Dll                               Sector productivity growth rate&#13;
D14                               Base year sectoral employment&#13;
D15                               Sectoral employment growth rate&#13;
D19                                Sectoral employment streaming (yearly)&#13;
D20                                Sectoral/occupation employment distribu-&#13;
tion rates&#13;
The D02 set of cards allows users to enter base year sectoral out-&#13;
put. The choice of units for use in sector output and sector productivity is&#13;
arbitrary but it is left to the user to make certain that consistent units&#13;
are used. Sector output divided by productivity should yield total manpower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Tne D03 card can be used to enter sector product output for years&#13;
after the base year. Values will be interpolated for years not specified&#13;
between years which are specified. Values after the last year entered with&#13;
D03 cards are computed using growth rates from the D05 card. The growth rates&#13;
are entered as pecentages on the D05 card and remain in effect until replaced.&#13;
The Sectoral Productivity is entered in a manner consistent with the&#13;
Sectoral Product Output. The D08 set of cards allows users to enter base&#13;
year sectoral productivities. The D09 and Dll cards are used in a fashion&#13;
analagous to the D03 and D05 cards.&#13;
The base year sectoral employment must be entered using the D14 card&#13;
if it differs from that obtained by summing the values on the LOI and L03 cards.&#13;
The D19 and D15 cards are used in a fashion analogous to the D03 and D05 cards.&#13;
The sectoral employment estimates are calculated for each sector as&#13;
a whole. The D20 card set is used to obtain sector/occupational distribution&#13;
of a given sectoral employment. Summation across occupational classification&#13;
for a,given sector must be equal to 100X. This distribution defaults to the&#13;
distribution of employees in the base year (LOI and L03 cards). Data are&#13;
specified by year. If data are not specified for a year they are interpolated&#13;
between the closest years before and after that year; values after the last&#13;
year specified default to the last year.&#13;
4.3.4     Educational Training System Input&#13;
The Educational/Training Simulation Model (ESM) or ETS, is used to&#13;
train Nationals and pool the graduates and dropouts by labor skill for entry&#13;
into the work force. The input for this section is contained on "E" and "S"&#13;
cards which allow the user to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Define the educational structure&#13;
Set base year enrollments&#13;
Identify intakes to the system&#13;
Specify promotion, dropout and repetition rates&#13;
Define teacher groups&#13;
Define manpower pools in terms of educational qualification&#13;
and probability that the individual will enter labor force&#13;
Maintain school age population by age and sex&#13;
*    Maintain "leakage" of nationals from the region upon graduation&#13;
The cards used are described in the table below:&#13;
Card ID                                       Description&#13;
EO0                                    ESM initialization&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
The same educational structure is used for all localities. The E01&#13;
card is used to define the constants and sizes of the system. It contains:&#13;
The number of courses (maximum of 300)&#13;
The number of age groups per course (maximum of 6)&#13;
The number of teacher groups (maximum of 30)&#13;
The minimum legal age to work&#13;
The minimum age to enter school&#13;
The Dummy courses to be used for males and females who have never&#13;
attended school&#13;
The E03 cards are used to enter the base year enrollments of the&#13;
courses described using E04 cards. An E03 card must be present for each&#13;
course and each locality. It contains an entry for each age group within each&#13;
course.&#13;
The structure of the system is described using E04 cards. These&#13;
cards describe each course in terms of:&#13;
Course title (24 characters)&#13;
Associated teacher group&#13;
Ideal age of enrollment&#13;
Follow-on courses that graduates of this course are qualified&#13;
to enter&#13;
*    Sex of enrollees in this course&#13;
One set of E04 cards is required for the simulation.&#13;
The E05 card is used to enter teacher group titles. The same titles&#13;
apply for all localities.&#13;
The E06 set of cards is used to identify the fraction of the course&#13;
enrollees who will repeat or dropout of the course. The remainder graduates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
are distributed to the various follow-on courses using the Promotion Distri-&#13;
bution Data (PRDD's) provided. These may be entered each year and remain&#13;
in effect until replaced.&#13;
The E07 cards are used to provide the entrance levels into various&#13;
courses.  Any course may be identified on an E07 card.&#13;
The E09 card is used to enter the student/teacher ratio. This in-&#13;
formation is used to estimate the size of the teacher labor force.&#13;
The program will use the E10 card to estimate population changes as&#13;
a function of labor force migration. The population change from year to year&#13;
will be used to adjust the sizes of the ESM courses.&#13;
As has been previously described, ESM also groups like educational&#13;
skills together in labor pools. This is done by requiring the user to enter&#13;
a complete list of which courses enter which pool. This is accomplished by&#13;
means of the S06 set of cards. As the courses are upgraded in future years&#13;
the corresponding pool can be changed. The S05 set of cards is used to&#13;
specify participation rates to be applied to the graduates and dropouts from&#13;
each course before placing them in the pools.&#13;
The underaged school leavers are held by course number and age until&#13;
they reach the minimum age to work. The S04 set of cards is used to initialize&#13;
the pools in the base year. The S09 set of cards is used to allow some of the&#13;
underaged to "illegally" enter the labor force prior to reaching the minimum&#13;
age to work.&#13;
The S10 card set allows additional entries or withdrawals from the&#13;
labor pools. It can be used by the user to retrain members of various pools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
The Sll card is used to identify the school leavers who will leave&#13;
the locality in search of employment. The rates will be by pool and thus be&#13;
effective for all ESM leavers.&#13;
4.3.5     Manpower Policy Input&#13;
The Manpower Policy Model inputs are contained on "P" cards. These&#13;
inputs allow users to:&#13;
Enter the correspondence between labor pools and sector/&#13;
occupation cells&#13;
Enter the nationalization levels&#13;
Enter priorities for worker distribution&#13;
Maintain regional population by nationality and age group&#13;
Enter desired ratio of expatriates groups to fulfill any&#13;
manpower shortages.&#13;
The cards used in this submodel are described below:&#13;
Card ID                                  Description&#13;
PO1                               Associated Labor Pool Identification&#13;
P02                               Nationalization Goals&#13;
P03                               Priority of Sector/Occupation&#13;
P04                               Time Lag of Nationals Allocation&#13;
P05                               Leakage Allocation&#13;
P06                               Population Group Definition&#13;
P07                               Base Year Population&#13;
P09                               Associated Population Movement&#13;
P10                               Expatriate Distribution&#13;
P1l                               Base Year Labor Force in Transition&#13;
P12                               Birth Rate&#13;
P13                               Population Mortality Rates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
A separate policy model may be set up for each locality.    With the&#13;
exception of the P06 card, the remainder are used for each locality.&#13;
The P01 card is used to identify the manpower pool corresponding&#13;
with each sector/occupation cell. The special identifier "ALL" may be used&#13;
in a manner similar to the L01 card to allow ease of data entry. The P02 card&#13;
contains Nationalization goals in percent. The employment level for Nationals&#13;
will never exceed this level and it will be used in the manpower allocation&#13;
routine as part of the distribution scheme. The default for cells not entered&#13;
is 100.0 percent. The P03 card contains the cell priorities. Cells with the&#13;
highest priority will draw their allotment from the pool first.&#13;
The reallocation of ESM and labor force leakages is accomplished&#13;
by introducing a time lag distribution and a regional distribution card.&#13;
Nationals from each locality who depart the locality will be grouped into the&#13;
standard labor pools. Time lag distribution, which can be entered by the user&#13;
for each pool and varied every year, is entered on a P04 card. Three numbers&#13;
are entered giving the percent of pool members to be reallocated in one, two&#13;
and three years. (Those not reallocated in one, two or three years are allo-&#13;
cated immediately.) The P05 card contains the distribution fractions and con-&#13;
trols how many Nationals will migrate to various regions. It may be changed&#13;
on an annual basis. The Pll card set is used by the user to indicate the&#13;
number of Nationals in transition by labor pool during the base year. The&#13;
card is optional and defaults to zero.&#13;
In order to assist in the analysis of required regional infrastruc-&#13;
tures, the Manpower Policy Model will maintain a regional population by Nation-&#13;
ality and age group. The P06 card set, which is entered with the global&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
data, will define the age groupings. Male and Female population figures will&#13;
be separately maintained withit each age -group. The P07 card set is used to&#13;
enter the population in the base year. Birth rates and mortality rates are&#13;
entered on the P12 and P13 cards, respectively.&#13;
The P09 card will allow the user to indicate a deviation in aver-&#13;
age family size and structure from the Regional Norm. Associated non-labor&#13;
force population movement will be calculated for both workers entering and&#13;
leaving the region. The progran will default to the population distribution&#13;
of the Nationality involved. The P09 card will allow users to indicate a&#13;
different population distribution, if desired.&#13;
The final user input allows the user to alter the ratio of expa-&#13;
triate groups working in a specific sector/occupation. After allocation of&#13;
Nationals and expatriates leaked from other regions of the solution, the&#13;
model allocates expatriates to fill any remaining jobs. This allocation is&#13;
made at the same ratio as the various Nationalities are currently working in&#13;
the country. The P10 card allows the user the option of altering that ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
4.4 CARD INPUT DECK SET UP&#13;
The card input deck may be placed in any order that the user desires.&#13;
It will be initially sorted to card ID, locality ID, and sequence number&#13;
orders. There may be either a complete data deck or a series of overriding&#13;
cards to be merged with the Master File specified on the CO1 card. Input&#13;
order will be maintained for duplicate ID and sequence number cards.&#13;
The table below shows a listing of the cards required to run the&#13;
model. All cards in the global data set are base year cards. The local cards&#13;
are divided into those used in the base year and those used for every year&#13;
after the base year.&#13;

4.5 CARD PUNCHING CONVENTIONS&#13;
A complete description of each type of card is given in Appendix A.&#13;
This section includes some general notes on conventions to be observed when&#13;
punching cards (or preparing data sheets for punching).&#13;
4.5.1 Numeric Values&#13;
Values which are indicated in the card descriptions of Appendix A&#13;
as integer must be punched without a decimal point. They should also be&#13;
punched as far to the right as possible within the field.&#13;
Values which are not integer can be punched with or without a&#13;
decimal point and may have a fractional part if a decimal point is used. If&#13;
the dec=inal point is not used, the value should be punched as far to the&#13;
right as possible within the field.&#13;
A non-integer numeric value may also be expressed in scientific&#13;
(exponential) form. In this case a number is followed by the letter E and&#13;
an integer. The value represented is the number multiplied by 10 raised to&#13;
the power denoted by the integer following E. For example 6.8E5 represents&#13;
680000; 3.22E-4 represents .000322.&#13;
4.5.2 Identifiers&#13;
Identifiers (or ID's) such as sector identifiers and occupation&#13;
identifiers are entered in 3-column fields. Any alphanumeric combination of&#13;
characters can be used for an identifier. It is recommended that strings of&#13;
characters be used which abbreviate the name of the group being identified;&#13;
e.g., "AGR" for agriculture, "PRO" for professional, "ARB" for Arabian, etc.&#13;
If an ID has fewer than three characters then the characters must be posi-&#13;
tioned within the 3-column field in exactly the same way each time the ID is&#13;
used. Also, blanks alLd zeros are not equivalent in an ID (as they are at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
the beginning of a itumeric field). For example, all of these are different&#13;
ID's:  it"1","1 1 it, is 1", "001"l.&#13;
4.5.3 Consistencv of Units&#13;
The user must ensure that consistent units are used throughout the&#13;
input data. This is especially important in the case of sector outputs and&#13;
productivity, where there is a great deal of freedom in choosing the units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Appendix A&#13;
Card Formats&#13;
The purpose of this appendix is to describe each of the cards&#13;
in use in the Expanded Model. The description includes:&#13;
. A listing of the fields of the card&#13;
* Notes on the allowed values which can be entered&#13;
in the fields&#13;
. Notes on default settings and extent of definition of&#13;
the data.&#13;
Section 4.0 describes how the cards interrelate with one another and the&#13;
model.&#13;

required for "B" and "U" runs and is not used for "S" runs.&#13;
(3)  The nationality ID of nationals must be one of the ID's&#13;
specified on the G04 card.&#13;
(4)  The base year is one year earlier than the earliest year&#13;
entered on any data card.&#13;
(5)  The last year of the simulation must be greater than the&#13;
base year. Data cards after the last year will be ignored.&#13;
There cannot be more than 15 simulation years.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Regional (Expanded) Model is one of
            a set of simulation models developed during a research
            project to study the implications of the explosion of
            international migration in the Middle East and North Africa
            Region for both labor-importing and labor-exporting
            countries. The models have been applied to study manpower
            problems and planning issues in several countries and proven
            to be a useful tool. This user's guide describes the
            input, output, use and operation of the model, which is a
            manpower forecasting model, implemented for IBM 370 systems.
