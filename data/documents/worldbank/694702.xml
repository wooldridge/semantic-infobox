This report is based on the findings of preparation missions and a pre-appraisal mission which visited Armenia&#13;
since July 1995. The core team, Alexandre Marc (Task Manager) and Toomas Palu (Co-Task Manager and&#13;
Health Specialist) were assisted by World Bank staff with expertise in areas related to the project components,&#13;
including: Margaret Grosh (PRDPH), Laura Rose (EC4MS), Mary Schmidt (ENVSP), Seema Manghee&#13;
(EC4MS), Wolfgang Munar (Consultant), Tamara Kanterman (EC4MS). The preparation of the project was&#13;
carried out by two working groups at the Ministry of Health composed of representatives from various&#13;
stakeholders, including the Ministries of Finance and Economy. The project concept was discussed in a&#13;
workshop comprising representatives from the central, regional and local levels of Government, health care&#13;
providers, and NGOs active in the sector. The local preparation team was assisted by a project preparation unit&#13;
based in the Ministry of Health and external consultants financed through a PHRD grant and other Trust Funds.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I.  ECONOMIC AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    RECENr ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
1.1    A landlocked country covering 29,800 square kilometers and with a population of 3.75&#13;
million, Armenia has few natural resources. Its people have survived through strong traditions of&#13;
education and entrepreneurship. Following the break up of the Soviet Union and independence in&#13;
1991, Armenia inherited a distorted, inefficient economy which was badly affected by the collapse of&#13;
the central planning system and disruption of traditional trading patterns. Economic and social&#13;
problems were compounded by the devastation of the 1988 earthquake, and by the economic siege&#13;
resulting from political conflicts in Georgia and the dispute with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.&#13;
A catastrophic decline in economic output followed, accompanied by hyper-inflation which&#13;
accelerated to 900% in the last two months of 1993 and continued through the first half of 1994,&#13;
averaging slightly over 1,500% a year.&#13;
1.2    Since 1994 Armenia has made huge strides in economic reform and establishing a suitable&#13;
policy framework. The stabilization program, sustained since spring 1994, brought the budget deficit&#13;
down to 7 percent of GDP in 1996, less than a sixth of the 1993 figure. Annual inflation has fallen to&#13;
less than 10 percent. After a year's collapse, GDP grew by 5.4% in 1994, almost 7 percent in 1995&#13;
and 5.8 percent in 1996. At the heart of the Government's reform program has been the stimulation&#13;
of the private sector. Almost all agricultural land and 60% of enterprises have been privatized. Prices&#13;
have been liberalized and subsidies removed. Clearing trade arrangements have been eliminated, and&#13;
foreign exchange and trade regimes liberalized. The administrative structure of the country has&#13;
changed from the former complex structure of 37 districts, 27 townships, 31 settlements and 479&#13;
village councils into a two tier administration of 11 provinces (marz, with the governor appointed by&#13;
central government) and 930 communities (hamaink, elected council). 1&#13;
1.3    Living standards have fallen sharply due to the collapse in real wages, compounded by the&#13;
removal of subsidies on essential goods and drastic cuts in spending on social services. Despite&#13;
positive growth since 1994 which has allowed a slight recovery, real wages are still about a fifth of&#13;
what they were in 1992. Although comparable data are not available for earlier periods, the 1994-&#13;
1995 household expenditure survey indicates that the fall in living standards for many has been&#13;
accompanied by increasing inequality in the distribution of income.&#13;
1.4    Health expenditure declined in 1992-94 by 35% and education spending by 39% in real&#13;
terms. Under the structural adjustment program, the Government is now attempting to increase social&#13;
sector spending as a percentage of total expenditures. It is clear that only a major restructuring of&#13;
social sector spending and in-depth reforms of health, education and social protection systems will&#13;
result in improved social services in the medium and long term.&#13;

B.    HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
1.5     Before health care reformn began in 1995, the system was based on the Soviet Union model.&#13;
Organization, management and finance were centrally coordinated through the Ministry of Health.&#13;
Services were delivered through a territorially structured hierarchical network of 182 hospitals&#13;
(general and specialized) and 1,500 outpatient facilities (health-posts, ambulatories and polyclinics).&#13;
The Sanitary Epidemiology Stations network concentrated on infectious diseases prevention and&#13;
surveillance.&#13;
1.6     The Armenian health sector is now being reorganized to adjust to the new socio-economic&#13;
environment and respond to the people's needs. The key challenges facing the health sector are the&#13;
deteriorating health status of the population and the inability of the hospital oriented and resource&#13;
constrained system to meet the health needs of the population.&#13;
Deteriorating Health&#13;
1.7     This is the most critical long term public health issue in Armenia. It is due to: (i) worsening&#13;
adult health status, reflected in declining adult life expectancy and increasing burden of disease&#13;
among adult population; (ii) continuing poor maternal and child health (MCH); and, (iii) re-&#13;
emergence of communicable diseases and diseases related to poor socio-economic conditions.&#13;
1.8     Worsening adult health. In the 1950s and 1960s, health status improved steadily. This&#13;
was supported by the Soviet health system which effectively addressed mortality and morbidity&#13;
related to infectious diseases. In the 1960s and 1970s, the health status of Armenians compared&#13;
favorably with other industrialized countries. In the late 1970s and 1980s, it began to deteriorate,&#13;
particularly compared with continuous improvements in OECD countries. In 1993, life expectancy at&#13;
age 30 was 41.0 years for men and 46.4 years for women, compared to 43.3 and 49.2 respectively in&#13;
1980. Increased cardio-vascular mortality (57% in 1980-93) contributed to the steady rise in overall&#13;
mortality and lower adult life expectancy.&#13;
1.9     In 1995, according to the Burden of Disease study, Armenia lost roughly 400,000 Disability&#13;
Adjusted Life years (DALYs)2 due to premature death and disability (Table I . 1). Poor health status&#13;
of adult males is the main finding of the study. Males accounted for 59% of total DALYs lost, 54%&#13;
of which occurred between the age of 15 and 59 - the productive years of life. The gender gap in&#13;
health status in Armenia is higher than the average for countries in the former Soviet Union&#13;
(male/female DALY loss ratios 1.42 and 1.32 respectively).&#13;
1.10     Data on behavioral risk factors are scarce. A study conducted by National Institute of&#13;
Health (1995) revealed that 56.4% of boys and 20.7% of girls from 14-16 years of age smoke.3 The&#13;
study reported family, peer pressure and schools as factors prompting children to start smoking. No&#13;
laws currently exist in Armenia to regulate the sale or advertising of tobacco products. Individuals do&#13;
not appear to take responsibility for their health. This is partly due to lack of information and health&#13;
education, but also because of long term adverse incentives. Although health care services incur out-&#13;
2      DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Year) aggregates years of life lost due to premature death and years of&#13;
life lived with disability into a single health status indicator. The approach was first used for the World&#13;
Development Report in 1993 and is being used to assess burden of ill health on a society and for cost-benefit and&#13;
cost-effectiveness analysis in the health sector.&#13;

of-pocket costs to patients, attitudes have not yet changed. Health promotion and disease prevention&#13;
programs that should be free or impose minimal costs do not exist.&#13;

1.11     Chronic non-communicable diseases need to be given high priority. The risk factors for&#13;
cardio-vascular disease, cancer and injury are well known. The prevalence of risk factors needs to be&#13;
assessed and cost effective health promotion and disease prevention measures introduced to bring&#13;
about long term improvements in health status.&#13;
1.12     Maternal and Child Health. Despite improvements in reducing infant mortality (official&#13;
indicator was 14.2 per 1,000 births in 1995), Armenia continues to lose DALYs in the early years of&#13;
life (9% of DALYs are lost in the age group 0-4 compared to 6% in established market economies5).&#13;
Since the early 1990s, there is evidence of increased premature births and anemia in pregnancy&#13;
indicating a decline in MCH. Primary health care measures such as family planning, nutritional&#13;
support and breast-feeding programs are likely to improve the health status of children and mothers.&#13;
The perinatal period is sensitive to the quality of medical care, and improved clinical practices are&#13;
likely to lead to reduction of perinatal and maternal mortality. Appropriate equipment and&#13;
standardization of professional expertise and facilities are required for lasting improvement.&#13;
1.13     In relative terns, however, the official MCH indicators compare favorably with other FSU&#13;
countries. Extensive humanitarian support from international agencies (UNICEF, EU), intemational&#13;
NGOs and diaspora has helped to prevent major decline in MCH. These programs need to be re-&#13;
integrated into the national health care system.&#13;
1.14     Re-emergence of poverty related diseases. Tuberculosis, water-born infectious diseases,&#13;
respiratory diseases, vaccine preventable diseases and other poverty related diseases have re-emerged.&#13;
Economic breakdown, war, the influx of refugees, earthquake and the trade blockade have resulted in&#13;
a decline of living conditions. Central heating has not been operational for years, water-supply has&#13;
been intermittent, at best, and electricity has been available for only a few hours a day until last year.&#13;
Cold weather, poor hygiene and continuous stress contribute to the ill health of society.&#13;

1.15     There were 36 cases of epidemic diphtheria reported in 1994 and 29 in 1995. In 1993,&#13;
there were 338 measles cases reported and 187 cases in 1995. The gap in vaccine coverage is a&#13;
transitional problem and has been solved through effective cooperation between GoA and UNICEF,&#13;
USAID, CDC6 and Diaspora organizations.&#13;
Inability of Health System to Deal with Health Needs&#13;
1.16     The Armenia health care system is inefficient, chronically under funded and provides no&#13;
equitable access. Structural reform is sorely needed. The GoA needs to improve efficiency of the&#13;
health care system by focusing scarce public resources on cost-effective public health and medical&#13;
interventions, improving the balance between the hospital and the primary health care sector and&#13;
protect access to essential health care for the most vulnerable population.&#13;
1.17     Chronic under funding. The health sector became increasingly under funded towards the&#13;
end of the Soviet era because of declining productivity and a slow down of economic growth. Public&#13;
sector health care spending represented between 2-3% of GDP during the late 1980s. After the&#13;
collapse of the Soviet Union, public sector health care expenditures (HCE) fell sharply as a proportion&#13;
of GDP and as a share of public expenditures. The decline in real expenditures was aggravated by&#13;
high inflation. In 1997, public spending on health care was estimated at 2% of GDP, 6% of total&#13;
Govemment expenditure and US$6.75 per capita. This is less than the 1993 WDR7 recommended&#13;
minimum of US$12 and US$20 for basic health care programs in low and lower-middle income&#13;
countries. Humanitarian aid from international organizations and diaspora has been vital in the first&#13;
years of economic collapse. Medicines and supplies provided through humanitarian assistance in&#13;
1995 were estimated at about US$4 per capita. This aid, however, is rapidly falling as the country&#13;
moves from an emergency to a development stage. Low public funding and informal out-of-pocket&#13;
payments are widespread, raising serious equity issues. The Ministry of Health working group&#13;
estimates that in 1995 private health spending were in the magnitude of US$60 million, whereas&#13;
extrapolations using the data collected from the Social Assessment put private spending at about&#13;
US$40 million (US$16 and US$10.8 per capita respectively). See Table 1.2.&#13;

1.18     Low efficiency of health services. The Armenian system has a hospital and specialist&#13;
bias, excess facilities and hospital beds, and imbalanced human resources. By design, the Soviet&#13;
health care system was based on: a territorial principle; strong primary health care system comprising&#13;
6      CDC - Centers for Disease Control&#13;
7      WDR - World Development Report&#13;
8      Reservations to all financial data includes inconsistency and fragmentation of available information,&#13;
and uncertain baseline data, such as population number.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
general physician, pediatrician, and nurse/midwife; and the vertical Sanitary Epidemiology Stations&#13;
system. Beginning in the 1960s, the principle was distorted because of political motives to pass the&#13;
West in health sector input indicators. Advances in technology led the system to move rapidly&#13;
towards a hospital and specialist bias. By 1990, Armenia had created an impressive capacity of 4&#13;
physicians, 10 nurses and 9.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population (compare with respective indicators&#13;
of 2.5, 5 and 8 per 1,000 population in established market economies).9 Their use, however, was not&#13;
efficient (for example, in 1994, ALOS 10 in hospitals was 16 days and the bed occupancy rate only&#13;
44%) and health outcomes did not compare favorably with other European countries. Moreover,&#13;
such a capacity is increasingly difficult to sustain for the Government.&#13;
1.19     The capacity of the Primary Health Care (PHC) network to support the delivery of&#13;
ambulatory health services is weak due to lack of infrastructure, inadequate equipment and shortage&#13;
of trained staff. In the 1970s, district health officers functions were discontinued and responsibilities&#13;
for the management of the district health care system was passed to directors of district hospitals.&#13;
This shift also influenced the allocation of funds: 89% of public funds were spent on hospital care&#13;
and only 2% on outpatient services in 1993. Outpatient facilities have been starved of funds for&#13;
maintenance, salaries, equipment and drug supplies, particularly during the recent economic crisis.&#13;
Agricultural cooperatives that usually supported local health care facilities were dissolved when land&#13;
was privatized. Currently, communities are not involved in decisions related to health care delivery&#13;
and quality.&#13;
1.20     Primary health care providers have low professional status and only 24% of rural&#13;
ambulatories are staffed with a physician. Most cases are being referred to specialists or hospitals&#13;
because of lack of skills, inadequate equipment, supplies and physical environment. Moreover,&#13;
patients often by-pass this first level of health care: according to the Social Assessment, 36% of&#13;
patients by-pass the first level and refer themselves to specialist care. During 1980s, dramatic&#13;
growth of ambulance services occurred to compensate for the lack of effective primary health care&#13;
services.&#13;
1.21     Public health capacity to deal with primary and secondary prevention of chronic non-&#13;
communicable disease is limited. Sanitary-Epidemiology Stations system has capacity to deal with&#13;
infectious diseases and sanitary surveillance but has no experience and capacity to implement cost-&#13;
effective primary and secondary prevention measures for non-communicable diseases. In the&#13;
difficult first years of transition, some primary health care programs (immunization, maternal and&#13;
child health programs) were funded and managed by international donors and now need to be re-&#13;
integrated into the national public health system to ensure their sustainability.&#13;
1.22     The GoA needs to take steps to improve the balance between the hospital sector, primary&#13;
health care and public health services. This requires proactive restructuring policies for the hospital&#13;
sector, strengthening PHC sector inputs and management, developing institutional capacity for&#13;
modem public health practice and implementing inter-sectoral public health policies.&#13;
1.23     The FSU health financing system provided poor incentives for efficient use of resources&#13;
and contributed to the build-up of excess capacity. Health care facilities were financed by line-item&#13;
budgets based on existing capacity of beds and health personnel. With chronic public under-funding&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
and widespread informal payments, health care facilities have diversified their sources of revenues.&#13;
The system is not transparent, however. Private payments do not contribute to maintenance, and there&#13;
is no accountability in the use of private funds.&#13;
1.24     Low quality and inequitable access to health services. Despite seemingly good&#13;
coverage, access to health services is worsening. Since 1985, statistics show considerable decline in&#13;
health services use. The Social Assessment revealed that the main factors for declining access are&#13;
high out-of-pocket costs (fees to health personnel, pharmaceuticals and other disposables) and a&#13;
perceived decline in quality (lack of heating and electricity, poor sanitary conditions of facilities). In&#13;
1995-96, the median out-of-pocket cost was US$8 and US$77 for outpatient visit and hospital stay&#13;
respectively. The Social Assessment also showed lower access to health services for the rural&#13;
population, as shown by higher rates of non-diagnosed health problems and fewer visits to qualified&#13;
health care providers. The rural population also had less access to medicines and higher overall&#13;
access costs because of transportation difficulties.&#13;
1.25     The burden of private spending falls on the sick who are more likely to be in the low&#13;
income category. The main source of private funding (43.5%) has been sale of assets, such as&#13;
property, livestock and jewelry. Due to difficult economic conditions, social solidarity has eroded.&#13;
Both the Qualitative Poverty Assessment and the Social Assessment have revealed that transfers and&#13;
support tends to be limited to the extended family. There are no private risk-pooling arrangements&#13;
and no formal insurance schemes. The consequences of a catastrophic acute or chronic illness can be&#13;
devastating for a household.&#13;
1.26     The Poverty Assessment shows high levels of poverty (28% of the population in 1995).&#13;
Targeting, however, has proved to be difficult because of the importance of informal revenues in the&#13;
economy and lack of correlation between poverty and traditional socio-economic categories. The&#13;
Social Assessment also showed that in the health sector, there appears to be some discretion among&#13;
doctors as to how much to charge informally for health services. Rural physicians would accept&#13;
payment in kind; however, in towns, cash payments prevail and constitute a serious barrier to&#13;
patients' access to health care. Costs related to medical supplies and pharmaceuticals are less flexible&#13;
than health personnel charges because most pharmacies have been privatized. These factors will&#13;
make protecting access of the poor to health services difficult.&#13;
C.    HEALTH CARE REFORM STRATEGY&#13;
Concept of reform&#13;
1.27     The Government's health care reform strategy is laid out in the 1995 Minister of Health's&#13;
"Program on Development and Reforms of the Health Care System of the Republic of Armenia,&#13;
1996-2000." The 1996 "Law on Medical Aid and Services to the Population" provides the legal&#13;
framework for implementation of the strategy. The reform plan includes health financing&#13;
restructuring; reorientation of the health system towards primary health care; improving and updating&#13;
medical education; introduction of licensing of professionals; giving management of health care&#13;
facilities to autonomous state enterprises and decentralizing responsibilities for health care system&#13;
administration to regions and local authorities; privatizing some health care institutions; and&#13;
improving health care management information systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
1.28     The Armenia Primary Health Care (PHC) strategy" establishes PHC as outpatient health&#13;
care services, integrating "traditional" primary health care (e.g. immunization), primary and&#13;
secondary prevention of non-communicable diseases (health education and screening), and personal&#13;
curative health care services aimed at responding to common health problems and providing&#13;
alternatives to hospital care. PHC services will be provided by a PHC team that will include a family&#13;
doctor, pediatrician, general practice nurse and midwife. In the longer term, a social worker and&#13;
dentist may be added. Patients and families can choose their provider. The team will act as a&#13;
gatekeeper to specialized health care services. The PHC facilities will be transferred to local&#13;
authority ownership but PHC could also be provided on a private basis. The state mandate to provide&#13;
basic health care services will be funded through risk-adjusted capitation payments by the State&#13;
Health Agency. Vertical PHC programs will be integrated into a Basic Benefits Package (BBP)12 but&#13;
some sanitary-epidemiology programs will remain vertical. The strategy foresees a gradual&#13;
implementation of reform. This will include developing the appropriate regulatory framework,&#13;
training and re-training of PHC providers, practice guidelines development and investment into&#13;
rehabilitation of PHC facilities and equipment. In fact, the reform builds on the original Soviet&#13;
health system principles, but does correct the distortions, integrates it with modem financing&#13;
incentives and management techniques, and introduces choice of provider.&#13;
1.29     The core elements of the health financing reform strategy13 are the separation of health&#13;
care provision and financing. These provide autonomous "state enterprise" status to health facilities,&#13;
introducing appropriate financing incentives for efficiency, limiting state responsibility for financing&#13;
the Basic Benefits Package and protecting access to all services for vulnerable groups and improving&#13;
the financial or management information system. The State Health Agency will be created to&#13;
purchase services included in the BBP. In the short and medium tern, the Government will continue&#13;
to finance public health services from the general budget. During implementation of reformns, the&#13;
GoA intends to develop institutional capacity, change health care providers' financial reporting&#13;
standards, improve the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the BBP and regulate and make&#13;
transparent private infornal payments for health care services.&#13;
Status of reforms&#13;
1.30     Since December 1996, most state and regional hospitals have obtained state enterprise&#13;
status. By the end of 1997, all health care providers, except for a few public health institutions,&#13;
should have the same status. The Government is introducing a program based financing system&#13;
which is based on volume of services for hospitals and per capita financing of primary health care&#13;
services. The GoA is increasing the relative share of public sector health care expenditure for public&#13;
health care programs and outpatient health care services: an increase from 24% of public sector health&#13;
care spending in 1996 to 29% in 1997. The GoA has privatized most pharmaceutical retailers and&#13;
wholesalers, dentistry offices and a sophisticated outpatient Diagnostic Center. The Diagnostic&#13;
Center has a positive, transparent management and financing system. In 1997, the GoA will privatize&#13;
six tertiary care hospitals in the capital city (1,520 beds in total) with no loss in public sector&#13;
provision of essential services. It has also passed a law regulating the licensing of health providers&#13;
and has set up a computerized licensing center at the MoH.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

1.31     The health sector is complex and many issues are intertwined. The GoA recognizes the&#13;
need to develop and consolidate health related legislation, modernize functions and management of&#13;
the Ministry of Health, modernize public health services to address the increasing burden of non-&#13;
communicable diseases (such as cardio-vascular diseases, cancer and injury), review Government&#13;
policy on training medical professionals, rationalize excess hospital capacity, improve health sector&#13;
managerial capacity and develop a national drug policy. Interventions need to be prioritized and&#13;
backed with resources and technical expertise due to limited capacity. In the short and medium term,&#13;
the GoA will implement primary health care and health financing reform with the support of the&#13;
proposed World Bank credit; develop a national drug policy with support from WHO/EURO;&#13;
improve health policy planning capacity at the MoH and regional level, provide training for health&#13;
care managers with the assistance of EU/TACIS; and continue to support MCH programs with the&#13;
support of UNICEF. In addition, many national and international NGOs active in the health sector&#13;
are reorienting their activities from emergency towards developmental assistance.&#13;
D.    RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.32     Stabilization of Armenia's economy and political environment has reduced the need for&#13;
international emergency assistance and increased the need for developmental support. The World&#13;
Bank has been engaged in a policy dialogue with the GoA since 1995 and has supported policy&#13;
development with technical assistance from both PHRD and Dutch Government grants. The current&#13;
project is consistent with the World Bank strategies in Arnenia and the health sector.&#13;
1.33     Linkage with economic and sector work. Relevant economic and sector work (ESW) for&#13;
the social sectors have been completed, including a Poverty Assessment, Public Expenditure Review&#13;
(PER) and the Social Assessment Report on Health and Education.14 Much health sector work was&#13;
done in the project preparation phase. 15 In addition, Bankwide sector work was used for project&#13;
rationale.'6 The findings and conclusions of the ESW have been used in the policy dialogue with&#13;
Government on health care reform strategy and on the design of the proposed project. Relevant&#13;
documents are included in the project file (see Annex 9).&#13;
1.34     The Poverty Assessment stresses the importance of improving health and education as a&#13;
way to reduce poverty. Ensuring access to basic education and health services for poor households is&#13;
essential to an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. Such access will also play a crucial&#13;
role in preventing transitional poverty from becoming structural. At the same time, Armenia's highly&#13;
inefficient health and education systems need to be reformed to reverse the trend of declining school&#13;
enrollments and deteriorating quality and standards in both health and education sector.&#13;
14    "Armenia: Confronting Poverty Issues" (World Bank, 15693-AM, 1996); "Public Expenditures in&#13;

Assessment Report on Health and Education Sectors in Armenia" (consultant report, project files, 1996).&#13;
"Health Financing Reform in Armenia: final report of technical assistance provided to the Ministry of&#13;
Health" (consultant report, project files, 1996); "Armnenia: Primary Health Care reform" (consultant report,&#13;
project files, 1996); "Armenia: Burden of Disease and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Basic Benefits Package"&#13;
(consultant report, project files, 1997).&#13;
16    "Health Sector Assistance Strategy for ECA Region" (a World Bank ECA regional report, draft, 1997)&#13;
and "Sector Strategy Paper for Health and Nutrition and Population Sector" (a World Bank report, draft, 1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.35     The PER states that investing in basic education and health should be the Armenian&#13;
Government's highest priority. Armenia has relatively little agricultural or mineral resources to boost&#13;
its growth and its greatest asset remains the people. Armenians are highly educated, hard working&#13;
and entrepreneurial. Preserving and enhancing this human capital is a highly efficient way to ensure&#13;
sustained economic growth along with expanding job opportunities and poverty alleviation.&#13;
1.36     The Health Sector Assistance Strategy for ECA countries establishes the following&#13;
priorities for World Bank assistance: to develop institutions, functions and structures that promote&#13;
medium-term goals of improving governance and performance in the health sector; support country&#13;
efforts to improve the allocation of resources in health sector; improve appropriateness of clinical&#13;
intervention and increase their cost-effectiveness and technical proficiency; assist ECA countries to&#13;
design health financing and health delivery system reforms; and respond to special health needs and&#13;
health crises.&#13;
1.37     Linkage to Country Assistance Strategy. The World Bank strategy in Armenia is&#13;
described in the limited country assistance strategy (CAS), as discussed by the Board of Directors&#13;
during the presentation of the Rehabilitation Credit on February 28, 1995, and the revised CAS, that&#13;
will be presented to the Board of Directors in summer 1997. The Armenia CAS focuses on private&#13;
sector development and on supporting social sustainability and alleviation of poverty. The latter&#13;
should be accomplished through the strengthening of the social safety net and through improvements&#13;
in the quality of, and access to, basic health and education. In the health sector this translates into&#13;
ensuring minimum public spending on health and diversification/legitimization of other sources of&#13;
funding; improving efficiency of the health system; and improving access for the poor.&#13;
1.38    International Co-ordination. The CAS stresses the important role the World Bank can&#13;
play in coordinating interventions of other donors and act as a catalyst in attracting other sources.&#13;
This project has been prepared in close cooperation with the UNICEF, EU/TACIS and WHO/EURO.&#13;
UNICEF has a significant field presence, and EU/TACIS has a ECU I million TA project in the&#13;
pipeline. UNICEF and TACIS representatives have joined World Bank missions on five occasions to&#13;
coordinate developmental assistance. UNICEF will participate in development and implementation&#13;
of this proposed IDA supported project which is expected to integrate UNICEF programs in the long&#13;
term. WHO/EURO will be supporting the development of the National Drug Policy. The MoH has&#13;
established a staff position to coordinate both humanitarian and developmental support. The&#13;
incumbent will be an ex officio member of the project coordination committee.&#13;
II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.    OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1     The project will support the implementation of the Government of Armenia health financing&#13;
and primary health care reform. The project objectives are to: (i) improve quality and efficiency of&#13;
primary health care through training and retraining of primary health care staff, introduction of&#13;
practice guidelines and improving the infrastructure and equipment in selected PHC facilities; (ii)&#13;
improve efficiency, transparency and targeting of public health spending by introducing basic benefits&#13;
package, performance based provider payment methods and modern financial management; and, (iii)&#13;
mobilize communities to take an active role in defining local health care priorities and sustaining&#13;
basic health care services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
B.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.2     The project will be implemented over four years by the Ministry of Health, the State Health&#13;
Agency, the National Institute of Health, the State Medical University, Medical College as well as&#13;
elected regional health authorities and communities. The Ministry of Health will supervise and a&#13;
Project Management Unit will be created to manage the project. Total project costs are&#13;
approximately US$12.1 million and an IDA credit in the amount of US$10 million is proposed.&#13;
2.3     The project comprises:&#13;
I.    Strengthening Primary Health Care System through&#13;
a.    Primary Health Care Providers Training Program&#13;
b.    Primary Health Care Development Program&#13;
c.    Development of Primary Health Care Guidelines.&#13;
2.    Strengthening the Armenia Health Financing System through&#13;
a.    Establishment of the State Health Agency&#13;
b.    Improvement of Basic Benefits Package&#13;
c.    Improvement of Provider Payment Methodology&#13;
d.    Improvement of Management Information Systems.&#13;
3.    Project Management.&#13;
C.    PROJECT COMPONENT 1: STRENGTHENING PRIMARY HEALTH CARE&#13;
(US$6.1 MILLION BASE COST)&#13;
2.4     This component supports the implementation of the PHC strategy. PHC implies outpatient&#13;
health care services and integrates "traditional" primary health care (e.g. immunization), primary and&#13;
secondary prevention of non-communicable diseases (health education and screening) and personal&#13;
curative health care services aimed at responding to common health problems and providing&#13;
alternatives to hospital care. The aim is to develop an enabling environment for the improvement of&#13;
the quality of and accessibility to PHC services in Armenia The component will support the GoA to&#13;
develop training and re-training capacity of PHC providers, selected communities to rehabilitate and&#13;
equip PHC facilities and train their staff, and the development of PHC practice guidelines.&#13;
Sub-component 1.1 Primary Health Care Providers Training Program (US$2.2 million base&#13;
cost)&#13;
2.5     Under the PHC strategy, primary health care level providers will be converted into general&#13;
or family medicine practitioners able to offer comprehensive preventive and curative services in&#13;
outpatient setting. They will be supported by qualified middle level personnel and have more&#13;
independence in decision making. The strategy calls for substantial investment in training and&#13;
retraining of primary health care personnel and standardization of responsibilities. This sub-&#13;
component of the project will support training and retraining of primary health care providers at the&#13;
National Institute of Health, State Medical University and Medical College. A PHC Training&#13;
Coordination Committee, comprising representatives of the training institutions, the Ministry of&#13;
Health and medical profession, has been established to co-ordinate training activities.&#13;
Assu es were obtained during negotiations that the Government shall maintain a PHC Training&#13;
Coordination Committee. [para. 6. 1g.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
2.6     The National Institute of Health will organize re-training of all four categories of existing&#13;
primary health care providers: district therapists, district pediatricians, nurses and midwives. The&#13;
project builds on the NIH experience in post-graduate and continuous education of health&#13;
professionals in Armenia. The NIH will provide academic training in the Chair of Family&#13;
Medicine/General Practice, as well as practical training in affiliated FM/GP practices. It is expected&#13;
that the first trainees will be admitted in the Fall of 1998. According to Government strategy, all&#13;
PHC providers will be re-qualified over 10 years. During the life of the project, the NIH will re-train&#13;
700 providers or about 15% of the planned supply of PHC providers. The NIH will also prepare a&#13;
program of continuous education in family medicine for those retrained or those who have undergone&#13;
formal post-graduate training in family medicine and have been certified as PHC providers. The&#13;
continuous training programs will begin in the year 2000.&#13;
2.7     The State Medical University has a long tradition and high reputation in undergraduate and&#13;
residency training of physicians. It will now establish a Department of Family Medicine/General&#13;
Practice, which will design a curriculum in family medicine for undergraduate and postgraduate&#13;
medical students and will run residency programs in Family Medicine/General Practice. The long-&#13;
term goal is for the SMU to become the main supplier of family practitioners in the country. The&#13;
teaching of family medicine in under- and post-graduate programs is planned to begin in the fall of&#13;
1998 and will train 60 new family practitioners by the end of the project.&#13;
2.8     The Medical College is the leading undergraduate training institution of nurses and&#13;
midwives in Armenia. It will introduce changes in the training curricula for nurses and midwives&#13;
according to the reform requirements of PHC system.&#13;
2.9     The project will finance renovation and equipment for training, technical assistance for&#13;
curriculum development, fellowships, short-term external training and workshops for training&#13;
trainers.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government shall ensure that the training&#13;
facilities (including hostels) to be rehabilitated under the Prroject. shall at all times. be available to&#13;
accommodate students enrolled in the PHC training and pro grams at the NIH SMU and Medical&#13;
College. [para. 6. .c]&#13;
Sub-component 1.2 Primary Health Care Development Program (US$3.5 million base cost)&#13;
2.10     This proposed sub-component builds on the successful experience of the Armenia Social&#13;
Investment Fund (ASIF) in engaging communities and local governments in addressing local&#13;
priorities and implementing small-scale infrastructure rehabilitation projects. The main objective is&#13;
to improve the quality of PHC services in localities by involving communities in the management and&#13;
financing, providing incentives to staff to improve services, rehabilitating infrastructure and&#13;
providing equipment and training. The selection of teams and facilities will be based on eligibility&#13;
criteria laid out in the Operational Manual of the Primary Health Care Development Program&#13;
(PHCDP). The Operational Manual also defines the eligible expenditure categories for PHCDP&#13;
grants, and describes procedures for promotion, identification, formulation, pre-appraisal, appraisal,&#13;
implementation, and monitoring. It is estimated that this pilot project will cover 70 facilities, which&#13;
is about 5% of all facilities in Armenia. It will help with the implementation of the health care reformn&#13;
by showing improvement of quality and access to health care services at the local level in the&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.11     The program will be managed by a PHCDP unit under the PMU and work in close&#13;
collaboration with regional health departments and local governments. The program will be demand-&#13;
driven. The unit staff will promote Facility Management Boards and invite and support them to&#13;
submit proposals for grants, according to pre-set guidelines. Local governments and beneficiaries are&#13;
required to contribute an average of 10% of project costs. After pre-appraisal, the program will&#13;
provide technical assistance to selected facilities for a business plan. The plan will describe changes&#13;
the management board will implement and state its strategies for collection of user fees,&#13;
improvements in quality of services, and the creation of health development plan. The plan will also&#13;
include indicators and benchmarks to monitor improvements in services. The appraisal will review&#13;
the quality of the PHC team, commitment of both local government and communities to support the&#13;
facility and feasibility of the plan. Micro-project plans that meet appraisal criteria will be approved&#13;
by the program committee.&#13;
2.12     PHCDP and the Facility Management Board will sign a performance contract which will&#13;
specify certain performance benchmarks. Facilities that meet the proposed benchmarks will be&#13;
eligible for a second-tranche financing to support some recurrent cost (up to 5% of the total cost of&#13;
the civil works).&#13;
2.13     Civil works will be evaluated and supervised by ASIF engineers. They will work under a&#13;
cooperative agreement with the Health PMU. Program activities will be supervised by a committee&#13;
which will include Ministry of Health representatives and NGOs active in health care. PHCDP unit&#13;
staff, with support from regional health departments, will supervise the micro-projects.&#13;
2.14     The project will finance civil works, medical equipment and furniture, pharmaceutical&#13;
supplies, training for health providers, information campaign, transportation of equipment and&#13;
supplies to facilities.&#13;
Sub-component 1.3 Primary Health Care Guidelines Development (US$0.4 million base cost)&#13;
2.15     Practice guidelines are important to ensure quality and efficiency of medical practice and&#13;
to estimate the cost of services to ensure adequate reimbursement. Armenia has been using protocols&#13;
and reference books for inpatient care. None have been used for outpatient care except some&#13;
initiatives for maternal and child health care supported by UNICEF. The objective of this component&#13;
is to prepare guidelines for PHC.&#13;
2.16     The project will help establish of a working group on PHC guidelines at the National&#13;
Institute of Health. It will develop guidelines for preventive health care, including: (i) screening and&#13;
diagnostic procedures; (ii) medical case management; (iii) practice management including financial&#13;
and patient administration and responsibilities within the PHC team; and, (iv) reporting to national&#13;
and sub-national health authorities. In the short and medium term, PHC guidelines will be established&#13;
by: district therapist, pediatricians, and medical specialists. They will take account of other country&#13;
experiences through specialized literature, technical assistance and study tours. The long-term goal is&#13;
for newly trained family practitioners to gradually take over the preparation and adoption of&#13;
guidelines. The project will also support dissemination of guidelines among health professionals&#13;
through publications and workshops for health professionals.&#13;
2.17     The project will finance refurbishment of office space for the working group, office&#13;
equipment, study tours, foreign/local TA, and costs of printing and dissemination of guidelines.&#13;

D.    PROJECT COMPONENT 2: STRENGTHENING HEALTH FINANCING SYSTEM&#13;
(US$3.6 MILLION BASE COST)&#13;
2.18     Armenia health financing reform aims to shift from input based financing toward targeted&#13;
and performance-based payment to health care providers. This would include: (i) separation of health&#13;
care provision from health care financing, resulting in transparency in the purchaser-provider&#13;
relationship for publicly funded services; (ii) clarification of the Government's responsibilities for&#13;
funding health care provision by designing a cost effective basic benefits package (BBP) and&#13;
introducing a way to continuously improve the BBP; (iii) improving the methodology for paying&#13;
health care providers and introducing incentives for efficient provision of services and monitoring of&#13;
providers performance; and, (iv) streamlining the ways to allocate, implement, control and monitor&#13;
the health financial system by establishing a Health Management Information System.&#13;
2.19     The health financing component will support the design and establishment of a State&#13;
Health Agency and Health Management Information System, and development of the basic health&#13;
benefits package and provider payment methodology.&#13;
Sub-component 2.1 Establishing a State Health Agency (US$2.1 million base cost)&#13;
2.20     The State Health Agency's main function will be management of public funds to pay&#13;
Armenia health care providers for services provided under the BBP. The functions of the SHA&#13;
include allocating resources among regions, developing pricing and provider payment methodology,&#13;
implementing a performance based contracting system between the health care purchasers and&#13;
providers, auditing health care providers and analysis of financial data. New financing methods are&#13;
expected to increase the cost-effectiveness of public health spending through financial incentives and&#13;
control of the volume and quality of care provided. The agency will also relieve the MoH of routine&#13;
management of the health care system. The MoH can then focus on strategic health policy issues,&#13;
regulate the system, prepare legislation, monitor and carry out quality assurance, licensing and&#13;
accreditation. The EU/TACIS health project is expected to provide technical assistance to the&#13;
Government in policy planning and management.&#13;
2.21     The SHA will be a quasi-autonomous public body, with a 12 member Board, central office&#13;
and regional branch offices. There will be two permanent representatives from: the Ministries of&#13;
Health, Finance, Economy, Social Affairs and Yerevan Municipality. Two representatives from the&#13;
regions will rotate annually. It will employ 135 people, 50% of whom will be transferred from&#13;
central health agencies and others from various institutions and hospitals. The size of the civil service&#13;
will not increase. A working group will be created on July 1, 1997 to prepare the by-laws for the&#13;
agency, which will be established by a Government decree by January 1998. The agency will&#13;
renovate office space, establish the Health Management Information System (HMIS), develop&#13;
administrative procedures, train staff and implement pilots to test new payment methodologies and&#13;
procedures during 1998. As of January 1, 1999, the SHA will carry out all functions defined in its&#13;
charter.&#13;
2.22     The project will finance renovation of the agency's building and branch offices; office&#13;
equipment and furniture; computer hard and software for the Health Management Information&#13;
System, vehicles, foreign and local technical assistance; fellowships in health economics, financing,&#13;
organization and management; and short term study tours for agency staff to exchange experiences&#13;
with institutions in other countries. Workshops will be held in regions with representatives from&#13;
health care facilities on the agency's operational principles, health economics, financing, computer&#13;
skills and financial reporting.&#13;

BBP. It will include cost-effective interventions to address pressing health care problems. The&#13;
package will reflect state-of-the -art international knowledge as well as specific Armenian conditions.&#13;
A working group, set-up in the MoH will define priorities for public funding based on burden of&#13;
disease, cost-effectiveness of interventions, social significance of certain health problems and private&#13;
affordability. The working group will identify components of the package and its cost. This sub-&#13;
component complements PHC Guidelines Development sub-component which has professional and&#13;
clinical practice focus. The activities will be institutionalized and continued beyond the end of the&#13;
project as core activities of the MoH.&#13;
2.24     The project will finance minor refurbishment of an office for the Working Group, office&#13;
equipment, computer hard and software, foreign and local technical assistance, a long-term fellowship&#13;
in epidemiology and short-term study tours to study comparable experience in developed countries.&#13;
Annual workshops will be held for health care providers for information dissemination and feedback.&#13;
During the negotiations. assurances were obtained from the Government for submission on&#13;
November I each year during the life of the proiect for the IDA 's review Qf the BBP to be included&#13;

cost)&#13;
2.25     Here, the aim is to develop, test and introduce ways to continuously improve providers'&#13;
payment for different levels of health care. A working group will develop and implement&#13;
methodology for cost-accounting and pricing; design a standard format for contracts between agency&#13;
and providers, develop performance monitoring capacity; and a strategy and implementation plan for&#13;
legalizing and regulating private payments to health care providers. The methodology will be tested&#13;
in individual health care institutions and regions before full scale implementation in 1999.&#13;
2.26     The project will finance foreign and local technical assistance, fellowships in health&#13;
economics, two agency staff, short-term overseas training, local training in health financing and cost&#13;
formulation for medical services and contracts. The working group will be based in the SHA and use&#13;
its facilities and computers.&#13;

of the consulting services required for the project in areas such as definition of protocols, BBP&#13;
methodology and health care management information systems and which require very specific&#13;
technical expertise. Most of these contracts will be short term. The Ministry of Health will establish&#13;
a consultant selection committee and contracts will be awarded based on the review of at least three&#13;
candidates. The committee meetings will have detailed minutes justifying the selection of&#13;
consultants. The quarterly report will have a section providing information about procurement of&#13;
consultants and a consultant procurement plan for the next three months. Capacity will be built in&#13;
the PMU in order to handle individual contracts for foreign and local consultants. The supervision of&#13;
civil works under the PHCDP, for maximum amount of US$90,000 will be sole-sourced to ASIF as&#13;

Expenditure for goods and works below US$200,000. Consulting firms contracts under US$ 100,000&#13;
and individual contracts under US$50,000 will be disbursed on the basis of such statements.&#13;
Operating costs of the PMU will also be disbursed under Statements of Expenditure procedures.&#13;
3.20     Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower will maintain a&#13;
Special Account in US dollars in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
The Special Account would be managed by the PMU. The maximum authorized allocation of the&#13;
account would be US$500,000, with an initial allocation to the SA would be limited to US$300,000.&#13;
When aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached US$ 1,000,000, the initial allocation&#13;
may be increased up to the authorized US$500,000 by submitting the relevant Application for&#13;
Withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account will be submitted monthly or&#13;
when a third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever comes first. Documentation requirements&#13;
for replenishments would follow the standard Bank procedures laid down in the Disbursement&#13;
Handbook. Monthly bank statements of the account, reconciled by the Borrower, will accompany all&#13;
replenishment requests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
During negotiations. assurances were obtained from the Government that the Government will&#13;
maintain a Project Account in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA and&#13;
replenish the said account at the beginning of each semester to ensure that adequate funds. as deemed&#13;
necessary by IDA. are available to meet expected local expenditures for the next eight&#13;
months. [para. 6.1. ki&#13;
E.    ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.21     The Borrower will be responsible for appropriate accounting and auditing of the project,&#13;
reporting use of project funds, and ensuring that audits of project accounts are submitted to the Bank.&#13;
The PMU, on behalf of the Borrower, will establish accounting systems to provide information on&#13;
sources and uses of funds in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The PMU will: (a) ensure&#13;
accountability for project funds; (b) maintain records of receipts and disbursements of all funds used&#13;
for the project; (c) maintain internal controls to ensure that receipts and payments are accurately&#13;
recorded in a timely manner, and that assets and liabilities are adequately controlled; (d) report on the&#13;
use of funds; (e) have these reports verified by independent auditors; and (f) provide information, as&#13;
required, to IDA. The PMU will maintain accounts for project funds separately from any other&#13;
existing accounts. Project accounts would be maintained according to International Accounting&#13;
Standards.&#13;
3.22     The PMU will also be responsible, on behalf of the 13orrower, for submitting to the Bank&#13;
annual audits of project accounts no later than six months after the end of each financial year&#13;
(Armenia's financial year is January I - December 31) of project accounts kept at PMU. Records and&#13;
accounts of the project for each fiscal year, including the Special Account, will be audited by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, according to standards and terms of reference satisfactory to&#13;
IDA. Audits will be carried out in accordance with international standards and be undertaken by&#13;
qualified auditors. Audit reports to the Bank will contain separate opinions on: (a) compliance by the&#13;
implementing agencies with relevant covenants of the Credit Agreement with IDA; (b) the Statements&#13;
of Expenditures; and (c) the Special Account. The IDA-required audits would not cover possible&#13;
donor funded activities, even if supervised by the Bank.&#13;
Accounting and reporting arrangements were confirmed during negotiations. [para. 6.1 . b I&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1     The Ministry of Health will be responsible for project implementation. A Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) will be set-up in the Ministry of Health. The Minister (or designated&#13;
Deputy Minister) will provide Government oversight. The main task of the unit will be to provide&#13;
logistical support for implementation. At present, it is in charge of project preparation. New staff&#13;
will be added and trained. Two working groups responsible for preparation of sectoral strategies in&#13;
health financing and primary health care and design of project components will be integrated in the&#13;
project. A Project Steering Committee will be set-up with representatives from key ministerial&#13;
departments directly involved in implementation, as well as representatives of the Ministries of&#13;
Economy, and Finance and the Parliamentary Committee on Health. The PMU will also establish a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
donor consultation committee to improve coordination with other international donors and foreign&#13;
and local NGOs active in the health sector.&#13;
Project Management Unit&#13;
4.2     The PMU will comprise director, an administrative and finance officer, two accountants (for&#13;
the unit and the PHCDP), two project officers to oversee implementation, a procurement specialist&#13;
and an interpreter/secretary. Component and sub-component coordinators will be staff belonging to&#13;
implementing organizations and they will work in cooperation with the unit. The director will also&#13;
serve as the Secretary of the Project Steering Committee and will ensure effective linkage between&#13;
policy development and implementation. The PMU will report to the Steering Committee and be&#13;
responsible for the timely implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the project. Specifically, it&#13;
will: (a) coordinate implementation and ensure that resources are used in accordance with the project&#13;
plan and objectives; (b) monitor implementation and project impact and report to the steering&#13;
committee and IDA; (c) manage procurement, contracting and disbursement; (d) prepare quarterly&#13;
and yearly reports on implementation status; (e) maintain project accounts and ensure timely&#13;
preparation and submission of annual audits; (f) keep coordination between donors and NGOs active&#13;
in the health sector; (g) ensure close coordination with all project stakeholders, in particular the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Economy; and (h) support component coordinators by hiring local and&#13;
international consultants when needed and provide logistical support for project management. Unit&#13;
staff will be recruited through a competitive process. The Head of the PMU was appointed by the&#13;
Minister of Health from a shortlist of candidates acceptable to IDA.&#13;
During the negotiations, assurances were obtained-from the Government for maintaining PMU within&#13;
the MoH with st{of and other resources and terms of reference. acceptable to the IDA. [para. 6. 1.el&#13;
Management of the Primary Health Care Development Program&#13;
4.3     The pilot Primary Health Care Development Program will be managed by a separate small&#13;
unit attached to the PMU. It will be staffed by a program officer, a logistic officer, a promotion&#13;
officer, two appraisal and monitoring officers and an administrative assistant. It will: (a) explain and&#13;
promote the program among health care providers, regional health authorities and communities; (b)&#13;
provide support to communities and health care providers to prepare proposals; (c) appraise proposals&#13;
against selection criteria; (d) coordinate with the Social Investment Fund for the physical&#13;
rehabilitation of the primary health care facilities; (e) present the projects that have been successfully&#13;
appraised to the PHCDP Committee; (f) prepare and sign the framework agreements with the&#13;
communities and health care facilities; (f) procure standard equipment and consumables for selected&#13;
primary health care facilities; (g) monitor micro-project implementation; (h) coordinate with the&#13;
departments in the Ministries and the staff of the regions which will participate in the program; and&#13;
(i) maintain the program accounts and monitor physical progress.&#13;
4.4     A PHCDP committee will supervise and ensure accountability of the program. The&#13;
committee will be chaired by a representative of the Minister of Health and include the head of&#13;
department responsible for adult and maternal and child health, a representative from the regional&#13;
health authorities, two representatives of NGOs active in health care, the head of the PHCDP and the&#13;
Director of the PMU. The Committee will approve the micro project presented by the PHC facilities&#13;
based on the appraisal reports prepared by the PHCDP Unit and review the progress of the program.&#13;
An Operational Manual will guide the program and describe in detail the functions of the Program&#13;
Unit and the Committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Approval of a Final Operational Manual acceptable to IDA will be a condition Qf effectiveness.&#13;
Epara 6.2.al&#13;
During negotiations. assurances were obtained from the Government for maintaining the PHCDP&#13;
nit within the PMU and PHCDP Committee within the MoH which shall follow procedures and&#13;
criteria set forth in the Operational Manual and shall not amend. abrogate or waive any arovision in&#13;
the Operational Manual without a prior consent Qf the IDA.[para. 6. 1 2&#13;
Project Steering Committee&#13;
4.5     The Project Steering Committee, to be chaired by the Minister of Health (or his&#13;
representative), will comprise of the Deputy Minister of Health Reform, Heads of the Departments of&#13;
Health Care and Maternal and Child Health, Head of the Department of Economy, a representative&#13;
from the Ministry of Economy and Finance and Parliamentary Commission on Health. The Project&#13;
Steering Committee will meet at least every quarter to discuss quarterly reports, annual reports, and&#13;
quarterly/yearly work programs. The Project Steering Committee will also meet at the request of the&#13;
Director of the PMU to discuss any outstanding issues relevant to implementation.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government for maintaining a roject&#13;
Steering Committee. which at all tims shlnlude rgnresentatives from the MoH. Ministry Q1&#13;
EcononMv and Finance and the National Assembly Commission on Health. [para. 6.1. iJ&#13;
B.    MONITORING, EVALUATION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.6     Project performance indicators have been developed to systematically monitor project&#13;
progress and evaluate its outcome. The indicators which will serve as a basis for the quarterly reports&#13;
on implementation, cover fiscal impact, improved use of resources, change in access to services, cost&#13;
savings from rationalization programs, client satisfaction and so on. Some indicators will be&#13;
monitored through qualitative and quantitative surveys based on the model of the Social Assessment&#13;
which was successfully conducted during project preparation. The project will finance such surveys&#13;
at mid-term review and at the end of the project. The surveys along with the indicators in the&#13;
performance contracts between PHC facilities and PMU will be the evaluation tools for the pilot&#13;
Primary Health Care Development Program. Other indicators will be monitored through routine&#13;
collection of administrative and financial data.&#13;
4.7     Evaluation of project progress and adoption of necessary corrective actions are important to&#13;
the project, particularly since this is the Bank's first health project in Armenia. Regular project&#13;
progress evaluation activities, as well as a mid-term review (after two years of implementation) will&#13;
be carried out jointly by the Borrower and the Bank.&#13;
During negotiations. assurances were obtained from the Government that the Government will&#13;
furnish on or about October 31. 1999. a report on the Progress achieved during the period preceding&#13;
that date and review the submitted report with the IDA by December 31. 1999. [para. 6. 1.al&#13;
4.8     The proposed project would be supervised by Bank personnel from both headquarters and&#13;
the Bank Resident Mission in Armenia. The project will require extensive supervision by the Bank.&#13;
It is estimated that it would require 25 staff weeks per fiscal year in the two first years and 15 staff-&#13;
weeks per fiscal year thereafter. The lack of experience of the borrower with Bank project&#13;

V.  SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    ANALYSIS OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES&#13;
5.1     Project alternatives were considered in the context of addressing key sector issues and of the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives. Timing, policy context, particular component design,&#13;
presence of and coordination with donors and other World Bank operations were the parameters&#13;
considered in project design.&#13;
Poor health status&#13;
5.2     The current project will emphasize adult health problem through: upgrading primary health&#13;
care services that are expected to improve primary and secondary prevention of non-communicable&#13;
diseases as well as more effective chronic case management; and design of the publicly funded basic&#13;
benefits package to include cost-effective interventions targeted at the main components of Burden of&#13;
Disease.&#13;
5.3     The current project does not address direct public health interventions. Scarce public health&#13;
funds are currently needed to provide access to curative responses to existing Burden of Disease and&#13;
there is the need to demonstrate tangible results and improvements in health system in the short and&#13;
medium term. The main stakeholders have relatively short time horizons and perceived high discount&#13;
rates for the future health benefits. The World Bank, however, intends to use other instruments to&#13;
support development of public health policies targeted at major risk factors. In the Letter of&#13;
Development for the SAC II, the GoA commits itself to develop comprehensive public policy strategy&#13;
to fight smoking, including regulation of advertising, smoke-free public places, public education&#13;
campaigns, etc.&#13;
5.4     The project does not have targeted intervention for maternal and child health, an area which&#13;
has been actively supported by UNICEF and international and national NGOs. It supports, however,&#13;
the integration of UNICEF supported Maternal and Child health services in the PHC structure and&#13;
will monitor essential health indicators. World Bank support for immunization programs was&#13;
discussed during project preparation but assurances were received from the GoA that the programs&#13;
will receive highest priority for public health spending. The project will monitor immunization&#13;
coverage and incidence of vaccine preventable diseases.&#13;
5.5     Long tenn health benefits will also arise from investments in social infrastructure,&#13;
especially development of housing for disadvantaged groups (refugees and earthquake victims), and&#13;
investments in water and sewage systems. The World Bank has completed the Earthquake Zone&#13;
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project and is currently preparing a project addressing water and&#13;
sanitation issues. The Armenia Social Investment Fund under implementation is also looking at these&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Chronic under-funding and low efficiency of health care system&#13;
5.6     Health financing is a clear health sector reform priority in all former socialist economies. A&#13;
mandatory social insurance system has been a politically attractive option, but the GoA has postponed&#13;
plans to introduce compulsory health insurance. This is supported by the World Bank due to the&#13;
current high proportion of the informal economy and related problems with tax collection&#13;
(compliance is estimated at 45%) and also because of the impact it would have on labor costs and&#13;
economic growth. For the short and medium term, the GoA will rely on general revenue for health&#13;
financing. However, there is a strong political constituency in Armenia favoring social insurance and&#13;
it is likely to return to the political agenda as the economic situation improves.&#13;
5.7     The project will establish a public State Health Agency. This option was chosen against an&#13;
alternative to improve the MoH capacity to finance health services because SHA would introduce&#13;
transparent separation between purchaser and provider functions and will allow for broader&#13;
accountability through a Board arrangement. SHA will lead to faster improvement, given the rigidity&#13;
of bureaucracy and political interference; and can easily be transformed into a core institution for a&#13;
successful social health insurance system if so decided in the future; it also enables the MoH to focus&#13;
on regulative functions rather than day-to-day management of finances.&#13;
5.8     The project does not directly address the large and inefficient hospital sector. Instead, it&#13;
will focus on strengthening PHC. In the context of this project, this includes 'traditional' primary&#13;
health care services (vaccination, family planning, etc.) as well as secondary prevention and curative&#13;
services which could be more efficiently provided by outpatient services. Strong PHC capable of&#13;
providing pre- and post-hospital care is a prerequisite for efficient hospitals (the average hospital stay&#13;
in 1995 was 16 days). The GoA plans to introduce a gate-keeping function to PHC providers to&#13;
promote efficiency. One finding of the Social Assessment was that there was general agreement&#13;
among stakeholders that emphasis on primary health care can reduce costs for health care among&#13;
households level and nationally. Limited IDA funding and high political sensitivity are the other&#13;
arguments against an intervention in the hospital sector: US$10 million is perceived to be insufficient&#13;
to have any meaningful impact on the hospital sector.&#13;
5.9     The GoA is committing itself to prepare a strategy for hospital sector rationalization in the&#13;
Letter of Development Policy prepared for the SAC II. SATAC II will support the GoA with&#13;
technical assistance. Health financing reform supported by the project is expected to create favorable&#13;
incentives for restructuring of the hospital sector. A Social Adjustment Credit (SAC III), planned for&#13;
FY 1999, may integrate other measures and allocate funds to implement hospital rationalization. In&#13;
parallel to the IDA project, hospital management training and institutional capacity building for&#13;
policy planning are included in the EU/TACIS project.&#13;
Inequitable access and low qualitv&#13;
5.10     Improving access to health services is a complex task. In Armenia the main determinants&#13;
of access are high out-of-pocket costs, low quality and low public trust in health care providers. The&#13;
GoA strategy to reduce price barriers is to guarantee universal coverage for basic health benefits and&#13;
additional access to vulnerable groups to services also beyond the package. Major altematives to the&#13;
BBP approach are: identifying and fully funding health care facilities for the poor; and introducing&#13;
and regulating across-the-board co-payments. The "Hospitals for the Poor" option was dropped&#13;
because of political unpopularity of an explicit two-tier health care system, need for a transition&#13;
period from the former political declaration of free health care to limited public responsibility and&#13;
difficulties in identifying the genuinely poor. The Govemment, however, is considering allocating a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
hospital to be managed by an NGO to provide services for the poor using the NGO screening&#13;
procedures. This hospital(s) would serve as safety net during the transition period of moving towards&#13;
sustainable BBP. The need to legalize co-payments is being addressed in the GoA health financing&#13;
reform and will occur alongside the implementation of the current project.&#13;
5.11     In developed countries, the quality of inputs (sufficient recurrent funding, investments) has&#13;
generally been achieved and the focus is on improving the process. Both inputs and process need to&#13;
be improved concurrently for poor and middle income countries. Hence, the project's emphasis is on&#13;
investment in infrastructure, equipment, training for PHC providers, development of practice&#13;
protocols and managerial skills to improve provision of care. PHC focus was chosen over specialist&#13;
and hospital sector because: it will have impact on more users (0.08 hospital visits vs. 5 outpatient&#13;
visits per capita); PHC proximity to the population and community ownership; the need for a more&#13;
balanced approach to health care in a system strongly biased towards hospital and specialist; recurrent&#13;
expenditures needed to sustain PHC investments are lower than investments for the hospital sector.&#13;
5.12     The project does not formally address the need to improve voluntary risk-pooling&#13;
(insurance). Increased community participation and ownership, however, may lead to risk pooling at&#13;
the community level.&#13;
B.    FiSCAL IMPACT AND PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.13     Public spending on health. Public funding for health care will be limited in the medium&#13;
and long term even using optimistic estimate for economic growth and Government spending. 17&#13;
Projected public sector health care expenditures will be about US$120 million by 2005 or US$17.6&#13;
per capita in 1997 dollars compared to US$6.75 in 1997 (Table 5.1). The implication of such&#13;
projections are two-fold: BBP will continue to be an important instrument for the Government to&#13;
prioritize health care spending and the emphasis should be placed on increased efficiency and service&#13;
rationalization.&#13;

5.14     Sustainability of Basic Benefits Packane The Government aims to improve efficiency and&#13;
equity of the health care system by concentrating limited financing on the basic package of essential&#13;
17    "Public Expenditures in Armenia: Strategic Spending for Creditworthiness and Growth (World Bank&#13;
report, draft, 1997).&#13;

public health and clinical services free of charge to all and additional services free of charge to&#13;
children and vulnerable groups. As the MoH tries to maintain comprehensive coverage and extensive&#13;
scope of essential services, the BBP is currently not sustainable. In 1997, with per capita financing of&#13;
US$6.75 for health care, GoA intends to cover about 40% of all hospitalizations and provide a&#13;
comprehensive range of outpatient services for about US$1.5 per capita. According to cost studies&#13;
done by the MoH working group, reimbursement is 2-3 times lower than cost. This forces the system&#13;
to continue to rely on informal private payments for all services. Technically, the current BBP is&#13;
inefficient, for example, BoD results suggest that it is not based on the current epidemiological profile&#13;
of Armenia, e.g. including services with high per saved DALY costs such as hemodialysis;&#13;
intervention standards are inefficient, for instance long hospital stays for tuberculosis and sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases; categories of services included in the BBP are not clearly defined; and the&#13;
number of beneficiaries receiving free full coverage of health care services needs to be reduced. The&#13;
project team believes that there is strong Government commitment exists to improve credibility of the&#13;
package. A sub-component of the current project is designed to improve its efficiency and&#13;
sustainability. This is also a SAC 1I condition.&#13;
5.15      Restructuring of health services. Over-capacity of hospital infrastructure compounded with&#13;
scarce financial resources prompts for the need of restructuring of the hospital sector. The&#13;
Government is reluctant to use&#13;
administrative methods and hopes that           8000&#13;
financial incentives of the health financing&#13;
reform will induce efficiency                   7000 .&#13;
improvements. As a parallel mechanism,          6000&#13;
the Government has decided to privatize&#13;
eight specialty care hospitals in 1997. In      5000&#13;
1996, the public financing of the above         4000&#13;
hospitals amounted for US$560,000, or                                 _&#13;
about 2% of total Government health             3000&#13;
expenditures. These funds could be partly       2000&#13;
reallocated to support essential services in                   L            / &#13;

36%, surgeon by 23%, and other specialists by 30%. At the same time, a GP needs a consultation of&#13;
ENT in 16%, ophthalmologist in 10%, surgeon and dermatologist in 9%, and neurologist in 8% of&#13;
cases, which is significantly less compared to a current district physician workload. Implementing&#13;
PHC strategy should result in net decrease of the number of practicing physicians by about 14%.&#13;
5.17     Recurrent expenditures The project will generate recurrent spending estimated at US$2&#13;
million. Roughly US$130,000 is incremental cost generated by investment in PHC infrastructure.&#13;
These incremental costs will maintain quality standards of the service. Neglected preventive&#13;
maintenance is one of the main reasons for deteriorated infrastructure and low quality of health care&#13;
services. It is expected that these incremental costs will be covered through official payments for&#13;
non-BBP services and community contributions. According to the design of the PHCDP,&#13;
communities commitment to sustaining investments in health facilities will be a selection criterion.&#13;
As grant allocation is demand driven, committed funds by communities will have politically&#13;
acceptable opportunity costs. The project will support the communities and PHC teams in developing&#13;
sustainability plans.&#13;
5.18     The State Health Agency will generate incremental recurrent expenditure estimated at&#13;
US$175,000 a year, related to information system maintenance and staff hired from outside&#13;
Government. It is expected, however, that this incremental staff will be drawn from other public&#13;
enterprises and hired on fixed term contracts. The staff will have to acquire new skills necessary for&#13;
the agency. The incremental costs are expected to be offset by health financing efficiency gains.&#13;
Operating costs related to project activities in NIH, SMU and Medical College will be covered&#13;
through savings from restructuring of their organization due to reduced enrollment and re-organized&#13;
specialist training.&#13;
C.    INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY ANALYSIS AND&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK OPERATIONS IN ARMENIA&#13;
5.19     In Armenia, institutional capacity to implement health sector reform, manage projects and&#13;
administer health care systems in the new socio-economic environment is limited. But, the situation&#13;
has been improving steadily. The public health and health administration program of the American&#13;
University of Armenia, health projects of NGOs and diaspora the presence of UNICEF, foreign&#13;
technical assistance supporting MoH working groups have all contributed to the emergence of&#13;
professional trained and experienced in public health and project management. Many Armenians&#13;
have excellent skills in sciences and technology. These people constitute a resource that will be used&#13;
during implementation.&#13;
5.20     Administrative capacity within the health system needs to be improved. Functions and&#13;
responsibilities of regional and municipal health authorities are still being defined, and management&#13;
skills for autonomous health facility managers still need to be developed. The EU/TACIS technical&#13;
assistance project is expected to develop institutional capacity. It will improve capacity in health care&#13;
financing and support selected communities in developing management skills. The positive&#13;
experience with the Armenia Social Investment Fund reveals that with adequate incentives,&#13;
communities can be extremely effective agents of change. The SIF experience has been used to&#13;
develop the PHC Development Program.&#13;
5.21     Armenia has one IBRD and seven IDA projects under implementation: energy, housing,&#13;
transport, agriculture, social, and private sector development. Experience from implementation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
recent IDA projects shows that the Government can administer and implement a project in a&#13;
satisfactory manner and within an agreed timetable. The key to success are careful selection of PMU&#13;
staff of the PMU and training in Bank procurement procedures and accounting. The Ministry of&#13;
Health has some experience with international organizations. It has worked with UNICEF on&#13;
immunization and Maternal and Child health programs, coordination of substantial humanitarian&#13;
assistance and support from a wide range of diaspora. The World Bank project will be the largest&#13;
single project that the MoH will implement. Currently, the MoH is implementing a PHRD grant for&#13;
project preparation, effective since November 1996. The Project Preparation Unit, operational in the&#13;
MoH since 1996, has managed the PHRD in a timely and satisfactory manner. The staff of PPU has&#13;
received assistance to set up its accounting system from the Armenia Highway Project PMU.&#13;
5.22     Lessons learned from the World Bank health sector lending in the ECA region are: (a)&#13;
expectations for reform have been too optimistic for both the World Bank and client countries; (b)&#13;
institutional aspects of reform are as important as technically proficient strategies; (c) greater&#13;
attention needs to be paid to the political economy of reform; (d) projects have been too complex; and&#13;
(e) adequate resources need to be committed to supervision of projects. The institutional aspects of&#13;
this project are designed to allow for sufficient time to build up capacity before taking on full&#13;
functions and raising expectations. The SHA will have a year to train staff, develop procedures and&#13;
test them through pilots before assuming full responsibility of managing public health funds.&#13;
Similarly, NIH, SMU and Medical College will build up capacity for a year before admitting students.&#13;
The project has a relatively simple design of only two components. The complexity of the PHC&#13;
Development Program is expected to be manageable.&#13;
D.    SOCIAL ASSESSMENT AND STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION&#13;
5.23     A Social Assessment was conducted during project preparation. The assessment included:&#13;
a household survey, focus groups of community members and interviews with service providers. The&#13;
assessment focused on utilization, access and satisfaction with health services. Results contributed to&#13;
the sector analysis and project design. The assessment also established that there was not enough&#13;
information on health reform among the population, communities and health care providers.&#13;
5.24     The vehicles for stakeholder participation in health care reform and project design were:&#13;
two broad based working groups established by the Ministry of Health; a national workshop on health&#13;
care reform for key stakeholders; field visits and consultations by the project team; and consultation&#13;
with Armenian NGOs. The working groups included representatives from Ministry of Health,&#13;
Ministry of Finance, State Medical University, National Institute of Health, Medical College, private&#13;
health sector and regional health authorities. The groups were supported by external technical&#13;
expertise and were the principal authors of project design. The national and regional workshops,&#13;
supported by the World Bank, brought together about 80 representatives from all levels of health care&#13;
administration and provision. Feedback from the conference confirmed once again the importance of&#13;
information dissemination and consultation for the success of health care reform.&#13;
5.25     The health financing working group will be integrated in project implementation. The&#13;
project will also allocate resources (estimated at US$250,000 base cost) for continuing public&#13;
information and consultation process. UNDP will support the campaign with a US$150,000 grant.&#13;
The Social Assessment will be repeated as part of the mid-term review and at the end of the project to&#13;
monitor performance and impact of the project and receive feedback for improving implementation.&#13;

E.    BENEFITS AND RisKs&#13;
5.26         Benefits. More efficient public health spending will improve the sustainability of the basic&#13;
benefits package in providing access to basic health care services to the people. The poorer segments&#13;
of the population are more likely to benefit from improved targeting. Improving transparency and&#13;
introducing appropriate incentives will create an enabling environment for restructuring the large and&#13;
inefficient health sector. The communities eligible for PHC development grants will benefit from&#13;
improved access to better quality health services, increased sense of ownership and improvement in&#13;
their capacity to manage community affairs. Primary health care providers will benefit through&#13;
strengthening their skills, increasing professional prestige and job satisfaction from improved&#13;
practice. The PHCDP will also create employment opportunities for small scale contractors.&#13;
5.27         Ministry of Health will benefit from  improved institutional capacity to manage public&#13;
funds for health care. State Medical University, National Institute of Health and Medical College will&#13;
benefit from improved institutional capacity and links to international professional community.&#13;
5.28         Risks. The Government faces certain risks in implementing its reform  program  as well as&#13;
the project. The risks and mitigation measures for the project are summarized (Table 5.2).&#13;

H.   POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
The project will have no direct and targeted impact on the poor because of difficulties in identifying&#13;
the poor. The project is expected, however, to better benefit the poor through: (i) The design of the&#13;
BBP which will emphasize health services important for the poor, including immunization,&#13;
tuberculosis, prenatal care, school health programs and emergency services; (ii) Improving quality&#13;
and access to primary health care services in selected communities: outpatient services are closer to&#13;
the population (no transport cost) and considerably cheaper in terms of informal out of pocket&#13;
payments, and although efforts are being made to gradually eliminate informal payments, it will only&#13;
be achieved in the medium to long term; and, (iii) improving efficiency of public health expenditures&#13;
in the short term will enable improvement of the sustainability of the BBP and reduce out-of-pocket&#13;
costs and in the longer term, enlarge the scope of the package.&#13;

5.29        The project does not have a negative environmental impact and has been assigned&#13;
environmental category C.&#13;

1. The Concept of Primary Health Care (PHC)&#13;
1.1 The definition of PHC&#13;
The development of a PHC strategy, within the context of health care system reforms in the&#13;
Republic of Armenia (RA), is based on the PHC concept adopted at the Alma-Ata conference&#13;
in 1978.&#13;
According to the WHO definition, " Primary Health Care is the main part of health care, based&#13;
on scientific, practical methods accessible for the population, and is implemented at a cost the&#13;
country and community can afford. PHC is the central function of the State Health Care&#13;
System, the principal vehicle for the delivery of health care, the most peripheral level in a&#13;
health system stretching from the periphery to the center, and an integral part of the social and&#13;
economic development of a country " (1994 Copenhagen, WHO Glossary).&#13;
In the RA, PHC, as "the first contact zone between a person/family and the health care system,&#13;
is the basis for the health care system and an integral part of it, aiming to satisfy the main&#13;
medical-social needs of the population using a limited amount of simple and inexpensive&#13;
medical technologies, with an emphasis on preventive activities; special attention is focused on&#13;
accessibility and equity, integration of services, participation of the community and&#13;
intersectoral coordination."&#13;
1.2. The Tasks of PHC&#13;
* Promotion of health&#13;
* Prevention of disease&#13;
* Treatment of disease&#13;
* Rehabilitation&#13;
1. 3. The Main Principles of PHC Implementation&#13;
ACCESSIBILITY              Geographic, time, psycho-social and financial;&#13;
evaluation of accessibility is based on public&#13;
opinion.&#13;
EQUITY                     It is impossible to attain equality in health status for&#13;
everybody. It is, however, necessary to provide equal&#13;
opportunityfor all individuals to realize theirfull health&#13;
potential.&#13;
COMPREHENSIVENESS   The broad range of services offered satisfies the main health&#13;
care needs of the population (although the final solution to&#13;
any given health care problem may not be realized at the PHC&#13;
level).&#13;
CONTINUITY                 PHC addresses not the treatment of a special case, but the&#13;
whole range of health care issues arising during an&#13;
individual's lifetime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
COORDINATION                  The majority of health care issues faced by an individual are&#13;
addressed at the PHC level. The individual, however, can&#13;
receive additional specialized medical care, coordinated&#13;
through his/herfamily doctor. Centralizedpatientfiles would&#13;
ensure an efficient coordination process.&#13;
2. PHC in the Armenian Context&#13;
The primary reason for health care reform in the RA is the fact that PHC, although present, has&#13;
many shortcomings at the organizational level. These include:&#13;
*  an insufficient level of preventive measures;&#13;
*  the low  level of authority of the district therapeutist, and his/her passive role as a&#13;
"dispatcher"/controller (In the past, emphasis was placed on specialized and hospital&#13;
services. In order to ensure maximum occupancy rates for hospital beds, the district&#13;
therapeutist was persuaded to refer patients to in-patient care and testing. As a result, the&#13;
district therapeutist was deprived of his/her main function of providing patients with&#13;
services);&#13;
*  lack of consideration of the family as a unit with regards to health care provision, resulting&#13;
in a separation of therapeutic, pediatric and obstetrical-gynecological services;&#13;
*  the absence of financial incentives to develop activities; and&#13;
*  insufficient capacity building.&#13;
As a result, the system  is inefficient, and the quality of services is insufficient. Health&#13;
indicators in the RA are currently lower than international standards.&#13;
The need for PHC reform is obvious. The main goal of this reform is to improve the health of&#13;
the population, through:&#13;
*  the provision of high quality health care;&#13;
*  the organization of more effective and efficient health services;&#13;
*  greater emphasis on health promotion and preventive measures;&#13;
*  a partial shift of the health care burden from the hospitals to the PHC units, i.e. from more&#13;
expensive to more cost-effective medical care;&#13;
*  increased accessibility of medical care by the introduction of a "family medicine"&#13;
approach;&#13;
*  a "gate keeper" role for the family doctor;&#13;
*  financial motivations for doctors to provide a better service;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;

* continuous examination and follow-up of the patient;&#13;
*  coordination between the PHC providers' services and secondary health care services.&#13;
3. Services that will be Provided by the Armenian PHC Team&#13;
*  Health education&#13;
*  Maternal and child health care programs, including immunization and family planning&#13;
*  Prevention and control of endemic diseases&#13;
*  Identification of the social, environmental, demographic, and psychological risk factors for&#13;
disease, and development of preventive measures directed towards health promotion for the&#13;
population&#13;
*  Diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation for health care problems&#13;
*  Medical assistance in emergency situations&#13;
*  Social services&#13;
4. Providers of PHC in Armenian&#13;
The PHC medical services in Armenia will be provided by the PHC team. During the&#13;
transition period the PHC team will consist of the following providers: family doctor/general&#13;
practitioner, general practice pediatrician, general practice nurse, midwife. In the future, in&#13;
connection with the development of the social and economic conditions of the Republic, the&#13;
team members can be reviewed and changed.&#13;
5. Organization and Management of the PHC Sector in the Health Care System&#13;
S.1 The types of ownership&#13;
Medical facilities providing primary health care services will be owned by hamainks&#13;
(communities). At present these facilities belong to marzes (regions) and will be transferred to&#13;
hamainks when the State Health Agency (SHA) begins to function. Transfer of PHC facilities&#13;
to hamaink ownership will be carried out gradually. Priority will be given to hamainks that will&#13;
invest in the development of these facilities. Several hamainks can join together to own a&#13;
single PHC facility. In this case, the same team of family doctors will provide services&#13;
addressing the health needs of the entire population in the associated hamainks.&#13;
Hamaink ownership of PHC facilities will stimulate hamaink participation in both facility-&#13;
related activities, and the refurbishing and renovation of the PHC facilities.&#13;
Family doctor services can also be provided on a private basis.&#13;

*  Organize the construction, maintenance and utilization of facilities at the hamaink level.&#13;
5.3 The Active Participation of the Community in the Organization of PHC&#13;
Community members are not only the consumers of PHC services, but can also be active&#13;
participants in its organization, implementation and monitoring in the following ways:&#13;
consultation with program users; control of results; participation of users in service provision;&#13;
development of proposals for improving the health of different social groups (elderly people,&#13;
socially vulnerable groups, chronically ill patients, etc.) based on needs assessment survey&#13;
data.&#13;
There is some uncertainty regarding the regulations and management structure at the hamaink&#13;
level. Consequently, the active participation of community members in PHC is not yet clear.&#13;
5.4 Financing of PHC&#13;
The PHC providers' team will contract with the SHA according to which services will be&#13;
provided within the framework of the BBP. The SHA will implement quality assurance&#13;
monitoring for the services provided. Payment for these services will be carried out according&#13;
to the principle of capitation.&#13;
In facilities which meet certain criteria, the family doctor, along with his/her team, will provide&#13;
PHC services directed towards the promotion of health and treatment of diseases for the&#13;
population. Concurrently, the family doctor will act as the financial and logistic manager of the&#13;
team. All members of each team should act within the same administrative managerial unit.&#13;
In urban areas, former polyclinics can be used as family doctors' offices. Each polyclinic will&#13;
be allocated some family doctor teams, and provide these teams with appropriate laboratory,&#13;
diagnostic, X-ray and other services in common facilities. The logistics of the teams' activities&#13;
will be the responsibility of the manager, who will be appointed by the owner of each PHC&#13;
facility. The manager will also contract with the SHA regarding services implemented by teams&#13;
within the framework of the State Order. Team members will be paid via contracts with the&#13;
manager from the sources allocated for them by the Government. The manager will be&#13;
accountable to a council for his/her activities. The council will be made up of family doctors.&#13;
PHC teams will be given the opportunity to work independent from the polyclinics and&#13;
establish private offices.&#13;
In rural areas, family doctors' teams will be located mainly at ambulatory clinics. The family&#13;
doctor will be the manager of the team. The team will contract directly with the marz branch of&#13;
the SHA.&#13;
Diagnostic laboratories and medical specialists will be paid for services according to separate&#13;
contracts with the SHA based on reports from family doctor's team members.&#13;
For services outside the National Health Care System, the patient will pay himself, on the basis&#13;
of a fee-for-service system.&#13;

6. Reform of the PHC System&#13;
6.1 PHC Providers - Present Infrastructure&#13;
There is a high number of potential PHC providers in all marz areas of the RA. In urban areas&#13;
they are mainly employed at polyclinics, based on district (or territorial) health services&#13;
provision. These providers are separate for adults and children. In addition to the therapeutist&#13;
and pediatrician, the polyclinic staff is comprised of doctors of various specialties&#13;
(cardiologists, neurologists, surgeons, etc.).&#13;
In rural areas PHC providers are employed at Rural Health Centers (RHC) and Feldsher&#13;
Obstetrical Units (FOU) . These facilities serve as separate stages of health provision for the&#13;
rural inhabitants. FOUs are more peripheral establishments, and employ feldshers (medical&#13;
personnel with a four-year education from special medical colleges) and a midwife. The RHC&#13;
is the main medical establishment in the rural area which, according to legislation, should have&#13;
four doctors (therapeutist, pediatrician, obstetrician-gynecologist and dentist). In addition to&#13;
these establishments, the rural population can also use the wide range of services provided by&#13;
the local hospitals, which have a capacity of approximately 25-30 beds.&#13;
RHCs, according to Governmental decision, have State Enterprise Status. This status allows the&#13;
RHC the opportunity to carry out activities which will build a foundation of necessary&#13;
financial resources that may result in a more efficient and rational implementation of medical&#13;
activities.&#13;
The distribution of doctors in the RA is unequal.&#13;
6.2 Transition Activities&#13;
6.2.1 Health care, social welfare and other relevant services will be reoriented in order to&#13;
obtain maximum fulfillment from the activities of the family doctor. These activities will be&#13;
directed towards solving the health problems of the family through community health&#13;
promotion, disease prevention and treatment, rehabilitation and social assistance.&#13;
6.2.2 New approaches will be developed for the selection and distribution of health care&#13;
providers. By optimizing the system, resources will become available that can be used for&#13;
strengthening the PHC system according to need and demand. This process will also involve&#13;
training programs in family practice medicine designed for doctors from different specialties to&#13;
become family doctors. Additionally, PHC facilities will be provided with essential drugs,&#13;
diagnostic and other necessary equipment.&#13;
To ensure the efficiency of PHC activities, it is necessary to work out a rationalization plan for&#13;
the units that provide services (for example, the establishment of PHC facilities where&#13;
needed; in the case of underutilized rural district hospitals, to reconstruct them into out-patient&#13;
facilities or to join them to the marz hospitals).&#13;
In the future, it is planned to transform a certain number of FOUs into offices for family&#13;
doctors. The remaining FOUs will be preserved, staffed by one public nurse. They will be&#13;
responsible for answering health-related questions from the population of the hamainkcs, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;
Page 9 of 12&#13;
accountable to the family doctor. FOUs will provide some team services, ensuring a greater&#13;
accessibility to services for the population of each hamaink. The staff of FOUs will be paid&#13;
from the budget allocated for hamaink health care. Hamainks will also participate in ensuring&#13;
the ongoing activities of FOUs.&#13;
6.2.3 With the aim of utilizing the limited national resources for medical assistance in a more&#13;
effective and equitable way, these resources will be pooled together to finance the minimal&#13;
Basic Benefits Package (BBP), which will be provided free of charge to the entire population in&#13;
the RA.&#13;
The basis for the BBP will be the burden of disease in the RA, and the cost-effectiveness of the&#13;
interventions.&#13;
6.2.4 A rational system for estimating and evaluating the economic cost of the health care&#13;
system will be developed and implemented. The aim of the system will be to set up a direct&#13;
link between the PHC providers' reimbursement and indicators of consumers' health.&#13;
6.2.5 PHC providers will be given training, re-training and continuous education.&#13;
6.2.6 An increase in burden of responsibility will be placed on the person, family and&#13;
community for their own health.&#13;
6.2.7 Standards will be developed for PHC services.&#13;
6.2.8 Standards will be developed for the physical infrastructure of PHC units.&#13;
6.2.9 A stage-by-stage implementation plan for the introduction of family practice will be&#13;
followed (see Annex).&#13;
Taking into account the variety in PHC infrastructure present in different marzes, it is obvious&#13;
that introduction of family practice in each marz should be implemented in the most optimal&#13;
way for the particular situation. Nevertheless, a number of common organizational aspects can&#13;
be identified.&#13;
*  Certain medical services currently provided by different specialists can be delegated to the&#13;
family doctor. The specialists will be limited to the consultation and treatment of patients&#13;
who need very specialized care due to complicated pathology or chronic diseases. This&#13;
will result in a reduction of specialists at the primary level and, consequently, will free&#13;
resources.&#13;
*  Certain medical activities (preventive, out-patient, patient follow-up) that are currently&#13;
performed by doctors can be delegated to medical mid-level staff who have received&#13;
special professional education and are eligible to work independently in providing these&#13;
medical services. This will result in a decreased demand for physician services. The ratio&#13;
of doctors to mid-level personnel in the RA is 1:2.5 , though 1:4 is considered to be more&#13;
optimal.&#13;
*  Family doctors and general practice pediatricians are the only doctors who will have&#13;
complete responsibility for the promotion of the patient's health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;
Page 10 of 12&#13;
*  The hamaink will be responsible for providing the conditions necessary for the&#13;
implementation of PHC services. Hamaink authorities will ensure the planning and&#13;
organization of PHC activities in their district through the officials responsible for health&#13;
care.&#13;
*  Although family doctors can be located in any medical institution, polyclinics (in urban&#13;
areas) and RHCs (in rural areas) are considered to be a more appropriate choice. In the&#13;
near future family doctors may also be practicing at private facilities.&#13;
7. Integration of vertical programs&#13;
At present, several vertical programs (diarrhea, respiratory diseases, tuberculosis program, etc.)&#13;
are implemented concurrently with PHC at all levels of the health care system. The majority of&#13;
these vertical program activities will be transferred to family practice. Several sanitary-&#13;
epidemiological programs will remain as vertical programs.&#13;

Page 11 of 12&#13;
Appendix: Strategy for the Introduction of Family Practice&#13;
Short-term strategy (Jan 1997 - Dec 1997); This time period is the preparation stage.&#13;
Activities will include the following:&#13;
*  development of an organizational-legislative base for the transition to family doctor&#13;
practice;&#13;
*  extended analysis of PHC services in the RA health care system; detailing a precise&#13;
program for the transition to family medicine; development of the mechanisms for&#13;
management and capacity building at each marz;&#13;
*  selection of PHC providers to work in the sphere of family practice; organization of their&#13;
training and re-training;&#13;
* preparation of training programs;&#13;
*  improvement of programs in family practice training, increased information, and other&#13;
activities for the purpose of ensuring the authority of the family doctor;&#13;
*  provision of information on reforms to raise awareness among medical staff and the&#13;
population;&#13;
*  development of incentives for PHC providers, especially in rural areas;&#13;
*  development of a computerized information system network for family doctors;&#13;
*  development of mechanisms for the introduction of the next 2 stages.&#13;
M-d-term  strategy (1998 - 2000) This is the transition stage towards the introduction of&#13;
family practice. The main goal of this stage is the transition of district therapeutic and&#13;
pediatric services to the corresponding family practice services.&#13;
Structural and functional changes will occur at this stage. In addition, PHC teams will be&#13;
recruited within the limits of existing possibilities.&#13;
Increase in the authority of family doctors will be achieved through an increase of salary and&#13;
responsibility, and through the provision of adequate medical supplies and equipment,&#13;
premises.&#13;
Individuals will be give a choice in the selection of PHC providers (family doctor with his/her&#13;
team). If necessary, a consultation with an obstetrician-gynecologist and other specialists, or&#13;
in-patient treatment will be provided. It will be essential that a patient be referred by a family&#13;
doctor for consultations with specialists.&#13;
The activities of the PHC team will be implemented in polyclinics (for urban areas) and health&#13;
centers or rural hospitals (for rural areas). In order to achieve this, and also to ensure family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;
Page 12 of 12&#13;
doctor, specialist-consultant, diagnostic and rehabilitation services, necessary changes in&#13;
management structure and organization will be made.&#13;
Thus, the final results of this stage are.:&#13;
1. The development of the principles of PHC organization at each marz.&#13;
2. The development of regulations which reflect PHC providers' (family doctor, general&#13;
practice pediatrician, general practice nurse, midwife and other providers') rights and&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
3. The development of procedures and methodology to ensure links between PHC and other&#13;
providers' medical and social assistance.&#13;
4. The development of procedures and methodology for the conduct of daily activities and&#13;
quality assurance monitoring.&#13;
Long-term strategy (2000 - ) This is the final transition stage for the introduction of family&#13;
practice. The aim of this stage is the further development of family practice medicine and the&#13;
final transition into family-oriented PHC.&#13;

STATEMENT OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE STRATEGY&#13;
OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA&#13;
1. Health System Reforms in the Republic of Armenia: Introduction&#13;
The Government of Armenia has defined basic foundations for major reforms in the&#13;
health care system. These reforms are described in the elaborated in 1995 by the Ministry&#13;
of Health "Program on Development and Reforms of the Health Care System in the&#13;
Republic of Armenia for 1996-2000", the legislative basis provided for which has&#13;
become the "Law on Medical Aid and Services to the Population", adopted in 1996. The&#13;
reforms include diversification of the health care system financing, reorientation of the&#13;
system towards primary health care, improvement and updating of medical education.&#13;
Introduction of licensing for professional activities, and structural changes of the system&#13;
such as the decentralization of the management and financing systems, privatization and&#13;
denationalization of some facilities, and significant improvement of the information&#13;
analytical system. Strengthening primary health care and improving the health care&#13;
financing mechanisms in Armenia are the two main directions of the reforms. The&#13;
Government is preparing a separate primary health care strategy draft. Our strategy for&#13;
reforming the health financing system of the republic of Armenia is presented below.&#13;
Health Care Financing&#13;
2. According to approximate estimations about 41 billion drams, or 11,000 drams per&#13;
capita, was spent on health care in the Republic of Armenia in 1995. Approximately&#13;
twenty-five percent - 10.1 billion drams - came from the state budget. According to the&#13;
same estimations the sufficient part of the expenditures was made directly by the&#13;
population, including informal out-of-pocket payments. The amount of public funding for&#13;
health, though on a small scale, has been increasing in both absolute and relative terms,&#13;
reflecting our commitment to the health sector. In 1996, the public health expenditures&#13;
are expected to reach 13 billion drams in 1997 are budgeted at 15.7 billion drams. In the&#13;
short term, the Government will continue to rely upon the state budget to finance the&#13;
State Health Target Program till abstaining from introduction of a new, health payroll tax.&#13;
However, the question of introduction of compulsory health insurance will be kept in the&#13;
agenda and can become an issue for discussion alongside with the improvement of&#13;
general economic situation.&#13;
3. Along with increasing total spending in health, the Government is also committed to&#13;
allocating increasingly large share to primary health care financing. In the 1997 budget,&#13;
allocations for one of the most important sectors of primary health care - outpatient-&#13;
policlinic service - in comparison with the last year, will be increased by more than 36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX3&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
percent, from 1.8 billion drams to 2.45 billion drams. Other important public health&#13;
programs will receive priority in the frames of the overall health budget.&#13;
4. The state is not the only actor responsible for public health care. Citizens also have&#13;
their own responsibility for health and health expenses. The state will remain responsible&#13;
for essential service within its limited financial capacities. The Government will also&#13;
attempt to improve the efficiency of the sizable non-public spending by using several&#13;
approaches described below in the portion on non-public sources of financing.&#13;
5. Health Care Public Financing Strategy&#13;
The Government objectives for state health financing over the next years are to ensure&#13;
universal access to essential health care services while introducing appropriate financial&#13;
incentives and ensuring fiscal sustainability of the State Health Agency. The Government&#13;
will focus its efforts on the following main issues:&#13;
1) creation of the State Health Agency&#13;
2) completion of the transformation process of health institutions into state enterprises&#13;
3) definition of a Basic Benefits Package to be included in the State Target Health&#13;
Program&#13;
4) ensuring medical assistance to the most vulnerable groups of population by improved&#13;
equity and better targeting of public spending&#13;
5) elaboration and adoption of new payment mechanisms for health care providers&#13;
6) improvement of the financial information system&#13;
6. Creation of the State Health Agency&#13;
It is necessary to separate the health care provision and the health care financing&#13;
functions in order to improve the efficiency of the Armenian health care system. To this&#13;
effect, the Government plans to establish a separate body for purchasing health care&#13;
services - the State Health Agency. Within the State Target Programs the Agency will&#13;
have the following tasks:&#13;
1) contracting with health care providers&#13;
2) paying providers&#13;
3) monitoring the quality and contents of services.&#13;
Important functions such as setting overall health policy as well as defining the Basic&#13;
Benefits Package would remain the responsibility of the Government. The non-&#13;
governmental health care providers will have equal rights with the state enterprises in&#13;
contracting the agency. The State Agency will not be obliged to enter into agreement with&#13;
all health care providers. The government will elaborate certain criteria for health care&#13;
institutions selection, which would be considered by the Agency when signing&#13;
agreements. The State Health Agency could be transferred to become a social insurance&#13;
fund in the future, when the Government will resolute to implement compulsory health&#13;
insurance. The Government will define the legal basis and the administrative and&#13;

organizational structure of the Agency and launch its icti x i ties during the first year of&#13;
project implementation&#13;
7. Structural Changes and D)ecentralization&#13;
An important element of the Armenian health financti ret )rms appears the granting of&#13;
state enterprise status to the budget institutiolls State ent ~rprise no lo'nger receive per&#13;
item budget allocation based on capacity, hut instead ire paid by the volurme of services&#13;
they produce and have more freedonm to manage theii h\ ' l nudgct. Xl present most of&#13;
both Republican and mnarz health care t'acilities ha\ e tire idy obtained state enterprise&#13;
status. This process will he continued and finished dcurinl 1 997 At the same time out-&#13;
patient and polyclinic institutions have obtained the sxatu ofI legal entities and no longer&#13;
are under the administrative authority of hospitals. Giver tht large nuLmber of health care&#13;
institutions in Armenia, the Government is not sure that iTi state enterprises will be&#13;
financially viable under this new budgeting system. At tf e same tinme, in order to make&#13;
the bulk of the system and the personnel correspond tt i1- e real demand, the Government&#13;
intends to elaborate a program for reformation and chang ing the scope of'activities of the&#13;
low-efficient health care institutions, as well as for closir g of a parn of them. The&#13;
Government will not promote the enterprises sufftered as lresult of a competition, except&#13;
for those which implement specific tasks within the Statt I arget Health Programs, or&#13;
those which are fundamental in providing accessible hea Ih care ser\ ices and ensuring&#13;
homogeneous geographic distribution. The stafft' f tht ht althi care institutions which is&#13;
subject to closing will be retrained to become mostlx gereral practitioners, and the&#13;
facilities of those institutions will he redistributed tfor I !1 r  rt efficient provision of health&#13;
care services. Along with establishment statt enterpri hen~ the (jovernment is committed to&#13;
implement decentralization of the health care system nai iagenmenit t the marz and local&#13;
(hamaink) level, as well as to continue the programmed privatization of health care&#13;
institutions, considering those steps an importanit parl v' estructuring, taking into account&#13;
all the positive and negative features of the process a, k\ t 11 as the necessity to implement&#13;
it carefully.&#13;
8. Basic Benefits Package&#13;
According to the "Law on Medical Aid and Services ro t ie Population" (1996), within the&#13;
framework of the State 'Farget f-lealth Program,. pro% sit 1a v a limited package of&#13;
essential clinical services (the basic benefits package  1B 1P). financ ed from the state&#13;
budget, is guaranteed for the population. Fhi oheti ct  ) inplemetiLing the BBP is to&#13;
first finance those services which will have ihe greatest i npact on improving the health&#13;
status of our population within the limited public huLd,.et I he content ot' the BBP should&#13;
be later revised and its methodology should he seriously refined by lirst assessing the&#13;
burden of disease in Armenia in order to quantitatively e .aluate heallh priorities. In&#13;
improving the BBP methodology the Government will g ve priorit\ to the issue of using&#13;
the present limited financial resources in the most efficierl way, considering both the&#13;
medical and economic effectiveness of the services inclu led in the IIBP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
9. Guaranteed Medical Assistance to the Vulnerable Groups of Population&#13;
Equity and solidarity are important concepts in Armenian health care reform. Therefore,&#13;
the Government will provide free of charge and accessible health services to the country's&#13;
most vulnerable citizens. The Government will put a task to the Ministry of Social Affairs&#13;
to identify the really most vulnerable groups of citizens which have the right to receive&#13;
free of charge medical assistance. Besides, it's assumed that the rest of population will&#13;
pay official fees for delivery of those health services, which are not included in the Basic&#13;
Benefits Package.&#13;
10. New Forms of Payment of Health Care Providers&#13;
In the next few years the Government will proceed with the design, testing and&#13;
implementation of new forma of payment of health care providers. In this connection&#13;
some important steps have been already done in terms of shifting from the old, capacity-&#13;
based budgeting system to the activity based one, also to the financing the out-patient&#13;
polyclinic services on the basis of the number of population served by each GP. The&#13;
Government will try to form a payment system which will:&#13;
1) emphasize the Primary Health Care as the basis of the health care&#13;
2) pay the health care providers according to the efforts they put and efficiency of those&#13;
3) allow patient to choose a provider so long as the provider has an appropriate license&#13;
for professional activities&#13;
4) remunerate health care providers of both public and private sector equally for similar&#13;
services&#13;
11. Improvement of Financing Information Systems&#13;
In order to implement the health finance reforms described above, it is necessary to&#13;
improve and modernize the health financial information system. In particular, the&#13;
Government intends to design, test, and implement an integral medical and financial&#13;
information system which will assist health care authorities in making strategic decisions,&#13;
will allow improvement of forms of payment of health care providers, and will allow the&#13;
Government to control the expenditures of public money in health care.&#13;
12. Health Care Non-Public Financing Strategy&#13;
Armenian Government is actively designing a reform in order to improve the efficiency&#13;
and fair distribution of public funds of health care. Alongside with this it remains true&#13;
that most of financing of Armenian Health Care is done in a private way, directly from&#13;
patients as unofficial payments to health care providers. In the long term the Government&#13;
expects this situation to be improved in the frame of the general economic situation&#13;
improvement, when the state is able to extend the scope and types of medical assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

guaranteed by itself. In the short term, the Government is intending to undertake the&#13;
following steps to improve the situation:&#13;
1) introduction of a BBP guaranteed for everyone&#13;
2) introduction of a system of official charges for non-vulnerable groups for services not&#13;
included in the BBP&#13;
3) promotion of a competition among health care providers by offering free choice of&#13;
provider to citizens.&#13;
The Government is also committed to exploring options for increasing the efficiency of&#13;
private spending by piloting insurance schemes on the community level, as well as&#13;
creating a legal basis for formation of private medical insurance companies which can&#13;
offer voluntary insurance for the layers able to pay.&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
IN HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Social Assessment (SA) of the Health and Education Sectors was conducted to&#13;
provide information to the Government of Armenia about people's attitudes and behaviors&#13;
regarding utilization, access and satisfaction with education and health services. This SA is only&#13;
one step in the information consultation process. The SA consisted of both quantitative (a&#13;
questionnaire) and qualitative research (interviews and focus group discussions). The main&#13;
findings are summarized below.&#13;
Health Sector Assessment&#13;
Chapter 1: Utilization of Services&#13;
2.    Attendance at the Facilities: The quantitative study puts attendance of polyclinics over&#13;
the last twelve months at 37 percent of visits at the polyclinics and 19.3 percent at the hospital.&#13;
Attendance did not vary along rural-urban lines. This level of use of polyclinics provides an&#13;
opportunity for reforms focused on the support of primary care facilities.&#13;
3.     Choosing a Facility:&#13;
a.     Polyclinics: Patients commonly visit the district polyclinic where they are&#13;
registered but may chose to go to a different one -- knowing that specialists may require&#13;
a fee. According to the survey, patients chose to go to the polyclinics for the following&#13;
reasons: primary care visits initiated by the patient (51.6 percent); immunizations (26.5&#13;
percent) follow-up or other visits initiated by the physician (15.3 percent); and&#13;
humanitarian assistance (3.6 percent). However, according to physicians, patients were&#13;
spurred to come to the polyclinic for humanitarian assistance (drugs), and other&#13;
administrative reasons.&#13;
b.     Hospitals: The main finding regarding hospital attendance is that patients chose&#13;
to go to the hospital not only for in-patient care or tests but also for outpatient care from&#13;
a specialist (39 percent of visits). Inpatient care represents 46.5 percent of visits and&#13;
consultation or diagnostic tests represent another 14 percent. Urban patients outside of&#13;
Yerevan were least likely to go to the hospital for hospitalization (34 percent of visits)&#13;
and most likely to go for outpatients care (50 percent of visits). This difference in level&#13;
of attendance between Yerevan and other cities may be explained by the fact that many&#13;
polyclinics outside of Yerevan are housed in the same building as the hospital, share the&#13;
same specialists, thereby blurring a strict distinction between the two types of facilities.&#13;
4.     Choice of Practitioner: At the polyclinic level, 33 percent of visits were to a specialist&#13;
yet over half went to the district physician. The type of practitioner visited differed significantly&#13;
by location. According to the survey,&#13;
*  Villagers are least likely to visit the district physician (46.7 percent).&#13;
from "Social Assessment Report on the Education and Health Sector in Armenia." E. Gomart,&#13;
December 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
*  Yerevan residents are slightly less likely (54 percent) than other urban residents&#13;
(56.5 percent) to visit a district physician.&#13;
*  Villagers are least likely to visit an outpatient specialist and Yerevan residents are&#13;
most likely.&#13;
*  Only village residents reported visiting a nurse (30 percent of visits by villagers).&#13;
With regard to hospital attendance, according to the survey:&#13;
*  Patients mainly went to the hospital on their own initiative (56 percent), rather than&#13;
by referral (30 percent).&#13;
*  Referral rates do not vary significantly between rural and urban areas or between&#13;
Yerevan and other cities.&#13;
*  However, in Yerevan, patients are least likely to go to the hospital on their own&#13;
initiative (48 percent) compared to other types of sites (approximately 60 percent of&#13;
visits).&#13;
5.     Treatment Seeking Behavior:&#13;
a.     Diagnosis: The majority of respondents (59.4 percent) who said they were ill in&#13;
the last 30 days were not diagnosed at a formal health facility. Instead patients chose not&#13;
to get a diagnosis (19.8 percent); self-diagnosis (27.5 percent); to be diagnosed by a&#13;
friend or acquaintance doctor (10.4 percent) or by a folk healer (1.4 percent). Self-&#13;
diagnosis and no diagnosis were chosen by over half of those who were ill living in&#13;
Yerevan (50.4 percent); and 49.2 percent in the villages, and only 37.5 percent of other&#13;
urban residents. The highest rate of non diagnosis was in the villages. These may be&#13;
seasonal figures. Focus groups conducted at the same time as the survey, at harvest time&#13;
in August, said that they are postponing diagnosis until after the harvest because of lack&#13;
of cash and time. Villagers were also the only ones to report that a nurse had provided a&#13;
diagnosis (12 percent). In focus groups, people explained that they seek out diagnosis&#13;
from different practitioners because they said that they do not trust diagnoses which are&#13;
seen to be motivated by profit. Another reason is that patients believe that diagnostic&#13;
equipment and skills are poor.&#13;
b.     Treatment: Overall, more than half of the people who were ill in the last 30&#13;
days did not seek treatment. The treatment seeking behavior varied by category of&#13;
location: Yerevan (40.7 percent); villages (43.5 percent) and other cities (52.9 percent).&#13;
According to survey respondents, the main reason for not seeking treatment is the cost of&#13;
care, including transportation costs for 30 percent of village residents. Another reason&#13;
was that patients prefer to self-treat -- which may hide other problems of access or&#13;
perception of quality of care.&#13;
6.     Focus group discussions pointed out that because of the cost of care, people need to&#13;
prioritize health needs at the household level. People prioritize according to two main criteria:&#13;
*  Emergency care prevails over maintenance, including preventative care such as pre-&#13;
natal care; and&#13;
*  Children's needs prevail over those of parents and other adults.&#13;

Chapter 2: Access to Health Services&#13;
7.     There are three main issues with regard to access to health care: physical access, costs of&#13;
access, and cost and availability of essential inputs.&#13;
a.     Physical Access: According to the survey, the majority of respondents live&#13;
within a 30 minute walk from the nearest facility. Even in villages, distance and time to&#13;
the facility are short. However, 10 percent of the sample said that they have no access to&#13;
a polyclinic because none exists in the vicinity. It is evident that physical access is more&#13;
difficult for village residents. Indeed, as noted previously, 30 percent said that they had&#13;
not sought treatment when they were last ill because of transportation difficulties,&#13;
including costs. A response which was never given by urban residents. In addition,&#13;
during focus groups, rural participants explained that their health problems commonly&#13;
require more sophisticated assistance than what is available at the local facility because:&#13;
appropriate specialist services do not exist; the facility is closed or the facility is devoid&#13;
of the necessary equipment and medicines.&#13;
b.     Costs of Health Care: According to the survey, the cost of treatment is the main&#13;
determinant of access. 39.7 percent of survey respondents said that they did not seek&#13;
treatment because of high costs of care. The mean cost of a polyclinic visit is US $8&#13;
while the mean cost of a hospital care is US $70. The following comments refer to&#13;
Table 2, which provides quantitative findings on pricing of health services:&#13;
*  There is a two tiered-pricing system, one at the polyclinic level and the other at the&#13;
hospital level. Prices are lower at the polyclinic level and payments are less&#13;
frequent. At the hospital level, prices are high and payment is customary for most&#13;
services.&#13;
*  Nurses and FAP doctors are rarely paid.&#13;
From the qualitative work the following comments can be made (Refer to Table 1):&#13;
*  A conformity in prices quoted by participants for services at a same facility suggests&#13;
that there is in fact, little opportunity to negotiate price and a level of formality in&#13;
pricing.&#13;
*  While some prices vary considerably around the country for various services (e.g.&#13;
diagnostic exams, births and abortions), others are remarkably the same (e.g. dental&#13;
care).&#13;
*  Prices vary however greatly by type of facility. Prices are higher in the city hospital&#13;
than in the district center's hospital, which in turn are higher than those in the village&#13;
hospital.&#13;
*  Frequency of payment varies greatly by site for polyclinics and FAPs and depends&#13;
on the type of service.&#13;
*  Everyone gets paid in the hospital. As one interviewee said: "You have to pay&#13;
everyone [in the maternity ward]: from the sanitation worker, to the nurses, the&#13;
doctors, for medicines, the mechanic, registration, the guard, etc." Sometimes, even&#13;
the head doctor takes a "tax" from the doctors' fees.&#13;
*  To many, it is not clear whether the fees they pay are formal/ legal or whether they&#13;
are informal. This limits the patients' ability to claim his/her right to free care.&#13;
*  Payments for health services are not new for Armenia. In the past, they were&#13;
generally paid as thanks to the doctor upon successful completion of the treatment.&#13;
The price was also set by the patient and therefore based on the patient's willingness&#13;
to pay. Today, patients are increasingly required to pay before treatment and for&#13;
consultations at a fee set by providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX4&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
* Direct payment to the doctor seems to remain taboo for two reasons. First, prices are&#13;
communicated to patients by "everyone wearing a white coat except for the doctor."&#13;
And when doctors did tell patients their fees "to their faces," many patients were&#13;
appalled at doctors' callousness. Second, an intermediary -- a relative or&#13;
acquaintance -- is often asked to physically pay thle doctor.&#13;
c.     Essential Inputs: Medicines: According to the survey, medicines is one of the&#13;
main concerns of patients -- with patients outside of Yerevan reporting the highest rates&#13;
of dissatisfaction. According to the focus groups, dissatisfaction is linked to costs and&#13;
availability. Indeed, focus group discussants said that free medicines from the health&#13;
facilities are rare. When they are provided they are often the cheapest drugs, and the&#13;
amount provided is insufficient to cover full treatment. Even with a prescription for free&#13;
medicines, they are difficult to obtain from pharmacies. In addition, pharmaceuticals --&#13;
from basic supplies to specialized medicines -- are often unavailable in cities outside of&#13;
Yerevan. Finding medicines even in Yerevan is time-consuming and unsystematic.&#13;
Another issue raised by participants is that of the lack of quality control of&#13;
pharmaceuticals and the lack of professionalism of plharmacists.&#13;
8.     Financing: Survey respondents said that they finance these high medical costs through&#13;
current income, savings, and above all the sale of sold property, jewelry, and other assets&#13;
(43.5%). In focus groups, patients said that they generally borrow money to cover immediate&#13;
costs of care until they can sell personal assets and repay the loan. Without the assets, people are&#13;
reluctant to borrow money, and are likely to avoid or discontinue treatment.&#13;
9.     Coping Strategies: According to the focus groups, because of the high costs of care,&#13;
households have sought to reduce their health expenditures. The most common strategy is to&#13;
decrease their use of health care services or to drop out before treatment is completed, according&#13;
to doctors and patients alike. Other coping strategies includc:&#13;
*  seeing a friend, neighbor or acquaintance doctor outside of the formal health care&#13;
system;&#13;
*  paying in-kind (agricultural products or crafts);&#13;
*  negotiating a lower price for the services; and&#13;
*  turning to folk imnedicine (medicinal plants), or folk healers.&#13;
However these offer a fairly limited opportunity to reduce costs while meeting health needs.&#13;
Chapter 3: Satisfaction with Services&#13;
10.    Quality of care: Patients' assessment of the quality of care depends greatly on their&#13;
expectations from the health services. Over 75 percent of survey respondents were generally&#13;
satisfied or highly satisfied with practitioners' expertise, attitude toward patients, and duration of&#13;
waiting time. On the other hand, they were most dissatisfied with availability of medicines and&#13;
the physical conditions in the facilities.&#13;
11.    According to the focus groups, criteria for evaluating services include:&#13;
*  a free cure (including consultation, medicines and supplies) is available;&#13;
*  the doctor does not require payment up front and accepts to be paid once treatment is&#13;
completed successfully;&#13;
*  the doctor is attentive and kind;&#13;
*  the doctors are present during opening hours;&#13;
*  the premises are clean and hygienic, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANEX 4&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
* the treatment is effective.&#13;
12.    Contrary to the survey findings, the focus groups discussed many instances which&#13;
suggest:&#13;
* Tense patient-client relations. Conflicts arose around issues of payment or&#13;
availability of supplies and medicines;&#13;
* Lack of trust in diagnosis and treatment because doctors are seen to be motivated&#13;
by profit, rather than an interest in the patient's well-being. This is linked to a&#13;
perceived lack of accountability of doctors;&#13;
* Quality of care is satisfactory only if the patient pays, otherwise patients say that&#13;
doctors ignore them, even in emergency situations;&#13;
* Lack of trust in doctors' expertise is exacerbated by the numerous cases of&#13;
misdiagnosis and failed treatment provided during the discussions.&#13;
Chapter 4: Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
13.   Main problems: Based on the survey and focus groups results, the main problems&#13;
identified by respondents were: cost of treatment; cost and availability of medicines; lack of&#13;
accountability of doctors; and lower access to health care for the rural population. The latter is&#13;
evidence by: highest rates of non-diagnosis, highest rates for seeing a nurse instead of a qualified&#13;
health care provider; lower access to medicines; and higher overall access cost because of&#13;
transportation difficulties.&#13;
14.   Recommendations: During the focus groups, a number of recommendations were made:&#13;
* Formal fees are not expected to reduce the costs paid by the patient. An increase in&#13;
the salaries of doctors is not seen as the answer to decrease the informal fees charged&#13;
by doctors.&#13;
* The government should provide health insurance options and information.&#13;
* A parallel system should be created to guarantees a degree of equity of access to the&#13;
poor.&#13;
* An emphasis on primary health care can reduce the cost of care at the national and&#13;
household levels.&#13;
* More information on reforms should be provided to communities and health care&#13;
providers.&#13;
15.    Feedback on proposed Reforms: The main comments on the proposed reforms&#13;
were:&#13;
* An emphasis on primary health care could reduce health costs at the household and&#13;
national levels.&#13;
* Family doctors, if well trained, may be well received by patients. However, health&#13;
providers, especially specialists, are generally not open to the concept of re-training&#13;
as primary care providers.&#13;
Community managed health facilities may generate a higher level of accountability to the&#13;
population they serve.&#13;

PROJECT MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
1.      Two sets of indicators have been defined: process indicators (or input and output&#13;
indicators) to measure progress in project implementation and impact indicators (or outcome&#13;
and impact indicators) to evaluate the impact of the project towards project objectives. In&#13;
addition, some key health sector indicators will be monitored to get assurances that adequate&#13;
public resources are allocated to the health sector and essential public health programs are&#13;
implemented. Most project inputs will be monitored as part of the Project's Implementation.&#13;
Key policy benchmarks included in the Letter of Development of Armenia Government will&#13;
also be monitored and reviewed annually by the World Bank and the Government.&#13;

            Armenia - Health Financing and Primary Care
            Health Care Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The project will support implementing
            Armenia's health financing and primary health care
            reform. Its objectives are to: 1) improve primary health
            care quality and efficiency; 2) improve efficiency,
            transparency, and targeting of public health spending; and
            3) mobilize communities to take an active role in defining
            local health care priorities and sustaining basic health
            care services. The project consists of 3 components:
            strengthening the primary health care system, strengthening
            the health financing system, and project management. The
            primary health care system will be strengthened by: 1)
            training and retraining primary health care staff, providing
            technical assistance for curriculum development and a
            business plan to include indicators and benchmarks
            monitoring service improvements and incentives for staff; 2)
            introducing practice guidelines for preventive health care,
            including screening and diagnostic procedures, medical case
            management, practice management, and reporting to national
            and local health authorities; and 3) improving the
            infrastructure and equipment in selected PHC facilities.
            Health financing reform will: 1) support the design and
            establishment of a State Health Agency and Health Management
            Information System, the latter consisting of the design of
            new medical and financial reporting forms, and automation of
            data collection and analysis, payments and accounting; 2)
            improve basic benefits package methodology; and 3) develop
            provider payment methodology, including standardizing
            contracts, monitoring performance, and implementing a plan
            to legalize and regulate private payments to health care workers.
