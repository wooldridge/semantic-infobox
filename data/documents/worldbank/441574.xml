sustainability of the&#13;

auction or negotiate,&#13;
and how to avoid the    periodic reauctioning offers an effective solution to the natural monopoly problem. Price&#13;

regulation may no longer be necessary, and rebidding may help with contract adjustment.&#13;
Edwin Chadwick proposed this solution to the natural monopoly problem in 1859, and Harold&#13;
Demsetz resurrected the notion in 1968. Rebidding for concession-type arrangements is&#13;
therefore sometimes called a Chadwick-Demsetz auction. This Note examines the case for&#13;
rebidding.&#13;
Rebidding is a practical option when assets   Valuing the incumbent's assets&#13;

Problems arise wvhen the concessionaire's assets  at the bid price for the service, regardless of&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The longer a concession lasts, the less
            effect the initial rounds of bidding will have on the terms
            of the concession over its full life. Much more influential
            will be periodic renegotiations or price reviews, which
            under standard concessions are hard to settle by
            competition. It has been suggested that competition could be
            brought to bear by periodically reauctioning a concession,
            which would limit the potential for exercise of market power
            by concessionaires. If contracts can be well written and
            rebidding is practical, periodic reauctioning offers an
            effective solution to the natural monoply problem. Price
            regulation may no longer be necessary, and rebidding may
            help with contract adjustment. This Note examines the case
            for rebidding.
