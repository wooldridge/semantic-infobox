rebound never came; in fact, GDP fell by 0.2 per-        10&#13;

In addition to the direct impact on per capita in-&#13;
come (an eightfold acceleration if total income&#13;
growth is not affected), there would be an indirect&#13;
impact: reduced population growth allows re-&#13;
sources to be invested in improving productivity&#13;
and welfare, instead of being stretched out to cover&#13;
more people. Conversely, failure to match lower&#13;
mortality with lower fertility would reduce the&#13;
projected gains in per capita incomes. These issues&#13;
will be explored in depth in World Development&#13;

Conclusions&#13;
Steady growth in the industrial world is vital for&#13;
developing countries. At the same time, domestic&#13;
policies are critical for their performance. And these&#13;
are within their control. The scenarios discussed&#13;
in this chapter convey one clear policy message:&#13;
while there is some scope for improving resource&#13;
mobilization, the principal area for improvement&#13;
is in the efficiency of resource use. One major&#13;
source of greater efficiency is tradeby better ex-&#13;
ploiting comparative advantage. To improve eco-&#13;
nomic performance requires both policy reforms&#13;
and strengthened institutions for management&#13;

  Increase in real GDP valued at current prices divided by investment at current prices. This is the reciprocal of the incremental-capital-output&#13;
ratio, adjusted for differential rates of inflation in investment goods and GDP. It is thus equivalent to income rate of return on revalued&#13;
capital.&#13;
     GDP growth rates were negative.&#13;

 The colors on the map show what&#13;
 group a country has been placed in on&#13;
 the basis of its GNP per capita and,&#13;
 in some instances, its distinguishing&#13;
 economic characteristics. For example,&#13;
 all low-income countries, those with a&#13;
 GNP per capita of less than $410, are&#13;
 colored yellow. The groups are the&#13;
 same as those used in the 27 tables&#13;
 that follow, and they include only the&#13;

 than 1 million.&#13;

World Development Report 1983 analyzes in its opening chapters the severe repercussions&#13;
of the 1980-82 world recession on developing countriesthe stagnation in world trade,&#13;
compounded by the sharp deterioration in commodity prices and high interest rates&#13;
that have halted economic progress in so many countries and given rise to severe debt&#13;
problems. In reviewing prospects for the 1980s, the Report argues for concerted in-&#13;
ternational action to roll back protectionism and maintain growth in capital flows,&#13;
especially concessional aid to low-income countries.&#13;
  The unfavorable external environment tacing the developing countries lends partic-&#13;
ular urgency to strengthening development performance. The management aspects of&#13;
development are the main topic of he 1983 edition. The second part of the Report&#13;
discusses the means available to governments to make their bureaucracies and state-&#13;
owned enterprises more efficient. It focuses on issues in economic planning, financial&#13;
management, decentralization, and accountability. The authors have drawn heavily&#13;
on country experience worldwide, as well as on the Bank's own experience gained&#13;
from assisting several thousand projects over the past quarter century.&#13;
  Numerous tables and multicolor maps and graphics supplement the main body of&#13;
the Report. Case studies are interspersed to provide analyses directly related to the&#13;
substance of the text. The final portion of the Report comprises "World Development&#13;
Indicators," 2? two-page tables containing economic and social profiles of 125 countries.&#13;
  World Development Report has been published annually by the World Bank since     1978.&#13;
Each edition examines the current world economic situation and prospects as they&#13;
relate to development and offers a detailed analysis of a particular topic or sector of&#13;
importance in economic and social development.&#13;

            This report is the sixth in an annual
            series assessing development issues. It reviews recent
            trends in the international economy and their implications
            for the developing countries with a special focus on the
            management and institutional aspects of development. The
            early recovery in the world economy foreseen in last
            year's World Development Report did not materialize.
            The recession has lasted longer than expected and has set
            back global development more decisively than at any time
            since the Great Depression. The indications of an upturn are
            now firmer, but the international financial system remains
            severely strained and protectionism continues to be an
            ominous threat. This report reviews how alternative policies
            may affect the future prospects for recovery. It concludes
            that the present financial crisis is manageable, provided
            concerted efforts are made both nationally and
            internationally. It is essential for the industrial
            countries to maintain the momentum of their recovery, to
            promote freer trade, and to ensure growth in capital flows.
            Equally important, developing countries must for their part
            continue their efforts to adjust their economies to the new
            external circumstances and thereby regain the confidence of
            their creditors.
