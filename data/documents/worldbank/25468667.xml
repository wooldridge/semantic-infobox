&amp;#12;ii   S o m a l i a Econ o m ic Update â&#128;¢ 2015&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Iam very pleased to introduce the first in a series of Somalia Economic Updates. With this series, the&#13;
 World Bank aims to shine a spotlight on Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s economy, assess economic trends, and provide regular&#13;
analysis that we hope generates debate among Somalis both inside and outside the country.&#13;
&#13;
The first edition is titled Transition amid Risks. Like others, the Bank is encouraged by the progress that&#13;
Somalis have made in the last three years to rebuild their country. Against immense challenges, reforms&#13;
to economic and public finance management are setting new standards of accountable governance&#13;
and sustainable development for Somalia. These changes are essential if the country is to generate the&#13;
investment, services, and jobs that its youthful population need. So far, there are positive signs that the&#13;
economy is responding: Somalis are returning from abroad, shops are opening, new financial institutions&#13;
have been licensed,and property markets are booming.&#13;
&#13;
However, the challenges are still daunting. Macro-fiscal management, revenue mobilization, and the&#13;
enactment of key legislation are all still in need of continued attention and support. Businesses, as vibrant&#13;
and as central as they have been in Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s story, may soon reach the limits of their growth if the state&#13;
fails to provide the public goods that any private sector needs: physical security, security of contracts, and&#13;
regulation that ensures fair competition, a level playing field, and the basis for investment.&#13;
&#13;
The first in this series of economic updates features a Special Focus on Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations.&#13;
It is timely that Somalis engage in a structured and technically informed debate about the nature of&#13;
economic and fiscal relations within Somalia. At its heart, intergovernmental fiscal relations is about&#13;
economic solidarity. Like any country, Somalia will have natural inequities across regions and among&#13;
people. The response to these inequities will lay the foundations for longer-term development.&#13;
&#13;
We hope you find this first edition valuable and look forward to our continued engagement in Somalia.&#13;
&#13;

W      axaan aad ugu farax sanahay inaan idiin soo bandhigo taxanihii koowaad ee Warbixinta Dhaqaalaha&#13;
       Soomaaliya, Bangiga Adduunka isagoo ka duulaya qoraaladan taxana ah ujeedadiisuna tahay inu&#13;
ifiyo dhaqaalaha Soomaaliya, si uu u baaro aragtiyaha dhaqaale ee jira, soona gudbiyo falanqayn joogta&#13;
ah taas oo aan rajaynayno inay ka soo baxaan doodo dhex mara dhamaan dadka Soomaaliyeed ee dal iyo&#13;
dibadba joogta.&#13;
&#13;
Qoraalka kowaad waxaa cinwaan looga dhigay MAAREYNTA KHATARTA XAALADA KALA GUURKA. Sida&#13;
qolyaha kaleba qabaan, wuxuu Bangiga Adduunku bogaadiyay horumarka ay Soomaalidu ka samaysay&#13;
xaga dib u dhiska dalkeeda saddexdi sano ee la soo dhaafay. Ka sakow caqabadaha baaxada leh ee&#13;
jira, isbedelada dhaqaale iyo maaraynta nidaamka maaliyadeedba waxay jaangoynayaan heerarka isla&#13;
xisaabtanka, maamul-wanaaga iyo joogtaynta horumarka Soomaaliya. Isbedeladdani waa kuwo muhiimad&#13;
u leh marka dalku abuurayo maalgashi, adeegyo, iyo shaqooyinka ay u baahan yihiin dadweynaha&#13;
dhalinyarada u badan. Inta la ogyahay, waxaa jira calaamado muujinaya in dhaqaaluhu soo hagaagayo:&#13;
Soomaalidii dibadaha ayey ka soo noqonayaan, waxaa la furanaya Dukaamo, hayâ&#128;&#153;ado maaliyadeed oo&#13;
cusub baa ayaa ruqsadihii samaystay, iyo suuqa hantida ma guurtada ah oo sare u sii kacay.&#13;
&#13;
Si kastaba ha ahaate, caqabaduhu weli waa kuwa jira. Maaraynta dhaqaalaha guud, dakhli uruurinta,&#13;
iyo fulinta shuruucda muhiimka u ah oo ay xeer-dejintu ansixiyeen waa kuwa weli u baahan taagerid&#13;
iyo feejignaan joogta ah. Ganacsigu, waa mid kobcaya wuxuuna tiir dhexaad u noqday waxyaabaha ay&#13;
Soomaalidu aad u hadal hayso, haddii ay dawladdu ku guul-daraysato inay fuliso baahida guud ee laga&#13;
mamaarmanka u ah ganacsiga gaarka loo leeyahay, waxaa durbadiiba xadidmaya kobacii inuu qof waliba&#13;
u helo fursad uu ku guulaysan karo, taaso ah saldhiga maalgaashiga.&#13;
&#13;
Muuqaalada taxanaha ee warbixinta dhaqaalaha Soomaaliya waxay si gaara diirada u saaraysaa&#13;
nidaamka maaliyadeed ee federaalka. Waa waqtigii ay Soomaalidu si habaysan oo farsamo ku dhisan&#13;
u qaban lahayd doodo la xiriira nooca dhaqaale iyo xiriirada maaliyadeed ee Soomaaliya ka dhaxayn&#13;
kara. Gunaanadkii, tani waa dhaqaalaha oo la wadaago. Sida dal walba, Soomaaliya waxaa ka jira isu&#13;
dheelitir laâ&#128;&#153;aan u dhaxaysa xaga khayraadka dadka iyo Goboladaba. Ka jawaabida isu dheelitir-laâ&#128;&#153;aantani&#13;
waxay aasaaska u dhigaysa horumarka mustaqbalka fog. Waxaan idin rajaynayaa inaad qoraalkan ka&#13;
heli doontaan waxyaabo muhiim ah, Isla mar ahaantaana annaga oo joogtayn doona xiriirka Bangiga&#13;
Adduunka iyo Soomaaliya ka dhexeeya.&#13;

                                                                           October 2 0 1 5 | Edition No. 1   v&#13;
&amp;#12;                             MAIN MESSAGES AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
Somalis face a daunting development challenge to overcome the legacy of two decades of sustained conflict and&#13;
fragilityâ&#128;&#148;but substantial progress is now being made. The new government inherited a dysfunctional economy&#13;
facing high levels of poverty and inequality, a youth bulge, high unemployment, and large infrastructure gaps. The&#13;
Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) has embarked on a process of structural, legislative, and institutional reform.&#13;
The economy is starting to respond: Somalis are returning from abroad to invest, shops are opening, and the property&#13;
market is booming. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank estimate Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP at about $5.7&#13;
billion in current dollar terms in 2014.&#13;
&#13;
Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s vibrant private sector may reach the limits of its potential if further reforms to the enabling environment,&#13;
particularly to security and access to finance, are not pursued. Throughout the years of conflict and fragility, Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
private sector helped maintain economic activity. However, in the absence of appropriate sector regulation, the&#13;
emergence of monopolistic or anticompetitive behavior may be discouraging new businesses from entering the market&#13;
and small and medium-size business from growing.&#13;
&#13;
The de facto intergovernmental fiscal arrangements that are emerging as interim state administrations are formed&#13;
will affect what is politically possible to negotiate as part of the constitution-making process. In particular, state&#13;
administrations are occupying most available tax bases, limiting the scope for the federal government to play its proper&#13;
role in redistribution. It will be challenging for states to give away these revenue bases unless they also hand over cost&#13;
responsibilities. For its part, the federal government is not in a fiscal position to accept the handover of functions to the&#13;
federal level, unless it also gains control over more revenue bases to pay for them.&#13;
&#13;
Inequitable distribution of resources was a fundamental cause of conflict in Somalia; it must be addressed in the&#13;
design of the new arrangements. The distribution of the main revenue basesâ&#128;&#148;in particular, customs revenueâ&#128;&#148;is&#13;
likely to be creating inequality across states. Addressing inequality requires that poorer states receive transfers, either&#13;
from the central government (provided it has sufficient revenues to do so) or from other states that are better off. The&#13;
design of intergovernmental fiscal arrangements for Somalia must address this challenge. In the absence of a solution,&#13;
it seems likely that states will erect domestic customs barriers, which will undermine growth of Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s small and&#13;
fragile economy.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Enhancing growth and macroeconomic stability&#13;
The rehabilitation of public institutions that can generate public goods and services will be an enabler of long-term&#13;
economic development, but it will rely on increasing the stateâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal capacity. Meeting Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;ssocioeconomic&#13;
challenges is difficult, given the legacy of weak institutions and regulatory frameworks, weak governance, and limited&#13;
public services delivery. The reform of public institutions takes 20 years even in the fastest-reforming countries. The FGS&#13;
and subnational governments are prioritizing the establishment of credible public finance institutions for macro-fiscal&#13;
management. Revenue mobilization of additional business turnover taxes is a critical priority if the state is to increase&#13;
its fiscal capacity and extend services to the population. In parallel, the authorities are trying to attract new talent into&#13;
reformed civil service institutions at the federal and subfederal levels, in line with fiscal space.&#13;
&#13;
Improving human and economic development outcomes is central if Somalia is to sustain its transition from conflict&#13;
to stability. With estimated per capita GDP of $435 in 2013, Somalia is the fifth poorest country in the world, reflecting&#13;
two decades of conflict.During this time, physical infrastructure was destroyed or not maintained, and two generations&#13;
of Somalis went without education. Only 42 percent of school-age children are estimated to be enrolled in primary&#13;
school, of which just 36 percent are girls. Youth are disproportionately affected by poverty and unemployment and&#13;
areprey to recruitment into militia or radicalized groups.About 67 percent of 14- to 29-year-olds are believed to be&#13;
unemployed. More spending to the social sectors is key to addressing these major developmental challenges.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Developing intergovernmental fiscal arrangements&#13;
Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s new fiscal arrangements should be designed to (a) work as a coherent system, preserving a strong common&#13;
economic space across the country, and (b) provide scope to address inequities across regions.These objectives&#13;
reinforce each other. If states without access to strong revenue bases are supported through transfers, they will be less&#13;
likely to look for economically harmful ways to raise revenue. As political bargains are struck, efforts should be made to&#13;
achieve balance between functional responsibilities and the availability of revenue to fund them.&#13;
&#13;
Somali stakeholders should be prepared to develop a sustainable fiscal bargain incrementally, renegotiating as fiscal&#13;
circumstances and the interests of states and federal government change over time. It may not be possible to reacha&#13;
permanent fiscal bargain immediately. The focus now should be on developing robust intergovernmental institutions to&#13;
facilitate ongoing negotiation and negotiating a way forward rather than finding a final fiscal arrangement.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.	 A dynamic, organic approach should be                   4.	 Resources should be distributed in an&#13;
    grounded in cooperative intergovernmental                   equitable and inclusive manner. Resource&#13;
    institutions. In all countries, intergovernmental           competition and unequal access to limited&#13;
    fiscal arrangements often evolve over time. Such            resources prolonged the conflict in Somalia.&#13;
    evolution is particularly likely in fragile contexts,       Unequal access to resources is also likely to&#13;
    where the fiscal landscape and balance of                   trigger the movement of people across regions,&#13;
    interests among stakeholders is likely to change.           as insecurity has already prompted migration to&#13;
    Given the dynamic conditions, an incremental                urban areas. Addressing inequality will require&#13;
    approach, under which fiscal design evolves                 a significant redistribution of revenues among&#13;
    through successive agreements over time, may                FMSs. This redistribution could be achieved&#13;
    be more realistic. The immediate focus should               through sharing arrangements agreed upon&#13;
    therefore be on nurturing intergovernmental                 by the states or through transfers from federal&#13;
    mechanisms through which these agreements                   to state governments. If the transfers are the&#13;
    can be negotiated on an ongoing basis.                      preferred option, the FGS will need additional&#13;
2.	 Intergovernmental financing arrangements                    revenuesâ&#128;&#148;either by quickly mobilizing&#13;
    work best as a coherent whole. Decisions on                 additional revenue bases or by transferring&#13;
    the design of one component will affect what is             revenue bases from states to the center.&#13;
    feasible for other components. Fundamentally,       5.	 The assignment of functions should aim at&#13;
    resources and cost responsibilities should be           efficiency. The more functions lower levels&#13;
    matched. A degree of political expediency or            of government are responsible for, the more&#13;
    compromise is inevitable and indeed important,          responsive services will be to the needs of&#13;
    but some regard for how those decisions affect          citizens. But Somalia is a poor country with&#13;
    the overall balance in the system should be             limited capacity. At least in the short term,&#13;
    maintained.                                                         it does not make sense to have&#13;
3.	 Fiscal arrangements should                                          multiple organs of government&#13;
    support a strong and unified                                        developing the capacity to do the&#13;

     The Somalia High Frequency Survey is highly innovative. It leverages private sector know-how and open-source applications to collect high-quality data under&#13;
     difficult field conditions. In fragile states and areas beset by conflict and insecurity, safety and risk considerations limit the time available for face-to-face&#13;
     interviews. These concerns make it difficult to supervise the quality of data collection in the field and prevent administering detailed household consumption&#13;
     recall modules and using traditional poverty and inequality measurement methods. The Somalia High Frequency Survey embodies a number of innovations to&#13;
     overcome these constraints. It provides the authorities with a new approach to collect the data required to estimate a reliable poverty profile of the population&#13;
     in such a context.&#13;

     The CBS is focusing on registration. Under the regulations, licensing demands a higher standard to be met by the applicant and more information disclosures&#13;
     to test the fitness and propriety of owners, partners, directors, and officers. Others measures include mandatory requirements to have an in-house Antiâ&#128;&#147;&#13;
     Money Laundering (AML) program with training and an AML officer. AML also requires validation and verification of the information and statements made by&#13;
     applicants. Under these regulations, the CBS is also required to review risk and risk-management elements and to modulate the level of sophistication needed&#13;
     on an institution-by-institution basis commensurate with the level of risk. The review process under the registration regulation is limited to CBS officials&#13;
     checking the content of information in order to confirm the completeness of applications.&#13;

&#13;
     Box 3.1: How is â&#128;&#156;deriskingâ&#128;&#157;affecting Somalia?&#13;
 The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines derisking as â&#128;&#156;the phenomenon of financial institutions terminating&#13;
 or restricting business relationships with clients or categories of clients to avoid, rather than manage, risk.â&#128;&#157; Banks&#13;
 in Australia,the United Kingdom,and the United States, among others,have closed the accounts of money transfer&#13;
 operators because of perceived legal and regulatory problems, sanctions, and antiâ&#128;&#147;money laundering/combating the&#13;
 financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) risks.&#13;
&#13;
 Account closures have caused changes in how the market works in the United Kingdom and the United States, but&#13;
 anecdotal evidence collected by the World Bank and data from Remittance Prices Worldwide indicate that costs to&#13;
 consumers have not changed significantly. Costs could rise if competition in the remittance market in Somalia falls&#13;
 substantially.&#13;
&#13;
 The British government, in conjunction with the World Bank, is developing the Safer Corridor Initiative. This effort aims&#13;
 to tackle key deficiencies in the UK-Somalia remittance corridor until a sounder financial system is in place in Somalia&#13;
 and to accelerate and support the development of that financial system. Any measures to improve transparency and&#13;
 compliance will involve taking actions at the first mile (the United Kingdom), second mile (the United Arab Emirates),&#13;
 and third mile (Somalia). Third-mile measures will be the most difficult to implement, because Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s financial sector&#13;
 has not developed in a formal way and the country remains extremely isolated from the global financial infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
 In 2014 the FGS took measures to formalize Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s financial sector. The CBS licensed and registered six banks and nine&#13;
 MTBs and registered nine MTBs under the registration and licensing regulations passed by the CBSin 2014, developed&#13;
 with the support of the World Bank. Somalia does not yet have a system in place for knowing your client (KYC) or&#13;
 customer due diligence (CDD) requirements. Some money transmitters are considering using biometric identification&#13;
 to meet KYC requirements.&#13;
&#13;
 The FATF recommends the application of a risk-based approach to address AML/CFT risks. This approach allows&#13;
 countries and financial institutions to apply simplified AML/CFT measures when risks are assessed to be low. However,&#13;
 major financial institutions are currently operating in a risk-averse environment. Given the complexities of this corridor,&#13;
 they seem unwilling to try to mitigate the risks associated with servicing these money transfer operators.&#13;

     analyzes what it means for Somalia given the fiscal architecture that is emerging. It comprises five section.&#13;
     Section 6 provides a brief overview of key principles drawn from the analysis that follows. Section 7 overviews&#13;
     progress in forming the federal state of Somalia. It reviews the history of unitary democracy, centralized&#13;
     dictatorship, and state collapse and examines the emergence of a nascent federal system. Section 8 presents&#13;
     a framework for thinking about the design of intergovernmental financing arrangements. It reviews the&#13;
     de facto intergovernmental financing arrangements that are being established as FMSs are forming and&#13;
     examines how they are likely to affect the development of durable intergovernmental fiscal arrangements&#13;
     as the constitution-making process unfolds. The section concludes with observations that it may be more&#13;
     realistic to expect fiscal arrangements to evolve over time, as fiscal conditions change and as trust develops&#13;
     between the stakeholders Section 9 considers the institutional requirements of a well-functioning federal&#13;
     system, particularly in relation to the negotiation and operation of intergovernmental relations. It suggests&#13;
     next steps for collecting information and conducting analysis that will inform a well-considered process of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         Box 6.1: What Is a federal system?&#13;
     According to the Forum of Federations (a global network of federalism and devolved governance) federalism is:&#13;
       essentially a system of voluntary self-rule and shared rule. This is implied in the derivation of the word federal, which&#13;
       comes from the Latin foedus, meaning covenant. A covenant signifies a binding partnership among co-equals in&#13;
       which the parties to the covenant retain their individual identity and integrity while creating a new entity that has its&#13;
       own integrity or entity as well. A covenant also signifies a morally binding commitment in which the partners behave&#13;
       toward each other in accord with the spirit of the law rather than merely the letter of the law. A covenant is more&#13;
       than a contract; it commits the parties to an enduring, even perpetual, relationship and to an obligation to achieve&#13;
       the ends of the agreement and to resolve peacefully the conflicts that invariably arise in every relationship.&#13;
     Federalism is thus â&#128;&#156;both a structure and a process of governance that establishes unity on the basis of consent while&#13;
     preserving diversity by constitutionally uniting separate political communities into a limited, but encompassing, polity.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

        The fragility of the current system of government is evidenced by the fact that the Puntland Government has announced the severing of its relationship with&#13;
        the FGS twice since 2012, resulting in a parallel political process to resolve disputes. Similarly, only months after the interim Southwest administration was&#13;
        formed, it set up customs posts between the Benadir region and the new state. The action resulted in a dispute between the Benadir region, the interim&#13;
        Southwest, and the FGS. Early in 2015, the Federal Parliament voted to disapprove the composition of the newly constituted Interim Jubba Administration&#13;
        (IJA). In response, the IJA announced that it would sever its ties with the FGS. The Interim Administration of South West State (ISWA) also took issue with the&#13;
        composition of the IJA regional assembly. Frictions have also arisen between Puntland and the FGS over the formation of the Galmudug Interim Administration.&#13;
        Such examples highlight the need for mechanisms to resolve government to government disputes.&#13;

        Article 54 of the Provincial Constitution grants the Federal Government powers over foreign affairs, national defence, immigration and citizenship, and&#13;

     In theory, competition between states can be healthy driver of efficiency in more mature federal systems â&#128;&#147; since states will seek to strike the most attractive&#13;
     balance between levels of taxation and the services that can be provided. However, Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s public sector is still extremely under-developed and it will be&#13;
     some time before tax competition is likely to be healthy rather than harmful to the economy.&#13;

     A confederation is an association of independent sovereign units that join together for certain purposes. The federal level of government is often nominated&#13;
     by the members of the confederation, rather than directly elected. United Arab Emirates and Bosnia and Herzegovina are examples of confederal systems.&#13;
     Consociational power sharing involves non-territorial power sharing among all the important communities within a state, regardless of where they live. State&#13;
     institutions are designed to accommodate proportional representation of these communities, and veto power for minorities. Executive institutions like the&#13;
     cabinet are designed to ensure representation of all groups. Within this framework, the individual communities are self-government. Belgium and Lebanon&#13;
     are two examples of consociational government. The fourth model proposed by the report was a unitary decentralized democracy.&#13;

      Article 142 of the Constitution on Existing Federal Member States in Somalia includes a provision that â&#128;&#156;(1) Until such time that all the Federal Member States&#13;
      of Somalia are established and the adopted Federal Member State Constitutions are harmonized with the Somali Federal Constitution, the Federal Member&#13;
      States existing prior to the provisional adoption of this Provisional Constitution by a National Constituent Assembly shall retain and exercise powers endowed&#13;
      by their own State Constitution.â&#128;&#157; In theory, the provisions of the Constitution on preexisting states also apply to Somaliland, but in practice this is not relevant&#13;
      since Somaliland does not consider itself part of the federal state system.&#13;

      Somaliland also claims Sool, Sanaag, and Ayn (part of Togdheer).&#13;

      Following the agreement, the process of forming a viable state has been ongoing; the final step of constituting a parliament was completed in May 2015,&#13;
      although a reconciliation process to bring along unhappy clans still needs to continue.&#13;

      Somaliland is not part of the state-formation process, as it does not consider itself part of Somalia. However, separate tentative discussions of the status of&#13;

tax and transfer system that finances them.24                                       intergovernmental fiscal relations in post conflict&#13;
These components rest on a foundation of                                            states summarizes insights from international&#13;

In an ideal world, these components would be                                        and natural resources. Any of these areas can&#13;

the design of the tax and transfer system are two                                   to be robust enough to prevent new conflicts&#13;
halves of a system that must function as efficiently                                from emerging. It is also likely that the interests,&#13;

These components need to be designed, or                                            over time. Fiscal arrangements are more likely to&#13;
retrofitted, to operate as a single system.                                         evolve in line with these changes if designed with&#13;

     Ethiopia divides taxes based on the nature of the taxpayer. Because the private sector is relatively small, much of its tax revenues come from taxing public&#13;
     servants and publicly owned enterprises. Federal public servants and companies pay tax to the federal government, while taxes on state employees and&#13;
     companies go to state governments.&#13;

      Box 8.2: Chile and Germany have fraternal intergovernmental transfer systems&#13;
 In fraternal intergovernmental transfer systems, better-off subnational governments share resources with governments&#13;
 that are less well-off. Fraternal systems are supposed to promote national unity, because citizens whose governments&#13;
 receive transfers can see that citizens from other regions have given something up to help them. They can be difficult&#13;
 to enforce, however, and in the situations described below the inter-regional transfers are enforced through strong&#13;
 discipline from central government.&#13;
&#13;
 Chileâ&#128;&#153;s Municipal Common Fund&#13;
 Municipalities are the third level of decentralized government in Chile. Because of the tax bases assigned to them,&#13;
 they have more fiscal autonomy than provinces. There is a wide disparity between rich and poor municipalities. Three-&#13;
 quarters of municipalities rely on transfers for more than 80 percent of their revenue.&#13;
&#13;
 To reduce disparities, the government created a system in which municipalities contribute 60 percent of their property&#13;
 taxes (65 percent in the four richest municipalities) and 50 percent of their vehicle taxes (most of which come from the&#13;
 wealthier municipalities) to the Fondo ComÃºn Municipal (Municipal Common Fund). The four wealthiest municipalities&#13;
 also contribute a proportion of the commercial taxes they raise. The proceeds of the fund are distributed according to&#13;
 a formula that is based on equal shares, poverty, tax-exempt land in the municipal area, and per capita revenues from&#13;
 other sources.&#13;
&#13;
 Germanyâ&#128;&#153;s Solidarity Pacts&#13;
 Following the reunification of East and West Germany, the six newly incorporated states in eastern Germany had&#13;
 significantly lower revenue-raising capacity than western Germany. Because Germanyâ&#128;&#153;s constitution mandates the&#13;
 sharing of taxes, there was limited capacity to address this inequality through top-down fiscal transfers. Instead, the&#13;
 presidents of the states (lander) and the federal government agreed on a â&#128;&#156;solidarity pact.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
 The first pact was negotiated in 1995; the second came into force in 2005. Both pacts provide for states with the&#13;
 greatest fiscal capacity to share some of their revenue from tax sharing with the poorer states. The states contribute&#13;
 to the equalization pool on a graduated scale, with states most above the national average contributing the most. The&#13;
 federal government also contributes to the fiscal equalization pool and provides support to the economies of poorer&#13;
 states in a variety of ways.&#13;

      Since natural resources are often located in remove regions, derivation-based sharing of natural resource revenues may have immediate appeal as a way of&#13;
      compensating for the economic disadvantage otherwise experienced by that region. International experience, for example in Indonesia (Papua and West&#13;
      Papua) and Papua New Guinea (Southern Highlands) is that these regions end up with far more discretionary resources than the rest of the country, but much&#13;
      less capacity to spend it effectively.&#13;

     Residents of other states, who pay higher prices for the goods they consume, bear part of the burden of these taxes.&#13;

     In some countries, two levels of government share larger tax bases, such as income tax or VAT, but this mechanism involves complex negotiations to ensure&#13;
     that the overall level of tax is appropriate and does not discourage economic activity.&#13;

In the absence of support from fiscal transfers,                               Internationally, there are many different variations&#13;
emerging states may erect domestic trade                                       in the ways in which ownership, control, and&#13;
barriers as a way of capturing revenue as goods                                revenue entitlement are configuredâ&#128;&#148;but very&#13;
cross their borders. Domestic trade taxes (called                              few examples of joint management by two levels&#13;

taxes have two important drawbacks, however.                                   management is not out of the question, it raises&#13;
One is that they are prone to leakage, because                                 considerations that need careful thought, including&#13;
payments are often collected in cash. An equally                               the risks and inefficiencies associated with&#13;
important concern is that they erect domestic                                  politicized or complicated multilevel negotiation&#13;
barriers to trade. Somalia cannot afford to create                             and approval processes. Issues of revenue sharing&#13;
disincentives to economic activity. However, unless                            could be separated from questions of control&#13;

First, transferring customs duty to the federal               The distribution provisions covered only the first&#13;

of customs duties would have affected different               by the constitutional architects as the result of&#13;
states in different ways. In the end, the Australian          ongoing intergovernmental negotiation (see Box&#13;
Constitution provided for the transfer of customs             8.3). Today Australia is one of the most fiscally&#13;
and excise powers to the federal government,                  centralized federal countries.&#13;
&#13;
     Box 8.3: Australiaâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal architecture has evolved&#13;
The formation of the federal Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 brought together six previously self-governing&#13;
colonies, each with its own fiscal arrangements. The Constitution, negotiated over a decade leading up to federation,&#13;
was fundamentally a bargain struck by the six constituent units. Retaining state autonomy was an important goal of the&#13;
negotiations. Accordingly, the powers of the federal government were limited, and states were given residual powers.&#13;
&#13;
The most important revenue sources for the colonies at federation were customs and excise duties. The six colonies&#13;
had operated as independent economic units, taxing the movement of one anotherâ&#128;&#153;s goods across their borders. As in&#13;
Somalia, each state levied customs duty at different rates, taxing the taxed movement of goods across state borders.&#13;
One aim of federation was to form an economic union. State perspectives on economic union varied considerably,&#13;
however, with some states promoting free trade and others wanting to protect their local industries. Two colonies had&#13;
begun diversifying their revenue base by imposing land and income taxes; other, less developed states were unable to&#13;
do so, because their populations were itinerant. Underdeveloped states were consequently more reliant on customs&#13;
revenue. Because the fiscal circumstances of the states varied greatly, the fiscal provisions of the Constitution proved&#13;
very difficult to negotiate.&#13;
&#13;
The final constitutional settlement gave the federal government exclusive control over the most important tax&#13;
base but subject to revenue sharing with states. Customs and excise duties were transferred to the Commonwealth&#13;
government as exclusively federal taxes, with a uniform tariff to be imposed within two years. The federal government&#13;
was also given four key spending responsibilities: defense, foreign affairs, pensions, and post and telecommunications. It&#13;
proved very difficult to accommodate the very different fiscal circumstances of each state, because tariff harmonization&#13;
affected each of them differently. In the end, it was agreed that Western Australia could continue to levy duties on&#13;
goods from other states on a diminishing basis for a period of five years, as the redistribution effected by the uniform&#13;
tariff took effect.&#13;
&#13;
The question of how to distribute the surplus customs revenue back to the states proved the most difficult to&#13;
negotiate. In the end, the Constitution included a temporary solution, known as the Braddon clause. For a period of&#13;
10 years, the Commonwealth was permitted to use one-quarter of customs revenue for its own expenditure needs.&#13;
Surplus revenues from customs duty would be returned to the states. Until uniform tariffs were imposed, each stateâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
â&#128;&#156;shareâ&#128;&#157; of customs duties was calculated based on how much revenue had been raised in that state; for a period of five&#13;
years following the imposition of uniform duties, duties accrued to the state in which the goods were consumed. For&#13;
the purpose of calculating the surplus, Commonwealth expenditures were charged against states on a per capita basis.&#13;
It was envisaged that return of the surplus on a derivation basis would give way to a system of federal transfers to the&#13;
states, which the Commonwealth Parliament would legislate once the Braddon clause expired.&#13;
&#13;
Australiaâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal architecture changed radically after federation, in ways that the constitutional architects had not&#13;
envisaged. What was essentially a derivation-based system in which states received the surplus generated in that state,&#13;
gradually gave way to a system of intergovernmental transfers based on need. The federal government, which had&#13;
started at federation with only customs and excise revenue, gradually assumed other tax bases. A federal income tax&#13;
was introduced to finance participation in World War I. Later the federal government made access to intergovernmental&#13;
transfers conditional on states not imposing state income taxes, effectively crowding states out of this tax base. Over&#13;
the first 100 years of federation, Australia went from having a highly decentralized tax and transfer system to having one&#13;
of the most fiscally centralized federal systems in the world.&#13;

central government at the start. Fiscal integration&#13;
&#13;
     Box 8.4: Bosnia and Herzegovina gradually achieved fiscal integration through tax reform&#13;
 Following the comprehensive peace agreement initiated at Dayton Ohio in 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina was&#13;
 established as a single sovereign state made up of two entities: the Serb Republic, including about 60 municipalities,&#13;
 and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The new country had two subnational tiers, consisting of 10 cantons&#13;
 and about 80 municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
 The design of the fiscal architecture drew on the fiscal legacy of Yugoslavia, in which most revenues were raised and&#13;
 retained by the republics, which then made bottom-up transfers to fund the federal government. This arrangement&#13;
 created considerable budgetary vulnerability at the federal government level, because its functioning was dependent&#13;
 on transfers from the better-off republics.&#13;
&#13;
 The accord reached in Dayton gave the sovereign state of Bosnia and Herzegovina limited responsibilitiesâ&#128;&#148;for foreign&#13;
 affairs, trade, and immigration; customs policy; monetary policy; and regulation of communications, transport, and law&#13;
 enforcement (but not defense). All powers not allocated to the federal government, including the right to raise an army,&#13;
 were reserved to the entities. The federal government was provided with no independent tax sources. For more than&#13;
 10 years, its activities were financed entirely from transfers from the entities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
 provided two-thirds of the federal budget, and the Serb Republic provided one-third. Indirect taxes accounted for&#13;
 about 70 percent of all revenues in both entities; they were owned by the entity where they were raised, with shares&#13;
 to canton and municipal level in the case of sales tax. Cantons and municipalities were heavily dependent on sales tax&#13;
 revenue, which accounted for 70 percent of cantonal revenue in the federation and 50 percent of municipal revenue in&#13;
 the republic. Distribution on the basis of origin generated substantial interregional inequity.&#13;
&#13;
 With support from international actors, the two entities reached agreement on the harmonization of indirect taxes.&#13;
 A harmonized customs law was adopted in 1998, followed by harmonized excise taxes in 2000 and sales tax in 2001.&#13;
 Integration of tax administration proved more difficult, partly because of a policy in the federation to share all sales tax&#13;
 revenues with the canton level.&#13;
&#13;
 Agreement on the introduction of a VAT was finally reached in the mid-2000s and implemented on 1 January 2006. It&#13;
 was agreed to establish a state-level Indirect Tax Authority and pool all taxes in a single account. The single account&#13;
 provided state government for the first time with a revenue source to supports it functions. It was first applied to fund&#13;
 the state budget and service Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ&#128;&#153;s debt, with the balance shared between the entities. Because&#13;
 of the difficulty in attributing VAT revenue to a particularly location, a new basis for distributing the balance had to&#13;
 be found. The parties agreed to share VAT revenue on the basis of a formula that guaranteed the respective shares&#13;
 of entity, cantons, and municipalities within the federation and of the entity and the municipalities within the Serb&#13;
 Republic. To ensure support for the changes, municipalities were given at least as much revenue as they had received&#13;
 from the sales tax, with the new formula phased in over six years.&#13;
&#13;
 The introduction of VAT not only succeeded in introducing a single national tax administration system and giving the&#13;
 national government a revenue stream to support its functions, it also increased interregional equity. Disparities in per&#13;
 capital income at the cantonal level fell from 4: 1 to 2: 1, and municipal-level differences fell from 200: 1 to 35: 1.&#13;

bargain for the federal state. Box 9.1 describes the            government. Meetings at the political level are&#13;
other three types of institutions that have proved              supported by more frequent and more detailed&#13;
useful in other countries.                                      meetings at the technical level, where the day-&#13;
&#13;
     Box 9.1: Three types of institutions can support dynamic and responsive intergovernmental fiscal relations&#13;
Finance Commissions&#13;
A number of countries have formal (often constitutional) finance commissions that provide advice on revenue-&#13;
sharing arrangements. In some cases they advise on the overall division of resources among levels of government;&#13;
in other cases their mandate is confined to advising on sharing among levels of government. They help take the heat&#13;
from political debates about resource sharing, particularly if they provide a technically expert and credible evidence&#13;
base to inform these decisions. Three key policy choices must be made in designing these commissions: (a) whether&#13;
membership is technical (as in Australia, India, and South Africa) or political (as in Nigeria and Pakistan); (b) whether the&#13;
body sits on a permanent basis (as in Australia, Kenya, and South Africa) or periodically (as in India); and (c) whether the&#13;
commissionâ&#128;&#153;s mandate is limited to horizontal sharing between states (as in Australia and Nigeria) or extends to sharing&#13;
between levels as well (as in Kenya and South Africa).&#13;
&#13;
Upper Houses of Parliament&#13;
Upper houses can function as forums for intergovernmental relations. Their impact depends on how they are&#13;
constituted. In South Africa, the Council of Provinces is made up of the premiers of the provinces, who provide a direct&#13;
voice for state governments in the national Parliament. In Australia and Kenya, senators are elected by the voters of the&#13;
state. Because they are elected separately from the state government, rather than being chosen by them, they do not&#13;
necessarily represent the interests of the state government; sometimes they are actively in competition with it. They&#13;
do however represent the interests of voters in their state. Composition of the upper house will depend on whether it&#13;
is intended to represent state governments or the citizens who reside in states. If these houses have intergovernmental&#13;
relations functions, they usually have limited mandates, related to vetoing legislation affecting states; they may have&#13;
no powers with respect to the budget or exclusively federal concerns. Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s Provisional Constitution provides for an&#13;
upper house with 54 directly elected members representing the FMSs and an equal numbers of senators based on the&#13;
18 regions that existed before 1991 (Article 72).&#13;
&#13;
Dispute Resolution Bodies&#13;
Dispute-resolution institutions include constitutional courts and other mechanisms. The court is almost always the&#13;
final arbiter of constitutional disputes, including disputesrelating to financial provisions, although its jurisdiction is&#13;
sometimes limited. In South Africa, parties are required to exhaust other options before resorting to courts. In Papua&#13;
New Guinea, interpretation of certain constitutional provisions is non-justiciable (meaning they cannot be challenged&#13;
in court) or justiciable only at the instigation of one or other government, not private individuals. Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s Provisional&#13;
Constitution establishes a constitutional court consisting of five judges, nominated by the Judicial Services Commission&#13;
and approved by the lower house of Parliament (Article 109B).&#13;

agriculture, health, and education (see Article 52      negotiating. It would work most effectively if&#13;
in Annex A). The same article envisages that FMSs       backed up by a committee of technical officials.&#13;
may enter into cooperative agreements with other        Part of distilling the issues would involve creating&#13;
federal states or the federal government.               a common platform of information to inform joint&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;                            Transition amid Risks&#13;
         with a Special Focus on Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations&#13;
&#13;
The Somali economy has remained resilient, driven by the private sector despite two decades&#13;
of conï¬&#130;ict. The private sector helped the economy mitigate the devastating consequences of&#13;
war and drought. Somali entrepreneurs adapted well and even ï¬&#130;ourished in a stateless&#13;
conï¬&#130;ict-ridden economy. There has been signiï¬&#129;cant private sector investment growth in&#13;
trade, money transfer services, transport and telecommunications, funded by remittances&#13;
from the diaspora. The IMF and the World Bank estimate Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP at around US$5.7&#13;
billion in current dollar terms in 2014. This puts Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP per capita at US$435 making it&#13;
the 5th poorest country in the world.&#13;
&#13;
The Federal Government of Somalia is faced with a daunting task of creating a peaceful and&#13;
secure environment, building strong institutions of governance, and delivering key public&#13;
services to a weary population after decades of war. These challenges can only be overcome&#13;
if the FGS takes a leading role to sustain economic reconstruction by creating a stable&#13;
macroeconomic environment that would underpin rapid economic growth, job creation, and&#13;
poverty reduction. This can only happen when the Federal government has the resources from&#13;
both the public and donors.&#13;
&#13;
The special focus of this Update examines intergovernmental ï¬&#129;scal relations in Somalia and&#13;
highlights the challenges and lessons drawn from theory and international experience to&#13;
provide an analysis of what this means for Somalia given the de facto architecture of ï¬&#129;scal&#13;
arrangements that is currently emerging. One of the recommendation from this work is that&#13;
Somaliaâ&#128;&#153;s new ï¬&#129;scal arrangements should be designed to work as a coherent system,&#13;
preserving a strong common economic space across the country, and provide scope to&#13;
address inequities between regions. As political bargains are struck, regard should be given to&#13;
the balance between functional responsibilities, and the availability of revenue to fund them.&#13;
Another recommendation is that Somali stakeholders should be prepared to develop a&#13;
sustainable ï¬&#129;scal bargain incrementally, renegotiating as ï¬&#129;scal circumstances and the&#13;
interests of states and federal government change over time. It may not be possible to ï¬&#129;nd a&#13;
permanent ï¬&#129;scal bargain immediately. The focus now should be developing robust&#13;
intergovernmental institutions to facilitate ongoing negotiation, and on negotiating a way&#13;
forward rather than a ï¬&#129;nal ï¬&#129;scal arrangement.&#13;

            risks with a special focus on intergovernmental fiscal relations
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Somalis face a daunting development
            challenge to overcome the legacy of two decades of sustained
            conflict and fragility, but substantial progress is now
            being made. Since 1991 and the collapse of the Siad Barre
            regime, Somalia has experienced cycles of conflict and
            fragility that fragmented the country, undermined legitimate
            institutions, and created widespread vulnerability. The new
            government that emerged following the Transitional Federal
            Government and the Roadmap to End the Transition in 2012
            inherited a dysfunctional economy facing high levels of
            poverty and inequality, a youth bulge, high unemployment,
            and large infrastructure gaps. Against a backdrop of
            political progress marked by the emergence of new Federal
            Member States (FMSs) within the new constitutional framework
            and continued insecurity, the Federal Government of Somalia
            (FGS) has embarked on a process of structural, legislative,
            and institutional reform. The economy is starting to
            respond: Somalis are returning from abroad to invest, shops
            are opening, and the property market is booming. This is the
            first economic update for Somalia since the 2005 World Bank
            country economic memorandum for Somalia. The long conflict
            made monitoring of economic and social data nearly
            impossible since the late 1980s. With the relative stability
            of the past few years, new data have become available. The
            update is divided into two parts. Part one presents
            information on the social, economic, and governance status
            of Somalia. Part two focuses on intergovernmental fiscal relations.
