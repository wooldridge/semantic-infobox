ABSTRACT&#13;
This report is part of an inquiry undertaken by the World Bank&#13;
in conjunction with scholars from 12 industrial countries into the&#13;
penetration of the markets of industrial countries by export of&#13;
manufactures from developing countries. The project sought to establish&#13;
the shares of industrial country markets held by the developing&#13;
countries, changes in such shares in the 1970s, and why they vary among&#13;
industry groups and countries.     The aim is to assist developing and&#13;
industrial countries to improve their policies through a better&#13;
understanding of trade patterns and protectionist pressures.&#13;
This paper examines trade policy in France and the tools,&#13;
particularly public subsidies, used to support industry.     It begins by&#13;
looking at the nature of France's international commerce as it evolved&#13;
in the 1970s and at French trade policy.       Attention is paid to the&#13;
institutional structure through which trade policy is decided on and&#13;
implemented.   It concludes by assessing probable future trends.     As a&#13;
major objective of the work was to gather information on trade policy&#13;
and its implementation, to a large extent the material is descriptive.&#13;
In the 1970s, the bulk of France's international trade was with&#13;
developed countries.    Trade with developing countries was mainly with&#13;
France's   former   possessions.     Other   developing   countries  have&#13;
encountered quite restrictive attitudes on France's part.&#13;
Just 20% of France's trade falls under the Common External&#13;
Tariff.   Among the measures it has used to influence imports have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
quantitative restrictions, exchange rate policy, "safeguard" measures&#13;
and non-tariff barriers.     Subsidies to industry have also been used&#13;
extensively.   The system of subsidies is complex, involving numerous&#13;
measures and institutions that have evolved piecemeal over 20 years.&#13;
The same complexity has also characterized government assistance for&#13;
exports.&#13;
Beginning in 1981, the government decided to reform the system&#13;
of public assistance to industry.     The effort involved three lines of&#13;
endeavor:     the  simplification   and  harmonization   of  the   system,&#13;
decentralization of the allocation of assistance to the regions, and&#13;
greater selectivity in allocations.&#13;
The new government, while more disposed toward intervention,&#13;
will probably support this reform program. Moreover, the importance of&#13;
trade to France's economy will tend to discourage a return to greater&#13;
protectionism.   Another limiting factor is the Community-wide tariffs.&#13;
At the same time, protectionist pressure remains strong and has support&#13;
among the public and some politicians, as well as the "bureaus."&#13;
Combined with protectionist moves in other developed countries, this&#13;
could lead to greater protection.&#13;
Trade will also be influenced by the extension of the&#13;
nationalized sector. The priorities, however, are likely to remain the&#13;
same, e.g., there will be continued support for high technology sectors.&#13;
&#13;

I INTRODUCTION&#13;
Government intervention in France has been important since the&#13;
early stages of commercial and industrial growth.-/ Accordingly, in the&#13;
1970s, public assistance was a significant instrument of French trade&#13;
policy.    This was   particularly  true  since  France  had been   facing&#13;
2/&#13;
substantial   fiscal  pressures-/   and  had  an   important  nationalized&#13;
3/&#13;
sector.-&#13;
It is within this context that public subsidies in France are&#13;
analyzed in this paper*.4/     The changes in industrial structure and&#13;
patterns  of  specialization   during  the  1970s  are  reviewed  briefly,&#13;
followed  by  a  discussion   of the  subsidies   to  industry.   Finally,&#13;
financial   assistance  for  exports   is  addressed,   along  with  trade&#13;
policy.   As  one   purpose  of  this  initial   analysis  was  to  gather&#13;

and their implications.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
II INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE AND THE PATTERN OF SPECIALIZATION&#13;
International    trade   and    the   pattern    of   industrial&#13;
specialization in the French economy changed rapidly during the 1970s.&#13;
Two aspects are worth noting here.      First, most French international&#13;
trade was with developed countries and took place at a deficit.       The&#13;
main  commercial  surplus   came  from  trade  with  non-OPEC  developing&#13;
countries, a fact that underscores the importance to France of good&#13;
relations with the developing countries.     The surplus arose mainly in&#13;
France's trade with its former possessions, most of which were little&#13;
industrialized. As a result, France was quite free to be restrictive in&#13;
its trade policies with the other developing countries, as they could&#13;
not easily retaliate against its trade restrictions (or buy off the&#13;
restrictions by offering contracts).&#13;
The second point is that France's economy rapidly became more&#13;
specialized, and presumably more "efficient," through better use of the&#13;
trading opportunities offered by the rest of the world.       The need to&#13;
safeguard this efficiency has emerged as a constraint that discourages a&#13;
backslide into protectionism.&#13;
Geographical Trade Patterns&#13;
Nearly 70 percent of France's international trade is carried&#13;
out with the OECD countries, with EC countries accounting for almost 50&#13;
percent of it. The deficit, noted earlier, is shown in Table 1. It&#13;
began to grow very quickly at the end of the last decade and was very&#13;
important to the trade in industrial products (intermediate or capital&#13;

goods), particularly with Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands&#13;
and the United States.&#13;
Table 2 shows that France had a surplus in its trade with Italy&#13;
(growing because of exports of automobiles and energy) and with the&#13;
United Kingdom (declining because of oil imports and a decline in&#13;
exports of automobiles).&#13;
As shown in Table 3, the total trade balance with the non-OPEC&#13;
developing countries and with the centrally planned economies was&#13;
positive. Where the trade balance was positive for industrial products,&#13;
it was because of surpluses with the developing countries, mainly those&#13;
in the French franc area and in North Africa.      The trade balance with&#13;
Asian countries was positive until 1979 but became negative in 1980.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
To  an   extent,  bilateral   trade   balances  influence   trade&#13;
policies. The reason is that the deficit country tends to feel that it&#13;
has less to lose from a trade dispute than does the country against&#13;
which it is seeking to discriminate.    Given the geographical pattern of&#13;
French trade, this fact may help account for the resilience of&#13;
protectionist sentiment in France. However, the favorable trade balance&#13;
surplus in industrial products with the non-OPEC developing countries&#13;
may have moderated these tendencies, encouraging France's "pro-South"&#13;
political stance.&#13;
As remarked above, a detailed analysis of French trade patterns&#13;
suggests that the second factor did not strongly limit protection for&#13;
manufactured goods.    Policy-makers were aware, however, that there was&#13;
much to gain from allowing French international trade specialization to&#13;
increase.   The contribution to growth in France that had resulted from&#13;
the international specialization in recent years was recognized.&#13;
France's international specialization was studied recently in&#13;
detail.-1    The research showed important trends in specialization for&#13;
industrial products.2/ The surplus in industrial products had been 5.7&#13;

Table 4 summarizes the trade balance for manufactured products&#13;
from 1970-78:   it became positive for intermediate goods and even more&#13;
positive for equipment goods, but negative for consumer products.&#13;
However, this specialization, which reflects a better adjustment to the&#13;
pattern of international demand, is less important if volume data&#13;
(measured in constant francs) rather than values are taken into account.&#13;

III SUBSIDIES TO INDUSTRIES&#13;
A thorough analysis of subsidies requires detailed statistical&#13;
information on each sector in order to compute the sectoral rates of&#13;
assistance..&amp;  So far, such detailed information has not been available&#13;
for France because of a long      tradition  of secrecy.   However, as&#13;
background to further analysis, it is useful to describe the system of&#13;
public subsidies to industries.    (The subsidies given via government&#13;
procurement, fiscal exemptions2/ and transactions of nationalized&#13;
companies have not yet been covered.)&#13;
This section begins with a description of some institutional&#13;
aspects of the subsidization program, followed by an evaluation of the&#13;
subsidies, and concludes with some brief international comparisons.&#13;
Institutional Aspects&#13;
The present system of assistance to industry is characterized&#13;
by institutional complexity. As is well-known in the French bureaucracy&#13;
1/   On this matter, see Industries Assistance Commission, "Assistance&#13;
to Australian Manufacturing Industries, 1974-75 to 1977-1978,"&#13;
Canberra, 1980; and K. H. Juttemeier and K. Lammers, "Subventionen&#13;
in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland" [Subsidies in the Federal&#13;
Republic of Germany], Institut fUr Weltwirtschaft, Discussion Paper&#13;
63-64, Kiel, November 1979.&#13;
2/   The effects of tax exemptions on international competition could be&#13;
analyzed only by taking into account the full effects of a fiscal&#13;
system on external trade, something that has never been carried out&#13;
fully. Little attention has been given to this topic, except by J.&#13;
Maurice and P. Villa "Fiscalit&amp; et Choix de la Tecnique de&#13;
Production Vus I Travers une Reforme de l'Assiette des Charges&#13;
Sociales [Fiscal Policy and Choice in Production Techniques Viewed&#13;
Through Reform of the Basis for Social Payments], Annales de&#13;
l'INSEE 38-39 (September 1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(and as is probably true in other countries as well), a new&#13;
"institution" is created whenever a problem has to be solved.         This&#13;
institution is very often inter-ministerial because several ministries&#13;
are usually involved. However, all important decisions are made by the&#13;
Ministry  of  Economics  and  Finance   (Ministere  de  l'Economie  et de&#13;
Finances) and, more particularly, by the Treasury (Direction du Tresor).&#13;
The main institutions and means for administering public&#13;
assistance to industry are:&#13;
(1) The Fonds de D6veloppement Economique et Social (FDES)&#13;
(the Fund for Economic and Social Development). Created&#13;
in 1955, the FDES receives budgetary appropriations, and&#13;
its principal function is to provide low-interest&#13;
loans.L/    Its Direction Committee is chaired by the&#13;
Ministry of Economics and Finance.&#13;
(2) The Comite Interministeriel pour l'Amenagement des&#13;
Structures   Industrielles   (CIASI)   (Inter-Ministerial&#13;
Committee   for - Industrial    Structural   Adjustment).&#13;
Created  in   1974  and   chaired  by   the  Ministry  of&#13;
Economics,   the  CIASI   is   responsible   for  finding&#13;
solutions   for  firms   in  trouble.     Very  often  it&#13;
recommends loans from the FDES or other financial&#13;
institutions, and budgetary subsidies from the Fonds&#13;
d'Intervention pour l'Amenagement du Territoire (FIAT)&#13;
(Fund for Assistance in Territorial Management) and from&#13;
1/   Sometimes the loans will never be reimbursed, as in the case of the&#13;
steel industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Ministry of Industry (Minist're de l'Industrie) via&#13;
its "industrial policy assistance loans" or "regional&#13;
development premia. '/&#13;
(3)  The  Fonds   Special  d'Adaptation   Industrielle   (FSAI)&#13;
(Special Fund for Industrial Adjustment). It is chaired&#13;
by the Treasury. Created in 1978, the FSAI helps French&#13;
industry  adapt  to international   competition.    It is&#13;
authorized to:&#13;
* Gather financial means for investment in competitive&#13;
industries creating long-term jobs.&#13;
* Allocate investments to areas where there is a&#13;
shortage of jobs, in particular to the northern and&#13;
eastern parts of France (in the iron and steel and&#13;
textiles industries), and in the western and southern&#13;
areas in the shipbuilding industry.    Its coverage is&#13;
therefore extremely broad, an illustration of how&#13;
difficult it is politically to give assistance&#13;
selectively.&#13;
The goal of the FSAI is to assist investment projects&#13;
which create 50 or more jobs lasting at least three&#13;
It is claimed that the CIASI is very efficient for a bureaucratic&#13;
agency.   For each franc of public funds, 8 francs come from other&#13;
sources (Le Nouvel Economiste, January 29, 1979). Decision-making&#13;
in the CIASI is decentralized to the Comites Departementaux&#13;
d'Examen des Problemes de Financement des Entreprises (CODEFI)&#13;
(Departmental Committees for the Review of Business Financial&#13;
Problems). The CODEFIs allocate loans from the FDES in amounts of&#13;
less than 500,000 francs per firm.    According to official sources,&#13;
the CIASI has helped 504 firms and created 230,000 jobs in four&#13;
years (this does not mean that 230,000 jobs have been saved); loans&#13;
from the FDES represent 4,500 francs per job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
years in developing sectors, irrespective of the capital&#13;
intensity, by means of:&#13;
* Subsidies    of  up   to  25  percent   of  investment,&#13;
and&#13;
* Long-term loans with low interest rates and delayed&#13;
reimbursement.&#13;
Investment projects have been mainly in such sectors&#13;
as   mechanical    engineering,    motor   vehicles    and&#13;
electronics.    It is felt that FSAI assistance has a&#13;
leverage  effect  on  private   financing.    Up  to now,&#13;
however, this type of assistance seems to have been very&#13;
costly in terms of the capital expended per capital job&#13;
created.&#13;
(4)  The  Institut  de Developpement    Industriel  (IDI)  (the&#13;
Institute for Industrial Development).     Its goal is to&#13;
increase the capital equity of middle-sized firms. The&#13;
IDI buys shares, lends funds and plays the role of&#13;
"partner" with some leading firms in their specialized&#13;
markets 1/&#13;
(5)  Various   institutions   such  as   the  Cr6dit   National&#13;
(National Institute for Credit to Industry), the Caisse&#13;
Nationale des March&amp;s de l'Etat (National Agency for&#13;
Because  of  its   small  size,  the  IDI's  activities   are  rather&#13;
limited.   From its creation under President Pompidou in 1970 to&#13;
January 1, 1978, it had invested 723.5 million francs in 106&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Public  Procurement),   the  Societes  de   Developpement&#13;
Regional (Societies for Regional Development), etc.&#13;
(6) Various means such as&#13;
&#149; Subsidies for regional development of up to 12,000&#13;
francs or 19,000 francs per job.&#13;
* Subsidies from the Ministry of Industry.&#13;
&#149; Budgetary grants and interest rebates.&#13;
Sectoral Distribution of the Public Subsidies&#13;
As the above general description of the French system of public&#13;
assistance to industry suggests, there is a lack of coherence.        The&#13;
system amounts to complex set of measures and institutions which have&#13;
been implemented over 20 years,. which have many goals in mind and which&#13;
have never been subjected to a general review.        There are obvious&#13;
conflicts between the Ministry of Economics and Finance, the Ministry of&#13;
Industry and the Ministry of International Trade.&#13;
Public subsidies to industry have been only a part of a&#13;
broader, general system of government economic intervention, as can be&#13;
seen from Table 6, where they represent only 20 percent of the total&#13;
amounts.   Direct subsidies to private industrial firms have, however,&#13;
accounted for a major part of the public assistance to industry:       60&#13;
percent of the budgetary appropriations in 1979, or 1.1 percent of GDP&#13;
(Table 7).&#13;
Assistance to private industries has fluctuated between 2.2&#13;
percent and 2.6 percent of industrial value added and between 20.4&#13;
percent and 21.4 percent of industrial gross investment. As is shown in&#13;

Table 8, it rose from 7.73 billion francs in 1974 to 12.13 billion in&#13;
1977, for a rate of growth of 15 percent a year.&#13;
According to an unpublished report from the Ministry of Finance&#13;
which was partly rewritten for the Finance Committee of the National&#13;
Assembly.11 from 1972-1976 this assistance was distributed as indicated&#13;
in  Table 8.   As  these   relative  shares  have  been  computed without&#13;
including the costs of interest rebates on export credits, some look&#13;
quite high, especially that of the aircraft industry 2/      It should be&#13;
noted that Table 8 takes into account the mining industry and energy&#13;

Assistance for exports accounted for more than 25 percent and&#13;
grew faster than other types of assistance during 1974-1978.          This&#13;
reflects Giscard d'Estaing's policy of stabilizing the franc despite&#13;
significant inflation.   It may be observed that as in other industrial&#13;
countries, the lion's share of specific assistance (31.8 percent of the&#13;
total and 50.5 percent of the specific assistance) has been going to&#13;
declining sectors, with a large share going to coal mining.&#13;
A feature of France's public assistance to private firms is its&#13;
high concentration ratio.   According to an unpublished report on public&#13;
assistance to industry, six industrial groups -- which employed 10&#13;
percent of the industrial workers, exported 11 percent of the total&#13;
exports, invested 2 percent of the total industrial investment and&#13;
created 10 percent of the industrial value added -- received 50 percent&#13;
of the total public assistance.-/     Of the total public assistance to&#13;
industry, 56 percent went to 9 industrial groups, 5 of which were&#13;
private groups.-/&#13;
The concentration of public assistance for exports may be&#13;
easily explained:    56 percent of total French exports came from 100&#13;
first exporters, while industrial groups (subsidiaries at least 10&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
percent of whose capital shares were held by such groups) exported 84&#13;
1/&#13;
percent of total French exports.-&#13;
With   respect   to  assistance   to  high   technology,  French&#13;
administrators have followed accepted dogma in focusing on:&#13;
* Computers and microelectronics&#13;
* Space and aircraft industries&#13;
* Sea industries, and&#13;
* Biotechnology.&#13;
On the eve of the last elections, in a somewhat unusual move, textiles&#13;
were added to these high priority sectors. Clearly, political necessity&#13;
makes its own laws.&#13;
The tables also show that an effort was made to stimulate&#13;
growth in the sectors of the future (sectors with high technology, high&#13;
productivity and fast growth in the international markets). This policy&#13;
has probably been desirable, although here waste is also possible (for&#13;
example, there was the largely unsuccessful "Plan calcul" for the&#13;

has been left to the labor market 1/&#13;
The Reform of Public Assistance for Industry&#13;
Reform of the system of public assistance to industry was&#13;
initiated at the beginning of 1981.    The basis for the reform was three&#13;
rather self-evident but hard to implement principles:2/&#13;
m The system needed to be simplified and contradictory&#13;
goals harmonized.   (Was this going to be easy, given&#13;
the conflicting functions of the various Ministries&#13;
and the rivalry between the Ministry of Industry and&#13;
the Treasury?)&#13;
* The allocation of assistance should be decentralized&#13;
to  the   regions.    (This  was   contrary  to  French&#13;
bureaucratic centralization.)&#13;
Assistance should be selective.    (It was pointed out&#13;
how difficult it is to achieve this goal given the&#13;
political interest groups, for whom every act of&#13;
assistance is a precedent justifying another one.)&#13;
1/ Important social policies have been promulgated in some cases,&#13;
particularly in the "Steel Plan," which includes subsidies for&#13;
people who volunteer to leave their jobs or allows retirement before&#13;
65 years of age with 70 percent of former wages. No estimates have&#13;
been found of the trade-displacement costs for French workers, as&#13;
has been done, for instance, in Canada or the United States.&#13;
2/ Defined during the meeting of the Central Planning Council [Conseil&#13;
Central de Planification], held at the Presidency on September 4,&#13;
1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Given that the new French government is more disposed to&#13;
intervention than that which it replaced, it is not about to dismantle&#13;
the system as a whole.      It does, however, believe that support for&#13;
particular sectors can be provided at a reasonable cost, and it&#13;
undoubtedly shares the above three objectives. Even the significance of&#13;
nationalization should not be overrated.     The groups which have been&#13;
taken over were so dependent on assistance and so tied by "contrats de&#13;
programme" that they were already subject to a good deal of government&#13;
control.&#13;
It is clear that, at present, French industrial policy is in a&#13;
state of flux, with some advisers and members of the government&#13;
advocating policies which are not drastically different from those&#13;
pursued  in  the  past,  while   others    favor  a  new  interventionist&#13;
approach.    So far,  President Mitterand has favored a cautious and&#13;
moderate approach, and the two devaluations of the franc may have helped&#13;
to reduce the need for subsidies, following the steep rise in subsidies&#13;
that occurred after the change of government.        It is not, however,&#13;
possible to predict which way French economic policy will go if there is&#13;
a serious economic crunch.&#13;
Some International Comparisons&#13;
Not only are data on assistance scarce, but differences in&#13;
economic structure also need to be taken into account, especially in&#13;
terms of the effects the fiscal system has on international trade.      In&#13;
France, some would argue that the value-added tax, the corporate income&#13;
tax regime for subsidiaries and the territory principle (French firms do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
not pay taxes on profits earned abroad, except when there is a bilateral&#13;
treaty) have had a favorable effect on exports.     French industrialists&#13;
counter that claim by noting that firms pay 75 percent of all French&#13;
taxes, including social security contributions.&#13;
Appraising these arguments would require judgements about the&#13;
incidence of these taxes which are beyond the scope of this paper. Here&#13;
attention is focused only on the subsidies, although it should be&#13;
remembered that they are only part of the picture.&#13;
The French administration has been very sensitive to the view&#13;
often expressed abroad that France is exceptionally generous in granting&#13;
subsidies. However, an unpublished French report notes, with reference&#13;
to an EC report, that in 1977 direct financial assistance (excluding tax&#13;
exemptions) represented 7 percent of all investment in West Germany&#13;
(where tax exemptions are important), 11 percent in France, 13 percent&#13;
in Italy, 12 percent in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands and 20&#13;
percent in Belgium .1/    Nevertheless,   there is truth in the French&#13;
assertions, as pointed out below.&#13;
Public assistance to industries in Britain and West Germany has&#13;
been studied extensively, particularly in Corden and Fels and Peacock.2/&#13;
Their work provides some rough figures.&#13;
1/ It is sometimes said that French assistance for exports (3.7 billion&#13;
francs in 1979, or 0.88 billion U.S. dollars) is less than the tax&#13;
exemption for DISCs (Domestic International Sales Corporation) alone&#13;
(1.2 billion U.S. dollars according to one French official, and 0.70&#13;
billion dollars according to the U.S. Treasury, as reported in Le&#13;
Monde, April 24, 1980).&#13;

According to Peacock,A/ in 1978 the subsidies to the industrial&#13;
sectors in West Germany represented 10,632 billion DM, 2,588 billion DM&#13;
of which were direct payments (grants and loans), while 8,044 billion DM&#13;
came from tax allowances.      The sectoral distribution of the direct&#13;
payments is shown in Table 11.&#13;

The relative size of the subsidies to the mining industries&#13;
should  also  be  noted.     If  tax  allowances  (75  percent  of  total&#13;
assistance) are added, particularly for regional structural development&#13;
(6,175 billion DM out of 8,044 billion DM), it can be seen that regional&#13;
intervention has been a crucial feature in German industrial policy.&#13;
This situation is very different from that in France, where in 1977&#13;
assistance for regional development accounted for just 3.7 percent of&#13;
total assistance (Table 9) and tax allowances were almost negligible&#13;
(mostly for    regional   development   and   amounting   to 0.5 billion&#13;
francs   in  1977).     This   is  because   of  the   well-known  French&#13;
centralization, which the present government is planning to reduce.&#13;
With respect to the United Kingdom, the relative importance of regional&#13;
support and of assistance to the labor market can be observed in Table&#13;
12, whereas Table 13 provides a breakdown of industrial assistance,&#13;
which may be compared, to some extent, with that in Table 11 for the&#13;
Federal Republic of Germany.&#13;
For the three countries -- France, the United Kingdom and West&#13;
Germany -- public subsidies to industry amounted to, respectively,&#13;
26,388 million francs in 1979, 2,321 million pounds in 1977-78 and&#13;
10,632 million DM in 1978.     In U.S dollars, the subsidies were $6.20&#13;
million for France, $5.80 million for West Germany and $4.46 million&#13;
for the United Kingdom.      While the methodologies used to obtain these&#13;
figures were quite different, and although it was not possible to&#13;
examine the figures for the United Kingdom and Germany from an inside&#13;

IV FRENCH INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY&#13;
This section addresses some elements of French trade policy, a&#13;
topic which has been little studied.     Particular attention is paid to&#13;
financial assistance for exports and measures taken at the national&#13;
level, i.e., decided in Paris and not in Brussels.&#13;
Financial Assistance for Exports&#13;
The General Framework&#13;
The general framework for financial assistance for exports is&#13;
very complex.    There are more than 16 types of procedures for aiding&#13;
exports, and most are either obsolete or without significance from a&#13;
financial point of view.    This assistance will be examined under three&#13;
headings:1/&#13;
Financial assistance for investment&#13;
Special loan procedures for exports and&#13;
*    Export insurance.&#13;
Financial Assistance for Investment.    Financial assistance for&#13;
export-linked investment in France and abroad includes:&#13;

"Les Petites et Moyennes Entreprises et l'Exportation" [Small and&#13;
Medium-Size   Businesses   and  Their  Exports],   Journal   Officiel&#13;
(December  15,  1980);  P.  Remond,  "Les Procedures   d'Aide et de&#13;
Financement du Commerce Exterieur" [Procedures for Assistance to&#13;
and Financing of Foreign Trade], a paper presented at the Colloque&#13;

(1) Special loans to finance investments meant to&#13;
promote exports on the condition that the export&#13;
share of shipments outside the EC increase by at&#13;
least 2.5 points in 4 years (available since March&#13;
1974);&#13;
(2) Increased shares of capital held by the CIDISE&#13;
(Comite     Interministerial    de     Developpement&#13;
Investment   et   de   Soutien   d'Emploi)   (Inter-&#13;
ministerial Development Committee for Investment&#13;
and Support of Employment);&#13;
(3) Subsidies for investments made to adapt products to&#13;
meet the requirements of some foreign markets&#13;
(e.g., special weather conditions and special&#13;
standards).   This subsidy is to be reimbursed in&#13;
cases of successful adaptation.&#13;
Financial aid for French investment abroad includes:&#13;
(1) Loans to finance commercial subsidiaries abroad.&#13;
The interest rate is less than the market rate (2.5&#13;
percent for small firms, 1.8 percent for large&#13;
firms).     Since   1976,  these  loans   have  been&#13;
guaranteed by a special state fund.&#13;
(2) Loans to finance industrial subsidiaries abroad.&#13;
These long-term loans are subject to the same&#13;
interest rate prevailing in France but are not.&#13;
subject to the Bank of France credit ceiling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
(3) Some tax allowances for investments outside the EC.&#13;
Special Loan Procedures for Exports.    The Banque Franvaise du&#13;
Commerce Exterieur (BFCE) (French Bank for Foreign Trade), created in&#13;
1946, is both a state bank for financing external trade and a private&#13;
bank specializing in international trade. It competes with other banks,&#13;
whether nationalized or not. The BFCE borrows in monetary and financial&#13;
markets and lends to firms.      It also gives technical assistance and&#13;
specialized information to exporters.&#13;
Loans for exports are mainly extended through the BFCE,&#13;
although other banks and financial institutions such as the Credit&#13;
National also grant such loans.&#13;
There are several types of loans:&#13;
(1)  Pre-financing   loans,   which   generally  may   be&#13;
refinanced with the Central Bank. These loans have&#13;
two advantages:   most are not covered by the Bank&#13;
of France credit ceiling and the interest rate is&#13;
lower than the market rate.     Pre-financing loans&#13;
are related to long-term exports contracts l/&#13;
(2)  Refinancing   of  loans   to  enable   exporters  to&#13;
mobilize short-term credits (less than 18 months)&#13;
granted to a foreign customer.    These loans bear a&#13;
market interest rate, but are not included under&#13;
the credit ceilings.&#13;
1/   If a loan runs more than 18 months, the refinancing is carried out&#13;
by the Central Bank; if the duration exceeds 7 years, the&#13;
refinancing is accomplished by the BFCE.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
(3)  Mid-term and long-term loans.     These have become&#13;
more and more important. They are allocated by the&#13;
Banque de France through the BFCE and Compagnie&#13;
Fransaise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur&#13;
(COFACE) (French Insurance Company for Foreign&#13;
Trade) (see below).    There are two kinds of these&#13;
loans:&#13;
*   Supplier    loans,    allocated     to    French&#13;
exporters.       Although   subject    to   some&#13;
restrictive conditions, these credits may be&#13;
discounted with the BFCE.&#13;
*   Customer    loans,   allocated    for    foreign&#13;
customers; the export firm is paid in cash.&#13;
The interest rates on these loans are lower than market&#13;
interest rates and are financed through budget appropriations.      Rates&#13;
are defined according to the OECD consensus on export credits, which&#13;
sets minimum rates and maximum durations for three kinds of countries:&#13;
rich, middle-income and poor.&#13;
Export Insurance.    Export insurance is organized through the&#13;
COFACE, which was created in 1946. Like the BFCE, the COFACE is both a&#13;
public company responsible for long-term insurance against political&#13;
risks abroad, under the strict supervision of the government, and a&#13;
private business firm that takes the usual risks of an insurance&#13;
company.-&#13;
1/   The shareholders are the French government, with a five-sixths&#13;
interest, and a private insurance company, with one-sixth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
The COFACE has four types of insurance coverage:&#13;
(1) Risks in exploring foreign markets, including&#13;
international fairs, with coverage for up to 70&#13;
percent of expenses.&#13;
(2)  Risks on loans linked to international trade (see&#13;
above). The risks may be political, as in Iran, or&#13;
from   natural    disasters    or   the    financial&#13;
difficulties of customers.&#13;
(3)  Since   1960,   "economic  risks"   encountered   by&#13;
exporters with long-term export contracts.      They&#13;
are safeguarded against the sharp increases in&#13;
production    costs    resulting    from    internal&#13;
inflation.   Since 1977, however, firms have had to&#13;
cover 70 percent of the cost of wage increases&#13;
exceeding the rise in the cost of living.&#13;
(4)  Foreign  exchange   rate  risks.     This  insurance&#13;
guarantees   an  exporter   against  exchange   rate&#13;
fluctuations beyond given limits.&#13;
The Functioning of the System. The French system of assistance&#13;
for exports is, as noted, quite complex. However, two types of aid are&#13;
particularly important:    (1) interest rebates and insurance of export&#13;
credits, and (2) guarantees against "economic risk." These are shown in&#13;
Table 14, in terms of their cost to the budget.&#13;
French economic policy calls for extensive use of interest&#13;
rebates.    In 1979, 43.8 percent of all loans were allocated with&#13;
interest  rates below  the market rate.    Rebates have  been  especially&#13;

In analyzing France's assistance to exports, it is important to&#13;
look at it as a part of a general system of assistance to industry.&#13;
Further, the analysis should be related to recent changes in French&#13;
specialization.    Many  issues need   further  research.    It has been&#13;
claimed, for example, that subsidies are more efficient than tariffs&#13;
are2! In addition, research in progress suggests that the geographical&#13;
pattern of French exports is unusually unstable, especially for equip-&#13;
ment goods.   This may be related to the emphasis in French commercial&#13;
policy on close involvement by high officials and ministers in the&#13;
negotiation of big contracts, an approach that amounts to using the&#13;
system  of   assistance  to  provide   France  with  an   edge  over  its&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
competitors. Such a policy may lead to less stable trade than one which&#13;
is grounded in a country's natural comparative advantages.&#13;
Some Aspects of French Trade Policy&#13;
Although France's trade policy has been protectionist for much&#13;
of its economic history, trade liberalization has been a fundamental&#13;
choice  since  the  foundation  of  the Common Market.i!      Traditional&#13;
attitudes die hard, however, and protectionist sentiment remains fairly&#13;
widespread  among   the  public  and  policy-makers.    Judging  by   such&#13;
indicators as the number of quantitative restrictions that have not been&#13;
put under the EC and that are still administered by member states and&#13;
not the EC, as well as the use of such devices as Article 115 of the&#13;
Rome Treaty to protect its domestic market, France has, by EC standards,&#13;
a restrictive trade stance.      Although tariffs and many quantitative&#13;
restrictions, notably for textiles, are determined at the EC level, the&#13;
French government still retains the ability to set trade policy to some&#13;
extent.&#13;
France and the Common External Tariff&#13;
As a result of the successive rounds of the GATT negotiations,&#13;
culminating in the Tokyo Round of 1973-79r 2/ EC external tariffs have&#13;
fallen to  low levels, as in other industrial countries (Table 17).    In&#13;

addition,  the    tariffs    apply  to only some    of  the EC's  trading&#13;
partners.   Associated countries and those of the European Free Trade&#13;
Area (EFTA) are exempted, as are imports under the Generalized System of&#13;
Preferences (GSP).    Thus only 20 percent of French external trade is&#13;
directly affected by the Common External Tariff.&#13;
Transfer of control over tariffs to a supra-national agency was&#13;
the foundation on which the EC was built. However, there is reason to&#13;
wonder whether the tariff instrument transferred to Brussels is still&#13;
one   of the major instruments of economic policy; an illustration of&#13;
this was that the EC tariffs could not be explained in this study by&#13;
regressions involving French social and political variables. It may be&#13;
that the pattern of the Common External Tariff does reflect some&#13;
European average of political and social forces, but it does not seem to&#13;
be related to those which pertain to France.     From the perspective of&#13;
the French political process, the Common Tariff looks both small and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
irrelevant to the country's problems.  (See Table 18 for figures on the&#13;
level of French tariff protection by industrial classification.)&#13;
The Exchange Rate&#13;
Exchange rate policy has been a very important tool of trade&#13;
policy. France has used it somewhat more freely than other countries to&#13;
gain a competitive edge.   However, since the 1973 oil price increase,&#13;
the government has given more emphasis to maintaining the stability of&#13;
the franc. The outcome can be seen in Table 19, which shows, for main&#13;
currencies, the changes in effective exchange rates relative to a basket&#13;
of currencies, weighted by the world export structure.&#13;
As can be seen, depreciation of the French franc was much lower&#13;
during 1970-1978 than it was during 1964-1978.       While France used&#13;
depreciation of the exchange rate during the 1970s more than West&#13;
Germany or Japan did, it did so, less than the United States, Italy or&#13;
Britain.&#13;
These changes in exchange rates have impacts on trade which&#13;
exceed by far those of the Tokyo Round agreements.      Of course, the&#13;
exchange rate adjustments were made in support of many goals.   It does&#13;
appear, however, that to some extent they were used to promote domestic&#13;
activity by cutting down imports and pushing up exports.&#13;
Other Measures at the National Level&#13;
It was not possible to complete an exhaustive inventory of&#13;
French trade policy measures during the 1970s. However, some important&#13;
decisions were identified, and these are discussed below. A distinction&#13;
is made between the use of safeguard measures and some non-tariff&#13;
barriers.&#13;

Safeguard Measures. Safeguard measures may be taken under the&#13;
safeguard clauses in the GATT (Article XIX) or in the EC Treaty.&#13;
Article XIX, the main safeguard clause of the GATT, has been invoked 80&#13;
times by industrialized countries between 1947 and 1977, particularly by&#13;
the EC on behalf of Italy in 1973 (for tape recorders), for the United&#13;
Kingdom in 1977 (for television sets), and for West Germany and&#13;
France.±'   It is, however, rather complicated to involve Article XIX,&#13;
and  the  Multi-Fibre  Arrangement   (1973 and 1977)  contains  safeguard&#13;
1/   During 1977 it was invoked one time by Canada, two times by the&#13;
United States and five times by Australia.      See Senat [Senate],&#13;
Rapport du Comite du Senat pour le Commerce Exterieur [Report of&#13;
the French Senate Committee on International Trade], vols. I and&#13;

clauses and voluntary exchange restraints that are exceptions to Article&#13;
XIX.&#13;
The safeguard clauses of the Rome Treaty are mainly defined by&#13;
Articles 107, 108, 109 and 115 (and 223 for military security). France&#13;
has   invoked Article 115 a great deal:    19 times in 1973, 10 times in&#13;
1974, 24 times in 1975, 24 times in 1976, 35 times in 1977, 74 times in&#13;
1978, 124 times in 1979, and 81 times in 1980.-k&#13;
French officials say it is usually very difficult to obtain&#13;
safeguard measures   at the EC level.      In part,   this is because of&#13;
resistance by less protectionist partner countries such as West Germany,&#13;
Denmark and Holland. When countries ask for protective measures, the EC&#13;
does not react rapidly and efficiently.     Thus the EC appears to be an&#13;
institution   which  curbs   the  protectionist   pressures   coming  from&#13;
individual countries.&#13;
Some Recent Non-Tariff Measures.    Recently, France has used a&#13;
number of non-tariff measures for specific products.    It should be noted&#13;
that some of the measures have not been oriented toward developing&#13;
countries but toward an EC country.      This occurred with some imports&#13;
from Italy -- shoes (in 1976) and clothing or knitted goods (in 1977 and&#13;
1979).&#13;

The compulsory certificate of origin can be interpreted as a&#13;
general protectionist measure (a step toward a "Buy French Act"?), and&#13;
the EC Commission has attacked it, as requested by Italian and German&#13;
manufacturers.&#13;
The imposition of a "prior technical visa" for imports,&#13;
ostensibly a surveillance measure, probably generates a temporary&#13;
decrease in imports that lasts until importers become accustomed to&#13;
filling out the import declaration forms needed to obtain a technical&#13;
visa.&#13;
Summary&#13;
The free trade choice of France has often been reasserted,&#13;
particularly by Prime Minister Raynaud Barre. However, it is certain&#13;
than when trade diversion becomes important for a product, the French&#13;
administration will ask for protection, as French governments have&#13;
repeatedly  asserted.     As  elsewhere,   protectionist  pressures  from&#13;
industries are strong, and they find support in the political system.&#13;
In the former parliamentary majority, the UDF (Giscard d'Estaing's&#13;
party) was free trade-oriented, while the RPR (the former Gaullist&#13;
party)  was  mainly  protection-oriented.    In  the  new majority, the&#13;
Socialist party is free trade-oriented, with a rather important&#13;
protectionist fringe; the Communist Party is protection-oriented.&#13;

V CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Because of the fast, recent changes in French specialization&#13;
and because of its capital goods exports, particularly to the developing&#13;
countries, France cannot afford to close itself to foreign trade.&#13;
However, protectionist pressures remain strong and find support among&#13;
the public and some politicians.     A special factor is the "bureaus,"&#13;
which have traditionally played a leading role in running the French&#13;
state. As stressed by another paper in this volume,l/ it is likely that&#13;
their role in trade policy favors protectionism.&#13;
The major political changes which occurred in 1981 may increase&#13;
the danger of a slide into protectionism.        France will make strong&#13;
efforts to obtain concessions from countries such as Japan, with which&#13;
it has a large bilateral deficit 'and will feel that it should retaliate&#13;
strongly against restrictions imposed by such countries as the United&#13;
States, which seem to French officials to be more protectionist than&#13;
France.    The  current  fashionable  "drive  to recapture the domestic&#13;
market" has caused concern even among France's EC partners, although the&#13;
government has asserted that it will not violate EC rules against trade&#13;
restrictions between member countries.&#13;
The extension of the nationalized sector will have an impact on&#13;
trade, and the system of assistance to industry will be reformed.&#13;

Protection -- Reflections of a Continental European," World Bank&#13;

France will adopt a more protectionist stance within the EC. However,&#13;
the priorities, in particular those in favor of high technology sectors,&#13;
are not new, the structure of the trade balance does not permit any very&#13;
fast moves, and EC rules will serve as a brake on a major shift in&#13;
policy.&#13;
In conclusion, more protectionist attitudes can be expected, on&#13;
a moderate scale, and a sharp move away from what is, after all, a&#13;
strikingly open trading system is improbable.&#13;

            A project to establish the shares of
            industrial country markets held by the developing countries,
            changes in such shares in the 1970s, and reasons for
            variations among industry groups and countries aims to
            assist developing and industrial countries improve their
            policies through a better understanding of trade patterns
            and protectionist pressures. This paper examines trade
            policy in France and the tools, particularly public
            subsidies, used to support industry. The evolution and
            nature of France's international commerce and its trade
            policy are examined. Attention is paid to the institutional
            structure through which trade policy is decided and
            implemented. The paper concludes by assessing probable
            future trends. Trade will continue to be important to
            France's economy, but protectionist pressure will
            probably remain strong, supported by the public and the bureaus.
