             of basic industry is included in the second five rear plan of i&#13;

             India.   It started on April 1st this year.    The second five&#13;
             year plan follows or is an outgrowth of the first five year&#13;
             plan which is being considered as a success.     There is an   over~&#13;

             the last two years or three reached about f'our percent a year.!&#13;
             It 11 hoped it vill increase to about five percent a year in&#13;
        1;   the second five year plan.&#13;
        '!&#13;
         1        This overall increase vas achieved not only by investment:&#13;
             in the public sector but also by investment through the economy,&#13;
                                                                                  I&#13;

             a great part of it in the private sector.&#13;

            of the first plan.       The first plan emphasized mostly increase1&#13;
            production of agriculture.  The second places a great emphasis!&#13;
                                                                           l&#13;

            penditures proposed amounting to nearly one-half of the total           i&#13;
            as compared with less than one-third in the first five year&#13;
            plan.&#13;
                                                                                        i&#13;
                    Industry is expected to be expanded in nearly all   import~nt&#13;
            sectors, also in the private sector including coal, steel,&#13;
            textiles, chemicals, aluminum, paper, sugar.&#13;

                    As a whole, it may be said that the private sector in           I&#13;
                                                                                    I&#13;
            industry at the end of the second five year plan will be         large~,&#13;
                                                                                        t&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
            much larger than the public sector.&#13;
                    With regard to balance of payments in the first five ye~&#13;
        "                                                                               !&#13;

&#13;
            parments developed favorably.       However, because of the changed&#13;
            composition of imports in the second tive year plan--it vill        J,  I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            much more imports of equipment, machiners rolling stock and&#13;
            steel--there is to be expected aÂ· greater strain on India's&#13;
       I    balance of pa:yments, and, therefore, India will need more ex-&#13;

                    Oomi~g   nov to the project, I should like to say that   thi~&#13;
                                                                                    i&#13;

            project ts among the most important industrial projects in the&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                4&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             industrial unit in India, with very good f"urther expansion&#13;
             potentialities.     It will represent an important contribution&#13;
             to the whole of India's eeonomy.     Foreign exchange savings re-i&#13;
                                                                                    i&#13;
             sulting from the project will amount to about $50 a year.&#13;
                                                                                    i&#13;
                  In this connection, if one considers the yearly amount ofi&#13;
             service on this loan ot about $4.1 million, one can say that&#13;
             this amount certainly vas in Indtaâ&#128;¢s capacity to service.&#13;
                  With regard to loan documents, these are basically in the&#13;
             customary form.     There are some difterenoes which are outlined!&#13;
             in the President's report.                                             I&#13;
                  One interesting feature of it is that the loan vtll have      I&#13;
             a trust deed constituting first mortgage and floating charge&#13;
             on the company's assets.     However, the execution of the trust&#13;
             deed will not be a condition of eftectivenss.&#13;
                  The loan can be made effective before the trust deed ts&#13;
        'i   executed, and the trust deed must be executed by tne end of&#13;
             Janua:ry 1957.    At that time, the company vill be entitled to&#13;
                                                                                !&#13;
             draw on the loan to the amount of $25 million, and as a featu1'!&#13;
             ot this loan the trust deed or the mortgage ts open end for&#13;
       :! 13-1/2 million dollars tor issue or the debentures or other&#13;
             obligations on tel'Uls and conditions to be agreed by the Bank.&#13;
                  There a.re rev conditions of eftecttveness, which, as we&#13;
             reel, can be completed within three months.     One of them con-&#13;
             cerns the supply of additional power.     We know by nov the rNC&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           5&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
         has confirmed all the additional power which will be needed&#13;
         will be supplied on time.&#13;
                 On this last item, transportation, we have received&#13;
         assurances from the Government of India that they vill assign&#13;
         high priorities to transportation investment operations in&#13;
          this area so that the operation ot the steel mills should not&#13;
         be hampered by transportation difficulties or transportation&#13;
         delays.&#13;

              THE CHAIRMAN:     Five million dollars.       But there will be--i&#13;
                                                                                  i&#13;
              MR. OVERBY:     Germany will have made available full 18 per~&#13;
                                                                                  !&#13;
         cent in one way or another.&#13;
              THE CHAIRMAN:     That is right.&#13;
              MR. OVERBY:     Fine.   Somebody made it.                           I&#13;
&#13;
              MR. WARREN:     Would someone say a word about the retention\&#13;
                                                                                  I&#13;
         price system?   I am sure it is all covered here, but I am not&#13;
         sure I understood it.&#13;
              THE CHAIRMAN:    Mr. Rembert.&#13;
                                                                                  I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              MR. REMBERT:     Iron and steel prices in India are Â·controlltd,&#13;
         and the prices are set in much the same way as power rates are&#13;
         normally set, allowtng all expenses, depreciation, taxes, and&#13;
         a reasonable return on the investment.&#13;
              This practice has been followed since the end of the war.&#13;
         The only change that has been instituted recently has been the&#13;
         allowance of a development, an amount for development which is&#13;
         equivalent to about 50 rupees per ton, and the company is free&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              11&#13;
&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
             to take that and use that money tor investment.&#13;
                  Another item which is included in the retention price is&#13;
             a contribution to the equalization fund which has been used&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
             in the past to equalize prices between domestic production andj&#13;
             imports so that the uniform price is given in the country, andi       !&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             in 1951 that amount vas increased to provide some funds which&#13;
             the Government loaned to India Iron and Steel and Tata for&#13;
             expansion purposes.&#13;
                  THE CHAIRMAN:     Any other questions?&#13;
                  MR. BURY:     What is regarded as a reasonable rate or re-&#13;
             turn investment apart trom vhat is allowed tor--&#13;
                  MR. REMBERT:     In the past, it has been fixed tor about&#13;
             eight percent on what is known as the block.       But I might say    1&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
&#13;
             that the block includes the total investment of the company,&#13;
             including housing and all service factors.&#13;
                  THE CHAIRMAN:     Any other questions?&#13;
                                                                                   '&#13;
                  MR. WARREN:     'Why does the retention price tall during thei&#13;
             period?   Is that because   or   the decline in costs?&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
                 MR. REMBERT:      No, that is part of the present arrangement1.&#13;
                                                                                   !&#13;
                                                                                   i&#13;
             In other words, they have an agreed retention price subject to:&#13;
             1960, and then the arrangement is that it vi 11 fall thereafter:,&#13;
                                                                                   !&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             unless there are necessary adjustments on vages.&#13;
                                                                                   I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 MR. WARREN:   It there are upward changes in cost, this is!&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
             taken into consideration?&#13;
