&#13;
   Box 2: Hedging Strategy and Use of Derivatives&#13;
   IBRD is a financial intermediary, borrowing funds in international capital markets for on-lending to member countries. In&#13;
   order to achieve the lowest funding costs, IBRD issues bonds in those currencies and markets throughout the world in&#13;
   which it has a comparative funding cost advantage. As a matter of policy, IBRD avoids interest rate risk in its financing&#13;
   operations and avoids open foreign exchange risk positions. Therefore, both on a transaction-by-transaction basis and&#13;
   on a portfolio basis, IBRD enters into derivatives transactions to eliminate mismatches between the interest rate and cur-&#13;
   rency composition of its assets and liabilities. This approach insulates IBRD's balance sheet from material interest rate or&#13;
   currency exposure. (See Section 6 - Financial Risk Management)&#13;
&#13;
   FAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market, with the effects of those changes reflected in the balance&#13;
   sheet and income statement. The recorded value of derivatives will therefore increase or decrease depending on move-&#13;
   ments of market interest rates and other factors. For example, IBRD has a large portfolio of derivatives that convert long-&#13;
   dated fixed-rate borrowings into floating-rate obligations. In general, when market interest rates increase, the reported&#13;
   value of these derivatives will decline; similarly, declining interest rates will result in an increase in the value of these&#13;
   derivatives. Although these derivatives economically offset other financial positions on bonds and loans, those positions&#13;
   are generally not marked to market, so their reported values are not affected by interest rate movements. Thus, an&#13;
   asymmetry results when the value of economically offsetting transactions are reported on different bases.&#13;
&#13;
   FAS 133 contains hedge accounting provisions which are intended to mitigate this mismatch but in order to qualify for&#13;
   hedge accounting, transactions must meet particular criteria. A number of the tools that IBRD utilizes would not qualify&#13;
   for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, IBRD has elected not to define any qualifying hedge relationships. While&#13;
   IBRD's policies and hedging strategy achieve its risk minimization objectives, that result is not fully evident in the&#13;
   reported financial statements, because the derivatives and the underlying liabilities/assets that they hedge would typi-&#13;
   cally be reported on different bases under FAS 133. For management reporting purposes, IBRD instead uses current&#13;
   value financial statements, as shown in Table 2 in Section 2, which marks both the derivatives and the underlying liabili-&#13;
   ties and assets to market.&#13;
&#13;
   In FY2002 and FY2003 interest rates for most currencies were declining. Accordingly, application of FAS 133 in FY2002&#13;
   and FY2003 resulted in reported net income being substantially higher than it would otherwise have been (by $854 mil-&#13;
   lion and $2,323 million, respectively). Conversely, application of FAS 133 in FY2004 in a rising interest rate environment&#13;
   resulted in a net loss on a reported basis (including a loss of $4,100 million due to application of FAS 133). Both the pos-&#13;
   itive and the negative FAS 133 adjustments reflect the impact of changing rates on the marked-to-market value of the&#13;
   derivatives, which represent only one side of hedged transactions. The impact of changing market rates on the other&#13;
   side of hedged transactions - the underlying liabilities or assets - generally is not reflected in the reported financial state-&#13;
   ments. Therefore, IBRD uses current value financial statements for management reporting purposes and focuses on&#13;
   operating income in its annual allocation and distribution decisions.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
  Box 3: Lending Operations Principles&#13;
&#13;
  (i) IBRD makes loans to governments, governmental authorities or private enterprises in the territories&#13;
       of member countries. A loan that is not made directly to the member in whose territories the&#13;
       project is located must be guaranteed as to principal, interest and other charges by the member or&#13;
       its central bank or a comparable agency of the member acceptable to IBRD. A guarantee by the&#13;
       member itself has been obtained in all such cases to date.&#13;
&#13;
  (ii) IBRD's loans are designed to promote the use of resources for productive purposes in its member&#13;
       countries. Projects financed by IBRD loans are required to meet IBRD's standards for technical,&#13;
       economic, financial, institutional and environmental soundness.&#13;
&#13;
  (iii)In making loans, IBRD must act prudently and pay due regard to the prospects of repayment. Deci-&#13;
       sions to make loans are based upon, among other things, studies by IBRD of a member country's&#13;
       economic structure, including assessments of its resources and ability to generate sufficient foreign&#13;
       exchange to meet debt-service obligations.&#13;
&#13;
  (iv)IBRD must be satisfied that in the prevailing market conditions (taking into account the member's&#13;
       overall external financing requirements), the borrower would be unable to obtain financing under&#13;
       conditions which, in the opinion of IBRD, are reasonable for the borrower. IBRD is intended to&#13;
       promote private investment, not to compete with it.&#13;
&#13;
  (v)The use of loan proceeds is supervised. IBRD makes arrangements to ensure that funds loaned are&#13;
       used only for authorized purposes and, where relevant, with due attention to considerations of cost-&#13;
       effectiveness. This policy is enforced primarily by requiring borrowers (a) to submit documentation&#13;
       establishing, to IBRD's satisfaction, that the expenditures financed with the proceeds of loans are&#13;
       made in conformity with the applicable lending agreements and (b) to maximize competition in the&#13;
       procurement of goods and services by using, wherever possible, international competitive bidding&#13;
       or, when it is not appropriate, other procedures that ensure maximum economy and efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
At June 30, 2004, the total volume of outstanding            Figure 1: Commitments by Region&#13;
loans was $109,610 million, $6,630 million lower&#13;
                                                                                      6,000&#13;

    b.   Average Maturity - Multicurrency loans. IBRD maintains a targeted currency composition in its multicurrency loans. The present target&#13;
         ratio is one U.S. dollar for every 125 Japanese yen and one euro. These three major currencies comprise at least 90% of the multicurrency&#13;
         loans' U.S. dollar equivalent value, with the remainder in other currencies. The composition of the multicurrency loans is affected by the&#13;
         selection of currencies for disbursements on those loans and by the currencies selected for the billing of the principal repayments. Along with&#13;
         the selection of disbursement currencies, IBRD manages the selection of repayment currencies to maintain the alignment of the multicur-&#13;
         rency loans' composition with the target ratio. The selection of currencies for repayment billing by IBRD precludes the determination of aver-&#13;
         age maturity information for multicurrency loans by individual currency. Accordingly, IBRD only discloses the maturity periods for its&#13;
         multicurrency loans on a combined U.S. dollars equivalent basis.&#13;
