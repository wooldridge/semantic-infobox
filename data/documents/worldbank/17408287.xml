This Report has been prepared by a team led by Roumeen Islam and comprising Arup Banerji, Robert Cull,&#13;
Asli DemirgÃ¼c-Kunt, Simeon Djankov, Alexander Dyck, Aart Kraay, Caralee McLiesh, Russell Pittman; and&#13;
Helena Tang, Nazmul Chaudhury, Jeffrey Hammer, Richard Messick, and Tatiana Nenova made additional&#13;
contributions. The team was assisted by Theodora Galabova, Paramjit Gill, Yifan Hu, Olga Ioffe, Claudio&#13;
Montenegro, Stefka Slavova, Mahesh Surendran, and LiHong Wang. Andrei Shleifer and Joseph E. Stiglitz&#13;
provided valuable suggestions during the writing of the Report. Bruce Ross-Larson is the editor of the&#13;
overview, chapter 1, and chapter 10. Andrew Balls provided editorial assistance. The work was carried out&#13;
under the general direction of Nicholas Stern.&#13;
   The team was advised by a panel of experts comprising Carl Anduri, Abhijit Banerjee, Kaushik Basu, Tim-&#13;
othy Besley, FranÃ§ois Bourguignon, Antonio Estache, Cheryl Gray, Avner Greif, Nurul Islam, Emmanuel&#13;
Jimenez, Daniel Kaufmann, Michael Klein, Yingyi Qian, and Kenneth Sokoloff.&#13;
   Many others inside and outside the World Bank provided helpful comments and wrote background papers&#13;
and other contributions, and their names are listed in the bibliographical note. Much of the background re-&#13;
search was supported by a generous grant from the Dutch government. Research was also supported by the&#13;
Swiss Trust Fund. The World Bank Development Data Group contributed to the data appendix and was re-&#13;
sponsible for the Selected World Development Indicators.&#13;
   The team undertook a wide range of consultations for this Report, from the initial outline to the final&#13;
draft. During the Reportâ&#128;&#153;s planning stage in 2000, a February workshop in Berlin and a July workshop in&#13;
Washington, D.C. provided an exchange of ideas among academics and policymakers from around the world.&#13;
During the drafting stage in 2001, a consultative meeting on the media was held in April, and a consultative&#13;
meeting on judicial systems was held in May. In addition, the authors held consultations with a wider com-&#13;
munity that included nongovernmental organizations, holding meetings in Paris (with representatives from&#13;
the French Conseil dâ&#128;&#153; Ã&#137;tat, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the French De-&#13;
velopment Agency, and the Competition Council); in London (Department for International Development,&#13;
Overseas Development Institute, and nongovernmental organizations); and in Amsterdam (Amsterdam Insti-&#13;
tute for International Development). The team also conducted a series of videoconferences with audiences in&#13;
Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, South Africa, and Thailand. A consultation with the In-&#13;
ternational Confederation of Free Trade Unions was also held.&#13;
   Rebecca Sugui served as executive assistant to the team; Leila Search as program assistant and technical&#13;
support; and Shannon Hendrickson, Joanna Kata-Blackman, Mei-Ling Lavecchia, and Rudeewan Laohakit-&#13;
tikul as team assistants. Maria Ameal and later Eva Santo Domingo served as resource management assistant.&#13;
   Book design, editing, and production were coordinated by the Production Services Unit of the World&#13;

What are institutions?&#13;
&#13;
    Institutions are rules, enforcement mechanisms, and orga-           and public and private organizations operating under public&#13;
    nizations. This Report considers those institutions that sup-       law. For example, organizations include firms operating&#13;
    port market transactions.2 Distinct from policies, which are        under corporate law. Informal institutions, often operating&#13;
    the goals and desired outcomes, institutions are the rules,         outside the formal legal system, reflect unwritten codes of&#13;
    including behavioral norms, by which agents interactâ&#128;&#148;and            social conduct. Examples include land inheritance norms&#13;
    the organizations that implement rules and codes of conduct         and moneylenders using social networks to determine cred-&#13;
    to achieve desired outcomes. Policies affect which institu-         itworthiness based on the reputation of the agents involved.&#13;

Institutional evolution and economic development: private traders and public rulers&#13;

  In medieval Europe, the political power of local rulers was ex-       among traders, and increased problems of information and en-&#13;

  traders from other regions without incurring penalties. In re-        social and ethnic backgrounds, which meant that social con-&#13;

  established agreements with merchants in foreign cities and                Members no longer wanted to be collectively responsible&#13;

      In the 12th century, traders in Europe established commu-         of the community. But the extent to which communities could&#13;

recent evidence indicates that greater state ownership of                    can bring about increased competition as credit is in-&#13;

  Concessions (or franchises) are one way to introduce private            vestments. This problem affected privatization of the electricity&#13;

    Why is state ownership much more prevalent in                             the media freedom indexes; they also transmit much&#13;

    Indicators 2001 (WDI) covers the full range of de-      organizations such as the United Nations and its spe-&#13;
velopment data produced by the World Bank. The four         cialized agencies, the International Monetary Fund&#13;
main tables included here retain the layout of earlier      (IMF), and the OECD. Although international stan-&#13;
editions of the Selected World Development Indica-          dards of coverage, definition, and classification apply&#13;
tors, presenting comparative socioeconomic data for         to most statistics reported by countries and interna-&#13;
more than 130 economies for the most recent year for        tional agencies, there are inevitably differences in&#13;
which data are available and, for some indicators, for      timeliness and reliability arising from differences in&#13;
an earlier year. An additional table presents basic indi-   the capabilities and resources devoted to basic data&#13;
cators for 75 economies with sparse data or with popu-      collection and compilation. For some topics, compet-&#13;
lations of less than 1.5 million.                           ing sources of data require review by World Bank staff&#13;

            World development report 2002 : building
            institutions for markets
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Development Report (WDR) 2002
            is about building market institutions that promote growth
            and reduce poverty, addressing how institutions support
            markets, what makes institutions work, and how to build
            them. This theme is a natural a natural continuation of the
            WDR 2000/01, which discussed the central role of markets in
            the lives of poor people, leaving important issues for the
            WDR 2003, which will focus on the development of human,
            natural, and environmental capital. This report emphasizes
            on building institutions to support the development of
            markets, and its main messages address supplying effective
            institutions, and creating the demand for them, through: a
            design that complements institutions, human capabilities,
            and available technologies; innovations that identify
            institutional successes, and weaknesses, by experimenting
            with, and recognizing local conditions, and differences,
            ranging from social norms, to geography; a connection of
            communities of market players, by opening information flows,
            and trade; and, the promotion of competition among
            jurisdictions, firms, and individuals. The report is an
            introspective analysis about how do institutions support
            markets, growth, and poverty reduction, defining
            institutional work as a channel of information about market
            conditions, goods, and participants; as a mean to enforce
            property rights, and contracts; and, as a tool to increase
            competition in markets. The report offers lessons derived
            from experience in institutional evolution, and, although it
            does not address all possible institutional problems, it
            does focus on sets of institutions from many fields, to show
            that the framework, and messages can be applied regardless
            of the sector.
