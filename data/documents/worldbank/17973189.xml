&#13;
Q:      I'm Jochen Kraske, the Bank's historian.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      I am William Becker with the Business History Group and&#13;
&#13;
the George Washington University.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I am Jorunn Maehlum, Executive Director of the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It's a pleasure to meet you.&#13;
&#13;
A:      It's good to be here.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      We would like to begin this interview by asking you how&#13;
&#13;
you became interested in the area of economic development?&#13;
&#13;
A:      My interest goes back many years.     It first started when&#13;
&#13;
I was in high school.     I spent my last year as an exchange&#13;
&#13;
student in Illinois, and from that time forward,       I was keenly&#13;
&#13;
interested in international issues.        I then went to the&#13;
&#13;
University in Oslo.     I received a degree in languages, but&#13;
&#13;
all through my university education I maintained an interest&#13;
&#13;
in international issues.        When I wanted to find a career, I&#13;
&#13;
explored those institutions in Norway which were dealing with&#13;
&#13;
developing countries and with international issues.        I&#13;
&#13;
started to work in our bilateral aid agency NORAD, in 1974.&#13;
&#13;
I worked there for about ten years on bilateral development&#13;
&#13;
aid.     After that, I switched to multilateral development aid&#13;
&#13;
and worked there for another ten years.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Maehlum, Page 2&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In these positions, both in the bilateral and the&#13;
&#13;
multilateral aid agencies, what countries did you deal with?&#13;
&#13;
A:   At first,   I worked on recruitment issues.     I tried to&#13;
&#13;
identify NORAD personnel who could work on Norwegian aid&#13;
&#13;
projects in the developing countries.       I did that for a&#13;
&#13;
couple of years, and then I worked in NORAD's resident&#13;
&#13;
mission in Tanzania for two years.    While I was there, I&#13;
&#13;
worked with different sectors.    I was involved in the energy&#13;
&#13;
sector quite a bit.    I was also involved in university&#13;
&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
     After I came back from Tanzania in '81, I worked a&#13;
&#13;
little bit with recruitment again.    Eventually, I began to&#13;
&#13;
take on more general policy responsibilities, eventually&#13;
&#13;
working with the Director General of NORAD.       I did that until&#13;
&#13;
I switched to the multilateral field.       In short, my work&#13;
&#13;
touched on a variety of development issues and geographical&#13;
&#13;
regions.    Perhaps it has been more focused on Africa since I&#13;
&#13;
was in Tanzania for a couple of years, but it covered all the&#13;
&#13;
different aspects of our bilateral development program.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Is two years the normal assignment for someone in your&#13;
&#13;
position, in a place like Tanzania?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.    You must stay for two years.     Then you have the&#13;
&#13;
opportunity to extend your tenure.    Now, being a woman and&#13;
&#13;
having a family always makes things a little more&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 3&#13;
complicated, and when you have two careers you have to&#13;
&#13;
compromise a bit more.    In my situation, it wasn't fair to my&#13;
&#13;
husband to stay longer than two years.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What is your assessment not only of the two years that&#13;
&#13;
you were in Tanzania but, more generally, of Norway's&#13;
&#13;
contribution to development in Tanzania?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Tanzania was one of the first countries where Norway did&#13;
&#13;
a significant amount of development work.     In the early 60's,&#13;
&#13;
we wanted to focus on only a few east African countries&#13;
&#13;
because we had limited resources.    Practical considerations&#13;
&#13;
guided the priorities of Norway very much at the time.       In&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania's case, I also think that, in the beginning, we felt&#13;
&#13;
that the leadership had a development philosophy which we&#13;
&#13;
could support.   Their goal was to achieve economic growth&#13;
&#13;
with equal distribution of their wealth.    They wanted to&#13;
&#13;
build a society where everybody could grow.    This was very&#13;
&#13;
consistent with our Nordic philosophy, and I think that this&#13;
&#13;
consistency created the basis for a very close relationship&#13;
&#13;
between Norway and Tanzania.    I think that enhanced the&#13;
&#13;
dialogue when we talked about projects.&#13;
&#13;
     At the same time, however, we weren't always as critical&#13;
&#13;
as we should have been.   We didn't ask enough tough&#13;
&#13;
questions.   Looking back, I realize now that some of our&#13;
&#13;
projects in Tanzania were white elephants from the beginning,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Maehlum, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
but we had difficulty conveying that message to the&#13;
&#13;
Tanzanians.     This situation continued throughout parts of the&#13;
&#13;
Eighties.     Although we believed that Tanzania's basic&#13;
&#13;
development philosophy was sound, we also realized that the&#13;
&#13;
Tanzanians had to take some tough measures on the economic&#13;
&#13;
front.     It took time before Norway and the Nordics arrived at&#13;
&#13;
this conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
     Nevertheless, we did the best we could do at the time.&#13;
&#13;
However,    I do appreciate the fact that what we considered a&#13;
&#13;
successful project in Tanzania during the early Eighties&#13;
&#13;
would not be as highly regarded today.     Different objectives&#13;
&#13;
came to the agenda.&#13;
&#13;
     At one time, for instance, I recall that there was a&#13;
&#13;
NORAD project where the emphasis was very much on the&#13;
&#13;
effective use of Norwegian funds.     We wanted to follow the&#13;
&#13;
monies from Oslo to Tanzania and to the recipient.        In order&#13;
&#13;
to make sure that it actually happened, we set up a separate&#13;
&#13;
administrative unit.     Norwegian staff came into Tanzania,&#13;
&#13;
became responsible for the unit and monitored the&#13;
&#13;
disbursement of funds.     Right after I came back from&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania, this program was used as an example of a successful&#13;
&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
     Some years later, the issue was not so much setting up&#13;
&#13;
your own administrative unit in the field, but more building&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Maehlum, Page 5&#13;
&#13;
up the Tanzanian capacity and working through their system.&#13;
&#13;
As a result, the very same project was regarded as a failure&#13;
&#13;
simply because the standards changed.     This makes it&#13;
&#13;
difficult to assess whether what we did throughout the&#13;
&#13;
Seventies and early Eighties has been a success or not.&#13;
&#13;
     Obviously Tanzania has not progressed as well as we&#13;
&#13;
would like.    We cannot run away from responsibility for how&#13;
&#13;
things have progressed, but we also cannot be afraid to learn&#13;
&#13;
from our mistakes.     We must do what we think is best at the&#13;
&#13;
time, evaluate the results, and adjust our activities&#13;
&#13;
accordingly.     Changing standards have made this process more&#13;
&#13;
difficult.     Yesterday's success becomes today's failure.     The&#13;
&#13;
project hasn't changed; the values changed.&#13;
&#13;
     I also think that we did not give enough attention to&#13;
&#13;
the aid dependency issue in the early Eighties.     That issue&#13;
&#13;
became important in the late Eighties, not least when the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, in the long-term perspective study for Africa,&#13;
&#13;
discussed this issue for the first time.     Bear in mind,&#13;
&#13;
however, that you couldn't talk about aid-dependency in the&#13;
&#13;
beginning of the Eighties.     It was not a legitimate issue.&#13;
&#13;
Although we had a plan to go in and start something, we did&#13;
&#13;
not have a clear plan on how to transfer the responsibility&#13;
&#13;
to the Tanzanians so they could take over.&#13;
&#13;
     The aid-dependency issue reminds me of when president&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Maehlum, Page 6&#13;
&#13;
Clinton talks about having an entry policy and an exit policy&#13;
&#13;
for his foreign affairs.     We only had an entry policy.     We&#13;
&#13;
very rarely, at that time, had an exit policy.      We thought&#13;
&#13;
that we should, but, we really didn't think about it that&#13;
&#13;
much.     We didn't think about what we could do to reduce&#13;
&#13;
overdependency in some areas.     We have learned a lot since&#13;
&#13;
then.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You mentioned that energy was an area that you were&#13;
&#13;
interested in.     Did you do anything related to energy in&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.   I worked on some large hydroelectric projects, one&#13;
&#13;
of them was eventually branded as a white elephant.&#13;
&#13;
        I don't know if you recall the Stiegler's Gorge project.&#13;
&#13;
It was a huge hydropower project.     We looked at Tanzania's&#13;
&#13;
need for electric power and came to the conclusion that the&#13;
&#13;
project would be too large.     Tanzania needed power, but not&#13;
&#13;
this much power.     However, this project had evolved into a&#13;
&#13;
national priority project.     When I referred to the change in&#13;
&#13;
the dialogue between Tanzania and Norway, it was very much&#13;
&#13;
linked to this specific project because that was, I believe,&#13;
&#13;
one of the very first occasions that we had to try to convey&#13;
&#13;
the message to the Tanzanians that they might have to put a&#13;
&#13;
project on the shelf even though a lot of money had gone into&#13;
&#13;
its preparation.      This was a difficult thing to ask because&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Maehlum, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
we did have a very close relationship.     Nevertheless, we were&#13;
&#13;
able to convince them.     I'm convinced that it was the right&#13;
&#13;
decision, yet the Stiegler's Gorge project stands as an&#13;
&#13;
example of the Tanzanian authorities having a different set&#13;
&#13;
of priorities.    Eventually, we forged a consensus in favor of&#13;
&#13;
shelving it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You suggested that there is a distinctive Nordic point&#13;
&#13;
of view on development issues.     From this perspective, how&#13;
&#13;
would you assess the Bank's approach to Africa?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I think that the Bank is very good at analyzing&#13;
&#13;
country-specific situations and putting data on the table.       I&#13;
&#13;
think that the Bank should be given credit for bringing&#13;
&#13;
crucial issues and challenges to the forefront.     The long-&#13;
&#13;
term perspectives study for Africa is a very important&#13;
&#13;
document that has shaped the thinking of the donors as well&#13;
&#13;
as the Bank.     However, I have also sensed that the Bank tends&#13;
&#13;
to be too theoretical in its approach to development&#13;
&#13;
generally and also specifically in Africa.     I feel that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank would have a better command of development issues if it&#13;
&#13;
had a stronger field presence that could help it to&#13;
&#13;
understand Africa's political economy a bit better.&#13;
&#13;
     I think that the Bank had (and still has) a tendency to&#13;
&#13;
try to look at models which work well in theory, but don't&#13;
&#13;
always work well in reality.     I give the Bank a lot of credit&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Maehlum, Page 8&#13;
&#13;
for trying to analyze the situation and trying to come up&#13;
&#13;
with a solution, but I would have liked to see (and I still&#13;
&#13;
would like to see) much more pragmatism in the Bank's work in&#13;
&#13;
Africa.   The Bank needs to be open to different approaches.&#13;
&#13;
It has to be more patient when policies are changed, and when&#13;
&#13;
difficult economic issues need to be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
     I think the whole issue of political economy has been&#13;
&#13;
underemphasized in the Bank.   The Bank needs to spend more&#13;
&#13;
time looking at a nation's political and social environment.&#13;
&#13;
While Norway didn't focus enough on economic issues, I think&#13;
&#13;
the Bank has been focusing on them a little bit too much.&#13;
&#13;
Both the Bank and the Nordics need to strike a balance&#13;
&#13;
between socio-political and economic considerations.     In both&#13;
&#13;
cases, I feel that the pendulum is swinging toward a comfort&#13;
&#13;
zone, as the Bank pays more attention to its members' social&#13;
&#13;
and political environment, and the Nordics are more attuned&#13;
&#13;
to economic issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How do you see the Bank modifying itself?     By changing&#13;
&#13;
its analysis? changing its prescription? changing the focus&#13;
&#13;
of its lending?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Not by changing its analysis but by being more open to&#13;
&#13;
different strategies in different countries, depending upon&#13;
&#13;
the political and social environment.   The Bank now accepts&#13;
&#13;
that certain countries require a gradual reform process while&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Maehlum, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
others need to be pushed harder.      In Mozambique, for example,&#13;
&#13;
The Bank is not pushing as hard on privatization as in some&#13;
&#13;
other countries.     It realizes that in order to improve&#13;
&#13;
efficiency it may be helpful to do something with government&#13;
&#13;
entities (in the short term at least), and look at the&#13;
&#13;
various options in a more pragmatic way.&#13;
&#13;
        I think that I've seen too many examples of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
pushing too hard on some of these issues in order to follow&#13;
&#13;
certain prescriptions.      Even if the prescription&#13;
&#13;
theoretically is the right one, if you push too hard too&#13;
&#13;
fast,   it might not yield results.    Quite often, it has to be&#13;
&#13;
applied gradually over a longer period of time.        The Bank&#13;
&#13;
frequently pushes too hard for reforms within a very short&#13;
&#13;
period of time, which is not possible in the political-social&#13;
&#13;
context of many African countries.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Do you feel that the Bank, in that sense, preempts&#13;
&#13;
others also from doing the right thing, since Norway would&#13;
&#13;
still take a different perspective of what should be done and&#13;
&#13;
what the priorities are?      Do you feel that Norway is being&#13;
&#13;
preempted by the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, yes and no.   Norway follows its own line.    If it&#13;
&#13;
feels that the Bank is pushing too hard, for instance, for&#13;
&#13;
privatization, they will just keep out of that and try to&#13;
&#13;
focus on something else.      On the other hand, when everybody&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 10&#13;
&#13;
wants to try to have more donor coordination and more joint&#13;
&#13;
work, I think that the Bank will influence what Norway and&#13;
&#13;
the Nordics are doing and that has its positives and&#13;
&#13;
negatives.     From time to time, there have been (and there&#13;
&#13;
still are) different views on these issues between Norway and&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, and I think that's understandable.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would you say that the level of frustration is&#13;
&#13;
increasing or that these disagreements have more or less&#13;
&#13;
always been at the same decibel level?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think that there is a convergence of views about what&#13;
&#13;
should be done, but there is not always the same opinion&#13;
&#13;
about how it should be done.     For instance, both parties&#13;
&#13;
recognize that structural reform is necessary.       This&#13;
&#13;
consensus didn't exist in the beginning of the Eighties.         But&#13;
&#13;
the Bank and the Nordics might have different views on the&#13;
&#13;
pace and sequencing of structural reform.&#13;
&#13;
     There is a small vocal group in Norway who has always&#13;
&#13;
been very much against the Bank's work, and that group is&#13;
&#13;
still there.     They haven't changed their views.    They are&#13;
&#13;
very, very critical of basically everything the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
doing, but they talk about the same issues as they did ten&#13;
&#13;
years ago.     You can't convince them otherwise, regardless of&#13;
&#13;
the arguments you put on the table.&#13;
&#13;
     However, since the late 80's most people working on&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Maehlum, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
development issues in Norway have come closer to the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
thinking.   They recognize that a lot of the demands that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank has been putting forward are the right demands.      As I&#13;
&#13;
said, very often, its the timing and the sequencing of&#13;
&#13;
adjustment reforms which are the key issues, and also the&#13;
&#13;
social dimension.   I think that we basically pushed the Bank&#13;
&#13;
to take these issues into account.     The Bank now recognizes&#13;
&#13;
that, economic reforms hit certain groups particularly hard.&#13;
&#13;
In the beginning, the Bank never talked about that.       They&#13;
&#13;
never wanted to recognize that.    Now they do.    But it took a&#13;
&#13;
very, very long time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Moving to your career in the Bank, we'd like to ask what&#13;
&#13;
in your previous experiences best prepared you for the&#13;
&#13;
Alternate, and later, the ED position?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The ten years I spent working on bilateral assistance&#13;
&#13;
programs were quite valuable.     They brought me face to face&#13;
&#13;
with challenges in the field, and I have made good use of&#13;
&#13;
that experience.    I can relate to the issues that we talk&#13;
&#13;
about in the Board, because I have travelled extensively in&#13;
&#13;
the developing countries and lived in Tanzania for an&#13;
&#13;
extended period of time.&#13;
&#13;
     My work with multilateral institutions from 1984 to 1989&#13;
&#13;
was also quite valuable.    I familiarized myself with the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's agenda and its staff.    I admit that my Economics&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Maehlum, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
background is weak, but I have good people in my office who&#13;
&#13;
handle the more complex economic issues.   Nevertheless, I&#13;
&#13;
believe that my experience in working with both bilateral and&#13;
&#13;
multilateral development aid has been useful, and I think I&#13;
&#13;
bring to the Board a somewhat different perspective than some&#13;
&#13;
of my colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you came to the Board, what did you hope to&#13;
&#13;
accomplish?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I think that the Nordics have traditionally felt&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank should move toward a Nordic development agenda,&#13;
&#13;
and I was committed to work on that agenda from the very&#13;
&#13;
beginning.    I felt that the Bank should work on poverty&#13;
&#13;
issues and put people first.    I felt that the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
talk about equitable, sustainable growth, and targeted&#13;
&#13;
intervention.   Furthermore, I also believed that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
should support the social sectors, and address gender issues.&#13;
&#13;
In other words, my personal agenda and the Nordic agenda&#13;
&#13;
paralleled each other very closely.    I wasn't merely&#13;
&#13;
following the party line.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Your responsibilities now extended beyond the Nordic&#13;
&#13;
countries to include all of the Baltic countries.    How do you&#13;
&#13;
balance the different perspectives of the nations in your&#13;
&#13;
constituency?&#13;
A:   Well, they are very two different agendas.     The Nordic&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
agenda hasn't changed very much over the last decade or so.&#13;
&#13;
we repeat the same issues over and over again.     That's the&#13;
&#13;
only way you can bring about change in this institution.&#13;
&#13;
        Now, when the three Baltic countries became members they&#13;
&#13;
of course wanted to borrow from the Bank, and I think that we&#13;
&#13;
had to learn what that meant for our office.     we had to&#13;
&#13;
assist these countries in familiarizing themselves with the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.    We had to explain to them what the Bank could offer,&#13;
&#13;
and basically tell them that they had to establish their&#13;
&#13;
priorities and initiate a dialogue with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
        The Bank staff working on the Baltics does most of the&#13;
&#13;
work, so we generally act as facilitators between the Baltics&#13;
&#13;
and the Bank staff.     Until recently, it has not taken up a&#13;
&#13;
large proportion of our work agenda.&#13;
&#13;
        We have a new assistant from one of the Baltic&#13;
&#13;
countries.     Perhaps 10-15 percent of the office work is&#13;
&#13;
geared towards that area.     So far, the Baltics have not been&#13;
&#13;
interested in policy issues.     They have concentrated&#13;
&#13;
primarily on their own lending programs, and that means that&#13;
&#13;
they don't get involved when we get Nordic instructions.        As&#13;
&#13;
a result, we haven't had any conflicts on policy issues.&#13;
&#13;
That might come later, when they know the Bank better and&#13;
&#13;
they start to express their views.     As borrowers, the Baltics&#13;
&#13;
have different interests than the Nordics who are donors.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Maehlum, Page 14&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Can I ask about the Nordic agenda?   Do you think that&#13;
&#13;
the Bank has moved closer to the Nordic agenda over the&#13;
&#13;
course of time?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Yes, I believe that the Bank is much closer to the&#13;
&#13;
Nordic agenda now than it was in 1989.     A lot of factors have&#13;
&#13;
brought about this change.    I think that the Nordic&#13;
&#13;
constituency is one factor.   After years of repeating the&#13;
&#13;
same issues, I feel that they are finally beginning to sink&#13;
&#13;
in.   I also feel that there is an increasing number of Bank&#13;
&#13;
staff who have come to the conclusion that it is important to&#13;
&#13;
put people first, and to try to deal with some of these&#13;
&#13;
issues that we have been talking about.     This convergence of&#13;
&#13;
views between the bilaterals and the Bank has made it&#13;
&#13;
possible to bring about a consensus on several objectives.&#13;
&#13;
As I have said, there isn't always consensus about how to&#13;
&#13;
reach those objectives but, there is a consensus on the&#13;
&#13;
objectives per se.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Did you find that there was a lot of resistance in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank to moving in this direction before?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Where did this resistance come from--the President's&#13;
&#13;
office?&#13;
&#13;
A:    I don't think that the resistance was at the very top&#13;
&#13;
because Mr. Conable, who was President when I came in, had&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 15&#13;
almost the same agenda as I did.     You have to start from the&#13;
&#13;
top to bring about change in this institution.     You have to&#13;
&#13;
have a commitment from the top.     We've had that ever since I&#13;
&#13;
came, but, it takes so very long to bring about change.      In&#13;
&#13;
my view, the Bank's middle management layer was more&#13;
&#13;
conservative and restrictive to change than its upper&#13;
&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
        What I hear now when we talk about this vision paper is&#13;
&#13;
that it's the middle layer which is resisting.     It's not the&#13;
&#13;
top, and it's not the young people, but middle management.&#13;
&#13;
They seem to be the most conservative staff that we have.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Do you have any sort of sense of why there is this&#13;
&#13;
resistance to change?     After all, a lot of the middle&#13;
&#13;
management in the Bank were, at one time, young people who&#13;
&#13;
have joined the Bank and risen up.     They came with a great&#13;
&#13;
deal of enthusiasm and commitment to assist the developing&#13;
&#13;
countries.     Why would they be resistant to change?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, I think that it is a weakness in the system.   So&#13;
&#13;
many come in at the very junior level and go up through the&#13;
&#13;
ranks with all of their working experience stemming from the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     I think the institution would benefit from having more&#13;
&#13;
people with different kinds of experiences.     Furthermore, I&#13;
&#13;
also believe that the Young Professional program might have&#13;
&#13;
been good at a certain time, but I don't think it is so good&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 16&#13;
&#13;
anymore.     The same people remain here for their whole career.&#13;
&#13;
There is so little turnover and so little fresh blood coming&#13;
&#13;
in that it creates built-in resistance.&#13;
&#13;
        When you go up through the bureaucracy, you try to&#13;
&#13;
protect what you've been trying to build up, and it is easy&#13;
&#13;
to lose the sight of ways to do things differently and&#13;
&#13;
opportunities to change.     It is relatively easy to change the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's agenda so that it emphasizes infrastructure or social&#13;
&#13;
sectors, but, for instance, to change the way the staff works&#13;
&#13;
with the authorities is much more difficult.     Building up&#13;
&#13;
local capacity so that developing countries can make their&#13;
&#13;
own decisions, is a more difficult policy shift to implement&#13;
&#13;
because the staff must change the way they approach these&#13;
&#13;
development issues.     Changing the Bank's sector composition&#13;
&#13;
or lending volume is relatively easy, but changing attitudes&#13;
&#13;
within the institution is much more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What about the different points of view and the&#13;
&#13;
increasingly political orientation among the Nordic countries&#13;
&#13;
themselves?     Have they made your job more difficult?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No, because, as I said, the agenda hasn't changed that&#13;
&#13;
much.     When I came here in '89, the Bank was driven very much&#13;
&#13;
by an ideological push for the private sector, related to the&#13;
&#13;
IFC capital increase, and it was tough going.     That&#13;
&#13;
ideological bias has, for the most part, disappeared.        I feel&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              Maehlum, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
that people inside and outside the Bank realize that you need&#13;
&#13;
both good government and a private sector.   However, in 1989,&#13;
&#13;
it was difficult to talk about a legitimate role for the&#13;
&#13;
government.   I think that we played an important role in&#13;
&#13;
trying to balance that discussion.   The Americans and some of&#13;
&#13;
the others were strongly advocating private sector programs.&#13;
&#13;
The Nordics also recognized the need for a private sector,&#13;
&#13;
but they also talked about a role for the government, and&#13;
&#13;
finding the right balance between government and the private&#13;
&#13;
sector.   In recent years, the Americans have been more&#13;
&#13;
amenable to engaging in this discussion, and that has&#13;
&#13;
enhanced policy debates on this issue at the Bank immensely.&#13;
&#13;
     When I came here, it was easier to talk about the Nordic&#13;
&#13;
model as a success model.   I don't do that now.   There are&#13;
&#13;
basic questions which the Nordics themselves have to ask&#13;
&#13;
about the balance that we have.   Between the state and the&#13;
&#13;
private sector, the Nordic model is clearly in a state of&#13;
&#13;
flux and we are all, in my view, moving towards the center.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   With whom among the other EDs do you work most closely?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Issues, not geography, determine who I work with.      If I&#13;
&#13;
find EDs who share my views on specific issues, then I tend&#13;
&#13;
to work more closely with them.   Sometimes they will come&#13;
&#13;
from the developing countries, and other times they won't.&#13;
&#13;
It depends upon the individual and their views.    One of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Maehlum, Page 18&#13;
&#13;
best things about this Board is the fact that you don't have&#13;
&#13;
to think about where people come from.     You think about what&#13;
&#13;
their positions are on specific issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   One of your predecessors, Jonas Haralz, chaired an ad&#13;
&#13;
hoc committee that studied the procedures of the Board.     You&#13;
&#13;
were the Alternate at the time.     Do you think the work of the&#13;
&#13;
committee, which completed its project after he left had an&#13;
&#13;
impact on the Board?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, a very positive one, because we clearly became more&#13;
&#13;
efficient after we implemented those recommendations.     That&#13;
&#13;
was a large step in the right direction.     I've been chairing&#13;
&#13;
the second stage of that process.     We had a committee of four&#13;
&#13;
EDs looking at the Board committees, trying to improve the&#13;
&#13;
efficiency of the Board.   We finished only about a month ago.&#13;
&#13;
Our recommendations have not yet been implemented, but our&#13;
&#13;
objective was the same as Jonas Haralz's--to try to improve&#13;
&#13;
the work of the Board.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What have you found to be the problems of the&#13;
&#13;
committees?&#13;
&#13;
A:   We don't think that the basic structure and the way the&#13;
&#13;
committees are working are basically flawed, but they do need&#13;
&#13;
to be refined so that the committees can be more effective.&#13;
&#13;
We felt that the Bank should improve the interaction between&#13;
&#13;
the committees and the Board, and the committees and the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Maehlum, Page 19&#13;
management.    We also concluded that the Board should be&#13;
&#13;
involved more constructively with policies.    We have been&#13;
&#13;
trying to see how that interaction can be strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, we also recommended that we should have a&#13;
&#13;
committee looking at what we define as "development&#13;
&#13;
effectiveness issues," which we really haven't done before in&#13;
&#13;
a committee.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Earlier, you said that the problem with the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
terms of getting fresh ideas was dealing with middle&#13;
&#13;
management.    Are these in fact the people that you need to be&#13;
&#13;
working with in these committees?&#13;
&#13;
A:   We didn't have that angle.     It might have been a good&#13;
&#13;
idea to think about that, but the Board basically interacts&#13;
&#13;
with the senior management.    It's a limited group of people--&#13;
&#13;
the President, the Managing Directors, the Vice Presidents&#13;
&#13;
and the Directors.    That's about it.   The staffs of the EDs&#13;
&#13;
will interact with the staff of the Bank at all levels, so we&#13;
&#13;
get a variety of input that way.    However, on the most&#13;
&#13;
important policy issues, we focus our attention on top&#13;
&#13;
management.    All change in the Bank begins with senior&#13;
&#13;
management. The President is responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
&#13;
business of the Bank, and we (the Board) should be careful&#13;
&#13;
not to step over that line.    There is a gray area between the&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities of the Board and management, but I think&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Maehlum, Page 20&#13;
that we should try to concentrate on the important policy&#13;
&#13;
issues and not get into management issues.        If you have a&#13;
&#13;
good relationship between the Board and management then this&#13;
&#13;
is a pretty easy thing to do.     If you don't, then you more&#13;
&#13;
easily get into micromanagement.     There are, of course,&#13;
&#13;
different views on where that line should be drawn, yet our&#13;
&#13;
view has always been that we should try to limit the agenda&#13;
&#13;
of the Board to important policy issues, and leave the&#13;
&#13;
implementation to management.     Management must remain&#13;
&#13;
accountable to us, and we have some monitoring capabilities&#13;
&#13;
in order to insure that they are.     I think this division of&#13;
&#13;
labor works reasonably well.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     How have you seen this relationship evolve during the&#13;
&#13;
five years that you've been here?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, I think that during the tenure of Conable, the&#13;
&#13;
relationship with the Board was good, generally speaking.          He&#13;
&#13;
was outgoing.     He interacted with the Board.     He consulted&#13;
&#13;
with the Board.     All in all, it worked pretty well.&#13;
&#13;
       I think that Preston didn't really know what the Board&#13;
&#13;
was all about when he came to the Bank.     He basically thought&#13;
&#13;
that we were a nuisance.     We had some difficulties in the&#13;
&#13;
beginning, but I feel that the relationship is much better&#13;
&#13;
now.    I still think it can be improved, however.&#13;
&#13;
       Even if the relationship is much better than it was when&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Maehlum, Page 21&#13;
Preston came, I think that there is still a need for a closer&#13;
&#13;
interaction, and more informal contacts.      The Board and&#13;
&#13;
management need to discuss issues on a more regular basis.&#13;
&#13;
That does not take place to the extent that I would like to&#13;
&#13;
see.&#13;
&#13;
       If you want change in the institution you need a strong&#13;
&#13;
management and you need a strong Board.      Otherwise, you are&#13;
&#13;
not going to bring about change, and I think change is&#13;
&#13;
needed.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     In your work with multilateral aid, I suppose you had a&#13;
&#13;
certain exposure also to the other regional banks.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did you have the feeling that decision-making works&#13;
&#13;
better in other places than it does in the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No, I think the whole system of decision-making in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank is much better than in the regional banks and in the&#13;
&#13;
rest of the U.N. system.      Nevertheless, the Bank can still be&#13;
&#13;
improved.      Other institutions look to the Bank to see what is&#13;
&#13;
possible.      When the Nordics recommended changes in the U.N.&#13;
&#13;
system, they often suggested that the UN change its decision&#13;
&#13;
making process so that it would be more similar to the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's.       That doesn't mean that the Nordics don't think that&#13;
&#13;
improvements can take place here.       However, when compared to&#13;
&#13;
the others, the Bank is pretty well off.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Moving on to another topic, how should the Bank address&#13;
&#13;
the needs of the new members who are asking for loans?&#13;
&#13;
Specifically, I am referring to the Baltics, Eastern Europe,&#13;
&#13;
and the states of the former Soviet Union.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, I think we have to try to meet those challenges&#13;
&#13;
while continuing work in our traditional borrowing countries.&#13;
&#13;
I think that there is a clear danger that the new agenda will&#13;
&#13;
out-crowd the old agenda, and I wouldn't like that to happen.&#13;
&#13;
        I think that the Bank has to keep working in Africa with&#13;
&#13;
a lot of effort and resources while trying to take on these&#13;
&#13;
new challenges.     In order to do both during a period of slow&#13;
&#13;
institutional growth, we have to be more focused.       We might&#13;
&#13;
have to do less in each country.     We might have to do a&#13;
&#13;
better job of saying No.     We might have to give tasks to&#13;
&#13;
other organizations which might not do quite as well as the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     It might take longer, and the quantity and quality of&#13;
&#13;
work might not be as good as if the Bank had done it itself,&#13;
&#13;
but there has to be a better division of labor between all&#13;
&#13;
the actors on the scene, be it NGOs, the U.N. system, the&#13;
&#13;
bilaterals or the governments themselves.&#13;
&#13;
        I think the Bank has been taking on too much.    In order&#13;
&#13;
to meet both the new challenges and keep its traditional&#13;
&#13;
agenda, it has to become more focused and more selective.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What, then, would your priorities be, let's say, in the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
Baltics in terms of making these hard decisions?      I'm sure&#13;
&#13;
the Baltics have come with all kinds of proposals.     What&#13;
&#13;
kinds of things have you suggested that they follow up on?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, they are very satisfied with what the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
doing.     Personally, I think that the Bank is doing too much&#13;
&#13;
in too many fields.     The Bank is doing what the Baltics want&#13;
&#13;
more or less, and that's fine, but I think that they are&#13;
&#13;
trying to get into too many sectors.      I'm not sure if that's&#13;
&#13;
what the Bank should do.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     What sectors do you think the Bank should focus on?&#13;
&#13;
A:     I don't want to be Baltics-specific, but I do feel that&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's current trend toward investing in human capital is&#13;
&#13;
very important.     I also feel that the rise in lending to the&#13;
&#13;
social sectors is a positive development.&#13;
&#13;
       Furthermore, the downward trend in adjustment lending is&#13;
&#13;
also a positive sign, and there are a lot of countries coming&#13;
&#13;
out of adjustment who are being led toward investment&#13;
&#13;
lending.      I think that's very positive, even if we will have&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending, for instance, in Africa for many, many&#13;
&#13;
years.&#13;
Q:     Now, lending in general has tended to stagnate, or even&#13;
&#13;
fall back in recent years.      Is this something that concerns&#13;
&#13;
you?&#13;
A:     Yes.   This year's lending program will be the lowest in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Maehlum, Page 24&#13;
seven years, and I think that the Board was never really&#13;
&#13;
informed up-front about what was going to happen.        We never&#13;
&#13;
really discussed why this pattern of reduced lending came&#13;
&#13;
about.    Suddenly we were informed that this was going to be&#13;
&#13;
the lowest lending program in seven years.       We started asking&#13;
&#13;
why, and different explanations were given.       They are&#13;
&#13;
probably accurate, but I think that we have not had adequate&#13;
&#13;
discussion about why this pattern developed, and what impact&#13;
&#13;
it will have on the relationship between the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
borrower.&#13;
&#13;
        The first reason that the management has mentioned is&#13;
&#13;
that private capital flows were increasing dramatically for&#13;
&#13;
several countries.     That's fine, but what does that mean for&#13;
&#13;
the relationship between the borrower and the Bank?          Are we&#13;
&#13;
still going to have an influence on policies if we can't&#13;
&#13;
lend?     Is the basis of our relationship going to change?&#13;
&#13;
These things are not discussed.     I don't think that&#13;
&#13;
management involves the Board in a constructive way in&#13;
&#13;
discussing why this pattern developed and what it actually&#13;
&#13;
might mean.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Do you think that the Bank should move in a certain&#13;
&#13;
direction?     Should it grow, or hold steady?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I think that the message we get from management about&#13;
&#13;
consolidation is the right message.     However, we have to make&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Maehlum, Page 25&#13;
&#13;
sure that we have all our priorities right first.       We have to&#13;
&#13;
be selective and focused.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now, the budget system was changed two years ago.      Do&#13;
&#13;
you think the new system comes closer to your vision of the&#13;
&#13;
ideal Board/Management relationship?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes.    One of the recommendations of my committee was to&#13;
&#13;
build on those changes; to involve the Board more deeply&#13;
&#13;
through committee work; to discuss how the budget should be&#13;
&#13;
developed; and to include strategic choices in that&#13;
&#13;
discussion.       I think that those issues are going to be even&#13;
&#13;
more important in the future because we are going to have a&#13;
&#13;
zero growth budget.       There will always be new demands, so we&#13;
&#13;
will have to cut something out.       I think that this revised&#13;
&#13;
budget cycle where the committee comes in earlier is a good&#13;
&#13;
thing, because it will address my concerns in this area.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Where do you see the Board and management diverging on&#13;
&#13;
strategic issues?&#13;
&#13;
A:     It's not so easy to identify where we have different&#13;
&#13;
views.    There were clear differences between the Board and&#13;
&#13;
management, and in the Board itself over the lack of lending&#13;
&#13;
growth.       Some thought it was positive.   Others thought it was&#13;
&#13;
basically a fait accompli.       We are becoming more realistic&#13;
&#13;
now.     We are not so optimistic when it comes to a high&#13;
&#13;
lending volume, and this is a good thing.        It's not a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 26&#13;
&#13;
weakness of the Bank.     It's just more realism when it comes&#13;
&#13;
to planning and hopefully more emphasis on quality up-front.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What about issues like the relative emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
portfolio management, lending and sector work?     Is this an&#13;
&#13;
issue that would be contentious with the Board?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I think that we have been through the process of&#13;
&#13;
discussing these issues and have come to a pretty good&#13;
&#13;
consensus on most of them, yet there are still different&#13;
&#13;
views.   There are those who think that the portfolio&#13;
&#13;
performance criteria is so strict that the lending volume is&#13;
&#13;
going down and that that is wrong.    However, I don't think it&#13;
&#13;
is so controversial.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What about this perception that the Bank is a kind of&#13;
&#13;
bloated, bureaucratic, slow-moving, slow-responding&#13;
&#13;
institution?   Would you say that this is an accurate&#13;
&#13;
characterization?   If so, what do you think has to be done to&#13;
&#13;
change it?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think it is difficult to make a judgment about the&#13;
&#13;
size of the Bank.   However, I do think it is slow moving.       I&#13;
&#13;
think it is reacting very slowly to demands for change.      I've&#13;
&#13;
almost never seen any changes from the inside except for&#13;
&#13;
organizational changes.&#13;
&#13;
     It's almost as if there has to be pressure from the&#13;
&#13;
outside before you can bring about change.     It can be from&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
the NGOs or it can be from the shareholders.     Internal&#13;
&#13;
pressure rarely brings about change at the Bank.     I think&#13;
&#13;
this goes back to the staff turnover issue.     The staff gets&#13;
&#13;
so absorbed in their daily work, that they are drowning in&#13;
â&#128;¢&#13;
the day-to-day affairs.    They are basically unable to&#13;
&#13;
contemplate change.    This is unfortunate, because I think&#13;
&#13;
that this situation makes the institution very rigid.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Does the Bank respond effectively to external pressures?&#13;
&#13;
A:   On an issue like the environment, I think that there has&#13;
&#13;
been a dramatic change in the way the Bank does its business,&#13;
&#13;
basically because of outside pressure.    More staff have been&#13;
&#13;
added, and the Bank has gone a long way toward integrating&#13;
&#13;
environmental concerns in its work.     It has been a radical&#13;
&#13;
change over the last five or six years.&#13;
&#13;
     On gender, there is a change but it's very slow-going&#13;
&#13;
and it's more on the rhetorical level.     It's much, much more&#13;
&#13;
difficult to change the way the Bank is working in this field&#13;
&#13;
than in almost any other field.    It's going to take much&#13;
&#13;
longer.   Everybody relates to that issue in a very emotional&#13;
&#13;
and personal way.     It's much more difficult to bring the&#13;
&#13;
gender issue into the work of the Bank than to bring in the&#13;
&#13;
environmental issue.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What is your assessment of the Women in Development&#13;
&#13;
issue?    What work still remains to be done?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 28&#13;
A:      Well, I think that we have been able to put a policy in&#13;
&#13;
place on Women in Development.     We worked for that for three&#13;
&#13;
or four years.     The management didn't want a policy paper on&#13;
&#13;
that.     They didn't want to put anything in writing about what&#13;
&#13;
the Bank should do.&#13;
&#13;
        Norway financed at least half of that paper, and they&#13;
&#13;
have financed more than half of the Women in Development unit&#13;
&#13;
for years.     If it hadn't been for that bilateral financing,     I&#13;
&#13;
don't think anything would have happened.&#13;
&#13;
        The policy paper was put in place, and now, we are&#13;
&#13;
trying to get the regions to follow up.     I think that the&#13;
&#13;
basic framework is there.     In some countries the&#13;
&#13;
understanding and the knowledge of these issues is increasing&#13;
&#13;
quite rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
        Nevertheless, it's going to be an uphill battle for&#13;
&#13;
years and years.     The Bank should be credited for working out&#13;
&#13;
an action plan that put specific targets on a piece of paper.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, dealing with the targets, you said that the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
slow to change largely because it has this large body of&#13;
&#13;
people here who will make long careers here and probably&#13;
&#13;
don't retire very quickly.     If that is the case, how would&#13;
&#13;
you make these kinds of changes that you'd like to see?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I think you have to work on more than one front.     You&#13;
&#13;
have to break up the system where you too seldom recruit&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 29&#13;
&#13;
people from the outside.     You have to try to bring in more&#13;
&#13;
"new" people.     You have to try to encourage people to do&#13;
&#13;
something else.     They don't have to live and die in this&#13;
&#13;
institution.    You have to try to increase the turnover in a&#13;
&#13;
way so you can bring in more fresh blood.     We need men and&#13;
&#13;
women with different experiences, with different backgrounds.&#13;
&#13;
I also think that you have to work inside the institution on&#13;
&#13;
different fronts and, for instance, try to encourage women to&#13;
&#13;
take on managerial positions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   There is a wonderful quote that we found from an&#13;
&#13;
interview with you in Bank World.     It dealt with the whole&#13;
&#13;
question of the private sector in meeting new&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities.     You said that "The Bank has to move away&#13;
&#13;
from an Anglo-American type of market economy, towards a&#13;
&#13;
capitalism that also builds on the experience of Europe and&#13;
&#13;
some Asian countries.     We are looking for a market economy&#13;
&#13;
with a human face."     In looking at questions of the&#13;
&#13;
development of human capital, how do you deal with developing&#13;
&#13;
human capital in a market environment?     If you can do that,&#13;
&#13;
how is it that other forms of market economies are different&#13;
&#13;
and/or better than the Anglo-American version?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I'm influenced very much by, again, the Nordic way of&#13;
&#13;
thinking.   We think that everyone should have the same&#13;
&#13;
access, for instance, to health care and good education, and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Maehlum, Page 30&#13;
&#13;
that the government has a role in providing that for&#13;
&#13;
everyone.   We are brought up with the fact that we have to&#13;
&#13;
pay high taxes; our salaries are reasonably low; and there is&#13;
&#13;
not much difference between those who are in top positions&#13;
&#13;
and those who are on the middle management level.&#13;
&#13;
     I think I am very much influenced by the Nordic view&#13;
&#13;
that to give individuals these basic rights for them to be&#13;
&#13;
productive workers and to fulfill their role in society.&#13;
&#13;
Investing in individuals is a gain for society.&#13;
&#13;
     Nordics very often feel that, for instance, introducing&#13;
&#13;
user fees might prevent a large portion of the population&#13;
&#13;
from gaining access to good schools and good health.    As a&#13;
&#13;
result, whenever these issues, for instance, of children&#13;
&#13;
having to pay for their uniforms, textbooks, or vaccinations&#13;
&#13;
come up, we always become very cautious because we are afraid&#13;
&#13;
that there are many who will not get these basic services.&#13;
&#13;
We think that there is a role for the state in providing some&#13;
&#13;
of these basic services.    The more libertarian ideological&#13;
&#13;
approaches which tell us that the market is going to take&#13;
&#13;
care of all of these basic services, are, in my view, too&#13;
&#13;
extreme.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, that being said, our model in the Nordic countries&#13;
&#13;
is not the perfect model.    However, I do think that the North&#13;
&#13;
American model is not the perfect model either.     If you&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 31&#13;
recruit only people from this continent, with this kind of&#13;
&#13;
background and education to the World Bank, I fear that the&#13;
&#13;
Anglo-American approach will translate into the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
thinking when they discuss how an educational project is to&#13;
&#13;
be designed in an African country, or how a social health&#13;
&#13;
project is going to be designed.     That is not a development&#13;
&#13;
which I would like to see.     That's why I feel that there is a&#13;
&#13;
need for more diversity in the way the staff is thinking.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You've worked under the administrations of both&#13;
&#13;
Presidents Conable and Preston, and I wonder if you'd assess&#13;
&#13;
some of their achievements.&#13;
&#13;
A:   As I said, Conable had very much the same agenda as the&#13;
&#13;
Nordics had, and he was able to put some of the issues on his&#13;
&#13;
agenda in the forefront.     He emphasized issues of gender and&#13;
&#13;
poverty.   He continued to put emphasis on the environment.&#13;
&#13;
     I haven't seen the same expression of strategic choices&#13;
&#13;
from Preston however.   Now we are getting it in the vision&#13;
&#13;
paper, but it took two years.     That is a little bit too long.&#13;
&#13;
Without talking about individuals, if I look ahead and think&#13;
&#13;
about what I would like to see in a future president,     I&#13;
&#13;
would like to see a person who is both a visionary and a good&#13;
&#13;
manager.   You have to have somebody who can lead the&#13;
&#13;
institution and stimulate people on the agenda, yet we also&#13;
&#13;
need somebody who can manage this large bureaucracy.      This&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Maehlum, Page 32&#13;
person is not easy to find, but that's what I would like to&#13;
&#13;
see.    I'm sure that person is hiding somewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Do you think Mr. Preston is a good manager?&#13;
&#13;
A:     He is clearly interested in organizational issues and&#13;
&#13;
wants to give attention to those issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Do you see any evidence that things have improved&#13;
&#13;
because there is somebody in charge who thinks he is a good&#13;
&#13;
manager?&#13;
&#13;
A:     It is difficult to say.   But, I think he has delegated&#13;
&#13;
too much.    I'm for delegation, but I think that he has gone&#13;
&#13;
too far.    It's difficult to find anyone who's really&#13;
&#13;
responsible and accountable for specific issues anymore.         The&#13;
&#13;
task managers have been given so much room to maneuver that&#13;
&#13;
there seems to be a lack of accountability with key people,&#13;
&#13;
and that, in my view, is not a good thing.&#13;
&#13;
       It's also difficult to see how policies are translated&#13;
&#13;
into project designs across the board.      There is a lack of&#13;
&#13;
consistency when it comes to policy implementation in the&#13;
&#13;
various regions.    For instance, one Vice President can have a&#13;
&#13;
totally different approach to conditionality than another&#13;
&#13;
Vice President.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Can I just ask one other question?    You mentioned&#13;
&#13;
briefly the Nordic support that has been given to preparing&#13;
&#13;
the gender paper, and of course, the Nordic countries and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 33&#13;
Norway have given strong support to the Bank through some of&#13;
these trust funds arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The Bank has come to depend very heavily on this outside&#13;
&#13;
support.    In some units, up to 40 percent of their budget is&#13;
&#13;
funded through external arrangements.    Do you think that this&#13;
&#13;
is a good thing for the Bank?     Is this something that you&#13;
&#13;
feel has contributed to the tendency to break through the&#13;
&#13;
bureaucratic bottlenecks here in the Bank, or do you think&#13;
&#13;
that this is something that has tended to dilute&#13;
&#13;
accountability and focus?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, from a Nordic perspective, it has been helpful in&#13;
&#13;
the sense that our bilateral contribution has ''assisted" the&#13;
&#13;
Bank to move in the direction that we wanted.     However, at&#13;
&#13;
the same time, I recognize that there are too many trust&#13;
&#13;
funds with too many donor constraints, and that the&#13;
&#13;
administrative burden for the Bank is too heavy.     I do not&#13;
&#13;
think the solution is to eliminate all the trust funds.        I&#13;
&#13;
think that there has to be some kind of a consolidation where&#13;
&#13;
the criteria for trust funds are more clearly defined.     As&#13;
&#13;
long as those trust funds are geared towards the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
agenda, with a relatively small amount of funding,    I think&#13;
&#13;
that's fine.&#13;
&#13;
     The question becomes more serious if a large donor with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Maehlum, Page 34&#13;
&#13;
a huge amount of money wanted to put the money in a trust&#13;
&#13;
fund which was focused on something which might not be in&#13;
&#13;
line with the Bank's agenda.    I haven't seen that yet.&#13;
&#13;
     For instance, if the Japanese should decide that all the&#13;
&#13;
money they put into the Bank should go to migration or&#13;
&#13;
another field, that might change the Bank's agenda and,&#13;
&#13;
clearly, that is not a development that I would like to see.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank is a multilateral institution and we should all&#13;
&#13;
decide what the agenda of the Bank should be.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Thank you, Mrs. Maehlum.   This has all been very&#13;
&#13;
interesting.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Thank you very much.&#13;

            In June 1994, Jorunn Maehlum was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by William Becker and Jochen Kraske. During
            her tenure at the Bank from 1989 to 1994, Mrs. Maehlum
            worked in the following areas: as an alternate executive
            director to Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden
            (1989-1992); and as an executive director to Denmark,
            Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, and
            Lithuania (1992-1994). Her tenure focused on economic
            development projects in Africa, Tanzania, and Norway.
