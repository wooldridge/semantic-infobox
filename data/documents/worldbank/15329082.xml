CHAIRMAN:            Will the meeting come to order?       First, I want to introduce and welcome&#13;
 (McCloy)&#13;
                     N~.   McFarlane, vmo sits at the end of the table on my right, as the new&#13;
&#13;
                     Executive Director for Australia, Syria and Lebanon.          Is your Alternate&#13;
&#13;
                     here, 1I,r. McFarlane?&#13;
&#13;
McF AItLANE :        No.    He is acting   do\~   at your sister organization, the FUnd, and I thought&#13;
&#13;
                     he had better carry on there.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:            I am also glad to welcome the returning prodigals, Mr. biachado and Sir&#13;
&#13;
                     Gordo n Munro.&#13;
&#13;
                     You have all seen the minutes of the last meeting.           If there are no&#13;
&#13;
                     comments, I will declare them approved.        I have nothing else on the formal&#13;
&#13;
                     agenda.    There are a number of minor points that I think we might take&#13;
&#13;
                     now.    I believe the Board is aware of the fact that Virginia has passed&#13;
&#13;
                     legislation legit:i..mizing our bonds.     Mr. Dunstan is about to go to st. Louis&#13;
&#13;
                     to endeavor to get Ydssouri legislation passed.           Missouri is not as important&#13;
&#13;
                     a state to us as some of the others, but the more the better.           Missouri is&#13;
&#13;
                     one of those states where there has been a good bit of lethargy, if not&#13;
&#13;
                     opposi ti on.    Vie have however, been able to enlist the assistance of the&#13;
&#13;
                     secretary of the Treasury, and I think that with the appeal which Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                     Dunstan    ~~ll   make, there should at least be a good case for adoption of&#13;
&#13;
                     legislation there.       Is there anything further you want to say about that,&#13;
&#13;
                     Hr. Dunstan?&#13;
&#13;
DUNSTftJJ:           Mr. McCloy, I can just add that we have had quite a lot of success around:&#13;
&#13;
                     the country in broadening the scope of the Bank I s securities generally 'I'd th&#13;
&#13;
                     investors for bonds and particularly with saving banks, trust companies, etc.&#13;
&amp;#12;DUNSTAN:    In some cases, the banking commissioner of a state would have the power&#13;
(C   'd)&#13;
            to rule, and they therefore did not require    le~islation.       The banking&#13;
&#13;
            commissioner or governor could rule whether our bonds were eligible.&#13;
&#13;
            As we have gone along and become better known, there have been favorable&#13;
&#13;
            rulings in a number of states.    The eligible states for various institu-&#13;
&#13;
            tions has increased a good percentage over July when the issue came out.&#13;
&#13;
            We have had one of the men from my office go dovm south.          He has been&#13;
&#13;
            there two weeks, working with people in Mississippi, Kentucky, Louisiana&#13;
&#13;
            and Tennessee.    Tennessee is one of those cases   ~nere   the   co~ssioner&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            can rule, but we have not been successful yet in getting the ruling.&#13;
&#13;
            Other states have legislative sessions now, and we have arranged for&#13;
&#13;
            legislation in the states Yvhere the legislature is in session.         We have&#13;
            been successful, as you know, in Massachusetts and Virginia, and legis-&#13;
&#13;
             lation is now pending in 11hode Island, llissouri, Kentucky and Louisiana.&#13;
            That is all I have on that subject.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   Do you think you could tell us something about the market?&#13;
&#13;
DuNSTAN:    The market for our bonds has been doing quite a bit better.          Generally&#13;
&#13;
            speaking, as to the general bond market, there has been a let-up in the&#13;
            selling of U.S.   GoverP~nt   bonds.   There has not been the pressure on the&#13;
            part of institutions and investors to sell U.s. Oovernment Bonds.          The&#13;
&#13;
            Federal Reserve Bank has not had to take so many recently, and there has&#13;
&#13;
            been some improvement in the price level for high grade corporate securities,&#13;
&#13;
            that is, Triple-A Corporate Securities.      Those two things seem to reflect&#13;
&#13;
            an opinion that gives more confidence in the high grade bond market.             On&#13;
&#13;
            the other hand, institutions have not been too avid to buy new issues.&#13;
&#13;
            There have been this week two hieh grade bond issues offered by the under-&#13;
&#13;
            writers; one was the Public Service Company of Oklahoma, $10,000,000; the&#13;
&#13;
            other was the San Diego Gas and Electric; both thirty years, both first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 744 -&#13;
&amp;#12;DU~      \1~:    mortgage.    They were offered at 2.97~% and 2.93% respectively.             They were&#13;
(Can" I d)&#13;
                 failures and were not taken up.              The underwriters' bid for those bonds&#13;
&#13;
                 in competition, made a very close cover in both cases.              Owing to the fact&#13;
&#13;
                 that the institutional investors did not buy, they are to suffer a loss&#13;
&#13;
                 now.   With the improvement in price level for the Triple-A Bonds, the top&#13;
&#13;
                 category, and the lack of selling of Government Bonds, our bonds have done&#13;
&#13;
                 better.     As a result of that, coupled vdth other things like going around&#13;
&#13;
                 visiting these institutions and getting them to increase their holdings,&#13;
&#13;
                 our bonds have done much better.              I have not checked the office this morn-&#13;
&#13;
                 ing, but tile last sale of our 3 s yesterday was a block of 100 bonds at&#13;
                                                          '&#13;
                 97 7/8.     That is a new   hiâ&#130;¬?J.   in this move, to which they have come up from&#13;
&#13;
                 94~.   The bid is much better than the offered side; in other words, the&#13;
&#13;
                 bid is stronger than the offered side, while several weeks ago it was theÂ·&#13;
&#13;
                 other way around.     There was a time yihen it was hard to get a bid for any&#13;
&#13;
                 bonds. Now you can get a bid for half a million bonds.              So it is better,&#13;
&#13;
                 but we are keeping up the work of visiting institutions.              That is about&#13;
&#13;
                 the story.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIffiJAN:      I think it may be of interest to talk about the results of the New York&#13;
&#13;
                 state issue and a comparison of yields.&#13;
&#13;
MUNRO:           Might I ask one question on what Mr. Dunstan has just said.               You said the&#13;
&#13;
                 price had moved up from       94i to 96 7/8.        'I~bat I want to ask is why they&#13;
&#13;
                 are up.     Is it because there has been considerable routine investment&#13;
&#13;
                 interest in the bonds which the market adjustments have now cleared or is&#13;
&#13;
                 there substantial new investment looking for Bank bonds as the result of&#13;
&#13;
                 wider eligibility.     Do you know?&#13;
&#13;
1)1"   ~'t'AN:   VIe 11 , I know pretty well.         There were two large blocks of bonds in dealers I&#13;
&#13;
                 hands.    Those bonds have been placed.            That in itself has encouraged the&#13;
&#13;
                 dealers to go out and do a little work themselves to try to sell other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      - 745 -&#13;
&amp;#12;           people..   I think both things have contributed.       It has been a psychological&#13;
&#13;
           improvement.      Even more important has been the placement of the bonds in&#13;
&#13;
           dealers' hands.      I would guess, and it is a pure guess because dealers are&#13;
&#13;
           making markets all the time (sometimes they are short, oometimes they are&#13;
&#13;
           long), as a pre guess I would say that bonds in the hands or dealers today&#13;
&#13;
           amount to about $3,SOO,000 or not over $4,000,000.         That compares to several&#13;
&#13;
           weeks ago. when there were $15 to $16 million in their hands.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:     A lot of those are not for sale..     I think they may have them, but not many&#13;
&#13;
           are for sale ..&#13;
&#13;
fu11NRO:   Are we going to have substantial investments and bids from Massachusetts&#13;
&#13;
           and Virginia, following their general      i~estment    enquiries at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
DUSTAN:    Insurance companies in Virginia are very small, and in Massachusetts quite&#13;
&#13;
           substantial.      The legislation in Massachusetts does not become effective&#13;
&#13;
           until 90 days have expired after the Governor has signed.         The Governor&#13;
&#13;
           signed the bill a little over three yreeks ago, so there is a little over&#13;
&#13;
           two months more before it is legal for insurance companies to invest in&#13;
&#13;
           the Bank's bonds.      In the meantime, we are bringing four or five men down&#13;
&#13;
           here, who are the financial and bond men of the insurance companies.          lfe&#13;
&#13;
           are bringing them down here and putting them through the school, beginning&#13;
&#13;
           at 9 :30 in the morning.     They will meet the heads of Departments and some&#13;
&#13;
           of you Executive Directors.      That is one of the most impressive things we&#13;
&#13;
           do.    Whenever we have had a few men down here, they seem to have been very&#13;
&#13;
           favorably impressed.      They go away ,wanting to do something..    They may not&#13;
&#13;
           be able to get their Boards to do something, but they definitely want to&#13;
&#13;
           do something themselves..     These 4 or   S men   are coming here on March 24th,&#13;
&#13;
           I believe, and they should buy some bonds, though they have not promised&#13;
&#13;
           that they )'muld.     I know that one company, one of the smallest has bought&#13;
&#13;
           50    bonds for $50,000, even though they are not legal yet.        They have bought&#13;
&#13;
           them for delayed delivery.&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAIW..AN:    l'lhat about the NeY{ York State issue?&#13;
&#13;
DUh,. d.AN:   The New York State deal was a very interesting deal.         It was one of the&#13;
&#13;
              largest issues of bonds in history.       There were $300,000,000 Serial Bonds&#13;
&#13;
              maturing in one to ten years, that is, $30,000,000 each year, which is a&#13;
&#13;
              sizeable issue in itself.     Those bonds, as you know, are tax-free.       The&#13;
&#13;
              income is tax-free in the hands of holders.       They are free from Federal&#13;
&#13;
              taxation and free from New York State taxation if one is a resident of&#13;
&#13;
              New York State.    The security is quadruple A, if there is such a thing.&#13;
&#13;
              Because of the volume, however, they got only one bid, and every dealer&#13;
&#13;
              in the country of any substance and every bank that deals in municipal&#13;
&#13;
              bonds of any substance were in the business.       There were over 200 people,&#13;
&#13;
              and the bonds were offered at    ve~    attractive yields; the first maturity&#13;
&#13;
              in one year, was offered at slightJ.,y less than 1%, 90/100ths; the last in&#13;
&#13;
              ten years was offered at 1.85%.        Now you know that corporations pay Federal&#13;
&#13;
              Income Tax of 38% if income is paid in the U.S.        If you take 38% off 3%&#13;
              Bonds at par, you get a yield,of about 1.85%.       So the   ten-J~ar   maturity of&#13;
&#13;
              l~ew   York was offered at 1.85%, equivalent to a   ten-)~ar   obligation of a&#13;
&#13;
              taxable bond being offered at 3% to corporations, banks for instance.             They&#13;
&#13;
              were very attractive.     They sold very well, am as a matter of fact, they&#13;
&#13;
              have been marketed.     Most of the maturities are up about a point over the&#13;
&#13;
              issue price.     There will be one more issue somewhat similar to that by the&#13;
&#13;
              state of Ohio.     The New York b'tate issue was to pay a bonus to World War II&#13;
&#13;
              Veterans.     The state of Ohio will issue $200,000,000 of bonds very soon for&#13;
&#13;
              the same purpose.     That will probably be a one bid proposition, am the&#13;
&#13;
              bonds will probably be very attractive in price.        That has a bearing on our&#13;
&#13;
              ovm obligations to some extent, when a cormnercial bank can buy 10-Year&#13;
&#13;
              State of lJew York Bonds to   ~rield   3% taxable, when our bonds are selling at&#13;
              a 2.65% ,,rield.   So it has a bearing on the Bank's bonds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;            I think tilat is a very interesting comparison.     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr.    Black, I vionder whether we shouJ.d not report what we did yesterday&#13;
&#13;
            about the application to the N.A.C.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:      You mean the proposed legislation1&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:      We wrote a letter to Mr. Snyder, who is Chairman of the N.A.C. suggesting,&#13;
&#13;
            or rather requesting, certain legislation.      The first piece of legislation&#13;
&#13;
            we want is an amendment to the Banking Act which would allow banks in this&#13;
&#13;
            country to have bond departments deal actively in our securities.       Banks&#13;
&#13;
            under the Banking Act which was passed in 1933 can only deal in am under-&#13;
&#13;
            write U.S. Government Bonds, municipal bonds such as the New York State&#13;
&#13;
            bonds Mr. Dunstan just spoke about, and Federal Home Loan am other Federal&#13;
&#13;
            agency bonds on Government application.      They cannot legally buy public&#13;
&#13;
            securities, such as railroad, utility, industrial or foreign bonds.        OUr&#13;
&#13;
            bonds in the first instance should be classified under what we call exempt&#13;
&#13;
            security, which means the banks can deal in them as in Government sec uri ties,&#13;
&#13;
            so we have asked for that legislation.      How long it \7ill take to come through,&#13;
&#13;
            or whether we can get it through, we do not know.      It mie;ht be quite a long&#13;
&#13;
            drawn-out process.     It would be a valuable thing to have.   It would broaden&#13;
&#13;
            our market, and also improve the size of our market if the banks in the&#13;
&#13;
            country could deal in our securities.      The second piece of legislation we&#13;
&#13;
            asked for was an    ~~endment   to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 or&#13;
&#13;
            193h in which our bonds in the future would be exempted from registration&#13;
            under the S.E.C.     We have discussed this matter with S.E.C. commissioners,&#13;
&#13;
            1'mo feel that we have a good. case, and that our bonds should be exempt.&#13;
&#13;
            So we asked for that.      The otiler piece of legislation we asked for was the&#13;
&#13;
            legalizing of our bonds for insurance companies in the District of Columbia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             , 748 -&#13;
&amp;#12; BLACK:     All these are useful proposals but we are not confident we can get them,&#13;
(COt 'i)&#13;
            and I have no idea how long it will take.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   :Mr. Machado, I wonder whether you can tell us a little of what went on&#13;
&#13;
            at Havana.&#13;
&#13;
MACHADO:    As you probably know, Havana has been a very busy city in the last three&#13;
&#13;
            months.    We have been holding what is known as the loT.D. Conference, with&#13;
            the idea of establishing a separate, specialized agency of the U.N. for&#13;
&#13;
            the purpose of increasing world trade by means of lower tariÂ£fs, if not&#13;
&#13;
            entirely without tariffs; and at least providing conditions whereby tariffs&#13;
&#13;
            Vlrill be brought dovm in the course of the next few years.    This is not the&#13;
&#13;
            first time there has been a meeting of an organization like this.       It&#13;
&#13;
            started two years ago in New York, by holding a preparatory meeting of&#13;
            countries representing world trade.      Negotiations continued in London,&#13;
&#13;
            and as a result of the London and New York meetings, a further meeting was&#13;
&#13;
            held in Geneva, at which the number of countries was increased, and at&#13;
            least 85% of total world trade was represented.      At Geneva, a tentative&#13;
&#13;
            draft of a trade charter was drawn up, but still those countries not&#13;
&#13;
            participating were necessary to make the organization a going concern.&#13;
            A meeting vms therefore called in Havana to consider the text of the&#13;
&#13;
            charter drafted at Geneva.       You will remember that on November 15th I&#13;
            went there,    ~~d   we thought the meeting would be finished at the beginning&#13;
            of   Janua~.   We have since found out that things do not go as fast as&#13;
&#13;
            planned.     First it was extended to the middle of January, then to the end&#13;
&#13;
            of Ja.l1uary, then to the middle of February, then to the end of February,&#13;
&#13;
            and now we hope to finish the conference on March 25th.       A great deal&#13;
&#13;
            however, has been accomplished.       There has been a complete revision of&#13;
&#13;
            the Geneva draft, and as a result of trade discussions, negotiations,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MAO.l' tlDO:     and compromise, we have agreed on a charter that will actually mean a great&#13;
 (\      t,"d)&#13;
                 improvement in trade relations allover the world.          This is very important&#13;
&#13;
                 from the Bank's point of view.        In the first place, the charter as it now&#13;
&#13;
                 stands is fLTJ.al and approved.      It is in the hands of the drafting committee&#13;
&#13;
                 ani it provides for safeguarding the interest of the Baal{ from the investors'&#13;
&#13;
                 point of view; and for the facilities as far as we can at this stage foresee&#13;
&#13;
                 them that should be given to investors of capital in underdeveloped countries.&#13;
&#13;
                 The most important features in my opinion are that the I.T.O. will be set&#13;
&#13;
                 going, we figure, in a year 1 s time, and will require three years to get&#13;
&#13;
                 going.-   Still it actually completes the work in the field of U.N. activity&#13;
&#13;
                 because now we have F.A.O. taking care of the problem of food and disposing&#13;
&#13;
                 of possible surpluses in the world; we have the Fund stabilizing the currencieE&#13;
&#13;
                 of the world, and the Bank for Reconstruction and Development.         We will now&#13;
&#13;
                 have yrhat is to provide for the expansion of world trade, to make inter-&#13;
&#13;
                 national agreements for the reduction of tariffs and regulation of quanti-&#13;
&#13;
                 tative restrictions, without which plans of the Fund would have had to be&#13;
&#13;
                 scrapped, and without which, no matter how sincere we are in our purpose,&#13;
&#13;
                 no loans of a sound nature can be made.        P~other   question about the Havana&#13;
&#13;
                 Charter is that it is a very important piece of international legislation&#13;
&#13;
                 in the economic field.    I had planned to be able simply to look after the&#13;
&#13;
                 Bank's interest, but I found myself appointed delegate for the Cuban Govern-&#13;
                 ment, and that I could be more useful to the Bank by helping at the I.T.O.&#13;
&#13;
                 conference than just come to Washington, where I was being represented by&#13;
&#13;
                 a very able substitute.      The hopes of the world are now pinned to this&#13;
&#13;
                 Havana Charter.    In this general agreement signed by 16 countries at Geneva,&#13;
&#13;
                 one-half have ratified the agreement substantially reducing all tariffs,&#13;
&#13;
                 tariffs dealing with   3/4   of entire world trade.      It is a very important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 71)0 -&#13;
&amp;#12;            event, because the door is now open to all countries Who did not participate&#13;
            at Geneva, but did in Havana, to become parties to the general agreement.&#13;
&#13;
            In the next two years, the benefits of this general agreement on tariff&#13;
&#13;
            reduction will be granted gratis, to all countries of the world -who did&#13;
&#13;
            not become members of the I.T.O. but -who then do so, in the hope that&#13;
&#13;
            countries will negotiate further tariff reduction.    If this happens as&#13;
&#13;
            planned, a way is clear to Bee a definite improvement in world trade in&#13;
&#13;
            the next few years, and certainly a more optimistic view of the economic&#13;
&#13;
            position of the world within the next three years than i f there had been&#13;
&#13;
            no charter.   I do not want to bother you with all the details - they have&#13;
&#13;
            become headaches to me -and you have probably been following them in the&#13;
&#13;
            press, and in the various reports on the battle of Havana.     On the whole,&#13;
&#13;
            I think the economic situation of the world will be far better once the&#13;
&#13;
            Havana Charter goes into operation.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   You think it is a great improvement over the Geneva draft?&#13;
&#13;
MACHAOO:    Definitely.   First of all, it provides for what we call the development of&#13;
&#13;
            under-developed countries more than the Geneva draft contemplated.        In&#13;
&#13;
            other words, the sharp distinction which existed in the Geneva draft&#13;
&#13;
            between the already developed country and the under-developedcountry has&#13;
            been greatly smoothed out.   Quantitative restrictions which were one of&#13;
&#13;
            the most ticklish points of the conditions were finally adjusted in com-&#13;
&#13;
            promise.   That I think is a wonderful piece of diplomacy and good inter-&#13;
&#13;
            national cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:   PJW questions?   Sir Gordon, do you want to tell us what you gleaned on&#13;
&#13;
            your side of the world?   Any impreSSions of the Europea.'rl situation?&#13;
&#13;
MUNRD:      I do not know that there is very much I can tell you of interest.         I would&#13;
&#13;
            like to say that I had a long talk with Sir Stafford Cripps, the U.K.&#13;
&#13;
            Governor, on the subject of the Bank.     He particularly wanted me to bring&#13;
&#13;
            him as far as I could into the picture.    He did ask me to say, I am glad&#13;
&#13;
                                          ..,r'.,&#13;
&amp;#12;to have the opportunity to say to you, and through you to the Directors,&#13;
&#13;
haw very pleased he was to be able to assume the U.K. Governorship in&#13;
&#13;
place of his predecessor, as Chancellor.     It is quite clear, from the way&#13;
&#13;
he spoke, that he, insofar as it is possible for me to say is prepared to&#13;
&#13;
take a lively personal interest in the Bank.     He was particularly pleased&#13;
&#13;
and it suited him particularly as well as some of the other governors, that&#13;
&#13;
the arrangements to hold the annual meeting, here a few days before the end&#13;
&#13;
of September, were able to be carried out.     It enables him to come, because,&#13;
&#13;
short of the unforeseen, he is certainly going to be here for that.         Further,&#13;
&#13;
of direct interest to the Bank, I had a chance to talk with Sir Arthur&#13;
&#13;
Sal ter on various matters to do with the Advisory    Council~   At that time&#13;
&#13;
I think he had written an answer to a letter which he had received from&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Sundaresan on the subject of the Tenth Member.      For the rest we dis-&#13;
&#13;
cussed what might happen ..men he came out in July.     There are some more&#13;
&#13;
personal aspects which I would report to you personnaly, an::! not bore the&#13;
&#13;
\vhole meeting.   He is quite obviously and quite properly taking the job&#13;
&#13;
of Chairman of the Advisory Council very seriously, and is anxious to get&#13;
&#13;
off on the right foot and see what we expect of him.      He does feel that it&#13;
is desirable, in the first instance, that approaches shall be informal&#13;
&#13;
rather than otherwise until we can see which way it is going.       He is&#13;
&#13;
particularly anxious that the report which they make shall receive very&#13;
&#13;
careful consideration by everybody, to make it appear, as will be the case,&#13;
&#13;
that the Advisory Council is there to function so far as he is concerned.&#13;
&#13;
That I think is all I need to say directly concerning the Bank.       I have not&#13;
&#13;
a great deal more to say.    You will have noted one or more speeches and&#13;
&#13;
press conferences of Sir Stafford Cripps on the developments in the U.K.&#13;
&#13;
and Europe and the principal idea at the moment, namely the Western Union&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 752 -&#13;
&amp;#12;MUNRO:              idea.    You know what is going on in terms of steps we are taking at home&#13;
(C&lt;   'd)&#13;
                    to   bridge the gap until, as we hope and believe, E.H.P. will be on its&#13;
&#13;
                    way to all nations concerned who are beneficiaries.        A very i.mportant&#13;
&#13;
                    aspect of that is the time factor, but I think everfbody is fully alive&#13;
&#13;
                    and conscious of that at this end.     I do   no~   know of anything else I can&#13;
&#13;
                    say, unless there is any question anybody wants to ask.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:           Are there any questions arryone wants to ask?        I hope we will get from the&#13;
&#13;
                    Directors suggestions as to the agenda of the Advisory Council as soon as&#13;
&#13;
                    possible; because it issamething new we want to think about this function&#13;
&#13;
                    and the type of discussions that could be most beneficial.        The staff is&#13;
&#13;
                    giving some thought to it, but we would be very anxious to have the thoughts&#13;
&#13;
                    of the Directors.&#13;
&#13;
                    As ,for the European Recovery Program, I think you all know that Mr. Douglas&#13;
&#13;
                    has returned with the idea of picking up contacts in Congress and with the&#13;
&#13;
                    idea of trJing to speed things up as much as possible.         I do not believe&#13;
&#13;
                    I have any information about it that has not already appeared in the paper.&#13;
&#13;
                    From what I can gather from those I have talked with, there is a growing&#13;
&#13;
                    consciousness of the need for prompt    act~n.       There will be considerable&#13;
&#13;
                    debate yet before the vote is taken, but perhaps the only thing I am rather&#13;
&#13;
                    optimistic about rather than pessimistic       is the timing   cons~derine   the date&#13;
&#13;
                    they originally set for themselves.     I am quite aware of the fact however,&#13;
&#13;
                    L~at    developments may occur in the world which .rill make the timing appear&#13;
&#13;
                    slow.     Mr. Crena de Iongh, I think you might report on the arrangements&#13;
&#13;
                    you have made vdth the French    C~vernment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CR.:ENA DE IONGH:   I th ink the Board knows tP.at we try to use the local currencies as much&#13;
&#13;
                    as we can for paying expenses in various countries.         Of course these are&#13;
&#13;
                    not very much, but in sCllle cases they are., and there we must be careful&#13;
&#13;
                    when we get to a situation where the official rate does not represent in&#13;
&#13;
                    our opinion the real buying power.     This v.ould make our expenses paid at&#13;
&amp;#12;CW--' .DE IONGH:   the official rate very high.     ThiE case we thought existed in France.             So&#13;
&#13;
                   we approached the French authorities, who were extremely understanding&#13;
&#13;
                   and helpful, ani we worked out a system which I think might be used in&#13;
&#13;
                   other cases too.    The French promise to sell us dollars at         ~e   official&#13;
&#13;
                   rate of 214, and then sell these dollars for us at the free market rate,&#13;
&#13;
                   which at the present time is about 310.         The French authorities approached&#13;
&#13;
                   ViI'. Hoppenot for his advice.   VT. Hoppenot studied it and thought it was&#13;
&#13;
                   a good system.     So this has been settled with the French authorities.             I&#13;
&#13;
                   just want to stress the fact that all this was done in a very great spirit&#13;
&#13;
                   of cooperation and helpfulness.      We thought that the     firs~   example was&#13;
&#13;
                   important because it might set a custom.         As we have some expenses to make&#13;
&#13;
                   in China, where a man from the Loan Department is traveling, I approached&#13;
&#13;
                   LT. Yu on this point, and he advised that we should cable to our man in&#13;
                   China to see Mr. Shen about it.      This morning I got a cable from Mr. de&#13;
&#13;
                   Sercey, telling me he is going to approach Mr. Shen.          ''-ie have not any&#13;
&#13;
                   defini te answer yet, but I think this will also lead to a satisfactory&#13;
&#13;
                   result.   The case in China is ver-J important, because the of.ficial rate is&#13;
&#13;
                   12,000 Chinese dollars to the American dollar, while the official free&#13;
&#13;
                   market rate is 150,000, more than ten times as much.          Of course there we&#13;
&#13;
                   run into another difficulty, a third unofficial market.          If my information&#13;
&#13;
                   is right the rate there is 250,000.          I am quite sure the Chinese ~-overnment&#13;
&#13;
                   will be just as cooperati ve.    I think it is important to have the opportu-&#13;
&#13;
                   nity to talk about this because this situation might arise in other&#13;
&#13;
                   countries.&#13;
&#13;
Cl:{AIRh';..t\N:   I thank the French Executive Director, Mr. Hoppenot, for his cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
                   The French PJTl.bassador to the United States phoned me about it ani I thanked&#13;
&#13;
                   him for his cooperA.tion.    I think that completes all I had in mind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;BEYEN:        I have a question to ask.     There is a rumor that the Swiss in their dire&#13;
                                                                                 â&#128;¢&#13;
              need have taken up the original idea that funds might be used for invest-&#13;
              ment in our bonds.    I do not know whether we know about it.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRN..AN:   The Swiss Delegation called upon me, not the       ~Yiss   Delegation as such, but&#13;
&#13;
              one or two of its members, the other day after first making some very&#13;
&#13;
              cautious inquiries as to vmether I would receive them.          I indicated that I&#13;
&#13;
              would be glad to see anyone who came in.&#13;
&#13;
BAHANSKI:     They went by the back door.&#13;
&#13;
CH.UIDfiAN:   The back door first, tilen the front door; they wanted to be sure they&#13;
&#13;
              would not be thrown dovm the elevator shaft.        They said they were endeavor-&#13;
&#13;
              ing to work out something satisfacoty.         They had heard of the informal&#13;
&#13;
              paper that we had given to Mr. Snyder a long tLTJ1e ago.        Its contents are&#13;
&#13;
              known to the Board.    In substance I told them that we had put forHard that&#13;
&#13;
              suggestion merely in response to an inquiry which had been made of me and&#13;
&#13;
              the staff as to Whether we had any idea how this thing might be solved;&#13;
&#13;
              that I did not feel that it was appropriate for the Bank to do anything&#13;
&#13;
              more in that connection; that we always stood ready and willing to consider&#13;
&#13;
              any suggestions that might come forward.involving the usefulness of the&#13;
&#13;
              Bank, but that we did not feel we could; and in fact they did not ask us&#13;
              to take any furtiler action.       They are strugEling with this problem and&#13;
&#13;
              continuing their discussions with vari ous representati ves of the United&#13;
&#13;
              states   C~ernment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              You do not know how far they have pursued the ideal&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     I know they have the idea, but we rather refrained from going any further.&#13;
&#13;
              They did not press us to, but they asked for further suggestions.          We&#13;
&#13;
              said we had better not offer any under the circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
              Which is quite understandable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             -    7C;C:; -&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAIRN:AN:   It is understandable.   We did not rebuff them in any sense, but pointed&#13;
             out that our position did not enable us to make any further overtures.&#13;
             ~   had not made any to date, except in response to the N.A.C., but if and&#13;
             when anything came forward we would consider it and do all we could to&#13;
&#13;
             make the Bank useful in connection with any possible solution, but we did&#13;
&#13;
             not want to do anything more than that.       They did not ask us to do anything&#13;
&#13;
             more than that.   They merely said that they were using the name of the&#13;
&#13;
             World Bank and had wanted to drop in and speak to us only for that reason.&#13;
             Anybody have anything else?&#13;
&#13;
BASYN:       Is there anything special to report on loans?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    Mr. Iliff is ill, ani is not here this morning.         I do not believe there&#13;
&#13;
             have been any developments since last week's report that are worth report-&#13;
&#13;
             ing today.   Towards the end of the week we will have in circulation to the&#13;
&#13;
             Executive Directors a memorandum prepared by      1~.   Varvaressos on the general&#13;
&#13;
             European recovery pro gram.   I have read that memorandum.       I t.hink it is an&#13;
&#13;
             extremely penetrating discussion of the subject, and I am sure you will&#13;
&#13;
             all be interested in reading it, as I was.        Does the staff have anything?&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:    Only one question to Mr. Dunstan.        There was a considerable fall last week&#13;
&#13;
             in the Norwegian and Danish Bonds, and I compare them for instance with&#13;
&#13;
             the Bonds of Belgian and Dutch Governments, which did not suffer.         ;'\hat&#13;
&#13;
             is the explanation?&#13;
&#13;
DUNSTAN:     I do not know that I have the explanation of that.         It may have something&#13;
&#13;
             to do with where war is going to strike.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:    I know, but Why have not the Dutch Bonds suffered and the Danish have?&#13;
&#13;
DUNSTAN:     It is probably a question of F'inland and Scandinavia.&#13;
&#13;
M.ACHADO:    Geography.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 7'56 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                        (&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BL"~         I think it is partly geography and partly the type of holdings of securities.&#13;
&#13;
             The Dutch and Belgian issues are probably held in better hands.       These&#13;
&#13;
             sales of Norwegian and Danish Bonds were small, scattered sales, the size&#13;
&#13;
             of the market was quite limited, while the other bonds are in big blocks.&#13;
&#13;
             That is particulilrly true of Dutch Bonds.     They are .Just not for sale.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:    Is it something to do with the gold holdings of those countries here, from&#13;
&#13;
             the point of view of possible security?&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:       I doubt it.&#13;
&#13;
BASYN:       There are very few bonds outstanding in the Belgian issues.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    I noticed that the Italian Bonds took a dive this morning.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:    They were very low indeed.&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANI:   There are many reasons besides the political ones, such as the increase in&#13;
&#13;
             the fear of a new depreciation of the lira.      The exchange rate for dollars&#13;
&#13;
             has risen conSiderably over the last few days.      Yesterday I was told that&#13;
&#13;
             the day before last the dollar exchange rate had reached 700 lira.       It was&#13;
&#13;
             570 on the free market when I left Italy about six weeks ago.        There is&#13;
&#13;
             also the internal political crisis, and the fear of the elections in the&#13;
&#13;
             news coming from Italy, from letters of friends, and from friends coming&#13;
&#13;
             here.   There is naturally an unsettled condition which is perhaps a&#13;
&#13;
             consequence of the unsettlement in the United states.       If in the United&#13;
&#13;
             states there is such a fear of the probable outcome of the Italian elect-&#13;
&#13;
             ions, they will say in Italy that the fear exists and the situation is&#13;
&#13;
             serious.       The situation was not so serious when I left Italy.   On the&#13;
&#13;
             contrary, the day before, it was about the middle of January, I spoke with&#13;
&#13;
             the Minister of the Treasury, who had spoken with the Minister of Interior.&#13;
&#13;
             Both directly and in the Council of Ministers the latter had assured him&#13;
&#13;
             that -vihatever might happen he will be able to control the situation.        Now&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 757 -&#13;
&amp;#12;BRESCIANI:        I do not know..mat has happened afterwards.   I believe that there is much&#13;
(c,   'd)&#13;
                  exaggeration, because the Communists cannot have the arms and the weapons,&#13;
                  which the Regular Troops, the Carabinieri and the Police Force have.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:         But they have votes.&#13;
&#13;
                  Does anyone have anything else?   If not, we stand adjourned.&#13;
