Letter to the Council of Governors&#13;
June 30, 1992&#13;
The Board of Directors of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency is pleased&#13;
to report that MIGA's insurance, investment promotion, and advisory services grew&#13;
faster than planned during fiscal 1992.&#13;
MIGA 'sprograms are designed to encourage theflow ofprivateforeign direct investment&#13;
for productive purposes among its member countries, especially to developing member&#13;
countries. MIGA facilitates capital flows to developing countries by providing insurance&#13;
for private investors against political risks, by promoting investment activity, and by&#13;
assisting countries to create an attractive investment climate. MIGA thus complements&#13;
the development activities of the other members of the World Bank Group.&#13;
Lewis T. Preston, President of the Agency and Chairman of the Board of Directors,&#13;
submits this report and the accompanying auditedfinancial statementsfor thefiscal year&#13;
ending June 30,1992 on behalf of the Board to the Council of Governors in accordance&#13;
with the bvlaws of the Agency.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Cooperation with other investment insurers&#13;
MIGA is enjoined to cooperate with and seek to complement the activities of other&#13;
investment insurers. To this end, MIGA has the authority to enter into reinsurance and&#13;
coinsurance agreements with both private and public investment insurers, activities in&#13;
which it has enjoyed considerable success.&#13;
MIGA completed its first reinsurance arrangements with two national insurers (in&#13;
Canada and the United States) in fiscal 1990. The following year MIGA expanded its&#13;
coinsurance activities, participating in projects with insurers from Denmark, Japan, the&#13;
United Kingdom, and the United States. In fiscal 1992 MIGA entered into three&#13;
reinsurance arrangements with national insurers from Canada and the United States and&#13;
into its first agreement with a private political risk insurer, Nordia.&#13;
The reinsurance of Nordia - for an investment in El Salvador by AVX Corporation,&#13;
a U.S.-based company majority-owned by Kyocera Corporation of Japan - is an&#13;
interesting example of two investment insurers cooperating to meet the needs of an&#13;
investor whose project is making a significant contribution to the local economy.&#13;
AVX Corporation has manufactured electronic capacitors in El Salvador since 1977.&#13;
At that time, as a U.S .-owned company, AVX purchased political risk insurance from the&#13;
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a U.S. government agency that&#13;
provides insurance for U.S. investments in other countries. When AVX merged with&#13;
Kyocera in 1990, however, it became ineligible for OPIC coverage, and it was not&#13;
eligible forJapanese governmentpolitical risk insurance because the company was based&#13;
in the United States. AVX was in a bind. Private insurers, its only apparent alternative&#13;
for insuring its existing investment, were unwilling at the time to provide political risk&#13;
insurance in El Salvador.&#13;
AVX approached MIGA about insuring a proposed expansion in its Salvadoran&#13;
operations, at the same time asking whether MIGA could insure the existing investment.&#13;
Although MIGA does not directly insure existing investments, it has a limited ability to&#13;
do so under certain circumstances through its reinsurance facility. Considering the size&#13;
of the expansion and the importance of the project to the economy of El Salvador, MIGA&#13;
agreed to insure the expansion investment. And, since a private political risk insurer was&#13;
willing to assume the primary risk on the existing investment, MIGA also agreed to&#13;
reinsure that investment. Nordia, through its U.S. agent, Pan Financial, underwrote the&#13;
risk based on MIGA's willingness to reinsure 50 percent of its liability.&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA and financial institutions&#13;
Many financial institutions today are cautious about making investments in developing&#13;
countries or increasing their country exposure because of concerns about political risk and&#13;
special provisioning requirements. MIGA's political risk guarantee program can be&#13;
particularly attractive to financial institutions in these situations. MIGA can insure a variety&#13;
of bank investments, including such equity investments as those derived from debt-equity&#13;
swaps, currency swaps, and expansion of branch capital, as well as loans to nonrelated&#13;
borrowers. MIGA can also insure a guarantee that a bank may require from the foreign&#13;
sponsor of a project in a developing country.&#13;
Since MIGA provides long-term, noncancellable insurance against political risks and is&#13;
a member of the World Bank Group, bank regulators in some countries have exempted&#13;
commercial banks from special provisioning requirements for country risk on their loans&#13;
or investments insured by MIGA. To date such exemptions have been explicitly granted by&#13;
banking authorities in France and Spain. Regulatory authorities in other countries are&#13;
expected to make similar rulings shortly.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Since MIGA began to intensively market its program to the banking community less than&#13;
a year ago, the response from banks has exceeded expectations. Insurance contracts issued&#13;
to banks for all forms and types of investment represent 19 percent of all contracts executed&#13;
to date and 38 percent of MIGA' s total contingent liability. All the contracts were concluded&#13;
this fiscal year.&#13;
By insuring financial institutions, MIGA is able to make an important contribution to the&#13;
development of the financial sector in many developing countries.&#13;

Exploring new opportunities&#13;
for investmentin Pakistan&#13;
Over 400 private investors from more than forty countries met in Islamabad, Pakistan&#13;
in November 1991 to explore the new business opportunities that opened up as the&#13;
country reformed its policies and turned more attention to the growth potential of its&#13;
private sector.&#13;
The three-day investment promotion conference -  the fourth such conference&#13;
organized by MIGA- brought together foreign business executives and more than 200&#13;
local entrepreneurs. Conference participants were able to examine, first hand, invest-&#13;
ment opportunities in agribusiness, leather and textiles, the electrical and electronics&#13;
industries, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and engineering.&#13;
Foreign investors heard directly from senior government officials about the recent&#13;
reforms affecting foreign investment and about the govermnent's commitmnent to an&#13;
open and dynamic economy. in his keynote address Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#13;
highlighted the reforms of the past year, noting: "We are also determined to provide&#13;
constitutional protection to these measures. I would therefore like to announce in no&#13;
uncertain terms that the stability of investment incentives is, and will be, guaranteed by&#13;
law."&#13;
At the conclusion of the conference, the Pakistan government estimated that $600&#13;
million in commitments through the exchange of letters of intent between potential joint&#13;
venture partners had been made. The government has embarked on an aggressive follow-&#13;
up program to continue to encourage conference participants to invest in Pakistan,&#13;
establishing a special coordinating committee for this purpose.&#13;

Learning how to do business with foreign partners&#13;
With the theme Doing business with foreign partners, MIGA introduced its first&#13;
executive development program to twenty-three managers from Portuguese-speaking&#13;
countries in Africa (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, and Sao Tome&#13;
and Principe). The five-day program, held in Portugal in September 1991, was part of a&#13;
larger effort to promote foreign direct investment in Lusophone African countries by&#13;
helping them build the institutional structures needed for the transition to private sector-&#13;
led development. MIGA established a special Fund for Investment Promotion in&#13;
Lusophone Africa (FIPLA), sponsored by prominent international corporations and&#13;
multilateral agencies such as the United Nations Development Program and the Africa&#13;
Project Development Facility of the International Finance Corporation. The fund will&#13;
support MIGA's promotional activities in Lusophone Africa.&#13;
As a follow-up to this program MIGA organized an executive development program&#13;
for Angola in April 1992. About seventy business executives, most of them from the&#13;
private sector, participated in discussions on developing and operating with a business&#13;
plan, negotiating strategies and applications, and exploring prospects for foreign&#13;
investment in Angola.&#13;
MIGA also organized executive development programs in Central European coun-&#13;
tries, for the emerging private sector. Programs in Hungary (September 1991) and the&#13;
Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (October 1991) exposed some 120 participants to "a&#13;
new way of thinking and new methods" and encouraged participants to identify and&#13;
develop aspects of their business and management that would attract foreign partners.&#13;
The programs emphasized Managing the searchforforeign partners as a way to increase&#13;
foreign direct investment in these countries. The programs were cosponsored with&#13;
domestic banks and introduced the practice of banking institutions offering a wider range&#13;
of services to their clients in these countries.&#13;
Senior business managers from the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic discuss how to develop business plans&#13;
and attract foreign investment partners at an executive development program organized by MIGA in Prague,&#13;
October 1991.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Sharing successful experiences among developing countries:&#13;
policies that attract foreign direct investment&#13;
Over the past twenty years developing countries have had very different experiences&#13;
in attracting foreign direct investment. A small group of about a dozen countries, such&#13;
as Thailand and Malaysia, has been very successful in attracting foreign investment. But&#13;
for most other developing countries, particularly in Africa, the annual inflow of&#13;
investment has actually declined or stagnated at low levels. For African countries the&#13;
outlook for the 1990s remains difficult, given the exceptionally stiff worldwide compe-&#13;
tition for foreign investment capital. These countries will need to take bold steps to&#13;
improve their attractiveness to investors.&#13;
At a roundtable conference organized by MIGA and hosted by the government of&#13;
Botswana, high-level African officials had a unique opportunity to discuss strategies&#13;
with their peers from countries that have had success in attracting foreign investment.&#13;
The roundtable conference, held in June 1992, brought together a group of 16 ministers&#13;
and high government officials from several Sub-Sahara African countries, with six&#13;
senior government officials from developing countries that have been successful in&#13;
attracting foreign investment. This dialogue was enriched through the exchange of views&#13;
between the African policy makers and about a half dozen senior managers from private&#13;
multinational companies.&#13;
The three-day conference showed clearly that foreign investors desire, above all, a&#13;
stable and predictable environment - economic, social, legal, and political. Their&#13;
investment plans are influenced by their assessment of how even-handedly and scrupu-&#13;
lously a country carries out agreements reached with a private partner, how fairly its legal&#13;
system functions, and how stable its overall political situation is. Foreign investors also&#13;
look for straightforward procedures and speedy processing, a minimum of government&#13;
interference in day-to-day business operations, and a competitive economic environment.&#13;
Senior policy makers from African countries and other developing countries met to discuss successful&#13;
strategies in attracting foreign investment, at a MIGA-organized Roundtable on Foreign Direct Investment&#13;
Policies in Africa, in Botswana, June 1992.&#13;

:   FIAS support of MIGA member countries in Africa&#13;
In Sub-Saharan Africa FIAS has assisted fourteen MIGA member countries and eight&#13;
MIGA signatory nations. Recent examples highlight the speed with which improve-&#13;
ments are being made in the investment environment with FIAS assistance.&#13;
Since mid-1990 FIAS has assisted the government of Malawi in preparing an&#13;
investment policy statement, an investors guide, and a statute for establishing an&#13;
investment promotion agency, all of which have been embodied in legislation passed by&#13;
Parliament. These measures greatly simplify the regulatory requirements of business&#13;
registration, establishment, and land acquisition, and have improved investment incen-&#13;
tives and the investor services provided by the government. FIAS is now launching a&#13;
program of institution-building assistance to the new promotion agency, supported in&#13;
part by a World Bank credit.&#13;
In Namibia FIAS work since early 1992 has helped in the drafting of new investment&#13;
legislation designed to substantially improve the investment incentives, facilities, and&#13;
institutional arrangements for the approval and promotion of investment. FIAS has also&#13;
been asked to help draft an investment policy statement, for which work is already under&#13;
way, and to help develop investment promotion strategies and programs for the country.&#13;

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agencv&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
June 30, 1992 and June 30, 1991&#13;
Statement of Agency Purpose&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGAj is a member of the World Bank Group&#13;
designed to help developing countries attract productive foreign investment by both private&#13;
investors and commercially operated public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees&#13;
against noncommercial risks and a program of consultative and advisory services to promote&#13;
improvements in member countries environments for foreign investment.&#13;
The Agency was established on April 12, 1988, when 29 countries ratified the MIGA&#13;
Convention, and their subscriptions totaled 53.38 percent of the Agency's authorized capital.&#13;
Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with Intemational Accounting&#13;
Standards. In the absence of such standards, then, subject to relevant legal requirements, the&#13;
policy adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having regard&#13;
to the accounting principles used in the United States and the practices of other international&#13;
insurance entities. The following summary of policies adopted by MIGA is provided to assist&#13;
readers in the interpretation of these financial statements. The accounting policies followed&#13;
generally are consistent in all material respects with accounting principles in the United States.&#13;
Translation of Currencies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the&#13;
purpose of summarizing financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience&#13;
of its members and other interested parties.&#13;
MIGA is an international organization that conducts its operations in the currencies of all its&#13;
members. MIGA's resources are derived from its capital and accumulated eamings in its&#13;
members' currencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency&#13;
environment. As such. MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one currency&#13;
with assets in the same currency.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions to match the currencies&#13;
underlying its reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies. The purpose of these&#13;
conversions will be to minimize currency exposure that may occur through operations.&#13;
Otherwise, MIGA will not convert one currency into anotherexcept for small amounts required&#13;
to meet certain operational needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period. Capital&#13;
subscriptions are stated in accordance with the procedures described below. Income and&#13;
expenses are generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect during&#13;
each month. Translation adjustments are charged or credited to retained earnings.&#13;

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
June 30, 1992 and June 30, 1991&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
Under the Convention of MIGA, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock&#13;
of MIGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the SDR in terms of United States&#13;
dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one&#13;
SDR.&#13;
Investments&#13;
MIGA's investment holdings are valued at market, with both realized and unrealized gains and&#13;
losses included in income from investments.&#13;
Due to the nature of the investments held by the Agency and its policies governing the level and&#13;
use of such investments, the Agency classifies the investment portfolio as an element of liquidity&#13;
in the Statement of Cash Flows.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenue from premium payments for both direct and assumed reinsurance contracts is&#13;
recognized on a pro rata basis over the contract period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for any losses inherent in guarantee operations based upon claim&#13;
submissions, consideration of loss experiences by insurers engaged in similar underwritings.&#13;
and other factors including changes in the composition and volume of the insurance and&#13;
outstanding guarantees and worldwide economic and political conditions. The reserve is&#13;
increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased for claims settlements.&#13;
Acquisition Costs&#13;
Costs of acquiring investment guarantees are expensed in the year incurred, as such amounts are&#13;
not material.&#13;
Note B: Investments&#13;
As of June 30, 1992. the investment portfolio was valued at market, which approximates cost.&#13;
The investment portfolio was denominated primarily in United States dollars with instruments&#13;
in nondollar currencies representing 19.4 percent of the portfolio.&#13;

coverage against four different categories of risk: currency transfer, expropriation, war and civil&#13;
disturbance, and breach of contract. Investors may insure projects for any combination of the&#13;
four types of coverage. MIGA guarantees, other than those issued as reinsurance, cannot be&#13;
terminated unilaterally by the parties within the first three years from the date of issuance.&#13;
Premium rates applicable to issued contracts are fixed for five years. Payments against all claims&#13;
under a guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage issued under the guarantee.&#13;
In accordance with Article 22(a) of the Convention and paragraph 3.50 in the Operational&#13;
Regulations, the Agency, unless determined otherwise by the Council of Governors, currently&#13;
shall not issue any guarantee that would raise the outstanding aggregate amount of contingent&#13;
liabilities above 150 percent of the sum of the Agency's unimpaired subscribed capital and&#13;
retained earnings, plus under certain conditions, 90 percent of the insurance ceded by the&#13;
Agency through contracts of reinsurance. The maximum amount shall not, under any circum-&#13;
stances. exceed five times the amount of the Agency's unimpaired subscribed capital, its&#13;
retained earnings, and such portion of its insurance ceded as may be deemed appropriate.&#13;

fairly, in all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position&#13;
of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency at June 30. 1992 and 1991, and the&#13;
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with&#13;
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and with International&#13;
Accounting Standards. These financial statements are the responsibility of management&#13;
of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency: our responsibility is to express an&#13;
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of&#13;
these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including&#13;
International Auditing Guidelines, which require that we plan and perform the audit to&#13;
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material&#13;

            MIGA is the newest affiliate of the
            World Bank Group. It cooperates closely with the other Group
            members in carrying out its dual mandate of offering
            investment guarantees and promotional and advisory services.
            MIGA's membership is open to all member countries of
            the World Bank and Switzerland. MIGA continues its intensive
            negotiations around the world, explaining membership
            criteria and benefits to countries, thereby smoothing the
            way for more countries to become members. In fiscal 1992, 14
            countries signed the MIGA Convention, bringing the total to
            115. India became the thirteenth Asian country to sign the
            Convention. Many republics of the former Soviet Union are
            expected to become signatories shortly. Twenty-one countries
            completed MIGA membership procedures, bring the number of
            full members to 85. The new members are Albania, Argentina,
            Belize, Bolivia, Republic of Congo, Dominica, El Salvador,
            Ethiopia, Honduras, Israel, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Nicaragua,
            Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda,
            Yugoslavia, and Zimbabwe. The increase in membership raised
            MIGA's subscribed capital by 7 percent to $844 million.
