A.     BACKGROUND&#13;
For the first time in history more than half the world's people live in cities. Over 90 percent of urban&#13;
growth is occurring in the developing world, adding an estimated 70 million new residents to urban&#13;
areas each year. Successful cities change their ways, improve their finances, attract private investors,&#13;
and take care of the poor. However, the demands of poverty alleviation, climate change and&#13;
sustainable growth will put today's developing country cities to the test. Within cities of developing&#13;
countries, a sharper focus on climate change adaptation and the expected positive impacts and&#13;
outcomes associated with the implementation of related measures will require retooling approaches to&#13;
urban management and investment planning. This Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Sustainable Urban&#13;
Development (the "MDTF") contributes to the operationalization of the Bank's 2009 Urban Strategy,&#13;
which emphasizes sustainable urban development and equity and inclusion for growth and poverty&#13;
