MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND&#13;
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION&#13;
AND RESULTS OF OPERATION&#13;
1. OVERVIEW&#13;
Internationa Finance Corporation (iFC or the Corporation) is an international organization, established in 1956 to further economic growth in its developing member&#13;
countries by promoting private sector development. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction anc&#13;
Development (IBRD or the World Bank), the International Development Association (IDA), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). It is a lega&#13;
entity separate and distinct from the World Bank, IDA, and MIGA, with its own Articles of Agreement, share capital, financial structure, management, and staft.&#13;
Membership in IFC is open only to member countries of the World Bank. As of June 30, 2001, IFC's entire share capital was held by 175 member countries.&#13;
IFC's principal products are loans and equity investments, with a small but growing guarantee portfolio. Unlike most multilateral development institutions, IFC&#13;
does not accept host government guarantees. I FC raises virtually all of the funds for its lend ng activities through the issuance of debt ob igations in the internationa&#13;
capital markets, while mainta ning a small borrowinig window with the World Bank. Equity investnients are funded from net worth. During the year ended June 30,&#13;
2001 (FY01), IFC had an authorized borrowing ceiling of $4.0 billion. Under th s authority, IFC was authorized to borrow up to $200 million (5%) under a facility&#13;
with the World Bank.&#13;
IFC's capital base and its assets ard liabilities are primarily in US dolars. The Corporation seeks to minimize market risk (foreign exchange and interest rate&#13;
risks) by closely matching the currency, rate bases, and maturity of its liabilities in various currencies with assets with the same characteristics. The Corporatior&#13;
controls residual market risk by utilizing currency and interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.&#13;
11. FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
The Corporation has tracitionally prepared one set of financial statements, complying with both generally accepted accounting princples in the United States&#13;
(US GAAP) and International Accounting Standards (IAS). However, due to the promulgation of US Statement ot Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)&#13;
No. 133. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and HedgingActivities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Certain Hedging&#13;
Relationships (collectively SFAS No. 133), it is no longer possible for the Corporation to satisfy the requirements of both US GAAP and IAS via one set of&#13;
financial statements. Accordingly, as explained in the Corporation's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2001 (FY01) the accounting and reporting&#13;
policies conform with US GAAP, and the Corporation has presented in Note T to the FY01 financial statements a balance sheet and income statement conforming&#13;
with IAS, together with a reconciliation between US GAAP and IAS.&#13;
Unless stated otherwise, discussions of financial performance refer to operating income excluding the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133. The effects of SFAS&#13;
No. 133 on net income are discussed in Section VI.&#13;
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY&#13;
From year to year, IFC's operating income is affected by a number of factors, principally the magnitude of provisions for oasses against its loans, equity&#13;
investmrents, and guarantees; loans in nonaccrual status; and income (dividends and capital gains) generated from its equity portfolio.&#13;
Beginning in FY01, the Corporation classified all liquid asset securities as trading securities. As such, unrealized and realized gains and losses on a I liquid&#13;
asset securities are recorded in operating income. Prior to FY01, unrealized gains and losses on liquid asset securities classified as availa ble for sale were excluded&#13;
from operating income until realized. A significant part of IFC's liquid assets portfolio is invested in fixed-income securities, which are also subject to external&#13;
market factors that affect the value of such securities, adding variability to operating income.&#13;
Beginn ng in FY01, net income also includes unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments other than from trading activities, pursuant to the&#13;
implementation of SFAS No. 133.&#13;
IFC has been consistently profitable since its inception in 1956, and operating income for FY01 was $241 million as compared with $380 million for the&#13;
year ended June 30, 2000 (FY00), and $249 million for the year ended June 30, 1999 (FY99).&#13;

BUSINESS OVERVIEW&#13;
In partnership with private investors, IFC ass sts in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector enterprises by making investments&#13;
where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC seeks to bring together domestc and foreign private capital and experienced&#13;
management and thereby create condiions conducive to the flow of private capital, domestic and foreign, into productive investments in its developing member&#13;
countries. In this way, IFC plays a catalytic ro e in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, errher through cofinancing or through loan&#13;
syndications, underwritings, and guarantees, In addition to project finance and resource mobilization, IFC offers financial and technica advisory services to private&#13;
businesses in develop ng member countries. It also advises member governments on private sector development matters.&#13;
IFC's investments are normally made in its developing member countries The Articles of Agreement mandate that IFC shall invest in productive prvate&#13;
enterprise. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly owned by the public sector, if such enterprises are organized under&#13;
local conrmercial and corporate law, operate free of host government control in a market context and according to profitabi ity criteria, and/or are n the process of&#13;
being totally or partially privatized&#13;
The Corporation's main investment activity is project financing. This encompasses "greenfield" projects, expansions, and modernizations IFC also provides&#13;
corporate credits to se ected compan es to finance ongoing programs of investment projects. In addition, the Corporation facilitates financing through financial&#13;
internmed aries, covering project and genieral purpose lend ng anid specialized leriding prrdurls such as leasing, trade. and mnortgage finance. These firianrial&#13;
intermediaries function either as IFC's borrower, on- ending to private sector companies at their own risk, or as IFCs agent, Identifying companies for direct loans&#13;
from IFO&#13;
The Corporaton applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability, and developmental impact in determining the eligibility of projects for&#13;
its nvestments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
INVESTMENT PROCESS AND PORTFOLIO SUPERVISION&#13;
IFC's investment process can be divided into six main stages:&#13;
CIdentification &amp; appraisal -4    CBard approval --    CDcument negotiation -4          C    ommitment -*    CDibursement -          CSupervision&#13;
The initial four stages are carried out under the responsibility of the Vice President, Operations, while the fifth and sixth stages are overseen by the Vice&#13;
President, Portfolio and Risk Management.&#13;
The Corporation carefully supervises its projects to monitor project performance and compliance with contractuaI obligations and with IFC's interna policies&#13;
and procedures. IFC's Board of Directors is informed of such matters and of recommended courses of action at regular intervals.&#13;

Approvals pending commitment at June 30, 2001, including guarantees and client risk management facilities, were $3.9 billion ($4.3 billion at June 30,&#13;
2000). During FY01, the Corporation entered into new commitments totaling $2.7 billion, including $0.5 billion of signed guarantees, compared with $2.4 billion&#13;
for FY00. Loan and equity investment commitments pending disbursement at June 30, 2001, were $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion at June 30, 2000). Guarantees and&#13;
client risk management facilities committed but not utilized at June 30, 2001, were $0.7 billion ($0.3 billion at June 30, 2000). IFC disbursed $1.5 billion in&#13;
FY01 ($2.2 billion in FYOO). The lower level of disbursements in FY01 is partly attributable to the changing product mix in FY01 from direct investment&#13;
products such as loans and equity investments to off-balance sheet products such as guarantees. At June 30, 2001, IFC's disbursed and outstanding loans and&#13;
equity investments for its own account (disbursed investment portfolio) were $10.9 billion, unchanged from June 30, 2000.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
INVESTMENT PRODUCTS&#13;
Loans&#13;
Loans account for the major part of the financing provided by IFC, representing 75% of the Corporation's disbursed investment porttfoio as of June 30, 2001i,&#13;
compared with 76% at June 30, 2000.&#13;
Loans will generally have the following characterist cs:&#13;
* Term: typically amortizing with final maturities of up to 12 years&#13;
* Currency: primarily in major convertible currencies, principally US dollar, euro, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen&#13;
* Interest rate: fixed or variable&#13;
* Pricing: reflects such factors as market conditions and country and project risks; variable rate loans are generally tied to the 6-month LIBOR index in th-&#13;
relevant currency.&#13;
Since FY99, IFC has offered local currency loan products to certain clients, provided the Corporation is able to hedge its iocai currency exposure througri&#13;
mechanisms such as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Fixed-rate loans and lcans in other currencies are normally transformed, using currency and/ci&#13;
interest rate swaps, into US doilar variable rate loans.&#13;
On June 30, 2001, total lcans disbursed and outstanding were $8.2 blion ($8.3 billion at JLne 30, 2000). At June 30, 2001,91 % of the Corporation's oans&#13;
were US dollar-denominated, unchanged from June 30, 2000. The currency composition of the loan portfolio is shown on the accompanying diagram:&#13;

Equity&#13;
Equity investments accounted for 25% of the Corporation's disbursed investment portfolio at June 30, 2001, compared with 24% at June 30, 2030. IFC's equity&#13;
investments are typically in the form of common or preferred stock and are usualiy denominated in the currency of the country in which tfe investment is made.&#13;
Quasi-equity&#13;
In addition to traditional equity nvestments, the Corporation provides financing through a variety of quasi-equity instruments, which constitute a small but growing&#13;
portion of its investment portfolio. Quasi-equities include subordinated or convertible loans, asset-backed securities, and certain common or preferred shares&#13;
with put and/or call features. Depending upon their characteristics, quasi-equities may be classified as either loans or equity investments in the Corporation's&#13;
balance sheet. At June 30, 2001, the Corporation's disbursed and outstanding quasi-equity portfolio totaled $1,326 million ($1,186 million at June 30, 2000),&#13;
of which $1,160 million was classified as loans ($1,060 milion at June 30, 2000) and $166 million ($126 million at June 30, 2000) was classified as equity&#13;
investments in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
Loan participations (B-loans)&#13;
IFC finances only a portion, usually not more than 25%, of the cost of any protect. All IFC-financed projects, therefore, require other financial partners. The&#13;
principal direct means by which the Corporation mobilizes such private sector finance is through the sase of participations in its loans, known as the B-loan program.&#13;
Through tl-e B-loan program, IFC has cooperated primarily with conmercial barks but also with nonbank financial institutions in financing projects since the&#13;
early 1960s. More than 215 commercial banks and institutional investors currently participate in IFC's B-loan program.&#13;
Whenever it syndicates a loan, IFC will always make a loan for its own account (an A-loan), thereby sharing the risk alongside its loan partic pants. IFC acts&#13;
as the lender of record and is responsible for the administration of the entire loan, inc uding the B eoan. FC charges fees tc the borrower at prevailing market&#13;
-ates to cover the cost of the syndication of the B-loan. Since it began its loan syndication program, IFC has placed participations totaling $19.8 billion.&#13;
a7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Client risk management services&#13;
IFC provides c.ients access to asset and liability management tools such as currency swaps and interest rate swaps, caps, and floors by acting as an&#13;
intermediary between clients and market counterparties. IFC also provides risk-sharing structures and guarantees that allow its clients to transact directly with&#13;
market counterparties The Corporat on requires that all transactions are for hedging purposes only&#13;
Guarantees and partial risk guarantees&#13;
Giarantees represent a grow ng product line for the Corporation Beginning in FY01, the Corporation began offering partial risk guarantees to clients covering,&#13;
on a risk-sharing basis, client oblgations on bonds and/or loans. The Corporation's guarantee is available for debt instruments and trade obligat ons of clients&#13;
and covers commercia as we as noncommercial risks IFC will provide local currency guarantees but generally only if the Corporation is able to fund its&#13;
commitment in local currency terms, for example, by hedging its exposure in the swap market. Guarantee fees are charged consistent w th IFC's loan pr c ng&#13;
policies. During FY01, the Corporation signed $0.5 billion of guarantees, as compared with less than $0 1 billion n FY00&#13;
Underwritings and investment banking services&#13;
IFC provides underwriting and placement services for equity, quasi-equ ty, ann/or debt securities issues of private sector companies in IFC's developing member&#13;
countries. It viso structures and underwnrtes country funds and pooled irvestrinent vehicles such as private investrnent funds. IFC is often a core investor in the&#13;
enterprnses it underwrites. Services are priced in conformity with market standards and practices, in consultation with international securities firms and financial&#13;
intermediaries. Underwnr ng and other capital markets services requiring a financal commitment from IFC are subject to the same investment criteria and limits&#13;
applicable to its loans and equity investments.&#13;
The Corporation does not conduct any placement activities within the United States or directed at US investors in connection with securities offerings of&#13;
private sector companies or pooled investment vehicles.&#13;
Advisory activities&#13;
The Corporabon, on its own or through a department jointly managed with the World Bank, provides three general types of advisory services to member&#13;
countries as well as to individual enterprises:&#13;
* Special advisory services on project structur ng and financial packaging&#13;
* Financial advisory services provided to rnember governments or to private sector clients&#13;
* Policy advice to governments en capital markets development and private sector development, including privatization and foreign investment.&#13;
The Corporation also assists governments with developing the legal framework for privatizing their state-owned sectors, as well as with the sale of individual&#13;
enterprises Fees are charged for advisory serv ces consistent with rarket rates charged for comparable services. IFC charged fees amounting 'a $41 m I ion&#13;
for FY01 ($49 milion for FY00 and $33 million for FY99).&#13;
Specially targeted assistance&#13;
IFC has established a number of vehicles through which it provides specially targeted assistance to areas highly n need ofdevelopment. In FY0I, the Corporation&#13;
contributed $16 million to such vehicles, compared with $7 milion in FY00 and $3 milion in FY99. In FY01, such vehicles included:&#13;
* The World Bank Group's Clooal SME Capacity Building Facility, launched in September 2000 to act as a special window to encourage new models for small&#13;
and medium enterprise support throughout the developing world&#13;
* The Frontier Prvatization Fund, aimed at providing advisory funding support to resolve privatization issues and related transactional constraints in fronter&#13;
markets worldwide.&#13;
The Coreoration continues to fund its Technical Assistance Trust Funds to provide resources through which it cofinances technical assistance fundng&#13;
supported hy donor agencies and finances stand-alone technical assistance where donor finding cannot he arranged&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. TREASURY SERVICES&#13;
LIQUID ASSETS&#13;
IFC invests its surplus liquidity in highly rated fixed and floating rate instruments issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments, government agencie~;&#13;
and instrumentalities, multilateral organizations, and AAA-rated corporate issuers, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and in time deposits anc&#13;
other unconditional obligations of banks and financial institutions.&#13;
The Corporation manages the market risk associated with these investments through a variety of hedgingtechniques including derivatives, principally, currenc,&#13;
and interest rate swaps and financial futures.&#13;
IFC's liquid assets are invested in four separate portfolios.&#13;

The P3 portfolio is not permitted to exceed 12% of the total value of liquid assets at any time.&#13;
The Pi and P2 portfolios were accounted for as available for sale portfolios through June 30, 2000. Effective July 1, 2000, these portfolios were&#13;
redesignated as trading portfoiios to more closely reflect the management style of the portfolios as discussed in Note A to the Corporation's financial statements&#13;
for the year ended June 30, 2001. The P0 and P3 portfolios are also accounted for as trading portfolios.&#13;
All liquid assets are managed according to an nvestment authority approved by I FC's Board of Directors and investment guidelines approved by IFC's Finance&#13;
and Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the Management Group.&#13;
CAPITALIZATION&#13;
The Corporation's capitalization as of June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2000 is as follows:&#13;
FYO1                      FYO0&#13;
Borrowings from market sources&#13;
Borrowings from the World Bank&#13;
~ Paid-in capital&#13;
~ Retained earnings &amp; other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Borrowings&#13;
The major source of IFC's norrowings is the international capital markets. Under the Articles of Agreement, the Corporation may borrow n the public markets&#13;
of a member country only with approvals from that member and also the member in whose currency the borrowing is denominated The Corporation borrowed&#13;
$3.6 billion during FY01 ($4.4 billion in FY00 and $4.5 billion in FY99). In addition. IFC's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase and redemption of,&#13;
and tender for, debt obligations issued by the Corporation. During FY01, the Corporation repurchased and retired $134 million of outstanding debt ($200 miliion&#13;
in FY00).&#13;
IFC diversifies ts borrowings by currency, couintry. source, and maturity to provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Outstanding market borrowings have&#13;
remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to almost 30 years with a weighted average life of 7.2 years at J une 30, 2001 (6.7 years at June 30. 2000).&#13;
Market borrowings are generally swapped into floating-rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30, 2001, the Corporation had gross payables&#13;
from borrowing-related currency swaps of $10 6 billion ($11.0 billion at June 30, 2000) and from borrowing-related interest rate swaps in the notional principal&#13;
amount of $6.3 billion ($5.1 billion at June 30, 2000). After considering the effect of these derivative instruments all of the Corporation's market borrowings at&#13;
June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2000 were US dollar-denominated.&#13;
The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 4.3% at June 30, 2001, compared with 6.3% at&#13;
June 30, 2000.&#13;
Capital and retained earnings&#13;
As of June 30, 2001, IFC's net worth (presented as Total Capital in the Corporation's balance sheet) amounted to $6.1 billion, up from the June 30, 2000, level&#13;
of $5.7 billion.&#13;
As of June 30, 2001, and 2000, IFC's authorized capital was $2.45 billion, of which $2.37 billion was subscribed at June 30, 2001, unchanged from June&#13;
30, 2000. Over 99% of this was paid in ($2 36 billion at June 30, 2001, and J.ne 30, 2000). The subscription period for the share allocations made under the&#13;
1992 capital increases (as described in Note I to the Corporation's FY01 financial statements) c osed on August 1, 1999. The Corporation agreed, however, to&#13;
defer the payment dates for certain member countries until August 1, 2001. Pursuant to these arrangements, $14 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid&#13;
at June 30, 2001, unchanged from June 30, 2000.&#13;
V. RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL POLICIES&#13;
RISK IN IFC'S BUSINESS&#13;
IFC assumes various kinds of risks in its private sector development business. The Corporation's operations and activities are princ pally subject to commercial&#13;
or project nsk, credi risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operatonal risk. Active management of these risks is an essential part of the Corporation's operations&#13;
and a key determinant of its ability to maintain a stable capital and earnings base. To this end, it has adopted several key financial policies and a number of&#13;
prudential pol cies.&#13;
KEY FINANCIAL POLICIES&#13;
IFC currently operates under the foliowing key financial policies which have been approved by its Board of Directors:&#13;
1. Disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of loss reserves) may not exceed 100% of net worth.&#13;
2. Disbursed equity investments (net of loss reserves) may not exceed 50% of IFC's net worth.&#13;
3. Minimum liquidity (including liquid assets and undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) must be sufficient at all times to cover at least 65%&#13;
of IFC's estimated net cash requirements for the next three years.&#13;
4. The currency, rate bas s, and maturity of loan assets must be closely matched to borrowings.&#13;
5. Capital (including paid-in capital. retained earnings, and general loss reserve) must equal at least 30% of risk-weighted assets.&#13;
In addition, under IFC's Articles of Agreement, as long as PFC has outstanding borrowings from the World Bank, IFC's leverage, as measured by the ratio of&#13;
IFC's debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to IFC's equity (subscribed capital plus retained earnings), may not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;
MANAGING COMMERCIAL (PROJECT) RISK&#13;
IFC is prohibited from accepting host government guarantees of repayment on its investments and therefore incurs the commercial risk of its investments. In&#13;
addition to the key financial policies specified above, the Corporation's investments are subject to a number of operational or prudential I mits inciuding&#13;
limitations on single project exposure, single country exposure, and segment concentration. Thus:&#13;
1. IFC does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a project's cost.&#13;
2. An equity investment in a company does not normally represent more than 35% of the company's total share capital, provided further that IFC is not the&#13;
single largest shareholder.&#13;
3. An investment in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of IFC's total investment portfolio.&#13;
4. Equity and quasi-equity investments in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of the Corporation's net worth plus general reserves.&#13;
5. Total investments in a single country will not normally represent more than 12% of IFC's total investment portfolio or 25% of its net worth, whichever is lower.&#13;
6. The Corporation's total exposure to a single risk sector may not exceed 8% of the total investment portfolio.&#13;
The quality of IFC's investment portfolo is monitored according to established supervision procedures. The portfolio management units of individual&#13;
investment departments are responsible for the day-to-day monitoring and management of commercial risk associated with projects originated by the&#13;
departments, including monitoring and evaluating credit quality of the borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Managing credit risk: loss reserves policy&#13;
Credit risk refers to the potential for a borrower, or a counterparty to a transaction with IFC, to default on its financial obligations to the Corporation. IFC's Credit&#13;
Review Department analyzes information obtained from the investment departments and provides an independent review of the credit risk of IFC's borrowers&#13;
IFC maintains its loss reserves and revenue recognition policies in accordance with US GAAP0 IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibilit,&#13;
is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days un ess management anticipates that collection of interest is expected in the&#13;
near future.&#13;
IFC's loss reserves po icy ref ects management's judgment in accordance with the following guidelines In the case of specific loss reserves, IFC considers a&#13;
loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it wi I be unable to collect all amounts due accordong to the loan's contractual&#13;
terms. The reserve against losses for impaired loans represents management's judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's,&#13;
effective interest rate. IFC establishes a reserve against losses for equity investments when a decrease in value of the investment nas occurred, below its US dolla'&#13;
equivalent cost, which is considered other than temporary. In addition to the reserve or specific investments, the reserve against losses includes an estimate of&#13;
probable losses on loans and equity investments .nherent in the portfoi,o but not specificaliy dentifiable. The reserve against losses is maintained through annual&#13;
charges to income in the form of a provision for losses. Investments written off, as weli as any subsequent recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
Management determines the total loss reserves by judgment tak ng into account internal guidelines and its assessment of recent portfolio quality trends anc&#13;
near-term outlook. The guidelines help management in decision making; however, these guidelines cannot replace management's judgment. The guidelnes focus&#13;
on the total loss reserve requirement (specific plus general loss reserves) inherent in the portfolio based on information available at the time of the rev ew. The&#13;
guidelines reference portfolio impairment based on simulation tecnniques, portfoiio impairment based on country risk, and portfolio impairment based on&#13;
ong-term historical portfolio experience. After determination by management of the adequate level of total loss reserves using the aforementioned techniques,&#13;
and an extens ve investment-by-investment review of specific impairment, the general loss reserve is calculated as the difference between the total loss reserves&#13;
and the total specific loss reserves.&#13;
The amount of nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, a key indicator of porrfolio performance, deteriorated to 12.9% at June 30,&#13;
2001, comDared with 11.1% at June 30, 2000. The principal amount outstanding on nonaccruing loans totaled $1,054 million at June 30, 2001, an increase of&#13;
14% from the June 30, 2000, level of $922 million.&#13;
The quality of IlC's investment portfolio deteriorated in FY01, as measured by the average weighted rsk class of the portfolio. Furthermore, the impairment&#13;
probabilities and severity level probabilities increased, as did the country risk ratings of a significant number of countr es and the Corporation's exposure in a number&#13;
of higher risk countries. As a result, total reserves against losses on loans and equity investments at June 30, 2001, increased to $2,213 million ($1,973 million&#13;
at June 30. 2000). This is equivalent to 20.3% of the disbursed porrfol o, up from 18.0%/ at the end of FYOC and higher than the historical high of 18.2% reached&#13;
at the end of FY99.&#13;
The five-year trend of loss reserves is presented below:&#13;

Given that IFC has had very lim ted history with guarantees, IFC is working under the assumption that the guarantee portfo io is exposed to the same&#13;
idiosyncratc and systematic risks as IFC's loan portfolio, and the inherent, probable losses in the guarantee portfolio need to be covered by an allowance for&#13;
loss. Beginning in FY01, the Corporation has established such an allowance totaling $13.0 million based on the year-end portfolio which is included in payables&#13;
and other liabilities on the balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MANAGING LIQUIDITY RISK&#13;
The Corporat on's Liquidity Policy, as approved by its Board of Directors, requires the maintenance at all times of sufficient liquidity (including liquid assets and&#13;
undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) to cover at least 65% of its estimated net cash requirements for the next three years. As a prudential&#13;
measure, the Corporaton maintains an operating liquidity target of not less than 70% of three years' net cash requirements, includ-ig projected disbursement&#13;
and debt service requirements. At June 30, 2301, the Corporation's liq uidity level stood at $13.3 billion, or 101% of its projected net cash requirements for three&#13;
years ($12.2 billion, and 103% at June 30, 2000).&#13;
MANAGING MARKET RISK&#13;
Market risk reters to changes in values of financiaI nstruments or postons due to movements in nterest or excharge rates, or to liqudity factors. IFC manages&#13;
market risk by adopting a matched-funding pDlicy and by using a variety of derivative nstruments to convert assets and iabilities into 6-month floating US dollar&#13;
assets and liabi ities as detai ed below. mplementat on of the matchedofunding policy is a two-step process: funds are earmarked at Board approval stage and&#13;
matched, with respect to nterest rate and currency, at disbursement. This policy limits the Corporation's exposure to unmatched interest rate and exchange risks.&#13;
Liquid asset investment activities&#13;
As noted above, the P1 and P3 portfolios have been generally invested, directly or synthetically, in floating-rate US dollar instruments. This reflects the&#13;
Corporaton's matched-funding policy, which requires that al loans be fu.nded with liabilities bearing similar interest rate and currency characteristics, and the&#13;
tact that its loans are predominantly denominated in floating-rate US dollars&#13;
Beginning in FY01, the Corporation began to manage interest rate risk in the Pt portfol o on a portfolio basis by investing in fixed- or float ng-rate instruments&#13;
against a standard benchmark within specified risk parameters.&#13;
The P2 portfolio is invested in fixed-rate US dollar-denominated instruments. Un lke the PI portfolio, which accepts mostly credit risk, the P2 portfolio incurs&#13;
mainly market risk, with addit onal flexibil ty to deviate from its duration benchmark. The PO portfolio is generally Invested in short-dated deposits reflect ng its&#13;
use for short-term funding requirements.&#13;
IFC uses a variety of derivative instruments in its liquid asset management activities to manage the interest rate, currency, and other market risks&#13;
associated with certain of its liquid asset portfolios consistent w th the Corporation's matched-funding policy. The derivative instruments used include short-term,&#13;
over the-counter fore gn exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate ano currency swaps. and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options&#13;
Borrowing activities&#13;
The Corporation issues debt securtes in various capital markets in a variety of currenc es, sometimes using com plex structures. These structures include&#13;
borrowings payable in mult ple currencies, or borrow ngs with princ pal and/or interest determmed by reference ,o a specitied index such as a stock market&#13;
index, a reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. Market risk associated with fixed-rate obl gations and structured&#13;
instruments iS mitigated by using derivative instruments to convert them  nto variable-rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the Corporation's matched-&#13;
funding policy.&#13;
Lending activities&#13;
Currency and interest rate swaps are used n connection with the Corporation s lend ng activities to minimize the level oi interest rate and currency exchange&#13;
risk In f xed- or floatng-rate non-US dollar or fixed rate US dol ar lending.&#13;
Client risk management activities&#13;
The Corporat on offers risk management products to its clients and seeks to minimize its exposure to market risk resulting from derivative asset and liabdilty&#13;
management transactons with clients by entering into offsetting positions with h ghly rated market counterparties.&#13;
Asset and liability management activities&#13;
Wh le IFC's matched-funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate risk, the Corporation can be exposed to&#13;
residual market risk in Its overall asset and liability management, which is monitored by the Asset-Liability Management group within the Corporation's&#13;
Treasury Department.&#13;
The Corporation may be exposed to residual currency risk due to events such as changes in ihe level of non-US dollar loan loss reserves which it manages&#13;
by monitoring the aggregate pos tion in each lend ng currency and hedging the exposure when the net asset or liability position exceeds $5 million equivalent&#13;
($1 million at June 30, 2000) through spot sales or purchases.&#13;
IFC also faces residual interest rate risk from two sources-&#13;
* Assets that are fully match-tunded at inception can become mismatched over time due to wrntedowns, prepayments, or reschedulicg.&#13;
* LIBOR reset dates on assets can d ffer from those on liabilities (this risk, however, iS limited by synchronizing reset dates on assets and I abil ties at a&#13;
portfolio level).&#13;
This residual interest rate risk is managed by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point&#13;
change in interest rates, with a review trigger of $50,000 on this measure.&#13;
it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MANAGING CREDIT RISK&#13;
Loans and equity investments&#13;
The risk of borrower default in connection with the Corporation's loans and equity investments is discussed above, under Managing Commercial (Project) Rise.&#13;
Treasury counterparty credit risk&#13;
Counterparty credit risk is the principal residual risk to the Corporation arising from its liquid assets and borrowing activities. IFC's credit policies set conservatfie&#13;
eligibility criteria for counterparties and diversification caps on exposure to individual counterparties. IFC currently restricts counterparty eligibility to banks ar d&#13;
financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of A by leading international credit rating agencies. In order to limit exposure to counterparties, IFC sigrs&#13;
collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of collateral when net exposure exceeds certain predetermined thresholds, which decrease as&#13;
a counterparty's credit rating deteriorates. Because counterparties can be downgraded during the life of a transaction, the agreements provide an option for IF,C&#13;
to terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded below investment grade.&#13;
Limits are also imposed on the volume of over-the-counter derivative transactions with individual counterparties. IFC measures derivatives exposure to&#13;
counterparties in terms of "worst case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables which are updated monthly to reflect market movements.&#13;
These restrictions and limits are revised annually at the beginning of each fiscal year and approved by IFC's Finance and Risk Committee. During the year&#13;
institution-speciftic limits are updated monthly based on changes in counterparty size or credit status. For exchange-traded instruments, IFC limits credit risk tv&#13;
restrictingtransactions toa list of authorized excnanges, contracts, and dealers, and by placing limits on the Corporation's open interest rate position in each contract.&#13;
Credit risks arising in connection with IFC's treasury activities are monitored and controlled in accordance with credit risk guidelines established by the&#13;
Corporation's Risk Management Group.&#13;
Client risk management activities&#13;
The Corporation minimizes its credit risk exposure to clients with which it transacts derivative asset and liability management business by conducting cred I&#13;
appraisals of the clients.&#13;
MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK&#13;
Operatonal risk is concerned with the risk to an organization's performance due to how it is operatedas opposed to how it is financed.: IFC has extended this&#13;
definition of operational risk to be the potential for losses arising from internal activities or external events caused by breakdowns in information systems.&#13;
communications, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, and the execution of legal, fiduciary, and agency responsibilities&#13;
Like all financial institutions, IFC is exposed to many types of operational risks. It seeks to mitigate such risks by maintaining a comprehensve system or&#13;
internal controls that is designed not only to identify the parameters of various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of particular concern. The&#13;
Corporation has adopted the COSO' control framework and a control self-assessment methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls, and it&#13;
has an ongoing program in place to cover all significant business operations. In each of the last six fiscal years, IFC has obtained an attestation report from its&#13;
externai auditors on its assertion that as of June 30 of each of the fiscal years, its system of internal control over externa financial reporting met the criteria for&#13;
effective internal control described in COSO and that the Corporation's assertion is fairly stated in all material respects.&#13;
During FY01 several ongoing initiatives emphasized the area of operational risk management, including those described below:&#13;
1. IFC has established an Operational Risk Management (CRM) Sounding Board, and identified a framework for the prioritized review of key ORM components as&#13;
part of IFC's implementation of the COSO methodology in FYOI.&#13;
2. IFC launched its first online version of IFC's Operating Policies, Practices, and Guiding Principles integrated with a revised version of IFC's Operational&#13;
Procedures so that staff can consult the latest comprehensive version easily.&#13;
3. IFC is using the COBIT9 methodology to supplement the COSO review of the information technology function-deemed a high-priority operational risk by the&#13;
ORM Sounding Board.&#13;
4. IFC is reducing its dependence upon isolated information repositories by virtue of the design, development, and implementation of the Information Pyramid&#13;
set of system streams, with the underlying objective of minimum redundant data and a sangle corporate repository of operational and financial data that is&#13;
consistent, comprehensive, and timely. This is supplemented by a Data Stabilization initiative and other data integrity efforts.&#13;
5. IFC and other international financial institutions have established an Investments Impediments Database which is now available to all staff at IFC for use to&#13;
help identify potential project risks.&#13;
6. IFC's Environmentai and Social Risk Rating framework in the Project Supervision Report (PSR) and Credit Risk Rating provides an indication of the current&#13;
level of environmental and social risk associated with a portfolio project. The PSR now has an automatic link to the Legal Agreements Database managed&#13;
by the Legal Department.&#13;
7. Inoependent reviews of the financial, administrative, and organizational structure of several IFC project development facilities have resulted in improved controls,&#13;
information flows, and donor reporting.&#13;
8. Monthly closing procedures have been formalized across departmental lines to minimize information flow breaks and ensure timeliness of financial reporting,&#13;
witn ex post exception reviews conducted as a further control.&#13;
9. The enterprisewide system has been strengthened for IFC through system enhancements, upgrading staff skills through training, and stricter recruitment&#13;
criteria. This has led to improved control over financial accounting and administrative expense processing including budget, expense, travel, procurement,&#13;
and leave and absence attendance administration.&#13;
10. Streamlined equity sale procedures have oeen formulated by the Portfolio Management Department and will be implemented in early FY02 by the central&#13;
Equity Management Desk.&#13;

ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION IN EUROPE&#13;
Since January 1, 1999, in the normal course of business as a muiticurrency organization, i0C has been conducting euro-denominated transactions in paying and&#13;
receiving, liquid asset investments, and debt issuance and in its loan and equity investment portfolio activities. IFC adopted a gradual approach to redenominating&#13;
national currency balance sheet items to the euro during the transition period and expects to complete the redenomination by December 31, 2001 The&#13;
incremental cost of euro conversion is immaterial to the Corporation's financial statements and has been included in the Corporation's administrative expenses.&#13;
VI. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#13;
OVERVIEW&#13;
The main elements of IFC's net income, and influences on the level and variability of operating and net income from year-to-year, are:&#13;
Elements                                           Significant influences&#13;
Operating income:&#13;
Spread on interest-earning assets                  Nonaccruals and the interest ccilection rate on loan interest income&#13;
Trading gains (losses)                             Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the liquid asset portfolios&#13;
Income from the equity investment portfolio        Performance of the equity portfolio (dividends and capital gains)&#13;
Provisions for losses on loans,                    Level of provisions for losses on loans and equity investments and, beginning in FY01, on guarantees&#13;
equity investments, and guarantees&#13;
Noninterest income and expense                     Level of technical assistance and advisory services provided by the Corporation to its cients, the level&#13;
of income from the staff retirement and other benefts plans, and the approved administrative and&#13;
other budgets&#13;
Net income:&#13;
Other unrealized gains and                         Principally, differences between changes in fa.r value of derivative instruments and changes in fair&#13;
losses on financial instruments                    value of hedged items in fair value hedging relationships&#13;
In addition, the Corporation's FY01 net income reflects the one-time Impact of adopting SFAS No. 133.&#13;
The following paragraphs detai significant variances between FY01 and FY00, and FY00 and FY99, covering the periods included in the Corporation's FY01&#13;
financial statements.&#13;
FY01 VERSUS FY00&#13;
Operating income&#13;
The Corporation's operating income for FY01 was $241 million, substantially lower than FYO0's operating income of $380 million. FY01 operating income, unlike&#13;
prior years, reflects unrealized gains and losses on the P1 and P2 liqu d asset portfolios due to the change in classification of these portfolios from available for&#13;
sale to trading on July 1, 2000. The deciine was mainly attributable to significant provisicns for losses on loans, equity investments, and guarantees, reflecting&#13;
the downturn in portfolio quality in FY01. In addition, due to the tough economic conditions in the markets in which IFC operates, realized capital gains were&#13;
significantly lower in FY01 than in FY00. Offsetting these negative factors were strong realized and unrealized gains on the Corporation's liquid asset trading&#13;
activities, which benefited considerably from the recent declining interest rate environment.&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
PFC's primary interest-earning assets are Its loan portfolio ard its liquid assets portfolios. After charges on borrowings are taken into account, net interest income&#13;
improved by $28 million or 5°. from $516 million in FY00 to $544 million in FY01.&#13;
Interest and financial fees for FY01 were $715 miilion, compared with $694 million for FY00, an increase of 3%. The disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio&#13;
declined marginally by 1%, and the Corporation's irterest collecton rate was lower in FY01 than in FY00. Loans in nonaccrual status grew from $922 million at&#13;
June 30, 2000, to $1,054 milion at June 30. 2001, an increase of 14%.&#13;
Interest income from time deposits and securities for FY01 was $790 milion, $156 milion higher than the $634 million recorded in FY00. The liquid assets&#13;
portfol o. net cf derivatives and securities iending activities, grew from $12.2 billion at June 30, 2000, to $13.3 bilihon, largely funded by the growth in the Corporation's&#13;
borrowings program and the slower pace of loan and equity disbursements experienced in FY01. The $1.1 billion growth :n the portfol.o offset the negative effect of&#13;
the declining interest rate environment experienced throughout much of FY01 on interest income from time deposits and securities.&#13;
The Corporation's charges on borrowings grew by $149 milion during FY01 from $812 million to $961 million, largely reflecting the growth of the borrowings&#13;
portfolio, offset by the effect of the decliring interest rate environment. After the effect of associated derivative financial instruments, the borrowings portfolio grew&#13;
by $0.8 billion in FY01, from $15.8 billion at June 30, 2000, to $16.6 biliion at June 30, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
As previously noted, up to and including FY00, unreaiized gains and losses on the Corporation's P1 and P2 liquid assets portfolios were exciuded from net income&#13;
until realized. Effective July 1, 2000, the Corporation reclassified these portfoios from avalable for sale to tradig, and now the Corporation reflects unrealized gains&#13;
and losses on these pornfolios in net income.&#13;
Due tc the declining interest rate environment in FY01, and the favora ble impact of this on the carrying value of the Corporation's fixed-income liquid ass-t&#13;
investments. the Corporation recorded net unrealized gains on its liquid asset pontfolios of $87 mi lion.&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Overall income from the equity investment portfolio declined by $40 mill on, or 15%, from $262 million in FY00 to $222 million in FY01.&#13;
The Corporation generated capital gains for FY01 of $91 million as compared with $132 million for FY00, a deci ne of 31%. Div dend income, however, we:,&#13;
substantially unchanged at $131 million for FYC1 as compared with $130 million for FY00. Consistent with FY00, the stable performance n dividend incom-&#13;
in FY01 was largeiy attributable to toe continuing high level of oi. prices during much of FY01, which significantly .mproved returns on the Corporation's joir I&#13;
ventures in oil, gas, and mining.&#13;
Provisions for losses on loans, equity investments, and guarantees&#13;
The income charge for provisions for losses of $402 million in FY01, which included $13 million in respect of guarantees, was significantly higher than the chargn&#13;
in FY00 of $215 mi lion, a growth of $187 million or 87%. On June 30, 2001, the Corporation's total reserves against losses on loans and equity investmentr&#13;
were 20.3% of the disbursed and outstanding portfolio (18.0% at June 30, 2000).&#13;
Noninterest income&#13;
Noninterest income of $121 million for FY01 was $6 million lower than in FY00 ($127 million), principally due to the sale of assets, inc ud ng assets associatec.&#13;
with the Corporat on's nformation provision business in FY00 that did not recur in FY01. Service fees were also lower at $41 million for FY01 as compared with&#13;
$49 million for FY00.&#13;
Offseting these negative factors was an increase in net periodic pension income from the Staff Retirement Plan and from the change in the Corporation's&#13;
share of net assets held for postretirement benefits. from $47 milion in FYOO to $52 million in FY01.&#13;
Noninterest expense&#13;
Administrative expenses (the pr ncipal component of noninterest expense) rose 16% from $267 mill on in FY00 to $309 million in FY01. Th s increase was in&#13;
line with budget funding of the anticipated growth in the investment portfolio and tre continuing move into smaller investments in frontier countries within&#13;
IFC's portfolio.&#13;
Net income and the impact of new accounting standards&#13;
As more fully disclosed in Notes A, L, and M to the Corporation's FY01 financial statements, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for derivative&#13;
instruments to conform with SFAS No. 133. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the Corporation has designated certain hedging relatonships in its borrowing activities&#13;
and its lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial&#13;
instrumen+s hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, differing valuation methodologies are appiied&#13;
to the derivative and the hedged financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded&#13;
in other unreal zed gains on financial instruments in net income.&#13;
The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income for the year ended June 30, 2001, can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
Operating income                                                    241&#13;
SFAS No. 133 adjustments:&#13;
Other un'ealized gains on financial nstruments                      11&#13;
Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle                 93&#13;
Net income                                                          345&#13;
The cumulat ve effect of the change in accounting principle (the transition adjustment) comprises the difference between the previous ba ance sheet carrying&#13;
value and the fair value of all freestanding derivatives together with the offsetting gains and losses on assets and liabilities held under hedging relationships in&#13;
existence prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133.&#13;
Other unrealized gains and losses on f nancial instruments argely comprise the difference between the change in fair value of derivative instruments and&#13;
the change in fair vailje of the hedged item under designated hedging relationships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FYOO VERSUS FY99&#13;
Net income&#13;
The Corporation's net income for FYOO was $380 million, substantially higher than FY99's net income of $249 million. Several components of net ircome varied&#13;
sigriif cant y in FYOO as compared with I Y99 although the majority ot the mproved performance was a result of a more stable investment portfolio qual ty, which&#13;
resulted in lower provisions for losses in FYOO ($215 mill on) compared with FY99 ($333 mill on).&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFC's primary interest-earning assets are its loan portfolio and ts liquid assets portfol os. After charges on borrowings are taken nto account, net interest income&#13;
Improveo by $32 milihon or 7'%, from $484 milion In FY99 to $516 millon in FYOO&#13;
Interest and financial fees for FYOO were $694 mil ion, compared with $607 mill on for FY99, an increase of 14%. The disbursed and outstand ng loan&#13;
portfolio grew by 7%/C, the Corporation's interest col ection rate was margina ly higher in FYOO than in FY99. and the nterest rate envircnment in general was&#13;
higher during FYOO than in FY99. Offsetting these posit ve effects on interest and financ a fees, loans in nonaccrua status grew from $857 mil ion at J.une 30,&#13;
1999, to $922 mililon at June 30, 2000, an increase of 8%.&#13;
Interest income from time deposits and secur ties for FYOO was $634 million, $87 mi lion h gher than the $547 milion recorded n FY99. 1 he liquid assets&#13;
portfolios, net of der vatives and securities lend ng act vities, grew from $10.1 billion to $12.2 b Ilion largely funded by the growth In the Corporation's&#13;
borrowings program&#13;
The $2.1 bilion growth in the I quid assets portfolios, comained with the overal higher interest rate environment, resulted n an $86 million ncrease in nterest&#13;
income in the PF and P2 portfol os (classifed as availab e for sale) As part of its management of the P2 portfo io, IFO periodically buys newer issue US Treasury&#13;
bonds funded through the sale of older, less liquid securit es. Due to the ris ng interest rate env ronment is FYOO arnd FY99, losses were realized on sales of&#13;
securibts in tie Pt and P2 portfolios undeotaken in both years In FY00, such realized losses on fie P1 and P2 portfolios were $42 militon compared with $22&#13;
million in FY99 Income on the P3 ponrfo io (classified as trading) declined hy $2 mill on n FYO0 Thn dec line was attr huts ble to the heavy volatility of bnnd markets,&#13;
the lattening of the US yield curve, and the consequent widen ng of swap spreads, which particularly h t IFC's portfolio of asset-backed securit es.&#13;
The Corporation's charges on borrovwings rose by $142 mi lion during FYOO from $670 million to $812 million reflecting the growth of the borrow ngs&#13;
portfolio and the rising interest rate environment After the effect of associated derivative financial instruments, the borrowings portfolio grew by $2.6 bilijon in&#13;
FYOO from $13 2 bilion at June 30, 1999, to $15.8 billion&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Overa I ncore from the equity investment portfolio declined marginal y by $3 million, or 1%, from $265 mi lion in FY99 to $262 mil ion n FYOO.&#13;
The Corporation generated capital ga ns for FYOO of $132 million as compared w th $166 m Ilion for FY99, a declone of 20% During the ear y part of FY98,&#13;
IFC was able to liquidate a number of ndiv dual equ ty nvestment holdings to realize capital gains due to a relatively strong environment In the emerging markets&#13;
Stibseqsent to various crises in late FY93 and early FY99, this trend did not confinejp and led to the decine in reali7ed rapital gains in FY99 and into FYOO&#13;
Dividend income, however, rose to $130 million for FYOO as compared with $99 m Ilion for FY99. The growth in d vidend income was largely attributable to&#13;
the growfh in oil pr ces during FYOO, wh oh significantly improved returns on the Corporation's loint ventures in oil, gas, and m ning.&#13;
Provisions for losses on investments&#13;
The income charge for provis ons far losses of $216 millinn in FYOO was significantly lower than thn charge in FY99 af $333 mi ion, a decline of $1 13 m Ilion or&#13;
35%. On June 30, 2000, the Corporation's total reserves aga nst losses on loans and equity investments were 18.0% of the d sbursed and outstand ng portfolio&#13;
(18.2% at June 30, 1999). Provisions were lower in FYOO because impairment was less severe than in FY99, reflecting a rears stable portfolio quality.&#13;
Noninterest income&#13;
Noninterest income of $1 97 million for FYOO was $17 milion higher than FY99 ($1 tO million), principally duje to the vale af assets, inc tiding assets assoc ated&#13;
with the Corporation's Information provision business. Service fees were also higher at $49 million for FYOO as compared with $33 million for FY99.&#13;
Offsett ng these factors was a decrease in net periodic pension income from the Staff Retirement Plan and from the change in the Corporat on's share of&#13;
net assets he d for postretirement benef ts, from $64 million in FY99 to $47 mil on in FYOO.&#13;
Noninterest expense&#13;
Admin strative expenses (the pr ncipal component of noninterest expense) rose 3% from $258 million in FY99 to $267 mi lion n FYOO. This increase was in&#13;
ice w th budget funding of the anticipated growth in the investment portfol o and the cont numng move into smaller investments i frontier countries within&#13;
IFC's portfolio.&#13;

International Finance Corporation&#13;
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the International Finance Corporation, as of June&#13;
30, 2001 and 2000, including the statements of capital stock and voting power, as of June 30, 2001, and&#13;
the related statements of income, comnprehensive income, changes in capital and cash flows for each of&#13;
the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility&#13;
of the Intemational Finance Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on&#13;
these financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America and Intemational Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the&#13;
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material&#13;
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and&#13;
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used&#13;
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of&#13;
the International Finance Corporation as of June 30, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and&#13;
its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2001 in conformity with&#13;
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and also as of June 30, 2000&#13;
and for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2000 in conformity with International&#13;
Accounting Standards.&#13;
As discussed in Notes A, L and M to the financial statements, the International Finance Corporation&#13;
changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments to conform with Statement of Accounting&#13;
Standards (SFAS) No. 133 Accountingfor Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by&#13;
SFAS No. 137, Accountingfor Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective&#13;
Date of FASB Statement No. 133, and SFAS No. 138, Accountingfor Certain Derivative Instruments and&#13;
Certain Hedging Activities.&#13;
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States vary in certain significant respects from&#13;
International Accounting Standards. The application of the latter would have affected the determination&#13;
of net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 and the deterntination of the total assets and capital&#13;
at June 30, 2001 to the extent summanized in Note T.&#13;

markets. The Corporation also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project finding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or&#13;
through loan syndications, underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project finance and resource mobilization, the Corporation offers an array of financial&#13;
and technical advisory services to private businesses in the developing world to increase their chances of success. It also advises governments on how to create&#13;
an environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign investment.&#13;
Note A-Summary of significant accounting and related policies&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP).&#13;
The Corporation has traditionally prepared one set of financial statements and footnotes, complying with both US GAAP and International Accounting&#13;
Standards (IAS). However, due to the promulgation of US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments&#13;
and HedgingAcftivties, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Certain Hedging Relationships (collectively SFAS No. 133), it is&#13;
no longer possible for the Corporation to satisfy the requirements of both US GAAP and IAS via one set of financial statements. The Corporation presents in&#13;
note T a balance sheet and income statement conforming with IAS, together with a reconciliation between US GAAP and IAS.&#13;
Financial statements presentation-Certain amounts in the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.&#13;
As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on July 1, 2000. in respect of loans, borrowings and derivative assets and liabilities, the balance sheet and&#13;
related footnote disclosures as of June 30. 2001 are not comparable with the balance sheet and related footnote disclosures as of June 30, 2000.&#13;
Use of estimates-The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts&#13;
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense&#13;
duringthe reporting period. Actual results could differfrom these estimates. Asignificant degree of judgment has been used in the determination of: the adequacy&#13;
of the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments; estimated fair values of all derivative instruments and related financial instruments in qualifying&#13;
hedging relationships: and net periodic pension income. There are inherent risks and uncertaint es related to the Corporation's operations. The possibility exists&#13;
that changing economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.&#13;
Translation of currencies-Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity investments, are&#13;
expressed in US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000. Disbursed equity investments are expressed in US dollars at&#13;
the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevaiiing at the time of the&#13;
transaction. Translation gains and losses are credited or charged to income.&#13;
Loans and equity investments-Loans and equity investments are recorded as assets when disbursed Loans are carred at the principal amounts outstanding.&#13;
In addition, beginning July 1,2000, where loans are part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying value is adjusted&#13;
for changes in fair value attnibutable to the risk being hedged. These adjustments are reported in other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments&#13;
in net income. It is the Corporation's practice to obtain collateral security such as. but not limited to, mortgages and third-party guarantees. Equity investments&#13;
are carried at cost. On occasion the Corporation enters into put and call option agreements in connection with equity investments&#13;
Reserve against losses for loans and equity investments-The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it&#13;
is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. The reserve against losses for impaired&#13;
loans represents management's judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The Corporation&#13;
establishes a reserve against losses for equity investments when a decrease in value of the investments has occurred which is considered other than&#13;
temporary. The reserve against losses for boans and equity Investments includes an estimate of probable losses on loans and equity investments inherent in&#13;
the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The reserve is established through annual charges to income in the form of a provision for osses on loans and&#13;
equity investments. Investments written off, as well as any subsequent recoveres, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
Revenue recognition on loans and equity investments-Interest income and commitment fees on loans are recorded as income on an accrual basis. All other&#13;
fees are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies. The Corporation does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is n doubt&#13;
or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the near future. Any&#13;
interest accrued on a loan placed n nonaccrual status is reversed out of income and Is thereafter recognized as tncome only when the actual payment is received.&#13;
Interest not previously recognized but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred income and credited to income only when the related&#13;
principal is received.&#13;
Dividends and profit participations are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies. Capital gains on the sale of equity investments&#13;
are measured against the average cost of the investments sold and are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
Guarantees-The Corporation extends guarantee facilities to its clients to provide credit enhancement for their debt securities and trade obigations Under&#13;
the terms of the guarantees, the Corporation agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client. Guarantees&#13;
are regarded as outstanding when the underlying financial obligation of the client is incurred, and called when the Corporation's obligaton under&#13;
the guarantee has been invoked. Guarantees remain off-balance sheet while outstanding; when called, the amount disbursed is recorded as a new loan A&#13;
contingent liability s established for probable losses on outstanding guarantees and is included in payables and other liabilities on the balance sheet. Specific&#13;
reserves are established on called guarantees and are incuded in the reserve against losses on loans and equity investments on the balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio-The Corporation's liquid funds are invested in government and agency obligations, time deposits and asset-backed securities.&#13;
Government and agency obligations include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by&#13;
governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies and instrumentalities or by multilateral organizations. The liquid asset&#13;
porttolio, as defined by the Corporation and as detailed in note B, comprises: these time deposits and securities; related derivative instruments; securities&#13;
purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements and payable for cash collateral received; receivables from sales of&#13;
securities and payables for purchases of securities; and related accrued income and charges.&#13;
On July 1, 2000, the Corporation reclassified all of its available for sale securities as trading securities. This resulted in a transfer of accumulated net&#13;
unrealized holding losses on available for sale securities of $5 million from other comprehensive income to net income in the year ended June30, 2001. Beginning&#13;
with the year ended June 30, 2001, realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are reported separately in the income statement.&#13;
Trading securities are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in net gains and losses on trading activities. Interest on securities and&#13;
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in interest from time deposits and securities.&#13;
The Corporation classifies due from banks, time deposits and securities (collectively, cash and cash equivalents) as an element of liquidity in the&#13;
statement of cash flows because of their nature and the Corporation's policies governing the level and use of such investments.&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements-Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously agrees to repurchase&#13;
the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party purchases securities and simultaneously&#13;
agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price.&#13;
It is the Corporation's policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily liquid government securities. The&#13;
market va ue of these securities is monitored and, within parameters defined in the agreements, additional collateral is obtained when their value declines.&#13;
The Corporation also monitors its exposure with respect to securities sold under repurchase agreements and, in accordance with the terms of the agreements,&#13;
requests the return of excess securities held by the counterparty when their value increases.&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at which the securities were&#13;
acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities payable&#13;
for cash collateral received are recorded at fair value.&#13;
Borrowings-To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, the Corporation borrows in a variety of currencies and uses a number of borrowing&#13;
structures, including foreign exchange rate-linked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, the Corporation simultaneously converts such&#13;
borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap transactions. Under certain outstanding borrowing&#13;
agreements, the Corporation is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than purchase money security interests) without&#13;
extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
Borrowings are recorded at the amount repayabe at maturity, adjusted for unamortized premium and unaccreted discount. In addition, beginning July&#13;
1, 2000, where borrowings are part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying amount is adjusted for changes in fair&#13;
value attributable to the risk being hedged. Adjustments for changes in fair value attributable to hedged risks are reported in other unrealized gains and losses&#13;
on financial instruments. Interest on borrowings and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in charges on borrowings.&#13;
Risk management, derivative instruments and hedge accounting-The Corporation enters into transactions in various derivative instruments for risk&#13;
management purposes in connection with its principal business activities, including lending, client risk management, borrowing, liquid asset portfolio&#13;
management and asset and liability management. The Corporation does not use derivatives for speculative, marketing or merchandising purposes.&#13;
Beginning July 1, 2000, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivative&#13;
instruments embedded in market borrowing transactions entered into on or after January 1, 1999 are bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at fair&#13;
value as derivative assets and liabilities. The value at inception of these embedded derivatives is excluded from the carrying value of market borrowings on&#13;
the balance sheet. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are recorded in net gains and losses&#13;
on tradingactivities. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments otherthan those used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are recorded in other&#13;
unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments. Prior to July 1, 2000, changes in fair values of derivative instruments associated with the liquid asset&#13;
portfolio classified as available for sale were included in other comprehensive income until realized, and those associated with the liquid asset portfolio&#13;
classified as trading were included in net income; other derivative instruments were recorded on the balance sheet at amortized cost.&#13;
Subject to certain specific qualifying conditions in SFAS No. 133, a derivative instrument may be designated either as a hedge of the fair value of an asset&#13;
or liability (fair value hedge), or as a hedge of the variability of cash flows of an asset or liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge). For a derivative&#13;
instrument qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reported in net income, together with offsetting fair value&#13;
gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument qualifying as a cash flow hedge, fair value gains&#13;
or losses associated with the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive income and released to net income in the period(s) in which the effect on&#13;
net income of the hedged item is recorded. Fair value gains and losses on a derivative instrument not qualifying as a hedge are reported in net income.&#13;
The Corporation has designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing and lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation generally matches&#13;
the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest&#13;
rates and other features. However, the valuation methodologies applied to the derivative and the hedged financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133,&#13;
may differ The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments in the&#13;
income statement.&#13;
The Corporation, has not designated any hedging relationships as cash flow hedges. Consequently, the change in fair value of the derivatives in cash&#13;
flow-like hedges recorded in net income is not offset by changes in fair value of the related asset or liability.&#13;
The risk management policy for each of the Corporation's principal business activities, and the accounting policies particular to them, are described below.&#13;
Lending activities: To minimize the level of interest rate and currency exchange risk associated with fixed rate US dollar or non-US dollar lending, derivative&#13;
instruments with generally matching terms are used to convert the cash flows from those loans into variable rate US dollars, consistent with the Corporation's&#13;
matched funding policy. The impact on net income of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps qualifying for the short cut method under SFAS No. 133 is&#13;
exactly offset by a corresponding adjustment to the fair value of the related loans. The Corporation has elected not to designate hedging relationships for all&#13;
other lending-related derivatives that do not qualify for the short cut method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)&#13;
Client risk management activities: The Corporation enters into derivatives transactions with its clients to help them hedge their own currency, interest rate or&#13;
commodity risk, which, in turn, improves the overall quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio. To hedge the market risks that arise from these transactions with&#13;
clients, the Corporation enters into offsetting derivative transactions with matching terms with authorized market counterparties. Changes in fair value of all&#13;
derivatives associated with these activities are reflected currently in net income. Though hedge accounting is not applicable to these activities, the matching of&#13;
terms between the offsetting transactions minimizes the impact on net income.&#13;
Borrowingactivities: The Corporation issues debt securities in various capital markets with the objectives of minimizing its borrowing costs, diversifying funding&#13;
sources, and developing member countries' capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable in multiple&#13;
currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index, a reference interest rate, a&#13;
commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. The Corporation uses derivative instruments with matching terms, primarily currency and interest rate&#13;
swaps, to convert such borrowings Into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy. The Corporation has&#13;
designated the majority of derivatives associated with borrowing activities as fair value hedges of the underlying borrowings. There are a small number of cash&#13;
flow-like hedging transactions for which no hedge relationship has been designated.&#13;
Liquid asset porfYolio management activities: 1 he Corooration manages the interest rate, currency and other market risks associated with certam of the time&#13;
deposits and securities in its liquid asset portfolio by entering into derivative transactions to convert the cash flows from those instruments into variable rate US&#13;
dollars, consistent with the Corporation's matched fund ng policy. The derivative instruments used include short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards&#13;
(covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. As the entire liquid asset portfolio is&#13;
classified as a trading portfolio, all securities (including derivatives) are carried at fair value, and no hedging relationships have been designated.&#13;
Asset and liability management: In addition to the risk managed in the context of its business activities detailed above, the Corporation faces residual market&#13;
risk in its overall asset and liability management. Residual currency risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and&#13;
eliminating the net excess asset or liability position through spot sales or purchases. Interest rate risk due to reset date mismatches is reduced by synchronizing&#13;
the reset dates on assets and liabilities and managing overall interest rate risk on an aggregate basis. Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to&#13;
writedowns, prepayments and reschedulings, and res dual reset date mismatches, is monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and&#13;
liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates.&#13;
The Corporation monitors the credit risk associated with these activities by careful assessment and monitoring of prospective and actual clients and&#13;
counterparties. In respect of liquid assets and derivatives transactions, credit risk is managed by establishing exposure limits based on the credit rating and size&#13;
of the indivedual counterparty. In addition, the Corporation has entered into master agreements governing derivative transactions thatcontain close-out and netting&#13;
provisions and collateral arrangements. Under these agreements, if the Corporation's credit exposure to a counterparty, on a mark-to-market basis, exceeds a&#13;
specified level, the counterparty must post collateral to cover the excess, generally in the form of liquid government securities.&#13;
Resource mobilization -The Corporation mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) through loan participations which&#13;
are sold by the Corporation, without recourse, to Participants. These loan participations are administered and serviced by the Corporation on behalf of the&#13;
Participants. The disbursed and outstanding balances of the loan participations are not included in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
Staff Retirement Plan-The World Bank Group has a defined benefit retirement plan (the Plan) covering substantially all of the Corporation's staff. The Plan&#13;
also covers substantially all the staff of IBRD and MIGA. Under the Plan, benefits are based on the years of contnrbutory service and the highest three-year&#13;
average of pensionable remuneration as defined in the Plan, with the staff contributing a fixed percentage of pensionable remuneration and the World Bank&#13;
Group contributing the remainder of the actuarially determined cost of future Plan benefits. The actuarial present values of Plan obligations throughout the fiscal&#13;
year are determined at the beginning of the fiscal year by the Plan's actuary. The Corporation's total contribution to the Plan is based upon the aggregate funding&#13;
method. All contributions to the Plan and all other assets and income held for purposes of the Plan are held separately from the other assets and income of the&#13;
World Bank Group and can be used only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or provided&#13;
for. Plan assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities, with small holdings of cash, real estate and other investments.&#13;
The net periodic pension income or expense al ocated to the Corporation is included in income from (contributions to) Staff Retirement Plan in the&#13;
income statement.&#13;
Other postretirement benefits-Other postretirement benefits are provided for eligible active and retired World Bank Group staff, including those of the&#13;
Corporation, through a Retired Staff Benefits Plan and a Post Employment Benefits Plan.&#13;
Some ofthe assets designated for other postretirerrent benefits meetthe requirements for plan assets prescribed under SFAS No. 106, Employer'sAccounting&#13;
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Other plan assets and liabilties that do not qualify for off-balance sheet accounting are recorded on IBRD's&#13;
balance sheet. The Corporation includes a receivable from IBRD in receivables and other assets relating to its share of these postretirement benefits net assets,&#13;
representing prepaid postretirement benefits costs. Any increase or decrease in the Corporation's share of these net assets is recognized in increase (decrease)&#13;
in share of net assets held for postretirement benefits in the income statement.&#13;
Introduction of the Euro-Effective January 1, 1999 certain member states of the European Union adopted the Euro as their common currency and the European&#13;
Currency Unit was automatically redenominated into the Euro. Amounts stated in Euros appearing herein for both the current and prior periods have been recast&#13;
from the legacy currencies regardless of the timing of the redenomination of the instruments concerned. Recasting has had no impact on the US dollar&#13;
equivalents reported in these financial statements except insofar as, in the footnotes that disclose currency analyses of balance sheet amounts, legacy currency&#13;
items have been aggregated and single Euro amounts are disclosed in their place.&#13;
Accounting and financial reporting developments-The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 133 on July 1, 2000. The effect of adoption is detailed in note L.&#13;
In March 1999, the International Accounting Standards Committee issued IAS No. 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement. Further details&#13;
are given in note T.&#13;
In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and&#13;
Extinguishments of Liabilities SFAS No. 140, which replaces SFAS No. 125, Accountng for Transfers and Servicing of FinancialAssets and Extinguishments&#13;
of Liabilities, provides accounting and reporting standards for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets. The accounting requirements of the Standard&#13;
are effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities after March 31, 2001, and must be applied prospectively. The&#13;
Corporation applied the provisions of SFAS No. 140 beginning April 1, 2001. SFAS No. 140 also requires certain disclosures related to securitization&#13;
transactions, collateral arrangements and repurchase agreements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. These disclosures are given in note B, "Liquid&#13;
asset portfolio." The adoption of SFAS No, 140 did not have a material Impact on the Corporation's financial position or results of operations for the period.&#13;

The liquid asset portfolio is denominated primarily in US dollars; investments in other currencies, net of the effect of associated derivative instruments that&#13;
convert non-US dollar securities into US dollar securities, represent less than 1% of the portfolio at June 30, 2001 (less than 1%-June 30, 2000). The&#13;
annualized rate of return on the trading portfolio during the year ended June 30, 2001, was 7.1% (5.1%-year ended June 30, 2000; 5.6%-year ended&#13;
June 30, 1999). After the effect of associated derivative instruments, the liquid asset portfolio generally reprices within one year.&#13;

1, 2001. Pursuant to these arrangements, $14 million of sulhscroed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2001 ($14 million-june 30, 2000).&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 2001, 624 shares were subscribed by member countries at a par value of $1,000 each (7,773-year ended June 30,&#13;
2000). A total of less than $1 million was paid in on account of subscriptions ($8 million-year ended June 30, 2000).&#13;

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)&#13;
Note L-lmplementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133&#13;
The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 133 on July 1, 2000. The Standard requires all freestanding derivative instruments, and certain derivatives&#13;
embedded in other financia instruments, to be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, at fair value. The Standard is effective for&#13;
all contracts outstanding at June 30, 2000. However, the Standard contains a grandfathering election, under which derivatives embedded in other&#13;
instruments executed prior to January 1, 1999 need not be bifurcated. In prior periods, the Corporation separately reported the gross receivable and&#13;
gross payable amounts of certain freestanding dervatves as assets and liabilities, respectively.&#13;
At the date of initial application of SFAS No. 133, certain items were recorded as a transition adjustment, denoted as the cumulative effec: of a&#13;
change in accounting principle in the income statement The transition adjustment included, f rst, the difference between the prev ous carrying value&#13;
and the fair value of all freestanding derivative instruments. Secondly, it included the offsetting gains and losses on assets and liabilites held under fair&#13;
value-like hedging relationships in existence prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133 that are also recognized by adjusting their carrying value to fair value.&#13;
Finally, the adjustment included the fair value of derivatives embedded in hybrid financal instruments entered into on or after January 1, 1999, where&#13;
they are required to be separated from the r respective host contracts, and also recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The total amount of the&#13;
transition adjustment. recorded on July 1, 2000, was $93 million.&#13;
Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, the Corporation also recorded a gain of $15 mi lion to accumulated other comprehensive income to adjust the&#13;
book value to fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps in cash flow-like hedges. The Corporation elected not to seek hedge accounting for these&#13;
transactions under the Standard and, accordingly, records the cross currency interest rate swaps at fair value, with the change in fair value included&#13;
in quarterly earnings. The gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income upon adoption of the Standard is released into earnings over the&#13;
remaining onginai hedge term. The amount released for the year ended June 30, 2001 was $3 million; the expected release for the year ending&#13;
June 30, 2002 is $3 million.&#13;

Of the total other unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments, unrealized gains of $22 million are attributable to borrowings and related derivatives&#13;
transactions, unrealized losses of $7 million are attributable to loans and related derivatives transactions and unrealized losses of $4 mil ion are&#13;
attributable to client risk management activities.&#13;
Note N-Derivative and other financial instruments&#13;
Many of the Corporation's financial instruments lack a trading market, characterized as exchanges between willing buyers and sellers. Accordingly,&#13;
estimates and present value calculations of future cash flows were used to estimate the fair values. Determining future cash flows for fair value estimation is&#13;
subjective and imprecise, and minor changes in assumptons or methodologies may materially affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting&#13;
from the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values presented does not necessarily reflect the reaiizable values since the Corporation&#13;
generally holds loans, borrowings and other financial instruments to maturity with the aim of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000. In different interest rate environments, fair value&#13;
results can differ significantly, especially for certain fixed rate financial instruments. Reasonable comparability of fair values among financial institutons is not&#13;
I kely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary market prices.&#13;
This lack of objective pricing standards introduces a greater degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore, while&#13;
disclosure of estimated fair values of financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in using these data for ourposes of evaluating the financial&#13;
condition of the Corporation. The fair values of the individual financial instruments do not represent the fair value of the Corporation taken as a whole.&#13;
The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000 are summarized below.&#13;
Liquid assets-The estimated fair value of time deposits and the trading securities portfolio are based on quoted market prices and the present value of&#13;
estimated future cash fiows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
Derivative instruments-Fair values for interest rate and currency swaps were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using&#13;
appropriate discount rates. Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. Fair values for commodity-indexed&#13;
contracts and call options were based on pricing models. Fair value for put warrants was based on quoted market prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Loans and loan commitments-The Corporation, which extends loans to entities operating in the private sector in its developing member countres&#13;
genera Iy has not sold its loans from the portfolio and there is no comparable secondary market. Fair values for fixed rate loans and loan commitments were&#13;
determ ned using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate comprising the fixed rate loan spread plus the year-end estimated cost of funds.&#13;
Since rates on variable rate loans and loan commitments are generally reset on a quarterly or semiannual basis, the carrying value adjusted for credit risk&#13;
was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. The Corporation also holds options to convert loans into equity of certain of its investee&#13;
companies. Fa r values of these conversion options are based on quoted market prices or other calculated values of the underlying equity investment.&#13;
Equity investments-Fair values were determined using market prices where available, put option prces, book values or cost, certain of which were&#13;
discounted based upon management's estimate of net realizable value. Where market prices were not available or alternate valuation techniques were not&#13;
practical, cost was determined to be the best estimate of fair value, Management's estimate of fair value takes into consideration the relative illiquidity and&#13;
volatility, as well as the overall business constraints, in the emerging markets in which the Corporation invests.&#13;
Borrowings-Fair values were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
Estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are summarized below (US$ milions).&#13;

in the local currency of the country. As a matter of policy, the Corporation carries the currency risk of equity investments and quasi-equity investments and&#13;
funds these investments from Its capital and retained earnings.&#13;

Note P-Segment reporting&#13;
For management purposes, the Corporation's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client services segment primarily&#13;
consists of lending and equity investment activities. The treasury services segment consists of the borrowing, lquid asset management, asset and liability&#13;
management and client risk management activities.&#13;
The assessment of segment performance by senior management includes net income for each segment, return on assets, and return on capital&#13;
employed. The Corporation's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and expenses attributable to each segment.&#13;
Consistentwith internal reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment based largely upon personnel costs and segment head counts.&#13;
Transactions between segments are immaterial and, thus, are not a tactor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
The accounting policies of the Corporation's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in note A, "Summary of&#13;
significant accounting and related policies."&#13;
An analysis of the Corporation's major components of income and expense by business segment for the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999&#13;
is given below (US$ millions):&#13;
