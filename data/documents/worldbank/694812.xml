REPUBLIC OF NIGER&#13;
URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Niger is a large landlocked country covering an area of 1.27 million km2, and is 600 km away&#13;
from the closest seashore. The population estimated at 8.7 million in 1994 -- about half of which is less&#13;
than 15 years old -- is growing at about 3.3 percent a year which is above the average for sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa. Social indicators are among the lowest in the Sahelian countries. The human resource base is&#13;
weak, with an adult literacy rate of only 14 percent (9 percent among women) and a primary school&#13;
enrollment ratio of less than 30 percent. Life expectancy at birth is 47 years, one of the lowest on the&#13;
continent and infant, and child mortality rates are high. The natural resource base is fragile due to low&#13;
and irregular rainfall and low and declining soil fertility. As a result, Niger's fast growing population is&#13;
becoming one of the poorest in the world. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) has declined by&#13;
more than 52 percent since 1980, reaching US$176 in 1994. Niger has an open economy, with imports&#13;
and exports exceeding 30 percent of GDP. Strong trade links exist with Nigeria, which exerts&#13;
considerable economic influence through long-standing trading and cultural bonds.&#13;
2.    Besides the weak natural resource base, Niger faces additional constraints in the form of high&#13;
factor costs, overdependence on uranium, a relatively inefficient public sector and a small modem&#13;
private sector. The fall of uranium prices in 1981 has resulted in severe financial imbalances and&#13;
triggered a long-term economic decline. The devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has given&#13;
Niger an opportunity to resume its economic growth. Political instability, however, has prevented the&#13;
country from taking full advantage of the devaluation. Eventually, the Government reached agreement&#13;
with the International Monetary Fund on an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility program in June&#13;
1996. IDA approved a one-tranche adjustment credit on March 20, 1997.&#13;
3.    Poverty remains critical in Niger. 63 percent of Nigeriens (5.3 million people) earn incomes&#13;
below the poverty threshold defined by the Government. About 34 percent (2.8 million people) are&#13;
classified as extremely poor. Urban/rural differentials are stark, with average rural incomes being half&#13;
those in urban areas. The participatory poverty assessment carried out in 1996 (Report no. 15344-NIR,&#13;
June 28, 1996) pictures vividly poverty in Niger:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                             Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(a)    Urban areas: Poverty is hunger. Ownership of goods is a form of safety net rather that&#13;
money. Being employed is what matters. Women earn revenues through petty trade,&#13;
mostly the sale of cooked food. They take care of the family when men lose their jobs.&#13;
Squatting neglected areas saves the cost of renting houses. Recently, the number of&#13;
beggars has increased in Niamey, and "traditional" beggars have been joined by large&#13;
numbers of younger people.&#13;
(b)    Rural areas: Access to land is a major constraint because of the dearth of fertile land and&#13;
competition exists among groups to exploit natural resources. Households exchange&#13;
young children: families with many children send older children to help families who do&#13;
not have enough labor force and receive younger children. Diversification of income&#13;
sources is a necessary strategy because of the climatic risks, but the poor have little&#13;
possibilities available. Migration is a survival strategy, the poor migrate to look for food&#13;
and work within Niger or to neighboring countries. Remittances contribute to the income&#13;
of those in the household who have stayed in their villages. During the dry season,&#13;
Niamey's population is estimated to increase by 100,000 dwellers.&#13;
4.     Putting the country back onto a development path requires the pursuit of the reform agenda,&#13;
including private sector development and restructuring of the public expenditures to improve basic&#13;
education and health services coverage. Government's commitment and action on key reforms, the return&#13;
to political stability and the resumption of donor assistance are critical for the reform program. Sustained&#13;
success depends on continued fiscal discipline and the increase of investments to rekindle growth,&#13;
especially in satisfying in the large needs in social infrastructure. To pursue its reform agenda, Niger&#13;
critically needs to regain donors' confidence through an effective transition to democracy. In reaction to&#13;
a military takeover in late January 1996, several important donors have suspended budgetary aid, causing&#13;
uncertainty for the budget situation and medium-term policy outlook. A Presidential election was held in&#13;
July 1996 and legislative elections in November 24, 1996.&#13;
B. URBAN SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
5.    In February 1996, the Government adopted a policy to decentralize responsibilities to local&#13;
governments. Because of severe budgetary constraints, however, its implementation will require a long&#13;
period of time. As a first step, the Government has decided to strengthen the capacity of the 15 most&#13;
important urban communities, including Niamey. The Government has prepared an action plan to&#13;
promote the decentralization process and facilitate its implementation. The plan includes training and&#13;
sensitization activities, studies and technical assistance, and seminars (Annex 2). Its objectives are:&#13;
(a)    decentralization: (i) achieve a national consensus on the restructuring of the territorial&#13;
administration; (ii) strengthen the institutional and operational capacity of local&#13;
governments; (iii) put in place the local governments after their election; (iv) implement&#13;
financial mechanisms to provide resources to local governments; (v) strengthen the&#13;
capacity of staff in local governments; and&#13;
(b)    administrative reform and human resource management: (i) define a strategy to reform&#13;
the administration and an action plan to implement the reform; (ii) strengthen the&#13;
capacity of managerial staff in the territorial administration to improve the efficiency of&#13;
the administration; (iii) train and sensitize members of committees for the administrative&#13;
reform; (iv) update the roster of civil servants; (v) define a national policy for human&#13;
resource management.&#13;
&#13;

6.    Municipal elections are envisaged at the end of 1997 or early 1998. They are expected to result&#13;
in more accountability in municipal management and more incentives for the mayors to address urban&#13;
development issues. Conditions for a sustainable development of Nigerien cities have deteriorated in the&#13;
past ten years and rapid urban growth is compounding social problems in cities. This has been caused by&#13;
a decline in the amount of investment in the sector and weakening local governments resulting in poor&#13;
delivery of urban services and insufficient mobilization of resources. Urban development responsibilities&#13;
are centralized and decisions have been taken without consultation with sector stakeholders due to an&#13;
incomplete and imprecise institutional framework and the lack of urban development strategy. The&#13;
spatial organization has resulted from cutting up available space in parcels and juxtaposing housing&#13;
development plans without planning and coordination, integration with the existing urban environment,&#13;
and programming of basic infrastructure. Based on the 1988 census, the urban population would amount&#13;
to 1.75 million inhabitants in 1997, about 21 percent of the total population of Niger. Urban growth has&#13;
averaged 5.5 percent per year since 1988 after an annual 10 percent during the previous decade. The&#13;
capital, with about 600,000 inhabitants represents 35 percent of total urban population.&#13;
7.    Introduction of fundamental reforms in the urban institutional framework is a compelling&#13;
necessity if the challenge of an orderly urban development is to be met in the future. Because of the&#13;
centralized management of the sector, the government has been unable or unwilling to adjust the urban&#13;
framework to the extensive changes that have taken place in the sector during the past twenty years.&#13;
There are no clear criteria to define urban areas. Proper urban authority only exists in 22 municipalities&#13;
comprising urban centers designated as such already in 1964; Diffa, which despite its modest size was&#13;
elevated to the status of a municipality for political reasons in 1986; and a few other cities which have&#13;
received this status, based more on a ad-hoc decision than on a desire expressed by populations or on a&#13;
planning process based on technico-economic criteria. All other centers, whatever their size or economic&#13;
importance, continue to be considered part of rural areas and are administered through institutional&#13;
arrangements and procedures tailored for such areas.&#13;
8.    Central government responsibilities in the management of local governments are in principle&#13;
limited to overseeing and coordination. The central authorities in the urban sector are: (a) the Ministry of&#13;
Interior and Land Development which supervises the functioning of local governments, especially the&#13;
preparation of annual budgets; (b) the Ministry of Finance which assess and collects property taxes and&#13;
business license fees; and (c) the Ministry of Equipment and Infrastructure which participates in the&#13;
preparation of urban development plans, land subdivision and sanitation and housing projects. The&#13;
Ministry of Finance has decentralized actual assessment and collection of fiscal resources to regional&#13;
services. Within the Ministry of Equipment and Infrastructure, the actual implementation of urban&#13;
development plans, the processing of land subdivisions and the control of central government-funded&#13;
investment projects are also decentralized to regional services. However, the decision to prepare a&#13;
development plan is still taken at the central level without much consultation with the local governments.&#13;
9.    The financial situation of urban communes differ significantly depending on their size. Three&#13;
communes show annual operating expenditures above US$1 million equivalent. Five communes have&#13;
operating expenditures ranging between US$1 million and US$200,000. The other 14 remaining&#13;
communes have operating expenditures below US$200,000, averaging US$60,000. In the latter&#13;
communes, expenditures cover mostly operating costs (salaries, reimbursement of the debt). The smallest&#13;
communes are heavily indebted, with the total debt equaling one year of revenues. Larger communes are&#13;
less indebted because of their capacity to invest from their own resources. In 1995, the annual tax&#13;
revenues averaged US$2.1 per inhabitant in the communes other than Niamey. This is less than one&#13;
fourth of the 1984-1985 average revenues per capita for all communes, excluding Niamey. In&#13;
comparison, the average tax revenue in Niamey's communes is about US$7 par capita in 1995. Tax&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4                                             Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
revenues represent between 50 and 100 percent of total revenues. The tax collection rate is a low 60&#13;
percent. Taxes fall into two distinct categories: state taxes levied by the central government and partially&#13;
returned to the local governments, which represent about two third of the total taxes, and local taxes&#13;
directly levied by the local governments. State taxes comprise mostly business taxes and property taxes.&#13;
The transit through central government circuits frequently delays the restitution of taxes to local&#13;
governments and puts the actual availability of funds at random, even more so with the current fiscal&#13;
crisis in the central government.&#13;
10.   Investment expenditures vary widely depending on the year. They range between CFAF 85&#13;
million and CFAF 907 million for the municipality of Niamey, between CFAF 20 million and CFAF 220&#13;
million for the other communes in Niamey, and between 0 and CFAF 200 million with an average of&#13;
CFAF13 million per year for the other Nigerien municipalities. Infrastructure represents more than 85&#13;
percent of expenditures. Social infrastructure is predominant with more than 50 percent of expenditures.&#13;
Economic infrastructure comes in second and administrative infrastructure in third. Revenues are&#13;
generated by the sale of plots, taxes collected on water and electricity bills, which are earmarked for&#13;
water and electricity investment expenditures, and the investment fund, which receives resources from&#13;
the operating budget. Annex 3 provides detailed data on revenues and expenditures of municipalities in&#13;
Niger.&#13;
I1.    The Government has defined a set of basic principles for urban development (Annex 4), which&#13;
focus on:&#13;
(a)   transferring some State responsibilities to the local governments;&#13;
(b)    strengthening the mobilization of local resources with a revised tax system resulting in a&#13;
better recovery of urban development and management costs, a better control of the tax&#13;
base, and a better recovery of taxes;&#13;
(c)    improving the sustainability of development programs through a better adequacy of&#13;
existing or generated revenues to cover investment and recurrent costs;&#13;
(d)    developing a public/private partnership in the implementation of urban development&#13;
plans;&#13;
(e)    strengthening the organizational and conceptual capacity of sector institutions;&#13;
(f)    shifting the role of the State from direct involvement to support to local governments in&#13;
management, planning and programming; and&#13;
(g)    developing simplified tools to be used by local governments to prepare urban&#13;
development plans compatible with their human and financial capacity.&#13;
12.   To overcome the social effects of the economic crisis which has resulted in increased&#13;
unemployment in urban areas, the Government has established with IDA's assistance a framework to&#13;
promote labor-based methods and small and medium enterprises in the execution of small urban civil&#13;
works. This framework was initiated under the Public Works and Employment Project (Cr. 2209-NIR,&#13;
approved in 1991). An autonomous, not-for-profit and independent agency, NIGETIP, was created to&#13;
manage the execution of works programs. Since its creation, NIGETIP has executed a portfolio totaling&#13;
CFAF21 billion. Payment of salaries have totaled CFAF4.3 billion, representing about 23 percent of the&#13;
amount of the works contracts and about two million person-days of employment. NIGETIP has an on-&#13;

going portfolio amounting to CFAF10 billion. Other donors (Caisse Francaise de Developpement,&#13;
European Union, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the OPEC Fund) have used NIGETIP's services.&#13;
NIGETIP has executed sub-projects in several secondary cities. NIGETIP also promotes the use of local&#13;
materials in most of the sub-projects, such as buildings or fences using prestressed banco (dry mud). A&#13;
summary of NIGETIP activities is presented in Annex 5.&#13;
13.   Few urban development projects are included in the Public Investment Program (PIE). They&#13;
consist in a sanitation project financed by the European Union in Agadez, the rehabilitation of old&#13;
suburbs in Niamey financed by the United Nations Development Program which is a follow-up to a&#13;
similar operation completed in 1993, a NIGETIP operation financed by Caisse Francaise de&#13;
Developpement in 11 secondary cities, and the preparation of urban development plans financed by the&#13;
Treasury. Urban development projects in the PIE total about CFAF3 billion during the 1997-1999 period&#13;
representing a low 1 percent of the total PIE. Projects and annual amounts are detailed in Table 1.&#13;

14.   The NIGETIP experience and similar experiences of executing agencies (known as AGETIPs) in&#13;
several sub-Saharan countries (Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Madagascar, Gambia, Benin and&#13;
Mauritania) have demonstrated that the objectives of poverty reduction and management efficiency&#13;
promoted by these agencies have been achieved. The ratio of labor cost versus total cost exceeds 20&#13;
percent, which was the revised targeted ratio after the CFAF devaluation in January 1994. This ratio&#13;
evidences the strong impact on poverty reduction and employment generation. Like similar agencies,&#13;
NIGETIP has proved to be an efficient tool for the management of large number of contracts with short&#13;
payment times to contractors. NIGETIP uses streamlined procedures to speed up project implementation.&#13;
The impact on the construction industry has been significant. In 1996, 222 contracts were awarded to&#13;
small and medium enterprises, 51 contracts awarded to local consulting firms for the engineering studies&#13;
and 198 for the supervision of works. 428 small and medium enterprises and 84 consulting firms had&#13;
been preselected by NIGETIP.&#13;
15.   The portfolio of AGETIP projects in Africa was audited by the Operations Evaluation&#13;
Department of the Bank in 1997. The overall conclusion was that such projects are generally well&#13;
controlled, but there are areas for improvement:&#13;
(a)    The preparation and supervision of the projects are in line with Bank policies and&#13;
generally reflect a more consistent application of promoted "best practices".&#13;
(b)    IDA credit agreements contain appropriate safeguards concerning project staffing and&#13;
administration. However, project supervision should ensure that agencies do not&#13;
substitute borrowed or surplus funds for delayed counterpart funds in order to commence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                             Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
sub-projects in an effort to maintain operating targets. Agency workload and work mix&#13;
need also to be carefully monitored.&#13;
(c)    The projects have good output and efficiency indicators but suffer lack of impact&#13;
measurement. Output indicators focus on quantitative results (completion, timeliness),&#13;
but the quality of works completed should also be considered.&#13;
(d)    The control environment for NIGETIP-type projects promotes responsive, efficient and&#13;
ethical performance. The internal control structure within the agencies generally&#13;
emphasizes transparency and accountability.&#13;
(e)    Procedures for procurement of goods and works stress efficient, effective and transparent&#13;
practices. However, consultant selection could be made more transparent. The process of&#13;
registering consultants and contractors in rosters should be subject to audits.&#13;
(f)    Many aspects of project financial management and auditing reflect good practices.&#13;
Agencies have adequate accounting and operational informnation system but financial&#13;
statements and quality of audits need to be improved. An internal auditing/monitoring&#13;
function is desirable.&#13;
16.   The Public Works and Employment Project in Niger was subject to a technical audit in May&#13;
1995. The mission concluded that the manual of procedures was generally well applied. Project selection,&#13;
procurement of works and payments were transparent and fast. The mission recommended several&#13;
improvements which have been progressively implemented. The quality of the works was found&#13;
satisfactory. Maintenance of infrastructure was generally satisfactory, although maintenance of roads&#13;
built under the project was insufficient.&#13;
17.   Apart the NIGETIP experience, IDA experience in Niger's urban development has been limited&#13;
to the preparation of the first urban project which started in 1990. The project was ambitious and aimed&#13;
at reforming the urban sector institutions in conjunction with the decentralization process which was&#13;
envisaged by the Government, and at addressing urban management issues related to collection of solid&#13;
waste and refusals, traffic plan and urban transport, housing, and urban infrastructure. However, due to&#13;
the slow progress of the Government in taking actions in the areas of decentralization, management of&#13;
local governments, legal status of urban communities, and municipal finances, the preparation of the&#13;
project was canceled in mid-1994 and replaced by the preparation of a more focused Infrastructure&#13;
Rehabilitation Project instead.&#13;
18.   The experience of the urban data bank implemented in Niger with French financing, has&#13;
demonstrated that consultation between the different parties involved is key to improving urban&#13;
development management. The NIGETIP experience as well as the UNDP project to restructure old&#13;
suburbs has led to the same conclusion regarding consultation between the different parties involved in&#13;
maintenance of urban infrastructure.&#13;
D. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
19.   The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by&#13;
the Board on May 9, 1994. The strategy is based on four major building blocks: (a) addressing long-term&#13;
human capital (including poverty alleviation) and natural resource issues; (b) building public and private&#13;
sector institutions to promote private sector based growth; (c) increasing efficiency of public resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                                          7&#13;
management; and (d) supporting actions to facilitate supply response in the wake of the CFAF&#13;
devaluation. The proposed project will contribute to poverty alleviation through employment generation&#13;
in urban areas. It will also contribute to increase efficiency of public resource management by improving&#13;
the use of scarce resources available for urban infrastructure development, by improving the quality of&#13;
preparation of urban projects and focusing on revenue-generating investments, and by using transparent&#13;
procedures and delegation of authority in project execution for urban works. The project will develop the&#13;
use of local contractors and consulting firms in support of the private sector based growth CAS&#13;
objective.&#13;
20.    IDA will have a critical role through its participation in the project in assisting the Government&#13;
and municipalities in establishing a new framework for urban infrastructure development and future&#13;
donor interventions in the sector. No other donors are involved currently in the strengthening of the local&#13;
capacity to manage urban infrastructure development. Caisse Fran,aise de Developpement and GTZ&#13;
have included in their NIGETIP projects under preparation mechanisms to ensure that municipalities&#13;
earmark resources for future investments including the rehabilitation of infrastructure financed under the&#13;
projects. UNDP's assistance aims at creating a sustainable mechanism for financing the rehabilitation of&#13;
old suburbs. Other donors' involvement in the past in the urban sector has been limited mostly either to&#13;
provision of assistance to the central government or to physical works and other activities directly related&#13;
to their project. Little assistance has been provided directly to municipalities until now, this being&#13;
explained by centralized management at the State level and the absence of elected mayors.&#13;
21.    Project activities related to decentralization have been limited to those consistent with the urban&#13;
focus of the project. This is justified by the risk of slow implementation of the overall decentralization&#13;
framework, especially fiscal measures taking into account the scarcity of State revenues and&#13;
consequently the Government reluctance to transfer some of these revenues to the municipalities. To&#13;
help the Government address these issues, the Government is preparing the proposed Public Sector&#13;
Management Project (PSM; FY98), which will provide assistance to the Government to decentralize its&#13;
responsibilities and resources in a coherent macro-economic perspective. The present operation will&#13;
coordinate with the PSM project in this respect.&#13;
11. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
22.    The development objectives are (a) to reduce poverty in urban areas by creating employment; (b)&#13;
to provide municipalities with skills to develop and manage their infrastructure; and (c) to promote local&#13;
engineering firms and contractors, labor-based niethods and local materials.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
23.    The project will include three components:&#13;
(a)    civil works: execution of a program of small urban works; identification of sub-projects&#13;
including  economic/financial  analysis,  environmental  impact  assessment  and&#13;
consultation with beneficiaries; and engineering studies and supervision of works;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                              Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(b)    institutional building: (i) support to municipalities: study to establish simplified tools to&#13;
plan urban infrastructure development; definition of a methodology to help urban&#13;
municipalities to develop a strategy for urban development including provision of urban&#13;
services and mobilization of resources and application to Niamey and one secondary&#13;
city; basic cartography of Niamey and Dogondoutchi; prefeasibility, feasibility and&#13;
preparation of a pilot operation of integrated urban development in association with a&#13;
private property developer; technical assistance and consulting services to assist the&#13;
Government and the municipalities in implementing the studies' recommendations;&#13;
periodic ex-post environmental assessments of NIGETIP projects and establishment of a&#13;
guide for environmental assessment of small urban works including training; definition&#13;
of a methodology for the economic/financial analysis of small urban works; training and&#13;
sensitization of executing agencies to the use of autonomous implementing agencies&#13;
such as NIGETIP; preparation of an urban environment management strategy; assistance&#13;
to define the new legal framework for the communes; revision of the budget structure&#13;
and study of new resources for the urban communes; restructuring study of the urban&#13;
development agency in the Ministry of Equipment and Infrastructure; equipment; and&#13;
(ii) promotion of the private sector: promotion of local materials used in the local&#13;
construction industry; training of local consulting firms and local contractors;&#13;
(c)    project execution: improvement of NIGETIP's management information system; audits&#13;
of the project accounts and NIGETIP; technical audits of biannual works programs&#13;
executed by NIGETIP; incremental operating costs of the project's coordination unit&#13;
(NBC) including local staff under contract; short-term missions of technical assistance;&#13;
provision of an accountant to NBC; and equipment.&#13;
24.   The small urban works component will finance a three-year program  of construction or&#13;
rehabilitation of infrastructure and municipal assets at the request of the promoter-beneficiary&#13;
municipalities. The project will help develop integrated sub-projects including both income-generating&#13;
and non income-generating sub-projects. By improving the physical environment of income-generating&#13;
projects, this approach would increase their attractiveness and profitability. Typical municipal income-&#13;
generating sub-projects include markets, slaughterhouses, parking lots, road stations and public latrines.&#13;
Sub-projects to improve the physical environment of the income-generating sub-projects include road&#13;
paving, sidewalks, drainage. The list of typical sub-projects eligible to project financing is included in&#13;
NIGETIP's Manual of Procedures although it is not a restriction. The ratio of income-generating sub-&#13;
projects versus non income-generating sub-projects will be monitored during project execution. The&#13;
percentage of income-generating sub-projects targeted is 60 percent or above.&#13;
25.    The institutional component is designed to provide tools and skills to municipalities to develop&#13;
urban infrastructure through a mix of activities which have immediate results applicable to the&#13;
preparation of sub-projects financed under the project or will help municipalities to develop a framework&#13;
from which future infrastructure projects will be conceived. Activities such as economic/financial&#13;
analysis, environmental impact assessments and willingness-to-pay surveys will be used to improve the&#13;
quality of projects proposed to IDA financing as well as to build a capacity in the municipalities on&#13;
themes which are necessary to them to develop and apply urban infrastructure development strategy in&#13;
the future. Other activities such as the definition of a methodology to develop urban strategies,&#13;
establishment of simplified planning tools and preparation of an urban environment management&#13;
strategy will provide the capacity to address broader urban development issues that cannot be addressed&#13;
through the small-size sub-projects which are executed under the project.&#13;

26.    Training and sensitization is an important component of the project. Although training was&#13;
provided under the Public Works and Employment Project, it was mostly limited to the Niamey area and&#13;
needs to be extended to secondary cities to broaden the pool of small and medium enterprises. The&#13;
studies listed above will be carried out in a participatory way leading to training. Training will be&#13;
provided in the following fields: environmental issues in urban management, economic/financial analysis&#13;
and environmental impact assessment of sub-projects, use of simplified tools to plan urban infrastructure&#13;
development, methodology to develop a strategy for urban development, supervision of works,&#13;
management of works execution, use of local materials. Training will be aimed at staff in central and&#13;
local governments and municipalities, consulting firms and contractors. The project will include an&#13;
Information, Education, Communication component aimed at beneficiaries to develop their involvement&#13;
in the identification, preparation and operation of sub-projects. A continuous campaign during project&#13;
execution will sensitize municipalities and other potential contracting authorities to the use of&#13;
autonomous implementing agencies. A workshop will be organized to launch the project. Missions will&#13;
be sent to foreign countries to review experiences in the use of simplified tools for planning urban&#13;
infrastructure development. As several training activities will be aimed at the private sector, the&#13;
possibility of full or at least partial cost recovery will be investigated during the preparation of the&#13;
detailed training programs in consultation with the beneficiaries.&#13;
C. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
27.    The total project cost is estimated at US$28 million. IDA's contribution will amount to US$20&#13;
million. Central Government and municipalities will provide counterpart funds equivalent to US$2.2&#13;
million and taxes equivalent to US$2.3 million. The project is exempt of the value-added tax and custom&#13;
duties on imported materials used for the works and equipment imported for NBC and NIGETIP. The&#13;
Government will finance the preparation of urban strategies and infrastructure development plans for one&#13;
secondary city per year starting in 1999 at a cost estimated at US$55,000 per year, and incremental&#13;
operating costs of the project coordination unit, including salaries of civil servants, estimated at about&#13;
US$12,000 per year. Other donors' financing is sought for the equivalent of US$3.5 million including&#13;
indirect taxes. If this financing is not forthcoming, the physical scope of the project will be reduced.&#13;
Table 2 summarizes the distribution of project costs per component and foreign currency, local currency&#13;
and taxes. Project costs are detailed in Annex 6.&#13;

28.    Counterpart funds will be provided in cash or in kind. Counterpart funds provided in cash will be&#13;
deposited in a project account owned by NIGETIP, half before NIGETIP signs the convention with the&#13;
contracting authority and half before NIGETIP contracts out the works. Contribution in kind will consist&#13;
in works executed by force account before NIGETIP signs the convention with the contracting authority.&#13;
Execution of works will be managed by NIGETIP and supervised by independent consulting firms.&#13;
NIGETIP will value the contribution in kind. For the first year of project execution, the Government will&#13;
deposit counterpart funds to the financing of equipment and incremental operating costs, on the project&#13;
account before Credit effectiveness.&#13;

29.    Based on an effectiveness date of August 31, 1997, the project is expected to be completed&#13;
within a five-year period by June 30, 2001 with a closing date of December 28, 2001. Graph I above&#13;
compares expected disbursements to standard disbursement profiles for urban projects in the Africa&#13;
Region, disbursements under the on-going Public Works and Employment Project and under a similar&#13;
operation in Senegal. The highest amount of annual disbursements for works managed by NIGETIP,&#13;
estimated at about US$6 million in 1998 and 1999, represent less than half of the total amount of funds&#13;
managed and disbursed by NIGETIP in 1994, thus far below the absorptive capacity of the agency.&#13;
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
30.    The Prime Ministry will be responsible for the overall coordination of the project through the&#13;
project's Steering Committee. The Steering Committee coordinates both transport (proposed Transport&#13;
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project, FY98) and urban infrastructure rehabilitation projects. It is&#13;
composed of representatives of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Infrastructure&#13;
and Equipment, and the Secretary to Decentralization and Administrative Reform. It consults the&#13;
municipalities with respect to their participation in the project and the National Council of Environment&#13;
for Sustainable Development and the Environment Department in the Ministry of Hydraulics and&#13;
Environment on environmental matters. A sub-committee composed of staff of the Steering Committee&#13;
concerned with the urban project will be responsible for other procurement than that under NIGETIP's&#13;
responsibility (see below). The staff in the Steering Committee will be trained to use Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines as part of the project activities.&#13;
31.    Because of the large number of institutions involved in the urban sector, the National Bureau of&#13;
Coordination (NBC), located in the Prime Ministry, will be responsible for the coordination of technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                                       11&#13;
assistance provided in the institutional development component of the project. NBC has coordinated&#13;
project preparation. NBC's staff consists of one civil servant, who is chief of the Bureau, and one&#13;
accountant under contract. Capacity of the accountant is being verified in conjunction with the&#13;
implementation of the new computerized management information system. NBC's chief has performed&#13;
his duties satisfactorily; he is well accepted by other executing agencies.&#13;
32.   NIGETIP will be executing agency for the civil works component of the project. The Agency&#13;
will be responsible for: (a) the execution of the program of works, including selection of consultants for&#13;
the design of sub-projects and supervision of works, procurement of civil works contractors and&#13;
management of the contracts; and (b) activities to promote the private sector, sensitize contracting&#13;
authorities (municipalities, ministries) and develop participation of beneficiaries. The program of works&#13;
will be defined by the contracting authorities in consultation with beneficiaries. Each contracting&#13;
authority will prepare a short brief for each sub-project, giving a description of the project, its type&#13;
(revenue-earning or non revenue-earning), its cost, its social, economic or financial justification, the type&#13;
of management of the infrastructure (public or private), the amount of revenues expected to be generated&#13;
for the municipality, the impact on the population and the environment, the ratio of salaries and local&#13;
materials versus the total cost of works, the cost of maintenance and the arrangements for maintaining&#13;
the infrastructure, and the arrangements for providing counterpart funds (in cash or in kind). Local&#13;
consultants will assist in the preparation of sub-projects and NIGETIP will review and help finalize&#13;
them. Twice a year, NIGETIP will draw up a list of sub-projects presented by the municipalities after&#13;
having verified their eligibility in accordance with the criteria defined in its Manual of Procedures. The&#13;
portfolio of sub-projects will then be submitted to the Government and to IDA for no-objection.&#13;
Submission of a first portfolio of sub-projects is a condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
33.    The Government and NIGETIP should enter into a General Agreement on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. The General Agreement was agreed during negotiations and should be signed before&#13;
Credit effectiveness. It includes:&#13;
(a)    provisions for the transfer of the proceeds of the Credit on a non-reimbursable basis for&#13;
financing small urban works contracts, contracts with consultants for engineering studies&#13;
and supervision of works, and NIGETIP's management fee;&#13;
(b)   the Manual of Procedures specifying the obligations of NIGETIP related to the execution&#13;
of the Project, selection of sub-projects, procurement and disbursement procedures,&#13;
auditing, accounting and reporting;&#13;
(c)   the obligation of NIGETIP to keep the positions of Director General, Technical Director,&#13;
Financial Director and civil engineers responsible for the management of contracts filled&#13;
by persons having experience and qualifications acceptable to the Government and IDA;&#13;
(d)    a sample of agreement to be entered into between NIGETIP and a contracting authority&#13;
to execute a sub-project; and&#13;
(e)   the obligation of NIGETIP to submit to IDA for its approval not later than June 30 and&#13;
December 31 of each year a program of proposed sub-projects representing an aggregate&#13;
cost of US$17.5 million.&#13;
During negotiations, IDA was satisfied that the General Agreement and the Manual of&#13;
Procedures will ensure the independence of the Agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                            Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
34.    NIGETIP's Manual of Procedures was revised to take into account similar experiences in other&#13;
countries and lessons learned from the NIGETIP experience in Niger. The final manual of procedures&#13;
was agreed during negotiations. Among all the revisions which have been identified, the following are&#13;
the most important: (a) to improve the sub-project briefs; (b) to clarify delays between the approval of a&#13;
sub-project and the start of works to give enough time for the engineering studies and thus improve their&#13;
quality; (c) to improve procedures to award works contracts; (d) to improve the preselection procedure of&#13;
entrepreneurs; (e) to improve the procedure to select consulting firms which carry out studies and&#13;
supervise the execution of works. The Manual includes draft contracts for works, engineering studies and&#13;
supervision of works and standard terms of reference for engineering studies and supervision of works.&#13;
35.   NBC will consolidate project accounting information for activities it is responsible for and for&#13;
activities carried out by NIGETIP. NBC will employ an accountant acceptable to IDA during the project&#13;
life. NIGETIP will employ a Chief Accountant during the project life. Financial responsibilities will be&#13;
carried out on a continuous basis throughout project implementation. NIGETIP management fees will be&#13;
paid upfront on the basis of the works for which NIGETIP is appointed as executing agency. The ratio of&#13;
management fee versus total costs will be monitored during project execution. The Government and&#13;
NIGETIP agreed during negotiations that the targeted ratio is less than 5 percent for works in the&#13;
departments of Tillabery and Dosso and in Niamey, and 7 percent in other departments.&#13;
36.    The Project Implementation Plan was agreed during negotiations. The project implementation&#13;
schedule is presented in Annex 7.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
37.    During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to the procurement procedures described hereafter.&#13;
All goods and works financed under the IDA credit will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines&#13;
for the Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised January 1996 and&#13;
August 1996). Consultants will be selected in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers, and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (January 1997). NCB&#13;
procedures will provide for the following elements: (a) participation of foreign bidders will be permitted;&#13;
(b) evaluation and award criteria will be included in the bidding documents; (c) bidding will be&#13;
advertised locally and bids will be opened in public; and (d) the contract will be awarded to the lowest&#13;
evaluated responsive bidder. Table 3 summarizes the project elements, their estimated cost and&#13;
procurement methods.&#13;
Procurement of Civil Works&#13;
38.    Procedures for procurement of small urban works are detailed in NIGETIP's Manual of&#13;
Procedures. The Manual includes standard bidding documents acceptable to IDA. It is anticipated that&#13;
most contracts will be below CFAF 125 million (about US$ 250,000) and will be procured using national&#13;
competitive bidding (NCB) procedure. In case any contract is higher than this threshold, international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) procedure will be used. As in the Public Works and Employment Project,&#13;
NIGETIP will continue to maintain a roster of entrepreneurs eligible for participation in NCB&#13;
procurement under the project. This roster will remain open during the project so that new candidates can&#13;
be admitted at any time. Eligibility criteria for admission are spelled out in NIGETIP's Manual of&#13;
Procedures. The roster was revised in 1995 after broad advertising. The number of enterprises was&#13;
reduced from 865 to 395 by removing enterprises which were unable to provide the required information&#13;
(categories of works for which the enterprise applies, geographical area in which the enterprise is&#13;
interested, similar references to the types of works in which the enterprise is interested). The roster of&#13;
&#13;

Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                                              13&#13;
contractors was examined by IDA during appraisal and will be examined again at mid-term review to&#13;
ensure that the procedures are in conformity with NIGETIP's Manual of Procedures. The bidding&#13;
procedure will consist of local advertising of a proposed contract for a given sub-project to the&#13;
enterprises listed in the roster. Procurement notices will be published in local newspapers informing&#13;
potential bidders that have not yet asked to be registered by NIGETIP.&#13;

Procurement of Goods&#13;
39.    Goods (cars, computers) estimated to cost less than US$ 50,000 equivalent per contract, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount not to exceed US$ 100,000 equivalent will be procured under contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of NCB, advertised locally, in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA, including: (a) bids&#13;
will be opened in public in the presence of bidders or their representatives; (b) there will be no&#13;
negotiation with bidders between bid opening and contract award; (c) bid evaluation and post-&#13;
qualification criteria will be defined in precise quantitative and monetary terms; and (d) award will be&#13;
made to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.&#13;
Employment of Consultants&#13;
40.    The Borrower agreed during negotiations that qualifications, experience, and terms and&#13;
conditions of employment of consultants shall be satisfactory to IDA. The model contract in NIGETIP's&#13;
Manual of Procedures will be used to contract consulting firms for the engineering design and&#13;
supervision of small urban works. For other consulting services, the model letter of invitation and the&#13;
standard forms of contract issued by the Bank Group shall be used with such modifications as shall have&#13;
been agreed by IDA. Where no relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank&#13;
Group, the Borrower will use other forms agreed with IDA prior to inviting proposals. Consultants for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

identification of sub-projects, engineering studies and supervision of works executed by NIGETIP,&#13;
totaling US$1,800,000 and estimated to cost less than US$25,000 equivalent per contract, cartography of&#13;
two cities (US$116,000) and project audits (US$121,000) will be procured using the least-cost selection&#13;
services method. Would the project coordinator be detached from the administration during project&#13;
execution, its contract (about US$20,000 per year) would be a sole-source contract. Short-term missions&#13;
of technical assistance to follow up on the implementation of studies' recommendations will be procured&#13;
under contracts awarded to individual consultants in accordance with the provisions of the guidelines.&#13;
Other consultants will be selected on the basis of the quality and cost-based selection method. The short-&#13;
lists of consultants for identification of sub-projects, engineering studies and supervision of works&#13;
executed by NIGETIP will comprise entirely national consultants in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
the guidelines.&#13;
Review by IDA of Procurement Decisions&#13;
41.    Prior review by IDA of bid and contract documents will be required for consultant services&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$100,000 equivalent for firms (five contracts) and US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
for individual consultants (two contracts), for civil works contracts above US$ 250,000 equivalent (none&#13;
expected), and for goods contracts above US$50,000 equivalent (one contract). Documentation for&#13;
contracts under these thresholds will be maintained for ex-post reviews by auditors and IDA supervision&#13;
missions. For the selection of consultants, prior review will be required for terms of reference, single-&#13;
source hiring of consulting firms, amendments of contracts raising the contract value above US$100,000&#13;
for firns and US$50,000 for individual consultants. For all civil works contracts for which there are less&#13;
than three bidders or for any decision not to select the lowest evaluated bidder, the Borrower will submit&#13;
its proposal to IDA for no-objection prior to notifying the winning bidder.&#13;
Additional Arrangements&#13;
42.   Contracts will be awarded within the agreed bid validity period and only exceptionally, bid&#13;
validity extension may be requested. In the case of fixed price contracts, requests for second and&#13;
subsequent extensions will be permissible only if the request for extension provides for an appropriate&#13;
adjustment mechanism of the quoted price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract over&#13;
the period of extension. Standard procurement times were agreed during negotiations. A procurement&#13;
plan for the project is proposed in Annex 7, based on these procurement times (see table 6 below).&#13;
F. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
43.    The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed on the following basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Total                           20.0&#13;
44.   IDA will finance a percentage of the works in addition to the local contribution to the cost of&#13;
investment shared between municipalities and the Government. This contribution depends of the type of&#13;
sub-project and the financial wealth of the municipalities defined by their annual actual operating&#13;
revenues. Three categories have been defined on the basis of actual revenues between the 1990-1995&#13;
period (Annex 3). Table 5 details the proposed local contribution. Percentages are also defined when the&#13;
Government is the contracting authority. These percentages have been discussed with most of Nigerien&#13;
municipalities and were confirmed during negotiations. Accuracy of disbursement percentages applied&#13;
by NIGETIP when preparing the withdrawal applications sent to IDA will be verified by the project&#13;
auditor.&#13;

45.    To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, two&#13;
Special Accounts will be opened in CFAF in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The authorized allocation for Special Account A (NBC) and Special Account B (NIGETIP) will be&#13;
CFAF 125 million and CFAF 800 million, respectively and cover about four months of eligible&#13;
expenditures. Upon effectiveness, an amount of CFAF 60 million representing 50% of the authorized&#13;
allocation will be deposited in the NBC Special Account, while CFAF 400 million will be deposited in&#13;
the NIGETIP Special Account. The remaining balance of Special Accounts A and B will be made&#13;
available, when the total amount withdrawn from the credit account and/or Special Commitments issued&#13;
amount to $1.2 million equivalent for Special Acount A and US$4 million equivalent for Special Acount&#13;
B. The Special Account will be used for all payments below CFAF 25 million for NBC and CFAF 160&#13;
million for NIGETIP. Replenishments will be submitted monthly. All replenishments should be fully&#13;
documented except for: (a) contracts of less than $250,000 equivalent for civil works and $100,000 for&#13;
goods, (b) contracts of less than $100,000 for consulting firms and $50,000 for individual consultants,&#13;

16                                            Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
training and seminars, which will be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). All&#13;
supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained for review by periodic Bank supervision missions&#13;
and external auditors.&#13;
G. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
46.   Accounting. NBC and NIGETIP will maintain records and accounts adequate to reflect, in&#13;
accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources and expenditures in respect of the&#13;
IDA credit. With PPF funds, a computerized management information system is being put in place in&#13;
NBC and NBC's staff is being trained to use the system. NIGETIP accounting procedures are being&#13;
updated and the computerized management information system upgraded with PPF funds. Analytical&#13;
accounting is being implemented to provide detailed information on the actual cost of NIGETIP services&#13;
for each contract of works. Implementation of the analytical accounting should be completed before&#13;
Credit effectiveness. Accounting procedures will be defined in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
47.   Auditing. The contract with the auditor of the project and NIGETIP accounts should be signed&#13;
before Credit effectiveness. During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to:&#13;
(a)    have the records and accounts referred to in the preceding paragraph including those for&#13;
the Special Accounts audited for each fiscal year every semester, in accordance with&#13;
appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, by independent auditors acceptable&#13;
to IDA;&#13;
(b)    furnish to IDA as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the&#13;
end of each semester, a certified copy of the report of such audit by said auditors, of such&#13;
scope and in such detail as IDA shall have reasonably requested; and&#13;
(c)    furnish to IDA such other information concerning said records and accounts and the&#13;
audit thereof as IDA shall from time to time reasonably request.&#13;
48.    For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Credit Account were made on&#13;
the basis of statements of expenditure, the Borrower shall:&#13;
(a)    maintain or cause to be maintained, in accordance with paragraph 46 records and&#13;
accounts reflecting such expenditures;&#13;
(b)    retain, until at least one year after IDA has received the audit report for the semester in&#13;
which the last withdrawal from the Credit Account or payment out of the Special&#13;
Accounts was made, all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts and other&#13;
documents) evidencing such expenditures;&#13;
(c)    enable IDA's representatives to examine such records; and&#13;
(d)    ensure that such records and accounts are included in the audits referred to in paragraph&#13;
47 and that the report of such audit contains a separate opinion by said auditors as to&#13;
whether the statements of expenditure submitted during each semester, together with the&#13;
procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to&#13;
support the related withdrawals.&#13;

H. REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
49.    Reporting. NIGETIP will issue periodic reports as follows: (a) summary monthly bulletins&#13;
within six days after the end of each month; (b) quarterly reports within six days following the end of the&#13;
trimester; (c) annual reports within three months following the end of the year; (d) a detailed report to&#13;
prepare the mid-term review; and (e) a project completion report within sixth months after the closing&#13;
date. Standard forms for the progress reports are included in the Manual of Procedures of NIGETIP.&#13;
NBC will prepare progress reports semiannually and in advance of each IDA's supervision mission. The&#13;
content and timing and a draft form of progress reports has been included in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan. The Borrower should submit an Implementation Completion Report to IDA no later than six&#13;
months after the closing date of the credit.&#13;
50.   Performance Indicators. Two types of indicators have been defined:&#13;
(a)    Key project performance indicators based on which IDA will decide at the mid-term&#13;
review whether to continue the project as appraised, restructure or cancel project's&#13;
components which are non performant. These indicators will reflect the degree with&#13;
which the project objectives are achieved. The value/target for these indicators as agreed&#13;
during negotiations are provided in table 6 below.&#13;
(b)    General project performance indicators will characterize progress in project execution,&#13;
project activities and outputs. A detailed list of indicators to be monitored is provided in&#13;
Annex 8.&#13;
51.   In addition to the financial audit mentioned above, NIGETIP's technical performance will be&#13;
audited every semester. The audit will assess the quality of the works, NIGETIP's compliance with its&#13;
Manual of Procedures and NIGETIP's overall performance, and make recommendations when necessary.&#13;
Although NIGETIP's performance has been satisfactory under the Public Works and Employment&#13;
Project, close monitoring of its performance is justified because NIGETIP is awarded a management&#13;
contract on a sole source basis. The Government of Niger, IDA and other donors using NIGETIP as&#13;
executing agency have to be satisfied that NIGETIP performs continuously well in planning, managing,&#13;
budgeting, procurement, supervision, reporting activities and that NIGETIP's staff has the necessary&#13;
capability and competence. The audit will also review the roster of consultants and contractors to&#13;
confirm that firms are registered in accordance with the criteria spelled out in NIGETIP's Manual of&#13;
Procedures. The technical audit will be carried out by an independent consultant. Terms of reference of&#13;
the audit are available in the project's files.&#13;
52.   Supervision Plan. The project will be supervised three times a year by IDA missions. Mission&#13;
activities will consist of field visits to work sites, review of financial and management practices, bidding&#13;
and disbursement procedures, and performance indicators. The missions will also evaluate the project&#13;
impact on the development of local contractors and consulting firms, on employment and on&#13;
environment. A particular emphasis will be put on the monitoring of the participation of beneficiaries in&#13;
the identification and design of sub-projects as well as on their operation and maintenance after their&#13;
execution. The supervision schedule and mission composition are presented in Annex 9.&#13;

53.   Mid-term Review. A mid-term review will be carried out no later than two years after credit&#13;
effectiveness. The review will be an opportunity to discuss with a larger group of stakeholders in the&#13;
urban sector (mayors, central and regional government authorities, communities, NGOs). The review&#13;
will include an ex-post environmental impact assessment of all sub-projects. The review will assess the&#13;
Government's continued commitment to the project's objectives. The Government agreed during&#13;
negotiations to the carrying out of the mid-term review. The Government's basic principles for urban&#13;
development are described in Annex 4. They were agreed during negotiations and should be confirmed&#13;
by the Government before Board presentation.&#13;
I. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
54.    The project is rated category B. An action plan to develop environmental protection with the&#13;
project's assistance is provided in Annex 10. The cumulative impact on the environment of small urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Niger - Urban Inftastructure Rehabililation Project                                      19&#13;
civil works is expected to be positive. The NIGETIP Manual of Procedures stipulates that sub-projects&#13;
judged harmful to their social end physical environment will not be eligible for execution to ensure that&#13;
they will not have a negative impact on the environment. Any environmental impact will be described in&#13;
the summary project sheet prepared by the municipalities. An environmental impact assessment will be&#13;
mandatory for all revenue-earning projects. The proposed mid-term review will include a post-evaluation&#13;
of the environmental impact of the project and formulate recommendations, if necessary, for the second&#13;
half of the project. The environmental impact of the project will be assessed during the preparation of the&#13;
Implementation Completion Report.&#13;
55.    An ex-post environmental assessment of small urban projects executed by NIGETIP in the past&#13;
was carried out with PPF financing. Based on this assessment, a guide was prepared to provide&#13;
guidelines for the carrying out of future environmental assessments. Training will be provided to sector&#13;
institutions, local consulting firms and NIGETIP in the use of the guide. Supervision missions will&#13;
monitor the compliance with the guide.&#13;
56.   In 1997, the Government has adopted a law which institutionalizes environmental studies for&#13;
economic development projects. The National Council for Environment (CNEDD) is the Coordinating&#13;
body for environmental management of economic development. With the creation of CNEDD, directives&#13;
were given requesting all governmental institutions to assign focal points for the environment. In the&#13;
Ministry of Equipment and Infrastructure, the Department of Urban Development and Housing is&#13;
responsible for planning and execution of urban sanitation investment programs. Municipalities are&#13;
responsible for the operation and maintenance of sanitation infrastructure and collection of solid waste.&#13;
Services are provided using force account.&#13;
57.    There is no strategy to prevent urban environment from deteriorating. Such deterioration results&#13;
from lack of resources for investment and maintenance of infrastructure and lack of capacity in the&#13;
Ministry and the municipalities. The project includes an urban sector environmental assessment, which&#13;
encompasses broader sector issues than those related to the small urban works carried out during the&#13;
project execution. The assessment will provide the basis to establish a strategy to manage environmental&#13;
issues and will identify capacity building requirements in the sector institutions to meet the requirements&#13;
of the 1997 legislation on mandatory environmental assessment of all development projects. A summary&#13;
of urban environmental issues is provided in Annex 11.&#13;
J. BENEFITS&#13;
58.    Benefits are:&#13;
(a)    In the short-term, poverty reduction by creating employment for unskilled workers who&#13;
are most represented among the urban poor, and a boost to the local economy due to the&#13;
multiplier effect resulting from the payment by the project of expenditures covering&#13;
mostly local costs: About 730,000 person-days of employment are expected to be&#13;
generated over the project execution. A minimum ratio of 20 percent will be required for&#13;
the amount of wages versus the amount of the works financed under the project. Annual&#13;
surveys will be carried out to monitor the ratio of salaries for unskilled employees versus&#13;
the total amount of salaries.&#13;
(b)    In the short-term, inhabitants of municipalities will benefit from the infrastructure&#13;
financed under the project. Environmental impact assessments, involvement of&#13;
beneficiaries in the identification and design of the projects, willingness-to-pay surveys&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                              Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
will aim at ensuring that those who ultimately pay for the projects are the ones who will&#13;
benefit from it.&#13;
(c)    In the medium-term, an improved capacity of local contractors and engineering firms:&#13;
The project includes a training component aimed at strengthening the capacity of local&#13;
contractors and consulting firms in several areas related to planning, design and&#13;
execution of infrastructure projects with the objective of creating a work force available&#13;
for local governments instead of calling on the central government services; and&#13;
(d)    In the long-term, improved planning methods and capacity of municipalities to anticipate&#13;
instead of lagging behind uncontrolled urban development: (i) All sub-projects will be&#13;
subject to an economic or financial analysis and environmental impact assessment.&#13;
Municipalities' staff and local consulting firms will be trained in this respect. (ii) The&#13;
project will help to develop simple tools tailored to the human and financial capacities in&#13;
the local governments.&#13;
59.    A minimum economic or financial rate of return of 12 percent will be required for revenue-&#13;
earning sub-projects and 10 percent for those non revenue-earning sub-projects where a rate of return can&#13;
be estimated. During project preparation, simple standardized procedures were set up to calculate rates of&#13;
return of sub-projects. Staff in Niamey's municipalities, the Ministry of Equipment and Infrastructure&#13;
and NIGETIP were trained to use the software used for the calculations. Staff of other municipalities and&#13;
local consulting firms will be trained during project execution. For the purpose of sensitivity studies,&#13;
shadow pricing of 50 percent was used for the wages of unskilled workers. Annex 12 provides the&#13;
economic and financial justification of a set of sub-projects already executed under various financing.&#13;
This sample has demonstrated the need to use economic or financial criteria in the preparation of sub-&#13;
projects as some sub-projects have been found to have rates of return below the thresholds in table 6&#13;
above. This results in particular of the low level of revenues generated by the contracting out to private&#13;
operators of revenue-earning infrastructure compared to the investment cost. Preparation studies will&#13;
have to be carried out in consultation with beneficiaries of revenue-earning sub-projects in order to&#13;
ensure that there is enough potential of revenues to cover at least the depreciation cost of the&#13;
infrastructure financed under the project or that the project is redesigned in order to meet this criterion.&#13;
60.    Because of the low level of municipal resources and the need to increase these resources to better&#13;
cover urban investment requirements, priority will be given under the project to revenue-earning sub-&#13;
projects. To reflect this priority, a percentage of 60 percent is targeted for revenue-earning sub-projects&#13;
at project completion. Compliance with this target will be monitored during supervision missions.&#13;
Supervision missions will also monitor the amount of revenues collected from revenue-earning projects&#13;
financed under the project. Non revenue-earning sub-projects will include some social sub-projects for&#13;
which an ERR will not be calculated. These sub-projects should meet sectoral priority criteria and follow&#13;
procedures of sector programs that have an average ERR above 10 percent. Taking into account the&#13;
limited amount of resources available under the project, emergency sub-projects and non revenue-&#13;
earning sub-projects which do not meet the above criteria will not be eligible to IDA financing. The&#13;
amount of sub-projects not subject to an economic or financial analysis should not exceed one twelfth of&#13;
the total amount of works.&#13;

K. RISKS&#13;
61.    Several risks have been identified:&#13;
(a)    Poor quality of sub-projects is a risk that occurred in the on-going Public Works and&#13;
Employment Project as demonstrated by ex-post rates of return below the thresholds&#13;
established for this project or by urban infrastructure which is not in service several&#13;
years after works were completed. This risk will be mitigated by a greater involvement&#13;
of beneficiaries in the identification, design and operation of sub-projects and increased&#13;
emphasis given to project preparation including the carrying out of economic or financial&#13;
analysis and environmental assessments of sub-projects. The quality of the studies and&#13;
works execution will be reviewed by the semi-annual technical audits of the project.&#13;
Contractors and consultants will be trained on the basis of the recommendations of the&#13;
audits.&#13;
(b)    Revenue-earning infrastructure might fail to generate revenues as expected, thus&#13;
increasing the municipalities' financial burden. This risk will be mitigated by involving&#13;
users of the infrastructure in the design of the project and carrying out willingness-to-pay&#13;
surveys.&#13;
(c)    To mitigate the risk of lack of counterpart funds, the Government and the municipalities&#13;
will be requested to provide their contribution to any works contract financed from the&#13;
IDA credit prior to the signature of the contract. The multiplier effect of counterpart&#13;
funds is expected to generate competition between the municipalities to access to limited&#13;
IDA resources, therefore to reduce the risk of lack of counterpart funds.&#13;
(d)    Lack of maintenance of infrastructure is a risk that occurred mostly only for the&#13;
maintenance of roads financed under the Public Works and Employment Project.&#13;
Although proper maintenance of infrastructure was a criteria of eligibility for new sub-&#13;
projects identified by contracting authorities, the terms of the Manual of Procedures&#13;
were such that NIGETIP was not actually entitled to enforce the criteria. The Manual of&#13;
Procedures has been revised to include a clause which makes mandatory one visit of the&#13;
infrastructure by the contracting authority and NIGETIP every year to identify&#13;
maintenance works and one visit to control the satisfactory execution of the maintenance&#13;
works. In the case where 25 percent of the portfolio of sub-projects executed under the&#13;
project is not maintained, the municipality will become ineligible to the financing of&#13;
additional portfolios until its entire portfolio is properly maintained. Compliance with&#13;
this criterion will also be monitored by the technical audits of the project.&#13;
(e)    Contractors and consulting firms may not survive if the project is not followed up by a&#13;
similar operation after its completion. If the proposed project is well managed and&#13;
achieve its objectives, it is highly likely that donors will be keen on financing a follow&#13;
up.&#13;
(f)    The Government may seek, for political reasons, to influence NIGETIP in the definition&#13;
of the biannual portfolios of sub-projects. This risk will be mitigated by the emphasis put&#13;
on beneficiary participation and economic justification of sub-projects&#13;
&#13;

IICRAD (a politically motivated division of the country into districts presented in lieu of a decentralization policy plus an uninspired proposal to establish a&#13;
bureaucratic network of committees for administrative reform established in each ministry and major public organization and which would report to the&#13;
HCRAD) to a more relevant strategy under which it would effectively play the role of a policy orientation/formulation and implementation support&#13;
organization.&#13;

After several years of slow and even negative growth, Niger's economy posted 4% real&#13;
GDP growth in 1994, which was a level appreciably above the population growth rate estimated at&#13;
3.3%. However, as of 1995 the growth rate dropped back to a low 1.7% as a result of a bad crop&#13;
year and slumping industrial production which led to a decline of 6.5% in the modem sector's&#13;
added value.&#13;
In the context of the program signed by Niger with the Bretton Woods institutions, one of&#13;
the macroeconomic objectives pursued is to achieve real GDP growth of 4.2% for 1996/97 and an&#13;
average growth rate in excess of 4% for the period 1996-98. This would require the informal&#13;
sector, which accounts for about 70% of GDP, to grow by 4.6% in 1996 and the modem sector by&#13;
5%.&#13;
The main objective of the Government's medium-term program is accordingly to&#13;
consolidate the progress already made in stabilizing the economy and to promote development of&#13;
an environment favorable to sustainable economic growth based on highly labor-intensive&#13;
activities, together with reduction of poverty. Economic growth will also depend on swift and&#13;
orderly settlement of the State's domestic and foreign payments arrears, with a view to restoring the&#13;
private sector's confidence, together with efforts to increase absorption capacity and improve the&#13;
quality of investments.&#13;
In view of the social problems facing the country, the Government intends to redefine its&#13;
priorities concerning expenditures on social services, maintenance of existing infrastructure and&#13;
investments.&#13;
II.  THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND THE PROGRAM OF ACTION FOR&#13;
DECENTRALIZATION AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Since the 1980s Niger has been experiencing an acute crisis which has not spared any&#13;
sector of public life. The administration is no longer meeting the development needs for which it&#13;
was set up and the decentralization advocated since Law 64-032 of July 17, 1964, has never really&#13;
materialized.&#13;
The fact is that there is an excessive centralization of powers at the central level. For some&#13;
years now the Niger Government has had to cope with a combination of two major constraints: on&#13;
the one hand, the fact that the administrative system is unsuited for meeting the population's needs,&#13;
and on the other, the timid implementation of decentralization.&#13;
Reform is a necessity and the Government, which possesses the requisite political will, has&#13;
set up an appropriate framework for study of the situation. In the course of the past few years the&#13;
country has also undergone an extremely rapid urbanization process which is not readily&#13;
controllable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4                                                                           37&#13;
In order to move beyond a situation of "catch-up urban development" as quickly as&#13;
possible, the authorities have decided to embark on a policy of sustainable development for the&#13;
urban centers.&#13;
A.    Approaches and objectives&#13;
Following the various discussions at ministerial level, the Government's actions concerning&#13;
decentralization and urban development will be guided by the approaches and objectives set forth&#13;
below:&#13;
1.    Deepening of democracy at the regional and local level through the implementation of&#13;
decentralization;&#13;
2.    Assignment of responsibility for local development to the respective local authorities;&#13;
3.    Pursuit of balanced and sustainable urban development;&#13;
4.    Modernization and deconcentration of the machinery of government;&#13;
5.    Provision of viable urban infrastructure and services throughout the country.&#13;
B.    Strategies&#13;
The Government's action will be guided by the following strategies:&#13;
1.    Transferring of certain powers from the State to the local authorities;&#13;
2.    Strengthening of the mobilization of potential local resources by means of:&#13;
-     taxation that is better adapted for covering the real costs of urbanization;&#13;
-     better control of the tax base;&#13;
-     more efficient collection methods.&#13;
3.    Seeking to ensure the economic and financial feasibility of local authority development&#13;
projects by systematically bringing expenditures (capital and operating) into alignment with&#13;
the available and/or mobilizable resources;&#13;
4.    Opening the way for a public/private partnership for the swift execution of certain&#13;
development and infrastructure projects that have been carried out up to the present by the&#13;
local authorities along;&#13;
5.    Strengthening of the organizational and design capacities of the sector institutions;&#13;
6.    Gradual withdrawal by the Government from production functions in favor of a refocusing&#13;
of its role on assistance to local authorities in management, urban planning and investment&#13;
programming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 11                                                                         55&#13;
Annex 11: Urban Environmental Issues&#13;
1.    The environmental problems of Nigerien cities stem from the exceptional burst in urban&#13;
development in the past, urban dwellers' lack of awareness or interest in the needs of their&#13;
environment and lack of expertise and resources in the municipalities and institutions in the&#13;
Government in charge of urban development to address urban problems. These include water&#13;
supply and quality, sewage and drainage systems, solid waste disposal, pollution from energy&#13;
production and manufacturing, poor or absent city planning and lack of decent housing. Poverty&#13;
in cities forces large number of people to live in unsanitary conditions caused by lack of access&#13;
to either health care or to alternative environments.&#13;
2.    Many of Niger's health problems are directly related to unclean water supplies. In times&#13;
of drought, the cities of Niamey and Tillabery which are supplied by the Niger River, struggle to&#13;
provide water when the river runs dry. Surface and shallow water sources are easily&#13;
contaminated by household, agricultural and industrial waste. In 1988, only 60 percent of&#13;
Nigeriens had access to safe water and many of the remaining people must use public standpipes&#13;
or buy the water privately. However, Niger has not encountered the problems of permanent&#13;
aquifer depletion or salinization as in other Sahelien cities.&#13;
3.    Sewage treatment exists partially in only the six largest cities and generally not in their&#13;
newer neighborhood. Sewage is disposed in individual pits, in the drainage system, in the streets&#13;
or in the rivers. The 120 km long drainage system in Niamey is unable to absorb flash floods in&#13;
the rainy season, which wash away roads and flimsy houses and spread waste from households&#13;
and dumps. Although ten mini stations for sewage treatment exist in Niamey and are used by&#13;
hospitals, universities, industries and Government institutions), 90 percent of them do not work&#13;
correctly or are out of service.&#13;
4.    Solid waste is dumped in agricultural fields where it decays, attracts vermin and can be&#13;
caught by the wind or floods. Solid waste is irregularly collected by trucks in Niamey or donkeys&#13;
and carts in other cities. In neighborhoods with recent rural emigrants who are not accustomed to&#13;
living in crowded areas, garbage is often dumped in the streets. Poor urban road networks is a&#13;
major handicap in effective solid waste removal.&#13;
5.    Higher rates of respiratory problems have been found in urban areas than in rural areas.&#13;
They may result from unclean energy production. The primary source of energy used in urban&#13;
areas is wood, which produces smoke and ashes. Coal and oil-fired power plants near certain&#13;
cities produce air pollution too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 12: Economic Analysis&#13;
1.    Criteria for the eligibility of sub-projects include economic, financial and technical&#13;
justification prepared in a summary sheet by the requesting municipality. Due to the small scale of&#13;
sub-projects, a simplified economic appraisal procedure has been set up using computer software to&#13;
calculate the economic rate of return (ERR). A detailed report (Analyse et selection des projets sur&#13;
la base des taux de rentabilite economique et financiere, December 1996) is available in the project&#13;
files.&#13;
2.    Methodology. The economic rate of return is defined as the rate which nullifies the net&#13;
present value of costs and benefits.&#13;
n      f (k)&#13;
NPV (ERR, f(1), f(2), ..., f(n)) = E_    -    ......... = 0 for n years of project life,&#13;
k=l  (1+ERR)k&#13;
where f(k)    =     (Net Cash Flow)k&#13;
(Project Benefit) k - (Project Cost) k&#13;
[(Benefit with Project) k - (Benefit without Project) k]&#13;
- [(Cost with Project) k - (Cost without Project) k]&#13;
for any year k&#13;
3.    The following is an example of the calculation for the rehabilitation of a classroom. The&#13;
classroom is deteriorated and is estimated to need full reconstruction in six years. The municipality&#13;
has to determine whether to rehabilitate it now or to rebuild it in six years. The investment cost is&#13;
estimated at CFAF100 million for the construction of a new classroom and CFAF35 for the&#13;
rehabilitation. Maintenance is estimated to cost CFAF1 million per year. The net cash flow then is:&#13;
f(l)=-35; f(2) to f(5)=-1; f(6)=-1-(-100)=99.&#13;
The ERR amounts to 21 percent (22 percent with shadow pricing on the wages of unskilled&#13;
workers).&#13;
4.    12 sub-projects executed by NIGETIP were submitted to an ex-post economic analysis&#13;
during project preparation. The results were:&#13;
(a) economic rate of return of non revenue-earning sub-projects:&#13;
(i)   rehabilitation of an administrative building: 27 percent;&#13;
(ii)   construction of a new administrative building: 4 percent;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(iii)   construction of a road paved with cement concrete blocks: 21 percent;&#13;
(iv)   drainage: 28 percent;&#13;
(b)    financial rate of return of revenue-earning sub-projects:&#13;
(i)    construction of a stadium: 20 percent;&#13;
(ii)   improvement of a public garden: -14 percent;&#13;
(iii)   construction of a market: 13 percent;&#13;
(iv)   construction of a road transport terminal: 45 percent;&#13;
(v)    construction of a slaughterhouse: 39 percent;&#13;
(vi)   construction of a public latrine: -11 percent;&#13;
(vii)  construction of a car pound: 22 percent;&#13;
(viii)  construction of a youth center: 8 percent.&#13;

            Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The development objectives of the Urban
            Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project are (1) to reduce
            poverty in urban areas by creating employment; (2) to
            provide municipalities with skills to develop and manage
            their infrastructure; and (3) to promote local engineering
            firms and contractors, labor-based methods, and local
            materials.  The project's three components are: (1) a
            civil works component, including executing a program of
            small urban works, identifying sub-projects, including
            economic/financial analyses, environmental impact
            assessments and consultation with beneficiaries, and
            engineering studies and works supervision; (2) institutional
            building comprising (a) supporting municipalities with a
            study to simplify tools to plan urban infrastructure
            development, deriving a methodology for a development
            strategy to provide urban services and to mobilize
            resources, basic cartography of two cities, preparing
            feasibility studies and a pilot operation to involve a
            private property developer, giving technical assistance and
            consulting services, conducting ex-post environmental
            assessments of employment projects, helping to define the
            new legal framework for communes, and revising the commune
            budget structure, and (b) private sector promotion by  by
            using local materials in the construction industry, and
            training local consulting firms and local contractors; and
            (3) project execution, involving improving management of the
            Niger agency for public works and employment (NIGETIP),
            auditing this agency and the works programs it executes,
            reviewing operating costs of the project's coordination
            unit, and providing technical assistance and equipment.
