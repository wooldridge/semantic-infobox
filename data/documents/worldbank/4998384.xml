As a result of considerable neglect&#13;
over a long period, a number&#13;
of different 'management'&#13;

have emerged.&#13;

- The NCBDA has been allocated 12 PT units after almost two years of negotiations with the NCC. Private operators allocated the facilities by the NCBDA had been able&#13;
to pull down the dilapidated structures and in their place put up six ultra-modern units by June 2003. A further three were under renovation in December 2003&#13;

The lessons considered applicable  * Changing the role of NCC in       cartel control.&#13;
to Nairobi's case are summarized   direct management to one of         Three management models&#13;
in Box 3.                          policy formulation and oversight.   were considered:&#13;
* Retaining ownership by NCC&#13;
Management Models                  (asset holding).                    * Private sector management&#13;
Considered                         * Causing minimum disruption to     contracts of PTs refurbished by NCC.&#13;
the existing NCC structure.        * Private company wholly owned&#13;
The PSP study investigated options  * Meeting costs of the initial repairs  by NCC.&#13;
and scenarios for PSP in PT        and rehabilitation.                 * Concession contracts (build,&#13;
management. The aim of             * Meeting costs of subsequent       finance, and operate).&#13;
Some benefits of PSP in PT service delivery&#13;
* Alternative source of financing&#13;
Private sector operators can mobilize capital funds for rehabilitation, etc.&#13;
User fees can provide the finance needed to sustain PT operations. They may even be able to support the&#13;
development of additional PTs in the city.&#13;
*  Increased productivity and quality service&#13;
Private sector management of public toilets can realize increased productivity of employees, speed up&#13;
decision-making, and, if firmly monitored, consistently maintain clean and hygienic toilets. This will also&#13;
include the quality of contracts, monitoring, tariff-setting, building capacity of contractors, etc.&#13;
Changes required to facilitate PSP in PT service delivery&#13;
*  Legal and regulatory framework&#13;
The Local Authorities Act allows the NCC to permit private sector management of some of its activities.&#13;
However, NCC bylaws on PT management do not expressly allow PSP and therefore require amendment&#13;
to permit PSP in an area that has hitherto been the sole responsibility of the NCC.&#13;
*  Institutional adjustments&#13;
There is a need to establish sufficient capacity within the NCC to enable it to respond to PT issues&#13;
effic enily and promptly.&#13;
*  Public perception and attitude&#13;
Grealer public education is required to increase awareness of the benefits of improved environmental&#13;
sanitation, and proper care and use of public facilities.&#13;
')India, Sulabh pubilc toilets; Kumasi, Ghana; and Kampala, Uganda, show experiences that could be drawn on by Nairobi n its endeavor to privatize PT operations.&#13;

The use of management    I l        to generate data and feedback for&#13;

disruption to the NCC, did not enable  contracts. The two options selected         LE-L CLEAN&#13;

            From hazard to convenience : towards better
            management of public toilets in the city of Nairobi
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Most of Nairobi's 138 public
            toilets (PTs) were built during the colonial era or soon
            afterwards.  They are now owned by the Nairobi City Council
            (NCC), but for a variety of reasons they have received
            little maintenance or management attention for the last 20
            years and many are in a very unhygienic, barely functioning
            state.  A number of different NGOs and individuals
            (including street children) have tried to fill this void in
            management.  This note reviews these arrangements:  most
            were found wanting in a number of respects, including
            hygiene and long overdue refurbishment.  To assist the NCC
            in addressing the situation, the Africa Water and Sanitation
            Program undertook a study of the refurbishment, management,
            and operation of public toilets in Ghana, Burkina Faso,
            Uganda, and India, and concluded that there was considerable
            potential for private sector participation in PT management
            in Nairobi. This note summarizes the findings of that study
            and subsequent developments.
