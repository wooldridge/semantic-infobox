&#13;
&#13;
The coastal areas of the Northern Cape, South Africa, and the transfrontier region&#13;
with Namibia are in a state of rapid transformation from a mining-based economy to&#13;
one supporting diverse and sustainable livelihoods. Land-based diamond mining&#13;
activities are in the early stages of decommissioning while a number of planning and&#13;
development initiatives are underway. Key obstacles to integrated planning and&#13;
development in the region are insufficient and inaccessible information. Knowledge&#13;
management and information sharing mechanisms can facilitate meaningful&#13;
participation and promote decision-making at the local level. The Distance Learning&#13;
and Information Sharing Tool (DLIST) is an Internet based knowledge management&#13;
tool that promotes transparency and collaboration and provides open access to&#13;
information resources for sustainable development.&#13;

                                    1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The coastal areas in the Northern Cape, South Africa, and the transfrontier region&#13;
with Namibia are in a state of rapid transition. For many decades access to 90 percent&#13;
of the coastline remained restricted due to diamond mining activities (Figure 1).&#13;
However, viable land-based diamond deposits in the ancient coastal marine terraces&#13;
are now becoming depleted causing the major mining houses to begin to scale down&#13;
their mining activities. This will result in the opening up of vast tracks of coastal areas&#13;
for land uses other than mining. Downscaling by the diamond mining industry, the&#13;
largest employer in the region, is already having a dramatic effect on the livelihood of&#13;
inhabitants. Typically the loss of one job translates to a loss of income for an entire&#13;
family or extended family. Fortunately alternative livelihood options are emerging&#13;
through a number of development initiatives and planning processes. Activities in the&#13;
coastal areas currently include livestock farming, agriculture, fishing and harvesting&#13;
of living marine resources, mariculture, tourism and conservation. All of these&#13;
activities are likely to expand in a post-mining era. Careful and pro-active planning&#13;
that involves all role players is essential if the negative effects of downscaling are to&#13;
be mitigated through the development of new livelihood options and better utilization&#13;
of the region's attributes.&#13;
&#13;
This paper investigates the role of knowledge management (KM) and information&#13;
sharing in facilitating integrated development planning in the coastal areas of the&#13;
Northern Cape, South Africa, and the transfrontier region with Namibia. The paper&#13;
describes how the Distance Learning and Information Sharing Tool (DLIST), a&#13;
Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded IW:LEARN pilot project, is attempting to&#13;
aid a collective approach to sustainable development. As DLIST works on the&#13;
principle of information gathering from a wide range of sources, "lessons learned"&#13;
from current initiatives are discussed briefly and recommendations are made for the&#13;
World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg 2002.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
2.1 From Mining to Post-mining&#13;
&#13;
The mining industry has been the dominant force for many decades in the&#13;
transfrontier region that includes Namaqualand, as the western part of the Northern&#13;
Cape Province is known, and the southern parts of Namibia. To fully understand its&#13;
impacts and the implications of decommissioning for the coastal areas in the Northern&#13;
Cape and Southern Namibia, it is necessary to review briefly the events that have led&#13;
to the status quo.&#13;
&#13;
In Southern Namibia commercial exploitation of diamonds began in the early&#13;
twentieth century. While mining was confined to within a few kilometers of the coast,&#13;
a 100 km wide restricted area, the Sperrgebiet was declared to restrict access to the&#13;
tightly controlled diamond business. The Sperrgebiet has been closed to the public for&#13;
more than eighty years. In 1994, NAMDEB was established as an equal partnership&#13;
between the mining company and the Namibian government. The Sperrgebiet&#13;
contains significant levels of biodiversity and is considered a national conservation&#13;
priority [References 1, 2, 3]. In view of the multiple-use potential of the area, the&#13;
Government of Namibia agreed that the area should be more fully utilized and a Land&#13;
Use Plan was commissioned by the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism&#13;
[Reference 4]. From the point of view of environmental protection, diamond mining&#13;
in the Sperrgebiet is a double-edged sword: while surface damage in the coastal&#13;
regions are considerable, the bulk of the Sperrgebiet's 26 000 km2 has remained in a&#13;
near-pristine state.&#13;
&#13;
On the South African side, commercial mining operations began in earnest in 1928&#13;
with the establishment of the State Alluvial Diggings (SAD) at Alexander Bay. This&#13;
led to restricted access to the coast extending from the Orange River Mouth to south&#13;
of Port Nolloth, an area managed by the South African Department of Mineral and&#13;
Energy Affairs. In 1992 the Alexander Bay Development Corporation became&#13;
Alexkor Ltd., a company in its own right with a Board of Directors and the South&#13;
African Government as the sole shareholder. The activities of the mining company&#13;
have since broadened and it has invested in the development of varied non-core&#13;
activities including tourism and mariculture [References 5, 6]. The Alexkor Ltd.&#13;
Amendment Bill passed in 2001 paves the way for the privatization of the mine and&#13;
large-scale strategic planning for the post-mining era.&#13;
&#13;
Extensive decommissioning of land-based mining operations throughout the region&#13;
has resulted in substantial levels of unemployment. Following the history of the once&#13;
lucrative copper mines in the interior of Namaqualand, the land-based diamond mines&#13;
of the coastal areas are fast losing their erstwhile power to uphold the economy. The&#13;
conversion from a largely mining-based economy to alternative livelihood options&#13;
will require greater attention to sustainable and innovative utilization of the region's&#13;
"natural advantages."&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2 The Region's "Natural Advantages"&#13;
&#13;
The cold, nutrient-rich Benguela Current System is a major force shaping both the&#13;
physical land and the ecology along the Namaqualand and Namibian coastlines, and&#13;
into Angola. The upwelling process characterizing the Benguela Current System&#13;
results in a phenomenally high biomass of plants and animals and many organisms&#13;
occur along this coast at densities and biomass levels unequaled elsewhere in the&#13;
world. Today, the coastal and marine resources of the region are still largely exploited&#13;
by outsiders and processed in larger centers such as Cape Town [Reference 7]. The&#13;
Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 is aimed at addressing these issues and is&#13;
slowly resulting in institutional strengthening and equitable redistribution of&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;
On land, one of the most potentially sustainable resources is tourism. The area is&#13;
blessed with spectacular landscapes, both inland and along the coast. The&#13;
Richtersveld is home to astonishing biodiversity [Reference 8] and is described by&#13;
international organizations such as Conservation International (CI), and botanical&#13;
experts as one of the world's most significant biodiversity "hotspots" in arid regions.&#13;
Importantly, despite surface damage caused by the mines, the diamond mining&#13;
industry has successfully curtailed outside influences along the coast by controlling&#13;
access to the diamond-rich areas and buffer zones. This has resulted in the protection&#13;
of significant near-pristine sections of the coast, some of which are worthy of the&#13;
designation of Sensitive Coastal Area (SCA). The main challenge in the development&#13;
of tourism will be to ensure that the region's local inhabitants are the main&#13;
beneficiaries of the industry.&#13;
&#13;
2.3 Integrated Development Planning&#13;
&#13;
Within the transfrontier region a number of planning and development initiatives are&#13;
occurring simultaneously. Planning processes include, among others: The Gariep&#13;
Spatial Development Initiative (SDI); a three-country transfrontier conservation area&#13;
(TFCA)1 initiative spearheaded by Conservation International and an array of&#13;
government departments and agencies; a Transfrontier Park that joins the existing&#13;
Richtersveld National Park (RNP) with the Ais-Ais Park in Namibia; an Integrated&#13;
Development Planning (IDP) process; and various sector plans and strategic plans for&#13;
the mining houses. The joining of the Sperrgebiet with the Ais-ais/Richtersveld&#13;
Transfrontier Park will create a three-country transfrontier unbroken string of&#13;
protected areas (Figure 2).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This "Big Picture" on paper must now translate into areas that are protected&#13;
effectively and will bring as much benefit to the people of the three countries of&#13;
Angola, Namibia and South Africa. What is evident from the picture is that coastal&#13;
areas of Namibia are far better protected than in the Northern Cape. However, there is&#13;
progress in the transfrontier region. The emerging integrated conservation and&#13;
development framework in the transfrontier region consists of a lattice of existing and&#13;
proposed areas that will be protected or will fall under some sort of resource&#13;
management system (Figure 3).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Development initiatives underway in the region include a number of poverty&#13;
alleviation projects funded through the South African Department of Environmental&#13;
Affairs and Tourism (DEA&amp;T), a NORAD program funded through the DEA&amp;T and&#13;
a Global Environment Facility PDF Block A award for Medium-Sized Project (MSP)&#13;
for which local government has been the proponent since its inception.&#13;
&#13;
Undertaking truly integrated development planning in this region is presents a major&#13;
challenge. In order to facilitate planning for sustainable development, obstacles to the&#13;
process must first be understood. The following have been identified as major&#13;
impediments to planning in the transfrontier region:&#13;
&#13;
·   Participation in planning is a new experience for many of the people. Planning in&#13;
    South Africa was previously imposed in a "top down" manner on the majority of&#13;
    the population. Although recent policies and legislation require integrated&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      6 Rejoice Mabudafhasi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    development planning by local government, difficulties are experienced in its&#13;
    implementation and lessons continue to emerge [Reference 9]. Although strongly&#13;
    rooted in the law, not all role players understand the significance and benefits&#13;
    associated with large scale planning initiatives such as the Integrated&#13;
    Development Planning (IDP) process.&#13;
&#13;
·   Reliable information is frequently difficult to obtain. Information flow remains&#13;
    restricted to the educated and privileged tiers of society and there is a tendency to&#13;
    "privatize" information that is considered a valuable currency. Participatory&#13;
    planning is challenging when people are insufficiently informed. Access to&#13;
    information and its poor flow through society is considered to be a major&#13;
    constraint in development planning. Planning by the major role player in the&#13;
    region, the mining industry, is often considered insufficiently transparent and&#13;
    exclusive.&#13;
&#13;
·   Despite the involvement of multiple role players in initiatives in the transfrontier&#13;
    area, the lack of a formal overarching integrated planning framework makes it&#13;
    difficult to prepare a single plan for sustainable development at sub-national&#13;
    levels.&#13;
&#13;
The question arises as to the role of knowledge management (KM) and information&#13;
sharing in overcoming these obstacles to integrated development planning.&#13;
Specifically, given the diversity of development activities and planning processes&#13;
underway in the transfrontier region, can KM improve the synchrony, synergy and&#13;
harmonization of the different integrated conservation and development initiatives by&#13;
facilitating information sharing and improving access to relevant information? The&#13;
premise would be that information sharing and improved accessibility to knowledge&#13;
for a range of role players would facilitate convergence in planning for sustainable&#13;
outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      3. The Need for Information Sharing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The gradual conversion of an entire region from an economy based largely on mining&#13;
to one supporting diverse and sustainable livelihoods, presents many challenges. Lack&#13;
of information and poor information flow between the different parties in the region&#13;
are identified as the most persistent obstacles are has manifest in striking ways. Poor&#13;
people have inhabited a coast that is extremely rich in natural resources without&#13;
knowing the value of them, let alone obtaining access to them. This lack of&#13;
information prevents meaningful participation by local people in planning processes.&#13;
Poor information flow prevents synergy between different initiatives and can create&#13;
serious conflicts. It is from this context that the issue arose of how best to improve&#13;
information sharing in a geographically vast and marginalized area where much of the&#13;
crucial information is available only in restricted localities and is accessible to a select&#13;
few.&#13;

&#13;
     4. The Distance Learning Information Sharing Tool (DLIST)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A meeting of the Northern Cape Coastal Working Group (NCCWG)2 was held in late&#13;
1998 to identify opportunities for coastal management in the region. A subsequent&#13;
workshop facilitated by the World Bank investigated the opportunities for&#13;
strengthening information sharing in the region. Workshop participants including a&#13;
range of Northern Cape and Namibian stakeholders, welcomed the possibility of a&#13;
Distance Learning Information Sharing Tool (DLIST) for the region.&#13;
&#13;
Broad-based workshops followed throughout the region, and were augmented by&#13;
smaller intensive sessions with groups such as the Namibian regional councils of&#13;
Erongo and Karas, all levels of government, the Multi-Purpose Resource Centers&#13;
(MPRCs), and project leaders of other programs. The purpose of these interactions&#13;
was to determine the sources of existing information and knowledge, mechanisms&#13;
with which to access them and to assess information needs of the different&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
Preparations were then made for an Internet-based Distance Learning Information&#13;
Sharing Tool (DLIST). DLIST was incorporated into emerging regional integrated&#13;
conservation and development planning frameworks, including the DEA&amp;T's Poverty&#13;
Relief and CoastCare programs, the IDP process and the South-North Tourism Route&#13;
(Odendaal, 2002). For instance, poverty alleviation funding from the DEA&amp;T was&#13;
used to establish a Multi-Purpose Resource Center in Hondeklipbaai, while other&#13;
poverty alleviation programs provided computer training of a variety of community-&#13;
based organizations (CBOs) and individuals. The CoastCare program of the Chief&#13;
Directorate of Marine and Coastal Management and the DEA&amp;T's NORAD program&#13;
assisted in the establishment of offices with internet access facilities that now serve&#13;
both as information gathering and dissemination points.&#13;
&#13;
DLIST3 aims to facilitate information sharing and knowledge management, through&#13;
the following broad objectives:&#13;
&#13;
·   To foster networking opportunities between coastal role players involved in&#13;
    sustainable development, in order to establish functional information and&#13;
    knowledge sharing "communities of practice"&#13;
&#13;
·   To optimize planning and implementation of effective and appropriate integrated&#13;
    coastal zone management solutions for the region, through collaborative problem&#13;
    solving and planning&#13;
&#13;
·   To develop an internet-mediated learning environment that assists in developing a&#13;
    strategic development plan for the region&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
·   To create an ongoing and self-sustaining learning and information-sharing tool&#13;
    that promotes knowledge exchange, problem analysis, development of a&#13;
    collaborative approach to problem solving, and provision of an opportunity to&#13;
    contribute to planning processes.&#13;
&#13;
To achieve these objectives, DLIST would have two main components: distance&#13;
learning and information sharing. The distance learning component would be based&#13;
primarily on short modules that cover various aspects of Integrated Coastal&#13;
Management (ICM) that could be accessed on the DLIST website. The website&#13;
modules would be supported by short courses on an as-needed basis. The information&#13;
sharing component of DLIST would focus on various means of gathering&#13;
information, organizing it, making it accessible and on promoting a two-way flow of&#13;
information between stakeholders and a common "pool of knowledge" and between&#13;
one another.&#13;
&#13;
The following ideas emerged from the detailed discussions on how DLIST should&#13;
function and were incorporated into development of the tool:&#13;
&#13;
·   Information from a wide range of sources should flow into a central "pool of&#13;
   information" where it would be organized and packaged in a manner that would&#13;
   make it more accessible to a wide audience.&#13;
&#13;
·   The flow of information should be a continuous process considering the dynamic&#13;
   nature of the region. Information content should be steered largely by the needs of&#13;
   the users.&#13;
&#13;
·   Flow of information should be a two-way process encouraging both retrieval and&#13;
   contribution. Hence the common "pool" of information will assist planners,&#13;
   developers and role players to optimize synergy and reduce conflict as much as&#13;
   possible.&#13;
&#13;
·   Information exchange facilitated by DLIST should assist role players to develop&#13;
   consensus on development priorities, funding strategies and action plans to&#13;
   implement coastal projects and programs.&#13;
&#13;
·   A need exists for both an ICM training course and an information sharing function&#13;
   closely interwoven with one another. The former should be at a level that is&#13;
   understandable to CBOs and local councilors. Higher level ICM training could be&#13;
   accessed through courses offered by universities. Several large donor programs,&#13;
   including the Benguela Environment Fisheries Interaction and Training&#13;
   (BENEFIT) program, the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (BCMLE)&#13;
   program, and the Namib Coast Biodiversity Conservation and Integrated&#13;
   Ecosystem Management (NACOMA) Program have funds allocated to intensive&#13;
   ICM training, if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
The information sharing element of DLIST can best be described as a "pool of&#13;
knowledge" that is constantly growing. Information flows into the pool from a range&#13;
of sources,4 or "information communities" that are linked to the "pool of knowledge"&#13;
in a manner facilitating retrieval of useful information on an as-needed basis. Every&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                           Knowledge Management and Information Sharing: An Example from South Africa 9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          effort is also made to link "information communities" up with one another directly.&#13;
          The DLIST "pool of knowledge" can be presented as a circle (the "pool") with two-&#13;
          way arrows leading into it from "knowledge communities" or "informants" (Figure&#13;
          4). In addition to those knowledge communities represented in Figure 4, numerous&#13;
          additional informants contribute to DLIST on a regular basis including government&#13;
          departments, development agencies and programs, CBOs and private individuals.&#13;
          Each informant thus contributes to knowledge sharing. DLIST is likely to play an&#13;
          increasingly useful role to bring emerging large-scale development and planning&#13;
          initiatives together.&#13;

DLIST recognizes that coastal management is, to a large extent, a political process&#13;
that involves a number of key actors and interest groups in addition to government.&#13;
These coastal stakeholders and groups have varying perspectives on coastal&#13;
management and coastal management decisions often result from the interplay&#13;
between these different groups [Reference 10]. Decisions tend to be based on&#13;
available information. The issue therefore arises as to who maintains control of the&#13;
information on DLIST. For DLIST to be an "honest broker" it must promote&#13;
transparency and provide open access to information resources, while operating&#13;
independently from political processes or development agendas set by powerful role&#13;
players. The problem of information control is partly overcome by providing different&#13;
parties with the opportunity to manage the content of their own "information kiosks"&#13;
attached to the DLIST information platform. Furthermore, the DLIST platform is&#13;
designed to support bulletin boards and discussion forums, to which any party can&#13;
contribute. At the grassroots level, DLIST-related information is disseminated to the&#13;
broader public through a local government newspaper and supported donor agencies&#13;
and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
By facilitating information sharing, DLIST also acts as an agent of transformation. It&#13;
enables a dynamic collective voice at the local level to be heard, as well as those of&#13;
partners who support sustainable development. The input of DLIST into the Global&#13;
Conference on Oceans and Coasts at Rio + 10 therefore represents more than&#13;
government, academic or expert opinion but also the people who are most affected by&#13;
coastal development. DLIST's inclusive approach and close affinity with the planning&#13;
processes in the region also makes it an excellent planning tool. In contrast to other&#13;
internet-based tools such as government websites or university level distance learning&#13;
courses, substantial value is placed through DLIST on knowledge and information&#13;
held by local partners and communities. Such knowledge helps to define the context&#13;
of development in the region, and can thus be very useful to donors, government and&#13;
other agencies that have a role in promoting sustainable development in the region.&#13;
Most importantly, the flow of information through DLIST significantly influences the&#13;
imbalance that exists between those who have knowledge and those who do not.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   5. The Road beyond Johannesburg 2002&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge management is a fast growing field. Its power in achieving higher&#13;
sustainability in regional development has yet to be measured conclusively. The&#13;
deployment of DLIST to facilitate the regional conversion from a disaster prone&#13;
baseline to a sustainable situation through information sharing and KM has already&#13;
yielded several "lessons learned" that have strong relevance for the World Summit on&#13;
Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 2002 and for implementing its&#13;
recommendations and targets:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                     Knowledge Management and Information Sharing: An Example from South Africa 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a) The growing emphasis placed on the role of KM by the World Bank and other&#13;
    institutions is encouraging. However, knowledge is greatly influenced by the&#13;
    underlying information. Therefore, every effort should be made to incorporate&#13;
    knowledge from the "end users" of natural resources and particularly from those&#13;
    who will be most affected by local and regional planning and implementation.&#13;
    Information should come from a variety of sources, including specialist studies,&#13;
    and processed with sustainable outcomes as a goal. KM should not take place afar,&#13;
    rather, mechanisms should be established to decentralize KM to sub-national&#13;
    levels.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Despite good intentions, planning still occurs in many parts of the developing&#13;
    world in a "top down" manner. This presents difficulties in forming the strong&#13;
    partnerships between agencies at different levels that are necessary for sustainable&#13;
    development. Effective KM can facilitate the harmonization of divergent planning&#13;
    and development initiatives in a region, particularly where an integrated&#13;
    development planning system is still in progress. The "collective consciousness"&#13;
    can be far more effective in moving a region toward sustainability than documents&#13;
    that are inaccessible to all but a few, or may be out of context and difficult to&#13;
    implement. KM tools should therefore be made available at the sub-national levels&#13;
    to organizations, local government and other agencies that have a strong role to&#13;
    play in sustainable development.&#13;
&#13;
(c) Poverty alleviation initiatives are more likely to attain their objectives if they are&#13;
    placed in an integrated development framework. Where such a framework is not&#13;
    clearly delineated, as is often the case in developing regions, knowledge&#13;
    management can assist program managers and local people to identify and agree&#13;
    upon emerging frameworks. Thus the ad hoc placement of projects is avoided&#13;
    while synergetic links are more rapidly established. The implementation of&#13;
    poverty alleviation initiatives should therefore be linked as far as possible to&#13;
    "knowledge pools" that value local needs and knowledge, and feed lessons&#13;
    learned back into the common knowledge pool in an iterative manner.&#13;
&#13;
(d) Effective management of coastal resources requires rational and informed use of&#13;
    resources by coastal inhabitants and other role players. Information exchange&#13;
    should therefore begin at the earliest possible stages in the life-long learning&#13;
    process. CoastCare and other poverty alleviation projects in the region have&#13;
    proven to be effective instruments for environmental education and literacy&#13;
    training. As in many other developing regions, illiteracy represents a significant&#13;
    constraint to development along the West Coast of South Africa. Ninety-five&#13;
    percent of the participants in the northern Cape CoastCare program were&#13;
    functionally illiterate and as a result were extremely vulnerable. Truly sustainable&#13;
    development cannot be achieved unless these issues are addressed. Basic&#13;
    education should not be the sole responsibility of education departments. Coastal&#13;
    poverty alleviation and development programs and facilities should be utilized to&#13;
    overcome illiteracy at every opportunity. Natural resource management should&#13;
    therefore be embedded in Further Education Training (FET) at secondary school&#13;
    level and environmental education should be infused into all levels of schooling.&#13;
&#13;
(e) Large industries such as the mining houses possess enormous capacity to facilitate&#13;
    sustainable development. Such industries should be encouraged to engage in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     12 Rejoice Mabudafhasi&#13;
&#13;
    integrated development planning from a regional perspective, and contribute in&#13;
    terms of infrastructure, knowledge dissemination and technical expertise.&#13;
&#13;
(f) Environmental rehabilitation is desperately lacking in the transfrontier region.&#13;
    Despite an array of enabling legislation, regulations are often not enforced and&#13;
    environmental degradation continues with impunity. The lesson emerging here is&#13;
    that Environmental Assessment (EA) capacity should be strengthened locally, for&#13;
    instance at the local government and CBO level. Through KM local role players&#13;
    can be effectively linked into supporting structures such as legal assistance centers&#13;
    and Multi-Purpose resource centers to prevent further environmental damage.&#13;
&#13;
It is worth noting that DLIST fits very well into the priority framework outlined by&#13;
the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) which is a pledge by&#13;
African leaders to eradicate poverty and place their countries on a path of sustainable&#13;
growth and development. Access to information and KM in the interest of sustainable&#13;
development will play a pivotal role in extricating the continent from the malaise of&#13;
underdevelopment and exclusion in a globalizing world [Reference 11]. DLIST could&#13;
also contribute to the African Process for Promoting Sustainable Development of the&#13;
Marine and Coastal Environment, to ensure local ownership and participation.&#13;
Finally, however, the responsibility of ensuring the continued operation and&#13;
effectiveness of a mechanism like DLIST lies with its users at ground level and their&#13;
partners that believe information sharing is pivotal to equitable development.&#13;

    DLIST is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through IW:LEARN,&#13;
    a Washington-based NGO. It is one of two global KM pilots for coastal regions.&#13;
    The task manager of DLIST at the World Bank, Mr. Andy Hooten&#13;
    (ahooten@worldbank.org) is responsible for assessing the success of the pilot&#13;
    project.&#13;

(4) The DLIST "pool of knowledge" has drawn from many sources, briefly described&#13;
    they include:&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The Integrated Development Planning (IDP) process contributed a vast&#13;
        amount of information on the region, including a situational analysis, a Vision&#13;
        for the Richtersveld, development priorities and local knowledge. The DLIST&#13;
        "pool of knowledge" obviously informs the IDP in return. The IDP is&#13;
        conducted under the auspices of the local government.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The Richtersveld Youth Forum held a Richtersveld Youth Summit in 2001 to&#13;
        determine the needs, observations and aspirations of the Youth, and to clarify&#13;
        their role in sustainable development of the region. The Youth Summit was&#13;
        organized by Connected Cultures and involved learners from Connecticut and&#13;
        Richtersveld..&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The Multi-Purpose Resource Centers (MPRCs) in Hondeklipbaai and&#13;
        Sizamile, Port Nolloth have produced useful information on their areas. These&#13;
        centers are hubs for training and computer access, and play a watchdog role&#13;
        for the area at the local level. They contribute useful "lessons learned" during&#13;
        the implementation of projects and are increasingly utilized by members of&#13;

· The DEA&amp;T's cluster of poverty alleviation projects include among others,&#13;
  tourism infrastructure projects, waste management projects, tourism facilities,&#13;
  and a succulent nursery. The success rate for Richtersveld projects are high&#13;
  (over 80 percent) due to local level identification of the projects that are&#13;
  incorporated into appropriate existing planning frameworks.&#13;
&#13;
· The Richtersveld Tourism Association (RTA) informs tourism development&#13;
  through the Vision and Mission of its members and its proposed action plan&#13;
  for the year.&#13;
&#13;
· The Succulent Karoo Ecosystem Plan (SKEP) represents a broad-based&#13;
  planning process facilitated by Conservation International. It aims to preserve&#13;
  the Succulent Karoo biome through an inclusive planning process that&#13;
  incorporates both the interests of conservation and the "end user"&#13;
  communities.&#13;
&#13;
· The TRANSFORM program is a partnership between GTZ and the DEA&amp;T&#13;
  operating in the Richtersveld in community-based resource management,&#13;
  capacity building in protected areas and integrated planning.&#13;
&#13;
· DEA&amp;T's CoastCare program contributes to KM in a variety of ways,&#13;
  including monitoring of coastal activities, raising environmental awareness,&#13;
  providing input into Agenda 21 status of the Northern Cape coastline and&#13;
  identifying viable livelihood projects.&#13;
&#13;
· The Richtersveld NORAD program is particularly concerned with the&#13;
  compilation of indigenous knowledge and the preservation and sustainable&#13;
  utilization of cultural heritage. The program will be the main driver in a&#13;
  process leading to the declaration of the Richtersveld as a World Heritage Site&#13;
  (WHS).&#13;
&#13;
· The Fishing and Mariculture Development Association (FAMDA) has the task&#13;
  of developing the fishing and mariculture industry in the Northern Cape in a&#13;
  sustainable and equitable manner. Activities include awareness raising,&#13;
  facilitating quota applications, fund-raising and development of a sector plan&#13;
  for the development of the industry in the Northern Cape.&#13;
&#13;
· The Integrated Conservation and Development Planning Workshop held in&#13;
  Alexander Bay on 2-3 April 2001, an initiative of the DEA&amp;T, was facilitated&#13;
  by the DLIST team. Additional contributors included Conservation&#13;
  International GTZ/TRANSFORM and the Peace Parks Foundation (PPF). The&#13;
  workshop contributed tremendously through information sharing and&#13;
  strengthening of collaborative partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
· Transfrontier meetings concerning the management of the Orange River&#13;
  Mouth TFCA and the Richtersveld Ais-ais Transfrontier Park are becoming&#13;
  more inclusive in terms of community representation and informing the&#13;
  Integrated Development Plan (IDP) and the broader regional planning&#13;
  context.&#13;

            The role of knowledge management and
            information sharing in capacity building for sustainable
            development : an example from South Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper investigates the role of
            knowledge management and information sharing in facilitating
            integrated development planning in the coastal areas of the
            Northern Cape, South Africa, and the trans-frontier region
            with Namibia. The paper describes how the Distance Learning
            and Information Sharing Tool (DLIST), a Global Environment
            Facility (GEF) funded IWLEARN pilot project, is attempting
            to aid a collective approach to sustainable development. As
            DLIST works on the principle of information gathering from a
            wide range of sources, lessons learned from current
            initiatives are discussed briefly and recommendations are
            made for the World Summit for Sustainable Development in
            Johannesburg 2002.
