FOREWORD&#13;
Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s rapid economic growth in the last two decades has been accompanied by increased levels of&#13;
urbanisation. Our cities, which are engines of growth, are under great strain to meet the growing&#13;
demands and aspirations of their people.&#13;
&#13;
Recognising the growing importance of improving efficiency in delivery of basic services in our cities, the&#13;
Government of India has launched a series of initiatives aimed at enabling urban local bodies to meet the&#13;
unprecedented challenges that they face today. These include schemes such as the Jawaharlal Nehru&#13;
National Urban Renewal Mission, Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium&#13;
Towns, Capacity Building for Urban Local Bodies, National Urban Transport Policy, National Urban&#13;
Sanitation Policy, National Mission Mode Project on E-governance and credit rating of select&#13;
municipal bodies.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the ongoing endeavour to facilitate critical reforms in the urban sector, the Ministry of Urban&#13;
Development has now adopted National Benchmarks in four key sectorsâ&#128;&#148;Water Supply, Sewerage, Solid&#13;
Waste Management and Storm Water Drainage. Investments in urban infrastructure have, however, not&#13;
always resulted in corresponding improvements in levels of service delivery. There is, therefore, a need&#13;
for a shift in focus towards service delivery. This is especially the case in water supply and sanitation.&#13;
It is hoped that the Handbook of Service Delivery Benchmarking developed by the Ministry of Urban&#13;
Development through a consultative process shall provide a standardised framework for performance&#13;
monitoring in respect to water supply, sewerage, solid waste management services and storm water&#13;
drainage, and would enable State level agencies and local level service providers to initiate a process of&#13;
performance monitoring and evaluation against agreed targets, finally resulting in the achievement of&#13;
service level benchmarks identified in the Handbook.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Urban Development would facilitate the adoption of these benchmarks through its various&#13;
schemes and would also provide appropriate support to municipalities that move towards the adoption of&#13;
these benchmarks. I encourage all State and local level functionaries to use this Handbook in achieving&#13;
our shared goal of improved service delivery for our citizens.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
The Ministry of Urban Development initiated an exercise to develop standardised service level benchmarks&#13;
with respect to basic municipal services in the year 2006. Subsequently, a core group comprising the&#13;
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), the Public Record of Operations and Finance (PROOF),&#13;
the Water and Sanitation Programâ&#128;&#147;South Asia (WSPâ&#128;&#147;SA) and Municipal Commissioners of Pune,&#13;
Bangalore, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Kolkata was constituted by the Ministry of Urban Development, which&#13;
developed a draft Handbook of Service Level Benchmarking that was circulated among all the States and&#13;
other key stakeholders. Based on the comments received, the draft was revised and a National Level&#13;
Workshop was held in July 2008 for the adoption of benchmarks with respect to basic municipal services&#13;
related to water supply, sewerage, solid waste management and storm water drainage.&#13;
&#13;
This Handbook is a result of work done over a period of about two years and is designed to enable the&#13;
systematic and sustained monitoring of services using standardised indicators against agreed targets and&#13;
benchmarks. It will help effect performance improvements in the identified service sectors by (i) helping&#13;
local decision-makers identify gaps, plan and prioritise improvement measures; (ii) enabling the&#13;
identification and transfer of best practice; (iii) enhancing accountability to customers for service delivery&#13;
levels; (iv) providing a framework that can underlie contracts/agreements with service providers; and&#13;
(v) making it possible to link decision-making on financial allocations to service outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
It is expected that State governments and cities would adopt this performance monitoring framework at&#13;
the Urban Local Body (ULB)/parastatal level, and undertake to regularly collate and analyse the&#13;
performance data to improve the quality of the decision-making process in the sectors identified in this&#13;
Handbook. Its adoption by all States shall facilitate uniform measurements and reporting systems, which&#13;
will be of immense help to the management of the service utilities in making the right comparisons aimed&#13;
at improving the efficiency of the infrastructure. It shall also be of great help in shifting the focus from&#13;
infrastructure to service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
I would like to sincerely thank all the persons associated with this exercise, especially all the State&#13;
Government Secretaries of Urban Development, Municipal Commissioners, WSPâ&#128;&#147;SA, CRISIL, PROOF             , ICAI&#13;
and Technical Cell (Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission [JNNURM]) in the preparation of&#13;
this Handbook. I am also grateful for the support received from the Secretary, Urban Development,&#13;
Dr. M. Ramachandran, who has been the driving force behind this exercise. I indeed hope that this&#13;
Handbook would mark a watershed in the urban sector.&#13;

     sector. Similarly, in the urban sector too, there have&#13;
     been a number of performance indicators related          a Most performance measurement initiatives have&#13;

     However, most initiatives in performance&#13;
     management so far have been observed to have             a The process of performance measurement&#13;
     some key limitations:                                    has not been taken forward into performance&#13;

Measuring service levels of civic agencies implies    Benchmarking,â&#128;&#153; comprising experts from various&#13;
measuring outcomes, and indirectly also reflects on   institutions to arrive at the SLBs. Drawing on the&#13;
institutional capacity, financial performance and     experiences of various initiatives in measuring&#13;
other parameters. Service level parameters can be     service level performance, the Core Group&#13;
measured either from a utility managerâ&#128;&#153;s/plannerâ&#128;&#153;s    narrowed down the exercise to four basic urban&#13;

perspective. In addition, to facilitate comparison    indicators in each. After much deliberation,&#13;
between cities/service delivery jurisdictions, and    the indicators, their definitions, means of&#13;
changes in performance over time, it is important     measurement, frequency and jurisdiction of&#13;
that the performance levels are benchmarked, and      measurement and reporting, etc., were finalised.&#13;
monitored against those benchmarks.&#13;

     These parameters have been defined primarily&#13;
                                                             Administrative jurisdictions for service delivery&#13;

     In other words, the parameters highlight the&#13;

     agencies themselves, reported to higher levels of       on the other hand, in case of network utilities such as&#13;
     management and also disseminated widely.                water supply and sewage, all network management&#13;

     Performance from a citizenâ&#128;&#153;s or consumerâ&#128;&#153;s point of&#13;
     view is better measured by capturing their              It will therefore be relevant to examine â&#128;&#152;network&#13;
     perception, rather than data from the delivery          managementâ&#128;&#153;-related performance indicators by&#13;
     agency. Measuring citizensâ&#128;&#153; perception can be           Zone/sub-jurisdictions of the network (for example,&#13;
     supplemented by reporting by the agencies               continuity of water supply), while service delivery as&#13;
     themselves, and can offer interesting insights when     experienced by the citizen is measured by civic wards&#13;
     compared with one another.                              as the smallest jurisdiction (for example, coverage of&#13;
                                                             water supply connections).&#13;
     Performance parameters should be applied across&#13;
     all cities and regularly used by all stakeholders.      For purposes of internal management of the&#13;
     Practical considerations will drive frequency of        ULB/utility, performance should be reported at the&#13;
     measurement and reporting; and the jurisdiction of      lowest level of jurisdiction and at maximum&#13;
     measurement and reporting, both critical aspects in     frequency possible. However, frequency may&#13;

     to be measured at a frequency higher than or at         reported to the higher levels of government and&#13;
     least equal to the frequency at which it will need to   other external stakeholders.&#13;

  institutionalised through the Jawaharlal Nehru        inter-city comparisons. These departments&#13;
  National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM)               should leverage the power of information&#13;

  performance is to be measured, and definition             measurement of the performance indicator&#13;
  for the indicator is provided;                            refers to the frequency at which the performance&#13;
                                                            level will be assessed and not the frequency at&#13;
a Data requirements: The specific elements of               which the data elements will be measured. For&#13;
  data that need to be captured are identified,             each indicator, the minimum frequency at which&#13;
  along with the corresponding unit of                      the performance should be measured is&#13;
  measurement. Each data element is described,              mentioned. It can then be reported at the same&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
The minimum level acceptable standard for water supply service should be a household level water&#13;
supply connection, that is, a direct piped connection for water supply within the household. Water&#13;
provision to households (urban poor or otherwise), at common public standposts cannot be&#13;
considered as an acceptable/long-term permanent service provision standard. The social costs of not&#13;
having access to a piped water connection at the household level are significant. Innovative service&#13;
delivery options may be adopted for delivery of piped water connections to properties with&#13;
inappropriate tenure rights (as in many urban slums). It is therefore important to measure this&#13;
performance indicator, the benchmark value for which should be 100 percent.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
This frequently used performance indicator provides an overall indication of the adequacy of the&#13;
water supply to meet the needs of the citizens in the city. Per capita water supplied, expressed in lpcd,&#13;
indicates the adequacy of the municipal water supply system in being able to source, treat water to&#13;
potable standards and supply it into the distribution system. Therefore, this indicator should be&#13;
periodically measured and monitored. Monitoring this on a monthly basis will reveal seasonal&#13;
variations. The benchmark value for this indicator is 135 lpcd. However, the additional information in&#13;
respect of the areas where water is supplied at the rate of 70 lpcd should also be indicated. The key&#13;
limitation of this indicator is that it provides information on a city-wide basis, and does not reveal&#13;
intra-city variations.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
While water is a basic need, the supply of potable water to citizens at their doorstep involves&#13;
significant costs in building, operating and maintaining a system to do so. In a water supply system,&#13;
the quantum of service provided to citizens is directly measurable, and therefore it is necessary that&#13;
all the water supplied to all categories of consumers should be metered. Metering will also induce&#13;
efficiency in use of water, reveal physical and administrative leakages in the system, and enable&#13;
high-end consumers to be charged for consuming more. Therefore, to introduce a volumetric-based&#13;
tariff structure for water charges, metering all connections is essential. It is, therefore, important to&#13;
monitor this indicator, the benchmark value for which is 100 percent.&#13;

Lowest level of reliability (D)   A few meters have been installed. All installed meters are assumed to&#13;
                                  be functional and used as the basis for billing water charges.&#13;

Intermediate level (C)            Meters are installed for only certain categories of consumers. It is&#13;

                                  which are functional and used as the basis for billing. Records&#13;
                                  do not reveal the exact number of connections which are metered.&#13;
                                  Water is charged on the basis of average readings for the consumer&#13;
                                  category or on the basis of past trends in most cases.&#13;
&#13;
Intermediate level (B)            Databases/records reveal the list of consumers that have meters&#13;
                                  installed in their water connections. However, there are no clear data&#13;
                                  on functioning of meters, and no linkage with the billing system that&#13;
                                  may or may not use metered quantity as the basis for billing.&#13;

                                  consumers. Records on standposts are available. Databases of water&#13;
                                  connections and meters are complete, and spatially referenced with a&#13;
                                  geographic information system (GIS) database. There is a mechanism&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
The reduction in NRW to acceptable levels is vital for the financial sustainability of the water utility.&#13;
NRW can be reduced through appropriate technical and managerial actions, and therefore&#13;
monitoring NRW can trigger such corrective measures. The reduction of real losses can be used to&#13;
meet currently unsatisfied demand or to defer future capital expenditures to provide additional supply&#13;
capacity. The reduction of NRW is desirable not just from a financial standpoint, but also from the&#13;
economic and environmental benefitsâ&#128;&#153; point of view. The benchmark value for NRW may be&#13;
considered at 20 percent, the levels achieved by most well-performing utilities in developed countries.&#13;
NRW is also influenced by factors outside the control of the water utility such as the topography of the&#13;
city, age of the network, length of the network per connection and water use per capita.&#13;

developed world. From a citizenâ&#128;&#153;s perspective, it is desirable to have round-the-clock water supply&#13;
daily, as it eliminates the need to provide and manage household/establishment level storage, and&#13;
other resultant inconveniences. Water utilities in most Indian cities provide intermittent and limited&#13;
number of hours of supply, as a means to manage inadequate supply. A number of studies have&#13;
demonstrated the negative fallouts of designing and operating a system for intermittent water supply.&#13;
A number of cities are undertaking substantial investments to improve this service level. It is,&#13;
therefore, critical to monitor this indicator on a city-wide basis and move towards the benchmark&#13;
value of 24 hours.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
The quality of water supplied is as important a performance indicator as other service delivery&#13;
indicators. Poor water quality can pose serious public health hazards. Water-borne diseases are quite&#13;
common in Indian cities, particularly among the urban poor. Although, in most cases, the source of&#13;
water that causes such diseases/epidemics is not the municipal piped water supply, it is very&#13;
important to monitor the supply. Therefore, this performance indicator must be regularly monitored,&#13;
the benchmark value for which is 100 percent.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
It is important that, in essential services such as water supply, the ULB/water utility has effective&#13;
systems to capture customer complaints/grievances, escalate them internally for remedial action and&#13;
resolve them. While many ULBs/utilities have put in place systems to capture complaints, much more&#13;
work needs to be done to put in place back-end systems for satisfactory resolution of those&#13;
complaints on time. As water supply is an essential service, the benchmark time for redressal is&#13;
24 hours or the next working day. It is, therefore, important to monitor this indicator. The benchmark&#13;
value for this indicator will depend on a number of factors such as the size of the city, age of the&#13;
network, etc. The benchmark value for this indicator may be set at 80 percent.&#13;

                                  tracking the complaints. Data available for some months have been&#13;
                                  used as a trend to report the figures for some other months.&#13;

received by the consumers are more direct and can be quantified. Therefore, through a combination&#13;
of user charges, fees and taxes, all operating costs may be recovered. Therefore, this indicator is&#13;
critical for measuring overall cost recovery, the benchmark value for which is 100 percent. Cost&#13;
recovery objectives provide a basis for tariff fixation, enable setting targets for revenue mobilisation&#13;
and cost control in the delivery of water supply services.&#13;

                                  complete segregation is not practiced (for example, electricity&#13;
                                  costs for water supply services are not segregated from overall&#13;
                                  electricity costs of the ULB). Key income and expenditure are&#13;
                                  recognised based on accrual principles. Disclosures are complete&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
For a water utility, it is not just enough to have an appropriate tariff structure that enables cost&#13;
recovery objectives but also efficient collection of revenues that are due to the utility. It is also&#13;
important that the revenues are collected in the same financial year, without allowing for dues to get&#13;
accumulated as arrears. It is, therefore, critical to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for&#13;
collection efficiency may be considered at 90 percent, since it is possible that about 10 percent of the&#13;
dues may be delayed to the next year.&#13;

                                  the specific bill issued. Overall accrual principles of accounting are&#13;
                                  followed, and therefore deposits and advances are not included in&#13;
                                  income and expenditure, respectively.&#13;

Highest/preferred level of        Collection records are maintained for each billing cycle. Collections&#13;

Last mile access to toilets is key to improvement in service levels of sanitation facilities. In many Indian&#13;
cities, there is inadequate access to toilet facilities. Therefore, it is important to measure this&#13;
parameter. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent. Substantial investment in this area&#13;
is being taken up under the Basic Services to the Urban Poor (BSUP) component of JNNURM as well&#13;
as the Integrated Low Cost Sanitation (ILCS) scheme.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
Last mile access to sewage networks is key to improvement in service levels of sewage management.&#13;
In many Indian cities, sewage also flows through open drains/storm water drains, posing serious&#13;
public health hazards. Also, the coverage of sewage network services is very low across most Indian&#13;
cities. With substantial investments in this area being taken up in programmes such as JNNURM, it&#13;
would be important to monitor this indicator to observe the impact being made on the ground.&#13;
Therefore, it is important to measure this parameter. Its benchmark value is 100 percent.&#13;

&#13;
                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
While the performance indicator for coverage provides an idea of infrastructure available for access&#13;
to sewage networks, the effectiveness of the system in capturing the sewage may not be adequate.&#13;
Therefore, the performance indicator related to collection efficiency signifies the effectiveness of the&#13;
network in capturing and conveying it to the treatment plants. Thus, it is not just adequate to have an&#13;
effective network that collects sewage, but also one that treats the sewage at the end of the network.&#13;
The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
Most Indian cities have inadequate capacity for treatment of sewage that is generated in their cities.&#13;
Significant investments are under way in creating such capacities through programmes such as&#13;
JNNURM. This indicator will highlight the adequacy of available and operational sewage treatment&#13;
capacity. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent.&#13;

For sustainable sewage management, it is not just enough to have the infrastructure to collect and&#13;
convey the sewage, or the installed capacity to treat it. It is important that the treated water that is&#13;
discharged back into water bodies, or used for other purposes such as irrigation, meets the laid&#13;
down environmental standards. It is therefore important to monitor this indicator. Its benchmark&#13;
value is 100 percent.&#13;

For sustainable water management, it is desirable that sewage is recycled or reused after&#13;
appropriate treatment. Effluent water can be directly reused in a number of areas such as used in&#13;
parks and gardens, supplied for irrigation purposes for farmland on the city periphery, etc. To&#13;
maximise this reuse, it is important that this indicator is measured and monitored. Its benchmark&#13;
could be 20 percent.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
It is important that in essential services such as sewage, the utility has effective systems to capture&#13;
customer complaints/grievances, escalate them internally for remedial action and resolve them.&#13;
While many ULBs/utilities have put in place systems to capture complaints, much more work needs to&#13;
be done to put in place back-end systems for satisfactorily resolving those complaints on time. As&#13;
sewage treatment is an essential service, the benchmark time for redressal is 24 hours or the next&#13;
working day. It is therefore important to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for this indicator&#13;
will depend on a number of factors such as the size of the city, age of the network, etc. The&#13;
benchmark value for this indicator may be set at 80 percent.&#13;

                                  tracking the complaints. Data available for some months have been&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
Financial sustainability is a critical factor for all basic urban services. In services such as sewerage&#13;
management, some benefits are received directly by the consumers, and some benefits accrue&#13;
indirectly through a sustainable environment and public health benefits. Therefore, through a&#13;
combination of user charges, fees and taxes, all operating costs may be recovered. Therefore, the&#13;
indicator is critical for measuring overall cost recovery, the benchmark value for which is 100 percent.&#13;

                                  system is practiced. There are no clear systems for reporting unpaid&#13;
                                  expenditure. Disclosures and reporting are not timely. Audits have a&#13;

                                  practiced. Key income and expenditure are recognised, based on&#13;
                                  accrual principles. Disclosures are complete and on time.&#13;

Highest/preferred level           In case of multi-function agencies such as municipal corporations,&#13;

     the indicator&#13;
&#13;
     a. Current revenues collected         Rs crore Revenues collected for bills raised during the year.&#13;
     in the given year                    per annum This should exclude collection of arrears as&#13;
                                                    inclusion of arrears will skew the performance&#13;
                                                    reflected. Collection efficiency is in fact an&#13;
                                                    indicator of how many arrears are being built up,&#13;
                                                    and therefore only current revenues should&#13;
                                                    be considered.&#13;

                                                    include revenues from all sources related to sewage&#13;

&#13;
                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
For a utility, it is not just enough to have an appropriate tariff structure that enables cost recovery&#13;
objectives, but also efficient collection of revenues that are due to the utility. It is also important that&#13;
the revenues are collected in the same financial year, without allowing for dues to get accumulated as&#13;
arrears. It is therefore critical to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for collection efficiency&#13;
may be considered at 90 percent, since it is possible that about 10 percent of the dues may be&#13;
delayed to the next year.&#13;

                                  collection. A cash basis of accounting is followed. The accounting&#13;
                                  code structure does not enable clear segregation of&#13;
                                  water revenues.&#13;
&#13;
Intermediate level (C)            Not applicable.&#13;
&#13;
Intermediate level (B)            There is a clear segregation of current year revenues collection versus&#13;
                                  arrears collection. However, revenue collection is not matched against&#13;
                                  the specific bill issued. Overall accrual principles of accounting are&#13;
                                  followed, and therefore deposits and advances are not included in&#13;
                                  income and expenditure, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
Highest/preferred level           Collection records are maintained for each billing cycle. Collections&#13;
of reliability (A)                are clearly identified against the specific bill which has been issued.&#13;

&#13;
This indicator provides the coverage of door-to-door solid waste collection services. Doorstep level&#13;
collection is an essential and critical starting point in the entire chain of scientific SWM services.&#13;
Waste-free clean roads and drains, scientific treatment of waste so as to maximise treatment,&#13;
recycling and disposal can all be achieved in a sustainable manner only if door-to-door collection of&#13;
waste is sustained. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent.&#13;

Intermediate level (C)            Coverage is estimated on the basis of the number of wards serviced&#13;
                                  by doorstep collection, as a percentage of the total number of wards&#13;
                                  in the ULB.&#13;
&#13;
Intermediate level (B)            Estimation of coverage is based on the average daily waste collected&#13;
                                  by the ULB (in tonnes) from areas serviced by doorstep waste&#13;
                                  collection, divided by the estimated daily waste generation (in&#13;
                                  tonnes) by the entire city. Daily averages are based on the actual&#13;
                                  weighing of the waste collected on designated weighbridges,&#13;
                                  measured daily for seven consecutive days in a month.&#13;
&#13;
Highest/preferred level           Calculation is based on the actual number of households and&#13;

                                  records of user charges collected for the doorstep collection services.&#13;
                                  The total number of households/establishments should be measured&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
This indicator is relatively easy to measure, and has been used for a long time as an indicator of&#13;
efficiency in collection of waste. While the indicator is well understood, the reliability varies&#13;
significantly on account of different methods used for measurement. Collection efficiency should&#13;
measure waste collected in the normal course by SWM systems. Typically, the uncollected waste tends&#13;
to gradually find its way into recycling, or is strewn along the roads, clogs the drains or in case of&#13;
bio-degradable waste, putrefies and degrades. Therefore, collection efficiency is a key performance&#13;
indicator. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent.&#13;

                                                    in the following categories: bio-degradable waste,&#13;

&#13;
                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
Segregation of waste is a critical requirement for sustainable SWM systems. Segregation enables&#13;
recycling, reuse, treatment and scientific disposal of the different components of waste. Segregation&#13;
of waste should ideally be at source, and should then also be transported in a segregated manner up&#13;
to the point of treatment and/or disposal. If waste is received at these points in a segregated manner,&#13;
it can be safely assumed that it has been segregated at source and transported so, while the converse&#13;
may not be true. Therefore, segregation is being measured at this point of receipt, rather than at the&#13;
point of collection. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent. In cases where the ULB is&#13;
adopting an integrated approach with various options for waste treatment where segregation is also&#13;
taken care of, compliance with this provision may not be mandatory.&#13;

Lowest level of reliability (D)   Segregation is estimated by the service provider without any&#13;
                                  documentation of measurement methods adopted.&#13;
&#13;
Intermediate level (C)            All households and establishments provided two separate waste&#13;
                                  containers are assumed to be â&#128;&#152;segregatingâ&#128;&#153; waste. Then the&#13;
                                  percentage of households provided with two bins is used as the&#13;
                                  basis for estimating the extent of segregation.&#13;
&#13;
Intermediate level (B)            Estimates of segregation are based on the input from agencies&#13;
                                  engaged in doorstep collection. The aggregates of estimates across all&#13;
                                  areas should be added up for the ULB-wide estimate.&#13;
&#13;
Highest/preferred level           The daily total of waste arriving in a segregated manner at disposal/&#13;
of reliability (A)                treatment sites should be measured, on the basis of weighing of&#13;
                                  individual trips. Waste taken away by recyclers from intermediate&#13;
                                  points should be added to this quantum, which can be assessed from&#13;
                                  wholesale waste recycling traders (kabadiwalas).&#13;
&#13;
                                  Alternately, the quantum of unsegregated waste received at the&#13;
                                  disposal point, that is, the composting yard, landfill site, or dump site,&#13;
                                  should be measured through regular weighing on a weighbridge.&#13;
                                  The daily totals should be arrived at by adding weights of all trips.&#13;
                                  The difference between the quantum collected and this quantum&#13;
                                  (unsegregated waste) should be equal to the quantity that&#13;
                                  is segregated.&#13;

                                  A daily log of waste intake at processing facilities is maintained, which&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
Environmental sustainability demands that the maximum amount of waste should be either recycled,&#13;
reused or processed. While the processing, recycling and reuse should be carried out without creating&#13;
any health and environmental hazards, the total quantum of waste recovered is in itself a key&#13;
performance parameter. Therefore, measurement of this indicator is critical. The benchmark value for&#13;
this indicator will depend on the amount of inert matter included in the waste collected by the ULB.&#13;
Waste composition is typically unique for each city, while being within a broad range of values for&#13;
similar cities. The benchmark value for this indicator could be 80 percent.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
Inert waste should finally be disposed at landfill sites, which are designed, built, operated and&#13;
maintained according to standards laid down in prevailing laws and manuals of nodal agencies. This&#13;
includes collection and treatment of leachate at the landfill site. The extent of compliance should be&#13;
evaluated against the total quantum of waste that is disposed at landfills. This is a critical&#13;
performance parameter from an environmental sustainability perspective. The benchmark value for&#13;
this indicator is 100 percent.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
It is important that in essential services such as SWM, the utility has effective systems to capture&#13;
customer complaints/grievances, escalate them internally for remedial action and resolve them.&#13;
While many ULBs/utilities have put in place systems to capture complaints, much more work needs to&#13;
be done to put in place back-end systems for satisfactorily resolving those complaints on time. As&#13;
SWM is an essential service, the benchmark time for redressal is 24 hours or the next working day. It&#13;
is therefore important to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for this indicator will depend on&#13;
a number of factors such as the size of the city, manpower, institutional network, etc. The benchmark&#13;
value for this indicator may be set at 80 percent.&#13;

                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
Financial sustainability is a critical factor for all basic urban services. In services such as SWM, some&#13;
benefits are received directly by the consumers while some other benefits accrue indirectly through a&#13;
cleaner and sustainable environment, apart from public health benefits. Therefore, costs related to&#13;
SWM may be recovered through a combination of taxes and user charges. In case of SWM, there is&#13;
potential to supplement user charges with revenues that can be gained from recycling, reuse and&#13;
conversion of waste to either compost or fuel or directly to energy. Therefore, it is critical for&#13;
measuring overall cost recovery. There is enough past precedence to reveal that the benchmark value&#13;
for cost recovery may be set at 100 percent.&#13;

     a. Current revenues collected         Rs crore   Revenues collected for bills raised during the year.&#13;
     in the given year                    per annum   This should exclude collection of arrears as&#13;

                                                      indicator of how many arrears are being built up,&#13;
                                                      and therefore only current revenues should&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Rationale for the Indicator&#13;
For a utility, it is not just enough to have an appropriate tariff structure that enables cost recovery&#13;
objectives, but also efficient collection of revenues that are due to the utility. It is also important that&#13;
the revenues are collected in the same financial year, without allowing for dues to get accumulated as&#13;
arrears. It is therefore critical to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for collection efficiency&#13;
may be considered at 90 percent, since it is possible that about 10 percent of the dues may be&#13;
delayed to the next year.&#13;

                                  arrears collection. However, revenue collection is not matched against&#13;
                                  the specific bill issued. Overall accrual principles of accounting are&#13;
                                  followed, and therefore deposits and advances are not included in&#13;
                                  income and expenditure, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
Highest/preferred level           Collection records are maintained for each billing cycle.&#13;

            Every sector has a few key performance
            indicators that are understood by most stakeholders in that
            sector. Similarly, in the urban sector too, there have been
            a number of performance indicators related to urban
            management and service delivery that have been defined,
            measured, and reported. Measuring service levels of civic
            agencies implies measuring outcomes, and indirectly also
            reflects on institutional capacity, financial performance,
            and other parameters. Service level parameters can be
            measured either from a utility manager’s or planner’s
            perspective or from a citizen’s or consumer’s perspective.
            It is in this context, that the Ministry of Urban
            Development (MoUD) has initiated an exercise to define
            service level benchmarks (SLBs). The handbook of service
            level benchmarking is a ready reckoner to enable urban local
            bodies (ULBs) and other city level parastatal agencies
            implement systems for measuring, reporting, and monitoring
            the SLBs.
