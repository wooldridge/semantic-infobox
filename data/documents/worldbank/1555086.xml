THE GLOBAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
This paper describes the main features of the global model system&#13;
used in preparing the-World Bank's World Development Report. 1979. The system&#13;
provides a quantitative-basis for the study of growth prospects in developing&#13;
countries in the context of the world economy, and has been used to make pro-&#13;
jections for the period 1975-90.   It is not a finished product, but part of&#13;
a continuing effort to improve the Bank's analytical methods. At present it&#13;
consists of three main modules linked via recursive iteration: (i) models of&#13;
economic activity in eleven developing "regions," together with sets of pro-&#13;
jections for industrialized countries, capital surplus oil exporting coun-&#13;
tries and centrally planned economies; (ii) a module describing international&#13;
trade flows and commodity prices; and (iii) a module describing the global&#13;
supply of various types of capital and their allocation among regions.&#13;
The models for developing regions are dynamic optimizing models&#13;
in the tradition of economy-wide planning models. Aggregate output of the&#13;
region in question is maximized subject to constraints imposed by technology,&#13;
behavior, domestic policy choices and the international economic environment.&#13;
The model specifications are given in an Appendix.&#13;

I. AN OVERVIEW&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.        This paper describes the main features of the global analytical&#13;
framework underlying various parts of the World Bank's World Development&#13;
Report, 1979. 1/ The World Development Report (WDR) is designed to help&#13;
clarify some of the linkages between the international economy and domestic&#13;
strategies in the developing countries, against the background of increasing&#13;
complexity in the world economy. To provide a quantitative basis for the&#13;
study, a global economic model has been constructed whose purpose is to pro-&#13;
ject the growth of various groups of countries and to display various pos-&#13;
sible interrelationships among them, through international trade and capital&#13;
flows.&#13;
2.        Interest in the use of a global analytical framework for policy&#13;
work within the Bank has arisen for several reasons. Firstly, because of&#13;
the multiplicity of interdependent influences on growth and development in&#13;
the developing countries-with no particular influence dominant--one cannot&#13;
readily examine the probable impact on these economies of specific changes&#13;
in, say, international trade or capital flows. A second, and related point,&#13;
is the fact that the international economy is growing more interdependent;&#13;
a global analytical framework can contribute to an understanding of the nature&#13;
of this interdependence and to adjustments that may need to be undertaken in&#13;
developing and developed countries alike. Third, there has been a growing&#13;
need to ensure consistency in projections of global trade and capital accounts&#13;
in various elements of policy work within the Bank.&#13;
3.        The present model should be seen not as a finished product but as&#13;
part of the Bank's continuing efforts to improve its analytical methods. It&#13;
is not the Bank's first attempt to use an analytical framework for global&#13;
analysis. Between 1974 and 1977, annual studies of the "Prospects for Devel-&#13;
oping Countries" were prepared for use within the Bank; the analysis in these&#13;
studies was underpinned by economic models for a sample panel of some 40 devel-&#13;
oping countries, and by a simple global model called SIMLINK. 2/ The former&#13;
are essentially trade-gap models in the tradition of those developed by Chenery&#13;
and Strout, 3/ with an enlarged treatment of loan flows and debt service. The&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SIMLINK model extended the concepts of trade-gap models into a rudimentary&#13;
global framework, which contained a large number of exogenous variables and&#13;
had only a minimal number of links among country groups. SIMLINK did not&#13;
include global trade accounts, had little separation of trade categories,&#13;
and only rudimentary relationships between foreign capital availabilities&#13;
and the output of developing countries. Since it was originally designed to&#13;
study the medium-term effects of the commodity price increases that occurred&#13;
in 1972-73, the model was built on the premise that the growth of developing&#13;
countries was constrained principally by foreign exchange availabilities.&#13;
With the passage of time, there is growing evidence to the contrary for many&#13;
of these countries. These considerations, together with a need for an analy-&#13;
tical framework that could help in preparing longer-term projections, led to&#13;
the decision to build a new global model.&#13;
4.        This work has benefited from a number of other efforts at global&#13;
modeling. Several global models developed over the past decade purport to&#13;
describe the functioning of the world economy and try to provide insights&#13;
into the process of future development. They include studies by Forrester,&#13;
Mesarovic and Pestel, 1/ for example, and the Leontief and Bariloche models. 2/&#13;
These models typically rely on a set of macro-variables to describe relations&#13;
within and among a limited set of geopolitical units. They have had to use&#13;
extremely simplified specifications for variables such as the growth of world&#13;
population, depletion of resources, production, pollution and so on. Among&#13;
this group, the Leontief model presents the most detailed specification of&#13;
sectors and regions, but is completely demand-oriented and static, and ignores&#13;
policy interactions. Another approach to global modeling is that taken by&#13;
Project LINK which tries to link together a large number of detailed country&#13;
models. 3/ Although the LINK model is designed for short-term forecasting,&#13;

B. Concept of Regions in the Global Framework&#13;
5.        There are at present some 180 countries and/or territories in the&#13;
world. Since each country has, to a greater or lesser extent, an independent&#13;
set of economic policies, an ideal world model might have independent modules&#13;
for each country unit. This is neither technically nor managerially feasible&#13;
at the present time. Given the objective of having a set of consistent global&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accounts for trade and capital flows, the idea of linking models for a limiL,d&#13;
number of individual countries was also rejected. 1/ While such an approach&#13;
has the advantage of retaining identifiable units, the World Bank's own expe-&#13;
rience in using only a limited number of individual country models indicates&#13;
that it is frequently difficult to generate consistent global accounts at&#13;
the desired level of detail. A small group of countries may be very repre-&#13;
sentative with respect to, say, GDP, while being quite unrepresentative of&#13;
even broad categories of international trade or capital flows.&#13;
6.        The analytical framework being developed within the World Bank&#13;
divides the world into 15 "regions" iu an attempt to strike a balance between&#13;
the under-specification of models like that developed by Forrester, and the&#13;
detail that arises from a large number of individual country models. The&#13;
regional groupings currently being used are shown In Appendix 1. They in-&#13;
clude eleven developing country regions, two industrialized country regions,&#13;
a capital surplus oil exporting region and a centrally planned economies (CPE)&#13;
region. Apart from the CPE group, these regions were established on the basis&#13;
of geographical location and GNP per capita. Behind this classification are&#13;
several implicit assumptions, at least with respect to the projection period&#13;
1975-1990: first, that the countries in each group face roughly similar&#13;
development problems; second, that they have roughly similar economic systems&#13;
(hence the separate group for the CPEs); and third, that they will, under con-&#13;
ditions of choice, behave in a generally homogeneous fashion.&#13;
7.        Each of the regions is treated separately in the global model, but&#13;
they are brought together through a linkage mechanism that includes exports&#13;
and imports of six categories of goods and services, a number of different&#13;
types of capital flows, and debt service payments. How this is done is&#13;
described in Section II.&#13;
1/   However, the 40 independent sample panel country models continue to be&#13;
available to provide a cross-check on projections for developing country&#13;
regions obtained from the global model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE MODEL SYSTEM&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
8.        The approach taken in developing the model system was influenced&#13;
by several factors: the kinds of policy issues to be addressed; theoretical&#13;
considerations in specifying the nature of linkages among countries; the&#13;
availability of data; and the fact that this model would be part of a contip-&#13;
uing effort to improve the Bank's global analytical framework.&#13;
9.        The principal interest is in the growth prospects of developing&#13;
countries in an increasingly interdependent world, so there is a rather&#13;
detailed treatment of these countries in the model as the earlier reference&#13;
to groupings indicated. One important policy concern was the effect of var-&#13;
ious patterns of international trade and capital flows on the growth of&#13;
developing countries. A closely related policy issue was the effect of&#13;
variations in the level of economic activity of the industrialized coun-&#13;
tries on the prospects for the developing countries. These interests in-&#13;
fluenced the way in which we have disaggregated global trade and capital&#13;
flows and the productive sectors of the regions in the model. However, it&#13;
is recognized that constraints other than foreign exchange availabilities&#13;
play an important role in determining growth and structural change in par-&#13;
ticular groups of developing countries. This factor has influenced our&#13;
approach to modeling the domestic economic activities of the country groups.&#13;
10.       The %lobal analytical framework consists of three main modules:&#13;
-    a set of 15 models for the individual regions defined&#13;
in the system;&#13;
-    a module that handles international trade and commodity&#13;
prices; and&#13;
-    a module that deals with international capital flows&#13;
and their allocation among the regions.&#13;
These three modules have been chosen for analytical and computational con-&#13;
venience and will be described in turn below. The regional models are con-&#13;
cerned with "domestic" economic activity and are calculated in constant 1975&#13;
prices. The focus of the trade module is on trade flows among regions, and&#13;
these are specified in both constant 1975 prices and current prices. The&#13;
capital flows module deals with the global supply of various types of capital&#13;
(expressed in current prices) and their allocation among regions in a manner&#13;
that is consistent with the trade flows.&#13;
11.       At present, the three modules are independently calculated, but&#13;
certain outputs of each are inputs to others and thus the three are linked&#13;
via recursive iteration, a process which, under present specifications,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
converges quickly.   (See Figure 1 for a schematic representation of these&#13;
linkages.)  Keeping the three functionally separate was dictated not only&#13;
by computational and analytical convenience, but also by the fact that the&#13;
theoretical linkages are, in reality, poorly understood and even less well&#13;
documented. Needless to say, work is being done on these linkages as part&#13;
of the efforts to improve the global analytical framework.&#13;
12.       It is perhaps worth pointing out that a number of variables used&#13;
in the global model have been projected exogenously, some coming from supple-&#13;
mentary analytical frameworks, for example, population models and commodity&#13;
models, and others from independent studies (for example, OECD's analyses&#13;
of growth prospects for member countries).&#13;
B. The Regional Module&#13;
13.       The 11 regional models for developing countries are all similar&#13;
in structure; the models for the other four regions are discussed separately&#13;
below.&#13;
Regional Models for Developing Countries&#13;
14.       These regional models are dynamic optimizing models in the tradi-&#13;
tion of economy-wide planning models. Their specifications are described&#13;
in Appendix II. 'For the projection period as a whole (1975-90), the aggre-&#13;
gate output of the region in question is maximized subject to a number of&#13;
constraints. These constraints can be classified into four groups: tech-&#13;
nological; behavioral; "domestic" policy; and international environment.&#13;
The first two enter as parameters estimated from time series and cross-&#13;
country data; the last two groups are specified exogenously. The "domestic"&#13;
policy constraints are mainly tax rates, exports, import allocations and&#13;
government expenditures. The constraints imposed by the international en-&#13;
vironment include the growth of world 'trade, growth of industrialized coun-&#13;
tries, world commodity prices and inflation, and the supply of external&#13;
capital.&#13;
15.       The method by which resources are allocated within the regiornl&#13;
models is familiarly known as "constrained maximization." At any period&#13;
of time the regional models satisfy a consistent set of behavioral and tech-&#13;
nological patterns and accounting entities and at the same time maximize&#13;
growth. Changes in GDP are derived from changes in consumption and invest-&#13;
ment behavior, changes in domestic and export demand, changes in technclogy&#13;
and productivity, changes in the volumes and terms of trade, and changes in&#13;
government policy. Accounting consistency is maintained among (i) private&#13;
sector and government accounts; (ii) trade accounts; (iii) national income&#13;
and product accounts; and (iv) input-output accounts. Figure 2 shows the&#13;
way the model operates for a developing region.&#13;

16.       Production Activities.   Production activities are divided into the&#13;
following groups: food; non-food agriculture; metals and minerals; energy;&#13;
manufactures; and services (including construction and utilities). All six&#13;
sectors produce consumer and intermediate goods, but capital goods are pro-&#13;
duced by only two sectors: manufacturing (i.e. equipment), and services (i.e.&#13;
construction). Output is determined within an input-output framework. Two&#13;
major kinds of inputs are used in the production process: intermediate mate-&#13;
rial inputs and primary inputs--namely capital stocks and labor. An upper&#13;
bound is placed on the growth of the agricultural sectors as.a proxy for con-&#13;
straints imposed by the availability of land. Output is related to inter-&#13;
mediate inputs by a set of fixed coefficients, corresponding to a given tech-&#13;
nology. For lack of reliable data on capital stocks, capital enters into&#13;
the production process in an incremental fashion: thus any additions to&#13;
capacity depend on the availability of new investments or unused production&#13;
capacity from previous periods. The relation between new investment and&#13;
additional capacity (output) in each sector is determined by an incremental&#13;
capital-output ratio (ICOR). Technology is fixed for any given time period,&#13;
but is assumed to change over time: first, the input-output coefficients&#13;
are assumed to change as the economy grows, and second, the sectoral ICORs&#13;
are also assumed to change to reflect the impact of new technology on the&#13;
production process.&#13;
17.       The increase in output of each sector depends partly on the level&#13;
of new investment, and partly on the supply of labor. Thus, in any given&#13;
time period some resources may be idle. But because the model attempts to&#13;
obtain the most efficient use of resources under a range of alternative pro-&#13;
duction possibilities, the underutilization of resources remains at a minimal&#13;
level in practice. 1/&#13;
18.       Income Generation and Consumption Activities.    Income is generated&#13;
from domestic and foreign sources. Domestic income is derived from the factor&#13;
payments from production activities and is measured in terms of gross value&#13;
added in each sector. The income from abroad includes net factor income&#13;
receipts (e.g., workers' remittances and interest on foreign assets) and&#13;
current transfers. The income of the private sector consists of value added,&#13;
net of taxes and non-tax payments to the public sector, plus net factor income&#13;
and private transfers from abroad. We assume that the private sector receives&#13;
all workers' remittances from abroad, as well as dividends from private direct&#13;
investments overseas. Government income comprises all domestic tax and non-&#13;
tax revenues, net of subsidies, official transfers from abroad, and interest&#13;
earned on foreign assets other than direct investments.&#13;
1/   See Appendix II, Section B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
19o       Private consumption has been made a function of net disposable&#13;
income (total income from domestic and foreign sources, net of taxea and&#13;
subsidies). Further, we have assumed that the consumption pattern of the&#13;
private sector can be described statistically with estimated expenditure&#13;
equations. Government outlays for goods and services are given exogencusly.&#13;
The demand of the private and government sectors can be aggregated to deter-&#13;
mine the total consumption demand for goods and services from each sector.&#13;
20.       Foreign Trade.   All the sectoral products except construction may&#13;
be traded. The exports of each region, including non-factor service receipts,&#13;
are determined exogenously, as described below. The overall level of imports&#13;
of goods and non-factor services is determined by exogenously-given exports&#13;
plus net capital inflows, also discussed below. The commodity composition&#13;
of merchandise imports is then determined in two stages. First, imports are&#13;
determined on an end-use basis, that is, they are divided into consumer goods,&#13;
capital goods and intermediate goods. Demand for imported consumer goods is&#13;
made a function of the Income of the private and public sectors; demand for&#13;
imported capital goods is a function of capital formation, while that for&#13;
intermediate goods is a function of the gross output of the reg on. These&#13;
functional relations are initially estimated from past data ard then adjusted&#13;
to allow for any predictable import substitution; judgments about the latter&#13;
have been based on supplementary information about policy and technological&#13;
changes in various groups of countries. In the second stage, the product&#13;
content of merchandise imports is determined by end-use with a set of import&#13;
allocation parameters; for example, imported consumer goods may consist of&#13;
manufactures, non-food agricultural goods and energy products. These coef-&#13;
ficients are derived from the input-output tables of the respective re&amp;ions,&#13;
and they are assumed to change as the economy grows.&#13;
21.       We also assume that a certain minimum amount of each category of&#13;
imports (by end-use) is essential for production and for minimum consumption&#13;
needs. These so-called non-competitive or essential imports are expressed&#13;
as a percentage of the total domestic demand for the category of product in&#13;
question. These proportions are assumed to change along with the changes in&#13;
production technology. Lastly, any surplus imports, as measured by the dif-&#13;
ference between total foreign exchange available for imports and total demand&#13;
for imports, are assigned among sectors by a matrix of fixed coefficients.&#13;
22.       In the case of non-factor service payments, a distinction is made&#13;
between freight and insurance and other non-factor services: freight and&#13;
insurance payments are assumed to be proportional to the value of merchandise&#13;
trade, while other non-factor service payments are projected exogenously.&#13;
23.       Prices.  The domestic price of each product is assumed to be the&#13;
same as its international price; no adjustments are made for exchange rates&#13;
and tariffs.&#13;
24.       Role of Investment Demand.   The total investable surplus at any&#13;
time is constrained by the availability of domestic and foreign savings, and&#13;
provides the financing of total investment. Domestic savings are obtained&#13;
as the difference between domestic income and consumption whereas foreign&#13;
savings are exogenously given.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
25.       The model distinguishes between demand for fixed investment (in-&#13;
cluding provisions for replacement), and changes in inventories. Changes in&#13;
inventories are further divided, between those planned and those unplanned.&#13;
The model is designed to maximize the increase in output over the projection&#13;
period (it actually maximizes the discounted value of output). It does so&#13;
by ensuring that t    distribution of new investment over the entire projec-&#13;
tion period is optimal given the various constraints in the model, including&#13;
for example the exogenous set of export and government consumption demands,&#13;
the need for a certain amount of non-competitive imports, and so on.&#13;
26.       This constrained optimization process determines the demand for&#13;
new fixed investment in each period, after taking into account replacement&#13;
demand and planned changes in inventories. Replacement demand is propor-&#13;
tional to gross output, the latter acting as a proxy for capital stock&#13;
utilization. The demand for fixed investment in each production sector&#13;
is then translated into demand for capital goods by source (i.e., equipment&#13;
from the manufacturing sector, and construction from the service sector)&#13;
using a matrix of capital coefficients. These coefficients are assumed to&#13;
change over time to reflect secular changes in the distribution of invest-&#13;
ment between plant and equipment.&#13;
27.       Total demand in each sector is obtained by aggregating the demand&#13;
for intermediate goods, consumption goods, fixed investment and planned in-&#13;
ventories. At any given time, aggregate demand and supply in a product&#13;
market are balanced by unintended changes in stocks. In practice, these&#13;
stocks remain at a minimal level for two reasons: first, unintended inven-&#13;
tories in one period *are used to meet planned inventory needs in the next&#13;
period; and, second, the optimization process tends to allocate investment&#13;
so as to minimize these inventories.&#13;
28.       Terms of Trade and Foreign Capital Inflows.    The net supply of&#13;
foreign capital, as measured by the balance on the goods and non-factor ser-&#13;
vices account, is exogenously determined in any given time period. Together&#13;
with exports, also exogenously given, the inflow of foreign capital determines&#13;
the aggregate import capacity.&#13;
29.       Since the balance of payments accounts of each region (in particu-&#13;
lar, factor incomes and capital account transactions) are projected at current&#13;
prices rather than at constant 1975 prices, regional capital requirements are&#13;
affected by gains or losses resulting from changes in the terms of trade.&#13;
Total exports and imports at current prices are determined from the respective&#13;
prices and quantities traded. For each region the combination of changing&#13;
relative prices and changing commodity composition of trade means that the&#13;
unit value indices for total exports and imports may diverge, thereby giving&#13;
rise to gains or losses from changes In terms of trade.&#13;
30.       Factor income receipts and payments include workers' remittances&#13;
and dividends on private direct investment (both of which are exogenously&#13;
given), interest income on foreign assets, and interest payments on external&#13;
debt. As the subsequent discussion indicates, the latter are endogenously&#13;
determined by the initial stock of foreign debt and by projected new loan&#13;
inflows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
31.       Official and private transfers are both given exogenously, as is&#13;
net private direct investment. Changes in the level of reserves ate deter-&#13;
mined by changes in the level of imports. Two other broad categories of&#13;
capital inflows are identified in the model. These are medium- and long-&#13;
term loans (or liabilities) and "other capital." The latter is given'exo-&#13;
genously. 1/ The balance of payments account is therefore closed by the&#13;
inflow of medium- and long-term loan capital. For any given region, the&#13;
inflow of loan capital is just sufficient to meet the net requirement for&#13;
foreign exchange after allowing for service payments on debt (interest charges&#13;
plus repayments of principal).&#13;
32.       Several different categories of medium- and long-term loan capital&#13;
are included in the regional model. These are; concessional loans from&#13;
bilateral sources and from multilateral sources; and loans at market terms&#13;
from bilateral sources, multilateral sources, and private sources. The supply&#13;
of new loans from all but the private sources is given exogenously, so that&#13;
it is new borrowing from private sources that balances payments.&#13;
33.       Although the inflow of private loans is determined exogenously for&#13;
each region, two important constraints are imposed on the level of new bor-&#13;
rowing. First, there is a global constraint on the supply of loan capital&#13;
from private sources for all regions. Second, the level of private borrowing&#13;
by any given region is constrained by the need to keep its burden of debt ser-&#13;
vice payments within reasonable limits. In the model solutions, the need to&#13;
maintain a reasonable degree of external financial stability emerged as an&#13;
important constraint on the level of borrowing in several developing reglons.&#13;
Treatment of Industrialized Countri'es and Other Regions&#13;
34.       To a large extent, the projections for the two industrialized country&#13;
regions (industrialized Europe, and North America, Japan arid Oceanfa),-the cen-&#13;
trally planned economies, and the capital surplus oil exporters are exogenous.&#13;
In the case of the OECD countries, the limits of our time and manpower, the&#13;
complexity of the economies and their sheer size, all suggested that these&#13;
parts of the global model should be exogenous, at least for the time leing.&#13;
The main reason for treating the other two regions exogenously was the lack&#13;
of data, and, in the case of the CPEs, our limited understanding of the work-&#13;
ings of these economies.&#13;
35.       The projections of GNP for the industrialized country regions rely&#13;
heavily on the work of other agencies, notably the OECD and the IMF. The&#13;
exports and imports of these two regions are initially determined exogenously.&#13;
1/   Although this item is treated as a single variable in the model, it in-&#13;
cludes changes in short-term assets and liabilities, changes in medium-&#13;
and long-term assets, allocation of SDRs, capital subscriptions, capital&#13;
not elsewhere included, errors and omissions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Exports are projected using the same method as for the other regions, which&#13;
is explained below. Imports are related to GDP by commodity-specific elas-&#13;
ticities. Ultimately, however, both OECD imports and exports are modified&#13;
through a global adjustment procedure.&#13;
36.       For all of these regions only the current accounts of the balance&#13;
of payments have been fully specified; complete capital accounts have not&#13;
been spelled out, in view of the difficulties of handling the interrelations&#13;
between the international capital market and the balance of payments accounts&#13;
of these regions. Certain capital account items related to ODA flows from&#13;
those regions have been projected, as the subsequent discussion of the capital&#13;
flow module indicates. These are mainly the net flows of concessional loans&#13;
to developing countries, subscriptions to international organizations and&#13;
official export credits to LDCs.&#13;
C. The International Trade Module&#13;
37.       In the present model the growth of world trade is constrained by&#13;
the GDP growth of the OECD regions, to which it is related by a fixed elas-&#13;
ticity. The latter was estimated taking account of past shifts in the rela-&#13;
tionship, from the pre-trade liberalization period of the fifties to the&#13;
"trade creation" era of the sixties. The relationship between world trade&#13;
and OECD growth seems likely to remain significant: the small share of the&#13;
developing countries in world markets at present implies that they are not&#13;
likely to have a significant impact on the overall growth of world trade&#13;
within the projection period.&#13;
38.       The projections of primary exports from each region are exogenous,&#13;
and are based on the Bank's regular analysis of world market prospects for&#13;
major primary commodities. Projections of export volumes of 35 individual&#13;
commodities from major supplying countries are based on the same assumptions&#13;
about OECD growth and international inflation as those used in the global&#13;
framework, and are subsequently aggregated into the regional format and trade&#13;
classification used in the global model. Though this sample of 35 commodities&#13;
is an incomplete one, it is nevertheless regarded as representative of the&#13;
total trade in each category for each region. 1/&#13;
1/   Roughly speaking, the commodities covered by the detailed analysis&#13;
accounted for 70% of LDC total merchandise export earnings in 1975.&#13;
The commodity samples are more representative for some regions than&#13;
for others; they are generally more representative for the developing&#13;
than for the industrialized countries. Moreover, the smaller the&#13;
share of a given commodity in a region's exports, the less represen-&#13;
tative the sample.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
39.       As primary exports are specified exogenously, global consistency&#13;
in the trade module is maintained by successive adjustments of regional&#13;
imports (the method of adjustment is described below). The volume of priliary&#13;
trade is therefore essentially determined by supply. At least for food and&#13;
energy, this is not unrealistic. Given the pre-determined level of world&#13;
merchandise trade on the one hand, and the exogenous primary export projec-&#13;
tions on the other, the global level of trade in manufactures is therefore&#13;
fixed at the outset. The regional distribution of imports and exports of&#13;
manufactures is arrived at through successive rounds of adjustments, sub-&#13;
ject to the global constraint, starting with the first set of exogenous&#13;
projections of regional exports.&#13;
40.       In the case of exports, changes may be made in the assumptions&#13;
about the growth of specific commodity groups, whereas for imports the adjust-&#13;
ments are achieved by varying the assumptions about regional rates of import&#13;
substitution.&#13;
41.       This global integration procedure has the disadvantage that it&#13;
ignores the origin and destination structure of trade. But although bilateral&#13;
flows are not explicitly formulated in the integrated version of the global&#13;
model, they can nevertheless be estimated once the overall model solution is&#13;
obtained. For that purpose an iterative technique has been used, originating&#13;
from input-output analysis. I/ The elements of a base period matrix are sub-&#13;
jected to successive row- and column-wise adjustments, under the constraint&#13;
of new "desired" row and column totals. Given the base period matrix of in-&#13;
terregional trade and projected regional imports and exports, a consistent&#13;
set of bilateral trade projections is derived for any given commodity. In&#13;
effect, each bilateral flow is a fui.nttion of the total imports of the region&#13;
of destination and the total exports of the region of origin. This method&#13;
provides a consistent synthesis, even if a rather mechanical one, of- the&#13;
independent supply and demand constraints imposed on regional trade through&#13;
the global adjustment procedure. The method allows us to interpret the&#13;
results of the global adjustment approach in terms of implied shifts in the&#13;
interregional structure of trade.&#13;
D. The Capital Flows Module&#13;
42.       The global capital flows module includes a set of assumptions about&#13;
the supply of various types of capital available to the LDC regions in the&#13;
model, and a procedure for allocating the supplies among these regions. As&#13;
1/   Richard Stone (1963), "Input-Output Relations 1954-66.    A Program for&#13;
Growth," Series 3, Department of Applied Economics, University of&#13;
Cambridge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
already noted, we have not attempted to include the capital accounts of the&#13;
industrialized countries, the CPEs or the capital surplus oil exporters in&#13;
the model at this stage. As explained above, the developing country regions'&#13;
demand for external capital arises from the need to finance net imports of&#13;
goods and non-factor services, to service debt and to maintain reserves. We&#13;
are here concerne, with ensuring that the LDC regions' demand for each cate-&#13;
gory of capital balances the projected supply.&#13;
43.       Sources of Supply.   The capital flows module includes four different&#13;
types of capital flows: transfers from official and private sources; private&#13;
direct investment; medium- and long-term loans, and "other" capital.&#13;
44.       The projections of transfers distinguish between official transfers&#13;
(that is, transfers received by the reporting country's official sector), and&#13;
private transfers. It is assumed that the total supply of official transfers&#13;
available to the LDCs is equivalent to Official Development Assistance (ODA),&#13;
that is, bilateral grants (net of technical assistance from the industrialized&#13;
country regions) together with grants from the capital surplus oil exporting&#13;
regions and from international organizations. These projections of official&#13;
transfers are made in connection with the projections of total ODA which are&#13;
discussed below. Private transfers to LDCs are projected independently, and&#13;
partly depend on the projected economic conditions in the developed countries.&#13;
45.       Private direct investment in LDCs is projected independently on&#13;
the basis of what is currently known about the climate for private invest-&#13;
ment and about the intentions of investors and host countries. The category&#13;
"other capital," also projected exogenously, is in practice dominated by&#13;
short-term capital, and we expect this to continue to be the case at least&#13;
through the mid-1980s. The growth in "other" capital is hence related broadly&#13;
to the growth in the imports of LDCs.&#13;
46.       We have made an explicit assumption about the supply of each cate-&#13;
gory of medium- and long-term loans. The main categories identified in the&#13;
model are as follows:&#13;
Loans at Concessional Terms&#13;
From bilateral sources (DAC, OPEC, other)&#13;
From multilateral sources&#13;
Loans at Market Rates&#13;
Official export credits&#13;
From multilateral sources&#13;
From private sources&#13;
Suppliers' credits&#13;
Financial markets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
47.       The supply of concessional loans is derived from the supply of ODA&#13;
from the OECD Development Assistance Committee, OPEC and other sources. Total&#13;
ODA is projected independently for each source; for DAC members the supply&#13;
is related to their projected GNP. Four types of ODA flows are distinguished&#13;
for each category of donor; technical assistance, grants, bilateral loans,&#13;
and flows to multilateral institutions. The portion of ODA that is technical&#13;
assistance does not generally appear in the balance of payments of recipieut&#13;
countries, as it is seldom possible to ascertain and record the receipts&#13;
involved, so these flows are excluded from the receipts of the LDC regions&#13;
in the model. Flows to multilateral institutions are treated separately.&#13;
Although these contributions form a part of, and are a claim on, the total&#13;
official resources made available by donor governments, they do not flow&#13;
directly to developing countries. The flow of ODA from these multilateral&#13;
institutions to the LDC regions in the model is also projected exogenously;&#13;
in general, it is related to the projected flows from donors to these insti-&#13;
tutions.&#13;
48.       Loans at market rates--official export credits, private suppliers'&#13;
credits, and loans at market terms from multilateral sources--are all pro-&#13;
jected exogenously. Those from multilateral sources are projected on the&#13;
basis of announced lending intentions.&#13;
49.       As indicated earlier loans from private financial markets are used&#13;
to balance the external accounts of the LDC regions in the model. Because&#13;
of the global constraint imposed on the growth in supply of these loans to&#13;
LDCs, the original projection of the aggregate demand for loan funds had to&#13;
be adjusted downwards.&#13;
50.       The various categories of capital are allocated among the regions&#13;
according to several criteria,including, for example, historical patterns,&#13;
the announced intentions of various donor groups, in the case of ODA, and&#13;
the ability of the various regions to absorb loans at market terms. In prac-&#13;
tice, the final allocation is arrived at in an iterative way with a series&#13;
of adjustments being made to-the allocation of loans from private financial&#13;
markets.&#13;
E. Treatment of International Prices&#13;
51.       The integration of real and monetary variables in the global analy-&#13;
tical framework is less than complete. There is no detailed supply and demand&#13;
model which simultaneously determines prices and quantities by commodity group&#13;
and region. Rather, relative unit values are projected independently from real&#13;
trade flows and subsequently inflated to take into account an assumed rate of&#13;
world inflation.&#13;
52.       The disadvantages of this approach are not likely to be very serious&#13;
in that dramatic and lasting changes in relative prices are not anticipated.&#13;
Moreover, since our analysis focuses essentially on the medium to long term,&#13;

it is more concerned with structural trends than with fluctuations around&#13;
these trends. A more serious weakness, however, is that the present frame-&#13;
work cannot analyze the effects on comparative advantages of relative changes&#13;
in production costs brought about by differential exchange rate movements&#13;
and pricing policies among or within regions. Current efforts are seeking&#13;
to make real trade flows price-sensitive, by specifying region- and commodity-&#13;
specific price elasticities of supply and demand.&#13;
53.       In the analytical framework the rate of global inflation is given&#13;
exogenously by an international price index. This price index is used to&#13;
deflate all service account transactions and capital flows in the model.&#13;
54.       The commodity price indices for food, non-food agriculture, metals&#13;
and minerals, and energy are derived from independent analysis of supply and&#13;
demand prospects for the sample of 35 commodities.&#13;
55.       In contrast to those for primary commodities, the unit value in-&#13;
dices used for trade in manufactures do not rely on projections of inter-&#13;
national prices for individual products. In order to account for relevant&#13;
differences in the product composition of manufactured exports by origin and&#13;
destination, four different unit value indices of manufactured exports are&#13;
distinguished, relating to exports from and to industrialized and devel-&#13;
oping countries. 1/ Projections are based on regression analysis that&#13;
relates these indices to an index of global inflation.&#13;
56.       While the unit values for the individual commodity categories are&#13;
exogenously given, the overall trade deflators for each region are endogenous,&#13;
in the sense that they take account of changes in the commodity composition&#13;
of regional trade flovs. As discussed earlier, the international prices of&#13;
products are incorporated in the regional models.&#13;

III. DATA. MODEL ESTIHATION AND VALIDATION&#13;
57.       Assembling data for the global model involved four main tasks:&#13;
(1) construction of a set of global accounts for 1975 to act as a set of&#13;
initial conditions for the model; (ii) estimation of parameters for each&#13;
region for the base year 1975; (iii) projection of changes in the base year&#13;
values of parameters for 1980, 1985 and 1990; and (iv) projection of changes&#13;
in the exogenous variables in the model. The estimates of future values for&#13;
parameters and exogenous variables are, for obvious reasons, necessarily&#13;
uncertain, but it is our belief that while rough they are generally plausible,&#13;
and that they provide a solid base for future improvements.&#13;
58.       Ihe data used in the study were drawn mainly from the extensive&#13;
set of social and economic statistics assembled within the World Bank from&#13;
various international, regional, and national institutions.&#13;
A. Global Accounts for the Base Year&#13;
59.       A major effort was mounted to develop a set of national income,&#13;
balance of payments and trade accounts for each region for the base year&#13;
1975. (The choice of a base year was largely dictated by the availability&#13;
of data.) This was a two-stage process: a preliminary set of regional&#13;
accounts was first obtained by aggregating the data for individual coun-&#13;
tries into relevant regional totals; a final set of regional accounts was&#13;
then obtained by adjusting those preliminary regional accounts for which&#13;
sufficient data on individual countries were not available. The numbers&#13;
of countries for which various sets of data were available are reported in&#13;

60.       The regional national income accounts comprise data on the industrial&#13;
origin of gross domestic product (GDP) at factor cost and on expenditures or&#13;
GDP at market prices. The preliminary accounts for LDCs were based on data&#13;
for 90 developing countries (which account for 96X of the total GDP of devel-&#13;
oping countries) and all industrialized countries. The input-output coeffi-&#13;
cient matrices, derived from data prepared by Carter and Petrie of Brandeis&#13;
University for the Leontief study, 1/ were the major tools used in disaggre-&#13;
gating the regional national income accounts into commodity balances for the&#13;
six production sectors specified in the regional models.&#13;
61.       The merchandise imports and exports of each region were calculated&#13;
from United Nations trade data. Once the totals were established the next&#13;
step was to expand these accounts to cover the origin and destination of&#13;
merchandise trade among the 15 regions in the model. This was done by com-&#13;
bining the above accounts with United Nations data about trade flows amung&#13;
certain groups of countries.&#13;

62.       The preliminary regional estimates of the balance of payments&#13;
accounts were derived by merging data from the International Monetary Fund,&#13;
the United Nations and the World Bank's Debt Reporting System (DRS) with the&#13;
estimates of merchandise trade just mentioned. Among the "invisible" items&#13;
of the current account, data on non-factor service and factor service income&#13;
were obtained from IMF, except for those on interest payments, which were&#13;
taken from the DRS. 1/ For the items in the capital account, as well as re-&#13;
serves, estimates were obtained from IMF data, with the exception of "Medium&#13;
and Long-term Loan Capital" which was obtained from the DRS.&#13;
B. Parameter Estimation&#13;
63.       The parameters used in the regional models, and the sources of data&#13;
from which estimates have been made, are summarized in Table 2.&#13;
64.       The input-output coefficients were derived from input-output matrices&#13;
prepared for the Leontief study, after reaggregation into the sectoral and&#13;
regional groups used in the World Bank model. As in the United Nations study&#13;
we have assumed that the coefficients are income-specific and that they change&#13;
over time with changes in per capita income, the latter being taken as an&#13;
index of the overall level of economic and technical development of the region&#13;
in question.&#13;
1/ Because of data limitations, origin-destination accounts were not prepared&#13;
for non-factor services.&#13;

The Objective Function&#13;
i.   Volume of Production as the Maximand&#13;
max E A P'(F - MS).&#13;
tt&#13;
This is a rather unconventional formulation. It attempts to maximize&#13;
some measure of efficiency in the use of resources. Efficiency has been defined&#13;
as the returns from the use of resources, measured in terms of real value added&#13;
deflated by a discounting factor. We have used final demands (exports, con-&#13;
sumption, and investment) minus imports as a proxy for value added; since the&#13;
former concepts are based on product classifications, we can use relevant&#13;
prices to deflate each of them. Ideally, one should choose "profit" as the&#13;
maximand. In that case, the solution values could approximate the "von Neumann&#13;
growth path."&#13;
ii. Consumption as the Maximand, as an Alternative Objective Function&#13;
max E A tP(C + Cr)&#13;
t      U    r&#13;
The decision regarding resource allocation is guided mainly by the&#13;
consideration of maximizing the discounted value of real consumption aver&#13;
the projection period.&#13;
In the detailed discussions to follow it is made clear that, unlike&#13;
most other macro-economic linear programming models, the present model's&#13;
specification does not provide for any intertemporal choice in the sectoral&#13;
shares of consumption. The maximand (i.e., total consumption) can be affected,&#13;
in this case, only by sectoral reallocation of income and its intertemporal&#13;
path. Consumption propensities are strictly behavioral; in discounting the&#13;
future consumption stream, we adopted an exogenously determined international&#13;
discount rate.&#13;
Because of the lack of consumption choices (consumption propensi-&#13;
ties are predetermined by behavior), the solution values under the "consump-..&#13;
tion maximand" are very close to the solution values under the "value added&#13;
maximand" in our present exercise.   But there is one minor difference:   depend-&#13;
ing on the values of consumption, production, and investment parameters, the&#13;
two alternative approaches (with different "maximands") might yield two dif-&#13;
ferent sectoral compositions of output. For example, if the rural sector&#13;
(i.e., agricultural activities) has a higher propensity to save than the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
APPENDIX II&#13;
urban sector but a comparatively lower incremental capital! output ratio, the&#13;
consumption maximand might favor less production in the rural (i.e., agricul-&#13;
tural growth) than in the urban sector as compared with the latter approach.&#13;
Nonetheless, conceptually, any variant of consumption as the maximand with&#13;
a. set of ELES consumption functions with the existing constraints leads to&#13;
double. optimization. 1/&#13;

i.   Allocation of Investment&#13;
The methods of sectoral allocation of investment used in the model&#13;
provide its main dynamics. Investments are allocated between sectors by their&#13;
rates of return, evaluated by the relative prices of the current period. In&#13;
any period, fixed investment in a sector will be sufficient to provide the&#13;
minimum additional capacity needed to generate output (with a one year lag)&#13;
to match the consumption, investment, and export demands (net of imports)&#13;
of the next period. In this investment decision, the investor first tries&#13;
to utilize all existing capacity before assessing the needs for additional&#13;
-capacity. However, there are circumstances where even over-investment will&#13;
be economical. For example, if certain essential primary inputs are avail-&#13;
able only in the present period, and cannot be transferred to the next period,&#13;
then it is economical tQ use them as inputs for investment during the present&#13;
period and transfer them to the future period in the form of idle capacity.&#13;
IS &gt; 8aX + 6K - ICS-1&#13;
In the above equation,   X depicts the fixed new investment and&#13;
working capital, whereas K gives the replacement investment. B and 4 give&#13;
the capital coefficient matrices for both types of investments.   They are&#13;
also normalized. They carry a time conscript since they change over time,&#13;
according to the per capita income of the economy (used as a proxy for the&#13;
stage of technological development).   Similarly, and by the same logic, the&#13;
values of ICORs are changed with respect to GDP growth, i.e., updated outside&#13;
the model with respect to previous GDP growth.&#13;

ii. Treatment of the Foreign Trade Sector&#13;
The total resource transfers (measured as the current account bal-&#13;
ance) from one country or region to another are determined by policy. Given.&#13;
exogenously determined "net factor income" and "current transfers," the trade&#13;
balance for any country is preassigned. 1/ Exports being known (by the export&#13;
demand equation)., total imports are predetermined.   Sectoral imports are,&#13;
however, determined endogenously as a solution value in the model.&#13;
Imports are divided into two groups: essential and non-essential.&#13;
The essential imports (of any commodity) by any sector are elastic with&#13;
respect to both price and demand. The price elasticity is measured in terms&#13;
of the percentage change in the imports of the commodity in response to a&#13;
percentage clhange in the relative price of the commodity 'in the international&#13;
market. The demand elasticity 2/ is defined as the percentage change in&#13;
imports in response to a given percentage change in the total demand for that&#13;
commodity by the importers. The total demiand to be used for estimating the&#13;
demand elasticity may arise-from consumers, producers, or investors.     For&#13;
example,,demand for machinery can be taken as proportional to the volume;of&#13;
capital formation, given unchanged relative prices.&#13;
The problem of import substitution has been treated(ia two ways.&#13;
One part of import substitutions takes place In response to changes in rela-&#13;
tive prices, and the other part is dependent on the-changes in technology&#13;
and policies.  The term MSS   ("surplus" imports) captures the latter aspect&#13;
of import substitution, and it is made exogenous in most cases.&#13;
In this scheme, only when non-essential imports vanish does the&#13;
availability of foreign exchange act as a binding=constraint .(trade -con-&#13;
straint) on growth.&#13;
iii. Sectoral Balances&#13;
The sectoral balances in an economy are represented as&#13;
GC &lt; (1- A)X - Cr - Cr - IS - E + MS + STO 1-&#13;
1/   It assumes that foreign exchange reserves cannot accumulate beyond the&#13;
value of several months' worth of imports. which are set exogenously&#13;
in the model.&#13;
2/ A derived measure and not strictly an estimated parameter.&#13;
3/   This is necessary because of the upper bound set on the accumulation&#13;
of reserves, described above.&#13;

APPENDIX II&#13;
Government consumption (GCit) is exogenous.   The supply of any&#13;
sec.tor. in any year ec~t ls production plus imports. Demand originates from&#13;
consumption (rural + urban), investment, and exports. If supply and demand&#13;
do not: match, unintended stocks absorb the shock. In the next period, they&#13;
are.carried over and added to the supply side of the identity.    Since stocks&#13;
do not appear in the value of the maximand (i.e., they have, conceptually,&#13;
a zero.price coefficient), the program keeps stocks at.the minimam level.&#13;

            The global framework
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper describes the main features
            of the global model system used in preparing the World
            Bank's World Development Report, 1979. The system
            provides a quantitative basis for the study of growth
            prospects in developing countries in the context of the
            world economy, and has been used to make projections for the
            period 1975-90. It is not a finished product, but part of a
            continuing effort to improve the Bank's analytical
            methods. At present it consists of three main modules linked
            via recursive iteration: (i) models of economic activity in
            eleven developing regions, together with sets of projections
            for industrialized countries, capital surplus oil exporting
            countries and centrally planned economies; (ii) a module
            describing international trade flows and commodity prices;
            and (iii) a module describing the global supply of various
            types of capital and their allocation among regions. The
            models for developing regions are dynamic optimizing models
            in the tradition of economy-wide planning models. Aggregate
            output of the region in question is maximized subject to
            constraints imposed by technology, behavior, domestic policy
            choices and the international economic environment.
