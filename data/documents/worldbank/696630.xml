ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1         Zimbabwe is a relatively large Southern Africa country with a total area of about&#13;
390,700 square kilometers and a strong natural resource base. Its population of about 10.4&#13;
million people (1992) has a significant natural population increase (3.1% per annum) and 28% of&#13;
the population lives in urban areas. Zimbabwe's principal economic activities are manufacturing&#13;
(29% of GDP in 1993), agriculture (about 15%), mining and quarrying (about 7%), distribution,&#13;
hotels and restaurants (11%) and other services, the remaining 38%. The rate of growth of&#13;
output in the post-independence period has been modest, averaging about 2.5% per annum,&#13;
reasonably evenly-spread across major sectors, uneven over time and, unfortunately, below the&#13;
rate of population growth. In the first decade after independence, economic policies continued&#13;
the pre-independence focus on an inward orientation, including strict controls on foreign&#13;
exchange allocation, investment and prices, as well as controls on wages and labor. Long-term&#13;
macroeconomic trends generally have been characterized by economic stability, with import&#13;
substitution policies contributing to the emergence of a large and diversified manufacturing base&#13;
and self-sufficiency in food staples and agricultural raw materials.&#13;
1.2         The economic structure which characterized Zimbabwe prior to independence in&#13;
1980 continued thereafter -- a small number of highly vertically-integrated firms run by whites&#13;
and multinational corporations controlled the bulk of the productive capacity, while most black&#13;
Zimbabweans remained subsistence farmers or holders of subsistence microenterprises. The&#13;
policy framework solidified and perpetuated this bipolar economic structure.&#13;
1.3         Faced with an increasing dead-end in growth in aggregate demand, in 1991 the&#13;
Government embarked upon a significant structural adjustment and liberalization program, the&#13;
Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP) which entailed far-reaching reforms to&#13;
accelerate economic growth and broaden participation. While economic performance during&#13;
1991 was encouraging, a severe drought in 1992 and again in 1994 caused output levels to&#13;
decline. Incomes were severely eroded, resulting in a drastic decline in purchasing power. The&#13;
shortfall in domestic demand, compounded by the tight monetary stance of the Government and&#13;
the resulting high interest rates, delayed the recovery process which only started to take hold in&#13;
the second half of 1993.&#13;
1.4         The reforms adopted under the ESAP began a process of liberalization whereby&#13;
resource allocation in Zimbabwe has become increasingly market-based and many of the legal&#13;
barriers to enterprise development have been removed. However, these reforms represent the&#13;
initiation of a process that requires a continuing series of steps to improve the regulatory&#13;
framework, macroeconomic incentive framework, and the implementation capacity to manage a&#13;
market economy. Since then, there has been some instability in exchange rates and prices&#13;
because of remaining barriers, recurrent drought, and difficulties in sustaining fiscal discipline.&#13;
High real interest rates and their volatility as a result of unprecedented levels of borrowing by the&#13;
government, which mopped up long-term funds from the system, have had a depressing effect on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
the demand for debt financing, particularly longer-term financing. As a result of these factors,&#13;
the supply response to the enacted economic reforms has remained modest.&#13;
1.5         At this juncture in the adjustment process, what is most needed is for large&#13;
existing firms to restructure themselves to compete in the international market, and for SMEs to&#13;
increase their ability to perform specialized functions formerly performed by large firms, and&#13;
increasingly compete in production for the domestic market. This project aims to accelerate and&#13;
perpetuate a process whereby some of the identified micro-level supply constraints, principally&#13;
information (business services), financial (credit), and institutional (implementation capacity) are&#13;
loosened so as to accelerate this process of generating a supply response and broadening&#13;
participation.&#13;
2. THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
A. Description of the Private Sector&#13;
2.1         Background.  Following independence, Zimbabwe maintained controls on&#13;
foreign exchange allocation, investment and prices, and added others on wages and labor. This&#13;
continued the inward orientation of the economy, constrained flexibility and resulted in change&#13;
being slow. The system of racial exclusion practiced by the previous government resulted in few&#13;
black Zimbabweans owning formal sector enterprises or accumulating capital. The productive&#13;
capacity of the country, outside of the low productivity "communal lands," was in the hands of&#13;
the State (16%), White and Asian citizens (28%), and foreign interests (56%). The Government&#13;
removed implicit racial restrictions, and set up development finance institutions such as the&#13;
Small Enterprise Development Corporation (SEDCO), and the Zimbabwe Development Bank&#13;
(ZDB) in 1983-1984, but did not introduce a comprehensive program to change the structure of&#13;
ownership. A significant emphasis on black entrepreneurial development only began at the end&#13;
of the 1980s as liberalization began to remove some of the barriers to indigenous business&#13;
development. SEDCO got off to a slow start and increased its loan volume by 1989/90. From&#13;
1986/87 to 1990/91, SEDCO approved 1,188 loans, while ZDB and commercial banks only&#13;
recently began to support new and small-scale enterprises to any significant extent. Finance was&#13;
not the only restriction, however, and individual entrepreneurs who attempted to establish&#13;
themselves ran up against the dominance of established enterprises. This dominance was&#13;
entrenched by the continuation of economic policies which explicitly gave established&#13;
enterprises privileged access to key resources, particularly foreign currency, and subjected new&#13;
entrants to a complex set of restrictive regulations. As a result, the emergence and growth of&#13;
viable small-scale enterprises remained restricted.&#13;
2.2         While measures adopted since have removed many barriers, the benefits resulting&#13;
from the ESAP are perceived to flow disproportionately to the most privileged segments of the&#13;
population.  Yet the combination of incentive reform and deregulation have created the&#13;
opportunity to both increase the rate and alter the pattern of growth. It is thus crucial both to&#13;
accelerate the rate of growth and broaden participation in this growth -- broad-based growth will&#13;
likely result in the greatest labor market absorption.&#13;
2.3         Manufacturing. Zimbabwe is one of the most industrialized countries in Africa,&#13;
with the manufacturing sector producing about 29% of GDP and a wide array of commodities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ranging from food and clothing to fertilizers and chemicals, metal products of all kinds, electrical&#13;
machinery and equipment and motor vehicle assembly. Next to agriculture, it is one of the most&#13;
important sources of employment, providing livelihood to about 16% of the formal workforce in&#13;
1992. Notwithstanding its sophistication and importance to the economy, the rate of growth of&#13;
manufacturing output has averaged less than 3% per annum in the post-independence period, and&#13;
growth in employment in manufacturing since independence has been less than that of the&#13;
population. The reasons for this modest performance are, to a large extent, a reflection of the&#13;
policy environment, characterized by extensive price and investment controls and a highly&#13;
regulated foreign exchange allocation system, which the sector has had to contend for nearly&#13;
three decades. As a result of these distortions, the sector, over the years, had become excessively&#13;
inward-looking and dependent upon the limited domestic market. The ESAP program has&#13;
started to improve the structure of incentives and regulations, but the supply response to date&#13;
remains modest.&#13;
2.4          Manufacturing export performance had generally been poor, with exports actually&#13;
declining between 1981 and 1986, before growing by 6.8% per annum between 1986 and 1990.&#13;
This is modest, especially in light of the wider range of export incentives available during the&#13;
latter period.  Over the period 1981-1990, average growth was only 2.5%  per annum.&#13;
Manufactured exports did increase from 29% of total merchandise exports (including gold) in&#13;
1981 to 36% in 1990. Evidence from surveys conducted recently', however, shows that, as a&#13;
result of the ongoing reform program, there have been important changes in the manufacturing&#13;
sector, and there is evidence that resource allocation is changing in such a way as to increase&#13;
productivity in the manufacturing sector, in part through generation of exports. In the 1991-93&#13;
period, exporting companies grew at a substantially faster rate and also exhibited higher gross&#13;
investment levels. The fall in employment, which has been a common feature in several&#13;
industries, is also markedly less in companies with a higher percentage of exports in total&#13;
turnover. Labor intensive sectors have benefited from the sharp reduction in real wages,&#13;
reinforcing the expansion of exports.&#13;
2.5          Agriculture. Although the GDP share of agriculture is smaller in Zimbabwe than&#13;
in most other African countries, the economy is highly dependent upon agriculture, with the&#13;
sector providing 70% of total employment and 40% of merchandise exports. Approximately&#13;
60% of manufacturing value-added is either related to agro-industry or to the provision of inputs&#13;
into agriculture. Many services, including a sizable proportion of domestic trade, are closely&#13;
associated with agriculture. Performance of the agriculture sector has been modest, with&#13;
agricultural output growing by about 2.4% on average per annum during the first decade of&#13;
independence. While agricultural output grew rapidly in the early-to-mid 1980s as a result of&#13;
expanded plantings and yields underpinned by heavy public sector support in marketing&#13;
infrastructure and credit, it has been stagnant since then, with smallholder agriculture&#13;
experiencing declines in output and productivity.  Although an important reason for this&#13;
mediocre performance is the variability of rainfall, more fundamental causes have been declining&#13;
producer prices in real terms, reduced availability of formal sector credit, declining effectiveness&#13;
of research and extension services, and a contraction of public sector marketing services. The&#13;
introduction, since structural adjustment, of far-reaching marketing and pricing policy reforms in&#13;
See, for example, Jan Willem Gunning, ed., The Manufacturing Sector in Zimbabwe: Dynamics and Constraints, April&#13;
1994, Free University, Amsterdam and University of Zimbabwe, Harare.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
the agricultural sector are expected to have a strong impact on the systems for marketing several&#13;
major commodities. These policy changes represent a significant change from the past. Parallel&#13;
changes in import licensing and foreign exchange retention have increased the availability of&#13;
inputs required by farmers and agro-processors. Evidence of a supply response to the reforms&#13;
has come in several forms, including the emergence of urban hammer millers and of small-scale&#13;
oil expressors, and a growing interest on the part of commercial farners to produce commodities&#13;
for export. Broader interest is also emerging in the production of value-added agricultural&#13;
products, including ethanol, animal feed, and canned, frozen, and dehydrated foods. At the same&#13;
time, there has been a continued expansion of the country's export-oriented horticultural industry,&#13;
as evidenced by double-digit growth rates in trade, by a large expansion in citrus plantings in the&#13;
past three years, and by the growing numbers of large- and small-scale commercial growers&#13;
entering into cut flower production.&#13;
2.6         Mining. Zimbabwe is a mineral-abundant country, with the formal mining sector&#13;
employing about 50,000 people, contributing about 5% to GDP and accounting for about 23% of&#13;
total export earnings. Most of the minerals are gold, asbestos, nickel, copper, coal and chrome&#13;
ore, and most are exported in their raw form or as semi-processed metals. Notwithstanding the&#13;
decline in 1992 and 1993, the value of mining production has been rising steadily in recent years,&#13;
in local currency terms, largely as a result of currency depreciation. While mining output grew&#13;
only 1% per annum during the 1980s, increased profitability (in part due to exchange rate&#13;
depreciation), has helped to spur significant new investment and higher growth is now expected.&#13;
Although mineral prices continue to remain extremely volatile in the world market, there is&#13;
considerable optimism within the mining sector in Zimbabwe over its medium-term prospects,&#13;
and the sector has continued to attract new investment.&#13;
2.7         Tourism. Zimbabwe's attraction as a tourist resort stems largely from the wide&#13;
variety of scenery, flora and fauna of the country, one of the best climates in the world. Despite&#13;
these natural attractions, very limited tourism development occurred preceding independence&#13;
because of an effective global embargo. Visitor arrivals, which peaked in 1972 at 400,000, fell&#13;
to 270,000 in 1975 and further to 79,000 in 1979, of which 80% were from Southern Africa.&#13;
There was slow growth in visitor arrivals until the late 1980s but in 1992, upwards of 700,000&#13;
visitors arrived in Zimbabwe. Between 1980 and 1992, the total number of visitors grew at an&#13;
annual average rate of about 10%, and the share of tourism receipts as a percentage of GDP has&#13;
also increased from 0.8% in 1980 to about 2.6% in 1992. If the indirect and induced effects of&#13;
tourism are taken into account, the share of the sector, in both employment creation and GDP, is&#13;
probably much greater. New employment creation in the sector has been growing at an annual&#13;
rate of about 20%, far in excess of other sectors of the economy. Although the statistics on&#13;
growth of tourism are very encouraging, the tourism sector continues to rely too heavily on&#13;
regional markets with limited diversification of the tourism source markets. A strong component&#13;
of Zimbabwean tourism is also due to family visits reflecting the ethnic links between the various&#13;
population groups in the country and other neighboring states.&#13;
B. The Policy Environment&#13;
2.8         Background. To date, important reform measures have been undertaken to&#13;
improve the environment for enterprise development. With and since the ESAP in 1991, the&#13;
Government has been attempting to correct the anti-export bias and substantial changes have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
been made to the exchange and trade regime. These changes in policy have resulted in&#13;
improving the access of the private sector to scarce foreign exchange, increasing price&#13;
competitiveness through trade liberalization and reduced barriers to capital movements.&#13;
Although much has been done, more remains to correct anti-export biases (see paras. 2.11, 2.12&#13;
and 4.24 below). Considerable measures have also been undertaken to improve the incentive&#13;
framework for emerging enterprises producing for the domestic market. These have included the&#13;
deregulation of domestic markets and distribution systems and modifications to local zoning&#13;
ordinances, to enable SMEs to develop and use appropriate factory space.  Considerable&#13;
measures have been taken, albeit more is to be done, to make infrastructure sufficient and&#13;
reliable enough for emerging exporters. In particular, measures are needed to improve the&#13;
provision of telephone service, reduce the cost and improve the on-time arrivals for air freight&#13;
and expand electricity coverage.  Finally, the Government has largely removed former&#13;
restrictions on new entrants in financial intermediation, and is considering draft legislation to&#13;
improve the regulatory framework (See paras 3.5 to 3.7 below). On the macro side, actions&#13;
needed include strong fiscal management and supportive exchange rate management aimed at&#13;
maintaining a stable pattern of relative prices and export profitability.&#13;
2.9          The experience of other developing countries with relatively large inward-oriented&#13;
manufacturing sectors demonstrates that firms, such as those in Zimbabwe, can increase&#13;
productivity and expand by penetrating export markets, provided the policy environment&#13;
facilitates such adjustment. Firms can often do this by restructuring their product mix and&#13;
production processes, thereby expanding output with a small amount of investment. This calls&#13;
for an array of initiatives to reduce the remaining anti-export bias, and enable Zimbabwean firms&#13;
to become internationally competitive. These include strengthening the duty drawback and&#13;
Inward Processing Rebate systems, as well as developing Export Processing Zones. Provisions&#13;
to ensure that exporters have access to material inputs at world prices are central, but to realize&#13;
the full potential for export-oriented growth, it is also critical that the anti-export bias inherent in&#13;
relatively high border taxes be greatly reduced, that any infrastructure constraints be removed&#13;
and that exporters have access to competitively priced finance.&#13;
2.10         Taxes, Tariffs and Customs Procedures. Import liberalization since 1991 has&#13;
dramatically improved access to imported materials and capital goods, and real exchange rate&#13;
depreciation has greatly increased the competitiveness of Zimbabwean exports in international&#13;
markets, but tariff collections remain high, and exporters are still far from free from the burden&#13;
of taxes on their material inputs. Zimbabwe has one of the highest tariff collection rates in the&#13;
world, despite having a nominal tariff structure (most imports have tariff collection rates of 15 -&#13;
25%) that is not exceptionally high by developing country standards. This is because Zimbabwe&#13;
has tariffs on basic inputs, while these attract zero duty in many other countries. This increases&#13;
the cost of final goods, making them uncompetitive in external markets. This then leads to&#13;
needing significant tariff protection on downstream products. This taxation of inputs creates a&#13;
major problem for the effective implementation of duty/tax rebate systems to enable exporters to&#13;
be competitive. Even if rebates or duty exemptions can be given to direct exporters, indirect&#13;
exporters (local firms who compete in supplying these inputs) would still face a cost&#13;
disadvantage, because the existing duty drawback system is very inefficient in granting relief to&#13;
such exports, and their inputs, in turn, are taxed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
2.11         Few exporters have been able to gain timely duty relief from the effects of import&#13;
tariffs under either of the current schemes - duty drawback, or duty suspension or exemption&#13;
under inward processing rebate (IPR) provisions. Meanwhile, the domestic tax regime creates&#13;
modest cascading in the cost of locally-produced goods. This is particularly evident with respect&#13;
to services, as providers of these services must charge tax on their sales yet also pay sales tax on&#13;
their inputs. This creates a double tax effect in the cost structure as passed on to consumers.&#13;
Exporters currently cannot reclaim any of the taxes which are embodied in the cost of services&#13;
they employ. Small-scale, indirect and new exporters have found it particularly difficult to gain&#13;
relief from indirect taxes. In fact, since repayment of duties is often delayed by some nine&#13;
months and cannot be relied upon, exporters generally have to price their goods sufficiently high,&#13;
based on the assumption that they will not receive a drawback, therefore the scheme is not&#13;
affecting the volume of exports. This deficiency needs to be rectified, and firms given full and&#13;
timely relief from the cost increasing effects of all taxes on inputs they can successfully switch&#13;
from being focused on the domestic market to being export-oriented.&#13;
2.12         Concrete steps would be supported by the project to limit, mitigate or remove the&#13;
anti-export biases against exporters, and, in particular, small export producers and indirect&#13;
exporters (see paras. 4.24 to 4.25 and Annex C). These would include: (i) strengthening the&#13;
capacity of the Customs and Excise Department to administer the existing IPR and Duty&#13;
Drawback programs; (ii) establishing and publishing standard input-output coefficients; (iii)&#13;
computerizing the processing of tariff tabulations and calculations; and (iv) establishing&#13;
regulations and implementing guidelines for a Licensed Common Bonded Manufacturing&#13;
Warehouse Scheme.&#13;
2.13         Export Processing Zones (EPZs).  Zimbabwe recently enacted legislation&#13;
authorizing the establishment of Export Processing Zones. To attract and retain a broad range of&#13;
producers, the legislation provides firms with the basis for a package of incentives which are&#13;
internationally competitive, and which will minimize administrative and other impediments to&#13;
free trade. The legislation, however, is general and no implementing regulations to date have&#13;
been drafted, nor has a staff been appointed for an EPZ Authority charged with enforcing the&#13;
legislation. Assurance of a best practice EPZ regime will depend on the execution of these&#13;
provisions, as well as the transparency of the implementing regulations. The project would&#13;
support meeting those objectives.&#13;
2.14         Infrastructure. Surveys have shown that constraints on infrastructure are seen&#13;
by firms as a serious problem for their development. Irrespective of the size or the sector,&#13;
telecommunications is identified as the most serious infrastructure problem, followed by&#13;
electricity and workers' transport. The difficulty with which firms can have access to efficient&#13;
telephone service has served as an entry barrier. Small firms rated freight transport as a bigger&#13;
problem than larger firms, and also rated other infrastructure problems highly. A less formal&#13;
assessment also suggests that the cost of factory space, including either new site and construction&#13;
costs (including financing costs) or rental costs have a large impact on the cost structure of&#13;
SMEs. Survey data is supported by financial analysis. For example, freight makes up more than&#13;
half the cost of supplying fresh horticulture products (including roses and chiles) to Europe and&#13;
hence, competitiveness is heavily dependent on freight rates. Unfortunately, air freight costs&#13;
from Harare are significantly higher than from directly-competing airports such as Nairobi,&#13;
Arusha (Tanzania), and Johannesburg, because of problems with the State-owned air freight&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
company, Affretair. Second, competitiveness in these products is adversely affected by the poor&#13;
quality of service, including delays which destroy perishable exports. In terms of transport,&#13;
Beira is by far the most geographically convenient port for land-locked Zimbabwe. However, in&#13;
spite of substantial recent investment in port facilities, and increased reliability of rail and road&#13;
links through Mozambique, problems remain, resulting in uncertainty of delivery and delays in&#13;
the period to get to port. As a result, Zimbabwe continues to depend on the longer rail-sea link&#13;
via Durban, and is not able to exploit to the full the geographical advantages of the Beira link.&#13;
Finally, an evaluation by the Bank found that the cost offactory space is significantly above that&#13;
of neighboring countries, including Mauritius. While few legal barriers have been identified to&#13;
the efficient functioning of a market for small factory shells, access to financing of the&#13;
developers of such shells remains limited, which both accentuates concentration, and appears to&#13;
result in large margins between rental rates charged and mortgage payments made by owners that&#13;
have precious access to finance.&#13;
C. Enterprise Finance and Financing Constraints&#13;
2.15         While Zimbabwe has a relatively developed banking and finance sector, data from&#13;
the RPED Study indicates that enterprises have limited access to external financing2. Just as in&#13;
most countries, firms have relied predominantly on internal as opposed to formal institutional&#13;
finance, including financing of start-ups. The same pattern is observed when financing post&#13;
start-up investments in land and buildings, and plant and machinery. Also, smaller enterprises&#13;
can be expected to incur higher transaction costs per unit of formal sector finance. However,&#13;
internal financing has historically been particularly large in Zimbabwe, with the bulk of&#13;
corporate investments having been undertaken using internally-generated funds, and the&#13;
corporate sector has been less dependent on the banking sector than common in other countries.&#13;
Hence, while credit was seen as important for small-scale and black-owned businesses, little&#13;
emphasis was placed on it as an overall investment constraint. However, around 1990, a large&#13;
shift in the structure of corporate finance occurred in response to the increased capital formation&#13;
and other uses of funds. Before 1990, only 23% of funds for investment were from sources&#13;
outside the firm. Since then, external sources have been dominant. Higher investment in&#13;
financial assets, as well as in inventory, and increased financing of trading partners, are behind&#13;
this widening need for external finance.&#13;
D. The Export Sector&#13;
2.16         Annual export growth in Zimbabwe has been only about 3%, and exports have&#13;
been heavily dependent on agricultural products and minerals, leaving the country vulnerable to&#13;
changes in commodity prices. However, as a result of some reduction in the anti-export bias,&#13;
there is evidence of increasing exporting activity in a number of non-traditional areas such as&#13;
horticulture, footwear, furniture, garments and textiles, chemicals, etc.; footwear and textiles&#13;
have experienced the largest increase in exports in recent years. Increasing import levels to meet&#13;
the development needs of the country, while at the same time reducing the deficit to sustainable&#13;
levels, will require aggressive action aimed at further increasing exports and diversifying the&#13;
export base.  Faster export growth, creating an additional exogenous source of aggregate&#13;
demand, is critical to sustain a higher overall growth rate. The growth of non-traditional and&#13;
2  For a description of the financial sector, see para. 3.1 below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
value-added exports is also critical to diversifying Zimbabwe's economic structure and exports,&#13;
thereby reducing vulnerability to external shocks. To generate this rapid increase in exports,&#13;
Zimbabwean firms need to become competitive with foreign producers, and exporting needs to&#13;
become as financially rewarding as selling on the local market. Only then can exporters&#13;
penetrate foreign market and attract investment. The recent depreciation of the Zimbabwean&#13;
dollar has done much to improve the relative profitability of export-oriented and efficient import&#13;
substituting activities, and the liberalization of imports has improved access to material inputs.&#13;
Moreover, trade liberalization, tax exemptions and the removal of investment licensing provide&#13;
ready access to capital goods at world prices. Yet, as indicated, while on the macro level&#13;
important measures have been adopted to support export expansion, exporters remain constrained&#13;
by remaining anti-export biases in the taxation of inputs, capital constrained for trade financing,&#13;
and a limited understanding by the exporters of the requirements of overseas markets. These&#13;
factors would be addressed by this project.&#13;
2.17        Trade Financing. Foreign currency-denominated export loans in Zimbabwe are&#13;
currently provided by merchant and, to a lesser degree, commercial banks for the shipment of&#13;
exports and imports, pre- and post-shipment, sourced from offshore credit lines, and generally&#13;
backed by "memorandum of deposit agreements" administered by the RBZ and regulated by the&#13;
Government External Loans Co-ordination Committee. These have been granted based on&#13;
Government's intention to ease the high interest rate burden of local currency loans on exporters.&#13;
Banks are "advised" by the RBZ that they should source at least 70% of the pre- and post-&#13;
shipment working capital requirements of any manufacturer engaged in export activity, based on&#13;
a confirmed export order from offshore sources, at an annual interest rate that is not higher than&#13;
LIBOR plus 0.875%, and on-lent to the exporter with the bank's indicative margin of 1% to 2%&#13;
for up to 180 to 270 days. Thus while two banks can source funds at below this rate, none can&#13;
exceed it under the memorandum of deposit agreement.&#13;
2.18        Yet while multiple facilities exist, there exists considerable evidence that a large&#13;
volume of potentially creditworthy exporters still have limited credit access.  Moreover,&#13;
continued high real interest rates create a brake on expansion of trade financing. Apparently,&#13;
foreign banks have been offering the offshore credit lines to Zimbabwe banks based on the above&#13;
guideline of the RBZ, under the understanding that benefiting exporters are well-established&#13;
companies with good credit standings. Those exporters who have poor credit standings with&#13;
banks due to their lack ofphysical collateral and track records, or those infant or SME exporters&#13;
for whom the banks are reluctant to commit resources to conduct thorough credit investigations,&#13;
would face these offshore credit line supply constraints, even if the banks would be willing to&#13;
grant export loans, based on confirmed export LICs and a revitalized Preshipment Export&#13;
Finance Guarantee coverage.  In turn, the Reserve Bank's own export finance scheme&#13;
(denominated in US$) has not been very effective in meeting the needs of SMEs or new&#13;
exporters. This is believed to be due to weaknesses in administration and marketing, each of&#13;
which would be addressed under the proposed project. The Zimbabwe Development Bank's&#13;
(ZDB's) export finance scheme is in a pilot stage, and appears to aim primarily at existing ZDB&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
2.19        Although post-shipment risk can be minimized by the use of instruments such as&#13;
irrevocable letters of credit, commercial banks face a more complex risk when extending pre-&#13;
shipment financing, i.e., that the exporter might not perform and might fail to get the goods on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
the ship, as specified in the letter of credit. In many countries, banks not used to handling such&#13;
risks are assisted, at least in the early years, by schemes of pre-shipment performance guarantees&#13;
which share this risk with the individual bank, so as to increase the bank's willingness to extend&#13;
pre-shipment financing to all new and expanding exporters holding firm orders. In Zimbabwe,&#13;
Credit Insurance of Zimbabwe (Credsure) provides select post-shipment cover for buyer and&#13;
political payment risks, or client insolvency, and does not issue exporter performance guarantees.&#13;
2.20         Successful exporters in other countries generally have had reliable access to&#13;
competitively-priced credit. An almost automatic pre- and post-shipment credit system that&#13;
works on the basis of confirmed orders and import letters of credit makes it much easier for local&#13;
firms to take advantage of foreign markets. While Zimbabwe already operates a very limited&#13;
export credit facility through Credsure, it has supported only three companies (see Annex C).&#13;
Moreover, the domestic currency cost of investment has been greatly increased by tight monetary&#13;
policy designed to contain inflation. A long-run solution must involve low inflation and modest&#13;
nominal as well as real interest rates. In the short-run, efforts such as those supported by this&#13;
project, are needed to increase the amount of financing to emerging exporters and make such&#13;
lending decisions more attractive to financial institutions.&#13;
E. Small and Medium Enterprises&#13;
2.21         Policy Framework.  Until the early 1990s, the policy enviromnent favored&#13;
existing enterprises, inhibiting entry and the broadening of participation. While measures&#13;
adopted since have removed many barriers, the benefits resulting from the ESAP are perceived to&#13;
flow disproportionately to the most privileged segments of the population. Yet the combination&#13;
of incentive reform and deregulation have created the opportunity both to increase the rate, and&#13;
alter the pattern of growth. It is crucial both to accelerate the rate of growth and broaden&#13;
participation in this growth -- broad-based growth will likely result in the greatest labor market&#13;
absorption.&#13;
2.22         Concentration and Participation. The level of concentration and structure of&#13;
ownership of industrial assets in Zimbabwe changed only slowly over the first decade after&#13;
independence, but the pace of this change appears to have increased over the last few years. An&#13;
important study by GEMINI3 found about 845,000 enterprises, a much larger number than&#13;
anticipated. Although the bulk of employment is accounted for under activities of "knitting and&#13;
crocheting", and "grass, cane and bamboo" categories, there is also a significant number of other&#13;
more sophisticated businesses. However, it is not yet clear what proportion of these activities are&#13;
merely for subsistence, and what proportion could form the basis for a dynamic small-and-&#13;
medium-scale enterprise sector.&#13;
2.23         The results of the RPED survey4 (Gunning (1994) indicated rising indigenous&#13;
black participation in formal manufacturing. Of the firms surveyed, 28% had African owners,&#13;
40% were white Zimbabwean-owned, and 11% had Asian owners. The ownership of the&#13;

- 10-&#13;
remaining 14% could not be ascertained and/or were firms owned by multinationals, the state&#13;
and cooperatives. Although the proportion of African ownership is low, there has been a&#13;
significant shift in terms of ownership structure since independence. While only 26% of white-&#13;
owned firms were started after 1980, almost 72% of the African-owned firms were started after&#13;
independence. Fifty-five percent of all firms started after 1989 were started by Africans.&#13;
However, most of the firms owned by Africans are still small compared to the firms owned by&#13;

firms employ less than 10 workers, and only 7% employ more than 100 workers.&#13;
2.24           Until 1991, not only did the policy regime strongly favor existing enterprises, so&#13;
too were significant barriers to finance identified for SMEs. Given the level of collateral&#13;
requirements and limited financial innovation, many SMEs with "bankable" projects found credit&#13;
access difficult. This was in spite of a number of donor-supported programs, as well as Small&#13;
Business Units established in each commercial bank to support this market. These units have a&#13;
lending responsibility to small-sized firms, generally those below a maximum of 50 employees,&#13;
and will intermediate loans referred to them by other branches.&#13;
2.25           The linkages between small- and medium-sized expansion of exports indicated in&#13;
Section D above and increasing the participation of indigenous business are significant: (i)&#13;
spillovers would likely occur to the extent that manufactured exporters source their input&#13;
requirements from domestic suppliers, in particular from SMEs; (ii) domestic producers&#13;
(including SMEs) could likely become indirect exporters as they provide finished goods to&#13;
producers that, in turn, export such products; (iii) small service enterprises would become&#13;
important beneficiaries of the increase in business in support services for exporting companies;&#13;
(iv) the nature of export growth in Zimbabwe would likely be relatively labor-intensive; and (v)&#13;
in the longer-term, export expansion generally leads to technological learning and productivity&#13;
gains by a broad array of enterprises.&#13;
2.26           SME Financing Constraints.  There are four sources of loan financing for&#13;
SMEs6: (i) commercial banks have in the past provided limited financing to SMEs through their&#13;
Small Business Units established for this purpose. These institutions have the branch networks,&#13;
5   Figures in parenthesis indicate the percentage of row tables. Source: RPED Survey, 1994.&#13;
6   While SMEs are defined in many ways, for our purposes we mean enterprises with approximately 10 to 100 employees.&#13;
Microenterprises having less than 10 employees are not excluded from the project but are not a primary focus of the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
staff, and financial resources to work towards the objective of making more substantial amounts&#13;
of funds available to indigenous businesses; (ii) although many NGOs are more focused on&#13;
microenterprises than SMEs, they tend to work well at the grassroots level and to lhave the&#13;
flexibility to undertake the character-based assessments of the principals of small businesses; (iii)&#13;
non-bank financial intermediaries potentially serve as additional mechanisms for intermediating&#13;
funds to SMEs but have done little to date; and (iv) state-owned intermediaries, such as the&#13;
Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), the Zimbabwe Development Bank (ZDB), and the&#13;
Small Enterprises Development Corporation (SEDCO), have provided financing.&#13;
2.27         SMEs face two important financial constraints: (i) lack of access to finance or&#13;
credit (particularly for the most dynamic indigenous enterprises); and (ii) a high cost of finance,&#13;
notably due to high real interest rates (10-20% in real terms during 1995). Both can constrain&#13;
enterprise performance. Surveys consistently identify high real interest rates as among the three&#13;
most binding constraints for all segments of the non-agricultural private sector. Gauging the&#13;
extent to which lack of access to finance is a binding constraint is complicated by the fact that&#13;
some firms that report lack of access to finance to be a binding constraint may not be&#13;
creditworthy, and hence ought not to be advanced loan finance; and, given high real interest&#13;
rates, many of those potentially creditworthy firms that might experience problems gaining&#13;
access to finance, simply self-select by choosing not to borrow.&#13;
2.28         Various factors are believed to have contributed to the observed credit constraint&#13;
for investors, particularly SMEs. The dualist economic structure and limited interaction between&#13;
the banking community and the emerging SME sector have resulted in the perceived risks of&#13;
financing SMEs being considerably greater than the actual risks. This is supported by data in a&#13;
recent survey of black-owned businesses in Zimbabwe7. Information asymmetries are usually&#13;
worse for small enterprises, and likely impair the functioning of the financial markets and cause&#13;
the cost of borrowing to be pushed up. This cost manifests itself in higher interest rates&#13;
reflecting higher risks and transaction costs as well as, typically, a greater reliance by financial&#13;
institutions on physical collateral. It is in this setting that the above survey indicates that vital&#13;
role that State-owned financial institutions played in providing initial support to enterprises&#13;
which, because of the risk perceptions of private financial institutions indicated, would not have&#13;
otherwise had credit access. Indeed, of 47 enterprises sampled which had used loans, 36 had&#13;
received loans or guarantees from one or more parastatal or non-profit organizations, including&#13;
18 from SEDCO. Implicitly, this also suggests a certain technical assistance and appraisal&#13;
capability to support emerging SMEs. In this way, deliberate measures to reduce this financing&#13;
constraint had a demonstrated impact.&#13;
F. Business Support Services - Information Linkages and Market Intelligence&#13;
2.29         The nature of business associations in Zimbabwe has to date reflected the dualism&#13;
in the economic structure: Associations controlled by whites generally catered to large existing&#13;
industrial and agricultural concerns and have had little interaction with associations which&#13;
catered to blacks, which generally catered to smaller businesses and more subsistence-based&#13;
agriculture. The outreach between these two types of associations has been limited, with blacks&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and whites grouped with their own associations. Moreover, many associations also have&#13;
histories which included an actively political, in addition to an economic mandate.&#13;
2.30        In Zimbabwe, not enough attention has been devoted to developing business skills&#13;
which respond to buyer preferences, innovation, production efficiency, quality control and&#13;
marketing. As a result of long years of domestic orientation and protection from external&#13;
markets, many Zimbabwean firms lack the required skills, know-how, and market understanding&#13;
which is essential for obtaining orders in new markets. The returns from improving the&#13;
information base and, accordingly, upgrading supply capabilities by addressing deficiencies, are&#13;
very large. Supply performance is critical in exporting manufactured products to developed&#13;
country markets and, for firms looking for export orders, what counts is the buyer's perception of&#13;
the exporting firm's supply capabilities and its readiness to fulfill all aspects of the order. In the&#13;
same vein, strong evidence suggests that SMEs can be strengthened by measures to create greater&#13;
information linkages for individual enterprises, and the project would seek to develop these&#13;
mechanisms as well.&#13;
2.31        Presently, several agencies in Zimbabwe attempt to provide such information and&#13;
assistance to exporters. ZimTrade, a trade promotion organization, has made a good start in&#13;
conducting market and supply surveys, encouraging group participation in foreign trade fairs,&#13;
providing training courses for new exporters, and developing newsletters, promotional brochures&#13;
and exporter directories. In addition, it has developed a trade and information center which&#13;
attempts to provide up-to-date information on international market trends and developments.&#13;
Several specialized databases are available on-line to potential exporters and are fully&#13;
computerized, allowing for speedy location of specific publications through a keyword search&#13;
system. Further, ZimTrade maintains a comprehensive library of up-to-date international trade&#13;
directories, market reports, country reports, customs regulations, product specific journals and&#13;
market studies. From a slow start, ZimTrade gets upwards of 300-400 visitors per month using&#13;
its database, in addition to numerous phone inquiries, and has recently opened an office in&#13;
Bulawayo. Besides ZimTrade, several other private sector organizations are emerging as sources&#13;
of information and specialized assistance such as the Horticultural Promotion Council, the&#13;
confederation of Zimbabwe industries, and the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce, in&#13;
addition to private service and financial firms. All of these perform a variety of export&#13;
promotion functions relating to advice, training and information. The further development of&#13;
such trade promotion functions needs to be supported and information dissemination encouraged.&#13;
2.32        Generally, firms need individualized help, geared to their specific market niche&#13;
opportunities, and most of this help needs to be provided from the viewpoint of a distant&#13;
potential buyer. Such help is therefore not easy to deliver. One mechanism to deal with this&#13;
problem successfully is the matching grant concept offered on a pilot basis in Zimbabwe by&#13;
ZimTrade, with support from the European Union (EU) through the Export Promotion Support&#13;
Services (EPSS) program. These grants cover up to half the cost of a firm's program to improve&#13;
and adapt its supply, market development, and potentially related export development operations.&#13;
Firms can use the grants to help pay for expert services and travel associated with market&#13;
exploration and initial marketing. Making the participating company pay 50% of the costs&#13;
involved ensures that the firm has a financial stake in getting value for money.&#13;

2.33        Analysis of SMEs in developing countries suggests that a powerful learning&#13;
mechanism for emerging enterprises is learning from ongoing business activities. However,&#13;
evidence suggests that this mechanism works only to the extent that firms are embedded in&#13;
"information-rich" private networks. In Zimbabwe's dualistic setting, even potentially dynamic&#13;
small entrepreneurs may not have access to these networks, and hence, could find themselves&#13;
trapped (without necessarily being conscious of the root of their problem) in a low-level "poor-&#13;
but-efficient" setting. The challenge is to find ways of enhancing the access of indigenous and&#13;
other firms to information-rich networks, without creating white elephant public institutions.&#13;
While internationally the examples of success are, at best, limited, three approaches have been&#13;
incorporated into the Project to create information linkages needed (see paras. 4.5 to 4.8 below).&#13;
2.34        The current array of business support services available for SMEs is limited, and&#13;
those that are available are fragmented. Training is offered by a number of agencies or NGOs&#13;
including SEDCO, AFC, EMPRETEC and others.  Moreover, ZimTrade offers limited&#13;
introductory exposure for SMEs. The Government has also channeled considerable sums of&#13;
funds into the business services sector to assist retrenched civil servants.&#13;
3. FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THEIR REGULATION&#13;
3.1         Structure of the Financial Sector. Zimbabwe generally has a highly-developed&#13;
financial system compared to other countries in the region. Financial institutions that lend directly&#13;
to the public are comprised of five commercial banks (Barclays, Standard Chartered, Zimbank,&#13;
Stanbic and the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe), five finance houses (Stanbic Finance, Fincor,&#13;
UDC, Standard Finance, and Scotfin), three building societies (Central African Building Society,&#13;
Founders Building Society and Beverly Building Society), two development finance institutions&#13;
(SEDCO and ZDB), and nine merchant banks. There is also a government-owned Credit&#13;
Guarantee Company (CGC-Second Tier) and the Post Office Savings Bank. The Reserve Bank of&#13;
Zimbabwe (RBZ) is the monetary and regulatory authority. The Government has a controlling&#13;
interest in Zimbank and its subsidiaries, Syfrets and Scotfin, in the Commercial Bank of&#13;
Zimbabwe, in ZDB and in SEDCO. In addition, the system comprises a stock exchange, over 50&#13;
insurance companies and a large number of pension funds.&#13;
3.2         Economic Regulation and Monetary Policy. Since 1992, economic regulations&#13;
on financial instruments have been almost entirely removed. The severity of high real deposit&#13;
and lending rates indicated in Table 2 below, reflects Government's contractionary monetary&#13;
policy both to reduce inflation and protect the balance of payments, in the face of continuing and&#13;
accumulated fiscal deficits. The real average lending rate of 11.8% indicated makes the debt-&#13;
service requirements for sub-loan financing particularly difficult for commercial customers.&#13;
Such rates are projected to be reduced in the medium-term, but such a reduction will depend on&#13;
achieving an improved fiscal position and a market response to Government policies. Spreads&#13;
are also very high, given Zimbabwe's required reserve and liquidity requirements, averaging&#13;
almost 8% for commercial banks. Strong financial margins and returns on capital invested in the&#13;
financial sector suggest that Zimbabwe could be attractive to new entrants. This is validated by&#13;
the recent entrance of one commercial bank (purchasing an existing bank) and the establishment&#13;
of four merchant banks in the last two years.&#13;

3.3                  Savings and Financial Depth. Broad Money (M2) was 26.7% of GDP in 1993&#13;
and is projected to increase to between 28.2% and 29.5% from 1995 to 1997. Total commercial&#13;
bank loans and advances were about US$ 1.1 billion at end-June, 1995, while loans, advances and&#13;
acceptances of merchant banks was about US$400 million. The level of financial depth can be&#13;
considered only moderate, given Zimbabwe's income level and distribution. The bulk of formal&#13;
savings in financial institutions (not including pension funds or insurance companies) is in&#13;
commercial banks, which held 80% of such savings at end-July, 1995. Merchant banks held&#13;
15% and discount houses just over five percent. Approximately 11% of savings was held in&#13;
Foreign Currency Accounts (FCAs). Savings is also skewed towards demand deposits (48% of&#13;
total deposits) with savings deposits under thirty days comprising 40% and time deposits over 30&#13;
days comprising 12% of deposits. The large volume of demand deposits is in part accentuated to&#13;
the degree that such deposits are used against overdraft accounts for corporate customers.&#13;
3.4                 Ownership  and  Competition.   Historically, financial institutions have  largely&#13;
reflected the duality of ownership observed in the real sector: Most institutions catered to&#13;
existing companies and agricultural interests (for domestic market and financing exports),&#13;
primarily owned by whites, while State-owned institutions attempted to finance indigenous&#13;
emerging enterprises and farmers. Economic regulations contributed to conservative lending&#13;
policies in that: (i) repressed lending rates contributed to lending to known or affiliated&#13;
customers; and (ii) former entry barriers contributed to limited competition assuring a reasonable&#13;
profit with little risk-taking. In 1988, with the encouragement of the RBZ, commercial banks set&#13;
up Small Business Units, (SBUs) whose aim was to cater to nascent indigenous enterprises.&#13;
These Units functioned in a very limited way until about 1994, when the effects of domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
market liberalization increased some of the interest of commercial banks in pursuing the SME&#13;
market.&#13;
3.5            Prudential Regulation and Supervision. Zimbabwe's formal financial sector is&#13;
regulated by the RBZ, which is responsible for monetary and foreign exchange policy. The&#13;
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Act of 1964, and the Banking Act of 1968, give the RBZ broad&#13;
powers to regulate commercial banks, discount houses, and merchant banks and finance houses,&#13;
as well as empowering the RBZ to carry out its central banking functions8. These functions&#13;
include responsibility over the money supply, issuing currency, providing clearing house facilities,&#13;
administering Government loans and securities, and acting as custodian of the country's foreign&#13;
exchange reserves and managing the country's gold output. RBZ's financial dealings with other&#13;
intermediaries is through discount houses that trade in bankers' acceptances, negotiable&#13;
certificates of deposit (NCDs), and government treasuries and municipal notes in the secondary&#13;
market. In general, RBZ has influenced the banking system to control the money supply, but has&#13;
had very limited powers to supervise and control prudential regulations.&#13;
3.6            Under current law, RBZ has the authority to issue statutory prudential regulations&#13;
for banking institutions, but has no authority to carry out on-site inspection, and limited authority&#13;
to require information for surveillance purposes9. The main statutory requirements for the&#13;
banking system cover minimum capital and reserves and minimum reserve and liquidity&#13;
balances. Operational guidelines include gearing ratios, overall risk asset ratios, maximum&#13;
exposure in any one customer or related group of customers, and monitoring of foreign exchange&#13;
dealings by the banking system. At end-October, 1995, guidelines were also established for&#13;
capital adequacy and loan classification and provisioning, albeit the legal authority of such&#13;
guidelines is limited to moral suasion.&#13;
3.7            A draft revised Banking Act before Parliament would amend current legislation&#13;
governing deposit-taking institutions and the financial services industry. As such, the regulatory&#13;
authority of the RBZ Banking Supervision Department would increase significantly, including&#13;
the legal authority for on-site supervision. Moreover, the coverage of its authority would be&#13;
widened to include finance houses and building societies.  Further, capital requirements,&#13;
including risk-related capital adequacy ratios and other prudential legislation for all financial&#13;
institutions, would be statutorily required to be met. Finally, segmentation of the banking system&#13;
under current law would be eliminated. The legislation would also lay the foundation for the&#13;
emergence of new money-market instruments and financial services. The implications of such&#13;
legislation would be that the RBZ Banking Supervision Department would have to be&#13;
strengthened considerably (see para 4.22).&#13;
3.8            Financial Market Development and  Outreach  to Emerging  Enterprises.&#13;
Zimbabwe's financial markets are in a transition. Although relatively complex, sophisticated and&#13;
8   Currently. the Post Office Savings Bank is regulated by the Post Office Savings Bank Act (Chapter 249) and falls under&#13;
the joint trusteeship of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Postmaster General. The&#13;
Building Societies are regulated by the Buildings Societies Act. Other institutions, including insurance companies, pension&#13;
funds, etc., are subject to their individual legislation and governed by independent boards.&#13;
9   It is in light of these legal limitations that the Project includes the application of specific eligibility criteria for the&#13;
participation of financial intermediaries under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
diverse by regional standards, the outreach to lending to emerging enterprises both for local and&#13;
export markets has been limited. Conservative lending policies have to date focused on the&#13;
maintenance of collateral, often through fixed assets (land) or movable assets. Little lending has&#13;
to date been done purely on a cashflow basis, except for large and well-established exporters.&#13;
Given that the level of perceived risks of emerging enterprises is believed to be greater than their&#13;
actual risk, it is expected that, once financial institutions develop greater experience with cash-&#13;
flow lending and improve their appraisal capability and information networks, then more lending&#13;
will go to the to-date disenfranchised groups. Although the experience of most financial&#13;
institutions in project appraisal of SMEs is limited, this capacity is believed to be sufficient to&#13;
effectively draw upon, channel,-and benefit from financing and guarantee mechanisms set up to&#13;
support emerging enterprises under the Project. The same is even more the case in terms of&#13;
export financing, where the expertise is there, albeit the willingness to provide cashflow-based&#13;
export financing has been limited. Most important, if the reforms indicated above are developed,&#13;
namely, improvement in prudential regulations so as to permit an orderly entrance of more&#13;
competition, and an improved macro program so as to reduce interest rates on a sustainable&#13;
basis, it is then e-xpected that, in the medium-term, the financial markets will have adjusted in&#13;
such a way as to finance emerging enterprises on their own accord.&#13;
4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin and Relation with Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
4.1         This project stems from discussions held in October and November 1994, in&#13;
which the Government and IDA agreed to develop an integrated enterprise support program&#13;
including credit, business services and institutional development.  A process of Annual&#13;
Consultations was also established in January 1995, whereby Bank staff and Government&#13;
officials discuss the assistance program, in an effort to strengthen early collaboration, and avoid&#13;
investing a lot of resources in preparing operations before Government commitment is&#13;
established. These meetings, a Borrower feedback survey in mid-1995 and consultations with&#13;
stakeholder groups (civil society, NGOs, academics, private sector, labor and government) in&#13;
February 1996, have also been an integral part of the preparation of a Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy.&#13;
4.2         The last Country Assistance Strategy for Zimbabwe was discussed with the&#13;
Board in January 1994. A key element of that strategy was to support the Government's efforts&#13;
to promote private sector investment and exports as the engine for employment generation and&#13;
growth. Instruments for providing support were to include additional adjustment lending, a&#13;
country economic memorandum, a trade expansion study and a small and microenterprise&#13;
development (SMSE) project.  The next adjustment operation has been deferred pending&#13;
fulfillment of remaining measures for release of the second tranche of the Second Structural&#13;
Adjustment Credit (FY93), the studies have been completed and the SMSE Project has evolved&#13;
into this project, the Enterprise Development Project. A new Country Assistance Strategy had&#13;
been planned for consideration by the Board with this Project. However, intervening events,&#13;
including the recent presidential elections, argued for deferring presentation of a new strategy&#13;
pending Government's elaboration of the next phase of its adjustment program (ESAP 2) and&#13;
further discussions on the Bank's role in supporting the program. The ongoing strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
continues to include private sector and export development, particularly among indigenous&#13;
enterprises, as key to the overall objective of broad based growth. Apart from the proposed&#13;
project, other relevant interventions would cover agriculture, focusing inter alia on rebuilding&#13;
services for the smallholder and small-scale irrigation. Other prongs of the strategy include&#13;
continued support for macroeconomic reform and stability; human resource development,&#13;
particularly health which is threatened by fiscal constraints and AIDS/HIV; infrastructure&#13;
development, as the backbone for private sector development and development in the rural areas;&#13;
environment and resource management, including particularly water resources; and capacity&#13;
building, particularly at the local government level.&#13;
B. Lessons Learned From Past Experience&#13;
4.3           The project aims to draw  on the results of financial intermediary projects,&#13;
including the recently completed Small Scale Enterprise Project in Zimbabwe, which have often&#13;
had limited results because: (i) subsidy mechanisms or sector targeting often did not have a&#13;
desired sustainable real sector impact; and (ii) reliance on a limited scope of financial&#13;
intermediaries did not result in the breadth or depth of financial intermediation needed,&#13;
particularly for reaching emerging enterprises, because of lending conservatism and information&#13;
asymmetries. Specific lessons for the Zimbabwe project were: (i) micro-level support of SMEs&#13;
cannot lead to a sustainable result unless the macro, policy and institutional barriers to SME&#13;
development are also addressed. These constraints put a brake on SME development in the&#13;
1980s; (ii) using a unique financial intermediary such as SEDCO can help to develop the&#13;
expertise of SME lending, but it does not result in the establishment of such an expertise in the&#13;
broader commercial marketplace on a sustainable basis; (iii) access to credit by financial&#13;
intermediaries requires continuing compliance with explicit eligibility criteria; and (iv) lending&#13;
rates both to and from intermediaries should be comparable to market rates and positive in real&#13;
terms to avoid financial and real market distortions. Further, the project aims to draw upon&#13;
specific lessons in the provision of business services, namely that: (i) to the degree possible,&#13;
lending and technical assistance to borrowers should be separated functions; (ii) provision of&#13;
information and management services should be specialized and tailored to the firm or&#13;
association's needs -- generalized training should be avoided; and (iii) foreign and domestic&#13;
businesses themselves can serve as important catalysts for other firms embarking on export or&#13;
other business expansion. Finally, the project aims to build upon the lessons of institutional&#13;
development as it relates to improving customs administration and financial institution&#13;
management of credit operations. This project aims to achieve success where the earlier project&#13;
had more limited results by: (i) providing financing and business services to enterprises, in this&#13;
case after most of the identified policy barriers have been removed; (ii) intermediating funds&#13;
through multiple institutions certified as financially viable by external auditors; and (iii)&#13;
supporting an integrated series of measures which encompass financing, guarantees, business&#13;
services and institution-building.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
4.4           The objective of this project is to support a stronger supply response by private&#13;
sector enterprises to policy reforms undertaken, including: (i) increasing the growth of export-&#13;
based output; and (ii) broadening participation in economic activity, in particular by indigenous&#13;
firms.&#13;

D. Project Description'°&#13;
1. The Business Services Component&#13;
4.5          Given the duality described above in the existing structure of business&#13;
associations and the identified collective benefits to improving information linkages, the Project&#13;
supports a Business Services Component consisting of: (i) a Subsector Business Associations&#13;
Initiative (SBAI) providing matching grants to business associations to support their efforts to&#13;
strengthen their array of services for firms, including creation of company alliances; (ii) support of&#13;
an enhancement of an existing ZimTrade Matching Grant Scheme for individual enterprises&#13;
entering or expanding into export markets; and (iii) support of the initial costs of creating linkages&#13;
between established and emerging enterprises through a Matchmaking Facility. A more detailed&#13;
description is indicated below and in Annex A.&#13;
4.6          Support to Subsector Business Associations- SBAI (Project Cost US$3.1&#13;
million, of which IDA would finance US$1.4 million). The SBAI would provide financing to&#13;
"kickstart" the emergence of service-oriented Zimbabwean subsector business associations --&#13;
groupings of firms engaged in similar activities, typically manufacturing or services. The&#13;
program would be managed by an SBAI Administrator supported under the project and would&#13;
support subsector associations in the preparation of technical and marketing programs which aim&#13;
to improve the competitiveness and productivity of firms through: (i) direct provision of&#13;
development support to associations through "handholding" in designing a business plan. This&#13;
support is aimed at those associations that do not yet have the capability to design focused&#13;
strengthening programs themselves; (ii) provision of 50:50 matching grants providing&#13;
development support for 12 months to cover the costs of a subsector association staff person&#13;
specialized in the concerns of the relevant subsector. This person could be full- or part-time, and&#13;
could be shared with one other subsector association; and (iii) the provision of program&#13;
matching funds, on a cost sharing basis (25% paid by participating firms, and 75% covered by&#13;
the project) for eligible programs mounted by the associations (see Annex A for guidelines for&#13;
these programs). Both the development support and program matching grants are intended as&#13;
catalysts -- demonstrations to firms in the relevant subsectors, and to the private sector more&#13;
broadly, of the benefits of strong, productivity-oriented subsector associations. In cases where,&#13;
for reasons of Zimbabwe's history, there exists more than one association for a particular&#13;
activity, the component will endeavor to foster collaboration among these associations. The&#13;
expectation is that, having once experienced the benefits to be derived from such associations,&#13;
firms will then be willing to continue to participate in them, unsupported by SBAI grants.&#13;
Consequently, the scheme is designed to be temporary, to operate only for a single, three-year&#13;
period.&#13;
4.7          Support to Improving International Competitiveness (Project Cost US$7.3&#13;
million of which IDA would finance US$3.8 million). The ZimTrade Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
(ZMGS) would provide support to enterprises seeking to expand their international&#13;
competitiveness. Matching grants would be supported under the Project on a 50:50 cost-sharing&#13;
basis (with private firms) to stimulate the use of foreign and domestic support services and travel&#13;

- 19-&#13;
by firms so as to speed up a firm-level response. Support services quickly introduce into firms&#13;
the skills, know-how, information and contacts that will be needed, in order either to defend&#13;
against import competition, or to expand exports. Travel by key personnel helps to build realism&#13;
about how best the firm can find its niche in an international marketplace, establishing contacts&#13;
both with export outlets and with sources of imported inputs that could help build&#13;
competitiveness. Cost-sharing grants would be provided on the basis of a plan prepared by the&#13;
firm (see Annex A for complete guidelines). The ZMGS would also support the process of&#13;
restructuring by working in a "hands-on" way with firms to prepare firm-level plans, aimed at&#13;
enhancing competitiveness (involving support services and travel to be supported by the ZMGS).&#13;
The scheme would seek to add to, strengthen, and build upon a foundation of the current Export&#13;
Promotion Support Service (EPSS) offered by ZimTrade. The scheme represents a reformulation&#13;
of the existing scheme, as well as an upgrading and extension of the program. The scheme&#13;
would be managed by the ZMGS Management Team who will have the global knowledge and&#13;
private sector experience that can help fill the gaps in firms' knowledge, assisting in proactively&#13;
promoting the scheme to owners and senior managers of private firms, concentrating on those&#13;
assessed as having the highest potential for building international competitiveness. Approval of&#13;
ZMGS matching grants will be made by the ZMGS Management Team, a Technical Adviser and,&#13;
depending upon the size of the grant, in some cases by the Steering Team of the Project. It is&#13;
expected that about 80% of grant support will go towards technical and productivity adjustments&#13;
within the factory and about 20% will directly support efforts at marketing. The cost-sharing and&#13;
proactive, hands-on initiatives are intended as catalysts -- demonstrations to participating firms,&#13;
and, more broadly, to the private sector -- of the benefits of actively seeking out external sources&#13;
of information and know-how.&#13;
4.8         Export Catalysts through Matchmaking (Project Cost US$3.1 million, of which&#13;
IDA would finance US$1.8 million). The Matchmaking Facility aims to build Zimbabwean&#13;
firms' export capability by facilitating export-oriented enterprise collaboration between small and&#13;
medium local and foreign partners through a private matchmaking scheme. Foreign partners&#13;
would bring a package of external market access and production know-how with or without&#13;
investment finance. The facility would provide matching grant support as one effective way to&#13;
deal with local potential exporters' lack of: (i) access to the external market network and market&#13;
information for export products; (ii) access to exportable production know-how; and (iii) access&#13;
to external information on input sourcing to promote export-oriented foreign enterprise&#13;
collaboration in diversified forms. The collaborations supported through this facility provide a&#13;
package of (i) - (iii), offer an opportunity for local partners' immediate entry into the world&#13;
market, and offer an opportunity for the acquisition of skills in these areas. Under the facility, a&#13;
private matchmaker would identify potential foreign collaborators, brokering information on&#13;
business opportunities in the recipient country, and use their information network in the latter&#13;
country to link foreign collaborators with potential local partners. The fee provided to the&#13;
matchmaker would be based on the culmination of a collaboration contract which is&#13;
performance-based. Matchmaking fee payments would be shared between: (i) the Matchmaking&#13;
Fund (MMF) established under the Project (50% of the initial installment); (ii) the foreign&#13;
partner (25% of the initial installment); and (iii) the local exporter (25% of the initial&#13;
installment). Installments would be based on the contract value and implementation stages (see&#13;
Annex A for Guidelines). Funding would also be provided to support the costs of establishing an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
initial contact between the matchmaker, foreign collaborator and local partner. The facility&#13;
would be managed by a Matchmaking Management Contractor, with input and support from a&#13;
Technical Adviser.&#13;
2. The Finance Component&#13;
4.9         The Finance Component supports permanent working capital and investment&#13;
financing for SMEs, US$ export financing for direct or indirect exporters, and SME and&#13;
Preshipment Export Finance guarantee funds established (and backstopped) under the project as&#13;
indicated below. Funds under this component would be intermediated by Participating Financial&#13;
Intermediaries (PFIs), who would be certified as eligible for participation by the Project Steering&#13;
leam, upon the recommendation and on the basis of information presented by independent&#13;
external auditors commissioned for this purpose (see Annex B for the criteria and evaluation&#13;
procedures). Funds would be intermediated through an Apex Unit in the RBZ (See para. 4.34&#13;
below) and the Guarantee Funds would operate in a Credit Guarantee Agency (CGA), also in the&#13;
RBZ.&#13;
4.10        SME Finance Facility - Fund (Project Cost US$31.1 million of which IDA&#13;
would finance US$25 million). Uncertainty and the term structure of interest rates has led to&#13;
limited and prohibitively-priced medium-term funds for financial institutions to fumd the&#13;
investment and permanent working capital needs of their SME customers. The SME Finance&#13;
Fund seeks to provide an intervention to relax the constraint for term funding by financial&#13;
institutions for SMEs. The aim is that by providing financing to SMEs capable of sustainable&#13;
growth, these enterprises can grow and generate employment on a sustainable basis. Eligible&#13;
borrowers would include companies with up to 50 employees and with up to US$200,000 in&#13;
assets (exclusive of land), with sub-loans up to a limit of US$75,000 (see Annex B for more&#13;
detailed guidelines). The Project Steering Team (see para. 4.31) could, in consultation with IDA,&#13;
modify this limit according to implementation experience. Funds would be offered to SMEs by&#13;
participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) in Zim$ at a maturity of up to five years, and with up&#13;
to 18 months' grace period. PFIs would be required to onlend to SMEs funds in the same&#13;
currency and with the same maturity and grace period as received from the Apex. At least 20%&#13;
of the subproject cost would need to be met by sub-borrowers. The interest rate charged by the&#13;
Apex to financial intermediaries would be the average cost of funds of commercial banks, as&#13;
determined by a quarterly rolling average, computed by the RBZ and announced quarterly. The&#13;
rate charged SMEs by PFIs would be freely determined by PFIs in accordance with the costs and&#13;
risks involved. Sub-project documentation submitted to the Apex would be limited to summary&#13;
information.&#13;
4.11        Central to the demand estimates for the SME Finance Fund is the assumption that&#13;
the process being supported entails marginal financing which would otherwise not be&#13;
undertaken. The "financing gap" is virtually impossible to determine for SMEs in this context&#13;
because of the dynamic nature of changes in demand, and in the supply response due to the&#13;
process being supported. Under the assumption that the average SME credit would be&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent, the sub-component would finance approximately 500 new SME&#13;
borrowers over a four-year period. This would represent an increase of approximately 2.2% from&#13;
the US$1.1 billion of loans and advances of commercial banks (end-July 1995). Although the&#13;
exact size of commercial banks' SME portfolios is not known, if estimates are valid that SME&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
exposure is only five percent of total portfolios, new SME sub-loans under the project would&#13;
represent a significant increase. If the process is sufficiently dynamic, the hope is that there will&#13;
be a supply response in the sense that financial institutions will divert an increasing share of their&#13;
own-sourced funds to finance this market.&#13;
4.12         SME Credit Guarantee Facility - Fund (Cost US$5.6 million"l financed by the&#13;
Government and private sector). The Project will support an SME Credit Guarantee in order to&#13;
encourage financial institutions to lend to entrepreneurs with viable projects and good prospects&#13;
of success, but whose perceived risk is greater than their actual risk because the borrowers are&#13;
unable to provide adequate collateral, or do not have a suitable credit history to prove that they&#13;
are creditworthy. Eligible SME sub-loans financed by the SME Finance Fund could be&#13;
guaranteed for 50% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest up to 90 days,&#13;
provided a PFI's losses for guaranteed loans have not exceeded 15% of its guaranteed sub-loan&#13;
total. New loans made once this threshold has been reached (but losses less than 40%) could be&#13;
guaranteed at a rate of 25%. No additional loans would be guaranteed if a PFI's loss rate on&#13;
guaranteed loans exceeds 40%. Each PFI would pay the Apex a three percent premium on the&#13;
guaranteed portion of its portfolio--a premium that could be passed along to PFI borrowers.&#13;
4.13         Both the SME Credit Guarantee and the Preshipment Export Finance Guarantee&#13;
(below) would be administered by a Credit Guarantee Agency (CGA) located in the RBZ and&#13;
actively interacting with the Apex. The CGA would be responsible for processing guarantee&#13;
applications, verifying borrower compliance with eligibility conditions, verifying eligibility of&#13;
PFIs, processing receipt of premiums, scrutinizing requests for claims under the guarantee, and&#13;
processing reimbursement under such claims. The CGA would issue a Guarantee Certificate to&#13;
the PFI for guaranteed sub-loans. The scheme's design is intended to be simple enough so that&#13;
participation does not add materially to a PFI's transaction costs. The aim of this mechanism is&#13;
to be temporary until such time as financial institutions are better able to assess, price and&#13;
manage risk when no special incentive would be needed.&#13;
4.14         The SME Credit Guarantee Fund (and Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantee&#13;
Fund below) would be funded by: (i) premiums collected by the Apex from PFIs deposited into&#13;
an interest-bearing deposit account; (ii) interest from such account; (iii) any funds recovered in&#13;
the disposal of collateral on guaranteed-loans; and, as necessary; (iv) sub-loan recoveries from&#13;
the SME and Export Finance funds transferred from the SME Finance Fund to the SME Credit&#13;
Guarantee Fund"2. Once a sub-loan is confirmed by the CGA as being entitled to reimbursement&#13;
under a claim, the Apex would debit the Guarantee Fund account and credit the PFI's project&#13;
account for the compensated balance. This would effectively exonerate the PFI from repayment&#13;
to the RBZ for 50% (or less) of the outstanding balance of the defaulting sub-loan.&#13;
4.15         Export Finance Facility - Fund (Project Cost US$43.8 million of which IDA&#13;
wouldfinance US$35 million). This fund would support pre- and post-shipment export financing&#13;
(generally imported inputs and local content which go into exported products) for emerging&#13;
exporters unable to access such financing from commercial sources. Under existing financing&#13;
I I The actual cost will depend on the level of defaults of SME loans (note the financing mechanism below).&#13;
12  Projections for the SME Credit Guarantee Fund are indicated in Annex B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
arrangements for commercial and merchant banks in Zimbabwe, overseas funding sources have&#13;
often stipulated that foreign currency funds should be used by local institutions only for well-&#13;
established exporters. This has had the effect of limiting the financing for emerging exporters,&#13;
for whom the Export Finance Fund seeks to relax this foreign currency funding constraint.&#13;
Eligible borrowers would include companies with up to 100 employees and with up to&#13;
US$500,000 in assets (exclusive of land). Sub-loans would be financed up to a size limit of&#13;
US$150,000 (see Annex B for more detailed guidelines). The Project Steering Team (See para.&#13;
4.31) could, in consultation with IDA, modify this limit according to implementation experience.&#13;
Funds would be offered to exporters by PFIs in US$ at a maturity from the time of drawdown to&#13;
the time of the sight export L/C negotiation (or post-shipment export bill discount), but not more&#13;
than six months (pre-shipment) or 120 days (post-shipment). Borrowers would be required to&#13;
have a confirmed export letter of credit from a top-quality bank, export credit insurance, or, in&#13;
the case of indirect exporters, a domestic back-to-back L/C. Post-shipment financing would be&#13;
provided by rolling over the pre-shipment maturity into the post-shipment phase. PFIs would be&#13;
required to onlend funds in the same currency and with the same maturity as received from the&#13;
Apex. At least 20% of the subproject cost would need to be met by the sub-borrowers. The&#13;
interest rate charged by the Apex to financial intermediaries would be the average cost of US$&#13;
funding of commercial and merchant banks from overseas sources, as determined by a quarterly&#13;
rolling average, computed by the RBZ and announced quarterly.  Currently, the ceiling&#13;
established by the RBZ for offshore credit lines for export loans is LIBOR + 0.875%, which&#13;
would be the initial rate charged on funds of the line, subject to change by the Steering Team in&#13;
accordance with changes in RBZ regulations and market conditions. The rate charged exporters&#13;
by PFIs would be freely determined by PFIs in accordance with the costs and risks involved.&#13;
The aim of subproject documentation would be to summarize the financed transaction to submit&#13;
to the Apex.&#13;
4.16        Demand estimates for the Export Finance Fund are difficult to determine for&#13;
emerging exporters because of the dynamic nature of changes in demand and in the supply&#13;
response due to the changing process being supported. The amount of the Export Finance Fund&#13;
(US$35 million) is based on the following analysis: Total outstanding pre- and post-shipment&#13;
non-tobacco export loans based on offshore credit lines of commercial and merchant banks at the&#13;
middle of June, 1995 were approximately US$250 million (US$167 million under memorandum&#13;
of deposit agreements'3 with the RBZ and the remaining US$83 million for general exports and&#13;
export-related imports without the agreement). It is estimated that these export loans based on&#13;
offshore credit lines have been granted mainly to 300 to 400 well-established companies in the&#13;
non-tobacco primary and manufacturing sectors. This amount supplies approximately 1/3 to 1/2&#13;
of the total non-tobacco (also excluding cotton and gold) export finance needs. The remaining&#13;
export finance needs (1/2 to 2/3 of the total - US$250-500 million) must be met by either Zim$&#13;
loans with high rates or self-financed for the remaining exporters (estimated to be more than&#13;
1,000). Such financing is very difficult for emerging exporters, even when they have confirmed&#13;
export letters of credit. Project funds can fill a portion of this "financing gap". Under the&#13;
assumption that the average Export Finance credit would be US$100,000, the sub-component&#13;
would finance approximately 350 new exporters over a four-year period. This would represent&#13;
an increase of approximately 2.3% in loans from the US$1.5 billion of loans, advances and&#13;
acceptances of commercial and merchant banks (end-July 1995). Alternatively, this would&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
represent between 7% and 14% of the total amount of export finance estimated to be currently&#13;
self-financed or financed by domestic currency loans. While this amount represents a small&#13;
increase in these institutions' overall exposure, given the limited volume of exports from firms in&#13;
Zimbabwe with under 100 employees, it will represent a significant inroad into this nascent&#13;
market.&#13;
4.17        An Export Finance Guarantee Facility - Fund (estimated Cost US$7.5 million&#13;
financed by the Government and private sector). The project would support a Preshipment&#13;
Export Finance Guarantee Facility whose purpose is to encourage financial institutions, through&#13;
risk reduction, to lend to emerging exporters holding confirmed overseas export letters of credit&#13;
or specified buyers' non-payment risk insurance for confirmed orders. Such export projects&#13;
financed likely show good prospects of success (as evidenced by the export L/C), but the PFI is&#13;
reticent to extend funding because of limited collateral or credit history. The Export Credit&#13;
Guarantee Fund would operate in a similar way for export finance as for SMEs as indicated in&#13;
paras. 4.12 to 4.14 above. Eligible sub-loans financed by the Export Finance Fund could be&#13;
guaranteed for 80% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest up to 90 days,&#13;
provided a PFI's losses for guaranteed loans have not exceeded 15% of its guaranteed sub-loan&#13;
total. New loans made once this threshold has been reached (but losses less than 40%) could be&#13;
guaranteed with a coverage of 25%. No additional loans would be guaranteed if a PFI's loss rate&#13;
on guaranteed loans exceeds 40%. The PFI would pay the Apex a 0.15% premium on the&#13;
outstanding monthly balance guaranteed. This premium could be passed along to PFI borrowers.&#13;
The CGA would review select exporter data so as to mitigate the risk of fraudulent abuse and&#13;
review the eligibility of the PFI for such guarantee coverage. The CGA would issue a Guarantee&#13;
Certificate to the PFI for guaranteed sub-loans. The Export Credit Guarantee Fund would bear&#13;
the contingent risks owing to default from exporters' non-performance.&#13;
4.18        The Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantee Fund would be financed from&#13;
premiums, interest earned, and transfers from the Export Finance Guarantee Fund in a way&#13;
similar to that described for SMEs in para. 4.14 above. PFIs would effectively be exonerated&#13;
from repayment to the RBZ for 80% (or less) of the outstanding balance of defaulting sub-loans&#13;
entitled to compensation by the guarantee.&#13;
3. Institutional Development Component&#13;
4.19        As indicated in Annex C, an Institutional Development Component (Project Cost&#13;
US$2.2 million of which IDA would finance US$1.4 million) would provide support for the&#13;
strengthening of institutions key to improving enterprise development and export&#13;
competitiveness. This would include: (i) support for financial intermediaries in strengthening&#13;
their small business appraisal and monitoring systems and capacity; (ii) support of SEDCO in&#13;
sharpening its financial administration and strategic focus; (iii) support of the RBZ to improve&#13;
financial institution regulation; (iv) select support of the RBZ in its Apex Unit and credit&#13;
guarantee functions pertaining to this Project; (v) support of the Customs and Excise Department&#13;
in its automation and administration of duty-drawback and inward processing rebate provisions;&#13;
(vi) support to the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) Authority in the development of implementing&#13;
guidelines for the EPZ provisions; and (vii) support for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce&#13;
in its administration of economic policy. This component would also support the operation of&#13;
the Administrative Secretariat, with Government financing and co-financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4.20        Matching Grant Program for Financial Institutions. A Financial Institution&#13;
Matching Grant Program (Project Cost US$840,000 of which IDA would finance US$420. 000)&#13;
would be established to assist financial institutions in developing the capacity and systems&#13;
necessary for SME loan initiation, appraisal and monitoring. This scheme aims to mitigate some&#13;
of the costs incurred by financial intermediaries in undertaking or enhancing this new line of&#13;
activity. PFIs would have access to grant funds on a 50:50 basis to partially defray these additional&#13;
market entry costs in order to accelerate their movement in this area. The total expected IDA&#13;
support of US$420,000 would represent 14 matching grants of an average of US$30,000 over a&#13;
three-year period. Matching grants would be targeted at supporting the Small Business Units of&#13;
commercial banks. In order to receive such a grant, the financial institution must submit a&#13;
development program which should indicate precisely the type of expert advice or training&#13;
proposed. This could include the number of activities (workshops, on the job training, site visits,&#13;
courses attended) to be concluded, number of staff trained per activity, level of staff trained, type&#13;
of training conducted, sources of trainers, estimated cost per training event, estimated cost per&#13;
staff training event, and expected results. Matching grants could also be applied towards the&#13;
development of internal systems and controls of SME lending activity, such as the development&#13;
of a separate cost account and loan portfolio monitoring system for the Small Business Unit or&#13;
SME portfolio. It is likely that institutional development needs will be concentrated in the&#13;
following areas: (i) internal staff training; (ii) twinning/partnering with "best practice" financial&#13;
intermediaries abroad; (iii) specialized consultancies; and (iv) management information systems for&#13;
small business lending. The program would be managed by the Project Administrative Secretariat&#13;
(see Annex E), with support of a Technical Adviser and in consultation with IDA. Matching grant&#13;
approval should be by the Steering Team, at the recommendation of the Administrative&#13;
Secretariat. The submission to IDA of guidelines satisfactory to IDA for the matching grant&#13;
program would be a condition of disbursement of funds for this subcomponent.&#13;
4.21        Support of SEDCO in Strengthening its Financial Administration and Strategic&#13;
Focus (Project Cost US$1 70,000 financed by IDA). The Project would provide support for&#13;
SEDCO to strengthen its financial administration and strategic focus:  Select specialized&#13;
consultants would be supported under the Project, including a Financial Institution Management&#13;
Consultant, a Financial Specialist, and a Legal Specialist. Funding for computer upgrading&#13;
would also be provided. Key to-the effective use of funds under this subcomponent will be the&#13;
preparation by SEDCO management of a revised strategic plan, indicating the intended direction&#13;
for the institution and the means of achieving institutional strengthening. Submission of such a&#13;
plan, acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of support under this subcomponent.&#13;
4.22        Support of the RBZ to Improve Financial Institution Regulation and&#13;
Supervision (Project Cost US$200,000financed by IDA). The project would provide support to&#13;
the institutional strengthening of the RBZ in its expanded role of regulation and supervision of&#13;
financial institutions, by financing external consultants in providing hands-on guidance and&#13;
training in on-site inspection procedures and practices, off-site analysis, and in the development&#13;
of implementing regulations and circulars to complement the revised Banking Act.&#13;
4.23        Support of the RBZ in the Project Apex Unit and Credit Guarantee Functions&#13;
(Project Cost US$70,000 financed by IDA). The project would support the RBZ in developing&#13;
an Apex Unit and Credit Guarantee Agency (CGA) including the provision of consultant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
guidance in developing operations manuals for each unit, installing operating procedures for each&#13;
task, and training RBZ staff to carry out the Apex and CGA guarantee functions.&#13;
4.24        Strengthening Export Competitiveness - Support to Customs and Excise&#13;
(Project Cost US$300, 000 financed by IDA). The project would support measures by the&#13;
Customs and Excise Department to strengthen export competitiveness. Funds would be provided&#13;
to increase the efficiency of customs collection and, in particular, strengthen measures which&#13;
reduce anti-export biases against exporters, especially small export producers and indirect&#13;
exporters. The project would provide expert advice and computers to the Customs and Excise&#13;
Department in developing a modernized system of Input-Output Coefficient administration, in&#13;
the implementation of a Licensed Common Bonded Manufacturing Warehouse Scheme, and in&#13;
measures to improve the Inward Processing Rebate (IPR) and Duty Drawback provisions.&#13;
4.25        Support to the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) Authority (Project Cost&#13;
US$90, 000 financed by IDA). The project would support the recently-constituted EPZ Authority&#13;
and related Government agencies supporting the efficient regulation of export processing zones.&#13;
Support would be provided for the development of EPZ Customs Regime implementation&#13;
regulations and a study tour by Customs, Ministry of Finance and EPZ Authority staff to review&#13;
best practice EPZs in developing the implementation framework.&#13;
4.26        Support to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (Project Cost US$S100, 000&#13;
financed by IDA). The project would support the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in&#13;
improving its management of economic policy, and, in particular, in the coordination of bilateral&#13;
and multilateral initiatives. The aim of this support would be to provide training and computer&#13;
support to MOIC staff in fulfilling its new mandate. This support will prove vital, given the&#13;
increasingly active role the Ministry has taken on in the last two years in economic planning, and&#13;
in its role vis-ai-vis multilateral institutions. The project would provide funding for a series of&#13;
focused training sessions for MOIC staff on financial management, procurement and strategic&#13;
planning.&#13;
4.27        Support to Project Implementation Support (Project Cost US$460,000 financed&#13;
by the Government and cofinancing). The project would support the constitution and operation&#13;
of the Administrative Secretariat as well as the provision of a Technical Adviser who would&#13;
provide guidance in the management of the Institutional Development subcomponents, as well as&#13;
provide similar guidance in the operation of the ZMGS and MM Initiative (see Annexes B and&#13;
E).&#13;
E. Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
4.28        The proposed IDA credit of US$70 million equivalent would finance about 66%&#13;
of the total project cost. The cost estimates are based on the figures provided in Section D above&#13;
and in Annexes A-C. A contingency of US$1.3 million has been established in order to&#13;
accommodate unexpected total project costs for the Business Services and Institutional&#13;
Development components. This amount represents 7.9% of the cost for these components and&#13;
includes contingencies for both IDA and non-IDA funded portions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
4.29         As indicated in Table 3 below, private firms are expected to contribute US$18.1&#13;
million to SME and Export Finance sub-loans and as guarantee premiums. The Government&#13;
would backstop the sub-loan guarantees (US$10 million equivalent, depending upon the loss&#13;
record) and identify staff to manage the Administrative Secretariat. Operating costs would also&#13;
be supported by ZimTrade (US$0.3 million), which for these purposes has been included as&#13;
Government financing. Cofinancing from USAID and NORAD (estimated at US$1.8 million&#13;
equivalent) would contribute to the management of the SBAI Initiative as well as finance a&#13;
Technical Adviser. Private enterprises will participate in the financing of the project for a total&#13;
amount of US$23.7 million, including approximately 25-50% of matching grants and 20% of&#13;
sub-loans. Credit proceeds would be provided: (i) by the Government to PFIs as sub-loans via&#13;
the RBZ; (ii) as matching grants for the Business Services component and the Support to&#13;
Financial Institutions subcomponent; and (iii) as direct grants for the management of the&#13;
Business Services component and for other Institutional Development subcomponents.&#13;

F. Project Implementation&#13;
4.30         Project Implementation Plan. The framework for project implementation will be&#13;
a Project Implementation Plan which will be developed by the Government in association with&#13;
IDA. Such a plan will detail the precise objectives and operating parameters of each project&#13;
component, indicate the institutional and managerial arrangements, and indicate precise&#13;
monitoring indicators to evaluate outcomes. The plan should be developed under the leadership&#13;
of the Steering Team, with the execution by the Administrative Secretariat. Furnishing IDA such&#13;
a plan, satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of Credit Effectiveness.&#13;
4.31         Institutional Arrangements. The project would operate under the guidance of a&#13;
Steering Team (see Annex D) which would be comprised of the Permanent Secretary of the&#13;
Ministry of Industry and Commerce (chairman); the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance; the Head of Planning, National Economic Planning Commission; the Governor of the&#13;
Reserve Bank; the chief executives of the Zimbabwe Investment Center, ZimTrade, CZI, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
ZNCC and the Bankers Association; and a representative nominated by the indigenous business&#13;
community. The Steering Team would meet every two months, or more frequently as&#13;
circumstances dictate. Members of the Steering Team could designate officials to act on their&#13;
behalf, particularly given the likely possibility of the appointment of designated subcommittees&#13;
for select issues. A committee of the Steering Team would be designated to review eligibility&#13;
certification proposals for the participation of financial intermediaries. The functions of the&#13;
Steering Team would be as follows:&#13;
*  to monitor the overall direction of the Project and recommend modifications in design or&#13;
execution to IDA, as needed, in accordance with the parameters established under the Project;&#13;
*  to appoint staff and consultants under the project, as designated in the project documents;&#13;
*  to approve SBAI matching grants in excess of US$30,000;&#13;
*  to review business plans and support programs of any SBAI association, after such an&#13;
association has made expenditures in aggregate of US$35,000;&#13;
*  to confirm eligibility of an SBAI association for any subsequent US$35,000 tranche support;&#13;
*  to approve ZMGS matching grants above US$50,000 equivalent and all proposals for&#13;
matching grants referred to it by the ZMGS Management Team;&#13;
*  to review progress in the implementation of the individual project components, based upon&#13;
statistical information provided by the Administrative Secretariat or executing units for each&#13;
of the three components; and&#13;
*  to approve financial institutions for full or partial eligibility to participate under the project in&#13;
consultation with IDA, and in accordance with the eligibility criteria established and&#13;
evaluations conducted by external auditors. In the case of institutions found partially&#13;
eligible, agreeing on an action plan for the financial intermediary to remedy the deficiencies&#13;
noted.&#13;
4.32        An Administrative Secretariat, described in Annex E, would be responsible under&#13;
the project for carrying out the management functions of the Institutional Development&#13;
component, as well as would serve as an administrative arm of the Steering Team.&#13;
4.33        The Business Services component would be administered as follows: The SBAI&#13;
Initiative would be managed by an SBAI Administrator and supplemented by support from a&#13;
Technical Adviser.  This Administrator would have some autonomous decision-making&#13;
authority, subject to the limitations indicated in para. 4.31 above. The Administrator would be&#13;
required to be appointed prior to Credit Effectiveness. The ZimTrade Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
would be implemented by a ZMGS Management Team (two full-time ZimTrade staff), with the&#13;
support and oversight of the Steering Team. The Matchmaking Facility would be implemented&#13;
by a Matchmaking Management Contractor. The respective managers of each of these three&#13;
schemes would be required to furnish IDA with satisfactory operational guidelines for the SBAI,&#13;
ZMGS and the Matchmaking Facility, respectively, as a condition of Credit Effectiveness.&#13;
4.34        The Finance component would be managed through an Apex Unit and a Credit&#13;
Guarantee Agency (CGA) in the RBZ, in accordance with a Subsidiary Financing Agreement to&#13;
be entered into between the Government and the RBZ. The signing of such an agreement would&#13;
be a condition of Credit Effectiveness. The Apex would be responsible for: (i) intermediation of&#13;
SME and Export Finance funds acting as an agent on behalf of the Government, including the&#13;
facilitation of subproject commitments, subproject disbursements, and collection of repayments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
from PFIs; (ii) collecting and reviewing summary loan documents provided by PFIs; (iii)&#13;
overseeing the coordination of functions between the finance funds and guarantee facilities for&#13;
SMEs and exporters respectively; (iv) facilitating the transmission of eligibility evaluations from&#13;
interested financial intermediaries' auditors and the Steering Team; and (v) providing quarterly&#13;
summary statistical progress reports to the Steering Team and IDA. The functions the RBZ would&#13;
perform in administering the export and SME credit guarantee facilities would be to verify that the&#13;
exporter (via the PFI) has the required documentation, issue a guarantee certificate when approved,&#13;
and facilitate PFI account reconciliation in the event of default. All finance and guarantee functions&#13;
carried out by the Apex and CGA would be done on the account of the Government of Zimbabwe&#13;
and not the RBZ. The Apex would receive an annual fee of 0.5% on the average balance of sub-&#13;
loans it intermediates in order to cover the administrative costs associated with the above&#13;
responsibilities. The establishment by the RBZ of the Apex Unit, satisfactory to IDA and the&#13;
furnishing to IDA of satisfactory operating procedures would be a condition of Credit&#13;
Effectiveness. Compliance with the procedures and terms and conditions set out in the Project&#13;
Agreement would be a condition of disbursement of sub-loan funds.&#13;
4.35        Eligibility criteria for access of financial intermediaries to the Apex facility (see&#13;
Annex B). The aim of such eligibility criteria is to assure that: (i) retail institutions with access&#13;
to the facility are solvent and well-managed so as to assure their own sustainability; and (ii) such&#13;
institutions have the outreach to serve the SME and exporter target groups. The eligibility&#13;
criteria will use a stepladder approach, whereby select institutions will have limited eligibility&#13;
and then, depending upon their financial position and ability to lend, could increase their&#13;
exposure thereafter. The certification of at least one financial intermediary to participate in the&#13;
Project and the entering into a Participating Agreement with that financial intermediary would be&#13;
a condition of Credit Effectiveness.&#13;
4.36        The Institutional Development (ID) component would be administered by the&#13;
Administrative Secretariat as indicted in para. 4.32 above.&#13;
4.37        Procurement. Procurement of goods and works under the project would be&#13;
carried out in accordance with the Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
of January 1995, as summarized in Annex G. Procurement under sub-loans estimated to cost&#13;
US$60.0 million in aggregate would be in accordance with established local commercial&#13;
practices consistent with Section 3.12 of the Guidelines. PFIs will have to satisfy themselves&#13;
that goods and services are for investments approved by them and are reasonably priced, by&#13;
ensuring that sub-borrowers obtain the best prices by purchasing at the most advantageous&#13;
source. PFIs would be required to maintain records and documentation of procurement under&#13;
individual sub-loans for review by IDA during supervision.&#13;
4.38        As indicated in Annex A, under the Business Services and Institutional&#13;
Development components, all goods and services would be procured in accordance with&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. Procurement of goods (computers and equipment) under these&#13;
components would be made according to local shopping procedures, based on three quotations,&#13;
for any single contract totaling US$30,000 or less, according to Bank Procurement Guidelines of&#13;
January, 1995. Goods contracts costing more than US$30,000, but less than US$100,000, would&#13;
be procured in accordance with National Competitive Bidding procedures (NCB). Goods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
contracts in excess of US$ 100,000 would be procured in accordance with International&#13;
Competitive Bidding Procedures. The aggregate limit of the procurement of goods under the&#13;

Selection and contracting of consultants would be in accordance with the Guidelines, Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank and by World Bank as Executing Agency, August 1981. Standard&#13;
procurement/consultancy recruitment timetables and documents should also be used. Prior IDA&#13;
review would be required for consulting and other services for: (a) all contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of competitive selection and amendments to contracts with individuals with a final value of&#13;
US$50,000 or more and US$100,000 or more with firms; (b) all contracts awarded on the basis&#13;
of sole source; and (c) terms of reference for all contracts.&#13;
4.39          Disbursement.   Disbursement categories and  projected  disbursements  are&#13;
indicated in Tables 5 and 6 below. IDA will finance 100% of the IDA-allocated portion (US$70&#13;
million equivalent) as indicated in Annex H. Disbursement and withdrawal procedures are&#13;
detailed in the World Bank Disbursement Handbook (1992 edition). All disbursements are&#13;
subject to the conditions of the Development Credit Agreement and the procedures defined in the&#13;
Disbursement Letter. All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Credit account will be&#13;
fully documented, except for: (i) expenditures of contracts with an estimated value of&#13;
US$100,000 or less for goods, consulting firms and training; (ii) US$50,000 or less for&#13;
individual consultants; and (iii) all of the expenditures under the finance component which may&#13;
be claimed on the basis of certified statements of expenditure (SOE). Documentation supporting&#13;
expenditures claimed against SOE's would be retained by the Administrative Secretariat and the&#13;
Apex Unit, and will be available for review as requested by IDA supervision missions and&#13;
project auditors. To facilitate disbursements of eligible expenditures for goods and services, the&#13;
Government would open two Special Accounts (SA) in a commercial bank to cover local and&#13;
foreign currencies of IDA's share of eligible expenditures for the Finance, Business Services and&#13;
Institutional Development components. The authorized allocation of Special Account A for the&#13;
Finance component would be US$4.0 million, covering an estimated four months of eligible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
expenditures financed by IDA. The authorized allocation of Special Account B for the Business&#13;
Services and Institutional Development components would be US$500,000. Upon credit&#13;
effectiveness, 50% of the authorized allocations, amounting to US$2.0 million and US$250,000&#13;
respectively, would be deposited to the Special Accounts. The remaining balance will be made&#13;
available once total commitments under Special Account A have reached or exceeded SDR 8.0&#13;
million and under-Special Account B, SDR 1.0 million. Replenishment applications should be&#13;
submitted regularly, preferably monthly, after monthly bank statements are received and&#13;
reconciled by the implementing agencies, along with appropriate supporting documents for local&#13;
and foreign expenditures as required. To the extent possible, all of IDA's share of eligible&#13;
expenditures should be paid through the Special Accounts.&#13;

4.40           Audit and Reporting Requirements. All project accounts, the Special Accounts&#13;
Statement of Expenditures and financial accounts of PFIs would be audited at the end of each&#13;
fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Copies of such audit reports would be&#13;
forwarded to IDA within six months of the end of each reporting period. MOIC, the SBAI&#13;
Administrator, the MM Management Contractor, the ZMGS Management Team, the Apex and&#13;
the CGA would all be responsible for maintaining adequate records and a project information&#13;
system that would provide quarterly information on disbursements satisfactory to IDA. The&#13;
Apex would maintain full records on the Finance component and be responsible for coordinating&#13;
the audits of PFIs under its jurisdiction. MOIC would also be responsible for coordinating the&#13;
preparation of bi-annual progress reports prepared by each of the implementing agencies,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
indicating the progress in meeting the objectives of each component, according to the monitoring&#13;
indicators in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
4.41        Project Supervision.  This project will require significant IDA supervision&#13;
resources in order to support its multiple elements. Biannual supervision missions will work&#13;
closely with the Steering Team, Administrative Secretariat, the SBAI Administrator, the MM&#13;
Management Contractor, the ZMGS Management Team, the Apex and the CGA to jointly&#13;
supervise the project. Project supervision will be particularly extensive during the start-up phase&#13;
where fourteen staff weeks have been programmed for supervision during the last two months of&#13;
FY96 and 39 staff weeks in FY97. This amount is reduced in FY98 to 31 staff weeks and then&#13;
increases again to 38 staff weeks during FY99 when a mid-term review would be conducted.&#13;
Supervision will draw upon the support of an Local Specialist who will from the Resident&#13;
Mission on a part-time basis for a three-year period. Annex I provides a supervision plan.&#13;
4.42        Reporting Requirements. Quarterly progress reports under the project would be&#13;
sent to the Steering Team and to IDA from the Administrative Secretariat (Institutional&#13;
Development Component), RBZ (Credit Component), and the SBAI Administrator, ZMGS&#13;
Management Team and the MM Management Contractor (Business Services Component). In&#13;
addition, the Steering Team will be expected, with the assistance of the Administrative&#13;
Secretariat, to communicate periodically with IDA.&#13;
4.43        Mid-Term Review. A Mid-Term review is expected to be completed by June 30,&#13;
1999. This review will be carried out jointly with counterpart representatives indicated in para.&#13;
4.42 above. Recipients (private firms) would also be surveyed in the review to assess the success&#13;
of the project from a user's perspective. The purpose of the review would be to assess: (i)&#13;
whether the project is being implemented satisfactorily; (ii) how its design and functions can be&#13;
improved; (iii) whether and how it is achieving its objectives as discerned through monitorable&#13;
indicators; and (iv) what factors beyond the scope of the project have affected it in achieving its&#13;
objectives. Prior to the review, the Administrative Secretariat will be expected to prepare a&#13;
detailed report, covering areas to be greed upon with IDA, including an evaluation of progress in&#13;
project implementation. Reference documents will include Annex I, operating guidelines,&#13;
procedure manuals, audits and other Credit and Project documents.&#13;
4.44        Project Completion. This project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2002&#13;
and its closing date is December 31, 2002. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR), the&#13;
content and format of which would be agreed-upon with IDA, would be prepared within six&#13;
months after the closing date. IDA would prepare this ICR in close collaboration with the&#13;
Steering Team, the Administrative Secretariat, and the managers of each of the project units.&#13;
G. Environment&#13;
4.45        Environmental Aspects. This project is not expected to present any specific&#13;
environmental risks, and thus it has been given an environmental rating of "B".  An&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment Policy was developed and began to be implemented by the&#13;
Ministry of Environment and Tourism in 1994, although the means of implementation has been&#13;
weak. A National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) is currently under development. Sub-&#13;
projects financed under the project would be required to fully meet existing health, safety and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32-&#13;
environmental guidelines in effect at a national or a local level, and sub-borrowers would bear&#13;
the responsibility for failure to comply with such guidelines. Parallel to this, during project&#13;
implementation, the Government will examine how to develop an environmental review&#13;
procedure for sub-projects, consistent with the environmental review procedures applied to non-&#13;
IDA financed sub-projects. Neither an indigenous people's plan nor resettlement plan has been&#13;
developed.&#13;
H. Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
4.46        Project Benefits. This project would support a process to increase growth and&#13;
employment through increases in output led by exports, and broaden the scope of enterprise&#13;
development through expansion of small- and medium-sized indigenous businesses. In the wake&#13;
of significant policy reforms, the project aims to catalyze a process of accelerated growth by a&#13;
series of micro level interventions. Both aim to contribute to poverty alleviation in the medium-&#13;
term. This estimate is based on a methodology whereby the project is expected to accelerate an&#13;
increase in output by three years.&#13;
4.47        Many of the project benefits are difficult to measure in advance because the&#13;
project supports an acceleration of a process rather than a concrete outcome. Nevertheless, the&#13;
best estimate is that the project would generate a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$52 million at a&#13;
discount rate of 12% (see Annex J for details). First, the finance component is expected to&#13;
accelerate an increase in output by SMEs and emerging exporters by reducing the funding&#13;
constraint and the level of risk through the guarantee mechanism. This is expected to increase&#13;
output based on the level of working capital financing each year, reduced by the level of&#13;
resources expected to be diverted from other economic activities to achieve this result. Second,&#13;
matching grants for emerging exporters is expected, based on other empirical evaluations, to&#13;
yield an increase in output of these firms of at least ten times the amount of the combined&#13;
matching grant and the contribution of the enterprise, reduced by the level of resources expected&#13;
to be diverted from other economic activities to achieve this result. Third, albeit more indirectly,&#13;
matching grants for business associations is expected to increase output in accordance both with&#13;
the increase in membership of these associations, but, more importantly, in accordance with the&#13;
increased level of provision of service provided by these associations. Finally, measurement of&#13;
the economic benefits of institutional development support is the most difficult, because support&#13;
only yields provision of services to firms indirectly. Nonetheless, for the purpose of consistency,&#13;
it was assumed that this support would increase output, staggered 2 years after disbursements,&#13;
equal to the level of support.&#13;
4.48        Project Risks. The project's principal risks are: (i) the Government may fail to&#13;
contain the fiscal deficit, such that the impact of greater credit access and information&#13;
mechanisms is overshadowed and handicapped by macroeconomic instability and interest rates&#13;
which stifle emerging enterprises; (ii) certain components or subcomponents may prove more or&#13;
less difficult to administer, and thus turn out more or less successful in reaching their objectives;&#13;
(iii) the Government may not fully support the institution-building measures supported by the&#13;
credit because of insufficient commitment as shown in staffing or other resources, especially&#13;
counterpart funds; (iv) alternative below market funding could be provided by the Government&#13;
or other sources and undermine the Finance component; and (v) measures may prove slow to be&#13;
taken to further eliminate remaining anti-export biases inherent in the tariff and tax structure, so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
that exporters remain non-competitive in spite of measures supported under this project. These&#13;
actions could lead to weak results and threaten the sustainability of impact.&#13;
4.49        The most import measures mitigating against these risks are that the project has&#13;
been designed in a modular form such that component parts have been designed with some&#13;
parameters for evolution during implementation, and the redesign or the elimination of one&#13;
subcomponent need not affect the functioning of others. It is expected that some components or&#13;
subcomponents may not work out entirely as envisioned, but that such limitations need not&#13;
materially deter from the overall success of the project. Other features mitigating and adjusting&#13;
for these risks are: (i) the ongoing dialogue on the macroeconomic program among the Bank,&#13;
IMF and Government; (ii) the Finance Component will prove self-regulating to the extent that&#13;
commitments would slow if real interest rates remain high; (iii) in order to reduce the possibility&#13;
of alternative funding provided by other sources undercutting the Finance Component,&#13;
considerable discussions with multiple stakeholders has attempted to explain the poor results of&#13;
such subsidized interventions; (iv) a large number of stakeholders have been consulted and are&#13;
working as part of the project to support the measures which would make it a success; and (v)&#13;

ZIMBABWE&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
I. Intouction&#13;
1.            The objective of this Project is to support a stronger supply response by private sector&#13;
enterprises to policy reforms undertaken, including: (i) increasing the growth of export-based output; and&#13;
(ii) broadening participation in economic activity, in particular by indigenous firms. The Business&#13;
Services Component aims to "kickstart" these changes in Zimbabwe's private sector -- an increased&#13;
outward-orientation, enhanced international linkages, and a heightened awareness of the mutual benefits&#13;
of strengthened domestic networks which encompass large and small, established and emerging&#13;
enterprises. To achieve this, it is necessary in implementing this Component that:&#13;
*  the focal points for project implementation enjoy the confidence and support of the full range&#13;
of participants in Zimbabwe's private sector; and that&#13;
*  the organizational arrangements for implementation be temporary -- signaling that the goal is&#13;
not to create a permanent new public bureaucracy to "support" the private sector, but rather&#13;
to induce sustained changes in private actions and organizations.&#13;
2.             The Business Services Component comprises three elements -- the Subsector Business&#13;
Associations Initiative (SBAI), the ZimTrade Matching Grant Scheme (ZMGS), and the Foreign-&#13;
Domestic Matchmaking (MM) Initiative. As discussed below, each of these subcomponents would have&#13;
a manager or managers and would operate under the broad oversight of the EDP Steering Team. IDA&#13;
support for the Business Services Component would amount to US$7.4 million of a total cost of US$14.3&#13;
million as indicated in Table Al below.&#13;
II. Subsector Business Associations Initiative (SBAI)&#13;
3.             Background. International experience suggests that strong, service-oriented subsector&#13;
associations can play an important role in fostering productivity and competitiveness. As organizations&#13;
accountable to their members, they have a powerful incentive to ensure that the services they offer are&#13;
indeed those desired by their members. As collective organizations, they can provide services which&#13;
firms -- especially smaller firms -- might not be in a position to procure individually.I Further, they can&#13;
provide a valuable forum for networking among firms. The kinds of activities which a well-functioning&#13;
association active in a vibrant subsector might undertake could include:&#13;
+  preparation and provision of programs to improve the productivity and competitiveness of&#13;
members;&#13;
+  provision of information on trends in the subsector domestically and globally, and other&#13;
domestic issues of particular relevance to subsector members; and&#13;
+  a forum to facilitate networking and information-sharing among members.&#13;
Conceptually, there are two complementary rationales here. First, subsector associations as collective associations are well&#13;
positioned to provide "intra-industry public goods (services)". Second, they can provide services for which the fixed costs/scale economies&#13;
preclude provision by all but the largest firms.&#13;

2/    The amount of funding indicated would be the contribution by ZimTrade to the staffing and operating expenses of the&#13;
facility. They do not represent an additional fiscal responsibility by the Government.&#13;
4.             Objective. The objective of the SBAI program  is to help "kickstart" the emergence of&#13;
Zimbabwean associations capable of providing services to their members and acting as a forum for&#13;
networking among firms. These associations comprise groupings of firms engaged in similar activities,&#13;
typically manufacturing or services. In those cases, where for reasons of Zimbabwe's history, there&#13;
exists more than one association for a particular activity, the component will endeavor to foster&#13;
collaboration among these associations.&#13;
5.             Description. The SBAI Initiative has three parts:&#13;
*  The Initiative would provide development support to strengthen the capability of subsector&#13;
associations by providing financial support for the preparation of an initial business plan by&#13;
the association;&#13;
+  The Initiative would provide additional development support via a 50:50 matching grant&#13;
program, providing support for 12 months to cover the costs of a subsector association staff&#13;
person specialized in the concerns of the relevant subsector. This person could be full- or&#13;
part-time, and could be shared with one other subsector association; and&#13;
*  The Initiative would support subsector associations in the preparation of technical and&#13;
marketing programs (program matching grants) which aimed to improve the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -                                    Annex A&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
competitiveness and productivity of firms. The component would support the development&#13;
of such programs through the provision of matching funds, on a 25:75 cost-sharing basis (25&#13;
percent paid by participating firms, and 75 percent covered by the project) for eligible&#13;
programs. The intent is that, once the programs are designed, their delivery is contracted out&#13;
to private, domestic or foreign providers. On an as-needed basis, specialist assistance will be&#13;
made available to support associations in their preparation of an initial round of programs.&#13;
6.            Both the direct development support and program  matching grants are intended as&#13;
catalysts -- demonstrations to firms in the relevant subsectors, and to the private sector more broadly, of&#13;
the benefits of strong, productivity-oriented subsector associations. The expectation is that, having once&#13;
experienced the benefits to be derived from such associations, firms will then be willing to continue&#13;
using them, unsupported by SBAI grants. Consequently, the scheme is designed to be temporary, to&#13;
operate only for a single, three-year period.&#13;
7.            The SBAI Grant Support is estimated at US$1.25 million equivalent, which is derived&#13;
from estimates of the number of participants and average size for each type of support: This support is&#13;
allocated as follows:&#13;
v  Development Support. It is especially difficult to predict the demand for development&#13;
support -- both the number of associations that might be interested, and the balance between&#13;
full-time and part-time demand per association. An amount of US$10,000 would be&#13;
allocated per association for the preparation of a business plan, with 15 subsector&#13;
associations estimated to participate in this subcomponent, making for a total estimated cost&#13;
of US$150,000. Development support for a subsector association staffperson is estimated to&#13;
require over a three-year period, the equivalent of six full-time specialists for 12 months, at&#13;
an approximate cost of US$200,000.&#13;
*  Program  Matching Grants.  For program  matching grant support, a grant ceiling of&#13;
US$100,000 over the period would be set per subsector/association. A reasonable target is&#13;
that over a three-year period, 75:25 matching grant support for programs will be provided to&#13;
30 existing subsector associations, at an average cost of US$30,000 each. Total IDA support&#13;
would thus amount to US$900,000.&#13;
8.            Oversight and  Management.   The SBAI will be implemented by an SBAI&#13;
Administrator, supported as needed by specialist management contracting services, and by a Technical&#13;
Adviser to the Project. The SBAI Administrator will have full responsibility for managing the SBAI&#13;
initiative. This Administrator will be funded by USAID, and will operate as a member of the USAID&#13;
Zimbabwe Enterprise Project team. As needed, the Administrator will be supported by a Technical&#13;
Adviser for the Project. To support SBAI management, IDA will make available US$150,000 to contract&#13;
specialist management contracting services, to work with subsector associations in the preparation of&#13;
relevant technical and marketing programs. These funds could be disbursed as agreed by the SBAI&#13;
Administrator and a Technical Adviser. All uses of these funds should be reported to the Steering Team.&#13;
9.            Oversight of the SBAI. Oversight of the SBAI will be exercised by the Steering Team&#13;
of the Project. In addition, as part of the normal operation of the SBAI, its staff will be responsible for&#13;
ongoing liaison with the full range of business associations in Zimbabwe -- including CZI, ZNCC, IBDC&#13;
and ZABO. One possibility to which the Steering Team and the SBAI Administrator might give serious&#13;
consideration (but not explicitly required in the project) is having an explicit review of the SBAI&#13;
program every three months with an informal liaison committee (comprising representatives of&#13;
Zimbabwe's business association community) established for that purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 38 -                                    AnnexA&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
10.           Approval Procedures.  Matching grants for program  support of under US$30,000&#13;
would be able to be approved jointly by the SBAI Administrator and a Technical Adviser. Grants of&#13;
program support in excess of that amount will require the approval of the Steering Team or its designated&#13;
representatives.  Once any association has received a cumulative total of support amounting to&#13;
US$35,000 (including support for the preparation of a business plan and development support for staff),&#13;
the program of support and the association's business plan must be reviewed by the Steering Team or its&#13;
designated representative prior to any further provision of support. A second review will be required&#13;
once the cumulative total amount of support reaches US$70,000.&#13;
11.           Eligibility of Associations and Programs. One crucial criterion for eligibility for these&#13;
funds is that participating subsector associations be well-placed to mount focused programs of technical&#13;
and marketing support for their members (see below). This criterion suggests that a broad range of&#13;
business groupings -- though not the full universe -- would be eligible. Subsector associations organized&#13;
around members engaged in activities such as manufacturing, agro-processing, tourism/hostelry would&#13;
be well-positioned to mount such focused programs -- and hence would straightforwardly qualify to&#13;
access start-up support. Local chambers of commerce, whose members are drawn from a wide variety of&#13;
activities, would not be eligible.&#13;
12.           Requirements of participating associations are:&#13;
*  that the putative association have a critical mass of members -- 10;&#13;
* that the governing authority of the association be democratically elected by the membership;&#13;
*  that members pay dues at an agreed rate (how this rate will change once the initial start-up&#13;
support for overhead costs has been drawn down should be specified from the start); and&#13;
*  that the association formally commit itself to work cooperatively on the provision of&#13;
business services and information with any other associations that might operate (or emerge)&#13;
in a similar sphere of business activity.&#13;
13.           The last criterion is critical to the nurturance of a positive, business environment in&#13;
which information flows freely. Consequently, it would be a precondition for any business organization&#13;
to gain access to project resources (including matching grants for programs) -- including national&#13;
associations, and local, multi-sectoral chambers of business.&#13;
14.           Eligibility for Program Matching Grant Funds. For an association to be eligible for&#13;
matching grant funds for programs which it might mount, it will need to meet all the eligibility criteria&#13;
delineated above. It will also need to develop a strategic business plan which outlines how it plans to&#13;
evolve in the subsequent few years. As described above, the SBAI initiative will provide up to&#13;
US$10,000 to support the costs of developing this plan. Plans prepared independently should be&#13;
discussed with the SBAI Administrator prior to the receipt of program support. The SBAI Administrator&#13;
will require the approval of the Steering Team not to provide any support should the plan be judged&#13;
unsatisfactory, and fail to be modified. In addition, associations that seek program matching grant funds&#13;
will need to agree to the following:&#13;
*  to permit non-members to participate in programs funded with matching grants;&#13;
*  to actively market these programs to non-members; and&#13;
*  (if there are any other subsector associations with members drawn from similar subsector&#13;
activities) to offer to provide the programs in co-operation with the parallel association or, if&#13;
that association is unwilling to co-operate, to allow the association's members to participate.&#13;
Additionally, all applications for program support will need to be accompanied by a statement of how the&#13;
program supported by the SBAI will benefit smaller-scale firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -                                    AnnexA&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
15.           The above does not preclude associations from having programs for members only; these&#13;
could not, however, be supported with matching grant funds. Note also that the detailed eligibility&#13;
criteria outlined above focus on the organization of subsector associations, and their relations with others&#13;
-- not the detailed content of the programs to be offered. In the initial stage of the component, it is&#13;
expected that subsector associations will develop programs jointly with the management team. But once&#13;
the association develops the capability to design programs in-house, so long as the program is focused on&#13;
specialized, subsector initiatives to enhance productivity (see below), no effort should be made to&#13;
second-guess the association's programs with independent technical evaluations.&#13;
16.           Types of Eligible Programs. The general principle is that eligible programs are those&#13;
that aid the efforts of firms to improve productivity and competitiveness. Eligible programs should not&#13;
be general purpose in character (i.e. they should not focus on general management and financing issues&#13;
that are generic to firms across multiple activities). Rather, they should be tailored to the specific&#13;
requirements of firms in particular activities.&#13;
17.           As noted above, applications for SBAI program funds will need to include a statement&#13;
which details how the program will benefit smaller-scale firms. Programs which benefit only large firms&#13;
will not be eligible for SBAI support. In principle, all firms in the relevant activity could participate in&#13;
supported programs. In practice, large firms are likely to be less dependent on collective mechanisms&#13;
than their smaller counterparts to gain access to productivity-enhancing resources. (The matching grant&#13;
component for individual firms, possibly operating through ZimTrade and described elsewhere, is&#13;
intended to help kickstart such efforts.) Further, the Project is targeted for a tier of firms larger than&#13;
informal, microenterprises. It follows that programs would usefully be designed to reach the "middle-&#13;
tier" of small-to-medium terms.&#13;
18.           One objective of subsector associations is as a mechanism to elicit demand from small-&#13;
to-medium firms as to what kinds of services they find useful. So, subject to the general principles&#13;
delineated above, it would be contrary to that objective for this component to prescribe what programs&#13;
are eligible.&#13;
19.           In the initial phase of development, subsector associations may not yet be in a position to&#13;
elicit demand.  So nascent associations might usefully work with the management team  on the&#13;
development of an initial menu of offerings. (The requirement that participating firms cover 25 percent&#13;
of costs would provide a useful "reality check" as to what is demanded, even at the initial stage.)&#13;
Broadly speaking, "specialized, tailored programs" aim to enhance a Technical and marketing&#13;
capabilities of firms:&#13;
*  Technical programs aim  to enhance the productivity with which firms pursue their&#13;
specialized business activities. Such programs likely include initiatives to: (i) improve&#13;
organization of the workplace; (ii) upgrade the quality of equipment; (iii) strengthen design&#13;
capability; plus (iv) other initiatives to enhance product quality. These might also include&#13;
targeted, short-duration initiatives to enhance the skills of specific categories of workers.&#13;
*  Marketing programs aim to enhance the ability of firms to pursue initiatives to penetrate new&#13;
domestic or export markets. The SBAI will support programs to promote the dissemination&#13;
of subsector-specific, but not firm-specific, information. Firm-specific information will be&#13;
disseminated through the ZimTrade Matching Grant Scheme.  Among the range of&#13;
domestically-oriented programs are those that seek to promote subcontracting between large&#13;
and small firms. It is anticipated that such programs could be funded through the linkage&#13;
programs developed by USAID and NORAD. Programs focusing on export markets could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Business Services Component&#13;
initially fruitfully be developed in collaboration with ZimTrade -- although it is important&#13;
that from the first subsector associations have the autonomy to draw on export marketing&#13;
services from sources other than ZimTrade.&#13;
20.          Based on experience elsewhere, programs in areas such as the above would often be&#13;
mounted in the form of short "courses" (ranging from a two-hour presentation to a two day program).&#13;
An alternative model might be for the subsector association to invite a consultant for a visit of, say, two&#13;
weeks duration, during which time the consultant might provide individually-tailored advice to a number&#13;
of interested firns.&#13;
21.          The SBAI Administrator. The SBAI Administrator will be located in the offices of the&#13;
USAID Zimbabwe Enterprise Development (ZED) Project, and will be fully financed by USAID (as its&#13;
cofinancing contribution to this project). The tasks of the Administrator will include the following:&#13;
*  promoting the SBAI -- and the advantages of networks of co-operation among firms -- to&#13;
subsector associations and business groupings more broadly;&#13;
*  supporting subsector associations in the preparation of business plans which outline the&#13;
strategic direction of the association (this activity may be conducted jointly with private&#13;
consultants recruited with funds made available through the SBAI for that purpose);&#13;
*  working together with subsector associations, and other external advisers as necessary, to&#13;
develop technical and marketing programs for the subsector to be supported by SBAI&#13;
matching grants, including identification of private providers for the programs;&#13;
*  ensuring that programs supported by the SBAI are responsive to the needs of smaller and&#13;
newer firms, as well as established, large companies;&#13;
*  approving, jointly with a Technical Adviser, all matching grants of program support to&#13;
subsector associations for amounts below US$30,000, and reporting on these approvals to&#13;
the EDP Steering Team;&#13;
i preparing (jointly with a Technical Adviser) recommendations to the Steering Team on&#13;
whether to support applications for individual SBAI program grants in excess of US$30,000;&#13;
*  when subsector associations reach the cumulative US$35,000 and US$70,000 benchmarks of&#13;
SBAI support, preparing (jointly with the subsector association) a review of progress for the&#13;
Steering Team, including a recommendation on whether support for that association should&#13;
continue; and&#13;
*  approving, jointly with a Technical Adviser, matching grant support for the appointment of a&#13;
full- or part-time staffperson by an individual subsector association.&#13;
III. ZimTrade Matching Grant Scheme&#13;
A. Objectives and Functions&#13;
22.          Background. The Economic and Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP) has radically&#13;
altered the "rules of the game" for Zimbabwe's private sector. Prior to ESAP, Zimbabwe's private sector&#13;
operated on the presumption of stable domestic markets, and with very limited innovation. In a&#13;
liberalized environment, the private sector will need to become more dynamic and more outward-&#13;
oriented -- looking for opportunities in international markets, scanning globally for technological and&#13;
other innovations which it can apply at home, and incorporating high quality imported inputs into its&#13;
production process.&#13;
23.          Objectives. The ZimTrade Matching Grant Scheme (ZMGS) is intended to support the&#13;
process of restructuring in two ways:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -                                   Annex A&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
*  ZMGS will stimulate the use of foreign and domestic support services and travel by private&#13;
firms through the provision of 50:50 cost-sharing grants. Experience elsewhere indicates&#13;
that these activities can contribute strongly to speeding firm-level response.  Support&#13;
services quickly introduce into firms the skills, know-how, information and contacts that will&#13;
be needed, in order either to defend against import competition, or to expand exports. Travel&#13;
by key personnel helps to build realism about how best the firm can find its niche in an&#13;
international marketplace. It establishes contacts both with export outlets and with sources&#13;
of imported inputs that could help build competitiveness.&#13;
*  Zimbabwean firms however, appear to seriously undervalue what can be gained during firm-&#13;
level adjustment from the use of support services and travel. Because they undervalue the&#13;
benefits they expect from services and travel abroad, these firms perceive both as&#13;
"expensive," and therefore of low interest. As a way of encouraging firms to explore what&#13;
might be the benefits of these external sources of information and know-how, the ZMGS will&#13;
provide, on the basis of a plan prepared by the firm, 50-50 cost-sharing grants towards the&#13;
costs of buying in outside support services and travel. Based on international experience, it&#13;
is expected that about 80 percent of grant support will go towards technical and productivity&#13;
adjustments within the factory, and about 20 percent will support efforts at marketing&#13;
directly.&#13;
*  ZMGS will support the process of restructuring in a "hands-on" way with firms to prepare&#13;
firm-level plans aimed at enhancing competitiveness -- involving support services and travel,&#13;
and to be supported by the ZMGS. To be sure, Zimbabwean firms are far better placed than&#13;
outsiders to know what are the opportunities and constraints in the domestic markets in&#13;
which they operate; and they know better than outsiders how to respond to the specific&#13;
challenges of efficient production posed by the Zimbabwean setting. However, long years of&#13;
isolation and limited competition are likely to have left substantial knowledge gaps as to&#13;
global trends in their specific markets, in technological innovation, and in innovations in&#13;
work organization and planning. These gaps make it difficult for firms to alone prepare&#13;
plans for effectively drawing on external sources of information and know-how.&#13;
24.           The Matching Grant scheme would seek to add to, strengthen, and build upon a&#13;
foundation of the current Export Promotion for Support Services (EPSS), currently offered by ZimTrade.&#13;
The Scheme represents a reformulation of the existing scheme, as well as an upgrading and extension of&#13;
the program.&#13;
25.           The ZMGS Management Team will have a full-time Zimbabwean staff, plus access to&#13;
specialist private management contracting resources, with the global knowledge and private sector&#13;
experience that can help fill the knowledge gaps in the private sector. It will proactively promote the&#13;
scheme to owners and senior managers of private firms, concentrating on those assessed as having the&#13;
highest potential for building international competitiveness. The objective of this promotional effort will&#13;
be to encourage firms to make use of the scheme, to obtain agreement on a formal plan which could be&#13;
supported by the scheme, and on the initial set of actions by the firm for implementing that plan.&#13;
26.           Both the matching grant cost-sharing and the proactive, hands-on initiatives are intended&#13;
as catalysts -- demonstrations to participating firms, and to the private sector more broadly, of the&#13;
benefits of actively seeking out external sources of information and know-how. The expectation is that,&#13;
having once experienced the benefits to be derived from such activities, firms will then be willing to&#13;
continue using them, unsupported by ZMGS grants. Consequently, the scheme is deliberately designed&#13;
to be temporary, to operate only for a single, three-year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Business Services Component&#13;
B. Organization of ZMGS&#13;
27.           Demand Size of the Matching Grant Fund. Demand for matching grant schemes&#13;
along the above lines is difficult to predict accurately in advance, especially since comprehensive&#13;
statistics as to the number and size of Zimbabwean firms are not publicly available. As a starting point,&#13;
ZimTrade has a register of about 1,000 potential exporting firms.' Increasing this number by 50 percent&#13;
to account for excluded firms and new entrants yields a total of 1,500 firms. International experience&#13;
suggests that if the ZMGS can persuade 10-15 percent of these firms to participate in the scheme, it&#13;
could be counted a success. Thus a reasonable goal would be to have 200 participants over the scheme's&#13;
three-year lifespan.&#13;
28.           Since the benefits to Zimbabwe would be substantial if large firms also made serious&#13;
efforts at restructuring, it is not intended to limit participation in the scheme only to small and medium&#13;
enterprises. The costs of implementing a restructuring plan by a large firm can be substantial. To&#13;
provide an attractive incentive for large firms to participate, while ensuring that grant funds are not&#13;
disproportionately directed towards very few firms, a cap of US$100,000 of grant support will be set per&#13;
firm. In the event that a substantial number of large grants are approved early in the program, this&#13;
ceiling -- and other parameters of the component -- can be reviewed by the Steering Team in association&#13;
with IDA.&#13;
29.           In practice few, if any, matching grants are likely to reach this US$100,000 ceiling&#13;
(which would support a US$200,000 program -- with US$100,000 covered by the participating firm).&#13;
ZimTrade data identifies only 109 firms with 500 or more employees, and only 72 with turnover above&#13;
US$12.3 million (Zim$100 million). Moreover, as a guideline, a large proportion of applications for the&#13;
existing EPSS (on which more below) were for substantially less than the US$10,000 ceiling. Based on&#13;
these data and international experience, a reasonable expectation is that the average grant across the&#13;
estimated 200 participants will be for US$15,000 -- implying a total matching grant fund of US$3&#13;
million.&#13;
30.           Structure and Budget of the ZMGS Management Team. Corresponding to the work-&#13;
load implied by the above data, the ZMGS would have two full-time Zimbabwean staff, both formally&#13;
employees of ZimTrade, including one senior person designated as Team Leader. The two designated&#13;
ZimTrade staffers (plus other ZimTrade personnel) would be provided with specialized training to enable&#13;
them to work effectively as technical and organizational (as well as marketing) consultants to the private&#13;
sector -- to the point of being able to work effectively in the design of programs which qualify for ZMGS&#13;
support. Ordinarily, no firm should receive more than 2-3 days of free support to prepare its program.&#13;
The ZimTrade staffers could be supported by an external management contract firm who would provide&#13;
specialists to make multiple short-term visits in support of the ZMGS outreach efforts. The management&#13;
contract team should have an extensive track record of working intensively on enhancing the&#13;
competitiveness and productivity of firms, and should have intimate knowledge of the range of business&#13;
support services available in the international marketplace.&#13;
31.           IDA resources will support the ZMGS Management Team  in the following ways:&#13;
US$600,000 has been allocated under the Project for the specialist management contracting firm. At the&#13;
soonest opportunity, the EDP Steering Team (working together with ZimTrade) should initiate the&#13;
bidding process to recruit these services for an initial period. US$150,000 has been allocated to support&#13;
2      The ZimTrade number is substantially in excess of the 518 manufacturing firms which were registered members of CZI in 1993.&#13;
Even so, the CZI firms together still accounted for as much as 86 percent of the official 1993 figure for manufacturing employment reported by&#13;
the Central Statistical Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-                                     Ann-A&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
a training initiative to develop the relevant staff skills within ZimTrade. Recurrent costs of the initiative&#13;
(salaries of the two ZimTrade staffers, plus office overheads) will be met by ZimTrade. The Project has&#13;
allocated a further US$15,000 to cover "extraordinary" expenses associated with the initial year of the&#13;
program's launch (e.g. outreach expenses for program launch; office equipment). Thus, total IDA&#13;
support for the ZMGS, including the Matching Grant Fund, is estimated to be US$3,765,000.&#13;
32.           Oversight of ZMGS. Although ZMGS will operate as part of ZimTrade, formally&#13;
responsibility for oversight will vest with the Steering Team of the EDP or its designated representative.&#13;
As described earlier, the approach to determining which programs qualify for support will be one of&#13;
"quality management" through providing inputs up-front, rather than "quality control" through technical&#13;
evaluation of plans. Two options for "quality management" will be available to firms. In the first&#13;
option, firms will have the right to submit programs prepared independently; however, to ensure that the&#13;
proposed initiatives are presented in good faith, and are broadly consistent with the market positioning of&#13;
the firm, no plan will be supported without a visit to the firm by a ZMGS staffperson. In the second&#13;
option, program  will he prepared by the firm with the active support of the ZMGS management team&#13;
(supplemented :- specialist management contracting services). In keeping with the spirit of "quality&#13;
management" r atiler than "quality control, the role of the Steering Team should be largely an arms-length&#13;
one, with a primary focus on the overall parameters of the program. Hence, only proposals which&#13;
involve grants in excess of US$50,000 would be brought to the Steering Team for approval.&#13;
33.           Approvals of proposals under US$50,000 would be the internal responsibility of the&#13;
ZMGS management team, and hence ZimTrade. All such proposals would require the joint approval of&#13;
the ZMGS team leader plus a Technical Adviser, with proposals in excess of US$30,000 requiring, in&#13;
addition, the approval of ZimTrade's chief executive or his or her designated representative.&#13;
34.           All approvals by the ZMGS Management Team would be considered by the next&#13;
meeting of the Steering Team ex-post, in order for the committee to give guidance on future approvals&#13;
policy, where needed. The Steering Team could only revoke an approval already granted by the ZMGS&#13;
management team in the event that fraudulent information was determined to have been provided within&#13;
an application.&#13;
35.           Relation To Other ZimTrade Activities. It is unusual that matching grant schemes are&#13;
located within organizations which also directly provide services to firms similar to those supported by&#13;
the scheme. For this reason, it is important to be explicit about the relationship between ZimTrade's&#13;
activities, and the support to be provided by the ZMGS.&#13;
36.           A serious potential conflict of interest could emerge if the ZMGS were to pay ZimTrade&#13;
for services which it provided to firms; in such a situation, there could be a strong incentive for&#13;
ZimTrade staff on the ZMGS to steer firms towards ZimTrade's services. As a way of avoiding this risk,&#13;
it will be stipulated (with the concurrence of ZimTrade's senior management) that no recipient can&#13;
obtain a grant for the usage of any services provided by ZimTrade3.&#13;
37.           More generally, an important part of ZimTrade's role is a catalytic one -- ZimTrade's&#13;
ability to do its job would be enhanced by a "thickening" of the marketplace for private consulting&#13;
services, and by an enhancement in the capabilities of specialized subsector business associations. In the&#13;
view of the management of ZimTrade, the ZMGS will thus be an important addition to the range of tools&#13;
at their disposal.&#13;
3      Note that the precedent for this stipulation already is present in a similar stipulation in the present EU funded matching grant&#13;
scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -                                   4nnexA&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
38.           There are, however, two ZimTrade programs whose relation to the ZMGS needs explicit&#13;
mention. First, as noted, there already exists a European Union (EU)-funded matching grant program --&#13;
the Export Promotion Support Scheme. The principles under which the scheme operates -- a low ceiling&#13;
of grant support, a passive approach to the receipt of proposals, no formal requirement of factory visits to&#13;
applicants, and a technical evaluation of each proposal by a large committee -- are radically at variance&#13;
with those presented here, and the EU and ZimTrade have already taken the initiative in exploring how&#13;
they might be adapted. It would be desirable to integrate the two programs, as it is difficult to see how&#13;
both schemes could operate simultaneously.&#13;
39.           Second, ZimTrade offers a New Exporters Development Program, which provides free&#13;
training and "hand-holding" to new, potential exporters to the point that they enter export markets. In&#13;
principle, such a scheme conflicts with the "develop a plan and then contract for services" approach of&#13;
the ZMGS. In practice, the Program is a signal of ZimTrade's commitment that its services are inclusive&#13;
-- geared to emerging, predominantly indigenous, enterprises as well as established firms.  This&#13;
commitment is important for the ZMGS as well, and it is to be hoped that, as they graduate, enterprises&#13;
in the New Exporters Program will increasingly require services on a scale and sophistication that can&#13;
most effectively be contracted from private providers with the support of the ZMGS.&#13;
C. Qualifying Criteria for Grant Support&#13;
40.           Qualifying Firms. The ZMGS would be open to all private firms in all manufacturing,&#13;
agro-processing and exportable service sectors. The grant scheme would operate essentially on a "first-&#13;
come, first-served" basis. A matching grant would be given provided: (i) the applicant demonstrates a&#13;
credible plan for building international competitiveness; (ii) the applicant is willing to make the 50&#13;
percent contribution to costs; (iii) the scheme contains adequate defenses against abuse; and (iv) the&#13;
activity is shown to contribute to the firm's plan. Grant support for expenditures would be on a&#13;
reimbursement basis. That is to say that recipient firms would be expected initially to fund the costs of&#13;
supported activities, later claiming back 50 percent reimbursement.&#13;
41.           As summarized earlier, members of the ZMGS management team  would seek to&#13;
establish a close working relationship with each grant-recipient firm and, as requested, to work with&#13;
them in the preparation of their plan to be funded 50:50 by the ZMGS. Proposals prepared jointly with&#13;
the team would be "automatically" supported, following the procedures outlined earlier. While firms&#13;
would retain the right to prepare their own programs, no program would be supported without a prior&#13;
visit to the firm by a member of the management team. Firms which felt that the management team was&#13;
being unreasonable in its "suggestions" would have the right to appeal to the Steering Team.&#13;
42.          In addition to the above, the scheme would guard against misuse by its insistence on a 50&#13;
percent contribution by the firm itself. Also, the scheme would insist on specifying deliverable outputs,&#13;
allowing for checking that the money is indeed being used for the purpose agreed. Finally, close&#13;
working relationships with each grant-recipient firm would allow the management team to follow up on&#13;
any unusual aspects causing concern.&#13;
43.           Qualifying Firm-Level Programs. To qualify for ZMGS grant support, firm-level&#13;
programs must be aimed at enhancing international competitiveness. The program should be driven by a&#13;
written statement, committing the firm to its execution. This statement should demonstrate that the firm&#13;
has given serious consideration to the planning issues involved, such as:&#13;
* identification of the sequence of steps required within the plan, in order to achieve the&#13;
improvement in international competitiveness desired;&#13;
* resources required for each step within the plan, both internal and externally-sourced;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Business Services Component&#13;
+ best estimates of the likely benefits to the firm to be achieved by the plan, plus a comparison&#13;
of these with the likely costs and risks to the firm; and&#13;
* an approximate timed action plan.&#13;
44.           A qualifying program will seek to take a firm from its present state of international&#13;
competitiveness to some future planned-for state where this has been substantially enhanced. In the&#13;
Zimbabwean context, this is virtually certain to involve the firm having to look beyond the small&#13;
domestic market. The program may include several steps, and several separate usages of support&#13;
services and travel. The program should, however, only seek to deal with competitiveness issues clearly&#13;
definable in the firm's present state. Typically, a program to build international competitiveness might&#13;
take a firm through three stages:&#13;
*  investigation of the target market, be it domestic or foreign, usually starting with desk&#13;
research or limited phone research, followed then by more intensive field interviewing,&#13;
either carried out by the firm's staff or by an outside service supplier;&#13;
*  supply package adaptation, on the basis of information collected from the market, in order to&#13;
bring what is being supplied presently into line with customer preferences, and to meet&#13;
global competition.  This could be, for instance, through changes in product design,&#13;
rationalizing production to reduce costs, or through improved quality assurance, and&#13;
*  active selling, with the adaptation completed, of the improved supply package.&#13;
Programs can -- and often should -- be broken down into distinctive sub-plans. As noted, the lifetime&#13;
grant support for the program to an individual firm is US$100,000. However, to encourage firms to&#13;
develop a medium-term strategy for upgrading competitiveness from the start -- and to signal that the&#13;
purpose of the subcomponent is to demonstrate the value of external support, not provide an ongoing&#13;
subsidy -- limits will be placed on the number of distinctive programs which a firm can submit. In&#13;
particular, grant funds will be provided to a firm for a maximum of three programs. Moreover, once a&#13;
qualifying program supported by a grant in excess of US$50,000 had been completed, the firm concerned&#13;
would thereafter receive no further grant support from the ZMGS.&#13;
45.           Qualifying Activities. Any use of external support services, or travel, demonstrably&#13;
contributing to any step within a qualifying firm-level plan, would be supported. The following&#13;
examples of what would normally qualify and what would not are provided for further guidance:&#13;
*  In-factory consultancy and short-term contract management services, say up to six months in&#13;
duration per introduced expert, would normally qualify, but new permanent staff&#13;
appointments would not;&#13;
*  Consultancy or short-term contract management assistance directed specifically at improving&#13;
labor productivity or yields on raw materials would normally qualify;&#13;
* Assistance in improving in-house capabilities in design-related techniques such as pattern-&#13;
making, prototyping, grading, sizing, counter-sampling, etc., would normally qualify.&#13;
Buying in a set of designs for one season only, with no longer-term enhancements aimed for,&#13;
would normally not qualify;&#13;
* The expenses of exposure tours for factory personnel, to view alternative techniques and&#13;
technologies in factories elsewhere would normally qualify; and&#13;
*  Market exploration  tours by marketing  personnel to  explore new  export market&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
46.           For each qualifying activity for which grant support was being sought, the firm&#13;
concerned would be expected to define at least one "measurable output", the sight of which would allow&#13;
the administrators of the scheme to verify that the activity had indeed taken place as described.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -                                    AnnexA&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
Depending on the circumstance, a defined deliverable might consist, for instance, of a detailed&#13;
engineering drawing, or a prototype, incorporating quality improvements; a set of standard times&#13;
developed for a production process, against which productivity could be assessed; or an externally-&#13;
commissioned market report. Administrators would assist client firms in defining suitable outputs that&#13;
will allow them to verify activities, but which are in any case beneficial to the firm, rather than produced&#13;
merely for the benefit of the scheme.&#13;
47.           Qualifying Expenditures. Expenditures on service fees, plus expenditures on travel and&#13;
incidental expenses charged at cost, incurred wholly and exclusively on a qualifying activity, would be&#13;
eligible for 50 percent grant support. Salaries for staff employed by the supported firm would not be&#13;
eligible, nor would recurrent costs such as royalty fees. No expenditures on hardware could be&#13;
supported, even where equipment or instrumentation purchases formed an important part of a firm-level&#13;
plan. Expenditures on services provided by the firm undertaking the ZMGS management contract or&#13;
associated firms (including, as discussed, ZimTrade), would not qualify for support.&#13;
48.           The choice of service supplier would be made by the recipient firn, and would not be&#13;
restricted to suppliers on any central register, or in any other way. However, the administrators of the&#13;
scheme would seek to satisfy themselves as to the supplier's competence for the task intended, and that&#13;
there was a genuine arms-length commercial relationship between supplier and user. The administrators&#13;
of the scheme would also seek to satisfy themselves that fee rates being charged for services were&#13;
broadly in line with market realities, particularly in cases where service suppliers were not previously&#13;
known to the administrators. In general, firms procuring services will be encouraged to obtain bids from&#13;
at least three technically qualified contenders. Such bids could be required at the discretion of the&#13;
administrators -- and will automatically be required for services costing in excess of US$10,000.&#13;
D. Terms of Reference for ZMGS Management&#13;
49.           Full-time Staff from ZimTrade. The responsibilities of the ZMGS Team Leader and a&#13;
second staff person (both seconded from ZimTrade) will comprise the following:&#13;
*  promoting the ZMGS to small, medium and large firms (particular emphasis should be&#13;
placed on promoting the scheme to two groups of firms -- high potential indigenous firms;&#13;
and established, larger firms assessed as having the highest potential for international&#13;
competitiveness);&#13;
*  visiting the facilities of all applicants for matching grant support;&#13;
+  working jointly with firms who so desire on the preparation of a qualifying plan for matching&#13;
grant support (with the assistance of the specialist management contracting team, as&#13;
necessary);&#13;
*  (for the ZMGS Team Leader) approving jointly with a Technical Adviser all applications for&#13;
matching grant support of under US$30,000, approving jointly with a Technical Adviser and&#13;
the ZimTrade chief executive all applications for US$30-50,000, and (together with a&#13;
Technical Adviser) making recommendations to the Steering Team or its designated&#13;
representative for all applications in excess of US$50,000;&#13;
*  establishing arrangements for making matching grant payments to service providers,&#13;
(together with the EDP Administrative Secretariat) ensuring that these payments are made,&#13;
and are in conformance with the criteria established for participation in the ZMGS;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 47 -                                     Annex A&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
* ensuring that the deliverables specified by firms in their applications are indeed completed as&#13;
intended; and&#13;
* evaluating annually the subsequent performance of firms supported by the ZMGS.&#13;
50.           Specialist Management Contracting Services. The firm  responsible for providing&#13;
these specialist services will be appointed by the Steering Team for an initial period on the basis of a&#13;
competitive bid. The winning contractor could be an international firm, a Zimbabwean firm, or a joint&#13;
international-Zimbabwean bid. Key qualifications would include:&#13;
* a demonstrated track record of the contracting firm (and its designated staff) in working with&#13;
firms to prepare programs for enhancing competitiveness and productivity;&#13;
* a diverse roster of consultants capable of providing high-level specialist advice to firms&#13;
across a varied array of subsectors; and&#13;
* intimate knowledge of the range of business support services available in the international&#13;
marketplace, and the ability to help Zimbabwean firms tap into that network.&#13;
It would also be desirable if the winning bidder included on its team be an individual with prior&#13;
experience in managing an export-oriented matching grant scheme.&#13;
III. Facilitating Export-Oriented Foreign-Domestic Enterprise Collaboration Through&#13;
Matchmaking&#13;
A. Objective&#13;
51.            The objective of the sub-component is to build Zimbabwean firms' export capability by&#13;
facilitating export-oriented enterprise collaboration between small and medium local and foreign partners&#13;
through a private matchmaking scheme. The foreign partners will bring a package of external market&#13;
access and production know-how with or without investment finance.&#13;
B. Rationale&#13;
52.            Package of Factors Including Market Access.  In light of the early stage of&#13;
Zimbabwe's manufactured export development, one effective way to deal with local potential exporters'&#13;
lack of: (i) access to the external market network and market information for export products; (ii) access&#13;
to exportable production know-how; and (iii) access to the external market network and information on&#13;
input sourcing is to promote export-oriented foreign enterprise collaboration in diversified forms. These&#13;
collaborations provide a package of (i)-(iii) and offer the best opportunities for local partners through&#13;
immediate entry into the world market as well as acquisition of skills in these areas.&#13;
53.           Resolving Imperfect Information Issues. An earlier World Bank study4 of both the&#13;
demand and supply sides of export-oriented inter-firm collaboration confirmed that foreign collaborators'&#13;
lack of interest in collaboration with local firms in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) stems primarily from&#13;
severe imperfect information on export-oriented collaboration opportunities and negative images.&#13;
See Yung Whee Rhee and Therese Belot, Export Catalysts in Low-income Countries: A Review of Eleven Success Stories, World&#13;
Bank Discussion Papers #72, The World Bank. 1990.&#13;

Business Services Component&#13;
54.           This program would ease imperfect information issues that exist in potential supply&#13;
countries by giving incentives to private intermediaries to use their existing information networks to&#13;
bring together foreign export-oriented and local manufacturers in formal collaborations such as&#13;
international subcontracting agreements (SC), technical and/or marketing agreements (T/MA), joint&#13;
ventures (JV) and foreign direct investment (FDI), and licensing agreements (LA).&#13;
55.           Matchmaker Activities.  The activities of a private matchmaker would include&#13;
identification of potential foreign collaborators, brokering information on business opportunities in the&#13;
recipient country, and use of their information network in the latter country to link foreign collaborators&#13;
with potential local partners to the extent that the matchmakers have developed such a local network.&#13;
C. Structure of Private Matchmaker Fee and Incentives&#13;
1. Performance-based Matchmaking Fee Payments&#13;
56.           The basic principles used in designing the matchmaking mechanism are:&#13;
(i)   the matchmaking fe&gt;e w,ill be collatoration contract performance-based; and&#13;
(ii)    matchmaking fee paymnents will bc shared between:&#13;
(a)   the Matchmaking Fund (MMF) established under the sub-project;&#13;
(b)    foreign partner; and&#13;
(c)    a local partner.&#13;
57.           The criteria for determining the level and timing of (a) would be:&#13;
(i)    transparency of contract performance indicators;&#13;
(ii)   safeguard of contract implementation;&#13;
(iii)  relative simplicity of administering the scheme;&#13;
(iv)   sufficient incentives for the matchmaker; and&#13;
(v)    willingness of the local and foreign partners to pay for matchmaker services.&#13;
2. Implementation of Matchmaking Fee Payments&#13;
58.           Matchmaker Payment Preference. In an earlier empirical investigation of foreign/&#13;
domestic collaboration mechanisms, potential matchmakers expressed a preference for a success fee in&#13;
proportion to the collaboration contract value at the time of contract agreement, as opposed to a fee in&#13;
proportion to actual export eamings.&#13;
59.           Collaborator's Payment Preference.  In contrast to the matchmakers' stated&#13;
preferences, local and foreign collaborators would be willing to pay a matchmaker fee in proportion to&#13;
actual export earnings once these have been realized, since actual export earnings ultimately determine&#13;
the extent to which the local and the foreign partners are better off because of the matchmaker's&#13;
intermediation.&#13;
60.           Two-stage Payment. In order to accommodate the conflicting preferences indicated&#13;
above, a two-stage payment would be used:&#13;
&#13;

- 50-                                    Annex A&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
61.           The MM Management Contractor will monitor project implementation and calculate the&#13;
level and timing of Installment payment I accordingly, on the basis of explicit criteria. In turn, the 20%&#13;
share of Installment I and all of Installment 11 will be made by the parties to the collaboration contract&#13;
according to a private, three-way contractual agreement (i.e., between the Matchmaker, the foreign and&#13;
the local collaborator). While no 'model contracts' will be imposed for Installment 11, the scheme's&#13;
administration should insist that the private parties to the agreement incorporate into their formal&#13;
agreement the contract performance indicators in Chart Al. While the MMF will not guarantee&#13;
Installment 11, as a measure to build the Matchmaker's confidence that Installment 11 will be made, the&#13;
scheme's administration should maintain an information base (built around reports provided by the&#13;
Zimbabwean firm and its foreign collaborator) on the subsequent course of private collaboration&#13;
agreements "catalyzed" by the MMF.&#13;
62.           Safeguard Against Moral Hazard. In order to safeguard against moral hazard (i.e., the&#13;
Matchmaker's moral hazard in the case of a 'free ride' or the foreign/domestic collaborator's moral&#13;
hazard in the case of failure of contract implementation), Installment I will not be made unless the&#13;
scheme's Manager can verify that: (i) the collaboration has been mainly based on the Matchmaker's&#13;
efforts; (ii) the contract has been implemented.  Moral hazard on the part the foreign/ domestic&#13;
collaborators can also be prevented through their 50% contribution to Installment 1.&#13;
63.           Transparency of Fee Structure. Transparency of the matchmaking fee structure will&#13;
be critical in inducing potential matchmakers to participate in the scheme. The first step to ensure&#13;
transparency would be to clearly define the critical parameters determining the fee (export earnings,&#13;
collaboration contract value, implementation verification) (see Chart Al).&#13;
64.           Limit on MMF Matching Grant. In order to accommodate a maximum number of&#13;
collaborations given limited resources, the maximum amount of matching grant from the MMF would be&#13;
set at US$50,000 for any one collaboration contract.&#13;
65.           Advance on Performance-based Matchmaker Fee.  The MMF is designed as a&#13;
performance-based initiative, so in general no advances on performance-based fees will be provided.&#13;
Under exceptional circumstances, though, it may be helpful for the MMF to advance from Installment I&#13;
the costs of selected (i.e., pre-screened) potential matchmakers on an initial all-expenses-paid&#13;
information mission to Zimbabwe. Thereafter the costs of the Matchmaker's travel expenses associated&#13;
with their subsequent inward foreign collaborator missions could be shared between the MMF and the&#13;
Matchmaker. The levels and timing of advances depend on proposals the Matchmaker will submit,&#13;
detailing the expected collaboration contracts they will bring, as well as estimated collaboration contract&#13;
value and projected export eamings. Should the Matchmakers' intermediation be successful and a&#13;
collaboration agreement be made, then the advance would be subtracted from the fund's payment of&#13;
Installment I to the Matchmaker. Should a collaboration contract not materialize, however, matchmakers&#13;
will not be expected to reimburse the fund. Over the lifetime of the MMF, no more than US$50,000&#13;
should be disbursed as advances to support the travel costs of either matchmakers or their potential&#13;
foreign collaborators (see below).&#13;
66.           The ability of a Matchmaker to induce potential foreign collaborators to make&#13;
exploratory visits to Zimbabwe before committing to any formal collaboration agreements may also&#13;
depend on assistance from the MMF. Potential foreign collaborators may be willing to participate in&#13;
inward missions only if their expenses associated with project and local collaborator search costs can be&#13;
shared. The MMF could offer matching grants regarding travel and local expenses not automatically, but&#13;
should the need arise.&#13;

D. Eligibility of Collaboration Forms, Sectors, and Supply Sources&#13;
67.            Chart A2 below provides a summary of the framework for eligibility, sectors and supply&#13;
sources:&#13;
Chart A2: Eligibility of Collaboration Forms, Sectors. and Supply Sources&#13;
Variable                Guideline&#13;
Eligible Foreign-domestic  *  Joint Ventures&#13;
Collaboration Forms     *   100% Foreign Direct Investment (special case of foreign-domestic collaboration)&#13;
*  Technical and/or Marketing Agreements and Licensing Agreements&#13;
*  International Subcontracting Agreements&#13;
Eligible Manufacturing    Without any intention of 'targeting', the following sectors are initially selected for&#13;
Subsectors for Foreign-    eligibility in the matchmaking scheme because: (i) foreign export-oriented collaboration is&#13;
domestic Collaboration    currently not taking place spontaneously in these sectors; (ii) there are currently no or&#13;
negligible exports in these subsectors; and (iii) foreign/domestic collaboration agreements&#13;
are pervasive in these subsectors for successful export activities:&#13;
*      garments&#13;
a      textiles&#13;
a      footwear&#13;
-      leather&#13;
*      luggage&#13;
*      fumiture&#13;
e      processed food&#13;
*      toys&#13;
*      sports goods&#13;
*      engineering goods&#13;
*      electronics&#13;
*      tourism&#13;
Eligible Foreign        Scheme's initial focus is on attracting foreign collaborators from outside the region&#13;
Collaboration Supply    because the objective is to enable local manufacturers to acquire skills not yet available in&#13;
Sources                 the sub-region and other SSA countries.&#13;
MMF Administration      Administration of the MMF would imply the following major tasks:&#13;
Tasks&#13;
*  Advertising the Scheme. Advertisements providing general information about the&#13;
scheme would be placed periodically in relevant publications (e.g., newspapers,&#13;
business association publications) in Zimbabwe and foreign collaboration supply&#13;
countries. Brochures describing the scheme in more detail and explaining the 'rules'&#13;
of participation would then be provided to those potential matchmakers signaling&#13;
interest in the scheme.&#13;
*  Pre-screening. Matchmakers will be required to submit proposals before starting any&#13;
intermediation in order to qualify for any payments from the MMF. This may reduce&#13;
the risk of the MMF paying for collaboration activities that were already occurring&#13;
without the incentives offered under the matchmaking scheme.&#13;
*  Substitution for Private Local Matchmakers. In the case that foreign matchmakers do&#13;
not have the same developed information network that they would have to identify&#13;
potential foreign collaborators, it would be critical that the MM Management&#13;
Contractor identify local partners in a pro-active manner.&#13;
* Coordination of Inward Missions of Potential Foreign Collaborators. Should foreign&#13;
matchmakers not have sufficient information on Zimbabwe's investment and&#13;
collaboration environment, the MM Management Contractor would be responsible for&#13;
designing a program to introduce foreign matchmakers to collaboration opportunities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                                       Annex A&#13;
Business Services Component&#13;
and business environment in Zimbabwe. While the actual execution of inward&#13;
missions would be the primary responsibility of the private matchmaker, the MM&#13;
Management Contractor could, as needed, closely collaborate with the matchmaker to&#13;
arrange meetings and promotional activities (i.e. with ZimTrade and ZIC).&#13;
*  Monitoring of Collaboration Project Implementation. In order to determine level and&#13;
timing of Installment 1, the MMF administration would have to verify actual project&#13;
implementation (see Chart AI).&#13;
*  Monitoring of the Scheme's Effectiveness. Implemented projects should be formally&#13;
monitored for the period of the scheme in order to determine its effectiveness. This&#13;
task would also imply writing periodic reports to be submitted to the oversight&#13;
committee on experience with the scheme and formulation of recommendations&#13;
should policy changes be necessary.&#13;
Institutional Location'  The scheme would be run by a MM Management Contractor who would be housed in a&#13;
Affiliation             location set up for the exclusive use of the Project.&#13;
Cooperation between ZIC   The scheme's Manager would be able to liaise with ZimTrade staff and use the&#13;
and ZimTrade            institutional resources ZimTrade can provide. The Manager would coordinate activities&#13;
with ZIC through designated counterparts such as the Assistant Director of Marketing and&#13;
the staff responsible for ZIC's existing database on local joint venture partners.&#13;
Oversight               The oversight for the scheme would be carried out by the MM Management Contractor&#13;
supported by a management contract, assisted by a Technical Adviser, and reporting to the&#13;
Steering Team. Since agreement that a MM can participate/enroll in the program in&#13;
principle commits the MMF to pay up to US$50,000 should the matchmaker perform as&#13;
outlined above, all applications to enroll as a matchmaker in the program will need the&#13;
approval of the Steering Team or its designated representative.&#13;
68.            MMF Period and Estimated Total Costs. The program would be supported for a three&#13;
year period, after which it is expected that foreign/domestic collaboration activities in Zimbabwe will&#13;
occur spontaneously. The cost of operating the scheme would be US$1.7 million, of which US$1.5&#13;
million is for the MMF and US$0.2 million is for the full-time MM Management Contractor. An&#13;
estimated total of 40 collaboration cases could be supported.&#13;

ZIMBABWE&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Finance Component&#13;
I.           Introduction. The objectives of the Finance Component are to increase-the supply of&#13;
term funds available to Small and Medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as the supply of pre- and post-&#13;
shipment financing for emerging exporters. Guarantee facilities aim to reduce some of the risk of&#13;
subborrowers in these markets. The hope is that by alleviating the financial constraint to these&#13;
enterprises, many can grow on a sustainable basis and thus broaden participation and generate&#13;
employment.&#13;
I. SME Finance Facility (SME Finance Fund)&#13;
2.           Introduction and Objective. Financial services and, in particular, capital in the form of&#13;
loans, are severely limited to SMEs in Zimbabwe. More specifically, uncertainty and the term structure&#13;
of interest rates has led to limited and prohibitively priced medium-term financing options for financial&#13;
institutions to fund the investment and permanent working capital needs of their customers. Other&#13;
factors beyond this project's scope that have contributed to constraints on institutional finance include a&#13;
decline in financial institution lending to the private sector reflecting limited aggregate demand for credit&#13;
due to high interest rates and higher risk free returns on GOZ Treasury Bills and other money market&#13;
instruments. A lack of institutional capability in the formal financial sector to adequately assess SME&#13;
projects has also limited credit and is being addressed elsewhere in this project.&#13;
3.           The objective of the SME Finance Fund is to increase the supply of term funding at&#13;
market rates available to and bank and non-bank financial institutions in order to finance the demands of&#13;
emerging SMEs. The aim is to help to accelerate the activities already initiated by several banks and&#13;
non-banks and, potentially, NGOs to deliver financial services to SMEs on a commercially-viable basis.&#13;
This component would provide US$25 million equivalent in sub-loans which would mobilize&#13;
approximately US$31.3 million including sub-borrower contributions.&#13;
4.           Eligible Borrowers. Definitions of SMEs in Zimbabwe are difficult to discern since the&#13;
labor and capital intensity of enterprises varies so widely. The classification of SMEs made by Small&#13;
Business Units of Zimbabwean commercial banks varies from less than 20 employees to less than 150.&#13;
Some credit lines also differentiate SMEs by net asset size or turnover, each of which has its limitations.&#13;
Eligible borrowers under this project would include companies with up to 50 employees and with up to&#13;
US$200,000 in net assets. Sub-loans would be made in Zim$ up to a size limit of US$75,000 equivalent.&#13;
While this limit would be specified at project initiation, the Steering Team, could in consultation with&#13;
IDA, modify the credit ceiling at a later date. Under the assumption that the average SME credit would&#13;
be US$50,000, the sub-component amount of US$25 million would finance approximately 500 new SME&#13;
borrowers over a four-year period.&#13;
5.           Operational Guidelines.  Below  is a summary of the SME Finance Facility's&#13;
operational guidelines:&#13;

Interest Rate Charged by    Average cost of funds of commercial banks, as determined by a quarterly rolling average,&#13;
Apex to PFls             computed by the RBZ and announced and repriced quarterly. All outstanding balances&#13;
would be reprised. Repricing from PFIs to subborrowers should reflect the same timing and&#13;
repricing mechanism.&#13;
Interest Rate Charged by    PFIs would be fully free to charge a rate commensurate with the costs and risks of sub-loans.&#13;

Currency ofSub-loans     Commitments, disbursements and repayments in Zim$. Withdrawal applications from the&#13;
Special Account would be made in the US$ equivalent of the Zim$ amount.&#13;
Maturity of Sub-loans    Funds could be used for permanent working capital, i.e. a net medium-term increase in the core&#13;
working capital need, as well as for investments. The PFI would be required to onlend at the&#13;
same maturity as funds lent from the Apex. The maximum maturity would be limited to five&#13;
years. The minimum maturity suggested would be one year.&#13;
Grace Period             A grace period of up to 18 months could be provided to the subproject upon the approval by&#13;
the Apex. The grace period (principal only) would be matched by the sub-loan between the&#13;
PFI and the SME.&#13;
Maximum Sub-loan Size    US$75,000 equivalent, subject to periodic change as necessawy by the Steering Team in&#13;
consultation with IDA.&#13;
Maximum Borrower Firm    Maximum 50 employees and US$200,000 in net assets (Total Assets of the firm, excluding&#13;
Size                     land, adjusted by depreciation), subject to periodic change as necessary by the Steering Team,&#13;

Application Requirements   Application to Apex would be a summary formn providing data on the name, size and sector of&#13;
the firm and nature of the sub-project, level of financing and the names of principals. Detailed&#13;
financial project data would not be included. Applications from the PFI to the SME would be&#13;
at the discretion of the PFI.&#13;
Eligible Sectors         All sectors. Mortgage lending and real estate purchases would not be eligible.&#13;
Eligible &amp;penditures     Refinancing existing sub-loans would not be eligible. Borrowers with non-performing loans in&#13;
any PFI could not be granted initial or additional loans under the project.&#13;
Autonomous Free Limits    Because of the limits in sub-loan size, all projects could be approved by the Apex. Reviews&#13;
by IDA would be on an ex-post basis.&#13;
Audit Requirements       *  Fund Project Account audited annually;&#13;
*   PFIs must submit audits annually to the Apex and IDA&#13;
*   Statement of Expenditures of PFIs subject to random export audits; and&#13;
*   Random ex-post reviews conducted to individual sub-loans indicating compliance with&#13;
procurement and disbursement requirements.-&#13;

11. SME Credit Guarantee Facility (SME Credit Guarantee Fund)&#13;
6.             Rationale and Objectives.  The purpose of the SME Credit Guarantee Fund is to&#13;
encourage financial institutions to lend to entrepreneurs with viable projects and good prospects of&#13;
success but whose perceived risk is greater than their actual risk because the borrowers are unable to&#13;
provide adequate collateral or do not have a suitable credit history to prove that they are creditworthy.&#13;
This responds to an identified need for a support mechanism to overcome this obstacle. Thus, the&#13;
Guarantee Fund is intended to assist in increasing formal-sector financing to SMEs. The design is&#13;
intended to encourage financial institution lending by mitigating some of the credit risk on guaranteed&#13;
loans. The scheme's design is intended to be simple enough so that participation does not add materially&#13;
to a financial institution's transaction costs, create uncertainty through the reimbursement mechanism,&#13;
nor create too large a burden to the SME through the commission charged.&#13;
7.             Operational Guidelines. Below is a summary of the SME Credit Guarantee Facility's&#13;
operational guidelines:&#13;
Chart B2: SME Credit Guarantee Facility - Operational Guidelines&#13;
Variable         Guideline&#13;
Eligibility      *  In principle, all sub-loans financed under the SME Finance Facility would be eligible for&#13;
coverage by the SME Credit Guarantee, except as stipulated in the restrictions below. Neither&#13;
sub-loans nor guarantees would be provided to refinance any portion of a PFI's existing exposure&#13;
to a borrower.&#13;
*  Guarantee approval would be the responsibility of PFIs, subject to subsequent approval of the&#13;
CGA.&#13;
Documentation    PFIs must provide a statement of prior and existing exposure to a borrower and must attest that the&#13;
Requirements     guarantee would apply only to incremental (increased) loans to an existing client or initial loans to&#13;
new clients. The PFI would provide the Credit Guarantee Agency (CGA) with a summary of the&#13;
transaction on a form (not exceeding 2 pages), which would give details on the borrower, the&#13;
transaction (amount, terms, conditions and maturity) and the amount of guarantee requested. This&#13;
form should also detail the PFI's past and existing relationship with the client. The CGA would check&#13;
for client and loan eligibility.&#13;
Risk Coverage -   The Guarantee fund would cover 50% of the credit risk for the outstanding principal of covered SME&#13;
Safeguard        sub-loans. Once an individual PFI's losses of loans guaranteed under the program have exceeded&#13;
Provisions       15%, new loans would be guaranteed at a rate of 25%. No additional loans would be guaranteed if a&#13;
PFI's loss rate on guaranteed loans exceeds 40%. PFIs that lose their eligibility can regain full&#13;
coverage only by collecting enough of the defaulted loan balances to reduce their default ratio below&#13;
15% or 40%, respectively. The use of write-offs or refinancing to achieve the 15% target would be&#13;
prohibited and reviewed by the CGA.&#13;
Credit           The Guarantee would be administered by the CGA, in association with the Apex. The responsibilities&#13;
Guarantee        of the CGA would be:&#13;
Administration    *  Receive and review documentation on loans guaranteed by it;&#13;
*   Verifying the eligibility of the PFI and sub-project. Initial documentation should include a&#13;
history the PFI's credit relationship with the borrower and a certification that the loan to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Finance Component&#13;
guaranteed is not a refinancing of existing or past credit';&#13;
*  Receive and review quarterly reports from PFIs;&#13;
*   Inquire about efforts to collect or bring current, past due loans.&#13;
*  Review requests for exercise of the guarantee, verify the eligibility of the request and assure that&#13;
prudent banking practices have been followed in disbursing, administering and attempting to&#13;
collect the loan.&#13;
*   Facilitate reimbursement for approved guarantee claims, optimally within 30 days of receipt of a&#13;
request for guarantee execution.&#13;
*  Encourage PFIs to make every recovery effort possible for sub-loan repayment.&#13;
Guarantee        PFI's would be required to report quarterly to the CGA on the status of all loans made under the&#13;
Execution        Project. Special note would be given to loans 30 days or more past due and efforts to collect them in&#13;
the normal course of business would be detailed. Once a loan is 90 days past due, interest accruals&#13;
should cease. Once litigation has been initiated, a request to execute the guarantee should be made to&#13;
the CGA. The agreement with the PFI's should stipulate that the PFI can receive a 60% share of any&#13;
recoveries made by its efforts in litigation or through other means after guarantee execution, including&#13;
seizure and disposal of any collateral, excluding cash. Any cash collateral should be applied to the&#13;
outstanding balance before any amount is paid under the guarantee. A request to the CGA for&#13;
payment under the guarantee should be paid within 30 days of its receipt. Certified copies of all&#13;
documentation related to the loan should be forwarded from the PFI to the CGA. Post execution&#13;
collection efforts would be distributed between the CGA and the PFI including the share to which&#13;
each is entitled of any sums collected.&#13;
Premia Rate and   Each PFI would pay the CGA a three percent fee on the guaranteed portion of its portfolio, subject to&#13;
Calculation      review by the Steering Team in consultation with IDA. This fee would be paid once, up front, on the&#13;
level of funds to be guaranteed. The fee could be passed along to the borrower.&#13;
Audit            The CGA would require annual audit reports verifying that guaranteed loans were not used to&#13;
Requirements    refinance existing client debt. Annual audits would be conducted on the project account, including&#13;
the account of the SME Credit Guarantee Fund. In this context, it is expected that: (i) the CGA&#13;
would keep separate accounts for each sub-borrower; and (ii) auditors would conduct select and&#13;
random reviews of subprojects to validate compliance with the terms and conditions of subprojects.&#13;
8.             Guarantee Fund Cash Flow Projections. Table BI below provides sensitivity analysis&#13;
as to the impact of various levels of default on the levels of losses to the SME Credit Guarantee Fund as&#13;
well as estimates the level of sub-loan reflows which would need to be channeled into such a fund based&#13;
on different loan loss scenarios. It is important to note that the 3.0% premium can only cover a loan loss&#13;
level of 7.0% (with 50% coverage). More likely, a 10% loan loss level (10% of new loans made go into&#13;
default, not 10% of the annual portfolio guaranteed) would result in US$0.6 million being diverted from&#13;
sub-loan recoveries into the Guarantee Fund. If it proves that the loss experience is greater than&#13;
expected resulting in an unforeseen drawdown of the funds, the Steering Team would be charged with&#13;
modifying the coverage and/or the premium, in consultation with IDA On the other hand, to the degree&#13;
that funds accumulate from premium revenues, these funds can be reallocated to the SME Finance Fund&#13;
as necessary. Because this intervention is aimed at providing a temporary inducement for financial&#13;
institutions to lend until such time as they have the understanding and capability to do so on their own,&#13;
the intent of the guarantee fund is to be time-bound.&#13;
Table B1: Cash Flow Projections for the SME Credit Guarantee Fund&#13;
(US$ Millions)&#13;
Scenario 1: 2.0% Default&#13;
Assumptions:&#13;
Annual Rate of Default                       2.0%&#13;
Total SME Onlending Covered by Guarantee     25.0&#13;
Premium Paid into Fund                       3.0%&#13;
Given the overlap of information requirements between the CGA and the Apex, the sub-project summary form for financing would also&#13;
be submitted to the CGA.&#13;

lII. Export Finance Facility (Export Finance Fund)&#13;
9.               Introduction and Objective. The objective of the Export Finance Fund is to respond to&#13;
a foreign currency supply constraint by financing the pre- and post-shipment working capital needs of&#13;
emerging direct and (manufacturing) indirect exporters. The Project would finance exports of emerging&#13;
enterprises through a foreign currency pre- and post-shipment export finance revolving fund (Export&#13;
Finance Fund). The pre- and post-shipment export financing would be implemented as an integrated&#13;
product with the Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantee indicated in Section IV below.&#13;
10.              The rationale behind providing this export financing is to mitigate a funding supply&#13;
constraint identified. This constraint emanates from a practice whereby foreign banks have generally&#13;
supplied off-shore credit lines to local financial institutions with the understanding that the loans are&#13;
exclusively for well-established companies as well as within the Zimbabwe country risk limit). As such,&#13;
only well-established exporters have had access to funds supplied to financial institutions from these&#13;
foreign sources. By sourcing funds to these institutions at their average cost of funds, the aim is to avoid&#13;
replacing existing US$ financing. In the same vein, the disbursement mechanism should be efficient and&#13;
streamlined in order to be competitive with existing mechanisms based on these off-shore credit lines.&#13;
11.              Access to post-shipment finance by direct exporters generally is handled mainly through&#13;
post-shipment finance mechanisms such as bankers' acceptance (BA) discounting or completed export&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

bill (backed by the export credit insurance or guarantee) discounting at local banks and rediscounting&#13;
based on off-shore credit lines except for those exporters who cannot access such post-shipment finance.&#13;
Yet emerging exporters with access difficulties for pre-shipment financing often have similar difficulties&#13;
for post-shipment finance, even when the post-shipment period is backed by a confirmed letter of credit.&#13;
As such, this project would provide for selective support of these enterprises. In order to ultimately&#13;
include all indirect exporters currently excluded from the foreign currency export loans, it is hoped that&#13;
in the medium-term a back-to-back domestic L/C system would be introduced.&#13;
12.            Operational Guidelines.  Below  is a summary of the Export Finance Facility's&#13;
operational guidelines:&#13;

Interest Rate    Average cost of US$ funding of commercial and merchant banks from offshore sources as determined&#13;
Charged by       by a quarterly rolling average, computed by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), announced and&#13;
Apex to PFIs    repriced quarterly on all balances. Repricing from PFIs to subborrowers should reflect the same&#13;
repricing mechanism. Currently, the ceiling established by the Reserve Bank for off-shore credit lines&#13;
for export loans is LIBOR + 0.875%, which would be the initial rate charged on funds. This rate&#13;
would be subject to change by the Steering Team in accordance with changes in market conditions.&#13;
Interest Rate -  PFIs would be fully free to charge a rate commensurate with the costs and risks of sub-loans.&#13;
PFIs to&#13;
subborrowers&#13;
Currency of Sub-  Commitments, disbursements and repayments would be denominated in US$. Cash payments by the&#13;
loans            sub-borrower could be made in the Zim$ equivalent to the US$ balance payable.&#13;
Maturity of Sub-   *   The maturity of the sub-loan and the exporter's Promissory Note would be from the time of&#13;

2       PFI export finance disbursement mechanisms that tie the loan disbursement to the payments to the overseas suppliers (through back-&#13;
to back import L/C negotiations) and the domestic suppliers (through the back-to-back domestic L/C negotiations) would be encouraged. The&#13;
PFI's risk-taking of the exporter's moral hazard could then be reduced to the remaining part of the loan (i.e. the value added part for which the&#13;
cash will be given to the exporter).&#13;

13.          Size and Impact of the Export Finance Fund. The size of the Export Finance Fund&#13;
would be US$35 million. Assuming that the Fund finances on average 80% of the export orders and the&#13;
average turnover is four months, total export generated would be US$131 million. Assuming that the&#13;
average financing is US$100,000 and one loan is provided per exporter, this means that 350 exporters&#13;
would be supported.&#13;
IV. Export Finance Guarantee Fund&#13;
14.          Introduction. The objective of the Export Finance Guarantee is to cover a portion of&#13;
emerging exporters' non-performance risk so in order to overcome a supply rigidity whereby the&#13;
perceived risk of these exporters is greater than the actual risk. This difference between actual and&#13;
perceived risks may come about because of: (i) the borrower has inadequate physical collateral (and the&#13;
bank is unaccustomed to making uncollateralized export finance transactions); (ii) the borrower has a&#13;
limited track record; and (iii) banks' reluctance to commit resources to conduct thorough credit&#13;
investigations of infant or small and medium size (SME) direct or indirect exporters for fear of losing the&#13;
up-front costs involved.&#13;
15.          Since 1991, Credsure (the Credit Insurance Zimbabwe Limited) has offered a Export&#13;
Finance Guarantee scheme that protects banks granting preshipment export finance against exporters'&#13;
manufacturing nonperformance risks, along with export credit insurance and guarantee schemes that&#13;
protect exporters and banks against foreign buyers' nonpayment risks. Despite the expected high&#13;
demand for the Export Finance Guarantee, Credsure had, at mid-1995, issued only three outstanding&#13;
Export Finance Guarantees. These Guarantee payments are 100% reinsured by the Government just as&#13;
political risk export credit insurance payments through the Reinsurance Committee based on the Export&#13;
Credit Reinsurance Act. The contingent liabilities associated with the political risk export credit&#13;
insurance policies alone at Credsure appear to be above international norms. There are three major&#13;
reasons for the negligible use to date of the existing Export Finance Guarantee: (i) the lack of a Fund that&#13;
can back up the contingent liabilities associated with any significantly expanded use of the Export&#13;
Finance Guarantee in a way separated from the Export Credit Reinsurance Fund. The latter primarily&#13;
covers contingent liabilities associated with the political risk coverage of the export credit insurance; (ii)&#13;
the commercial and merchant banks' reluctance to take 30% of SME or infant exporters' manufacturing&#13;
nonperformance risks or to put their resources for the credit investigations of these exporters; and (iii)&#13;
insufficient marketing of the guarantee scheme.&#13;
16.          Financing of the Export Finance Guarantee. The financing mechanism for the Export&#13;
Finance Guarantee would function as follows: (i) Premiums collected by the Apex would be deposited&#13;
into an interest-bearing account; (ii) payouts would be made from the same account; (iii) Recoveries&#13;
from the SME and Export Finance funds would, as necessary be transferred from the Project accounts&#13;
established for sub-loans to the project account established to backstop potential losses under the&#13;
guarantee. The mechanics of reimbursement would work as follows: (i) defaulting sub-loans would be&#13;
entitled to 80% reimbursement; (ii) once a sub-loan is confirmed by the CGA to be entitled to&#13;
compensation, the Apex would debit the Guarantee Fund account and credit the PFI's project account for&#13;
the compensated balance. This would effectively exonerate the PFI from repayment to the Reserve&#13;
Bank for 80% of the outstanding balance of the sub-loan respective, plus accrued interest.&#13;
17.          Operational Guidelines. Below is a summary of the Preshipment Export Finance&#13;
Guarantee Fund's operational guidelines:&#13;
&#13;

Finance Component&#13;
Chart B4: Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantee Fund - Operational Guidelines&#13;
Variable         Guidelines&#13;
Eligibility      *  In principle, all preshipment export sub-loans financed under the Export Finance Facility&#13;
would be eligible for coverage by the Preshipment Export Finance Guarantee, except as&#13;
stipulated in the restrictions below. Neither sub-loans nor guarantees would be provided to&#13;
refinance any portion of a PFI's existing exposure to a borrower.&#13;
*  Guarantee approval would be the responsibility of PFls, subject to subsequent approval of&#13;
the CGA.&#13;
Documentary      *  Confirmed export L/C, other export order backed by export credit insurance, or&#13;
requirements        (manufacturing) domestic L/C created on a back-to-back basis based on the above export&#13;
order;&#13;
*   Integrated application form for the sub-loan and the Preshipment Export Finance Guarantee'.&#13;
*   Integrated application forn submitted by PFI to CGA should be simple and the required&#13;
information should focus on the export transaction itself, rather than detailed financial&#13;
statements of the exporter.&#13;
Maximum          For a single turn-over of an export sub-loan, US$150,000.&#13;
Guarantee Size&#13;
Guarantee Risk   The CGA would cover 80% of the value of the export loan (and up to 90 days associated interest)&#13;
Coverage         default risks stemming from exporters' nonperformance&#13;
Premium Rate    A premium rate of 0. 15% would be charged on the monthly balance of the sub-loans outstanding&#13;
covered by the Guarantee. This is an annual equivalent of 1.8%.&#13;
Guarantee       As per the export finance sub-loan.&#13;
Maturity&#13;
Reporting        *  The financial intermediary's reporting requirements to the CGA would be: (i) the nature of&#13;
Requirement         the sub-loan; (ii) the guaranteed loan effective date; (iii) export completion date; (iv) loan&#13;
liquidation date; and (v) default date.&#13;
*   PFI's would be required to report quarterly to the CGA on the status of all loans made under&#13;
the Project. Special note would be given to loans 30 days or more past due, and efforts to&#13;
collect them in the normal course of business would be detailed.&#13;
Safeguard        The Preshipment Export Credit Guarantee fund would cover 80% of the non-performance risk of&#13;
Provisions       the outstanding principal of covered sub-loans amount plus accrued interest up to 90 days. Once&#13;
an individual PFI's losses of loans guaranteed under the program have exceeded 15%, new loans&#13;
would be guaranteed at a rate of 25%. No additional loans would be guaranteed if a PFI's loss&#13;
rate on guaranteed loans exceeds 40%. PFIs that lose their eligibility can regain full coverage&#13;
only by collecting enough of the defaulted loan balances to reduce their default ratio below 15%&#13;
or 40%, respectively. The use of write-offs or refinancing to achieve the targets would be&#13;
prohibited and reviewed by the CGA. Once a loan is 90 days past due, interest accruals should&#13;
cease, and the guarantee would be eligible to be called provided litigation against the borrower&#13;
has been instituted. PFIs would be able to receive 30% of any recoveries made by its efforts after&#13;
a loan has gone 90 days past due, but prior to execution of the guarantee, including seizure and&#13;
disposal of any collateral, excluding cash.  Any cash collateral should be applied to the&#13;
outstanding balance before any amount is paid under the guarantee.&#13;
Financial Flows  The financing mechanism  for the Export Finance Guarantee would function as follows: (i)&#13;
of the Guarantee  Premiums collected by the PFI and the Apex would be deposited into an interest-bearing account;&#13;
Fund--          (ii) payouts would be made from the same account; (iii) sub-loan recoveries from the Export&#13;
3      As emerging exporters develop a track record, then. in a later stage, a revolving guarantee could be offered based on the records of&#13;
past export performance.&#13;

Guarantee        *  The financial intermediary should report arrears to the Guarantee Agency within 30 days of&#13;
Execution -          default. Guarantee payment claims would be eligible after 3 months have passed since the&#13;
Procedures for       loan default occurred;&#13;
Processing       *  The mechanics of reimbursement would work as follows: (i) defaulting sub-loans would be&#13;
Claims               entitled to reimbursement of 80% of the accumulated balance (principal and interest accrued&#13;
up to 90 days); (ii) once a sub-loan is confirmed by the Guarantee Agency to be entitled to&#13;
compensation, the Apex would debit the Guarantee Fund account and credit the PFI's project&#13;
account for the compensated balance.  This would effectively exonerate the PFI from&#13;
repayment to the Reserve Bank for 80% of the outstanding balance of the sub-loan&#13;
respective, plus accrued interest.&#13;
Audit            The CGA would require annual audit reports verifying that guaranteed loans were not used to&#13;
Requirements    refinance existing client debt.  Annual audits would be conducted on the project account,&#13;
including the account of the SME Credit Guarantee Fund. In this context, it is expected that: (i)&#13;
the CGA would keep separate accounts for each sub-borrower; and (ii) auditors would conduct&#13;
select and random reviews of subprojects to validate compliance with the terms and conditions of&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
Responsibilities   The CGA would be responsible to:&#13;
of the CGA       *   Review the information received for accuracy and check the consistency of documentation&#13;
provided. This would include a review of the export order, the L/C and/or the buyer's non-&#13;
payment risk coverage certificate to ensure coverage and to detect any possible falsification;&#13;
*   Verify the eligibility of the PFI and sub-project. Initial documentation should include a&#13;
history the PFI's credit relationship with the borrower and a certification that the loan to be&#13;
guaranteed is not a refinancing of existing or past credit5;&#13;
*   Receive and review quarterly reports from PFIs;&#13;
*   Inquire about efforts to collect or bring current, past due loans.&#13;
*   Review requests for exercise of the guarantee, verify the eligibility of the request and assure&#13;
that prudent banking practices have been followed in disbursing, administering and&#13;
attempting to collect the loan.&#13;
*   Facilitate reimbursement for approved guarantee claims, optimally within 30 days of receipt&#13;
of a request for guarantee execution.&#13;
*   Encourage PFIs to make every recovery effort possible for sub-loan repayment.&#13;
*   In the medium-term, provide a basic service to check to ensure that exporters using the&#13;
Guarantee are acting in good faith by checking past criminal or default records as well as the&#13;
validity of export orders and protection against foreign buyers' nonpayment risks.&#13;
MWarketing       The CGA should carry out a campaign to the banking and export communities through public&#13;
Campaign         media, seminars, and publications,&#13;
Review of the    Timely reviews and tabulation of exporter loan default data as well as the export success data of&#13;
State of Emerging emerging exporters should be used to provide input to the Steering Team for timely adjustments&#13;
Exporters        of the Guarantee's operational parameters.&#13;
Speedy Issue of   A seven working day target would be established for completing the Export Finance Guarantee&#13;
Export Finance   application process at the level of the financial intermediary and the Guarantee Agency, including&#13;
Guarantee        issuing the Finance Guarantee certificate.  Financial intermediaries should be encouraged to&#13;
Certificate      follow the Export Finance Guarantee application review guidelines to be issued by the CGA.&#13;
See projections below.&#13;
Given the overlap of information requirements between the CGA and the Apex, the sub-project summary form for financing would&#13;
also be submitted to the CGA.&#13;

V. Performance Guidelines and Certification Procedures for Participation of Financial&#13;
Intermediaries&#13;
A. Introduction - Eligible Institutions&#13;
19.             The purpose of the certification procedures detailed below is to ensure as far as possible&#13;
that resources under the Project are intermediated through only those participating financial intermnediaries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(PFIs) which can be reasonably determined to be solvent and well-managed in accordance with sound&#13;
financial practices and which operate in a way in which they will allocate funds productively to the SME or&#13;
emerging exporter markets respectively. With the assistance of external auditors, the Steering Team in&#13;
consultation with IDA would be responsible for qualifying institutions based on an evaluation of the&#13;
solvency, financial position and intermediation capacity of each prospective PFI.&#13;
20.           Participation in the Finance facilities would, in principle, be open to all financial&#13;
institutions licensed under the Banking Act6 as well as select State-owned institutions (SEDCO and&#13;
Zimbabwe Development Bank) and non-Governmental organizations on a case-by-case basis. The&#13;
evaluation of financial institutions (FIs) to participate under the project would be determined on the basis of&#13;
information and criteria set out in Sections B and C below. In cases where lending is proposed to a&#13;
subsidiary of a licensed bank holding company, the evaluation would be applied to both the parent and the&#13;
subsidiary on a consolidated basis.&#13;
21.           FIs would be certified for initial participation under the project and re-certified annually&#13;
for continued participation. Certification procedures would be as follows: (i) FIs would request their&#13;
external auditors to undertake an evaluation according to the criteria in Section C below; (ii) Applicant&#13;
Fls would submit the information indicated in Section B to the auditors; (iii) the Auditors would provide&#13;
written evaluations to the Steering Team and to IDA as to the FI's compliance with the criteria; and (iv)&#13;
the RBZ would have the right at any time to revoke the certification of FIs found to not to fully satisfy&#13;
the eligibility criteria or found by the RBZ to be in violation of the Banking Act or other laws or&#13;
prudential regulations.&#13;
B. Information Required&#13;
22.           The following written information FI's would be required to submit to Auditors, the&#13;
Steering Tean and IDA:&#13;
(a)    Annual audited financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles.&#13;
For new institutions, the above requirement could be waived and in its stead, replaced with&#13;
detailed financial projections outlining data according to the same reporting standards,&#13;
satisfactory to the Steering Team;&#13;
(b)    Unqualified audit opinion over the statements in "a" above. If this opinion is qualified,&#13;
required would be a satisfactory explanation and action plan from the management of the&#13;
financial intermediary for remedying the situation;&#13;
(c)    A special eligibility assessment conducted by external auditors according to the criteria in&#13;
Section C. This should include publication of information as to the amount of loans past&#13;
due (including overdrafts, so classified) affected by arrears, current and accumulated&#13;
provisions, and the criteria for each as well as the criteria for interest accrual and rollovers;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)    Any other information the Steering Team, RBZ or IDA may consider necessary for&#13;
purposes of conducting its assessment.&#13;
Or amended legislation as passed.&#13;

Finance Component&#13;
C. Eligibility Evaluation Criteria&#13;
23.            External Auditors contracted would examine an financial institution's financial position&#13;
according to the following guidelines:&#13;
(a)    Management.  A review should evaluate the financial management of the institution,&#13;
including its credit controls, planning mechanisms, staffing and information systems.&#13;
Audits should verify or comment on the following:&#13;
(i)    The Fl's Board of Directors sets overall financial policy and performs appropriate&#13;
oversight of the Institution's operations;&#13;
(ii)    The Fl has sound budget, planning and financial control procedures;&#13;
(iii)   The Fl has sound lending policies and procedures;&#13;
(iv)    The FI has sound internal controls and audit procedures;&#13;
(v)     The Fl has managers with adequate skills and experience to carry out their&#13;
respective tasks; and&#13;
(vi)    The Fl's management information system provides sufficient information to the&#13;
staff responsible for managing the Fl's risks and financial performance.&#13;
(b)    Capital Adequacy - The review should assess whether (where applicable) the financial&#13;
intermediary's risk-weighted capital adequacy is in compliance with guidelines laid down&#13;
by RBZ. If not applicable, the level of capital in relation to risk-adjusted assets should be&#13;
indicated, along with a qualitative evaluation of the sufficiency of such capital. As of June&#13;
1996, it is expected that commercial banks will be required to operate with minimum&#13;
capital adequacy ratios of 4% for Tier I capital and 6% for total net capital. By June 1997,&#13;
all commercial banks will be required to have a minimum capital adequacy of 4% for Tier I&#13;
capital and 8% for total net capital. Requirements for merchant banks and discounts would&#13;
be in accordance with guidelines to be issued;&#13;
(c)    Loan and Other Asset Quality. Assessment should be made of the risk profile of loans,&#13;
other assets and the sufficiency of capital to cover such risks. A detailed portfolio review&#13;
should be conducted in accordance with the guidelines indicated in Charts B5 and B6 on&#13;
the next pages. The certification should indicate whether the level of loan loss provisions&#13;
is sufficient and, if not, the qualified level of deficiency and a recalculation of capital based&#13;
on such a deficiency;&#13;
(d)    Collection Ratio. Auditors should consider whether the collection ratio is sufficient to&#13;
avoid erosion of the inflation-adjusted net worth of the FI7;&#13;
(e)    Earnings Performance.  Auditors should evaluate whether net income, adjusted for&#13;
inflation (as determined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)), provides a positive return on&#13;
equity with realistic provisions for losses. Negative real returns could be justified if they&#13;
are shown to reflect transitory conditions;&#13;
i.e., cash collections of principal and interest over total collectibles during the last 12 months' total collectibles comprise total arrears at&#13;
the beginning plus ainounts falling due during the period.&#13;

Finance Component&#13;
(f)    Liquidity Position. Auditors should evaluate whether the Fl has a sound liquidity position&#13;
and liquidity management systems. While the most important indicator of an institution's&#13;
liquidity position is its liquidity management capability, these other indicators should also&#13;
be assessed: (i) frequency and level of liquidity support from the RBZ; (ii) frequency of&#13;
borrowings from the inter-bank market; (iii) the relationship between new commitments&#13;
for loans and investments and the resources available to finance such commitments; and&#13;
(iv) liquidity maintained to meet maturing obligations (operating expenses and debt-&#13;
servicing liabilities);&#13;
(g)    Foreign Exchange Position. Auditors should assess whether the Fl has a proper foreign&#13;
exchange risk monitoring and control system in place as stated in RBZ guidelines; and&#13;
(h)    Intermediation Capacity. Auditors should review the capacity of the prospective PFI to&#13;
effectively initiate, appraise, process, monitor and supervise sub-loans to SMEs and&#13;
exporters.&#13;
E. Certification Procedures&#13;
24.           External Auditors would evaluate the Fl according to the performance guidelines above in&#13;
order to render an assessment of the Fl's soundness, solvency, risk concentration and capacity to&#13;
intermediate credit to SMEs and exporters. The Steering Team would decide based upon the analysis and&#13;
recommendation of the External Auditors whether to certify, not certify or partially certify (or recertify) a&#13;
financial institution to participate in the Project.&#13;
25.           Based on the assessment of variables indicated in Section C, institutions would be&#13;
certified or recertified into one of three categories: (1) fully eligible; (2) partially eligible; and (3) not&#13;
eligible. Institutions fully eligible would be entitled to intermediate funds under either the SME Fund or&#13;
Export Finance Fund up to the maximum exposure levels established for all institutions by the Steering&#13;
Team, in consultation with IDA. Institutions could be determined as partially eligible in cases where&#13;
deficiencies in performance criteria are noted but where the institution has submitted a detailed time-&#13;
bound action plan for remedying those deficiencies. The judgment of the viability of such an action&#13;
plan would be undertaken jointly by the Steering Team and IDA. Institutions could again become fully&#13;
eligible to participate at any time, providing they have been reassessed by External Auditors according&#13;
to the same criteria and, provided that such assessment indicates that their condition has improved&#13;
sufficiently to fully meet the criteria.&#13;
26.           Institutions found judged partially eligible would be eligible to borrow under the&#13;
Project lesser of: (i) 10% of the net capital and reserves of the institution (verified and, as necessary&#13;
restated by the External Auditors); or (ii) five percent of the total of the SME Finance Fund or Export&#13;
Finance Fund, respectively. These levels could be modified by the Steering Team, in consultation with&#13;
IDA. As above, once certification indicates full compliance with eligibility criteria, such institutions&#13;
would again be entitled to the full amount of their allocation under the Project.&#13;

Guidelines for Assessment of Commercial Financial Institution Credit Risks&#13;
Capital        The level of capital and reserves should be sufficient to cover the risks associated with assets on a risk-adjusted&#13;
Adequacy       basis. The Basle standard of 8% should be applied, in accordance with RBZ guidelines and weights.&#13;
Loan           An evaluation should review whether loans refinanced, rescheduled or renewed result from weaknesses in the&#13;
Rescheduling    Borrower's Financial Position and/or inability to repay. In such a case, evidence should show that the borrower can&#13;
demonstrate the capacity to service the loan under the new conditions of the contract. Credits classified as doubtful&#13;
or loss should not have been renegotiated unless such loans have either an improvement in the loan collateral or an&#13;
up-front cash payment. Loans rescheduled involving capitalization of interest (whereby uncollected interest is&#13;
added to unpaid principal at the payment date or maturity of a loan or advance) should have an increase in the value&#13;
of the collateral to cover the capitalized interest. A new loan resulting from the interest capitalization indicate that&#13;
the borrower has increased his or her capacity to service the loan under the new conditions of the contract. Credits&#13;
classified as substandard, doubtful or loss should not be eligible for interest capitalization.&#13;
Loan           Institutions should routinely conduct a review of 70% of their portfolio on an annual basis, according to the&#13;
Review         classification and provisioning criteria below. Non-performing loans, loans classified as substandard, doubtful or&#13;
Standards      loss and classified overdraft accounts should be reviewed monthly.&#13;
Provisioning    Useful provisioning guidelines are: Pass and special mention loans -no minimum required provision; Substandard&#13;
Guidelines     loans --an initial 10% provision with increases arriving at a 20% provision; Doubtful loans --a 50% provision; and&#13;
Loss loans a 100% provision. Provisions should be calculated after deducting the estimated value of collateral and&#13;
adding the legal and administrative costs for seizure and disposition of collateral as well as estimated asset&#13;
depreciation during the holding period for collateral.&#13;
Overdraft      *   Overdraft accounts should be reviewed by the PFI at least annually. Overdraft accounts should be classified&#13;
Accounts           as "Substandard" and subject to the provision schedule indicated above provided that: Interest charges for the&#13;
preceding 12 months have not been covered by deposits during the same period.&#13;
*   The overdraft has exceeded the authorized limit both frequently and without special authorization.&#13;
-   The overdraft has evidenced fluctuations and deposit patterns which do not conform with the normal cycle of&#13;
the borrower's business.&#13;
&#149;   Once classified as "Substandard", the overdraft should be converted to a "Substandard" loan. be reflected as&#13;
such on the balance sheet and be subject to revised conditions.&#13;
Investment     Fixed income investments should be reflected based on an estimate of their market value. Such a market value&#13;
Classification   should reflect, inter alia the difference between the interest rate on the instrument and the rate prevailing for&#13;
securities with similar maturities, and the risk of the security (or the underlying value of the assets securing it).&#13;
Central Govemment bonds and instruments with a Govemment guarantee should be valued to at least reflect the&#13;
coupon rate on the instrument. Equity investments should be reflected based on an estimate of their market value&#13;
given risk and profitability expectations and peer group and market indices.&#13;
Interest       A useful guideline is that loans should be classified as "nonperforming" if no payment is made or the payment&#13;
Accrual        made (both principal and interest is any amount less than the contractual payment for the payment period. Interest&#13;
on non-performing commercial loans should not accrue for more than 90 days and at the end of 90 days such&#13;
accrued interest should be reversed. Interest on non-performing mortgage- loans should accrue for more than 180&#13;
days and at the end of that period such accrued interest should be reversed. Interest on overdrafts should&#13;
automatically accrue by increasing the amount outstanding. Once the overdraft is classified as substandard, interest&#13;
should cease to accrue previously accrued interest should be reversed. Accrued, uncollected interest should be&#13;
reflected as a separate account on the balance sheet.&#13;
Loan           The aggregate sum of loans to "borrower groups related to a financial institution" should be examined. A rule of&#13;
Concentration   thumb is that together they should represent no more than the total capital of the institution.&#13;
Requirements   Loans to Directors and Shareholders should be subject to more restrictive size limitations as for other borrowers&#13;
(including limits on loans to Borrowers or Borrower Groups Related to the Financial Institution).&#13;
Risks of unsecured loans in relation to the capital base should be noted.&#13;
Sectoral risk concentration should be evaluated in relation to the capital base of PFI.&#13;
Treatment of   The size and valuation of Fixed Assets and Assets Seized from Defaulting Debtors should be reviewed and an&#13;
Fixed Assets   assessment be made as to whether the valuation is appropriate (and the effects on capital) and whether too large of&#13;
an investment in fixed assets represents inordinate risk to the institution.&#13;
&#13;

ZIMBABWE&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
1.           Introduction and Administrative Arrangements. The objective of the Institutional&#13;
Development Component is to support the development of public and private institutions which form an&#13;
integral part of the framework for enterprise development supported by other measures under the Project.&#13;
Improving the capacity of these institutions will prove vital to further facilitating policy reforms being&#13;
undertaken (improving the application of duty relief mechanisms for exporters, Export Processing Zone&#13;
(EPZ) schemes, and improving banking supervision) and in supporting private institutions in achieving a&#13;
supply response to measures undertaken. The component would be administered by the project's&#13;
Administrative Secretariat as indicated in Annex E.&#13;
I. Matching Grants for Strengthening the Capacity of Financial Intermediaries&#13;
2.            Rationale. To date, each commercial bank in Zimbabwe has a Small Business Unit&#13;
whose objective is to lend to small emerging enterprises.  Moreover, select non-bank financial&#13;
institutions have embarked on lending to this segment. In most cases, an effort has been made to develop&#13;
the capacity to lend to emerging enterprises on a profitable and sustainable basis. Yet the managers of&#13;
these financial institutions have admitted that there are significant limitations in the staff capability and&#13;
operating systems to originate, appraise, supervise and monitor SME loans in their institutions.&#13;
Moreover, banks and non-banks have indicated a need and willingness to view alternative methods for&#13;
loan origination, appraisal, monitoring and supervision. The matching grant scheme is developed in&#13;
recognition of the additional costs incurred by financial intermediaries (Fls) in undertaking or enhancing a&#13;
new line of activity in terms of developing skilled staffing for SME operations and in terms of developing&#13;
the necessary systems for monitoring and supervision of SME clients. The aim is that financial institutions&#13;
can partially defray additional market entry costs to accelerate their movement in this area.&#13;
3.            Program. As indicated in Table Cl below, a 50:50 Matching Grant Program  (Project&#13;
Cost US$840,000 of which IDA would finance US$420,000) would be established to assist financial&#13;
institutions in developing the capacity and systems necessary for SME loan initiation, appraisal and&#13;
monitoring. This scheme aims to mitigate some of the costs incurred by financial intermediaries in&#13;
undertaking or enhancing this new line of activity. PFIs would have access to grant funds on a 50:50 basis&#13;
to partially defray these additional market entry costs in order to accelerate their movement in this area.&#13;
The total expected IDA support of US$420,000 would represent 14 matching grants of an average of&#13;
US$30,000 over a three-year period. Matching grants would be targeted at supporting the Small&#13;
Business Units of commercial banks. In order to receive such a grant, the financial institution must&#13;
submit a development program which should indicate precisely the type of expert advice or training&#13;
proposed. This could include the number of activities (workshops, on the job training, site visits, courses&#13;
attended) to be concluded, number of staff trained per activity, level of staff trained, type of training&#13;
conducted, sources of trainers, estimated cost per training event, estimated cost per staff training event,&#13;
and expected results. Matching grants could also be applied towards the development of internal systems&#13;
and controls of SME lending activity, such as the development of a separate cost account and loan&#13;
portfolio monitoring system for the Small Business Unit or SME portfolio. It is likely that institutional&#13;
development needs will be concentrated in the following areas: (i) internal staff training; (ii) twinning/&#13;
partnering with "best practice" financial intermediaries abroad; (iii) specialized consultancies&#13;
&#13;

of training conducted, sources of trainers, estimated training events, and expected results. Further, the&#13;
use of specialized consultants for training or systems development would need to be justified through the&#13;
submission to the Administrative Secretariat. Finally, matching grants applied towards the development&#13;
of internal systems and controls of SME lending activity, such as the development of a separate cost&#13;
account and loan portfolio monitoring system for the SBU unit or SME portfolio would need to be&#13;
justified by the submission of a similar plan.&#13;
II. Support of SEDCO in Sharpening its Financial Administration and Strategic Focus&#13;
5.           Background. SEDCO's overall results in supporting emerging enterprises has been&#13;
positive in the years since its founding in 1983. The institution has developed demonstrated institutional&#13;
capacity in lending to SMEs and has reached an important segment of existing companies. Although its&#13;
borrower performance was adversely affected by the 1992 drought and its aftermath, SEDCO's&#13;
performance when viewed from the perspective of sustainable enterprises supported, appears positive. In&#13;
the past, SEDCO has experienced understaffing and staff turnover problems resulting from salaries not&#13;
sufficiently competitive. In spite of the status of SEDCO as a parastatal and the presence of civil&#13;
servants on the Board, SEDCO management operates independently and autonomously. Management&#13;
support had also been provided for a number of years through a CIDA-funded program. Through several&#13;
advisors, this support has built up SEDCO's capacity in operations, client assistance and financial&#13;
monitoring. Access to financial resources has been constrained for SEDCO since its establishment,&#13;
given that SEDCO has been and still is dependent on Govemment's budgetary allocations to cover its&#13;
operating expenses.  Slow  Government disbursements have also created cash-flow  constraints.&#13;
Moreover, since the 1992 drought, losses in its loan portfolio have significantly reduced its net lending.&#13;
6.           SEDCO defines its clientele as those enterprises with fewer than 50 employees and less&#13;
than US$60,000 in assets. Seventy percent of its loans are in rural areas. SEDCO recently initiated a&#13;
one-year pilot scheme in micro-finance using a group-lending methodology. These loans have a 12&#13;
month term and monthly repayments and its cost of capital is under 10%. Enterprises must come up with&#13;
15% of the overall project. SEDCO has also placed considerable emphasis on client training in order to&#13;
support the growth of SMEs, providing training and technical assistance for its clients, and non-clients&#13;
on a fee basis. For most clients, the first training/ technical assistance provided is in the form of&#13;
assistance to prepare loan submission, including, in effect, the business plan (e.g., projections, evaluation&#13;
of markets). This process frequently requires a significant investment in time by SEDCO staff. This&#13;
cost has been frequently cited by commercial banks as a serious constraint in their lending to SSEs.&#13;
Clients are encouraged, and frequently required, to participate in one or more of the courses that SEDCO&#13;
offers in the core areas of business. With the assistance and financial support of CIDA, SEDCO has&#13;
developed an Entrepreneur Development Program to assist a pre-screened group to develop business&#13;
proposals.&#13;
7.           SEDCO has developed a fairly detailed screening process with loan origination,&#13;
approval, monitoring and recovery capacity located in-house. The project review process includes: (i) a&#13;
review of the current and projected financial position of the prospective borrowers; (ii) a market&#13;
competition analysis; (iii) a review of labor and management issues; and (iv) site visits. After some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                                   AnnexC&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
time, SEDCO succeeded in implementing a solid computer monitoring system to manage the flow of&#13;
information and track clients in arrears. Currently, the institution has six branch offices all located in&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
8.            SEDCO has a capital base of about US$450,000 and an outstanding loan portfolio of&#13;
about US$4.5 million. As of March 1995, SEDCO had a capital base of about US$750,000, 1,900 loans&#13;
outstanding, and a portfolio valued at about US$17.9 million. Its average loan size used to be under&#13;
US$10,000 but in recent years, SEDCO has increased that amount in an effort to provide support to&#13;
larger SMEs, many of which who have a credit history with SEDCO. A maximum size has been set at&#13;
US$120,000. Most of SEDCO's loans to date have been medium term loans, as 77% of all loans and&#13;
79% of the value of all loans have been granted on a three to five year basis.&#13;
9.            Strategic Plan. Prior to undertaking a program of strengthening SEDCO's financial&#13;
administration and strategic focus it is important to have a clear idea of the strategic objectives of&#13;
SEDCO's Board and management. It is therefore important to answer the following questions prior to&#13;
proceeding to make commitments under this component as well as before potentially certifying SEDCO&#13;
to intermediate funds under the Finance Component of the Project. Such a strategic plan should, at a&#13;
minimum, indicate: (i) which segments of the market SEDCO is targeting in terms of size, sector and&#13;
process, including ascertaining its objectives in microenterprise lending; (ii) more clearly define its&#13;
interest rate policy, with clearer criteria for market adjustments; (iii) explain its funding and treasury&#13;
strategy, including realistic expectations of Government financing and the objectives and expectations in&#13;
inviting in non-governmental shareholders; (iv) develop reasonable multi-year solvency targets which&#13;
the institution could then work towards bearing in mind its strategic objectives; and (v) articulate targets&#13;
for operating efficiency (operating costs as a percentage of loans outstanding), bearing in mind SEDCO's&#13;
objectives to assistance services to its clients. Receipt of such a strategic plan, acceptable to IDA would&#13;
be a condition of disbursing funds under this subcomponent.&#13;
10.           Program. Support under the Project would be provided to improve SEDCO's strategic&#13;
focus and its financial management. The project would provide US$170,000 of support for SEDCO as&#13;
follows: Assistance by a firm specialized in financial institution management strategy would be&#13;
contracted by SEDCO to provide guidance in: (i) refining its strategic target borrower segments in terms&#13;
of the competitive advantage the institution has to offer; and (ii) setting up a financial strategy so as to&#13;
maximize its funding and diversify its funding base; and (iii) review with SEDCO management issues of&#13;
strategic and financial planning including, the implications of interest rate policy for capital&#13;
accumulation and thus, levels of net lending and the strategic positioning of SEDCO in the SME, SSE&#13;
and microenterprise markets. Further, a trained Financial Specialist would be contracted to provide&#13;
assistance including: (i) training offinancial division staff in projections and financial planning, treasury&#13;
management and cost of funds assessment, calculation of financial risks; and portfolio appraisal; and (ii)&#13;
training of business analysts in loan appraisal and project risk assessment. Assistance by a legal&#13;
specialist would be provided including: (i) training of Legal Desk Officers in legal procedures, including&#13;
loan liquidation's; (ii) training of Business Analysts in the legal aspects of registry/titling and recovery of&#13;
fixed and movable collateral; and (iii) training of Debt Recovery Unit Officers in the legal aspects and&#13;
procedures of collateral seizure and appropriation, including assessing client's worthiness of legal&#13;
action. The project would also provide for the acquisition of six desk-top computers, two printers and&#13;
select software to add to and replace SEDCO's aging computer systems.&#13;
III. Support to Strengthening RBZ Financial Institution Regulation and Supervision&#13;
11.           Rationale. Under current law, the RBZ has the authority to issue statutory prudential&#13;
regulations for banking institutions, but has no authority to carry out on-site inspections, and limited&#13;
authority to require information for surveillance purposes. The main statutory requirements for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                                  4nnexzC&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
banking system cover minimum capital and reserves and minimum liquidity balances. Operational&#13;
guidelines include gearing ratios, overall risk asset ratios, maximum exposure in any one customer or&#13;
related groups of customers, and monitoring of foreign exchange dealings.&#13;
12.          Financial liberalization, the increasing size and complexity of the financial system and&#13;
pending modifications to banking legislation have resulted in significant increases in the responsibilities&#13;
placed on RBZ for financial institution supervision. The draft revised Banking Act would amend current&#13;
legislation such that the regulatory authority and enforcement powers of the Banking Supervision&#13;
Department (BSD) in the RBZ would further increase significantly. The new Act would enable the RBZ&#13;
to perform on-site examinations and would widen its coverage to include finance houses and building&#13;
societies. Further, current prudential banking guidelines would be transformed into regulations and new&#13;
regulations would be drafted and implemented.&#13;
13.          Program. In light of this pressing need for strengthened regulation and institutional&#13;
capacity to implement such regulations, the project would provide US$200,000 of support for the&#13;
institutional strengthening of the RBZ in its expanded role of regulation and supervision of financial&#13;
institutions. Project funds would support the institutional strengthening of the RBZ in its regulation and&#13;
supervision of financial institutions by financing extemal consultants in providing hands-on guidance&#13;
and training in on-site inspection procedures and practices. Consultants would work closely with RBZ&#13;
staff in conducting on-site inspections. Moreover, support would be provided in off-site analysis,&#13;
including the application of eligibility criteria established. Finally, assistance would be provided in the&#13;
development of implementing regulations and circulars to complement the revised Banking Act.&#13;
Specific consultant support would be provided for: (i) drafting and implementation of prudential banking&#13;
regulations, including loan classification, provisioning and capital requirements under the revised Banking&#13;
Act; (ii) assistance with the development of manuals for on-site and off-site bank examinations; (iii)&#13;
practical assistance with on-the job on-site and off-site examinations (for instance from a foreign bank&#13;
regulator); (iv) strengthening financial institutions' reporting to BSD and BSD's data analysis capacity;&#13;
and (v) six laptop computers, four portable printers and select software for the BSD, in particular for use&#13;
in on-site inspection and analysis.&#13;
IV. Support of the RBZ in Developing an Apex Unit and Credit Guarantee Agency&#13;
14.          Rationale. The responsibilities taken on by the RBZ to manage the project's Apex and&#13;
Credit Guarantee Agency (CGA) involve significant institutional development requirements and start-up&#13;
needs. Development of an efficient Apex will require considerable institution-building so as to assure&#13;
that the Finance Component functions efficiently. Further, efficient management of a CGA will prove&#13;
critical to the success of the project.&#13;
15.          Program. The project would provide US$70,000 of support to the RBZ in developing&#13;
an Apex Unit and CGA. This would include:&#13;
*  Development of Regulations and Procedures Manuals for the SME and Export Finance Facilities.&#13;
Two consultant specialists would provide assistance in the development of the SME Finance Facility&#13;
and the Export Finance facilities, respectively.  These manual will outline each step in the&#13;
management of these finance facilities and will include each form of documentation required such as&#13;
participation agreements, sub-loan data sheets, disbursement forms and guarantee documentation;&#13;
*  Development of a Credit Guarantee Procedures Manual. Given that SME Credit guarantees and&#13;
Preshipment Export Finance guarantees are considerably different from oneanother, specialized&#13;
advice would be provided to the CGA under the project in putting together the procedures for these&#13;
facilities. Initial guidance would be provided by the individuals supporting the establishment of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                                  AnnexC&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
Apex which would then be complemented with one or more individuals with specific experience in&#13;
SME and Export Finance guarantees. Much of the work of this individual(s) would be to refine the&#13;
operational procedures for guarantee execution.&#13;
Systems Development - Subproject Information Management and Disbursement System.  A&#13;
consultant would be hired under the project to assist Apex management in setting up an automated&#13;
operating system for the management of the finance facilities, based on the finance facilities&#13;
regulations manuals. In addition, the consultant will provide hands-on guidance to the Apex staff.&#13;
Time permitting, the same consultant will be called upon to provide the same kind of operating&#13;
system design for the CGA, including initial staff training. Funds would also be provided for the&#13;
purchase of desktop computers and printers for the Apex and CGA.&#13;
V. Support of the Customs and Excise Department in its Automation and Administration of Duty-&#13;
Drawback and Inward Processing Rebate Provisions&#13;
A. Background and Objectives&#13;
16.          Background and Rationale. The Govemment has to date taken far-reaching measures&#13;
to improve the incentive framework for emerging exporters, including liberalization of access to foreign&#13;
exchange and a reduction of duties on inputs. Yet anti-export biases remain, in part because of the&#13;
difficulty in administration of existing mechanisms for providing input duty relief for exporters.&#13;
Assuring speedy access to imported inputs at world market prices is critical for emerging SME and infant&#13;
direct and indirect exporter to compete in the world market on an equal footing with foreign competitors.&#13;
Offering efficient duty-free import schemes is the best export incentives that the Govemment can offer to&#13;
emerging exporters without violating GATT rules on export subsidies as well as incurring budgetary&#13;
burdens.&#13;
17.          Automation. The current Central and Regional Customs and Excise Department has&#13;
had very limited automation of duty assessments nor automation of the process of data centralization.&#13;
Although a process is going on, further installation of desk-top computers in Regional Customs offices as&#13;
well as use by Customs Officers of transportable laptops could significantly increase the efficiency of&#13;
duty assessment and collection. Moreover, it could increase the efficiency of determining duty drawback&#13;
and inward processing rebate eligibility. The aim is to achieve more liberalized Inward Processing&#13;
Rebate permits authorization' as well as more speedy access to Duty Drawbacks (currently 7 to 8 months&#13;
delays in receiving drawbacks). Greater transparency in these schemes will prove critical for ensuring&#13;
the equal access for the schemes for SME, infant, or indirect exporters.&#13;
18.          Standard Input-Output Coefficients. Published standard input-output coefficients are&#13;
a means by which direct and indirect producers are given a clear idea beforehand of the amount of duty&#13;
they can expect to pay on inputs that go into their products as well as a clear idea of the amount of rebate&#13;
or other exemption they are entitled to. The use and publication of such coefficients would not&#13;
fundamentally alter the process of duty assessment today but would merely increase the transparency and&#13;
efficiency of such calculations. Publication of standard input-output coefficients and computerization of&#13;
IPR and Duty Drawback handling at the Regional Customs would make it possible for exporters to deal&#13;
exclusively with the Regional Customs for IPR and Duty Drawback, eliminating their trips to and the&#13;
duplicated administrative work of the main Customs office. In tum, cross-county experiences suggest&#13;
that the costs of pre-tabulating the standard input-output coefficients are much less than the Customs&#13;
I     At this writing, only 41 exporters are allowed to use IPR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                                  Annex&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
manpower and exporters' administrative costs incurred in handling the input-output coefficients on an ad&#13;
hoc, non-systematic, and non-transparent way.&#13;
19.          Common Bonded Manufacturing Warehouse Scheme. In order to provide access to&#13;
duty exemption benefits (IPR-type benefits) for SMEs, infant, or indirect exporters, a Common Bonded&#13;
Manufacturing Warehouse Scheme would be offered. Duty exemption would relieve SME or infant&#13;
exporters from the high interest and working capital burdens associated with Duty Drawback. The&#13;
licensed Common Bonded Manufacturing Warehouse operators would be allowed to hold the stocks of&#13;
the duty-free imported items (under Custom bonds) for distribution to SME, infant, or indirect exporters&#13;
based on the published standard input-output coefficients and direct and indirect export orders at&#13;
reasonable service charges that would include import and Custom agent fees. The license would be&#13;
granted to private or public agencies.  Upon the submission of the required export completion&#13;
documents, the associated Custom Bonds would be released.&#13;
B. Program Support&#13;
20.          The program is aimed to achieve four objectives: (i) develop an efficient and transparent&#13;
system of Input-Output Coefficient Administration; (ii) improve the efficiency of Inward Processing&#13;
Rebate and Duty Drawback relief provisions; (iii) establish and implement a mechanism for duty relief&#13;
by indirect producers by a Common-bonded Manufacturers' Warehouse scheme; and (iv) further&#13;
automate the process of duty calculation and processing. This support will be closely coordinated with&#13;
the support of the EPZ Authority indicated in Section VI below. The Project will provide US$300,000 in&#13;
funding to support achieving these objectives.&#13;
21.          Standard Input-Output Coefficients. The project would support a Team Leader and&#13;
three foreign input-output coefficient experts for the estimation of the standard input-output coefficients&#13;
of the major manufactured export items. These coefficients (known as "formulae" or "ratings") would be&#13;
pre-tabulated for key manufacturing export items (at the disaggregated H.C. level) by qualified sub-&#13;
sector engineering staff. This exercise would be carried out in an office separated from the Regional and&#13;
Main Custom units implementing the IPR and Duty Drawback on a daily basis and publish the standard&#13;
input-output coefficients for the daily use by exporters and Customs officials. An administrative&#13;
mechanism could be established in the medium-term by which an input-output coefficient office could&#13;
issue new or revised standard input-output coefficients for new export items or items that need revisions&#13;
shortly after receiving exporters' requests.  These individuals would have specializations in the&#13;
textile/garment, leather/footwear, and engineering/other sectors.  They would be supported for&#13;
approximately 40 working days each. Additional tasks of these experts would be to estimate a fixed&#13;
drawback schedule for those outputs with complex and a large number of inputs such as electronics&#13;
goods, and train the staff of the input-output coefficient office so that they can carry out the tasks of&#13;
updating the standard input-output coefficients. In addition, the project would finance five desktop&#13;
Pentium computers and two printers to carry out the tasks of estimating, publishing, and updating the&#13;
standard input-output coefficients and fixed drawback schedule.&#13;
22.          Systems Support. Assistance of one computer system expert would be needed for&#13;
approximately 30 working days (two three-week sessions) for the development of a computer program to&#13;
be used in the Regional Customs for the speedy administration of IPR, Duty Drawback and Common&#13;
Bonded Manufacturing Warehouse schemes based on standard input-output coefficients and other import&#13;
and export documents. Two desktop computers in each regional Customs office would also be supported&#13;
under the project and five desktop Pentium computers and two printers to carry out the tasks of&#13;
estimating, publishing, and updating the standard input-output coefficients and duty drawback schedules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                                  AnnexGC&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
23.          Study Tour. The project would support the participation of two individuals from the&#13;
Customs and Excise Department in the EPZ study tour referred to in the paragraphs below. The purpose&#13;
of this exercise is to acquaint these officials with the "best practices" in other notable countries where&#13;
anti-export biases in the Customs regime have been reduced and thus exports flourished but where the&#13;
integrity of customs duty collections has remained.&#13;
VII. Support to the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZ)&#13;
24.          Rationale. An efficient Export Processing Zone can be key to expanded export growth&#13;
an employment generation. Critical to this is the preparation of EPZ Customs Regime implementation&#13;
guidelines. Unlike EPZ Acts in a number of developing countries that stipulate a special custom regime,&#13;
the EPZ Act -- 1994 does not have a special provision on the custom regime. The Customs and Excise&#13;
(General Amendment) Regulations, 1995 (No. 7) includes provisions on the custom regime for EPZs.&#13;
However, these provisions are general. Assurance of the best practice EPZ custom regime will therefore&#13;
likely depend on the actual implementation of these provisions by Customs officials. In order to be&#13;
successful in inducing foreign and domestic investors into the EPZs, it is necessary to let the potential&#13;
investors know the clearly spelled out customs regulations to be applied to the EPZs.&#13;
25.          Program. As a first step to prepare EPZ implementation regulations, the project would&#13;
support a study tour to review best practice EPZs such as the Dominican Republic EPZ. A team of staff&#13;
from both the Customs and Excise Department and the EPZ Authority would travel to a select number of&#13;
destinations for this purpose. Subsequently, in order to assist the preparation of the EPZ custom regime&#13;
implementation regulations, the assistance of an external consultant who is an expert in EPZ customs&#13;
regimes would provide support in drafting such regulations for a period of approximately 70 working&#13;
days. Support would also be provided for two desktop computers for the EPZ Authority.&#13;
VIII. Support of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce&#13;
26.          Rationale. In the last two years, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has taken on&#13;
an increasing active role in economic planning and in its role vis-a-vis multilateral institutions. Its&#13;
staffing complement has indeed been weakened during the same period. The aim of this support would&#13;
be to provide training and computer support to MOIC staff in fulfilling its new mandate. The focus of&#13;
this support would be to strengthen MOIC's private sector unit (in coordination with an existing&#13;
NORAD-funded program) and improve its capacity for the coordination and management of multilateral&#13;
and bilateral-supported programs.&#13;
27.          Program. The project would provide US$100,000 funding for a series of focused&#13;
training sessions for MOIC staff on financial management, procurement, strategic planning, and&#13;
coordination of multilateral and bilateral organizations. Two desktop computers would also be financed,&#13;
as well as one printer.&#13;
IX. Operation and Support of the Project Administrative Secretariat&#13;
28.          The Operation of the Project Administrative Secretariat is indicated as Annex E. The&#13;
financing of the Secretariat would be as follows: The MOIC would second two staff to operate this unit&#13;
as well as would provide external facilities for it to operate. Cofinancing would, in addition, provide&#13;
financing for an additional Technical Adviser who could assist the work of the Secretariat as well as unit&#13;
managers of the ZMGS and Matchmaker Facility. It is estimated that the cost of the Technical Adviser&#13;
would cost US$540,000 over three years, and half of this individual's time (and budget) would be&#13;
dedicated to providing oversight of Institutional Development components and half to support of the&#13;
Business Services Component.&#13;

Administrative Secretariat&#13;
ZIMBABWE&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Operations of the Administrative Secretariat&#13;
1.           Functions - General. The objectives of the Administrative Secretariat are to serve as an&#13;
administrative arm of the Steering Team and to coordinate and manage the functions of the Institutional&#13;
Development component.&#13;
2.           Administrative Arm  of the Steering Team  and Overall Project Management&#13;
Functions. As an administrative arm of the Steering Team, the Secretariat's functions would be to: (i)&#13;
prepare agenda and minutes of meetings of the Steering Team and the Technical Committee of the&#13;
Steering Team, as directed by Steering Team members. This could include transmitting Steering Team&#13;
approvals and decisions, and, carrying out other actions as directed; (ii) transmitting quarterly progress&#13;
reports to the Steering Team and IDA, based on data provided by the respective component or&#13;
subcomponent managers and, in the case of the Institutional Development component, also preparing&#13;
such reports; (iii) coordinating the contractual process by which the Steering Team hires subcomponent&#13;
managers under the project, in accordance with the procurement guidelines specified, including&#13;
submitting requests for "no objection" and accompanying documentation as needed to IDA; (iv)&#13;
overseeing the transmission of applications, audit reports, certifications and/or rejections to the Steering&#13;
Team from financial institutions seeking to participate under the project's Finance Facility. In the case&#13;
of financial institutions judged partially eligible, the Secretariat would be responsible for ensuring that&#13;
the Steering Team has received progress reports on compliance with targets established for&#13;
recertification; (v) coordinating annual project auditing requirements; and (vi) assisting IDA supervision&#13;
missions in coordination of the evaluation of each component.&#13;
3.           Administration of the Institutional Development Component.  Functions in the&#13;
administration of the Institutional Development Component would include: (i) administering the&#13;
matching grant program for financial institutions (including reviews of applications and carrying out&#13;
outreach); (ii) overseeing that measures supported in the Customs and Excise Department and EPZ&#13;
Authority are carried out in accordance with parameters established in the SAR and Project&#13;
Implementation Plan; (iii) reviewing progress in the development program for SEDCO in relationship to&#13;
financing provided; (iv) preparing a quarterly budgetary reconciliation and progress reports for the&#13;
Steering Team and IDA on the level of commitments, disbursements and progress in reaching objectives&#13;
under each of the Institutional Development subcomponents; and (v) coordinating the contractual process&#13;
for services and goods contracted under the Institutional Development component, including submitting&#13;
requests for "no objection" and accompanying documentation as needed to IDA.&#13;
4.           Composition and Appointment. The Secretariat would be comprised by a Unit Head&#13;
and two assistants. The Unit Head and one assistant would be identified by the Ministry of Industry and&#13;
Commerce, subject to the no-objection of IDA. The Ministry would also supply the Secretariat with&#13;
office space, equipment and support to carry out its mandate. Both staff of the Unit would report to the&#13;
Steering Team.&#13;
5.           It is expected that the third individual, a Technical Adviser would provide part-time&#13;
assistance to the Secretariat (serving as one of the assistants) in addition to advisory roles under the&#13;
Business Services component. Such a Technical Adviser would be financed under the project.&#13;

aL   All ICB procurement documents and arrangements will be subject to prior review  by IDA.  Although the latter&#13;
requirement could be applied in the event of the modification of the size of subprojects, these requirements would not be&#13;
binding in the project's current form.&#13;
bL Procurement would be required according to local shopping procedures for any single contract totaling US$30,000 or less.&#13;
For each contract costing more than US$30,000, but less than US$100,000, procurement would be made by National&#13;
Competitive Bidding procedures (NCB). Contracts in excess of US$100,000 would be made in accordance with&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. All NCR and ICR procurement documents and arrangements would&#13;
be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;

Economic Analysis - Project Performance Indicators&#13;
1.             Many of this project's benefits are difficult to measure because the project supports the&#13;
acceleration of a process that leads to an outcome rather than a concrete outcome directly. Nevertheless,&#13;
the best estimate is that the project would generate a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$52 million at a&#13;
discount rate of 12 percent and an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 24.7%. This estimate is based on a&#13;
methodology whereby the project is assumed to accelerate an increase in output by three years. Such&#13;
an increase in output is therefore expected be realized without the project, albeit three years later.&#13;
Table J I below summarizes the quantitative results of the analysis undertaken, including ERR and NPV&#13;
calculations done on a subcomponent and on an aggregated basis. Chart JI indicates graphically the&#13;
effects in net increases in direct economic output by support provided under the project. A summary of&#13;
the principal assumptions is indicated below .&#13;

2.             Methodology. The methodology of the assessment was as follows:&#13;
*  For the Business Services component, matching grants for emerging exporters (ZMGS Matching&#13;
Grants) is expected to accelerate an increase in output for these firms of 10 times the amount of the&#13;
matching grant.  Although empirical data in other, primarily East-Asian countries, indicated&#13;
increases in output of at least 15 times, this analysis used more conservative assumptions (of 10&#13;
times). This expected increase in output was then reduced by two thirds. This reduction in net&#13;
benefits is based on an assumption of the level of resources expected to be diverted from other&#13;
economic activities to achieve this result. The process of providing matching grants for Business&#13;
Associations leads to a more indirect result. However, for purposes of consistency, a similar&#13;
methodology was applied, with an expectation of an accelerated increase in output in accordance&#13;
with the increase in membership and level of provision of services provided by associations. For the&#13;
Matchmaking Facility, given its similarity to ZMGS matching grants for purposes of economic&#13;
analysis, a similar accelerated increase in output was assumed -- ten times the level of support,&#13;
reduced by 2/3 as above.&#13;
The full tables indicating the precise results by component and subcomponent are available in the Project Files. The analysis of benefits&#13;
methodology is adapted from Levy. Berry and Nugent, "Successful SMEs and Their Support Systems," forthcoming, mimeo, 1996.&#13;

b/ Reduced by 2/3.&#13;
*   The Finance component is expected to accelerate an increase in output by SMEs and emerging&#13;
exporters by reducing the funding constraint and by reducing the level of risk through the guarantee&#13;
mechanism. Increases in output for SMEs were assumed to be equal to the amount of financing,&#13;
with a lag of 6 months after disbursement to realize the output results. This assumes that investment&#13;
and permnanent working capital financing yield a rapid increase in output. Inputs are assumed to&#13;
turnover twice per year and a five percent default rate per year is assumed. Increases in output of&#13;
emerging exporters were assumed to be the amount of export financing, based on an expectation of&#13;
turnover three times per year, with a similar five percent default rate per year. The estimated&#13;
increases in output for SMEs and emerging exporters was, as above, reduced by 2/3.&#13;
*   Measurement of the economic benefits of Institutional Development support is the most difficult,&#13;
because support only yields provision of services to firms indirectly. Nonetheless, for the purpose of&#13;
consistency, it was assumed that this support would accelerate an increase in output, staggered two&#13;
years after disbursements, equal to 1.5 times the level of support. In the case of matching grants for&#13;
PFIs (part of the Institutional Development Component), output by PFIs was assumed to increase by&#13;
five times the amount of the matching grant, also 2 years after disbursement.&#13;
3.              Results. The above analysis yielded a series of accelerated increases in output levels per&#13;
sub-component. The same scenarios were then repeated, albeit, staggered three years behind the first&#13;
analysis. This is based upon the assumption that the principal result is the acceleration of a process by&#13;
three years. As indicated in Table J2 and Chart JI below, the final economic results are represented by&#13;
the present value calculations of the difference between the first scenario of increases in output resulting&#13;
from the project and the same scenario, three years behind it. The results suggest that the overall project&#13;
can be strongly justified in NPV and ERR terms. The Business Services subcomponents had much&#13;
stronger projected rates of return (42%-51%) that the Finance subcomponents (13%-26%).  The&#13;
downside risks are borne out through sensitivity analysis below:&#13;
4.              Sensitivity Analysis.  As indicated in Table J3, Sensitivity Analysis was performed&#13;
yielding the following results:   First, given  the possibility  of more gradual disbursement and&#13;
implementation owing to macroeconomic circumstances and slow progress in developing the&#13;
implementing institutions, an analysis was made of a slower disbursement process. By elongating the&#13;
disbursement period from approximately 4 years for all components to approximately 6 years (finance&#13;
component) and business services and institutional development from 3 years to 5 years, the effect for&#13;
the project was to reduce the NPV from US$52.1 million to US$40.7 million and the ERR from 24.7% to&#13;
&#13;

economic impact of the project.&#13;

5.            The second evaluation was to modify the reduction in the level of output attributed to&#13;
diversion from other sources. In this case, by increasing the reduction from 66.7% (the base case) to&#13;
75%, the NPV remained still significantly positive ($13.1 million) and reducing the level of reduction to&#13;
50% increased the NPV quite significantly to US$130.1 million. Thus, although the outcomes are&#13;
sensitive to the effects of modifying this variable, all of the outcomes present positive NPVs within the&#13;
parameters (50%-75% reduction) established in the theoretical foundation for this approach.&#13;
6.            An evaluation was conducted of the Finance component, testing how changes in the&#13;
assumed rate of turnover of the firms financed would effect the economic results (using the evaluation of&#13;
the three year lag as per above). The base case assumes that, in the case of SMEs, turnover would be&#13;
twice per year (in accordance with company discussions), with output increasing at the level of&#13;
financing. In the case of emerging exporters, turnover is assumed to be three times per year, with output&#13;
increasing at the level of financing. In the case of SMEs, by reducing the assumed level of turnover from&#13;
two times per year to one time, the subcomponent resulted in a negative NPV. The break-even point was&#13;
1.93 times turnover per year. This suggests that the downside risk in these terms is relatively significant.&#13;
In undertaking the same analysis for exporters, the results are similar (given that the calculation is&#13;
similar). The base case assumes that, in the case of emerging exporters, turnover would be three times&#13;
per year (in accordance with company discussions), with output increasing at the level of financing. In&#13;
this case, the break-even point was a similar 1.92 cycles per year but even reducing the cycles to 2 per&#13;
year still yielded a positive NPV. This suggests that to the degree to which output is affected by the&#13;
ability of firms supported to increase production is the same for exporters as for SMEs, the downside risk&#13;
is less for exporters because the marginal increase in output is greater given the shorter production cycle.&#13;
7.            The evaluation of the Business Services Component was first examined changing the&#13;
expected increase in output of firms under the SBAI subcomponent as a function of support of business&#13;
associations. First, firms participating in associations supported by the program and firms joining these&#13;
associations under the base case were assumed to increase output by US$10,000. When this amount was&#13;
reduced to US$5,000, the NPV was reduced from US$4.7 million (42% ERR) to US$0.8 million (18%&#13;
ERR), with the break-even point (in terms of NPV) at US$4,000 per firm. This means that if&#13;
participating firms do not increase their output by US$4,000 over the period, the project will have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Economic Analysis - Project Performance Indicators&#13;
unsuccessful in the sense of yielding a 12% ERR. For the ZimTrade Matching Grant, the analysis&#13;
evaluated the impact of changing the expected increase in output for each firm from the base case of 10&#13;
(I$ of matching grant accelerates a US$10 increase in output). The results here were that the multiple&#13;
goes as low as 3.66 before the NPV would become negative. On the upside, an assumption of a multiple&#13;
of 15 (consistent with East Asian experience) yields an NPV of $22.4 million (ERR of 72%). Sensitivity&#13;
analysis for the Matchmaking Facility yielded a somewhat similar result. If output by affected firms&#13;
were to increase by five times the level of grants (as opposed to the base case of ten times), the NPV&#13;
becomes US$0.6 million (18% ERR). The break-even point is for output to increase 4.2 times the level&#13;
of grants. However, the upside potential indicates that if output increases 15 times the level of grants,&#13;
then the NPV rises to $7.8 million (ERR 68%). This suggests that the Matchmaking Facility could reach&#13;
less than half its output expectations and still be considered successful.&#13;
8.            The evaluation of the Institutional Development component first examined changing the&#13;
relationship between the level of support and the expected level of output. The base case assumed that&#13;
for each US$1 of support, output increased by a multiple of 1.5 times the support, albeit two years after&#13;
disbursement. Changing the ratio of increases in output to support from 1.5 to 1.0 resulted in a negative&#13;
NPV of US$ 100,000 (ERR I I%). The break-even point to reach the 12% ERR threshold is for output to&#13;
increase 1.1 times the level of support, two years after disbursement. Separately, an evaluation was done&#13;
of the PFI Matching Grant Facility. The base case assumed that output of PFIs would increase at a rate&#13;
five times the level of the matching grant, yielding an NPV of US$0.4 million (ERR 16%). The break-&#13;
even point for this subcomponent was found at the point where the increase in output is equal to 3.5&#13;
times the matching grant support. Thus even by very conservative assumptions, this subcomponent&#13;
seems to have a relatively low threshold to be considered successful in these terms.&#13;

Year&#13;
Main Assumptions&#13;
A. All Components&#13;
I. Increases in output are assumed to be accelerated by a period of three years. Such increases in&#13;
output are therefore e-xpected to have been realized without the project, albeit three years later.&#13;
2. Net Present Value and Economic Rate of Return calculations done based on the difference in&#13;
increases in output between two scenarios, with and without the project respectively.&#13;
3. The results of the differences in marginal output under the two scenarios is reduced by 67%. This&#13;
is based on the assumption that two-thirds of the increase in output is assumed to be attributed to&#13;
effects drawing away resources from other activities.&#13;
4. ERR and Net Present Value calculation done for a ten-year period, assuming the full project costs&#13;
are expended up-front2.&#13;
B. Business Services Component&#13;
1. SBAI. Assumes 17 subsector associations supported through development support and 36 through&#13;
matching grant support (US$10,000 in development support and US$30,000 in matching grants).&#13;
Assumes average association supported has 14 members, all of which increase by 2 members each&#13;
year. Assumes average firm in each association supported increases output by US$10,000 per year&#13;
attributable to membership in the association and support provided to the association. Increase in&#13;
output has a lag of six months after disbursement of SBAI matching grant.&#13;
2. ZimTrade Matching Grant Scheme. Assumes 60 firms supported through ZimTrade matching&#13;
grants (US$50,000 in matching grants for each firm). Assumes that the increase in exports is equal&#13;
to 10 times the level of the ZimTrade matching grant, with a lag of 6 months after matching grant&#13;
provided.&#13;
3. Matchmaking Facility. Assumes 40 matchmaker transactions supported over three years and&#13;
US$30,000 provided to each matchmaker. Assumes 90% of matchmaker transactions supported&#13;
2&#13;
If one were to calculate the project's costs over the entire disbursement periods, the Net Present Value and ERR calculations would&#13;
increase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Economic Analysis - Project Performance Indicators&#13;
result in export transactions and such transactions result in an average level of export transaction is&#13;
10 times the level of matchmaker support, with a lag of 6 months after matching grant provided.&#13;
C. Finance Component&#13;
1. Disbursements are assumed over a four year period: 20% year 1, 30% year 2, 30% year 3, and 20%&#13;
year 4. This is more rapid than the disbursement period given in Schedule A.&#13;
2. Output is assumed to increase at a rate equal to new disbursements, with a lag of 6 months. This&#13;
means that in the case of SME financing, investment and permnanent working capital costs are&#13;
assumed to result in an increase in output, with turnover twice per year. In the case of Export&#13;
financing, turnover is assumed to be three times per year. Increase in output was conservatively&#13;
assumed to be working capital costs. No additional output results were assumed from labor inputs&#13;
or profit.&#13;
3. Five percent of total output each year is assumed to be lost due to firms falling into arrears or&#13;
bankruptcy.&#13;
D. Institutional Development Component&#13;
I. Assumes that each type of institutional development support (with the exception of matching&#13;
grants for financial institutions) results in 1.5 times increase in output, accruing two years after&#13;
disbursement.&#13;
2. Assumes that matching grants for financial institutions results in an increase in output equal to the&#13;
level of the matching grant plus the institution's contribution times five, accruing two years after&#13;
disbursement.&#13;
3. Scenario calculated without project assumes same increases in output, albeit five years after&#13;
disbursement (three years after realizing such an effect under the project).&#13;
Nature of Benefits&#13;
* Acceleration of increase in output by emerging enterprises.&#13;
* Incremental employment generation by emerging enterprises.&#13;
* Improved financial sector efficiency in financing emerging enterprises.&#13;
* Increase in output and efficiency by established enterprises as specialization and provision of&#13;
services by emerging enterprises help established ones.&#13;
Main Beneficiaries&#13;
Approximately 500 Zimbabwean firms are estimated to benefit from SME financing and 350 firms&#13;
from Export financing. Approximately 53 associations and 900 firms are estimated to benefit from the&#13;
Subsector Business Associations Initiative, 60 firms from the ZimTrade Matching Grant program, and&#13;
40 from the Matchmaking Facility. The individual beneficiaries would thus be the principals and&#13;
employees of the firms affected. More generally, the financial markets will benefit as they improve&#13;
their efficiency as well the markets for business services.&#13;
Non-quantified Benefits&#13;
* Improved awareness of economic opportunities which does not directly result in increases in&#13;
output and employment by the firms supported.&#13;
* Secondary and tertiary effects of increases in output.&#13;
* Development of know-how put to use beyond the enterprises supported.&#13;
