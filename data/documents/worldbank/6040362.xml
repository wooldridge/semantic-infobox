            The demand for loans : governments
            restructure their debt
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            More than ever, governments in
            developing countries have access to capital markets, but
            most are not using it. Instead, they have restructured their
            debt portfolios, cutting the share of private sector debt
            and increasing the share of longer-term multilateral debt.
            While some argue that this increase in official debt is
            alarming, the evidence suggests that most governments are
            sensibly taking advantage of their menu of financing
            options&#151;extending maturities to lessen their vulnerability
            to the &#147;rollover risk&#148; posed by shorterterm debt and
            reducing their overall debt ratios.
