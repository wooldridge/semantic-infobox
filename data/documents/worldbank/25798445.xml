&amp;#12;The Economic Internet Toolkit for African Policy Makers was produced for the Africa&#13;
Internet Forum under the direction of Robert Schware, Senior Informatics Specialist in&#13;
the Telecommunications and Informatics Division of the World Bank. The models, data&#13;
and accompanying text were created by Charles Kenny; Anil Srivastava and Anat&#13;
Bernstein contributed to the section on examples of Internet use on the continent; and&#13;
Shampa Banerjee edited and prepared the document for publication. Our special thanks&#13;
and appreciation for major contributions made to the policy and global Internet sections&#13;
go to Robert Hawkins. We are very grateful for the help of Lane Smith (USAID), Inta&#13;
Brikovskis (NAS), Lee McKnight (MIT), Michael Jensen (UNIDO), Michel Menou&#13;
(CABECA), Nancy Hafkin (UNECA), John Mack (U.S. Department of State) and Raymond&#13;

program (ID 950920-10): infoDev is a grant-making program designed to encourage re-&#13;
form and investment for. improving access to information technology in&#13;

&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
&#13;
Liberalization of the telecommunications sector is progressing across Africa. One of the&#13;
most important benefits of this trend is that it will make value-added services, particu-&#13;
larly Internet access, more affordable and reliable for telecommunications users in the&#13;
continent.             '&#13;
      The Internet need not be a useful tool only for industrial societies. The poor in&#13;
many African countries, struggling to meet basic needs, often remain poor not only- be-&#13;
cause they are denied access to physical and human capital, but also because they lack&#13;
the information necessary to best convert that capital into wealth. By opening wide the&#13;
door to a huge store of global knowledge, the Internet offers untapped possibilities to&#13;
address the blight of information poverty. This Toolkit is inspired by the African experi-&#13;
ence where access to the World Wide Web is helping doctors to save patients, schools to&#13;
educate children, and communities to create businesses that will lift them out of destitu-&#13;
tion.&#13;
      Today there is growing exposure to the Internet in Africa. Over the last three years,&#13;
the number of Internet host sites, excluding the developed market of South Africa, has&#13;
risen twenty-fold. However, there are still many hurdles to a comprehensive coverage of&#13;
African nations. Issues that require urgent deliberation include pricing structures, mo- Â·&#13;
nopoly controls and licensing charges. Often these are a result of state policies restricted&#13;
by a short-term view of the economy and its future, or by concerns over the immediate&#13;
effect of the Internet on telephone company revenues.&#13;
      This Toolkit closely examines these issues. It finds that, in the long term, the&#13;
Internet cannot be looked upon as a threat to telecommunications companies. It is true&#13;
that it is one of a range of technological advances that are forcing changes i:ri. the opera-&#13;
tion of telecommunications systems, but it also presents opportunities for new sources&#13;
of revenues and new ways to meet the demands of society. The Internet has become a&#13;
tool for development, with its ability to facilitate the delivery of social services, disaster&#13;
mitigation, and poverty relief. The Toolkit also finds that the move toward liberalization&#13;
is likely to have a beneficial effect on Internet roll out, just as it has on basic service pro-&#13;
vision.&#13;
      The Toolkit is part of a collaborative effort on expanding Internet access in Africa&#13;
that began in 1995 with the creation of the Africa Internet Forum (AIF). This is a group&#13;
of donors, users and other interested organizations including the UNDP, UNITAR,&#13;
USAID, CIDA, NASA, the Carnegie Corporation and the African Networking Initiative&#13;
- which itself includes groups such as the IDRC, ITU, ECA and UNESCO. The Toolkit is&#13;
intended to be used in policy dialogues and country assessments, broadly to facilitate&#13;
the involvement of the private sector in Internet provision, and specifically to help&#13;
policy makers shape their attitudes toward this exciting and expanding sector of the&#13;
telecommunications business.&#13;

&#13;
                                             Further growth of the Internet in Africa is closely tied to the&#13;
                                             quality and availability of telecommunications infrastructure in&#13;

                                             begun reform programs in telecommunications. However, how&#13;

                                             vice providers need cheap and reliable access to international&#13;
                                             communications lines to link with the web, as well as equally&#13;
                                             reliable local access for their customers. This need for high band-&#13;

                                             true of most African nations, which have only two percent of&#13;

                                             countries like Rwanda and Botswana, others, like Madagascar&#13;

                                             such as ISDN, mobile telephony and leased lines are still not&#13;
                                             fully developed in most African countries. Despite this, Africa&#13;
                                             has a great opportunity to leapfrog such constraints by using&#13;

\   Models presented in this toolkit suggest that expansion of the&#13;
&#13;
I   Internet in Africa cah provide opportunities for significant re-&#13;
    duction in the communications cost of a wide range of African&#13;
    telecommunications users. These savings would come almost&#13;
    exclusively from international calls. There are two reasons for&#13;
    this conclusion. First, at the moment, 80 to 90 percent of email&#13;
    are sent to and received from outside of the continent. Second,&#13;
    international calls from and to the continent attract revenues far&#13;
    in excess of the costs of completing the call.&#13;
         Ironically, given the pressures on rate rebalancing which&#13;
    are unconnected with the Internet, it is likely that emailing will&#13;
    become relatively less attractive as a substitute for voice or fax&#13;
    as international call costs drop and local call costs increase. At&#13;
    the moment, however, Internet access is a profitable investment,&#13;
    purely from the point of view of direct savings on&#13;
    communications for companies that do a lot of international&#13;
    business. Talking to the United Kingdom for about an hour each&#13;
    business day over the period of a year would cost a Mozambican&#13;
    businessman approximately US$38,250. Faxing that same&#13;
    information would cost US$7,650. All of the yearly costs of a&#13;
    regional Internet connection - a computer, a modem, and&#13;
    Internet access - used for international email alone as a&#13;
    substitute for fax traffic, would together amount to US$1,328.&#13;
    The yearly savings over fax use would thus be US$6,322.&#13;

&amp;#12;costs) to South African levels. This increase, however, depends&#13;
on these sites being accessible to a paying public. While the&#13;
private sector will likely compete for users in the urban areas,&#13;
there will be an increased role for government to insure access&#13;
to those users in rural areas. Unless Internet sites proliferate in&#13;
community centers, libraries, schools, and telecenters, access will&#13;
be restricted to a small urban elite.&#13;
     While financial considerations are clearly central, results&#13;
from a survey of Internet usage in Africa point to other impor-&#13;
tant factors in spreading the technology to a larger number of&#13;
people. First, usage was severely restricted by a lack of knowl-&#13;
edge and adequate training. Further, even those with the skill&#13;
to access the technology were discouraged by the paucity of rel-&#13;
evant content and the unreliability of the network connections.&#13;
&#13;
Policy conclusions&#13;
&#13;
The Internet is likely to continue to revolutionize the means in&#13;
which people communicate and access information. Because the&#13;
Internet represents such a- powerful new communication tool,&#13;
the environment in which it operates must be regulated differ-&#13;
ently from traditional information and communication media.&#13;
The toolkit stresses three general principles: the importance of&#13;
not trying to fit the Internet into existing regulatory structures,&#13;
the power of competition on Internet growth, and the necessity&#13;
of allowing the Internet to flourish without the burden of un-&#13;
necessary regulation.&#13;
     The models and data presented in the toolkit suggest a num-&#13;
ber of policy conclusions. To expand access and use of the Inter-&#13;
net in Africa, it is necessary to provide the following:&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Low cost and reliable access to international band-&#13;
            width.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Low cost and reliable local bandwidth connectivity.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Countrywide reliable local cost access to ISPs.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Low cost access to network equipment.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Widespread public access to networked computers.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ An educated and trained user and provider base .&#13;
       . â&#128;¢ Support for the development of national and Afri-&#13;
            can Internet content.&#13;
     The policies that may help to meet these needs are:&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Liberalization of the telecommunications network.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Liberalization of Internet service provision.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Lowering of tariffs on computer and telecommuni-&#13;
            cations equipment.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ General tariff rebalancing with possible support for&#13;
            local cost ISP access.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Support for community access to the Internet.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Support for training in the use of the Internet.&#13;
                                                                      7&#13;

                                                  The Internet represents a new opportunity for increased&#13;
                                             knowledge and information for development. In the long term,&#13;
                                             it will significantly alter the structure of telecommunications.&#13;
                                             In the short term, the main policy conclusions from this toolkit&#13;
                                             are not very different from those of studies that concentrate on&#13;
                                             telecommunications in general. The Internet is heavily depen-&#13;
                                             dent on an efficient telecommunications sector, which is usually&#13;
                                             market-based. The Internet is itself another pressure acting to-&#13;
                                             ward the market option of further competition and liberaliza-&#13;
                                             tion. However, while the market forces will expand access to a&#13;
                                             section of the population, there will still remain a role for gov-&#13;

&amp;#12;2              Global Telecommunications,&#13;
               Emergence of the Internet,&#13;
               and Africa&#13;
&#13;
Not long ago, there were less than 200 telephone companies in&#13;
the world. Now there are perhaps 5,000 companies, and soon&#13;
there might be 100,000. Technological advances across the world&#13;
are making it difficult for monopolies to survive. This changing&#13;
environment is having diverse effects on the international tele-&#13;
communications system - not least on the costs and prices of&#13;
international phone calls (see box).&#13;
     International calls account for a large percentage of Afri-&#13;
can post and telecommunications (PTT) profits, and these prof-&#13;
its have been artificially maintained by agreements between&#13;
governments and the big national telephone companies. Chang-&#13;
ing technology and global policy reforms are now threatening&#13;
this arrangement, most visibly though the combined pressures&#13;
of accounting rates reform and call back services. This is only&#13;
the beginning, for there are other factors waiting to transform&#13;
the old telecommunications paradigm.&#13;
      Technological advances have also ushered in changes in&#13;
the economics of local supply (see box). Wireless local loop tech-&#13;
nology, for example, eliminates the need to run cables to every&#13;
home, by operating a short-distance wireless link that greatly&#13;

reduces the cost of connection. Such changes suggest that parts&#13;
of Africa might soon see local competition. In fact, in countries&#13;
that have opened up the telecommunications sector to a secondÂ·&#13;
network operator (SNO), the new entrant has frequently insti-&#13;
tuted wireless technology as the solution. Unfortunately, there&#13;
are many countries in Africa where liberalization attempts are&#13;
not keeping pace with technological change, as Table 2.1 amply&#13;
illustrates.&#13;
      While the global telecommunications sector has already&#13;
undergone significant changes, the technology of the Internet is&#13;
likely to add to both the rate and the scale of change. The Internet&#13;
is doubling in size each year. While Africa remains the least&#13;
connected continent on the globe (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3), it is&#13;
still likely to be affected by changes in global communications&#13;
systems brought about by the new technology - especially if&#13;
African nations embrace and encourage Internet development.&#13;

     The explosion of international bandwidth shows no signs&#13;
of slowing down. In 1994, George Gilder predicted in his "Gild-&#13;
ers Law" (Gilder, 1993) that the capacity of communications sys-&#13;
tems, the global bandwidth, will triple every 18 months. This&#13;
increase represents just one force that will continue to drive&#13;
down the price of communications.&#13;
&#13;
Technological changes that shape telecommunications&#13;
&#13;
This expansion of Internet traffic is partially driven by underly-&#13;
ing technological changes that threaten to further alter the shape&#13;
of the telecommunications industry. These forces include con-&#13;
vergence through digitalization, packet-switched networks, and&#13;
the standardization of the TCP /IP protocol.&#13;

                                                    smaller than increased revenues provided by the rapid rise in&#13;

                                                    Second, if the Internet poses a threat to telecommunications prof-&#13;

                                                    PTT revenues. Third, the cost of international service provision&#13;
                                                    is a fraction of the charges the PTTs demand for it. Email substi-&#13;

&amp;#12;      If African PTTs give way to pressures for rate rebalancing&#13;
 (charging less for international calls and more for a local con-&#13;
 nection and calls), this is likely to have a significant impact on&#13;
 the economics of the Internet in the continent, making email sub-&#13;
 stitution both less attractive to users and less of a threat to the&#13;
 region's telephone companies. More significantly, however, it&#13;
 might drive up the revenues that PTTs receive from World Wide&#13;
 Web users, which could turn Internet usage from a revenue drain&#13;

                                             Who uses the Internet iri Africa?&#13;
&#13;
                                             The CABECA survey of African Internet users was carried out&#13;
                                             in 1997-98 to gather data on the characteristics of the average&#13;
                                             African Internet user (see Bibliography for full citation). The&#13;
                                             survey found that there was as yet little government use of the&#13;
                                             Internet: only one percent of users in Ethiopia, and only six per-&#13;
                                             cent in Zambia, were government employees. The highest num-&#13;
                                             ber of users belonged to nongovernment organizations (NGOs ),&#13;
                                             private companies, and universities. The ratio of nationals to&#13;
                                             non-nationals varied between countries: 44 percent of users sur-&#13;

                                             Ghana. Most users were male: 86 percent, 83 percent, and 64&#13;
                                             percent in Ethiopia, Senegal, and Zambia respectively. A large&#13;

                                             bia and 98 percent in Ethiopia had a university degree. A recent&#13;
                                             South African survey of the Internet found similar results: the&#13;
                                             average user was male, 26 to 30, spoke English, was high school&#13;
                                             or university-educated, earned between US$24,000 and&#13;
                                             US$45,000 per year and worked in the computer industry.&#13;
&#13;
                                             What is the Internet used for?&#13;
&#13;
                                             The survey findings suggest that the average level of email use&#13;
                                             is one per day, sending and receiving. Email is used for general&#13;
                                             correspondence and document exchange, technical advice,&#13;
                                             managing projects, arranging meetings, and exchanging research&#13;
                                             ideas, although its use is still limited for finding and accessing&#13;
                                             formal information resources. Across the continent, users report&#13;
                                             that email has increased efficiency and reduced the cost of&#13;
                                             communication - but as yet it is used almost exclusively for&#13;
                                             contacting individuals in other regions. The WWW is still a&#13;
                                             relatively underutilized resource, although 40 percent of&#13;
                                             Zambian users questioned had conducted literature searches on&#13;
                                             the web. Further, there are signs that the Internet is beginning&#13;
                                             to play a larger role in the economies of the region.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Exporting through the Internet&#13;
&#13;
                                             African countries export many commodities that can be easily&#13;
18&#13;
&amp;#12;traded over the web'. One example is coffee. In 1997, the world&#13;
consumption of coffee exceeded eight million metric tons, up&#13;
from 6.5 in 1987, and Africa produces more than 20 percent of&#13;
the world's coffee. Of the African nations, Cote D'Ivoire,&#13;
Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya and Zaire together produce over 60&#13;
percent of the continent's coffee crops. The Ugandan Coffee&#13;
Trade Federation (UCTF) has created a home page&#13;
(www.patriot.net/-Uganda) which provides information about&#13;
coffee production, the growers, the land, and the different kinds&#13;
of ,,coffee.&#13;
       The Ugandans also examined the possibility of growing an&#13;
organic coffee, posting the idea on their web site to research the&#13;
market and find possible collaborators. The Uganda web site is&#13;
only one example of how, by having better communications,&#13;
African growers can reach out to vendors, to other growers in&#13;
the area, as well as to growers in other countries who may share&#13;
experiences with Uganda.&#13;
       There are other examples of trade and commerce on the&#13;
Internet. Craftsmen in Uganda, Senegal, Botswana, and Zimba-&#13;
bwe are now marketing their products worldwide through the&#13;
UN International Trade Center's "Virtual Handicraft Exhibition"&#13;
web site (http:/ /www.unicc.org/itc/virtexib/vexhibl.html).&#13;
       A small import-export company in Tanzania, Regent Clear-&#13;
ing and Forwarding, now uses 10 cents electronic mail messages&#13;
and $1 email-to-fax gateways instead of $20 faxes to place or-&#13;
ders for products in North America and Europe. As a result the&#13;
company has seen its telecommunications bill go from over $500&#13;
each month to $45 a month.&#13;
       Also in Tanzania, a small African shipping company,            \&#13;
Sangare Clearing and Forwarding, has eliminated one of its big-&#13;
gest expenses. As agents for Fedex and Airborne Express, the&#13;
company went through three to four rolls of triplicate telex pa-&#13;
per each day. Now it uses email to send waybill numbers and&#13;
time of delivery.&#13;
       A British supermarket is planning to use email to conduct&#13;
just-in-time purchase of chili peppers from a farm in Kenya.&#13;
       The African Market only offers products from Africa and&#13;
more specifically from Southern Africa. The product are uniquely&#13;
African or depict African themes (http: I/ www.safari-&#13;

&#13;
Take the Internet route to Africa&#13;
&#13;
In the last three years, the Internet has become a new marketing&#13;
and sales tool for travel to Africa. Several countries offer a com-&#13;
plete tourism directory on the net. Zimbabwe's, for example, is&#13;
at www.zimbabwe.net/ tourism. A visitor to this site will be able&#13;
to get information on every aspect of a trip. The site provides&#13;

                                             electricity has been rationed since the beginning of 1998 due to&#13;
                                             low rains. Repair and maintenance problems include the diffi-&#13;
                                             culties of a seven-hour bus ride to Accra over poor roads. At the&#13;
                                             moment, the center is only financially viable because it is run by&#13;
                                             volunteers: revenues are US$2,000 a year, but locals trained in&#13;
                                             computer skills and management are in high demand: they can&#13;
                                             fetch US$6,000 per year. Without a local user base of at least 35&#13;
                                             users, a commercially viable center will be impossible to oper-&#13;

                                             Uganda suggest similar problems. Complaints included diffi-&#13;
                                             culty in getting telephone lines, inadequate trained personnel,&#13;
                                             unreliable computer equipment, poor telephone links (especially&#13;
                                             when it rains) and unreliable electricity supplies (Hawkins,&#13;
                                             1998).&#13;
                                                   Another problem the Africa Internet faces right now is the&#13;
                                             poor speed of connectivity. The low bandwidth causes a slow&#13;
                                             download of sites that are hosted in Africa. This is why many of&#13;
                                             the African Internet sites mentioned earlier are hosted on serv-&#13;

                                                   The CABECA survey reports that a low level of computer&#13;

                                             ticular stifled Internet use. Overall, there was a clear correlation&#13;
                                             between low computer skills and the low number of email sent&#13;
                                             by users. This problem was exacerbated by a widespread pau-&#13;
                                             city of trainers in the countries surveyed. The high number of&#13;
                                             users per line and limited access to nodes also restrict use. How-&#13;

Providing cheaper, more reliable Internet access&#13;
&#13;
Cost appears to be a central concern of users (and certainly of&#13;
nonusers) in the African continent, then. Annex 5 presents details&#13;
on potential Internet penetration in Africa. Table 3.1 shows the&#13;
estimated cost of an Internet access point in five countries, and&#13;
average potential per person communications expenditure,&#13;
based on the (low-end) assumption that one percent of income&#13;
goes toward communications.&#13;
      The figures in Table 3.1 clearly suggest that at the moment&#13;
only the very rich in Africa will be able to afford their own&#13;
Internet connection. It also emphasizes the need for genuine&#13;
public access if the Internet is going to be widely used. Even so,&#13;
if as much as 50 percent of low-income users' potential expen-&#13;
diture on communications was harnessed to provide Internet&#13;
access to the poorest 20 percent of the population in Tanzania,&#13;
the number of Internet access points they could afford per head&#13;
at present would be one per every 25,000 (one every 800 km 2 at&#13;
average population densities). This, in turn, emphasizes the vi-&#13;
tal importance of lowering connection costs. If Tanzania's cost&#13;
of connection was to fall to South Africa's level, potential Inter-&#13;
net connectivity would increase sevenfold, raising the average&#13;
potential ratio of one terminal per 10,000 people to one per 1,500.&#13;
The results also suggest how vital&#13;
public access to community Internet         Table 3.2 The Cost of Internet Access in Mozambique per Year&#13;

                                              be US$56,000. These figures probably underrate the costs of sala-&#13;

                                               connectivity is the most expensive item.&#13;
                                                     If we look at USAID' s model of the costs of an international&#13;
                                               gateway for Mozambique's Internet, we can see again that in-&#13;
                                               ternational connectivity forms the bulk of the expenditure.&#13;
                                                     The cost breakdown in Table 3.5 indicates that around 60&#13;
                                               percent of the costs for an International ISP gateway in&#13;
                                               Mozambique is for network connectivity. The greatest percent-&#13;
                                               age of this cost is international satellite connectivity which ac-&#13;
                                               counts for 88 percent of the network costs. Not surprisingly,&#13;
                                             . sensitivity tests of the model suggest that the high international&#13;
                                               connectivity costs are a major cause of high ISP charges (see An-&#13;

                                             The telecommunications company clearly plans a vital role in&#13;

                                             termining the growth of the Internet. It is likely that a policy of&#13;
                                             active support will reap the highest rewards.&#13;
                                                  We have already seen that the Internet can be used to&#13;
                                             substitute email for voice and fax communication, but that is&#13;
                                             only one element of the relationship between Internet users and&#13;
                                             telecommunications companies. For example, PTTs gain profits&#13;
                                             from World Wide Web access. Internet access in Mozambique&#13;
                                             averages 100 hours a year per subscriber at the moment.&#13;
                                             Assuming that 90 percent of users have local access,&#13;
                                             Mozambique's PTT gains US$759,000 annually in telephone&#13;
                                             charges from users (see Annex 1 for details). If one in 20 users&#13;
                                             manage to obtain a second line dedicated to Internet use, another&#13;
                                             US$12,600 are added per year in revenues. There is also the&#13;
                                             revenue from ISP leased lines, subscriber lines and international&#13;
                                             connectivity.&#13;
                                                  Using the cost and load assumptions laid out in Annex 6, it&#13;
                                             appears that, even in Mozambique, where the PTT gains little&#13;
                                             revenue from the ISP's international connection, cost of provid-&#13;
                                             ing the services required by Internet users is below the revenues&#13;
                                             received for this service. Rough estimates suggest that present&#13;
                                             levels of Internet usage add US$500,000 to the PTT' s profits each&#13;
                                             year. The sensitivity tests carried out in Annex 1 suggest that if&#13;
                                             Internet usage was to increase in Mozambique, the extra rev-&#13;
                                             enues from calls into the ISPs would outweigh the revenue losses&#13;
                                             from email substitution. This is in the interests of the PTT to&#13;
26&#13;
&amp;#12;ensure that the Internet user base expands in the country.&#13;
      This approximation in Mozambique is supported by U.S.&#13;
evidence on the impact of the Internet on telephone companies.&#13;
Preliminary results from the U.S. suggest that:&#13;
         â&#128;¢ congestion has not caused any collapse of the&#13;
            telephone network; and&#13;
         â&#128;¢ local phone companies are actively promoting&#13;
            second line access, and additional revenue from&#13;
            second lines are six times the amount the compa-&#13;
            nies claim they need to upgrade their networks for&#13;
            handling Internet traffic.&#13;
      In other words, both the model and U.S. evidence suggest&#13;
that, while the Internet might change telephone usage patterns,&#13;
flexible PTTs should not be overly threatened by its expansion&#13;
and, in fact, should encourage it.&#13;
     One change mentioned earlier is likely to have an impact&#13;
on the rate of the Internet's expansion, however. Tariff rebalanc-&#13;
ing is narrowing the difference between the prices for local and&#13;
long distance services. In Australia, the ratio between the price&#13;
of a long distance call between Sydney and Melbourne and the&#13;
price of a local call was 45 to one in 1966. This had been reduced&#13;
to 30 to one in 1976, 15 to one in 1986 and four to one in 1996.&#13;
This trend will most likely continue in the coming years. Rebal-&#13;
ancing in usage charges of local calls versus long distance calls        As competition has whittled away the&#13;
has led to an increase of 43 percent in the price of local calls            high margin on business and long-&#13;
between 1990 and 1996 in OECD countries. In contrast, the av-             distance calls, telephone companies&#13;

over the same period.                                                residential subscribers. Some countries&#13;
      However, all PTTs are rebalancing tariffs based on tradi-               such as Canada have loaded the&#13;

                                                                     minute. Because of this, where Swedish&#13;
the Internet, or proprietary on-line data bases make calls of much&#13;
                                                                           Internet users used to pay twice as&#13;

expensive measured rates the growth of new services may be                        almost three times as much.&#13;
slowed. In countries with flat or unmeasured rates the networks&#13;
designed to handle relatively short calls may become congested.&#13;
These will need to be quickly upgraded with new technologies&#13;
designed to cope with new usage patterns.                                Finland is ahead of other developed&#13;
                                                                          countries in Internet growth, having&#13;

                                                    in the telecommunications market in 1998 and one based on the&#13;

                                                    more liberalized countries have more Internet hosts, and lower&#13;

                                                    (see Table 3.6). For both indices, 0 is a measure of little private&#13;

                                                    dex) or 7 (in the case of the liberal index) suggests a great deal&#13;
                                                    of competition in the sector.&#13;
                                                          It is similarly true that countries with competition in the&#13;

                                                    provision and a larger number of Internet hosts. Evidently, even&#13;
                                                    though there are small scale economies in this area, these are&#13;
                                                    outweighed by the efficiency gains brought on by competition.&#13;

                                                    can see in Table 3.8 that countries that are more liberal by either&#13;

                                             particular, Internet telephony and substitution threaten profits&#13;
                                             from international voice communication. However, there are at&#13;
                                             least three arguments that suggest this is not reason enough for&#13;
                                             PTTs to control or discourage Internet expansion:&#13;

                                                         its expansion on the continent cannot preserve the&#13;
                                                         status quo.&#13;
                                                     â&#128;¢ The Internet offers potential new revenue sources&#13;
                                                         - increased local call revenue and greater demand&#13;
                                                         for international bandwidth, for example. Evidence&#13;
                                                         suggests that an increased user base will generate&#13;
                                                         profits for the PTT.&#13;
                                                     â&#128;¢ There is more than enough evidence to demonstrate&#13;
                                                         the value of the Internet and its ability to encourage&#13;
                                                         economic growth in Africa. Fear of change in tele-&#13;

                                                         restrict the opportunities that the Internet presents.&#13;

                                             better across Africa, there remain policy issues. One of the ma-&#13;
                                             jor ones, already discussed, deals with rate rebalancing which&#13;
                                             may lead to an increase in the cost ot local calls and connection&#13;
                                             to the network. This presents a challenge to policies encourag-&#13;

                                             and may also restrict Internet usage. To meet this challenge, and&#13;
                                             others involving costs and access, the toolkit offers the two-&#13;
                                             pronged strategy of liberalization and competition coupled with&#13;
                                             public access.&#13;
                                                  There are other issues that may affect decision making in&#13;
                                             this sector. The toolkit offers some general principles for gov-&#13;
                                             ernment policy:&#13;
                                                     â&#128;¢ Think differently and stress openness: governments&#13;
                                                         need to treat the Internet as a new technology and&#13;
                                                         not a mere addition to the existing telecommunica-&#13;

                                                          environments.&#13;
30&#13;
&amp;#12;          â&#128;¢    Promote competition: governments should work to&#13;
               encourage competition at all levels, a tested tool for&#13;
               increasing efficiency and lowering costs.&#13;
          â&#128;¢    Avoid unnecessary regulation: governments need to&#13;
               work to avoid unnecessary interference with the&#13;
               Internet's development. The Internet has grown so&#13;
               rapidly primarily because it has been allowed the&#13;
               freedom to do so.&#13;
&#13;
Think differently&#13;
&#13;
It is important that government regulatory policies encourage&#13;
innovation and new service applications, and to do so, very of-&#13;
ten those policies have to undergo major redesign. The existing&#13;
definitions of broadcasting, publishing, and communications are&#13;
changing all over the world. Government policy must be sensi-&#13;
tive to these changes, and realize that the Internet landscape a&#13;
few years in the future may look very different from that of to-&#13;
day. Also, convergence is changing the way that voice, data, and&#13;
video content is delivered. Opportunities to create and deliver&#13;
this information will come from many sources, both domestic&#13;
and international. The regulatory infrastructure must be sensi-&#13;
tive to this and create conditions to allow many new entrants to&#13;
participate in and contribute to the development of a new infor-&#13;
mation society.&#13;
&#13;
Promote competition&#13;
&#13;
Competition in telecommunications network services, Internet&#13;
service provision, and content development should be stressed&#13;
in order to bring the greatest efficiency gains to the country.&#13;
Wherever possible, market forces should be harnessed to take&#13;
the place of direct regulatory intervention. Although new ser-&#13;
vices like Internet telephony and streaming audio and video may&#13;
create regulatory problems, these developments are positive ones&#13;
which governments should encourage.&#13;

                                             Avoid unnecessary regulation&#13;
&#13;
                                             Governments should regulate the Internet as little as possible.&#13;
                                             The ultimate objective should be less regulation for all, rather&#13;
                                             than more regulation for some. For instance, if competitive im-&#13;
                                             balance exists because a new technology is not subject to the&#13;
                                             same regulatory constraints as a competing older technology,&#13;
                                             the answer should be reduced regulation of the older technol-&#13;
                                             ogy. However, positive contributions to network development&#13;
                                             by governments are important, especially in the area of univer-&#13;

                                             and development of education and health networks.&#13;
                                                  The most common policy issues dealing with the Internet&#13;
                                             today have been categorized in five separate sections below: costs&#13;

&#13;
                                             Questions to be raised and debated about the basic nature of&#13;
                                             services offered by the Internet include:&#13;
                                                    â&#128;¢ Should the Internet be considered a part of telecom-&#13;

                                                        services?&#13;
                                                    â&#128;¢ Should the Internet fall into the existing regulations&#13;
                                                        for telecommunications or for broadcasting?&#13;
                                                    â&#128;¢ What are the benefits of liberalizing the Internet in&#13;
                                                        my country?      .&#13;
                                                    â&#128;¢ Should organizations be allowed to run private&#13;
                                                        Internet networks?&#13;
                                                  Although some African countries have already liberalized&#13;
                                             the Internet as a value-added service, many others have not. The&#13;
                                             toolkit clearly indicates that the Internet should be fully liber-&#13;

                                             International gateways&#13;
&#13;
                                             The next set of questions are concerned with restrictions that&#13;
&#13;
32&#13;
&amp;#12;relate to international Internet gateways:&#13;
        â&#128;¢ If the Internet is liberalized, should there be any&#13;
            restrictions on the number of international gate-&#13;
            ways licensed?&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Do many different international gateways present&#13;
            inefficiencies in traffic sharing within a country?&#13;
        â&#128;¢ With a number of cable and satellite ventures&#13;
            offering expanded bandwidth, should participation&#13;
            in such a system be a matter of government policy&#13;
            or should decisions be based on the business needs&#13;
            of the operators?&#13;
     Policies vary widely across the African continent. In Ghana,&#13;
ISPs have access to three gateways. There is no official limit to&#13;
gateways in Mozambique or Uganda (although this is under&#13;
consideration), but South Africa and Zimbabwe have monopoly&#13;
providers. A number of countries have allowed companies and&#13;
organizations to bypass international gateways and construct&#13;
their own private networks. The toolkit has outlined that al-&#13;
though there are economies of scale in Internet service provi-&#13;
sion, the efficiency gains from competition outweigh the gains&#13;
from economies of scale. The continued increase in international&#13;
bandwidth suggests that costs and prices will continue to fall.&#13;
Governments, therefore, should not restrict access to this sup-&#13;
ply.&#13;
&#13;
Licenses&#13;
&#13;
Licenses and associated costs for operating an Internet service&#13;
are valid concerns for any government considering a liberal en-&#13;
vironment for the Internet. Questions include:&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Should governments require licenses for Internet&#13;
           service provision?&#13;
                                                                             Policies Toward International&#13;

significance for African PTTs.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ What is the impact of local telecommunication&#13;
           service competition on Internet growth?&#13;
        â&#128;¢ How can competition be encouraged?&#13;
        â&#128;¢ What are the negative consequences of opening up&#13;
            to competition too quickly?&#13;
     The toolkit demonstrates that competition in telecommu-&#13;
nications services lowers the costs of Internet access to end users.&#13;
This suggests that competition should be encouraged as a mecha-&#13;
nism to reduce costs, provide technical innovation, improve&#13;
quality of service to customers, and provide a greater variety of&#13;
services. Local competition is likely to be a key policy instru-&#13;

&amp;#12;Management&#13;
&#13;
The Internet is a decentralized and distributed network of net-&#13;
works and thus inherently difficult, if not impossible, to con-&#13;
trol. There is no single organization that manages the Internet;&#13;
rather, many individual networks cooperate to guarantee its&#13;
success. The issue of domain name registration, however, is an&#13;
area of Internet management in which governments might need&#13;
to intervene.&#13;
&#13;
Domain name registration&#13;
&#13;
A controversial policy question in Internet management is the&#13;
control of domain names - the brand names of the Internet.&#13;
     In the U.S., Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) currently charges&#13;
US$50 per year to register a domain name. A portion of this&#13;
money goes to NSI to recover administrative costs and a portion&#13;
goes into an "Internet Intellectual Infrastructure fund". But the&#13;
existing registration process for generic top-level domains has&#13;
generated substantial controversy. Some parties have objected&#13;
to what they consider to be NSis monopoly control over a valu-&#13;
able resource, especially since an entity in the U.S. is respon-&#13;
sible for assigning addresses with international ramifications.&#13;
The International Ad Hoc Committee, comprising representa-&#13;
tives from the Internet Society, International Telecommunications&#13;
Union, the World Intellectual Property Organization and other&#13;
groups, has issued a wide-ranging proposal to restructure the&#13;
generic top-level domain name system.&#13;
     In all countries outside of the U.S., the root domain has a&#13;
country designation at the end, and one entity in the country is&#13;
charged with distributing top level domain names. In some coun-&#13;
tries other bodies are charged with assigning lower level do-&#13;
main names such as .co for a private sector company, .school for&#13;
an educational institution, and .org for an organization. Sub-&#13;
stantial debate has revolved around control of the top level do-&#13;
mains in a number of African countries. The controversy centers&#13;
around the question of whether domain name provision should&#13;
be handled by a private entity or a government entity. For in-&#13;
stance, Malawi and Zimbabwe have recently debated this issue.&#13;

                                                   All countries will have different laws governing issues such&#13;
                                             as acceptable content, intellectual property, and privacy. One&#13;
                                             area, however, in which government should focus its attention&#13;
                                             is the creation of local content. With an increase in relevant local&#13;
                                             content, it can be hoped that more users will use the Internet&#13;
                                             and the number of individuals contributing to its growth will&#13;
                                             increase. Governments can play a significant role in assisting&#13;

                                             area in which the Internet can be deployed to computerize, and&#13;

                                             of the issues that need to be considered.&#13;
                                                     â&#128;¢ What should be the government's role in the pro-&#13;
                                                        motion of telecommunications training institutes&#13;
                                                         and R&amp;D centres?&#13;
                                                     â&#128;¢ On which aspects of training should government&#13;
                                                         focus its resources?&#13;
                                                  African governments need to invest in raising awareness&#13;
                                             of the benefits of the Internet across a broad range of sectors ,&#13;
                                             including education, trade, agriculture, and health. In addition,&#13;
                                             training for end users in how to access and efficiently use the&#13;
                                             Internet, for system administrators in managing networks, and&#13;
                                             for content creators in development of data bases and web pages&#13;
                                             for accessing local content, all need to be emphasized.&#13;
&#13;
                                             In conclusion&#13;
&#13;
                                                  For all of the policy areas listed above, the solutions will be&#13;
                                             different for each country. The toolkit's aim has been to provide&#13;
                                             a broad overview of the issues and work through some of the&#13;
                                             areas that need to be given extra consideration. In all cases local&#13;
                                             models for local needs will develop to address each country's&#13;
                                             specific and unique reality. But the Internet continues to expand&#13;
                                             globally, Africa must take advantage of the opportunities offered&#13;
                                             by the unique properties of this network of networks.&#13;

                                             The Internet is likely to have a variety of effects - on users,&#13;
                                             ISPs, and telecommunications companies in Africa. Mere access&#13;
                                             to email would make an enormous difference to traditional data&#13;
                                             transmission and communication methods. In three minutes, a&#13;
                                             voice call can "transmit" two pages of information; a fax can&#13;
                                             transmit 10 pages of information; while, in the same time, a 28&#13;
                                             k/ s modem is able to send an email of between 175 and 350&#13;
                                             pages.&#13;
                                                   At such rapid speeds, email is a very attractive alternative&#13;
                                             to traditional modes of communication. However, it has high&#13;
                                             fixed costs: users require a computer and a modem in addition&#13;
                                             to a telephone, and there are costs of leasing, access, personnel&#13;
                                             and equipment of the ISP which are passed on to the user through&#13;
                                             Internet tariffs. All the same, once the equipment has been pur-&#13;
                                             chased and an email account paid for, the price of sending a&#13;
                                             single page across the country or around the world is the price&#13;
                                             of a few seconds long local call to the users' ISP. To send that&#13;
                                             page by fax may cost up to US$30 in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
                                                   In response to these opportunities, users are likely to com-&#13;
                                             municate more than they have done so far. They will email&#13;
                                             messages that they would not have bothered with if limited to&#13;
                                             voice or fax communication. But they will also substitute email&#13;
                                             for voice and fax communication, so reducing PTT revenues.&#13;
                                                   Of course, this exaggerates the scale of the problem for tele-&#13;
                                             communications companies.&#13;
                                                   First, home telecommunications companies have to pay the&#13;
                                             foreign company that provides service to the recipient an ac-&#13;
                                             counting rate fee for completing the international fax connec-&#13;
                                             tion, so that gross revenues are higher than net revenues for&#13;
                                             international calls.&#13;
                                                   Second, the telecommunications company will gain rev-&#13;
                                             enues from the ISP, which has to lease lines and equipment to&#13;
                                             connect to the Internet backbone in the U.S., along with tele-&#13;
                                             phone lines to connect to customers. Further, email substitution&#13;
                                             will reduce pressure on international connections and regional&#13;
                                             trunks, reducing the need to invest in new trunk lines. How-&#13;
                                             ever, as this need is chronic, and the effect of email on demand&#13;
                                             is unlikely to be that significant, this should provide little com-&#13;
                                             fort to the region's telecommunications companies.&#13;
                                                   Third, this is likely to be a temporary problem, and one that&#13;
42&#13;
&amp;#12;will lose its importance with the general increase in international&#13;
traffic (outgoing traffic from Sub-Saharan Africa has increased&#13;
from 322,000 minutes in 1990, to 449,000 minutes in 1994), and&#13;
the changes underway due to political and technological pres-&#13;
sures on the accounting rate regime.&#13;
      Despite these ameliorating factors, however, email substi-&#13;
tution will reduce African telecommunications company profits&#13;
from outgoing calls, at least in the short term. Also, the compa-&#13;
nies will lose revenue they presently receive in the form of ac-&#13;
counting rate charges for incoming calls when foreign customers&#13;
email African countries instead of calling. These accounting rates&#13;
are far above the real costs. For example, Cameroon's account-&#13;
ing rate with the U.S. is US$1.80 per minute, so that for every&#13;
minute of incoming calls from the U.S., Cameroon's telecom-&#13;
munications company receives 90 cents (one half of the account-&#13;
ing rate, called the settlement rate). This compares to a local call&#13;
rate of under three cents per minute. African telecommunica-&#13;
tions companies, that cross-subsidize the cost of phone installa-&#13;
tion and local calls using regional and foreign phone charge&#13;
revenue, will find that an increasing number of users are using&#13;
telephone lines mainly to make local calls to their ISPs, leading&#13;
to large per line losses.&#13;
      World Wide Web access presents its own set of problems.&#13;
On the one hand, Web browsing involves long periods of local&#13;
calling that offers revenue opportunities. Further, expanded&#13;
Internet usage in the U.S. has seen approximately 10 million&#13;
people ask for a second telephone line, which are cheap to in-&#13;
stall and profitable to offer. If this trend is repeated in Africa,&#13;
telecommunications companies can expect to earn revenue from&#13;
second line installation and rental. They can also lease lines to&#13;
ISPs to handle the large quantity of data transfer that web ac-&#13;
cess requires.&#13;
      On the other hand, networks that were not designed to&#13;
handle calls measured in hours rather than minutes can be over-&#13;
loaded by. Internet browsing, requiring the installation of new&#13;
switch and transmit equipment. Whether this balance of prob-&#13;
lems and opportunities will lead to increased profitability or&#13;
further losses depends very much on the assumptions made&#13;
about network capacity and the pricing of telecommunications&#13;
company services.&#13;
      The following model explores the above issues. It was con-&#13;
structed to do two things. First, it measures the theoretical ad-&#13;
vantages (in reduced phone and/ or fax bills) to an individual&#13;
subscriber, and revenue losses to a phone company from using&#13;
email rather than phone or fax. This is calculated based on the&#13;
number of pages of information sent. Second, it calculates ISP&#13;
cost and revenue streams (based on a monopoly international&#13;
hub), telecommunications cost and revenue streams, and user&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       43&#13;

                                                         What are the fixed costs to each method of communication?&#13;
                                                    We have assumed that a telephone line is already installed (all&#13;
                                                    compared systems would require a telephone, anyway). There&#13;
                                                    is no extra equipment required to make a voice call, so the "fixed&#13;
                                                    cost" of phoning is zero. The fixed cost to faxing information is&#13;
                                                    the yearly cost of a fax machine allowing for depreciation and&#13;
                                                    cost of capital. Here, it has been estimated to be in the region of&#13;
                                                    US$155 per year. For email, the fixed cost is taken to be Internet&#13;
                                                    access charges and the cost of a computer and a modem, allow-&#13;

                                                    Given that computers are useful for far more than Internet ac-&#13;

                                                    costs effectively overestimates this cost. Internet access as de-&#13;

                                                    emailing also effectively overestimates the fixed costs of&#13;
                                                    emailing. The high cost of capital discriminates against emailing&#13;
                                                    as a cheap communications option as well. Therefore, the fixed&#13;
                                                    costs of emailing presented here are, if anything, exaggerated.&#13;
                                                          What are the costs of delivering this information per page?&#13;
                                                    As mentioned above, a person can read out a page of informa-&#13;
                                                    tion in about one and a half minutes. A fax can transmit the same&#13;
                                                    information in about 18 seconds. A standard 28 k/ s modem&#13;
                                                    should take around half a second to transmit the data. On the&#13;
                                                    basis of data given above, we can calculate the approximate cost&#13;
                                                    of sending a page of information by multiplying the number of&#13;
                                                    pages by the amount of time taken in minutes, dividing by three&#13;
                                                    and multiplying by the cost of a three minute call.&#13;
                                                          The actual time spent transferring data by email is prob-&#13;
                                                    ably shorter than the time taken to connect and disconnect from&#13;
                                                    the email server. To calculate the yearly cost of emailing, then,&#13;
&#13;
    44&#13;
&amp;#12;we have assumed that each business day it takes three minutes&#13;
to connect, upload and download email, and disconnect. This&#13;
gives a flat amount that emailers are likely to have to pay in&#13;
telephone charges. For emailers dialing into a local ISP, this will&#13;
amount to 260 multiplied by the cost of a three minute local call.&#13;
For emailers dialing into an ISP in a different region of the coun-&#13;
try, this will amount to 260 multiplied by the cost of a three&#13;
minute regional call. This is the only telephone charge that&#13;
emailers will face - in that three minute period, they can down-&#13;
load and upload their email for other regions in the country and&#13;
for other countries in the world. Once again, charging all email&#13;
telephone costs to local email (rather than dividing it up amongst&#13;
local, regional and international) gives an exaggerated picture&#13;
of the costs of local emailing.&#13;
      As is clear from Table Al.2, email is not a great money saver&#13;
on local calls in Mozambique. If a user talks on the telephone&#13;
for about 250 hours a year (about an hour each business day),&#13;
enough time to "speak" 10,000 pages, even over a local email&#13;
service the difference between email and voice costs is a mere&#13;
US$190. This is far less than the difference in fixed costs between&#13;
voice and email ($1,172). Given that email and voice are not&#13;
perfect substitutes, then, consumers will most likely continue&#13;
to use local voice whenever it is preferable.&#13;
      With regional calls, however, the savings are larger. Be-&#13;
cause the costs of email have all been accounted for, the cost of&#13;
10,000 pages of regional email is close to zero. This compares to&#13;
a cost of US$3,000 forl0,000 pages spoken (in 250 hours).&#13;
This difference is enough to pay for an emailer's com-          Table A 1.2 Non-Fixed Cost of&#13;

      International communication is where the savings&#13;
become impressive. Talking for about an hour each busi-         Regional&#13;

yearly savings amount to US$6,322. For example, a busi-         Phone             383   3,825 38,250&#13;

&amp;#12;of email each year, the loss to the telephone company amounts&#13;
to US$7,650 in revenue per year if the email is substituting for&#13;
fax and US$38,250 in revenue per year if the email is substitut-&#13;
ing for voice.&#13;
      With the accounting rate calculation, it is possible to make&#13;
a rough estimate of the lost profits from email substitution. The&#13;
settlement rate is meant to compensate for the cost of delivering&#13;
the traffic from half way between the countries to the recipient&#13;
(the half circuit). In fact, accounting rates are known to be well&#13;
above cost. However, they present an upper estimate of the cost&#13;
of providing the connection. Three minutes of traffic at account-&#13;
ing rate cost equals US$3.57. The amount charged to Mozambican&#13;
users is US$7.65, suggesting an approximate profit margin to&#13;
the telephone company on outgoing calls of US$4.08, or 114 per-&#13;
cent. Given that real upper-bound estimates of the costs to tele-&#13;
communications companies of providing this service are&#13;
estimated at closer to 30 to 40 cents per minute, profit margins&#13;
rise to US$7.15 a minute.&#13;
      Data based broadly on the Mozambique cost and price struc-&#13;
ture for Internet provision, telecommunications supply and&#13;
equipment and usage levels, help to demonstrate the present&#13;
and potential financial impact of the Internet on ISPs, telecom-&#13;

                                                  many companies list their depreciation and amorti-&#13;
                                                  zation in a separate account. The cost of revenues&#13;
                                                  includes direct labor, direct overhead and any other&#13;
                                                  direct cost. Most U.S. ISPs and OLSPs (online&#13;
                                                  service provider) have about 40 to 60 percent of&#13;
                                                  their costs accounted for by costs of revenues.&#13;
                                                  African ISPs are likely to face higher costs because&#13;
                                                  of their higher costs of equipment, financing and&#13;
                                                  communications in the region.&#13;
&#13;
                                               2. The sales and marketing cost is a component that&#13;
                                                  should not be neglected. In the U.S., marketing&#13;
                                                  expenses account for 20 to 30 percent of total costs.&#13;
                                                  A large percentage of these costs is attributed to the&#13;
                                                  high comp~tition that exists among ISPs. A market-&#13;

                                                  because it can help overcome the competition&#13;
                                                  (although this might become increasingly impor-&#13;
                                                  tant), but because it may be used as a tool to en-&#13;
                                                  courage Internet use and increase Internet penetra-&#13;

                                                  underestimate the long term costs of Internet ser-&#13;

&#13;
                                               3. The research and development account of the OLSP&#13;
                                                  is much higher than that for the simple ISP in the&#13;
                                                  U.S. Unlike ISPs that provide simple connectivity,&#13;
                                                  the OLSP provides content and other Internet&#13;
                                                  applications as well. This requires the companies to&#13;
                                                  invest in product development and content. African&#13;
                                                  ISPs are also likely to have to develop content&#13;
                                                  because of the language issues and the need for&#13;
                                                  local content. Again, this is a cost not accounted for&#13;
                                                  in the main model.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Despite these problems, we believe that the model offers a&#13;

&#13;
reasonably good estimate of ISP costs and telecommunications&#13;
company revenues from ISPs.&#13;
      Assumptions necessary to the model are based on a range&#13;
of sources and estimates. Here, it should be noted that, as op-&#13;
posed to the results above, the assumption is that subscribers&#13;
share computers.&#13;
      In the Mozambican case, the primary source of telecommu-&#13;
nications company revenues from the Internet is the extra user&#13;
traffic. This new traffic will be driven by the use of WWW, and&#13;
not email. In Mozambique, the total user access to the Internet&#13;
adds US$760,000 to phone bills. A monopoly ISP would pay a&#13;
surprisingly small amount to Mozambique Telecom (US$36,600).&#13;
This is both because thereÂ· is no ISP license charge in the coun-&#13;
try, and because most payments for international access go to&#13;
the Leland link, rather than the Mozambique PTT. Further, leased&#13;
lines in Mozambique, at only US$6,000 for a connection to the&#13;
Leland link, are very cheap.&#13;
      In Kenya, on the other hand, where a 64k international&#13;
leased line connection costs US$177,000, ISP costs would be a&#13;
more significant percentage of total telecoms revenues (although&#13;
still smaller than user access). This also has a significant impact&#13;
on ISP profits. The relatively low cost of international Internet&#13;
connectivity, and the relatively low need for bandwidth because&#13;
of low usage, reduce dramatically the most significant portion&#13;
of an ISP' s costs in Mozambique. Although telephone, leased&#13;
line, satellite ari.d Internet connections account for about 48 per-&#13;
cent of the ISP's budget when it has 3,500 subscribers, this is&#13;
                                                                                                     51&#13;

&#13;
appears that lowering the cost of telephone and Internet access&#13;
is probably the most significant thing that countries can do to&#13;
encourage users to access the new technology.&#13;
     By changing some of the underlying assumptions of the&#13;
model, it is possible to see the impact on ISP revenues. The first&#13;
scenario presents the base scenario, which suggests very large&#13;
profits for the hypothetical ISP. The second scenario is that the&#13;
ISP brings up its Internet access standards to international norms,&#13;
and that a 64 kps line is sufficient for 10 people to be on line at&#13;
any one time. Given average use of 100 hours per year, the aver-&#13;
age user is online 0.115 percent of the time, suggesting that, at&#13;
average loads, a 64 kps bandwi.dth is satisfactory for 874 sub-&#13;
scribers. Figures from NCS in Ghana suggest that peak hours&#13;
see up to three times the number of people on line than the av-&#13;
erage load. To provide a good quality of Internet access, there-&#13;
fore, 64kps of bandwidth is required for at least every 400&#13;
subscribers. Altering this assumption reduces ISP profits, but&#13;
because international bandwidth is so cheap, profits remain ex-&#13;
tremely healthy.&#13;
     In the third scenario, the cost of international bandwidth is&#13;
raised to US$170,000 for 64 kps. This is similar to prices paid by&#13;
ISPs in other countries, including Kenya. Raising the price of&#13;
connectivity at the present&#13;
level of service reduces prices&#13;
more significantly, bringing          Scenario ISP Profits (US$) at Number of Users&#13;
down ISP profits to 1.2 million&#13;
at the present level of usage.                  O users      1,000 users 3,500 users     10,000 users&#13;

&amp;#12;Annex Two:&#13;
Calculation of Telecommunications Revenue&#13;
Lost to Substitution Using FCC Data&#13;
&#13;
A second simple way to estimate the approximate losses to tele-&#13;
communications companies from international substitution is&#13;
presented below. We have already presented estimates for the&#13;
amount of incoming and outgoing telephone and fax traffic the&#13;
average user substitutes with email. The FCC, as part of its at-&#13;
tempts to put downward pressure on international accounting&#13;
rates, has estimated the real cost per minute for countries to ter-&#13;
minate an international call (the "half circuit cost") for a range&#13;
of countries. This will be broadly the same as the cost of origi-&#13;
nating the call (both halves of the circuit are identical). In Af-&#13;
rica, numbers are presented for Kenya (42.6 cents/minute) and&#13;
South Africa (16.9 cents/ minute). Despite methodological prob-&#13;
lems with the FCC' s calculations, these numbers should approxi-&#13;
mate the real costs of completing a call. We also know the&#13;
accounting rate and the international call charges of a range of&#13;
African countries. With all of this data, we can estimate the&#13;
amount of profit (revenue minus cost) that telecommunications&#13;
companies lose from each email user each year (using the Kenya&#13;
number as an upper bound of costs and South Africa as a lower&#13;
bound). This leads to the figures below:&#13;

the data between 1998 and previous years are not strictly com-&#13;

 suggest that liberalization is a boon to the spread of the Internet&#13;
 in Africa.&#13;
       The method of calculating the cost of Internet access above&#13;
 excludes one important component of the cost of access: the price&#13;
 of calling the ISP. Table A3.5 is based on a broadly similar meth-&#13;
 odology to the OECD' s Report on Information Infrastructure Con-&#13;
 vergence and Pricing (1996), which is the source of the OECD data&#13;
 reported in the table. Data on the pricing policies of African&#13;
 ISPs are from Jensen (1997), data on PTT pricing are taken from&#13;
 the ITU (1997). The price per month for Internet access is calcu-&#13;
 lated as follows: The ISP connection charge divided by 36, the&#13;
 monthly charge, and any extra charges that apply to 20 or 30&#13;
 hours of use. The PTT charge is the telephone connection charge&#13;
 divided by 60, the monthly charge for a telephone and the cost&#13;
 of 20 or 30 hours of local calls (multiplied up from the three-&#13;
 minute local call rate reported by the ITU). African countries in&#13;
 gray in the table have comparatively "liberal" telecommunica-&#13;
 tions sectors, scoring more than three on the liberalization in-&#13;
 dex based on World Bank data.&#13;
       In the OECD, seven out of the eight countries with tele-&#13;
 communications infrastructure competition had cheaper than&#13;
 average total access charges while 12 of the 17 countries with-&#13;
 out competition were above the same benchmark (OECD, 1996).&#13;
.These results are mirrored in estimates for African Internet pro-&#13;
 vision. Some African countries provide very competitive Internet&#13;
 access as compared to the OECD (although it should be noted&#13;
 that the calculation does not follow exactly the same methodol-&#13;
 ogy). Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, Senegal and South&#13;
 Africa, all provide~cheaper overall Internet access than the OECD&#13;
 average, for example. On the other hand, closed telecommuni-&#13;
 cations regimes in Africa provide 30 hours of Internet access at&#13;
 more than twice the OECD average cost. Only one closed re-&#13;
 gime provides cheaper Internet access than the OECD average&#13;
 - Lesotho. Lesotho appears to benefit from its proximity to the&#13;

&amp;#12;efficient (and large) South African telecommunications market.&#13;
Open telecommunications regimes in Africa appear to provide&#13;
both cheaper ISP charges and cheaper PTT charges. This sug-&#13;
gests that market efficiencies rather than rebalancing lead to&#13;
cheaper access.&#13;
     Statistical analysis of the determinants of Internet penetra-&#13;
tion in Africa (this time including South Africa) confirms this&#13;
finding. Running a regression of Internet hosts in each country&#13;
against a constant and population (regression 1), there is a posi-&#13;
tive relationship, but it is insignificant. Replacing population&#13;
with GDP produces a strong positive relationship which is highly&#13;
significant (regression 2). Undoubtedly, then, wealth plays a&#13;
large role in determining the extent of Internet penetration in&#13;
Africa. However, replacing GDP with number of computers (re-&#13;
gression 3) produces an even better fit - the number of com-&#13;
puters in a country explains 85 percent of the variation in the&#13;
number of Internet hosts. This is a result that echoes one found&#13;
by the OECD (1996) for richer countries and by the ITU with a&#13;
global sample (1997). When entered with GDP per capita, the&#13;
number of computers in a country remains significantly corre-&#13;
lated with Internet penetration, whereas GDP does not (regres-&#13;
sion 4). The number of personal computers and population, when&#13;
entered together in a regression (5), account for 98 percent of&#13;
the variation in the number of Internet hosts in the 16 African&#13;
countries for which we have data. It has to be assumed that the&#13;
number of computers per capita is proxying for a technology-&#13;
friendly environment in general. This suggests that, while&#13;
wealth is undoubtedly one important determinant of such an&#13;
environment, even poor African countries can encourage far&#13;
wider Internet penetration by becoming more technology&#13;
friendly.&#13;
     However, it should be pointed out that these results will be&#13;
driven largely by South Africa. Further, regressing the number&#13;
of Internet hosts per capita against variables, found GDP per&#13;
capita a stronger determinant of Internet penetration than com-&#13;
puters per capita. Regressions of Internet hosts per capita against&#13;
GDP per capita and the cost of a local call, percentage of lines&#13;
that were digital, main lines per capita, modems per capita or&#13;
minutes of outgoing calls as percentage of incoming calls, found&#13;
all variables except GDP per capita insignificant.&#13;

                                      Table A4.1 presents a list of African countries and an "account-&#13;
                                      ing index". The index is designed to be a very rough measure of&#13;
                                      a country's reliance on income from accounting rates. It is cal-&#13;
                                      culated as follows:&#13;
                                           ((no of minutes, international telephone traffic in) - (no. of&#13;
                                      minutes, international traffic out))* (one half the accounting rate&#13;
                                      with the United States) all expressed as a percentage of GDP.&#13;
                                           This measure can only be an approximation for a number&#13;
                                      of reasons. First, if we take the example of Swaziland, it is prob-&#13;
                                      able that the huge negative index score, based on more outgo-&#13;
                                      ing than incoming traffic, is because of a disparity of calls with&#13;
                                                           South Africa, not a disparity with the US. To&#13;

                                             Bank, the model presented here estimates the potential expen-&#13;

                                             nectivity. This is based on the common assumption that&#13;
                                             communities are willing to spend around one percent of their&#13;
                                             income on access to telephones. Taking this number, estimates&#13;

                                             costs and willingness to spend. There are three sets of estimates.&#13;
                                             The first assumes that all expenditure will go to telephone con-&#13;
                                             nectivity, the second that 75 percent will go to telephone con-&#13;
                                             nectivity, but consumers will be willing to spend 25 percent of&#13;
                                             their connectivity budget on the Internet. The third set assumes&#13;
                                             that the connectivity expenditure will be evenly divided between&#13;
                                             the Internet and the telephone. The estimates measure expected&#13;
                                             teledensity, or telephones per 100 people (teledens), and expected&#13;
                                             Internet density, or computers hooked to the Internet per 100&#13;
                                             people (netdens), for each of the five income groups, as well as&#13;
                                             an average. Below that, the total number of telephones and com-&#13;
                                             puters hooked to the Internet is estimated, and this number used&#13;
                                             to calculate an average density in terms of telephones or Inter-&#13;
                                             net sites per square kilometer.&#13;
                                                   The model, as it stands, appears to overestimate the actual&#13;
                                             number of telephones in the countries. There are two reasons&#13;
                                             for this, both connected with policy choices. The first is the prob-&#13;
                                             lem of waiting lists. In countries where political pressure keeps&#13;
                                             the costs of access low without concomitant transfers or subsi-&#13;

                                             ated by below-cost service provision. This leads to huge waiting&#13;
                                             lists and low levels of satisfied demand. In Tanzania, the wait-&#13;
                                             ing time for a telephone is more than 10 years and satisfied de-&#13;

                                             percent).&#13;
                                                   The second and more significant reason for the model over-&#13;
                                             estimating telephone demand is that although models based on&#13;
                                             the "one percent of expenditure" assumption do quite well in&#13;

Given this, an actual teledensity&#13;
of 9.45 is fairly respectable. In&#13;
Tanzania, only households in the very top of the top income&#13;
quintile will be able to afford a telephone or own telephones in&#13;
their businesses. The issue with such an assumption is that stud-&#13;
ies also suggest that if given access to public telephones, poorer&#13;
people will spend one percent or more of their income on con-&#13;
nectivity. This suggests that achievable teledensity, given pro-&#13;
active efforts to install public telephones, should be higher than&#13;
present-day teledensities. If Tanzania was to raise the number&#13;
of payphones per inhabitant from 0.02 to China's level of 0.70,&#13;
for example, this would increase the country's overall teledensity&#13;
by nearly 25 percent (from 0.30 to 0.37).&#13;
      While the model overestimates actual telephone densities,&#13;
it allows us to estimate potential order of magnitude telephone&#13;
and Internet densities under the assumption of expanded pub-&#13;
lic access to telephones and the Internet. Perhaps the first (and&#13;
most obvious) thing to be noticed is that achievable teledensity&#13;
or netdensity is highly dependent on two factors - the wealth&#13;
of the community and the cost of telephone or Internet access.&#13;
Looking at telephone access to begin with, we can see that po-&#13;
tential density varies enormously between countries. If no ex-&#13;
penditure is assumed to be going to Internet connectivity,&#13;
countrywide potential teledensity varies between 18.38 in South&#13;
Africa to 2.12 in Tanzania. Potential teledensity also varies im-&#13;
mensely between income brackets - for the poorest quintile in&#13;
Sou th Africa, the potential number of telephones per 100 people&#13;
is little higher than the average for Tanzania, at 3.04.&#13;
      If we now look at potential Internet density, it is clear that,&#13;
if expenditure on Internet access substitutes for access to tele-&#13;
phones, increasing netdensity will have an impact on teledensity.&#13;
Because access to the Internet is so much more expensive than&#13;
access to a telephone, this will reduce average teledensity. To&#13;
take the Tanzanian case, if Internet access expenditures substi-&#13;
tute for 50 percent of expenditures that presently go toward tele-&#13;
phone access, teledensity will drop from a potential 2.12per100&#13;
                                                                                                              71&#13;

                                             phones attached to an Internet access point), while net density&#13;
                                             will reach only 0.01per100 people. In terms of average number&#13;
                                             of potential telephones and Internet access points per square km,&#13;
                                             the number of potential telephones would fall from one every&#13;
                                             one and a half km 2 to one every three km 2, while the number of&#13;
                                             Internet sites would reach one every 333 km2 â&#128;¢&#13;
                                                   Of course, the picture is not that bleak. First, because of the&#13;
                                             potential of the Internet, it is likely that expenditure on access&#13;
                                             would be as much additional as it was substitutive (especially&#13;
                                             for rich users). Second, potential teledensity at 50 percent ex-&#13;
                                             penditure on the Internet is still higher than actual teledensity&#13;
                                             achieved in Tanzania (1.06 compared to 0.30 per 100 people).&#13;
                                             This suggests that the problem of substitution expenditure on&#13;
                                             the Internet driving down teledensity is likely to be largely theo-&#13;
                                             retical.&#13;
                                                   It is clear, however, that the price of communication access,&#13;
                                             especially access to the Internet, is prohibitive for many. Even if&#13;

                                             was harnessed to provide Internet access to the poorest 20 per-&#13;
                                             cent in Tanzania, the number of Internet access points that they&#13;
                                             could afford per head at present prices would be one for each&#13;
                                             25,000 of them, or one every 800 km2 at average population den-&#13;
                                             sities. Obviously, this is not a sustainable level of access.&#13;
                                                   Despite this, policy changes can be made to increase Inter-&#13;
                                             net access to a larger segment of the population. Tanzania's&#13;
                                             yearly Internet access costs (including equipment), at US$5,425,&#13;
                                             are more than five times the South African yearly Internet ac-&#13;
                                             cess costs of US$793. If Tanzania were to bring down the costs&#13;
                                             of Internet access to South African levels, potential Internet con-&#13;
                                             nectivity in the country would skyrocket. At a rate of 50 percent&#13;
                                             of potential communications expenditure being used for Inter-&#13;
                                             net access, average net density per 100 people would rise from&#13;
                                             0.01to0.07 (or one per 10,000 to one per 1,500). At average popu-&#13;
                                             lation density, this suggests that the maximum walk to the near-&#13;
                                             est Internet access point would drop from about three hours long&#13;
                                             to around one hour (10.5km to 3.9km).&#13;
                                             The primary reason for cheaper Internet service provision in&#13;
                                             South Africa is cheaper access to leased lines and the Internet&#13;
                                             backbone. South Africa Telkom has been able to afford this&#13;
                                             cheaper backbone access in part through rate rebalancing be-&#13;
                                             tween value added services and basic services. While greater&#13;
                                             efficiency undoubtedly plays a large role, it is also clear that&#13;
                                             South Africa's basic provision of telephone services is more ex-&#13;
                                             pensive than Tanzania's (a yearly cost of US$178.2, as compared&#13;
                                             to US$57.33). Perhaps, then, it is fairer to take the whole bundle&#13;
                                             of South African costs and apply them to Tanzania. As before,&#13;
                                             we see far higher Internet access (although a little lower than&#13;
&#13;
72&#13;
&amp;#12;the SA Internet prices, because of the extra telephone charges).&#13;
Yet, potential teledensity drops from 1.06 in the base case to 0.34&#13;
in the South African prices model. While overstating the case,&#13;
this raises an important policy issue. If the costs of Internet ser-&#13;
vice provision are reduced by lowering the costs of broadband&#13;
access, this will reduce a source of cross-subsidy for basic tele-&#13;
phone provision. In an environment of inefficiencies in public&#13;
telephone monopolies, where demand cannot be met for basic&#13;
telephone provision anyway, it should be possible to both re-&#13;
duce the costs ofinternational connectivity for Internet service&#13;
providers and continue provision of basic telephone services at&#13;
reasonably low cost. However, there might be at least short term&#13;
costs in terms of basic telephone service provision.&#13;

the Internet Cost-Benefit Model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The first two pages of the model list the data required to esti-&#13;
mate the effects of Internet penetration on users, ISPs and tele-&#13;
communications companies (C5-C65 and E71 to E83). Much of&#13;
the data required is self-explanatory, but a few points should be&#13;
made, and information on sources given.&#13;
&#13;
Phone charges&#13;
&#13;
The cost of a three-minute call has been used for the sake of&#13;
convenience. It is the rate published by the ITU. When used as a&#13;
basis for calculating the cost of a 30-minute or longer call (which&#13;
is the more likely length of a connection to the Internet), it is&#13;
obviously going to produce inaccuracies, usually overpricing the&#13;
cost of a call of that length. In Ghana, for example, the price of a&#13;
three-minute local call is 200 cedis, the price of a 30-minute lo-&#13;
cal call is only 1,400 cedis.&#13;
     The cost of a regional call will have to be an average, if there&#13;
are many different regional call rates. Table A6.1 provides ap-&#13;
proximations from available data. The cost of an international&#13;
call would preferably be weighted based on international call&#13;
destinations. Here, we have taken estimates from available data.&#13;
We have chosen the U.K. or the U.S. accounting rates to act as&#13;
an estimate for the average accounting rate charged and received&#13;
by the African telecommunications company.&#13;

                                      In South Africa, the number of users is estimated at 700,000, while&#13;
                                      Zimbabwe is estimated to have 10,000 users. Information from&#13;
                                      UEM in Mozambique provides an estimate of approximately&#13;

                                      Ghana are around 5,000 users (up from 60 in 1995). Ethiopia has&#13;

    The average user statistics ask for the average number of&#13;
    email sent and received. Looking at data from the CABECA          0-10                                 73&#13;
    survey for Uganda and Ethiopia, it is possible to estimate        11-20                                32&#13;
    the average number of email sent by each user. The data           21-30                                27&#13;
    from user surveys suggest fairly high levels (and these fig-      31-40                                19&#13;
                                                                      41-50                                3&#13;
    ures exclude the receipt of mass-mailings).&#13;
                                                                      51-60                                5&#13;
          The data suggest that users send somewhat more email&#13;
                                                                      60+                                  4&#13;
    than they receive, and (on average) send over one email a&#13;
    day. There are problems of selection bias with this data,&#13;
    however (it is likely to have excluded those with an ac-&#13;
    count which they do not use). CABECA also asked for node data&#13;
    on email usage which is likely to be more reliable. The two tables,&#13;
    A6.4 and A6.5, enumerate the number of outgoing email per&#13;
    subscriber from the node.&#13;
          The number of email sent over a month for all subscribers,&#13;
    suggests an average of 20 email per month, or about one each&#13;
    business day - a fair estimate for present African usage levels.&#13;
    Annually, this might amount to 240 email. As the number of in-&#13;
    coming email appears to be lower, we might estimate this at&#13;
    about 200. The average length of email in Mozambique can be&#13;
    estimated at about three and a half pages. 1&#13;
          Next, the model asks for the percentage of these email that&#13;
    are replacing telephone calls and faxes, excluding "new" email&#13;
    traffic. "New" email consists of email that contain information&#13;
    which otherwise would not have been sent by fax or phone. It is&#13;
    assumed that much email traffic will be new, because of the very&#13;
    low marginal cost of sending an email. However, empirical evi-&#13;
    dence suggests that there is also substitution occurring. In all of&#13;
    the countries of the CABECA survey, respondents reported&#13;
    that email had saved money on their communications bud-&#13;
    gets. The CABECA study in Uganda reveals that the method          Table A6.5&#13;
    of communication most commonly replaced by email is sur-          Frequency of Use of Email            in&#13;
    face and air mail, followed by fax, telephone and telex. Tele-    Ethiopia: Data from Node&#13;
    phone and fax service savings were the most significant&#13;
                                                                               Number of emails      No. of subscribers&#13;
                                                                               sent in two months&#13;
    1      This estimate is, admittedly, back of the envelope. UEM estimated&#13;
    that 60 percent of their outgoing traffic was emails. For the month of&#13;
    February, this amounted to 2.037 mb of emails. UEM has an estimated&#13;
    2,000 users, who send approximately one email per day, or a total of       &lt;30                          143&#13;
    40,000 emails per month. The average length of an email is then 50.93      30-61                        16&#13;
    kb, or about three and a half pages. Senegal's average email length is     61-122                       20&#13;
    estimated by ISPs there to be about 50 kb, although a Namibian ISP         &gt;122                         27&#13;
    estimated the average length at just five kb, or under half a page.&#13;

                                             source of reductions in communication budgets brought on by&#13;
                                             email (also mentioned were savings on publications, courier and&#13;
                                             postal fees and travel). It is fair to assume, then, that 35 percent&#13;
                                             of email traffic is substituting for either phone or fax.&#13;
                                                   World wide, fax is estimated to account for 40 percent of&#13;
                                             international phone traffic. This is because fax is considered a&#13;
                                             more efficient means of communication, transferring informa-&#13;

                                             stitute for fax, estimates from the CABECA study suggest that&#13;
                                             about 25 percent of email traffic is substituting for faxes and 10&#13;
                                             percent for voice calls. The remaining 65 percent substitutes for&#13;
                                             other forms of communication (primarily post) or is new traffic.&#13;
                                                   The statistics also ask for the destination of outgoing email.&#13;
                                             In a user survey conducted in Uganda during the CABECA study,&#13;
                                             80 percent of respondents had not yet used email for local ex-&#13;
                                             change of information, but had done so to communicate with&#13;
                                             partners abroad. Eighty-two percent of Ethiopian users said that&#13;
                                             less than 10 percent of email traffic they sent stayed in-country,&#13;
                                             although in the more Internet-dense country of Zambia the fig-&#13;
                                             ure was 26 percent. The CABECA study suggests that approxi-&#13;
                                             mately 56 percent of email from Uganda have destinations&#13;
                                             outside the continent, 27 percent have destinations in Africa but&#13;
                                             not within the country, and only 17 percent are for recipients&#13;
                                             within Uganda. Given that the great majority of users in Africa&#13;
                                             appear to reside in capital cities, this implies that the percent-&#13;
                                             age of email with a different region in the same country is very&#13;
                                             low indeed.&#13;
                                                   All of the above lead to the assumption that, per subscriber,&#13;
                                             email replaces about 68.9 minutes a year of outgoing interna-&#13;
                                             tional telephone calls (voice and fax), 4.1 minutes of regional&#13;
                                             calls, 12.2 minutes of local calls and 57.4 minutes per year of&#13;
                                             incoming international calls.&#13;
&#13;
                                             PTT charges to ISPs&#13;
&#13;
                                             We already know that licensing costs are a significant percent-&#13;
                                             age of revenues for ISPs in some countries. Another major charge&#13;
                                             is the cost of leased line or VSAT connection to the Internet. The&#13;
                                             yearly charge is the portion paid to the PTT (any portion paid to&#13;
                                             foreign telephone companies or other providers should be listed&#13;
                                             below at C63). In Mozambique, the PTT charges US$250 a month&#13;
                                             for a 64 kbs leased line to a satellite connection provided by the&#13;
                                             Leland initiative. Leland charges US$2,000 a month for a con-&#13;
                                             nection from there to the U.S. Internet backbone (this would be&#13;
                                             covered by "Internet Backbone connection" charges, C64, with&#13;
                                             no separate foreign telco charge for 64 kb VSAT /LL, line C61).&#13;
                                             The major Internet provider, the UEM, pays US$4,982 a month&#13;
                                             to Transtel, a South African company, for a leased line to South&#13;
&#13;
80&#13;
&amp;#12;Africa's Internet backbone plus a usage-based charge to UNINET&#13;
for access. They are willing to pay this premium for a more reli-&#13;
able service. Their costs will fall, however, if they are able to&#13;
negotiate a ~iirect connection to the U.S. provided by Lyman&#13;
Brothers for US$3,000 a month for 128 kbs. This suggests the&#13;
advances that scale, technology and competition can make in&#13;
cutting costs and increasing reliability for the Internet.&#13;
     On the spreadsheet, not all points to enter information are&#13;
necessarily relevant in all cases. In Mozambique, for example,&#13;
payments to the PTT (C55) cover only the local leased line. For&#13;
the international connection portion, the Leland Initiative link&#13;
covers all costs. The charge by Leland includes Internet back-&#13;
bone access, and so there is only one lump sum to count (thus&#13;
the zero charge for backbone access). Data for setup costs in-&#13;
clude leased line setup (C61), so, again, this is not counted as a&#13;
separate charge. If the local telecommunications company is not&#13;
providing the leased line service, as in Ghana, the cost to it of&#13;
provision (C55) should be zero.&#13;
&#13;
PTT details&#13;
&#13;
Estimations of the cost of a main line in Africa vary greatly be-&#13;
tween countries. The ITU has found that costs per line vary be-&#13;
tween US$1,000 and US$8,000 per subscriber line, with an&#13;
average of around US$4,250. This compares to a world average&#13;
cost of US$1,500. It should be pointed out that this high cost&#13;
will largely be the result of two factors: inefficiencies in African&#13;
telecommunications companies and difficulties due to subscriber&#13;
density and geography. A recent World Bank study has estimated&#13;
a reasonable capital cost per line of rural telephones to be&#13;
US$5,000 in Kenya, US$6,000 in Zimbabwe and US$8,000 in&#13;
Uganda. Fifty-nine percent, 51 percent and 71 percent of tele-&#13;
phones are in the largest cities in these countries, however. There-&#13;
fore, the average cost of a line should be much lower. Nonetheless,&#13;
in Mozambique, the average cost of a main line has been esti-&#13;
mated at US$4,500 (estimates for South Africa are closer to&#13;
US$1,000). The recurrent costs of a telephone line are estimated&#13;
at about US$600 for South Africa. The cost of installing a second&#13;
line is - at least on more modern lines - considerably below&#13;
that of installing the first. For Mozambique, it may be assumed&#13;
as one-sixth of the cost, or US$500. According to a World bank&#13;
study in Tanzania, exchange equipment amounted to about 25&#13;
percent of the cost of a line, suggesting a cost in Mozambique of&#13;
about US$1,125.&#13;
      The cost of providing the satellite and/ or leased line has to&#13;
be calculated on a yearly basis. The cost of leased line provision&#13;
to the PTT is likely to be significantly below the rates which it&#13;
charges. Mozambique is charging US$250 per month for local&#13;
                                                                       81&#13;

                                             those of telephone connections. A 1.2 meter ground station with&#13;
                                             64 kbs capacity costs US$10,000. Renting space on a satellite and&#13;
                                             a hub station costs about US$1,750 per month. Mike Jensen esti-&#13;
                                             mates a monthly cost of operating a 64 kbs VSAT at about&#13;
                                             US$4,000 to US$5,000 (of which about US$2,000 would go to the&#13;
                                             satellite company and hub station).&#13;
                                                  There are large economies of scale to international commu-&#13;

                                             This suggests that PTTs should be able to provide one half of a ,&#13;

                                             perhaps a further US$2,500 per month to foreign providers - a&#13;
                                             total of US$60,000 a year.&#13;

                                             computer terminal. In the first part of the model, the assump-&#13;
                                             tion is that each user has his or her own computer. In the second&#13;
                                             part of the model, it is assumed that subscribers share comput-&#13;
                                             ers. Evidence from the CABECA study suggests between four to&#13;
                                             eight users per terminal (or around two to four subscribers). This&#13;
                                             reduces user cost of access to the Internet. Another assumption&#13;
                                             considers the amount of time it takes to access an email account&#13;
                                             (as opposed to using the Web). A three-minute link up every&#13;
                                             business day could theoretically transmit 91,000 pages of infor-&#13;
                                             mation each year. Thus, the model assumes that the length of&#13;
                                             time spent accessing email is determined not by the amount of&#13;
                                             data transferred, but by the number of times during the day the&#13;
                                             email account is accessed, and the amount of time taken each&#13;
                                             time to do so. The CABECA survey suggests that the average&#13;
                                             African user accesses his or her account at least once a day. The&#13;
                                             time taken will be brief; here we have assumed three minutes.&#13;
&#13;
82&#13;
&amp;#12;       As for the number of subscribers who are likely to obtain a&#13;
second line dedicated to web access (measured in terms of ter-&#13;
minals), in the U.S., this figure is as high as 40 percent of Inter-&#13;
net users. In Africa, with lower incomes and long waiting times&#13;
for installation, and between four to eight users per terminal,&#13;
this figure is likely to be far lower. We assume here that five&#13;
percent of subscribers manage to obtain a second line for Inter-&#13;
net access.&#13;
       It is assumed that an increased number of subscribers will&#13;
increase the number of telephone lines, computers, size of leased&#13;
line/VSAT connections and user support personnel required by&#13;
the ISP. UEM has five technicians working for an estimated 5,000&#13;
users. In Uganda, the charge to users for training is US$8 ini-&#13;
tially with access to free courses every week. This suggests an&#13;
annual per subscriber cost of perhaps US$10 to cover expenses.&#13;
In the U.S., ISPs tend to have one phone line for 10 to 15 sub-&#13;
scribers. NCS in Ghana has 100 dial-in lines for 2,500 subscrib-&#13;
ers. Here we have assumed one phone line for every 20&#13;
subscribers. USAID estimates suggest that a new computer will&#13;
be needed for 1,000 subscribers. UEM is just now considering&#13;
upgrading to a 128kbs link, at a level of approximately 2,000&#13;
subscribers, suggesting that at the moment 64kbs in Africa can&#13;
provide the minimally acceptable level of access for around 3,000&#13;
users. As the comfortable capacity of a 64kbs line is only about&#13;
10 active Internet users at any one time (and figures for&#13;
Mozambique already suggest that the average number of sub-&#13;
scribers on line at any one time must be about 15), providing&#13;
reasonably fast access even at this low level of usage will re-&#13;
quire greater bandwidth - perhaps 64kbs per 1,000 users.&#13;
       It is also assumed that new web subscribers put more pres-&#13;
sti.re on the telephone network, demanding extra switches. This&#13;
is a matter of some debate in the U.S.: we have high and low&#13;
estimates (0.1 and O) for the number of new switches required&#13;
per subscriber, and the figure is likely to be toward the low end&#13;
in Africa because of low levels of usage. Here we assume 0.01.&#13;
      Finally, there are assumptions about the real cost of capital&#13;
for telecommunications companies, ISPs and users, and depre-&#13;
ciation rates for telecommunications equipment, computers and&#13;
other items. In order to provide figures on savings and costs per&#13;
year which include capital expenditures and depreciation rates,&#13;
all capital expenditures and one-off payments on the debit side&#13;
and all one-off receipts on the credit side have been converted&#13;
into yearly costs using the formulae for perpetuities and annu-&#13;
ities. YRC (yearly return to capital) rates equal the cost of capi-&#13;
tal for goods with long lives (E82 to E83) and the annuitized&#13;
cost of capital for goods with shorter lives (calculated E84 to&#13;
E86)). The model assumes that telecommunications companies&#13;
have access to cheaper capital than ISPs and Internet users. It&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       83&#13;

                                             data, we have estimated a four-year replacement period for com-&#13;
                                             puter equipment and 10 years for other items, with a real cost of&#13;
                                             capital at 10 percent for telecommunications companies and 20&#13;
                                             percent forÂ· ISPs (in nominal terms, NCS Ghana pays 25 to 45&#13;
                                             percent per year).&#13;

&#13;
                                             The first section of the model estimates the costs to the subscriber&#13;
                                             and revenue streams to the telephone company based on send-&#13;

                                             nected email and regionally connected email. Across the top of&#13;
                                             the section are the number of pages sent locally (G7 to J7), re-&#13;
                                             gionally (L7 to N7) and internationally (H26 to J26), down the&#13;
                                             side the different methods of sending information, and the rev-&#13;
                                             enues received from the user by the PTT. In the case of interna-&#13;
                                             tional communication, there is a further section (F42 to J47) on&#13;
                                             the amount of revenue received by the PTT from overseas users&#13;
                                             contacting the home user utilizing different forms of communi-&#13;
                                             cation (any telephone-based communication that is received from&#13;
                                             abroad is subject to accounting-rate charges by the home PTT).&#13;
                                                  The local section includes the fixed costs of operating dif-&#13;
                                             ferent communications systems (ignoring the rental and instal-&#13;
                                             lation charges for a telephone line, assumed already there), along&#13;
                                             with the extra costs associated with local calling charges. Under&#13;
                                             the 0 Pages sent/yr column (G9 to G20), the fixed costs of the&#13;
                                             various communications methods are calculated. For voice com-&#13;
                                             munication (G9), the additional fixed cost (above the rental and&#13;
                                             installation charges of the 'phone) is zero. For the fax (GlO), the&#13;
                                             additional cost per year (over the price of a basic phone connec-&#13;
                                             tion) is the cost of a fax spread over its depreciation period. For&#13;
                                             email (Gll and G12), the additional cost per year is the&#13;
                                             annuitized or perpetuitized sum of connection fees and com-&#13;
                                             puter and modem costs and the yearly web connection charge.&#13;
                                             Given that computers are useful for far more than the Internet,&#13;
                                             this can be argued to over-estimate the equipment costs that&#13;
                                             should be associated with user access to the Internet alone.&#13;
                                                  The additional cost per local page sent by phone (HlO to&#13;
                                             J10) is the fixed cost plus the number of pages sent multiplied&#13;
                                             by the time taken to 'speak' one page in turn multiplied by the&#13;
                                             unit cost of calling time. The additional cost per local page sent&#13;
                                             by fax (Hll to Jll) is the number of pages sent multiplied by the&#13;
                                             time taken to fax them in turn multiplied by the unit cost of&#13;
                                             calling time. The additional cost per local page sent by local email&#13;
84&#13;
&amp;#12; (H12 to Jl2) is fixed. It is the local phone call cost of the daily&#13;
 connection time times the number of business days in a year&#13;
 (260). The additional cost per local page sent by regional email&#13;
 (i.e. the user has to make a regional call to access his email) is&#13;
 calculated in the same way (H13 to Jl3), but substituting the&#13;
 cost of a regional call for the cost of a local call in the daily con-&#13;
 nection time.&#13;
       There is no additional cost to users for sending email to&#13;
 regional or international recipients (L19 to N20 and H31 to J32).&#13;
 For,voice and fax, the extra cost is calculated as above. For voice&#13;
 (L17 to N17 and H29 to J29), then, this is number of pages mul-&#13;
 tiplied by time taken to speak a page multiplied by the unit cost&#13;
 of a regional or international call. For fax (L18 to N18 and H30&#13;
 to J30), this is number of pages multiplied by time taken to speak&#13;
 (fax) a page multiplied by the unit cost of a regional or interna-&#13;
 tional call.&#13;
       The phone company receives no revenue from fixed costs&#13;
 of communication (beyond the installation and rental of the&#13;
 phone line, which is excluded from the calculation). Revenue&#13;
 from local (G17 to J17) and regional (L17 to M17) voice calls is&#13;
 based purely on the length of connection time and the charges&#13;
 for calls made. This is the same with local (G18 to J18) and re-&#13;
 gional (L18 to Â¥18) faxes.&#13;
       In the case of international calls, the picture is complicated&#13;
 a little by accounting charges. The phone company has to pass&#13;
 on half of the accounting rate value of the call to the telco that&#13;
 provides the other half of the circuit. For voice (H29 to J29)and&#13;
 fax (H30 to J30), then, the calculation is the time taken to speak&#13;
 (fax) the number of pages multiplied by the unit cost of the call&#13;
 minus the time taken to speak (fax) the number of pages multi-&#13;
 plied by half of the accounting rate paid to the foreign telecom-&#13;
 munications company.&#13;
       The telecommunications company also receives accounting&#13;
 rate payments from foreign telecommunications companies&#13;
 originating incoming voice and fax communication with the&#13;
  home user. For voice (H45 to J45) and fax (H46 to J46), this&#13;
  amounts to the time taken to speak (send) the number of pages&#13;
  multiplied by one half of the accounting rate.&#13;
        For email, the amount that the telecommunications com-&#13;
  pany receives from the user is fixed, as we saw above. For local&#13;
  access email (H12 to J12), and regional access email (H13 to Jl3),&#13;
Â· the receipts equal the by minute cost of the call multiplied by&#13;
  the time taken each day to access email multiplied by the num-&#13;
  ber of business days in a year (260). This is the only incremental&#13;
  cost of email, whatever the destination or source of communi-&#13;
  cation. Therefore, the extra costs associated with regional or in-&#13;
  ternational emailing is zero (L19 to N20, H38 to J39 and H37 to&#13;
  J37).&#13;

                                                                          85&#13;

&#13;
                                             The second part of the model looks at the detailed effects on&#13;
                                             telecommunications and ISP revenue and user costs and sav-&#13;
                                             ings of some fixed level of Internet usage. The ISP is assumed to&#13;
                                             be a monopoly provider, to simplify the model. This is a clear&#13;
                                             over-simplification. Already, much of Africa has multiple Inter-&#13;
                                             net service providers. The effect on the model of this simplifica-&#13;
                                             tion is to overestimate ISP profits and reduce telecommunications&#13;
                                             company revenue from ISPs (because of multiple leased lines,&#13;
                                             more phone lines and more licenses). This will also slightly over-&#13;
                                             estimate telecommunications company revenue from users, be-&#13;
                                             cause it is likely that, with more ISPs, a larger percentage of users&#13;
                                             can make a local call to connect to the Internet.&#13;
                                                   The section is divided in two. On the left (F49 to G93) is a&#13;

                                             users, based on the number of Internet users entered at C24&#13;
                                             ("number of Internet users"). The second section is a model of&#13;
                                             the potential impact of the Internet on ISPs, telecommunications&#13;

                                             Telecommunications companies will gain revenue from second&#13;
                                             Internet user lines. This will be based on the number of new&#13;
                                             lines (number of users multiplied the percentage who are esti-&#13;
                                             mated to take second lines) multiplied by the revenue (rental&#13;
                                             and installation) that these lines provide (G51).&#13;
                                                  Telecommunications companies will also receive revenues&#13;
                                             from expanded Internet traffic. The (smaller) part of this will&#13;
                                             come from users accessing email. As above, this is assumed to&#13;
                                             be a fixed length call every day. The first part of the equation&#13;
                                             calculates the cost of calls for accessing email for local and then&#13;
                                             regional users based on the number of users, the amount of time&#13;
                                             taken to access email, the number of business days and the cost&#13;
                                             of a local (regional) call of the duration inputted in E71 ("Email&#13;
                                             is accessed every business day for X minutes"). The second part&#13;
                                             of the equation calculates the cost of calls involved in accessing&#13;
                                             the web - average number of hours users access the Web (in-&#13;
                                             putted in C30), multiplied by the cost of a local (regional) hour-&#13;
                                             long call.&#13;
                                                   Telecommunications companies are also assumed to make&#13;
                                             money from licensing ISPs. As the model assumes a monopoly&#13;
                                             provider, this equals the input from C44 ("License"). Telecom-&#13;
&#13;
86&#13;
&amp;#12;munications companies will also receive revenue from the rental&#13;
costs of phone lines into ISPs. This is based on the assumption&#13;
of the number of subscribers that can be handled per line (E75)&#13;
multiplied by the revenue (rental and installation) that these lines&#13;
provide (G55).&#13;
      It is assumed that the telecommunications company pro-&#13;
vides the ISP's international connection. No matter how many&#13;
web subscribers, it is assumed that email alone will not require&#13;
the provision of an expanded leased line. The theoretical maxi-&#13;
mum data that could be transmitted by a 64 kbps line over one&#13;
year is equivalent to 210 million minutes of voice communica-&#13;
tions (total outgoing telephone traffic from Mozambique totaled&#13;
16.4m minutes in 1995). This suggests that email (without the&#13;
web) does not require large capacity (further evidence is that&#13;
the NSFNET backbone in the US was only 56kbps as recently as&#13;
five years ago). It is the increasing use of the web that will drive&#13;
the need for ever-larger international Internet access capacity.&#13;
As above, the equation (G55) is based on the assumption of the&#13;
number of subscribers that can be handled per 64kbs of VSAT&#13;
or leased line connection (E77) multiplied by the charge for that&#13;
line. The model assumes a flat fee for each 64kbs of connection&#13;
to the backbone by the telecommunications company and for-&#13;
eign providers. This is an over-simplification - telecommuni-&#13;
cations companies will charge less for a 128kbs connection than&#13;
they would for two 64 connections.&#13;
&#13;
Telecommunications company revenue lost&#13;
&#13;
In calculating telecommunications revenue lost, we have as-&#13;
sumed that there is no substitution between WWW access and&#13;
phone or voice usage, the only substitution is via email. This is&#13;
an obvious oversimplification. Accessing websites provides an&#13;
alternative way of obtaining data, which might well substitute&#13;
for a voice or fax communication to find the information. How-&#13;
ever, it is very difficult to estimate what percentage of web us-&#13;
age time is substituting for voice or fax, and it is even more&#13;
difficult to calculate a "conversion rate" between Web down-&#13;
loads and fax or voice. It is, for example, questionable that a&#13;
Website that uses frames and moving graphics imparts far more&#13;
valuable information than a site created without these features.&#13;
The difference in terms of data transfer can be immense, how-&#13;
ever. The effect of ignoring Web substitution while fully account-&#13;
ing for Web use will be to underestimate the revenue losses on&#13;
telecommunications companies of Internet access.&#13;
      Looking first at substitution of outgoing international calls&#13;
(G60) this equation calculates the amount of international email&#13;
traffic that is substituting for international outgoing voice traf-&#13;
fic. First, the number of "pages" of email sent internationally in&#13;
                                                                       87&#13;
&amp;#12;Economic Toolkit for African Policy Makers&#13;
                                             place of a telephone call is calculated. This is equal to the sum of&#13;
                                             the proportion of email that replace phone calls multiplied by&#13;
                                             the proportion of email going to an international destination in&#13;
                                             turn multiplied by the average number of email sent per year,&#13;
                                             their average length and the number of users. This number of&#13;
                                             pages estimate is multiplied by the revenue generated by one&#13;
                                             "page" of an international voice call -the cost of a call long&#13;
                                             enough to "speak" a page minus the accounting rate payment.&#13;
                                                   The international faxes out (G61) calculation follows the&#13;
                                             same procedure as above, only substituting the percentage of&#13;
                                             information sent by fax for the percentage of information sent&#13;
                                             by telephone, and using the number of kb in a three minute fax&#13;
                                             (144 kb) for the amount of information in a three minute voice&#13;
                                             call. The international calls and faxes in (G62 to G63) calculates&#13;
                                             accounting rate losses, assuming that international email com-&#13;
                                             munication into a country has the same percentage substitution&#13;
                                             rate for fax and voice (which might be an over-simplification).&#13;
                                             This calculation is a repeat of the ones above, except that it cal-&#13;
                                             culates the accounting rate charges lost by the home telecom-&#13;
                                             munications company based on the amount of incoming email.&#13;
                                             The amount of incoming email is calculated by subtracting the&#13;
                                             average number of email sent locally and regionally from the&#13;
                                             average number of email received (each email sent locally or&#13;
                                             regionally must be received locally or regionally, so any residual&#13;
                                             from this calculation must be email received from abroad).&#13;
                                                   The rest of the equations follow the pattern set above, with&#13;
                                             the replacement of international data with regional and local&#13;
                                             data (C23 to G27 and G35 to G38) and the removal of the ac-&#13;
                                             counting rate adjustments.&#13;
&#13;
                                             International ISP&#13;
&#13;
                                             Next, international ISP costs and revenues are calculated (G77).&#13;
                                             The first equation calculates equipment costs. This includes num-&#13;
                                             ber of computers and the size of the VSAT I leased line connec-&#13;
                                             tion required to service the number of users (G76 to G77). The&#13;
                                             cost of administrative computers, fixed other computer costs and&#13;
                                             setup costs for the VSAT /LL connection (C59-C61) is multiplied&#13;
                                             by the yearly return requirement for computer equipment while&#13;
                                             other setup costs (assumed fixed) are multiplied by the return&#13;
                                             requirement for other equipment.&#13;
                                                  Internet and telecom charges (G78) include the cost of the&#13;
                                             yearly license fee, the backbone connection, the charge for the&#13;
                                             number of phone lines the ISP needs, the home charge for the&#13;
                                             VSAT or leased line connection required and the foreign coun-&#13;
                                             try charge for the VSAT or leased line connection required. Sal-&#13;
                                             ary and maintenance charges (G79) includes recurrent costs and&#13;
                                             maintenance costs (C65) and a calculation of the cost for user&#13;
&#13;
88&#13;
&amp;#12;support multiplied by the number of users (E74 and C24).&#13;
&#13;
User costs, savings&#13;
&#13;
User costs and savings are calculated for the total user base.&#13;
Equipment costs (G87) amount to the yearly return cost value of&#13;
the amount spent on modems and computers. Internet access&#13;
(G88) paid to ISPs is thus the annualized cost of initial connec-&#13;
tion multiplied by the yearly fee. The charge for the "fixed costs"&#13;
of web access and accessing email (G89) include the installation&#13;
and rental of second lines and the calculation of regional and&#13;
local call charges for 260 days of email access, as above, multi-&#13;
plied by the number of users. Web telephone charges (G90)&#13;
amount to the cost of a local/ regional three minute call multi-&#13;
plied by twenty (to give an approximate cost of an hour-long&#13;
call) multiplied by the number of hours on line, calculated for&#13;
local and then regional users. For the user, telephone savings&#13;
equal the revenue lost to the telecommunications company ex-&#13;
cluding the calculations made for accounting charges (G60 to&#13;
G61 minus the accounting rate adjustment and G64 to G67).&#13;
      The final part of the model calculates hypothetical cost and&#13;
revenue streams from expanded Internet access (J51 to N75).&#13;
These calculations are largely based on those above. We have&#13;
assumed that future users will utilize the Internet as much as&#13;
the first users on whom email substitution rates and Web access&#13;
rates are based. Given that we would expect the first Internet&#13;
users to be those with the most to gain in communications sav-&#13;
ings and Web access, this is an oversimplification. Later users&#13;
will be those who make fewer international calls and have less&#13;
interest in accessing the Web. These estimates exaggerate ISP&#13;
equipment needs, telecom income losses from substitution and&#13;
new equipment needs, telecom gains from time spent on the Web&#13;
and user costs and benefits. Given the fixed costs of email, this&#13;
will mean that user benefits from substitution are overestimated.&#13;
As ISP revenues are (in this model) independent of usage, their&#13;
profits will be higher. The negative effect of email substitution&#13;
will be lower for telecommunications companies. The revenues&#13;
from web surfing will be somewhat lower as will the costs of&#13;
providing new equipment. Under usual circumstances, this sug-&#13;
gests that the model will overestimate the negative effects of an&#13;
expanded Internet on telecommunications companies.&#13;
&#13;
ISP, hypothetical cost, revenue&#13;
&#13;
ISP costs, as above, have a fixed component (K53). This consists&#13;
of a license, phone installation and rental, basic computer equip-&#13;
ment, other setup costs, fixed setup costs for the leased line/&#13;
VSAT, local telecommunications company charges for the VSAT I&#13;

                                             connection to the Internet backbone. As more users are added,&#13;
                                             costs go up (L53 to N53). New subscribers require more user&#13;
                                             support, more telephones, more computers and a larger VSAT /&#13;

                                             connection fee and a fixed yearly fee multiplied by the number&#13;

                                             The telecommunications company revenue calculation (K62 to&#13;
                                             N62) is made as above ((G51 to G55), taking account of new&#13;

                                             munications companies (K63 to N63) is based on a new formula&#13;
                                             (above, we only calculated revenues). The calculation is based&#13;
                                             on the cost of installing and operating the telecommunications&#13;
                                             equipment involved in servicing ISPs and user. These costs in&#13;
                                             turn are: the cost of running the VSAT or leased line, the initial&#13;
                                             user line into the ISP, the cost of subsequent lines into the ISP&#13;
                                             and out of the users who order a second line, the cost of ex-&#13;
                                             panding VSAT connections or leased line connections and the&#13;
                                             cost of providing extra switch and transmit equipment to handle&#13;
                                             the longer calls made to access the Internet. The total of present&#13;

                                             cal users over present day users in the model, to give a&#13;
                                             straight-line estimate of revenue lost to email substitution. This&#13;
                                             is an over-simplification - as the number of email users in the&#13;
                                             country increases, the percentage of email with a local destina-&#13;
                                             tion will increase. A straight-line estimate will thus over-esti-&#13;

&amp;#12;Calculations&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
E82-83: To calculate the yearly return to capital required to pay&#13;
the cost of capital (for goods for which do not need to be re-&#13;
placed) and depreciation (for goods that will have to be re-&#13;
placed), the following equations were used: The formula for a&#13;
perpetuity is PV= C/ r, where PV is the present value, C the yearly&#13;
cash payment and r the real cost of capital. The yearly cash pay-&#13;
ment required to cover a present value expenditure is C= PV*r.&#13;
For one off payments for goods which have a very long life (for&#13;
example, telephone connection for the recipient) or one-off re-&#13;
ceipts (for example, the payment for initial telephone connec-&#13;
tion for the telephone company), this formula was used to&#13;
calculate the effective yearly cash cost or income of the present&#13;
payment or receipt. Thus, the YRC (yearly return to capital) rate&#13;
is equal to r, the cost of capital.&#13;
      E84 to E86: The formula for an annuity is PV= C[l Ir -1 I r(l&#13;
+ r)At], where PV is the present value, C the yearly cash pay-&#13;
ment, r the real cost of capital and t the number of years over&#13;
which the annuity is paid. The yearly cash payment required to&#13;
cover a present value expenditure for a good that will need to&#13;
be replaced int years is C= PV /[1/r - 1/r(l + r)At]. For one-off&#13;
purchases of goods that have a short life (for instance, comput-&#13;
ers), this formula was used to calculate the effective yearly cash&#13;
cost or income of the present purchase. Thus, the YRC (yearly&#13;
return to capital) rate is equal to [1 I cost of capital - 1 /(cost of&#13;
capital* ((1 + cost of capital) I\ number of years depreciation))]&#13;

            policy makers
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Liberalization of the telecommunications
            sector is progressing across Africa. One of the most
            important benefits of this trend is that it will make
            value-added services, particularly internet access, more
            affordable and reliable for telecommunications users in the
            continent.  The internet need not be a useful tool only for
            industrial societies. The poor in many African countries,
            struggling to meet basic needs, often remain poor not only-
            because they are denied access to physical and human
            capital, but also because they lack the information
            necessary to best convert that capital into wealth. By
            opening wide the door to a huge store of global knowledge,
            the Internet offers untapped possibilities to address the
            blight of information poverty. This toolkit is inspired by
            the African experience where access to the World Wide Web is
            helping doctors to save patients, schools to educate
            children, and communities to create businesses that will
            lift them out of destitution. This toolkit closely examines
            these issues. It finds that, in the long term, the internet
            cannot be looked upon as a threat to telecommunications
            companies. It is true that it is one of a range of
            technological advances that are forcing changes in the
            operation of telecommunications systems, but it also
            presents opportunities for new sources of revenues and new
            ways to meet the demands of society. The Internet has become
            a tool for development, with its ability to facilitate the
            delivery of social services, disaster mitigation, and
            poverty relief. The Toolkit also finds that the move toward
            liberalization is likely to have a beneficial effect on
            Internet roll out, just as it has on basic service provision.
