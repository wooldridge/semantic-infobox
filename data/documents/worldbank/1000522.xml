included advice to countries upon their re-&#13;
quest on five draft investment laws and advice&#13;
to governments and foreign investors on draft&#13;
arbitration provisions of a dozen international&#13;

an Expert Group convened by the OECD to&#13;
help develop the dispute-settlement provisions&#13;
of the projected Multilateral Agreement on&#13;

The accompanying statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted ac-&#13;
counting principles in the United States and with International Accounting Standards and in accordance&#13;
with the Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum) between the International&#13;
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) and the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development (the Bank) which became effective as of October 14, 1966. The Memorandum pro-&#13;
vides that, except to the extent that the Centre may be reimbursed by the parties to proceedings for fees&#13;
and expenses of members of Conciliation Commissions, Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the&#13;
Bank shall provide the following facilities and services to the Centre:&#13;
(1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
(2) other administrative services and facilities, such as travel, communications, office accommoda-&#13;
tions, furniture, equipment, supplies and printing.&#13;

Annex 3 (continued)&#13;
These expenditures represent only the amounts identified by the Bank as being directly re-&#13;
lated to the Centre.&#13;
The Centre does not have resources of its own. The Centre's expenses which are attributable&#13;
to arbitration proceedings are borne by the parties in accordance with the Centre's Administra-&#13;
tive and Financial Regulations. In accordance with these Regulations, the Secretary-General calls&#13;
on the parties to make advance deposits with the Centre from time to time to defray these ex-&#13;
penses. If, after the completion of an arbitration proceeding, it is determined that there is a cash&#13;
surplus, such surplus shall be refunded to the parties in proportion to the amounts advanced to&#13;
the Centre.&#13;

To International Centre for Settlement&#13;
of Investment Disputes&#13;
In our opinion, the accompanying statement of net assets for ICSID proceedings and the related&#13;
statement of changes in cash and investments for ICSID proceedings present fairly, in all material&#13;
respects, the financial position of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes at&#13;
June 30, 1996 andJune 30, 1995, and changes in its cash and investments for the years endedJune&#13;
30, 1996 and June 30, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the&#13;
United States and with International Accounting Standards, and in accordance with the Adminis-&#13;
trative Arrangements between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the&#13;
Bank) and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre). These finan-&#13;
cial statements are the responsibility of the Bank's and the Centre's management; our responsibil-&#13;
ity is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our&#13;
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including&#13;
International Standards on Auditing, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain&#13;
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An&#13;
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the&#13;
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made&#13;
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our&#13;
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This annual report of the International
            Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) covers
            the fiscal year July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996. During fiscal
            year 1996, there was further growth in ICSID membership. At
            the close of the fiscal year, there were 139 signatory
            States of the Convention and 126 member countries of ICSID.
            Investment treaties continued to proliferate during the
            year. Most of these treaties provide for the settlement by
            ICSID arbitration of disputes arising out of investments
            covered by the treaties. Some of the laws and treaties also
            provide for the possibility of submitting such disputes to
            ad hoc arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United
            Nations Commission on International Trade Law, with the
            ICSID Secretary-General as the designated appointing
            authority of arbitrators. These trends were reflected in the
            Centre's caseload during 1996. The Centre also carried
            out research, publications, and advisory work in the fields
            of arbitration and investment law. Another noteworthy
            activity was ICSID's participation in meetings of an
            Expert Group convened by the Organization for Economic
            Cooperation and Development to help develop the
            dispute-settlement provisions of the projected Multilateral
            Agreement on Investment.
